Miitopia is one of my and my sister's favourite game, and I like creating cursed miis
One thing I absolutely love about the jealous scenes is that they can happen if the mii is sick, they're too sick to move or even eat, but when another mii hangs out with their friend they get the power to climb up to the second floor and watch through the window
As someone who played both the 3DS and Switch version's of Miitopia, I personally do enjoy the additions the Switch port of the game brought.
The game pretty much only has 3 scenes where it actually takes itself seriously and that’s it 😭 Everything else is memes
If you still have Super Smash Brothers Ultimate can you try making a Mii avatar of yourself To team up with your Favorite Smash fighters against the other Smash fighters you hate? Team Battle style, There is such thing as team battle on Super Smash Brothers. Can you make that a video on Youtube sometime?
5:10 it took 4 years but they did it
I will stand by this until my grave. The Miis are the greatest thing to come from a Nintendo console, and deserve more love from Nintendo.
Mii, mii, mii...    Mii 2.
Tomodochi life 2 is coming in 2026
5:13 _The Flesh must consume_
5:07: “I really hope a sequel to Tomodachi Life is announced” Took a while, but you got your wish.
The thing about Miitopia is just that it’s peak. Even the music joins in on the fun.  Btw, give “Dark Lord’s Theme” a listen and you’ll question if it’s actually from Miitopia and not Final Fantasy XV
この動画で初めてあなたを知りましたが、こんなに最高のデザインのMiiは今まで一度も見たことがなくて感動しました！ （私の知るほとんどの"素晴らしい"Miiは、せいぜい有名キャラクターの顔を高い再現度で真似するだけで、Miitopiaのキャラメイクの必然性がありませんでした。また、笑ったり怖がったりする度に、急にからし種の様に小さな目が現れて現実に引き戻される"高い再現度"にはうんざりでした…） あなたのMiiキャラクターデザインが最高すぎるので、これからの人生はずっと亡霊を追いかけて過ごすことになると思います。いい人生になりそうです！ 素晴らしいMiiを見せていただきありがとうございます！ いつかあなたの様な高いレベルのキャラメイクができるよう、努力します！！
Alas, 3 years later, the Access Code seems not to work. :(
im back from spain!!! long time no see!!!!
5:07 well… we just got that
You called it! We're living the dream!
At last, Scott addressing Miitopia for what it really is: Fanfiction Mad Libs
Well. About dat tomodachi life :D
2:25 That’s the Tomodachi Life trailer.
Can I get some pepper on here too please???
I swear this game can read our mii... Regardless of the characters, 90% of the dialogues end up working and being in character
The code isn’t working :(
One of my characters has her eyes covered and a frown. So literally every animation is with a frown. Shocked? Frown. Happy? Frown. It's funny to look at tbh
I feel kinda isolated from this broader, better side of the Miitopia community cause my only Nintendo devices have always been a DS, a 3DS and finally a New 3DS. Always been a Switch disliker (because "why the hell is Nintendo doing stuff like this", I promise the hate made sense when it came out), so since a bit before the servers closure for Nintendos I've moved on to PC.   Of course, I was a HUGE fan of Miitopia and Tomodachi Life. Hell I played them to exhaustion back in the days where they were hot. And I can tell you, the 3DS Miitopia was crazy back then. Spectacular game that had no business being that good, in every aspect. An alternative, enhanced Tomodachi Life.   This rambling is just a way to release nostalgia and a bit of frustration. Miitopia could've been this good in 3DS, but was gatekept by Nintendo itself behind a massive paywall of a console that was only slightly better than a DS, and leagues worse than any console or computer. Another DS could've been viable, yet the design was declared obsolete.  Man, DS really ended up badly off for being so good in the past. The games, the small but strong communities of every game. Time passes, and it sucks.
I love this game so much 😭, I've made a separate file so I can do a second playthrough with my ocs, my first playthrough was with my friends and random memes XD I made myself the great sage in the second playthrough and my protagonist is the main character in my current series, It felt fitting.
1:32 grunkle stunkle wins the funkle bunkle
3:14 while my characters werea full set of ocs, when i made the horse i made both the hooves and fetlocks black... which made it look like the horse was wearing boots. gave it googly eyes and i roleplayed it being a bad 2-person costume with visible thread lines. what was the name of such a mighty steed? Notahorse! oh and i did actually 99% the 3ds version (failed to do it correctly with finishing the bestiary and softlocked myself out of it being possible unless i was to send the main character to the villa for weeks on end) and i gotta say, pretty much everything about the switch version is an upgrade! well, there was one downside. you need to pay to subscribe to nintendo online if you wanna receive other mii characters or even those popular ones from the 3ds era. this was the game that actually forced me to finally pay up for it the moment i got to greenhorne town :c
Wow. I really need to get this re-release some time. I had no idea the character creator was that robust.
The worst thing is when you accidentally remove makeup
Yan dev being the villain is perfect
"Dark lord H.someSquidward" "Darkest Lord Garfield" -Choctopus
Nah. Princesses always live in another castle.  -A random party member, Miitopia
You should be allowed to change a mii’s face in an emote. Like I was making a sans face and I wanted to change the anger face, but couldn’t.
I played 3ds ver and i feel robbed 🥲 (spent so much extra money for no differebce except better charac creator and horse)
Oh boy if you think this game is good check out Fantasy Life that's getting a sequel on the switch on the 10 10 2024
I set my great sage as Hatsune Miku bc yes
1:48 ❤
1:57  lol
For anyone wondering, the outdo theme i think is rhythm heaven remix 10(the older one, the more pixelated one not the new one)
Some of the first oc’s I made in miitopia were not just me and my friends but also the castle residents. They were all just food jokes lol. I mean, Pat Pizza was an excuse to make a PizzaHead (from pizza tower) mii.
Mario, Beedle, Dark lord Yan Dev and DK is just TOO RANDOM
My first mii for miitopia was another random joke me I made, and he nearly made it to the end, had recovered all of my party and then had factory reset my switch and just recently started over, and I'm basing my entire party on the rentarou family from 100 kanojo
I swear this game makes me want to replay it over and over again! I don’t want the game’s story to end.. And I’m not even done yet!
“It’s the dark lord…. SAITAMA” I love making Saitama and Sans reoccuing characters I also have a Luffy, Miku, Cali, and Marie
I know im a year late.. (and still playing the game)  But i like how he doesnt even touch on how the story kinda goes. Like how your party is dragged away at a point and you're in charge of rescuing them and i didn't see a single image of the great sage lmao (might've just missed it)
I will forever have a hate for twitch because of this I came across Scott falco channel in 2023 and now found this video and was hoping to watch his play through of this for some good laugh but now I found out that twitch permanently deleted videos that are just a few month old so I will never get to enjoy his play through because they are gone completely with no way to get them back thank you so much twitch
We really need a tomodachi life switch with miitopia Switch's mii creation tools
Could you tell me the miitopia access code
0:23 Erm what the sigma
E3 hahaha what that
Wait why do your characters look so good 😭
Man I’m a miitopia og had it in the 3Ds loved it
Why is sig jealous of me?😂
Whoops I came to the party very late 2 years late.
You know, you can edit the horse's appearance at an inn, right, you don't need the poor thing to be an abomination
Kinda stinks the game only plays itself.
the music at 4:39 is called Battle: Now's Our Chance! for anyone wondering what that fire song was called
I keep clicking on ur stupid videos thinking i'm gonna get a funny animation video but it just ends up being your horrible voice talking over barley any included animations
I keep clicking on ur stupid videos thinking i'm gonna get a funny animation video but it just ends up being your horrible voice talking over barley any included animations
Falco is cringe
I would describe this game with one sentence: the perfect mess
I really want tomodachi life w/switch miitopia level customization
That Purah Mii definetly aged well
Where can i find his streams of this game? a friend asked me to look for them, but i cannot find them, not even on his Twitch. Could somebody share a link please? i wanna help my friend
If only they made a new Tomodachi life for whatever new console Nintendo 's going to give us😢😂
5:10 well THAT aged poorly
Hey when you can make the princess look like majima then you know we can never go back
I would love the Switch 2 to have this Mii creator in it. The possibilities are infinite.
I really want the switch version 😢
DARK LORD YANDEV IM GOING TO FUCKING CRY LMAOOO
The only game where Yoshi, Morton, Ozzy Osbourne and Papyrus can defeat Pharaoh Reggie
Crazy how this amazing port of an amazing Mii game is almost 3 years old.
Man, I’m sad the DS didn’t get the new Miitopia features.
0:40 we gonna talk about that booster being in hd 2 years before the game got remastred or how accurate it is?
You can make your ocs interact with other characters in a fun and charming way or mabye use miis through access keys and wifi to overflow the cast with memes, and a bit of both. I had lots of fun when i was playing this game and the only grain salt i give is that they dont have a option to pick between save files so you dont have to reset the game evrey time to play again.
(Cough cough) the 3ds version was better
yan-dev being the dark lord sure did age well
4:49 he knew.
0:27 September was here
I have searched high and low and I cannot find where to watch this. I have even checked past videos on the Twitch and it’s not there. Where can I watch it?
I had the og miitopia  I got the Nintendo version because of the horse Finally made it past land of the fey in this version
Heh heh dark lord yandev
As someone who played on the 3rd title; they’re both great games and the Switch takes the cake every time.
Pretty funny that Yandev is good villain
Tomotachi Life 2 when
I've played both and did not get bored the second time
I played the 3DS and the switch definitely has more charm. HD effects are one thing; but the horse, the detailed faces, and taking the wiis to different locations for bonding was NOT included.
I think the 3ds miitopia is slightly harder then the switch version.
I definitely enjoyed Miitopia and always chose many of the miis I created and put them as side characters or big bads or even the main character since I could choose any of them to be a hero and ship certain characters with others like I shipped Kirby with a wolf because yes and I shipped sonic.exe with that crazy fangirl sky because I was going exe crazy at the time all and all I had a fun experience with the game
Salty.
This is the only game that you can have Luigi, Minecraft Steve, Clash of clans Barbarian and ZOroark from Pokemon in the same game💀💀💀💀
Russia: Miitopia is rated 18+ here Nintendo: Because of the Twerky, right?  Russia:  Nintendo: …because of the Twerky, right..?
hehehe
CC is so cute
1:51 So cute!
goro majima as a mii character-
4:50 really aged well huh?
Ah yes, when your teammate in question doesn’t follow your orders. I died multiple times because the healer on our team ignored me dying.
0:40 what's the NOVA Mii creator code?
@ScottFalco the access code didn't work
I got the game and I stopl playing it but now I want to start playing it again
This video perfectly describes the game and I’m still playing it (I’m at the darker lord section)
Honestly, I was surprised by how fun the game was, even if you completely cut the character creation out of the equation. Granted, I know it's like going to a 5 star buffet just for the water and some bread, but it's honestly pretty good water and bread
My copy of Miitopia on the 3DS was stolen with my 3DS before I could finish it so it was nice to be able to play and beat the game with all the new things the switch version had to offer, I honestly had a blast playing it and would love to see tomodachi life on the switch
Basically Miitopia combat in a nutshell 1:47 lol
Lum is goated don’t listen to them 😤😤😤
I have played the 3ds version and the main drawback of the switch version is that it loses its original charm like on the 3ds it has bad graphics for today's standards but they're weirdly charming and the bottom screen menu was really cool with the aesthetic of having the UI and it's much quicker to have it forever open on the bottom screen rather than having to press a button scroll through a menu I have let more miis die on the switch version than the 3ds version due to this
anyone who has oc’s MUST play this game.
rip his code doesnt work anymore
I actually played 3ds, and it was fun! The tracks were really enjoyable, the events, classes, story, and more were all really fun! My favorite line has to be "Praise be to the deity of well-placed inns!", and seeing the switch port include more than whats on the base game excites me. I havent gotten a chance for the port though.
I played miitopia for the first time 2 weeks ago for 5 hours. And I gotta say, it was fun as hell!
God bless. I loved Miitopia on the 3DS!
2:38 So basically, you can all cuck each other... In a Nintendo game. Kill me.
it's been a year since I've actually touched the switch game, and man am I getting memories of staying up playing the game under my covers on the 3Ds. I was astounded by the customization of characters we get with Miitopia being on the switch, I was also surprised by the horse. Who in an attempt of naming Seagrass I named seagraa instead. A weird win to a horse who is now apart of my team and name will always somewhat irk me. But I still love him
Darkest lord theme. if you haven’t heard it, G U I T A R
Spoilers        How fun that by making Yandere-Dev the dark lord, you’ve inadvertently given him a redemption arc XD
Ever beat the game and then continue playing? If you haven't beat the game yet, there's spoilers and you've been warned but...    I don't think anyone talks about/plays this game anymore but anyone who does still, once you beat the game, 2 new islands and the Villa is accessed. Am I the only one to know of this secret or does anyone else know of this.
THE 1ST MII THAT APPEARS, (the one that walks with ScottFalco) IS GONNA GIVE ME NIGHTMARES!
Sonic fights alongside mario, nicki minaj, and bob from bobs burgers to defeat toby fox
How did people didn’t see the 3ds version and then love this
Revelation 14:12   12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
I played the DS original And The differences are uncanny believe me
(<0_<0) ?
진짜 사랑해요
My mage somehow hates every single magic and mp raising food in existence. She is pain
Miitopia is amazing! So is the 3ds version. Now since I am poor and have a bias I must say. OBVIOUSLY the switch port sucks
I pre ordered miitopia for 3ds, I'm an og
istg this guy have had better fully played the game because its a very good game tbh
I’ve actually played the 3ds version most big features such as the character creator and horse
Who is cc?
I made everyone variations of my Mii Dark Lord Conner, Great Sage Conner, Genie Conner  EVERYONE IS CONNER
When you accidentally put everything on the eyes and they blink
The post game of miitopia is way more fun than it has any right to be. Also the final boss music unironically the best song ever composed for a video game and no one is allowed to argue.
Fun fact if you attak an enemy you taemmates attak that enemy too
nice
I made all my party members characters from Dungeon Crawlers and Rougelikes. The main mii was the Bullet Kin from Enter The Gungeon. Everyone else was: Isaac from The Binding Of Isaac Cadence from Crypt Of The Necrodancer Guy Spelunky from Spelunky Roffy D. Sloth from Spelunky 2 The Lamb from Cult Of The Lamb Ally from Cat Lady Fish from Nuclear Throne Hairry from The Slimeking's Tower Will from Moonlighter And post game: Little Red Riding Hood from Night Of The Full Moon All npcs were JoJo characters, with the prince being Polnareff and the genie being Judgement.
I really want to play this game although I only have 2 oc's
I chose to restart my Miitopia adventure to make only original characters. I'm only in the first part of the adventure, but I will miss the current lineup when I have to reset for the next world. (Also I'm 99% sure all of my current party members are bisexual and I love it LOL)
3:14 I made one that was a robot
If I hadn't worn out the 3DS version I would have gotten the remake. It does look fun though...  Tomodachi Life though, that definitely needs a remake/sequel.
Bro imagine if they added a custom head sculpter
You chose the same first mii classes as me
NOT fun fact: this game is rated 18 in russia just because you can make same sex couples
I want Tomodachi life for the switch! That would be nice!
I love tomodachi life! And miitopia!
I had miitopia on the 3ds, and the switch version is better
omg scott falco real
Groovy.
This game is an acid trip I’d gladly take any day.
Yo, what the heck is CCs voice. I recognize it from somewhere but can't place it
for some reason, i have the 3DS version (which i Iove and am currently replaying), but i just feel like it wouldn't be the same on the switch even though it's objectively better. maybe it's just that i like the 3DS, maybe it's just nostalgia. but i just can't for the life of me see the switch version and want to play it.
I love miitopia! It’s so fun to replay with different character combinations. Once I did an all marvel characters play through, it was great 😂 what really sells it is that you get to choose their personalities along with their class, and you can control which characters have a better relationship with each other than others. Without that, the characters would feel more flat
I imagine Scott whispers cc to his gf while he has sex with her
1:32 STANLEY
And Matt’s
Yep I made an army of Burgerkings
Coincidentally, I also had my OCs as the majority of my party members for my playthrough, the only exceptions being myself as the hero and my sister as one of the party members.
I have Miitopia on the 3DS but not on the switch. I still like the 3DS version but MAN AM I MISSING SOMETHING
as someone who played the 3ds version, the switch port was kind of a let down cause it was talking about "new content" and then the only thing added was the horse and i didn't bother buying the switch port cause i'd already 100%ed the game
Great, now I’m gonna have nightmares of that Flesh Horse.
This is literally exactly what I do even playing as Chef
4:40 song?
WALLACE WHAT YOU DOING
I wish they make DLC for this game
My first Miitopia playthrough was just chaos. I didn't have Nintendo Switch Online, so I had to make all my own Miis, and I'd say I did a good job. My team for the final world was made up of Johnathan Donathan (An OC me and my friends made, who is apparently the hottest man on Earth despite having lips like a rasher, a nose like an upside-down piece of toast and the mother of all unibrows), Gordon Ramsay, Hatsune Miku and Sans. I'm working on a sequel to that playthrough and it's even more chaotic.
Yeah I played the ds version and it pretty good
how do people not know lum???
1:28 why are bf and gf the picky couple!? That seems out of character as they are a dynamic duo who will do anything to protect the other and never ever get into arguments
I made the Dark Lord into the leader of the bad guys of World War 2, and then handsome squidward
The fact i still play the 2ds version in 2022...
They NEED to update the mii creator!
CC: "This trap will keep me safe" Me: "Hmm, I wonder if CC is a thief"
I am I am watching this video and this is getting a remake
I loved it on the 3DS and I have one question, where was the salt? All I heard was good things, and I agree
This game is the definition of blursed.
Is cyborg-chan still an Inkling?
Seeing sig abd tessa is always nice
My first playthrough I decided on the second round of Miis to only take a single character besides myself into battle and only bond with them. It was good; me and Catboy Waluigi got closer than any other Mii. Everyone else stayed level one, but who cares, right?     Then I hit the final boss.
Whenever I first got the jealousy event, it seemed normal at first...    ...until I remembered that the characters were interacting on the second floor, then I couldn't get the sight of my character crawling up the building like a spider.
I played the 3ds title witch didn’t have The horse so it was great to see new mechanics
Wait has he gotten to the fey realm yet? The second enemy you encounter there is the most infamous one in the entirety of Miitopia (I played it on the switch and my first reaction to it was just hysterical laughter
1:56 NNNNGAHHH!
the 3d character is basically the same minus the extended creator and horse
twerky.
4:24 Fun Fact: The Jobs In This Game Are Really Well Balanced So The People Who Screamed At You To Follow The Meta Are A Lil 🤡🤡🤡
WHERE IS TOMADACHI LIFE 2
I’ve done multiple play throughs of Miitopia (both Switch and 3DS). Even though the story is the exact same thing, with different characters, it feels completely brand new
I still question people didn't know who lum was like... im 15 and even I know who she is
1:47 is so funny 🤣 😂
I love this game so much!! Sadly my game card doesn't work anymore :')
The remix 10 at the end caught me off guard
Not sure if this is a controversial opinion, but I don’t really enjoy Miitopia. It’s not a bad game, I really like the story, the ability to create any mii you want, and the interactions you can have with characters. The battle system however is so boring, I hate how plain it is. You don’t have the ability to use the other characters or press any other buttons while fighting. For example, the South Park games, I love how in those games you don’t just mindlessly fight. You can heal your teammates and you have to actually think about what attack you use on which enemy depending on their weaknesses, armor, and abilities. I hate that when one of my teammates is running low on health and I have plenty of HP bananas but I’m unable to give it to them and have to waste a limited amount of sprinkles. And I don’t have to think when I battle at all, the most I do is heal myself or others. If an rpg gives me the option to not only auto battle but to speed up the process, it’s not interesting or fun. I want to continue the story but when all you do to progress is fight in that boring system I can only take it for an hour.
The Church is God’s Sacred Space  Back when the Old Testament stories were still being lived out, God designated sacred spaces for His people to meet with Him.  First, God planted a garden in Eden—a beautiful space in paradise for His prized creations. Next, the tabernacle was a portable space in the wilderness for the Israelites who’d been rescued from Egyptian slavery. Then, the temple was a permanent space in Jerusalem for the people of Israel.    In all instances, these were specially chosen places of worship, as well as tangible signs of God’s presence.   The Creator of everything that exists can’t be confined to a garden, a tent, or a building, but it was in those sacred spaces where heaven and earth could overlap.  Fun fact: Garden imagery is all over the decorative details of both the tabernacle and the temple: palm trees and pomegranates, water lilies and almond blossoms, lions and oxen, vibrant colors and precious metals. Such designs are meant to point back to the beginning—before things went wrong.  Because a holy God loves sinful people, we have a separation problem. That’s why priests were appointed as representatives—mediators for things like worship, sacrifices, and atonement. And though it worked for a while, it was only a temporary solution.  But when Jesus showed up, He not only fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies and temple purposes, but He also bridged the gap. No longer was there a need for a temple made of wood or stone, but of flesh and blood. No longer was there a need for endless sacrifices, because Jesus, the ultimate high priest, had provided the ultimate sacrifice—Himself. Finally, God’s Spirit could now dwell with and inside of His people, the new and improved “temple.”  That’s why Paul asked the Corinthians:  “Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭ESV‬‬  We serve a God who meets people where they are: in the garden, in the wilderness, in the temple, in themselves.   So if you’re a follower of Christ, remember: You are the place where His Spirit now dwells. You are the vessel in which He lives and moves and works and empowers. You are the place where heaven has crashed into earth,.,
The only thing I don’t like about this game…  Is Illness. Why Nintendo, why?! It’s so annoying when I’m trying to train my Miis in a certain order😓 But other than that, I love this game so much and have several different files on my Switch for different themes😊💝
you sold me on it as a oc artist lol
hey Scott Whitney from Animal crossing gave Sig a gift.  and Will Smith gave you a gift on Miitopia.
Warining the code dosint work
0:52  I think the reason there aren’t that many options for Mii characters nowadays is because Nintendo doesn’t think they have much potential. Sure characters from Miitopia would look great in a Smash Bros. setting, but I think Nintendo is slowly trying to steer away from Mii characters. They still see the popularity amongst the fans, but apart from them, I don’t think Nintendo thinks highly of them.
4:20 (nice) Miitopia meta? I can build an entire team of only cat classes and murder *EVERYONE IN MY PATH*
Name one other game where an old man, the Pringles guy, Shrek, and Bubsy the bobcat can team up to save the face of Fat Albert’s daughter, Luigi, after it was stolen by Dark lord Hamburger
I played the 3DS version and I like the options the horse adds. Sure, you CAN grind levels, but you could also get lucky and have your horse decide to help boost your damage
0:23 I hate how accurate that Wallace mii looks.
2:41 all fun and games until one Mii gives the other a present and someone who they’re on the edge of quarrel with pops up like this
Speaking as someone who DID play the original, the new one is worth the price even if you have, if only for the horse and mii editing. But also, this version introduces a second layer of postgame, albeit a small one, which was also worth it.
I played the 3ds version and they added a lot. On the 3ds version customization was much more limited, basically just miis were what it used. Mabye a slight bit of makeup but nothing compared to what the switch version has
The annoying thing about Tomodachi Life is that the UK version has half the number of apartments the American one does. It’s like they turned around and said “Yes you can have English accents, but in return we’re downgrading the hell out of the game.”
I still have no idea how some people seemly gets images like sans's face or anime eyes on their Miis
I have a question. Can someone make me a good Gordon Ramsey mii? I had one on my 2ds and I would like my stubborn chef back
I played miitopia on the DS and I just bought it for the switch recently and I gotta say I love it so much, that and tomadachi life (forgive me I never spell it right) there’s just something so fun about these games and the fact that it never takes itself seriously only adds onto the charm, it’s hilarious because I made the main cast my friends and all of the miis are getting jealous over one specific friend who I usually jokingly fight over in real life, so to see miitopia reflect that was both scary and fantastic  The ds never had this much customization, nor did it have the outings, and you already touched on the horse in the video, I can say the customization and outings are huge pluses in my eyes as it was kinda awkward recreating ocs or book / show characters in the ds with the limited amount of customization you were given for the miis, plus the outings are just really cute and charming and I can’t stop smiling during those scenes
SEEING THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY BECAUSE I FINALLY FOUND MY PEOPLE I CAN TALK ABOUT MIITOPIA WITH !
Meanwhile with my horse it's the opposite my horse lamp shade was obsessed with my OC red table in the first act. AND OBSESSED WITH GETTING CLOSE TO ALL MY MEMBERS. Yeah but chooses not to help when we're all about to die.
It was adorable I added my OCS into metopia and I have a gay couple (My username is office chair so I) (named the rest of them objects) Aqua stool died and then flashlight avenged him and then flashlight died and then aqua stool came back and tried to avenge him. IT WAS ADORABLE AND THE FUNNIEST THING EVER.
If they release a Tomodachi Life for Nintendo switch they better make me customization exactly like this or update it so you can actually just customize your mii characters like this. LIKE IT'S AMAZING AND A MILLION TIMES BETTER.
3:47 Flavio?
1:47 - Accurate showcase of your allies' AI.
I can’t find the vods :(
I used my dnd party for the party in this game
The funniest part about playing Miitopia is how every time you put a Mii in a role they somehow always end up fitting with what the role you put them as is.
The 3DS version was far superior as you could have random miis take part without requiring friendcodes. They'd just... Happen. And it was amazing.
I love having Mario, Waluigi, Spamton, and Sans fight Dimentio for some reason. with Luigi being the great sage of course.
Over 100000 hours on the 3ds version i loved the new version (not even done) And my main goal is to make it to new lumos The background…the background just gives me city vibes…the music (STAGE THEME IS BETTER) its just so good
This is the only game with Peter griffin in a maid suit as part of its content 10/10
Is it just me is does no one like goblin ham.
"if you have OCs and you wanna see them go on adventures, it's definitely worth it."  Me with like 50 OCs: Brb buying a Switch
What do u mean mitosis with a bit of salt? It’s already got enough salt when it continues to make you re-choose your talent and u lose all ur friends 😔
I played the 3DS version like 3 times before it came out for Switch and it was definitely worth it playing again. The wigs and makeup weren’t a thing so you were limited to just mii stuff, even if it did let us use unnatural hair colors. My only disappointment is that they didn’t add new jobs, but that’s really only cuz of that one minigame question about a fake pirate job tbh. It’s a great game and I recommend it for people who’ve played the original 3DS version and newcomers ^^
Tbh, I never actually care what any of my Miis do in battle unless it's utterly 200% *nonsensical,* Ahey just do stuff and I'm like "ok" and I just win and stuff happens ¯\_,._.,_/¯
I personally like the 3ds better than the switch version. Maybe because that's the only one I have but still I prefer the original.
My party characters were my main mii, 3 ocs, 4 obscure anime characters my friend and a default mii. Plus another oc for the dark lord and saitama as the sage
When I first started playing, I was a massive Halo fan, and my tank was Master Chief, which led to my team's faces getting stomped in by a portrait of Master Chief. Trust me, the game is a masterpiece.
I wasted my money on robux when I could've bought this game🥲
i named my first squad Me and then ice cream flavors
I just made the most bullshit miis for every role Ah, yes, the sassy child, grandma Oh, and let’s not forget our sarcastic guy over here, susJe, and also our hero named Angy If you think any of that is funny, you are not ready for the actual miis
PEOPLE DON’T KNOW WHO LUM- LOOM- LIGHTBULB IS?! I never watched the show proper and I know her. Eh that’s fair, old show and all.  (By the way I said lightbulb because I forgot how it was pronounced and when I said Loom it made me think of lumens for lightbulbs. I think it’s funny.)

I played and loved the 3DS version, and when the Switch version came out, it was like playing for the first time all over again. I really love all the things they added and all the additions to character customization. I'm hungry for DLC and Miitopia 2 honestly.
I still just have th he Demo and I'm trying to make my entire cast of Miis based on only of my favorite franchises. The problem is I seem to be the ONLY one making characters from my favorite franchise lol
This was the first game on my 2ds.
I’ve played miitopia 3-ds and I loved it because it’d put people I genuinely knew in it, but then on switch I just added my favorite video game characters..
“Just do your sweep on all the low Hp Enemies and we can beat thing in one turn!” “Mp candy?” “Wha- No! Sweep.” Im already eating it.” “OH COME ON.” “This trap will keep me safe.” “RRRRAAAAGGHH!”
This should be a side of sugar
I only have the 3Ds version, and OH MY GOD I REALLY WANT THE SWITCH VERSION 😩  It’s so cool! Outings are new, the horse is new, customisation is obviously CRAZY and it overall just looks a little better since there’s a bigger screen for the little details. I really hope I can get it soon, but for now i’m playing miitopia on my little 3Ds. :)
The “I wish I could control my miis” is so true. Me: c’mon octo girl just use righteous anger. octo girl: hmmm… MY HEALTH IS ONLY 34/35, HP BANANA NEEDED
Yeah this video is pretty useless to me in terms of a review, cause I got the 3DS version (completed all the main challenges in that version), and got the switch version as soon as I could. I'm just here to listen to someone sing the praises if Miitopia.
1:22 I love this
It's been most of a year, and this still makes me smile.
The 3ds title was a major part of my childhood. I reset and replayed that game more times than I can remember. When the port came out, I started overplaying that too. To this day, I’m still replaying it.
Okay, I didnt really care about the switch remake seeing as I was content with the 3ds version, BUT THEY GOT YELLOW ALLOY ON THAT MFER? MY WALLET SIR, TAKE IT.
I sear to fucking god this is the most anime shit ever. Sooooo two of my party members had just reached the 24 attracted freindship level and then the same nigth my party gets reset and my character has to go save them from dark lord bowser and save there loved one. (And the other two i guess)
1:32 is hilarious
Ah yes, miitopia. The game where you can fight alongside Pikachu the mage, Shrek the singer and Markiplier the chef against a slime with the face of Albert Einstein which was stolen by Dream
wii play mii wii play mii
actually I like salt more than sugar. I really like your video!
I have the 3ds version. I’ve been playing through a file recently on it. I watched through a guy’s playlist of it about a month ago (on the Switch) so I am aware of the face stuff, wigs, horse, etc. that aren’t in the 3DS version. But it’s a remastered version; it isn’t gonna be the exact same.
It would be nice if you had a channel for twitch streams as it would be neat to see it.
after learning about his first anime crush, I finally found out where his outro dance is from
I’ve played both versions of Miitopia, and I honestly believe that the Switch version truly is worth it. Also CC.
Man, I would do anything for a Tomodachi Life sequel to be announced. I adore that game and I MISS miis being important to games. Miitopia was a breath of fresh air for sure
1:50 just my team
I've played the 3ds version like 10 times I love it
It’s just tomotadchi life meets,a character creation game,meets an rpg,meets a Gacha/gambling addiction,meets a dating sim
my face in miitopia that makes me look like a crazy....bloodhound......cccccrreaaatureee.....yeah...    (OK THATS ENOUGH DESCRIPTIONS)
my face in miitopia that makes me look like a crazy....bloodhound......cccccrreaaatureee.....yeah...    (OK THATS ENOUGH DESCRIPTIONS)
"Miitopia is a fanfiction writer disguised as a character creator disguised as a video game"  That's gotta be one of the greatest things Ive ever heard
I put the twitter logo on the genie’s face
I played miitopia for 3ds but I only played the demo cus I couldn't get the full version. I played it over and over and over  again and now I know the entire script for the 3ds demo dialogue. Yep. I did that.
2:42 This was my exact reaction, my party is made of Me, Mona, Plague Knight and Luigi. For context, in Shovel Knight, Mona and Plague Knight are like, soulmates, the chemistry (or better, alchemy) between them is insane. Mona is my waifu, and when I was developing my relationship with Plague this happened: "Mona likes Erick and saw it all" "Mona is jealous of Plague Kni."  And I started laughing
My sister erased my data…  TWICE
Wait deadass, how the fuck do I swap them around cause I forgot to give the knights faces and everyone but then has faces 1:26
okay so I'm not the only with scarily accurate miitopia cast. good to know!
Access code not working?  Edit: it was a "D" xd
My first squad was me as a laid back thief, Mina Ashido (MHA) the energetic pop star, Anji (Guilty Gear) the cool knight, and Shantae the kind chef
Ware the colde for you’re charriters
I put my dark lord as dio branddino
loving dat samus suit
Yo, that Lum Mii is adorable!
Me, an OC maker when this came out: This will be glorious... Me, after the first playthrough: Did I seriously ship my mage self-insert with another of my OCs? Me after playthrough 2: I cast Emperor Belos as the Great Sage. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!
Have a character be jesus it is very funny
There are several missing stuff in the 3ds compare to this cause they probably added them for example the horse.
It seem that your old anime crush is coming back
i remembered playing this on one of my old 3ds (i think that was what is was) nd i had to play it again and i am not disappointed that game is so much more fun than i remember XD
I played (maybe worshipped😅) the 3ds version and it was still WORTH IT. I will forever love Miitopia.
Correction: The encounters arent random, they are specified. Each location would have an encounter set in the specific path (Some spawns are repetitive than most). This is why the Sky Scraper and the Otherworld have farming locations
Huh. The first footage I saw was of someone hatting the game. So to see mr "With a side of salt" give nothing but praise is .... shocking to say the least. But not unwelcome.
the adventurer's guild miis can sometimes be way too on the mark, like one time I got a sans mii that was a punster mage. i wish i was making this up, and i swear this game is more aware than we think sometimes
I do really like Miitopia but (in the 3DS version at least) I just could not get over this stupid thing of the game taking away your party members, erases your class and put's you back to level 1. I get being able to journey with a lot of different characters but I never really got the feeling "oh yeah world 2 baby" it was always just "world 1 again" Not to mention how stupid it is when you base your character around a Physical Attack Class by giving them the right food, then have to pick another class and just so happen to pick a Magic related class since the game doesn't reset your food gained stat boosts. Constantly making you change your party members also means grinding later on to get those friendship perks you still wanted or grind in the beginning and both of those are pretty annoying imo It's a fun game but this one gimic never let me actually finish it
Nobody: My miis after losing 1 MP:  GIV MP CANDY
Imagine for a sequel of tomodachi life you can customize and place furnitures I. The miis rooms
I’m gonna go make oc’s now
4:32 Does anyone know the sauce?
I played both versions of the game and loved them both so I am glad someone can agree that it is a good and charming game
i should buy this game
I didn’t want this game before cause I already had the 3ds one and now I want this I didn’t realize how much cuter it looked on switchhh
as someone who has played the 3ds version, heres my opinion: the switch version is ten times easier, which is kind of sad. but, i like all of the new features they added and hey, if i want to go to something harder, i can always just play the original. overall, i completely agree that its a wonderful game and everyone who hasnt played it isnt living properly /j
Nothing's more awkward than making a multi eyed character only to have their eye count drop whenever they emote.
Lum is good civ
Tomodachi Life sequel is due more than Pikmin 4
The person who played the 3DS title and beat the main story aka beating the nova then I just had no motivation and just left but it has evolved really well
As someone who has both the Switch and 3DS versions, I can say Switch version is SO much better The Switch version’s graphics are absolutely AMAZING compared to the 3DS’ And because the upgraded character creator is exclusive to the Switch version, the 3DS version’s customization seems kinda… meh. But there are drawbacks. Primarily the Graphics. There is one specific enemy that I really didn’t want to see in 1080p. I think y’all know which one I’m talking about. Also, the Dual Screens on the 3DS. They’re horrible compared to the Switch’s, but… I feel like the Dual Screens actually made sense for an RPG. In the DS version, the bottom screen showed all your stats and options, while the top screen was reserved for actual gameplay. Felt like things were pretty cleaned up in that version. The Switch version has everything on one screen. The higher resolution makes up for this, of course, but still. Both versions are still wonderful, but both have pros and cons. And by that I mean the Switch version is better in every way except for the dual screens situation, which is a matter of opinion so it only really half counts. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk (-Bread) (Edit: -Pale King)
1:55 is that vyond/goanimate Ivy voice?
For some reason, the 3ds version didn’t use the 3ds's mii maker for creating from scratch. The switch uses the switch's mii maker for creating from scratch
I hold the switch in my hands. The switch isn’t purely a home console. It's both a home console and a handheld. I prefer handheld mode
Where’s da salt? I found this game SUPER repetitive and it got boring fast. How has nobody mentioned the lack of new features being added throughout the game?
I had the 3ds version and still got the switch one
I use to play the 3DS one and had a blast! I literally had every character as Temmie from Undertale, with the Great Sage as Bob! Funnest time of my life!
sig, like from puyo puyo
So.. I had wanted to have this mii I made named ‘Walter’, but didn’t know when I was prompted to make my party members. So I just made just about everyone in the game Walter. Seriously. The entire royal family was Walter. EVERYBODY WAS WALTER.
Miitopia is unironically one of my favorite games
I made CC the Genie in my game
I almost done with it
luv this 5:16
I’ve played Og
i like 1:47
my only problem with Miitopia is that it is to easy. i beat the final boss in just 2 turns, and the hands were much harder to kill
I think I have an old version cus I don't remember a horse in the game lol it any of the animations
TFW you love creating characters, but have no skill in showing how they look. T~T
I love this game to bits and the dialogue as well as the soundstrack and story is why.  No joke, the dialogue came incredibly close to “this is exactly how I talk irl” territory.
i just bought the game and i love it. also i made rhett and link and i made them have kawaii faces and made link like pink and gave rhett dresses
i played the 3ds version and u want to know if the switch one has new lumos and the dark sun
"Flesh horse demands sacrifice... Like and su- " Wait, those are not my thoughts...
My chef is gordon ramsey :D
The only real differences from 3ds to switch are the additions such as the horse or outings and the new character creation system (aka extra liberty with the mii’s visual aspects)
Let me tell you, I spent a whole 10 days trying to re-create all 100 stock Miis from Wii sports / Resort / and Wii party…   And then port those Miis from my Wii to my 3ds, and eventually Switch.  Then when I got the game it only took me 3 days to beat it.  Oh well, at least I have them for Tomodachi life (and whatever’s left of Miitopia)  ((And whatever other games that use Miis in them))
I played my 3DS copy and for my first team:  Me, a mii called RexDex, Johnathan joestar, speedwagon  Team two: Me, stan, friend, mom  Team three:  Me, OwO, Matt, dad  My current team: me, little bro, mom, dad
As someone who played both the 3ds version and switch version, I freaking love this game
Post-game does get boring after a while due to it being fetch quests in the first part but its a fun game.
1:56 ''GNNNAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!'''
Is there any way for us to view the Miitopia streams now?
i dont wanna be this person but,,, 5:12 song???
4:34   Who dat?
There are two amazing parts for miitopia: mii creation and the music
I played this game on the 3ds and let me say it was just as fun the second time when I grabbed the switch port. my party ended up danganronpa and yttd characters plus myself so it really was my own crack ship where I can hang out with kokichi and sou hiyori while riding a horse, I've actually been getting back into tomodachi life with an emulater and these mii games really have to come back in fashion because they're just so fun
Are you still guarding the door Squidward?
where can i find his miitopia videos ?
1:35 Well in the 3DS version, You could control the rest of your Party By using the 3DS' Mic
I’ve played the 3DS version, but I don’t have the Switch version, and I can say that the 3DS version has no Horse, and it also has the character creator limited to the normal MII creator with some extra colors you can have for some things. 😔
I had the 3ds version wich didnt allow the "makeup" and the better hairs and stuff but I did enjoy it ( mostly because I would only put either : Anime characters, My friends or Undertale characters and I was a bored 8 year old lol )
I'm shooting to get every medal in the game, I enjoy Miitopia so much and amount of plot is astounding
I have the 3DS version, and I love it so much. The music is incredible, the story is actually good, and the game is incredibly fun! I don't know if the Switch version is better in any way, but I still like the game.
I turned my entire cast into Palicos and it basicly turned into MH: Palico Stories!
That's great and all, but can you put in your fursonas?  Edit:  Yes.  Yes you can. This game better not have any scenes with a bike pump.
I started playing this game right as I started making my first own comic and gotta say this game is sorcery and it always figures out how to make my characters act in character.. Sorcery!
Yo I actually put my two favorite Castlevania characters while playing miitopia and somehow I made Dracula the wingman for me to get his own son😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
I have the 3ds miitopia only
Not a remake but a port with adds. "But the horse is new!"
Glad to know that I’m not the only one who thinks the Snurp battle song is amazing
looks like a cool and fun game :D
Great now I gotta play Miitopia.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH!!!!" -  scottfalco 2021
I made my horse into a demon and named him satan
The 3DS was just as great but didn’t have the horse or as many customization options
Hey did anyone save the vods? I just found this channel and I really want to watch this playthrough of the game
For me, I chose to play Miitopia to put my OCs in, but in doing so I accidentally created another OC while playing. No regrets!!
My wife played the 3ds title and made exactly 1 character randomized, with random letters as their name.   It was the evil genie character.  In order to beat the evil genie, you have to defeat him in battle and then "say his name to trap him in his lamp" by typing it in. If you get his name wrong, you are forced to run away and try again later.  This was the first and only time this ever came up, but she didn't want to take any more chances.
Every character in my playthrough was an OC i had made on the spot, including the player character, all party members and NPCs. The only non-original characters were great sage Matt from Wii sports, and the dark lord who was literally just me. This freaking game made me fall in love with characters i had created like a week earlier, then laugh my ass off at every one of their interactions. I don't even like RPGs and this is still one of my favorite videogames of all time, it's genuinely incredible.
CC accidentally cucking someone else is hilarious.
Kiryu-chan ~!
DARK LORD YANDEV BWAHA
This is so different because I finished watching your Hollow Knight gun video.
i played miitopia switch and 3ds, theyre both good Nintendo need to make a bigger mii game, mixing miitopia and tomodachi life almost like a Sims-like game
I played the OG on the 3DS and the remake easily beats it with all the improvments made and updates to the graphics. The horses, and hangout events weren’t a thing before and they’re incredibly welcomed haha.
"If you have ocs and you wanna see them go on adventures" legit made me think. I have them and i love the game but now im thinking about whether or not id like it if i didnt have ocs.
The first time I met the king and had to make his mii, I assumed he would be the stereotypical obease man and somehow made the perfect face for him
Here is a tip: if you encounter a fiend KILL IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN THE FIEND WILL ONE SHOT YOU
In the original 3ds version, I played the demo and grinded so much, that the 1st 4 party members got to at least level 20, and got over 1500 faces saved.
Cool
I always saw Miitopia as more of a hidden gem on the 3ds, because it came out, after the switch had been released l
I love that Miitopia is apparently the only game that nobody hates
I bought the game in june 2017 in 3DS for my 10th birthday and it was just great, i enjoyed playing it in my last years of being a kid and i really love it, i like the new version so much better and i am close to saving all my party members! I beat the game in 3DS a few years ago, i cant wait to finish it in the switch.
Boyfriend from Friday Night Funkin. I just had to, the Pop Star job was perfect.
Miitopia switch version is much easier than the 3ds version Nintendo should add a hard mode for more experienced players

My oc sold her soul and became an imp today 😅
I played this game and made the Dark Lord Guy Fieri.
Real talk: why is the final boss so easy?
the only issue I have with this port is the removal of randomized miis in towns. Like yeah I know I would go through and change some to either prevent doubles or remove characters  I absolutely hated sometimes, but honestly it loses a bit of that funny shock when I walk into a castle and don't see Brock, Han solo, Ganondorf, and Shrek guarding it.
this video in a nutshell: this game gud now play
Lol
During my first play...I messed it up by making every single party member look the same.
I played the 3ds title and I can say that this one is way better with the addition of the horse
I played Miitopia on the 3DS and it was practically the same thing, but worse graphics and the only new customizations was unnaturally colored hair. I really want it on the switch because of the new story and shit but my dad says "you already have it on your 3DS" but I already beat it and I dont want to delete my saved date from forever ago.              *wait does this mean I can make deltarune characters*
Why do the support class always like globin ham but not the classes that do the damage and Also I can not seem to find his stream am I missing something.
Where is cc from
Imagine all Switch Games had the Miitopia Mii Editor
As someone who played the 3DS version religiously, I can certainly say it's both better AND worse than the Switch port. My only real concern is the lack of touchscreen; I feel the second screen really added on to the whole experience as a whole and somewhat miss it. That's the only gripe I actually have, though.
I put the characters I made with my funny little stories that I share with my friends into this game and it was a great time
Lol
This just seems like “Miitopia with little to no salt” Also just so you know, the original Miitopia didn’t have the character customizer. Still were some good characters.
I beat Miitopia
Lum was your first waifu?  MY GUUUUYYYYYYY YESSSSSSS
Dark lord Kirby and the mayor is BIG CHUNGUS
PRINCESS PURAH IS LEGENDARY
I wonder if they will let it improve and update it. I don’t like how there isn’t like a market to buy the foods at least foods you’ve already found and stuff
Where is the salt
Ayy who played on the 3DS?
anyone else had miitopia on the 3DS?
Plz give us CC's access code
1:56 he’s having a seizure
Is it even possible not to laugh at least one time playing miitopia?
I finished the main quest line.. so now I'm slamming Lumos into dust, trying to get all foods, and weapons and armor and basically 100%ing it. I enjoyed the game.. and like ScottFalco, never played this on the previous consoles so it's new to me, and fun.
My question is how do you play it the worng way
Remember the mii games on the 3ds, like the small 5 dollar ones? Ah that was amazing, I enjoyed that a lot
CC is the theif in everybody's party, never using the right attacks
Upload the vods to your miitopia streams curse you
Where are these streams
I put some of my ocs as my teammates  after my beloved dissapeared. Id have to admit making miis are fun :)
Chad C.C.
I love seeing sig and tessa in this!
I made my first round of team based on the mii fighters from Smash. Then I went with characters who fot the roles well, like Brock as a Chef. This game has so much charm to it.
Miitopia with a grain of salt?
The demo is super long. If anyones on the fence still, go try it out 🌠
This port from 3ds to Nintendo switch actually adds a decent amount of new content!
The "who that?" Hiitted hard.
that thumbnail is so good
Also, this game is a welcome addition on the switch. Especially as my 3DS’ Circlepad was slowly wearing the rubber off, so I needed a port or two of my fav 3DS titles XP Even MORE so, because I can create AS MANY PLAYTHROUGH AS I WANT THANKS TO THE USER FEATURE ON SWITCH! That was my one issue with the 3DS version, is that the save file was relegated to the game cart, not the systems own memory. So having this, plus a few neat extras to make the game more enjoyable, is great~ Plus, I still have fun playing this game even though I played it once before~
Btw, the 3DS version was completely fine, and in fact…. It plays basically exactly the same as this version, but it’s more harder due to not having the horse, as that thing helps out quite a bit
wait, you can have someone other than goofy as the thief?
Dark Lord *Mickey Mouse*
and there's what RTgame did in Miitopia
I loved the 3DS one, and the switch port made me so happy
As soon as I get miitopia I will literally make my party just kel from omori
The flesh horse looks like it's made out of clay.
God i hope they recreate tomodachi life and have the same character creator and let you import your miitopia miis to tomodachi life
I gotta know... what exactly is CC?
sweet sweet NaCl~ Thanks
EL CHAPULIN COLORADO?! 0:22
I’m gonna pick this game up thanks to this vid
5:13  _T H E_  _E N D_  _I S_  *_N E I G H_*
this game is fucking hilarious
The price of ports can be super frustrating on release (especially in Canada, 80 bucks to buy skyward sword?!) but I’ll still never complain about getting them. I didn’t own a WiiU or a 3DS so I missed some real bangers. Happy to buy them when they drop in price, happy that people who never got the chance are able to play good games. If you’re not a multi-generational console buyer, not really a downside to ports imo
I have made so many abominations with mii faces and this is the game that gave them a purpose.
dark lord yandev just like in real life

I rly want a switch version of tomodachi life. Like just imagine it with the new character creator
"Is Sig getting cucked by C.C?" There's something i never thought i'd hear
What if, us viewers are the side of salt
5:13 i can see sephiroth hugging the demon
4:33 Someone please tell me what this anime is called, I saw the intro on YouTube and can not find it now.
Tbh I was really excited for this game when it was announced but I haven't gotten around to it because I decided "welp time to play all the routes of *fire emblem fates*". If I do end up buying the game, hopefully I'll be able to pay attention long enough to make my miis designed well so then my OCs aren't just basic bitch miis.
I've seen fucking crazy dave avatars
My second save on another account has demise from ss as the dark lord, link Zelda ganondorf and sheik from oot as my team members.   And random Zelda characters as the random townsfolk  And then there’s my tomodachi life where my miis are all real life people
It was simple, but the clip right before the credits had me in stitches. Completely unexpected.
if the game was deeper I would have bought it, as I woul dhave just liked the creation system. But I'm not paying full price just to use that.
it IS kinda scary when you put random characters from games and stuff in miitopia and the things the miis do make sense to the personality of the character or etc.
So a horse golem. You made a horse golem.
1:46 and beyond is just amazing
is there a game? I thought it was just a mii customizer
The ost for this game is so good, you really don't expect that many bops in a Mii game
i made my dark lord a duck and i can’t take them seriously anymore
Oh lord, I’ve never seen gameplay of the switch version. It looks SO much different from the 3DS version, to the point where I might start my 7th (no joke) playthrough again but on the switch version!  God this video brang back many memories of playing this game, and having my miis act in character WAY to well. Getting yelled at by others for using a flower as my healer (because it’s the best healer and nobody can tell me otherwise). From never using hp nanners and mp candies because sprinkles are better in every way.
I thought the video was the intro and i went like: wait wheres the video now?
Miitopia and The Zoo game are OK but they will be traded for Mario kart circuit Luiji and Mario cars😌
I'm so mad that I finished watching someone play miitopia, and only a month later, it was announced.
As someone who still plays original miitopia, this is a great improvement that somewhat warrants the price
Yeah... They should make an update to able customization for Mii's reactions/emotes...
Memetopia
Yandere Dev lmfao
Scott are you 50? How was Lum your first waifu?
My big annoyance with the game is when it kidnapps your party members and seals away your class, and then you are forced to play a different class and add new party members.  I like the warrior, it's my favorite class. And no new classes they add are as enjoyable as the warrior to me, so why the heck does the game lock away that class for so much of the game?! Like I kinda get the logic behind it, I do. Every world is designed for a level 1 character, so if they allowed you to keep your level 10 fighter class from the previous world it would make things easy. But like seriously, who comes to Miitopia for the challenge? And fine let's say you are here for the challenge, have the next world start with level 10 monsters and each new party member that is added has the appropriate level.  Also the kidnapping of party members at the end of each world? Even more annoying! This game advertises itself with "Make your mii's go on a adventure together", so locking away former party members just ruins the fun for me. Like I obviously favor certain of my Mii's, like the Mii of my best friend or Girlfriend. I would like to be able to have them throughout my journey. But them being taken away on the first oppurtunity? Not a fan. When they both got taken away I was less motivated to play through the game to get them back, it's the Skyward Sword problem all over again!   (I liked Zelda in that game so much, and hated how little she was in the game and how basically it uses Zelda as a dangling carrot over your head to get you through the story. Just play a bit more and maybe you get to interact with Zelda a bit more! Yeah no, I would much rather have preffered to take this journey with Zelda rather than constantly trying to get to her so that I hopefully get a few cutscenes with Zelda in them.)
Anyone tried having Spyro characters in Miitopia? Or even Malefor from the Legend trilogy. The Dark Master as the Dark Lord xD
I have the old 3ds game but I’m saving up to get a switch as I’ve reached the end game and have gotten to the extra levels. Can’t wit to see the differences.
Mp Candy?
One of my favourite moments in the 3ds version was  Rei ayanami and Obama talking about air....
Meanwhile i have to play Tomodachi collection cause my 3ds was stolen and my phone is Crap cause it can't handle Citra.
Miitopia is hands down, most underrated game out there. Gameplay is fantastic. It could be a story about you, and your friend Freddy Fazbear, taking on the Dark Lord, Jimmy Neutron. Or maybe you and Shrek go on a date! This game has great humor, gameplay, story, and my favorite part, the amazing soundtrack! Right off when you start the game you are greeted with this gorgeous Greenhorne battle music, and there are almost 200 (300?) soundtracks in the game! My personal favorites are Greenhorne - Battle, Peculia - Battle, Glados Isles - Battle, Greenhorne - Stage, New Lumos - Stage, and there’s too many too name! I wish more people would get to know Miitopia! It’s probably number five on my top ten favorite games! The game is so long too! Miitopia has so many fun events that in only the main story, me and my sister took a whopping 875 screenshots!  Spoilers below:  Think you beat the Dark Lord, Waluigi once and for all? Nope his spirit flew out and possessed the Great Sage Pog Face! Guess what? You’re only halfway done with the story, and not even close to completing the entire game!   (End of spoilers) Theres so much story! If you haven’t played, I totally recommend you do. It’s only 50 bucks while a regular Switch game is 60! If you can’t afford it, the demo goes on so long too! GET THIS GAME! THERE’S SO MUCH TO DO!!!
When I had to name my dark lord back when I was like, 9, I just spammed letters. So I'm keeping that tradition alive by naming my dark lord "ppsjdisjdysjy"
I'm so happy they remade Miitopia for switch and added a bunch of new stuff. I just hope they do the same for Tomodachi Life at some point... I'd love this level of customization in that game!
Someone who actually puts their own characters into the game instead of just using memes? WHAT HERESY IS THIS?!?! Okay but for real that was honestly the best part for me. Reviving my oldest OCs, making new ones, and even making ones that weren't human. It's easily the best part of the game.
One time one of my Miis saw statues of Ganondorf, Link, and Zelda. The TriForce was assembled
It would be cool if you could choose traits. Like for Urbosa, she wouldn’t refuse healing but there are a few things that stubborn fits.
I hate when they waste snacks! Especially when the next attack will deal way more damage than they heal. I wasted 35 hours on the demo and got 3 under max sprinkles so got that very fast in the game. But Link? He’s my most powerful character! He once dealt 999 damage! So it’s pretty annoying when he does it.
This video is 99% salt free! Wow
U played the 3ds version I made a bunch of Pokémon characters and thanos
I played the 3ds 1 and that switch 1 is beder
I’m going to call the Dark Lord, Leo, after my cat.  … Anyone who’s ever owned a cat will understand
I played the 3DS version, and the Switch version is a super big upgrade
Big question, what is a OC?
It's the perfect game for Twitter because you can make it as unnecessarily diverse as you want
Greenhorne: Me, Ghost (main protag of Hollow Knight), a dead meme (blue Ugandan Knuckles), and Hornet (also from HK) save an Among Us character along with others (like Bretta from HK) from Dark Lord Antimaster. (made-up Mii; messed with inverted colors when making him.)  Neksdor: Me, an oc named Prance, Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory, and Quirrel have multiple run-ins with Great Sage Radiance ( *spoiler alert:* the final boss of Hollow Knight) and Hoopa, Genie of the Lamp, who's face has been stolen.   me: Mage and then Imp Ghost: Warrior blue dawae (the dead meme's name): Cleric Hornt (her name in Miitopia): Thief  Prance: Cat Dexter: Scientist Quirrl (his name in Miitopia): Warrior
I played the original and had even more fun with this
El Chaplin Colorado ahh I’m so happy
Chat be krumping with Scott.
Fan service: the RPG
All this, and no mention of... The TWERKY...
My bro had this game for the Ds and was addicted
2:45 this is america, you think he is just gonna stand there? noooo, he will freaking load a glock if the guys gotta
I played the 3ds version and I think the switch version is not only better but is worth it
Don't be afraid of your flesh horse buddy. He's great and any time he steps in, he makes the character he's helping unquestioningly better.
4:31 a man of culture🤝
Monster hunter rise twins
You make creative representations of miis. My princess only has  a mouth.
I wish Tomodachi Life 2 was made for the switch with more interactions and the same custom character thing or be able to port the miis in Miitopia to tomodachi life
As someone who played the 3DS title I'm still really enjoying the switch version   Obviously all the horse attacks are new to me but mostly it's kind of like reliving a really fun fever dream and changing the faces   Besides I've found new interests since then so having new characters is a lot of fun
I just had an army of Uganda knuckle
3:58 Bold of you to assume I get fanart
my team members are 2 of my cats, 3 ocs and a few zelda/splatoon characters
Tomodachi life for switch when?
Me coming back to my 2ds save a few years later with all my old pals in the game: who the hell are half these people?
Imagine not beating the actual final boss couldn't be me
I was one of the people who played the game on the 3DS and I’m mildly confused
Lonk from Pennsylvania.
1:56
The only problem I had with miitopia was that I got too attached to my first party and didn't put much care into my next party and just tried to get my first party back as soon as I could
Switch version looks cool but not many things changed so i am with 3DS version for now
Switch version looks cool but not many things changed
"Miitopia is easy"  Y-yeah... sure it is...   *cries in post-game*
The animation segment where he goes, "NAAAGHH-" I kept rewatching it.
No way, i've also named the dark lord Yandere Dev XD
WHAT IS THAT SONG WHEN PLAYED W THE HORSE AT THE END.
What’s you’re access key?      ❤️ ur miis
I might just get this and have the characters from a sitcom XD
That feel when you only have furry OCs
it was basically Christmas when nintendo announced this port
meat stallion
I played miitopia on the ds and it was really fun, the new game on the switch has completely different features and it was worth buying again
After this fun journey I think we all know what is truelly needed       *Sig needing a therapist for example*
Where is the salt? It was hidden. Or maybe...this game is just too sweet :D
why did this game get such good music though. like who at nintendo decided to give the funni mii game one of if not the best nintendo soundtrack
Imagine This kind of Face Maker into Smash Ultimate 😳
hhh i love this but i really really hate RPGs 😭 I just really want Tomodachi life 2 with this character creator and these graphics now
2:26 TINGLE, TINGLE, KOOMPHA! LIMPHA!
Dammit, now I wanna watch Scott playthrough all of Miitopia.
1:47 this is literally everybody in miitopia atleast once
My dark lord is named bad man, so they'd just say " We have to beat bad man, the dark lord!"
0:57. Ah, the Zero series. I see you're a man of culture as well.
normally i rate vids like but i had to rate this 1 DISLIKE
Making absurd Miis is fun, the actual game part though is incredibly boring
I still play the first game of Miitopia, from the 3DS version.  It is good but not quite as good as the Nintendo switch version, because you can do a lot  more creative things in the new version
I traded so many games to get the game on my 3DS. Ill always love how great it was. And all the sudden they made a new one?!?! Welp, weres my disks at
Please make a supercut of your Miitopia playthrough...
I played the 3DS version! All the way through! Post game used to be easier, we didn't have a horse, or wig and makeup stuff, all around was cool
I want to get the game and put Yuri on Ice characters in
Wait ... there’s a Miitopia team building meta? What is it? What is the supposed superior team?
1:46 this is very relatable not going to lie
One thing I like about the 3ds games compared to this version is that you didnt have to pay to use other characters from other people
i made a microwave with a face in miitopia with the makeup stuff
2:36 This fuckin’ kills me
Who else wants tomadachi life on switch
1:56 best angary sound
I got waaay to into having my characters bond because like....they're in love dammit, let them be married
Giving a like for the Lum highlight. Good vid too.
1:31 GRUNKLE!?!? STAAAAAAN!!!!!!! GRAVITY FALLS!!!!!!!!
Plot twist: the horse was not completely flesh it was pink-gold
"And that'd make the game even easier than it already is" *Laughs in tower of dread/despair*
There’s no meta, people are just weird
>After Dark Lord Yan Dev  Ah, a man of culture.
I made a mii called senpai (from friday night funkin) and the dialogue made so much sense for some extremely weird reason
My Miis: *Hates Goblin Ham*  Also My Miis: I’m so hungry I want some juicy goblin meat
Miitopia is an AMAZING game and when it got announced that it was getting a Switch port I was the happiest person in the WORLD! The amount of times I’ve laughed at this game is too much to count
YOO IS THAT RHYTHM HEAVEN MUSIC AT THE END
2:38 . The best part.
As a Persona 3 fan, I was ready for the not being able to control party members. I am superior to you all
personally, I made my 4 main miitopia characters be my pokemon oc and the sword and shield rivals.
Since I played the 3DS title I had to make the Great Sage/Mage have a really scary face since I knew what was going to happen 😭😭
Cc wack
I remember i saw someone make everyone kel and it was beatiful
oh my god I also made a flesh-horse lol
1:56 MiiScott.exe has stopped working   Close program                     Wait
I’ve played the 3DS version and the switch version is so much better
Did not expect this to make me laugh so much
I made a squad entirely out of original characters I came up with long before I heard of this game. When I finally played Miitopia, my OCs were *so in character!* I had at least 30 moments where I went "Bro that's so accurate!" Very good game.
Nintendo Ads: And the game would be even more hilarious if you use Miis of irl friends/family. Miitopia Community: *H e h e OCs*
BRUH NOW I WANT A SWITCH RATHER THAN MY DS!
why dont he put the part when you cure your miis with salt???
WHAT YANDEV AS THE DARK LORD ✋😭
they stacked an entire pack of crack into the soundtrack tho, the songs are bangers
I love Miitopia, I just wish there were more personality types, like slightly more negative ones. I mean, half my team is made up of bad guys from a game I'm making, so I wish I could have a "Vain", or "Egotistic" personality type.
Miitopia with a side of sugar
Just gonna say it, for anyone who has the demo and is planning to get the full game, I'd recommend planning you're cast of mii characters because you do not want to just be sitting there trying to decide who's gonna be who.   It might not be for everyone, but hey! Worth a shot!!
Miitopia is a beautiful conglomeration of randomness that happens to line up with your characters sometimes and it's just perfect.
I actually played the game for the DS first. It was fun then and is even more fun now
Hope I find it on sale. The demo was fun.  I have a few OC, but people making those Zero and Goemon just look near perfect.
Can someone tell me what this 3ds title is?
Seeing this just make me wish that more people would actually watch my Miitopia series that I’ve been uploading on YouTube
I love the Flesh Horse for... some reason.
I played the 3ds version, there was no horse, and the design system was basic, so you couldn’t do cool designs, and some of the interactions between characters weren’t in the game either. Basically this switch version is a better version.
miitopia 3ds was kinda trash. there were none of these fancy things, just battle, relations, and battle.
i played the 3ds title
I feel like people don’t talk about miitopia on the 3Ds
I’ve Started playing miitopia and other than OCs I just decided to put memes into it because why not. Memes like Gabe N the great sage, Dark lord Skeletor, and will smith the genie.
Dark Lord Yandev
Once, my teammate Rise, from Persona 4, talked about how dreamy the Great Sage, Yu Narukami is.  That’s oddly in character, since Rise has a massive crush on Yu in Persona 4.
Just do your sweep on all the low hp enemies and we can win this in one turn :D *MP candy?* Wh- NO SWEEP *im already eating it* OH COME ON *this trap will keep me safe* NYAAaAaAaA
What is the song at around 4:50?
Twerkey
A YouTuber named Kagato the Final Boss and in his latest Miitopia stream, he added Aketchi (Panketchi) to his team and he gifted something to his Mii of himself and it broke him. Seeing it live made me laugh so much that my sides started aching.
1:57 angy Bro he made yandreDev the villain how fitting
I absolutely loved the miitopia on DS when i was younger and (as I had no life) 100% the game.
As someone who played the ds version it is a massive improvement just imagine this game with no outings no horse and like the entire game in 16 bit the only flaw i see is the food system you see in the begining the only common attack boosting food in the first area is goblin ham but my dad (i put my family and friends because i didn't have my own characters plus i was like 5 or somthin) and he was a warrior but he hated goblin ham the only common attack food in greenhorne witch was really anoying and my mii was essentially invincible why because i didn't even bother with the system i just fed miis what they liked and my mii liked a lot of foods the boost hp so i just kept feeding him that a omg what how did i get so much hp
one time one of my miis in this game was  jealous of one mii that were dating so then the got the other mii ROSES like right after that
*Nintendo: Miitopia is a fun kid’s game where your miis go on adventures!*  **sees Twerkey**  *me:*
alright that's it, you're going to *horse prison*
I really want Tomodachi life on the Nintendo switch
flesh honse.
The horse I made at first was blue and yellow with demon eyes that would question your purity, but somehow now I find the horse to be kind of cute
After seeing your miis compared to mine, its just not fair xd
1:38 i agree lol
Mii Scott slowly dying inside for the whole game due to his allies not being smart in battles.
I got really sad when I lost my friends. :(
Because right now I'm stuck with only the demo, I made like 3 other accounts on my switch for me to play on. And on one of those accounts, I made the entire game me. All of greenhorne? Me. My entire party? Me. It was amazing. But then I beat the demo again and I was sad.
I feel old for Knowing that anime reference
*_Looks like the perfect game to finally pit some canon and/or original OCs and watch them do random things together while you get to go full RPG mode. Wish I had a Switch, but I can imagine how funny it gets with my characters..._*
When your a  thief and your about to do your sweep, But then SOMEBODY does PINCER!! UGH THE ANGER!
I gotta agree that Miitopia really puts your characters in scenarios they'd actually be in or say stuff they'd actually say, because I had my own mii as the main character and irl I have a real problem with secondhand embarrassment, and in-game my person once said the line "is it possible to die from secondhand embarrassment?" My jaw dropped when I read it because secondhand embarrassment was never spoken about for the rest of my playthrough. It was just too in-character that it caught me off guard lol There are more of these situations, but this one stood out for me the most.
Finally someone who appreciates Chef as the superior Job.
Does this mean Sog and Tessa will come back?
I played this when it first came out and I freaking loved it. Up until now, I’ve always been asking myself: “Are they going to remake it for switch?” But then one day I was scrolling through the Nintendo news, and I saw the announcement. I screeched, right next to my mom, and she was just like: “Wtf 🗿” BUT I DIDN’T REALLY CARE CAUSE I WAS SO HAPPY-
Honestly the simple concept of an RPG that just inevitably turns into Konosuba is amazing on its own and in that framing device not controlling your entire party makes more sense because it’s a silly game and perfect cohesion doesn’t make for good humor.
this is the happiest I have ever heard Scott sound about a gam and I live for it!
I have the burger king guy in mine and my other miis talk so much smack about him it’s so funny 😂
welcome to cc town
This is a good video to eat cereal to
Oh god another reason to get a switch
you convinced me to buy it, an thank you i do not regret it-
Here's part 3 of the list of characters I would have in my miitopia play through and their roles.  Pinkie pie: Dancing guide Rick from Rick and Morty: Rambling old man 19 dollar fortnite card: Shady merchant daughter EA Games: Shady merchant father Papyrus: Worried explorer Freddy Fazbear: Prickly husband Chica: Prickly wife Mangle: Desert celebrity Garfield: My first new party ally (a laid back cat) Sandy Cheeks: My 2nd new party ally (a cautious scientist) Kakyoin: My third new party ally (a cautious cleric) My second job will be mage Cuphead: My first final party member (an energetic tank) Millie: My second final party member ( a cool imp) And Chikn Nuggit : My third final party member (a kind flower)  My final job will be a princess
Here's part 2 of the list of characters I would have in a miitopia play through and their roles.  Isabelle: Nintendo fan Tails:Prodigious postman Baldi: Quizz master Markiplier: Roving photographer Wallace: Roaming gourmet Eggman: King Rouge: Princess  Shadow: Besmirched Noble's son Sonic: Prince from a nearby land Jotaro: Serious soldier Polnareff: Lax soldier Joseph Joestar: Royal support (right) Avdol: Royal support (Left) And Chris McLean: Genie of the lamp
I played it on 3ds and now it’s on Nintendo switch! I’m surprised.
Here's part 1 of the list of characters I would have in my Miitopia play through and what their roles are. Stanley Pines: Carefree tour guide Rapunzel: Cherry granny Eevee: Sassy child Sylveon: Worried mother Mickey mouse: Man of the lovey dovey couple Minnie mouse: Woman of the lovey dovey couple RED Spy from tf2: Sarcastic guy Homer Simpson: Dubious mayor The Coon: The Dark Lord Me: The main protagonist (an air headed warrior) Spongebob: My first ally (an energetic chief) Apple (from animal crossing): My second ally (a kind pop star) Waluigi: My third ally (a stubborn thief)  And Tom Nook: The great sage
start the game end with a fanfiction
I just made everyone me, god the minigames were hell
Remember when we used to make Darth Vader in the Wii’s Mii channel? Like holy shit I bet you could try it out nowadays with Miitopia, and actually have him look like the real thing.
Just saying, this game is my new favorite Nintendo game after BoTW and Mario Galaxy
1:56 your welcome
Everybody acts like this game wasn’t on the 3DS just because it didn’t have the complicated Mii maker back then
I played the 3DS title. It's very fun, but I think this remake is better, but I don't have a switch and the game is expensive for a remake. :/
Don't worry Mister Falco. I know who you're first crush is, that mermaid girl from Goemon.
It’ll be cool if they put Mii Maker in Smash Bros
I've watched this video 4 times now, help.
I added Kiara as a popstar and Calliope as a thief and obviously I maxed their friendship.  Update:I'm now hyperfixated on The Owl House. I'll f*cking do it again but with Lumity if I were to do a second playthrough
imagine trying to watch a video but then spiders
Fcott Salco is jealous
miitopia with a side of salt? more like miitopia with a side of holy shit this game is cool
When i saw miitopia back before. My dream was having it, and now it came true. I’ve already beaten 80% of postgame
can't wait to be able to afford this and make the character randomness way worse than i did on the 3ds version
Finally I get to ship myself with DaBaby 😍😍😍😍
"Sure I wish I could control everyone but that'd kind of make the game even easier than it is." Just you wait. It get's hard... mainly in the postgame but still.
At least these miis don't scare me. * Cautiously glances over at Failboat's "miis"
1:47 i know this all to well
734854th
i got the 3ds title and honestly i had no idea that there was a port for the switch until today
As someone who played the original on my cousins DS and loved it, I love the Switch version even more

HOLY CRAP THE SWITCH MIITOPIA LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER THEN THE ORIGINAL
A rather lethal combo I discovered yesterday. For this to work, you must be playing as a Cat and at least one of your teammates must be a Pop Star. The Pop Star must have already unlocked Encore and you must have unlocked both Cat's Paw and Sharpen Claws. OK, all set? Here's how you do it: 1. Wait for your Pop Star to target you with Encore. 2. Once they do, use your first turn to do Sharpen Claws.  3. On your next turn(which if you made yourself as fast as I did, should be the very next turn or at most one more turn after that one), use Cat's Paw on whatever absolutely needs to die...and then profit. Keep in mind, Sharpen Claws doesn't specifically forbid itself from being used on skills, so it counts for both your physical attacks and your skills! (Do mind your MP though.)
"If you like RPGs with character creation, get this RPG with character creation."
this sure is better than glitch city in cyberbugged 2020
great to see sig and tessa again. How i first discovered your channel was through that video and it sucks that you can't make more but the side of salts have been a great series too. :)
Me who has like 87 OCs: YES
as someone who played the 3DS version, I can confirm it's good. (i also enjoy the updates in the switch version too, and I'm happy the game is being more noticed and enjoyed by more people! :D
Ok but whens the next episode of sig and tessa?
When I buy this the warcry will be “for allah”
I'm honestly just glad everyone is playing this again.
Y'all ever make the dark lord dr.phil?
Miitopia is one of those games that draw you in, make you embrace the madness and then chugg along for the ride.  And it's wonderful, it's the perfect example of taking a stupid premise and just rolling with it.
“And eat candy?”
Konosuba the game
I LOVE being able to make my own OCs and the character creator is way easier than I expected. I'm a dirty furry for it's always been hard to make my characters in games with miis but now I can with the million different skin color options?? It's so fun-and like you said somehow they end up in super fitting scenarios.
1:28 is it just me... or are these two characters looking a bit “funky”
5:08 I really wish a single videogame was announced at E3
I wish Scott had a vod channel
I traded in 90% of my 3ds games to game stop to buy miitopia
I got the game only because of the music and I regret nothing
Is there anywhere I can go watch the old streams?
I'm so glad you loved it as well, Scott! It was so fun! I never thought I'd love a game about Miis but here we are.
I made my oc bond with Cynthia from pokemon. Life's good
I wished that Tomodachi Life had a sequel announcement at e3 as well. :(…
Nintendo Community having alot of Toxic Try-Hards?  oh no
Gotta love CC! ❤️🤣
1:31 Do my eyes deceive me or is that..l
As a person who played the 3DS Title, I was happy to see it brought to the Switch. I never finished the 3DS title, however since the Switch version brought new content, my goal will be to beat the game eventually.
I was legit surprised that about Lum from Urusei Yatsura and how people got confused about her. She was my first anime crush and that whole series was amazing.
Spoiler                     the dark lord becomes good at the end
It's like fanfics but... a game?
i would love to see a new tomadachi life game but with the customization miitopia has like not only would the game be nostalgic but also 100x times
*Insert comment on me waiting for Scott to reach the post game*
Miitopia. The game where you, Lucario, Geralt, and Sans can all team up to take down Dark Lord CEO of EA, Andrew Wilson.
i made the princess bob ross and i love it
I would looooooooove a port or sequel of tomodachi life on switch
I used to play miitopia on the 3ds and oh shit I have maxed everything there. I am one of the first players because i got it on the day it got released. i made peter griffin dark lorc
This game is actually rated M in Russia due to the fact you can be gay, true story
it wasnt
I played the 3ds version. I never finished it, but I did play it. And I had more fun with the switch port because of the added features and customisation options. Especially bc the interner went HAM with the character creator. Seeing my OCs do shenanigans is fun.
Time traveler: snaps a twig The timeline: 4:50
Apparently, the food system is basically "What facial features are on your Mii and what time they were created", meaning if you add the exact same Mii in, say, a different game, they'll keep their preferences.
did we all name our villains after pedophiles or assholes? he named his villain YandereDev and I named my villain EDPedo, please i literally thought of naming my villain YandereDev. 😭
0:22 heeey that's my sigma and ashe!!
1:47 that bit reminds me of konosuba and I love it
I named my horse “Big Lad” and afterwards I just started laughing at the name for almost 10 minutes
I make ocs up for my Miitopia games and I’ve done that as far back as the initial release for 3DS lol. This current set has probably churned out some of my favorites because of the new customization
Tomodatchi life is supposed to be coming out soon for the switch
The oc reason is the main reason I got Miitopia
Gave my dark lord the missing texture for a face. The headcanon being that he's stealing everyone's faces because he doesn't have one of his own.
Oh boy! My party is shaggy and Jesus! What a funny haha- ohhhh they’re in love now
Are you going to upload the Miitopia vids somewhere on YouTube ngl I dislike trying to watch the vids on twitch with an ADs constantly popping up.. ☹️
I've played both versions and the Switch version feels like a big upgrade!
I need to know what happens to Sig??
I got pretty far into the 3ds version. At the minute I don’t plan on playing the switch port
I'm sad that most of his Miis are locked I wanted to have zero lol
Miitopia meta LMAO, ew, fun detected, must... follow... meta... Beep boop the terminators of fun have arrived
Sir, you have sold me on this. My ocs are gonna go on some whack adventures. Thank you!
Scottfalco: "...and see plenty of 'who dats?"" Lum: "Darling no BAKA!!"
I overleveled my mii’s before the final fight and one shot the final boss with horse wispering imp
as a guy that has like 40 OCs it's very nice to be able to make them in a character creator and have them go on an adventure and it's for that exact reason it kinda eats shit that there is a big assed turkey that farts on you in the same game
I’m so tempted to get this game purely to bring my OCs to life and to force my anime crushes to fall in love with my character lmfao
wanna know something funny? I BOUGHT THE ORIGINAL FUCKING MIITOPIA ON THE 3DS AND NOT A MONTH LATER THIS RELEASES.... GODDAMNIT
If they add this to tomadachi life it’s gonna be so amazing imagine them adding a clothing creator too you can make characters exactly how you want and the randomness is so funny
ScottFalco's Bizarre Adventure.  Seriously tho this makes me wanna get it.  I'd say my first video game waifu (Asellus) would confuse people even more than Lum but with the remake out that probably will no longer be the case. :p
Nice first anime girl crush. I recognized her instantly. Personally I am more of a Elle De Rosenbach sort of guy, but Lum is good too.
“Dark lord YanDev”  Should’ve named the sage “Scott Cawthon.
0:57  i finally found a Megaman Zero reference
It's all fun and games until you have to start your horse relationship from ground zero
Only problem to me was losing my party members and job after every world make me want to change classes and party members don’t force that shit on me  Also I don’t buy the Nintendo online service so I just had default miis but isn’t really a fault on the game
My Lum!!! R1R37Y
while there is a meta that exist.. its not that much effective as one may think almost every combo is viable just dont bother going full healing team
having the villain be yandev is very appropriate
CC? Like from Code Geass?
MMZ Zero really caught me off guard there at 0:57. I'm used to always seeing MMX Zero.
3:04 "I've gotten a KoNoSuBa vibe."  That is LITERALLY ALL you had to tell me to get my money.
Imagine if the people at nintendo were just testing out the mii creator and then add it later, that’d be amazing, but I don’t think that’s gonna happen
I wanna buy this game and make the cast of family guy
About you hoping for a tomodachi life remake, I hope they add same sex relationships
Okay I'm gonna get it... after ring fit adventure I am out of shape.
I think my favorite thing was I made my party completely normal, but I made all the side characters bizarre and weird. Lemme tell you, there were some scenes that I literally lost my mind at
We’ll time to make a SlaveKnightGael
Maybe I should give Miitopia a try.
'the game knows" - sun tsoo
So wait were you a chef or a knight I got confused
I remember seeing a let's play of the 3ds version and really got bummed when your party gets kidnapped so you have to get a new one - RubberRoss's wife, who likes the birds, or anyway someone associated with game grumps
if you get high enough with a horse. DAMN does it become completely overpowered
A few days after I completed the ds version a switch version came out?    REALLY?!
MP candy bit 1:47 you're welcome.
"easier than it already is" - said by someone who has obviously never gone to the city
Ya I played miitopia for the 3ds and can't wait to get it for switch but I never played tomadachi life and I'd love too
What is CC in your channel?? Confused lol.
I love Miitopia and I'm glad people are finally playing it!
It it Basically single player D&D. Love it!
The music is banging and I love my mii OC's because they look like cute anime OC's😂😭😭
4:32 *good choice*
The music absolutely slaps, like way harder than it should
This youtuber's job is to cry
I named my dark lord Sus inspired by "when the impostor is sus." Needless to say, whenever a character said his full title, I couldn't hold a straight face thanks to Dark Lord Sus.
Question? I took it seriously. I loved realizing my 10 OCs (All of which are from different countries) too much to ruin any part of the world around them with other people’s memey monstrosities.
All my miitopia is Peter Griffin
2:41 why does this sound so familiar? … OH CRAP SEPHIROTH?
I cant unsee the fat king as majima because of shen, please help me.
*Cries in Miitopia Casting Call & Demo*
SCOTT I SAW THE INTRO FOR THAT ONE ANIME AND YOU USED THE SAME DANCE lovely
it you like making the side of salt series then eat salt on ice cream with ketchup peper mustard and mayonaise yes i just said that
Brother and I built a new oc named roger, a middle aged chef. By world 2 he became a thief and turned to a life of crime after his friends samus, stink, and tabby slime were stolen, desperately trying to replace them with soomus, lonk, and yoshi only for them to be kidnapped too.  Roger is met by a scientist named harrison who makes roger's beaten and defeated self into a literal tank. This begins as Roger's redemption arc until the unsc sucks them into their ranks and practices imperialism by conquering the whole forest with an army of tanks. This is a very good game.
Bettle XD Its from breath of the wild XDDD
5:23 HEY WAIT A MINUTE YOU MISSED A CHANCE TO USE HP SPRINKLES
0:55 I see you also thought townsfolk are going to be your party and when actual party arrived you went "f**k it I'm not making another one"
I added Yosuke from Persona 4 and he acts so much like Yosuke from persona 4 that it scares me...
I literally only played the 3DS version and i looked at tjis at looks completely different
"If you have OCs and you wanna see them go on adventures" now you have my attention
1:34 fun fact! They aren’t random they happen in the same area best example is a cross path when both paths merges boom encounter
My respect.   Lum the invader girl.
The addition of the makeup and wig stuff really added so much to the ability to (re)create characters, original or otherwise. But I also appreciate the addition of the "default" cast of Miis. Plus the names I've seen in both US and EU localizations are pretty punny. My favorite were the US defaults for the Fab Fairies and their fans. Wanda and Juan, both similar to one. Tula and Toby, well kind of a stretch on Toby, but two. And Tula gets a bonus because of her boss battle, Arachnotula. Gets that bonus pun for being close to Tarantula. Then Tressa and Sanford. Tres is Spanish, and San is Japanese for three. There's definitely more, and the names for the defaults differ in different regions releases. It was nice to see, even though it's very likely they'll be overwritten with the huge amount of choices available to players.
As someone who has, and has beaten the 3ds version, it's mostly the same All thats different is the hd, the character creation, the menus being harder to navigate, and H O N S E.
Well can't wait to see someone shit on a game he probably still likes himself  Edit: wait a second this is less salty than usually...
WHERE IS MY SIDE OF SALT
>“My literal first anime crush” >shows Lum My boi Scott is a man of CULTURE!
Um I don’t want to go all Karen on ya but where’s my side of salt I’ve been robbed (jk)
When playing this I made 2 of my friends as party members, the rest were my own OCs. Haven't beaten the game but I enjoy it alot.
Are you interested in Game Builder Garage?
That palico mii is gonna give me nightmares
1:34 why does Tessa look like her armor is from AOT wtf
If you  made a short  scene compilation of moments of your playthrough I think I'd watch that and like it too if the stream archives are anything to go by. Haha. It was fun.
Lum best anime girl
1:46
is your mii supposed to look like that?
Concept side of sugar since this game is just at that correct amount of sweetness
fun fact: everyone on your party can actually get along when everyone its at 99 friendship level
GREAT SAGE GOEMON
aaaAAAA THE FLESH BEAST, IT STARES,
You do know this game is 30 hours long right?
Tomodachi life didn't even have a make up and wig editor but people still made some pretty amazing things!
The character creator is so good
I made the protagonists and the dark lord into the same guy. “You’ll never get away with this Dark Lord Lake!” “You underestimate me Lake!”
I called my dark lord karen
I am broke so I don't have the game but I do have the demo. And I will tell you.  Mage Is OP.  They can learn explosion which hits everything. because I`m on the demo its even more powerful. Which makes grinding waaaaay easier. like sometimes nobody get a turn. Thank You For Your Time.
Haha i played the 3ds version and the switch version EVERYONE WAS TOON LINK
My friend made her game with her and a bunch of our friends and it was scarily accurate
Friday night funkin' with a but of salt Pls
Finally, I don’t feel alone with putting my self-inserts and my OCs/Favorite characters into this game. It’s all I wanted to do seeing that it was coming to Switch, and I had never played the 3DS version aside from the demo.
Nintendo knew exactly what they were doing when they made this game. Or they were probably high on drugs and meth.
What is your first anime?
bro, what's wrong with your mic settings?
I’ve missed this series
4:33 wait...Invader lum! I thought nobody knew that anime. Nice to see she's at least known.
wait this is for switch now?
GIVE ME THE CODE FOR GRUNKLE STAN
I like how the dark Lord and his game is yandere Dev
FleshyFran
Hey! Crazy idea- you should try Puyo Puyo Tetris! It's a fun switch game with a cool story and funny characters and there's a second one!
I enjoyed the 3ds Version but Nintendo switch miitopia is immaculate
I NEED IT.
I have Miitopia 3ds and I loved it but I love this more because with all the extra stuff it's basically a new game to me
Bagel-guese when it sees a hunter: *angryly screaming.* 1:56
Scott: this is a new experience for me *laughs in beat the game 3 times on 3DS*
1:47 Animation lol
Whats the text to speech sounding voice he used for CC?
I chose the same exact jobs as Scott without watching his streaks
I played the 3DS one, and still enjoyed the remake
I love this game so much. It’s not serious and it’s so fun.
Ok but can i make my miis gay  OMG YES U CAN make them gay. Hell yea time to be a funky little lesbian
I played the OG on the 3DS and omg I love this port. Definitely gives original players a reason to buy this one
1:46 I have rewatched this part like 10 times
💜
nah nah, the horse is cute
Am I the only one that noticed that his mii looks like Ross from Friends?
everything's amazing when a girl is on your team...... *blankly stare into the darkness of the abyss pondering if anything does exist within but nothing, darkness, loneliness, you scream for help* (But nobody came).
Dude I can’t tell you how much I have been enjoying this game. I have put a good bit of my OCs into the game and it’s just so much fun to see them come to life.
Miitopia playthroughs are either "wellcome to oc heaven" or "you just spent 5 hours to choose a perfect meme character for this role, and it was spectacular."
This is awesome! You can make el chapulin Colorado all the way to squidward!
me : this, is a tf2 class run, where all of my team is a tf2 class. everybody : dear god. me putting a bunch of lines in spy's mask to make it look better : theres more. everybody realizing i suck at the makeup thing : NO!
love how scott gushes over seeing his 2 ocs in the game instead of MAKING A NEW EP FOR THEM you know the ones im talking about scott we all know the ones
I loved playing this on the 3Ds and inserting my OCs. I was worried that I'd be playing with all the same four characters for the whole thing, but they mix it up later on. Some of the gameplay gets jrpg repetitive, but didn't stop me from beating it.
1:47  Everyone who has touched persona 3 and added Mitsuru to their party: *pathetic*
All rise for Flesh Horse.
it makes me SO happy as someone that preordered the original that this game got so much more love than before. and fun fact, the original came out same day as the emoji movie, solidifying itself as the most shitposty game Nintendo has ever created. Mazel tov
Who is Cici?
The switch reboot is better because more interaction, a horse, and better miss
1:47
If only you could add a bit more depth to characters outside the nose, it would be great, because you can't make furries in 2D
THEY TOOK MY TEAM
A sodium free review?
God a tomadachi life remake would be my new switch addiction
the dialog for the characters repeat rather quickly which killed it for me. and the fact that other character will say the same exact thing without personality being a factor also killed the magic. it gets very repetitive after world 3, the fairy world one. Tomodachi life seemed better personality wise and contained more dialog.
2:00 - 2:06  You legit just called out half of the Miitopia fandom-
Now, I have to get this game, I have so many RPG-esque characters that need to be on goofy adventures.
dark lord: Yan dev
2:01 oof
I made the first two teams in Miitopia based on friends that i have in real life and am always shocked (and amused) on how in character they often are.
Wish they could have actually made it that way on the DS, because now I feel robbed of my money. Seriously, why should I buy an entire game console if I want to have a good expérience with this game? Why couldn't they just make the customization this fun on the 3DS ?
1:30 fnf reference
I love your character design I built a Mii inspired by your main character and he is one of my favorite Mii's 🙂
Curse your computer for deleting most of the animation but this video is still good even with just one animated segment
I wanna play this... But alas, I oly have my trusty rusty PC.
Scottfalco: this game its very easy and very meh gameplay   Me in the tower of despair:  * laughs in pain *
I seriously wanna play this but I don’t have money for it and my sister took my switch :(
1:51 as a guy with a thief soulmate, this is 100% accurate
4:33 wow u watched urusei yatsura,its rare to see people who have watched btw
Did you know that all food preferences are based on the time of day a mii is made and their facial features? Meaning while still random to our eyes, you can actually code how you want your mii to be built
I think CC would look better as a pop star but that's just my opinion.
This game 🎮 s a smash hit, Tomodachi life would be great as well. I will agree it seems lots of people just have problems enjoying a game for what it is. Honestly though that's more on them than on somebody else streaming and enjoying a game. I've caught a few streams and are always entertained so keep it up man.
speeeaking of which when is sig and tease being continued?   10/10 video btw I’ll tune into next stream
Ah yes. The only game where Luigi, Goku, and Shrek can all fight against an unreasonable threat, Yandere-chan.
Idk bout yall but the great sage theme is amazing
“ I thought it would be fun to stream.” IMMEDIATELY SHOWS A RIVER, WITCH IS ALSO KNOWN AS A STREAM.
from this ill remember " spider "
Ive been playing since release,and the only salt i have is the random ass rocks that fall and separate your crew
The name of the horse is florse
I think your horse just looks like a toy.
So what I saw from this video was that everyone but me is good at making miis in the game... god dangit
Keep in mind, you have to basically start over three times. You'll eventually be able to get your original job and party, but it was a bit annoying having to start from level one three times in one game.
YES IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOVES MIIS IN HORSE JAIL, It's the funniest things when my friend has a higer relationship with the horse than anyone else. Also, the fact I could get away with OC X Canon was great for me and my sister.
Wait, the rest of your party can't be controlled by you? *Persona 3 FES flashbacks*
I played through the first half of the game twice on 3DS and let me just say, it's insanely fulfilling on the 3DS, especially with the insane amounts of creativity.
I would absolutely love tomadochi life with the miitopia character creater
Ok. Seriously, huge props to the developers. They had to have known an RPG with Miis was a clever, yet weird concept, but they didn’t give up a forgettable filler game when they made it. They gave us a memorable game with fun gameplay and silly dialogue and cutscenes and surprisingly great music! Honestly, I hope it does get a proper sequel in the future, even if the game is a meme machine, it’s a fun meme machine that honestly deserves a sequel.
As much fun as it would have been to let my oc’s be my first set of adventures, I just couldn’t bring myself to not reunite me and my friend like I did in miitopia on the ds. Wholesome and nostalgic.
Why does his art remind of miscon
n-not the horse demon....
The 3ds title was like the switch, but it was very basic character Mii creator.
Miitopia with a side of sugar
I played the 3ds version, I love the Singh version. The customization is absolutely amazing, and there’s a few new things that don’t make it the exact same - horses, customization of course, outings. But from what I can tell so far the storyline is the same.    Spoilers ahead for the 3ds version, not sure if it’s in the switch version -  . . . . . . I hope the dragon you can ride comes back!
Imma say it. This game is the Nintendo version of Sonic Forces. But better.
Uh oh, my moneys going away
U have to yeet cc sometimes right?
5:29 the song in Built to Scale
Miitopia was a fun time for me I had matt as the dark lord
it's like miitopia in a nutshell.
My OCs are quite literally the main reason as to why I decided to play this game and I'm glad I did I should really start practicing with its mii editor though
This game is literally an artist of any kind's goldmine. I've literally drawn so many scenes from Miitopia, and I have so many OCs in the game. It's awesome and such a great remake!
I've played and beat the game on 3ds, it was epic
Eyo 3DS version doesn't have the horse that's sad
I have Miitopia for the 3DS and have the Demo for the switch version and already the memories are… yeah  Also my current party is Me, Geno, Lonk and Rosalina so yeah
Im pissed of that in 2016 the year that miitopia released it didn't even hit off. Now 4 YEARS later and it's released to the Switch and it finally hits off,  I was thinking that they did the already good game... BUT better.
The way he said konosuba is criminal
I made Minecraft Steve a Flower and shout out OLD SPICE BODY WASH as his war cry. I also went with a WRYYYY cry for myself dozens of hours before I even knew vampire was a job.  This game has a strange ability to set a bunch of pieces in just the right place by pure accident that I have a hard time believing it wasn't divinely inspired.
I wish they put more time and thought into the makeup stuff  Cause when they blink it all disappears for 5 seconds and you have to stare at what they used to be
My team is one punch man,bob ross,me,roblox noob
Him: talking about miitopia  Me: The anime eyes how do I do that
“GNYAAAAAHH”
it's very new then the 3ds
This is a port i can accept  Most Ports or Remastereds i have seen or played made me think 'why do i have to buy this if i have it already' like NSMBD but Miitopia on Switch just gives me enough stuff to make me buy it again
Scott you realize the hell you've unleashed with that Miitopia code?  I could make an entire Playthrough of CC's.
One of the best games on the switch lmao
I’m pretty sure the 3DS title forced you to  walk... or at least it made me walk.
Cant believe you are acually using it as a fanfic game, wth        no hate
I’ve never played these games so I’m kinda out of the loop, but I gotta ask...  What the fuck is a Twerky? Every time someone talks about these games my mind just remembers that.
whoo gomma tell him about failboat's *_language arts book_*?
0:58 something I never knew I needed till I saw it
some people: make normal miis and put them in the game me: ill put link, ill put mario, ill put mii fighter, ill put quote, ill put inkling, ill put some fnf characters, ILL PUT IN OMORI
0:59 some give me the access key for that Zero mii.  It looks amazing!
Cultured. Lum is an excellent first crush.
Miitopia: *exists* Composers Toshiyuki Sudo, Shinji Ushiroda, Yumi Takahashi and Megumi Inoue: Hold my beer.
And then there's me whos party consists of me, Aerith from FFVII, Max from Sam and Max and Mimikyu from Pokemon
1:46 - 1:57 Replace the MP Candy with HP Bananas and that equals my entire playthrough. They get so much as nicked and they immediately go "HP BANANA! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM!"
Yeah I agree with you Scott. I'm still hoping for a new tomodachi game too. Imagine also having the character creator that miitopia uses in it.
even as someone who played it on 3ds i’m still having the time of my life playing it on switch
Like why cant we control everyone
Let’s see how fast they discontinue this one.
CC is so adorable no matter what.
F L E S H  H O R S E  D E M O N
I have played 3ds miitopia
As someone who did play and beat the 3DS version I was all eager to do it all over again, especially with the updated Mii maker.
I want to see scot make stink!
I’ve gotten  farther than you
This isn't just a swich port, this is the 3Ds version but BETTER!
The fact that he only said 3.5 bad things about the game means its good
"This abomination Made entirely of flesh"  sounds like a normal horse to me...
Not going to lie the zero suit is cursed. Spandex/latex body suit just doesn’t fit for a Nintendo game
2:53 that look fit the music way to well espically because look traumatized by it
I wish I could play this but unfortunately I don't have a console for this nor money to buy one
The correct title: Miitopia with No Salt
Watching Shenpai play this, this game has so much meme potential
I would totally add my OCs and go on wacky adventures but I am terrified of the shading and make-up for miis
This looks very fun
What is this? Did ds judt get the short end of the stick?
Ah yes. _D A R K   L O R D   Y A N D E V_
I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks the snurp theme is a bop
Flesh horse is the child  of long horse and short horse
I had one had never heard about them who was jealous
3:51 is that a reference I spy?
Best game for OCs is Koikatsu party. Tho I don't think it is stream friendly
Was your name always scott falco? Also I love watching this
Hope this shows Nintendo the profit they can make by porting the 3ds gems over.
Oh lord, the 'who dats' hurt.
"this trap will keep me safe"  *G N E E EH H*
all ik is the 3ds title sucks so much compared to the nintendo switch-
I didnt realize their horse was made of human skin, geez... O.o
Miitopia is my all time favorite game and it came out for my bday, I was more hyped for it than my bday tbh and I already owned the 3Ds game.
Miitopia is so good. I hope they do the same for Tomodachi Life
1:47 is so reliable to mii, that happened all the time.
I played 3ds one and adore both. But the creativity of it one is out standing. Loved slowly getting more and more creative with the new wigs and makeup tools
The game is soooooooo gooooood
4:33. Oh my kami your that old I only recently found and watched some of that anime
I really wish we could customize miis like you could in this game
the switch game looks alot differnt
0:18 monster hunter rise be like:
for some reason my dumb nuerodivergent brain wants to %100 all the levels and will not let me progress until i beat all of it so.. rip me ig lmaoo
4:18 I hate it when people say “you have to pick Meta” it’s not supposed to be a hard game, it’s supposed to be fun
The Flesh Horse Stares
0:58 I SEE ZERO
Does Switch version still have the Twerkey mobs? >D  I've played the 3DS version only, and mine is Luma3DS. So, picked by free ;x
I'm just saying, the dark lord i made ranboo's iconic 👑:) and every time he appears i feel like an anime character sinse im always traumatised when the dark lord does appear
If you haven't gotten to the true final boss *Good luck*
The outdo makes me feal like this man just loves rhythm heaven so much
All these scenes and new content?!?!?! I HAVE IT ON MY 3DS AND I DONT SEE ANY OF THESENEXTRA CONTENT, HOW?!?!?!
1:25 u mean yandere Dev
You are so stupid and full of crap
As soon as I saw your vid in my recommended I was like "What? How could anyone get salty at Miitopia?"
Ok, buying it
People that "Who Dat" Lum should be sent to live on a farm. They clearly don't want to be part of real society.
Seeing your Scott and CC animations is always a treat.
They added a lot of features to mii making and others, including the horse!! I played through the entire 3ds version, but its still as charming.
Tastes suspiciously like it is lacking salt.
And I looked, and beheld a pale horse: and her name that sat on him was        ARA ARA
If tomodachi life gets a sequel I will die
I want this
Failboat made a literature textbook mii And it is legendary
Cant wait actual people going for the perfect stats
4:12 “but the majority of miitopia playthroughs have been the most well-behaved chat I’ve ever seen”  (Laughs in failboat)
ooooh this game looks like fun!
>Scott using my Goemon Mii for his Great Sage Yeah I know that choked up feeling alright.
I made OCs *for* the game when I had it on the 3DS, so making them again and getting to see them in high quality on my tv made me feel like I was seeing old friends again
When I saw Yandere dev as the dark lord i literally died.
Although this is a port, it's one of the best I've ever seen. They added so much content and made the game 100X better than the original. The best version for sure.
For some odd reason I can't want to see the day of lavos but it has the horse
I still cant believe I predicted Miitopia for the switch...
The game could feel repetitive but this game stays fun throughout the whole game. Miitopia is a very fun game with some replay values as long as you play the way you like.
Oh God do I need another Tomodachi Life 😭😭😭 I'm literally praying they bring it at E3
I was so pumped to see Lum, too bad Ten couldn't make it.
I too enjoy friendship cuckolding
I actually played the 3Ds version, in fact I still haven't I just haven't played it. However after seeing this I might as well get it for the switch and do a side by side comparison of the two
see, i love this game because i can have all of this:  - oz from monster prom talking about a guy named riddle from a japanese disney game ending danganronpa. - glorious joke ships. - xiao from genshin impact calling someone "dreamy" - using the twerkey as a target of my wrath - accidentally starting a harem because as the protagonist i am the only one with 10+ friendship with all 9 other miis right now, meaning everyone will die for me but not for each other - damien lavey from monster prom poking captain tankman from newgrounds in the butt - parappa the rapper and baizhu genshin impact acting like father and son - the first time i saw the sacrifice assist in action was captain taking the fiend's oneshot for me - KING DADDY DEAREST FROM THE HIT RHYTHM GAME FROM NEWGROUNDS, FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN - we cancel twitter. the tables have turned - riddle rosehearts went overblot again! whoops! - horse
I made my horse into Bojack Horseman
Agreed a tomadachi life sequel would be great
Yo mr monster hunter we better see one of these for the new mh stories game
Damn deja vu hit hard for me, i felt like i saw parts of this
3:52 XDDDDDDDDDDD YAY PRINCESS LUIGI!!
Nintendo has found a way to make every run through an RPG feel unique, even without a physics-sandbox engine like Breath of the Wild, and I respect them for that.
DEFINITELY WORTH IT
pls make more sig and tessa its so cool
I played this game on the 3DS so much, but man. I really want it on the Switch, it has so much more content
what anime is that at 4:32?
I really hope they put  tomodachi on the switch
flesh horse: *must consume*
i already didnt like the 3ds version for a lot reasons: Basicly, the whole game is an automatic RPG which is very VERY basic hidden behind all this mii stuff. Yes, if you would take all the "mii" stuff away, the game is very boring - and it actually is even with it. I played it for a long time on 3ds, i didnt finish it, but (SPOILER) i finished it AFTER the "Big evil boss" and saw what came up there. Next to this, its just way to easy since even if you dont have a "standard" group with a knight and healer, the game gives you this "heal and magic and REVIVE" sprinkles that you basicly cant lose. Srsly here to say, in my playtime, i never really lost a fight.  Adding the fact again that you basicly have to "count" on the randomness of your CPU people which you *CANT COMMAND* is kinda a bit bs made. After a wile i was kinda THAT MAD since the CPU was the healer and doesnt give me any healings *at all* that i went healer insteed.   So if youre looking for a "good and nice" RPG, youre in the wrong place ppl. If you just want a "stup*t and maaaaayyyybeeeeeeee fun for 6 year olds" RPG, go for it. Else if you enjoy RPGs like the Final Fantasy series, you should avoid it. Im sure you will not find any "sadisfaction" in this game, sadly.
i had this game on the 3ds and have only played the demo on on the switch and tbh i like the switch better
It’s kinda dumb that it’s double the price
I'm glad I wasn't the only one that got the Konosuba vibe (especially from that one dance). Even commented about it before on some other Miitopia vids.
D's was better because u can control everyone
Wait a minute is your outro the final remix of rythmn heaven for the ds' instrumental?
I played all of the 3ds version and this is 100% better
I don’t know about you but the idea of a Miitopia meta is too hilarious for me to comprehend.
With the response Miitopia has gotten, I REALLY hope the Switch updates and Miicreation like this is just the standard now.
This is just fanfic Konosuba
I will make…EVERY FORM OF GOKU…into this game…  All the dialogue will be filled to the brim with HI, I’M GOKU! I’M FROM PLANET EARTH-
Flesh Horse is always watching.
Miitopia is my favorite game, and it was close compared to Smash (maybe my second) and then I got attached to my Switch party and it’s gonna be there for a while.
I have the OG and I can reassure you that the switch is the definitive version. Everything is just better in every way.
my friends keep getting kidnapped and that makes me sad
Ngl Miitopia has shuffled its way up my "favorite game experiences of all time" list just because it lets me watch my OCs be the stupid bastards they are without me needing to draw it.
As a person who has played 3ds miitopia, the switch port is worth it, the makeup options are immensely entertaining by themselves, so it's worth trying the demo at least for that, and then the demo can show you how great the rest of the game still is, however the one problem is that the UI feels a bit more clunky, you come to miss being able to instantly access the safe spot or sprinkles when a party member gets low health/status effected, sometimes you are too late and they end up getting killed before you can bring them to safety or higher health, other than that I see no reason not to get it of you enjoyed it on the 3ds.
This is probably the least saltiest side of salty I’ve ever seen. That says something lol
I miss Sig and Tessa
As someone that literally bought A SECOND COPY on the 3ds to have 2 save files (I wanted to keep my 100% first save forever saved) And played this game 5 times already I was READY for this
Easily my favorite 3DS game... but I'm saving up for other stuff so I can't buy the switch one.
Haven't watched Scottfalco  in so long that I realized  why I loved it
Making mii’s in this is probably the closest I’ll get to actually making art of my oc’s.   I suck at art so pretty much all of my characters exist as words on pages.
Miitopia and Tomodachi Life have got to be the best games for casual gamers that are available. I fell in LOVE with both on the 3DS. At first, I used my friends' Miis to help with my adventure, but when they were taken away by the Dark Lord, I threw in some custom Miis and it made the game even better!! I'm psyched for this installment, especially because of the god-level Mii Maker within the game.   I was the exact same way when playing the original. The little jealousy-fused bickering was amusing, and the Switch version offers more. Praise the Nintendo gods above that they offered a demo, if only to remind me of a simpler time. ❤❤❤   Also, that CC Mii is freaking adorable. And, yeah, showing your age, but it's okay. ;) I plan on putting my first anime crush on my team too.
Miitopia, without any salt?!?!?
ok I played 3ds Miitopia and the port is better
The creation system in Miitopia is waaaayyy better than that customization in Cyberpunk.
Actually, I'm glad you didn't do "ara ara" for her catchphrase. One because she's in battle and that kind of cutesy thing is only funny for a little while and two because it's so weeb.
Where’s the salt? All I see in this video are good feelings all around?
I absolutely loved the 3ds one. When I saw the commercials for it I counted the days until I git it, I played the hecc out of the demo until I was op for the rest of the game. The switch port is way better due to the infinitely more powerful character creator. Literally the creator makes the game worth rebuying a game I already had, and playing it on a big screen is always a plus. The switch version is definitively better.
1:50 notice how the wraper is still on
My horse is an abomination made of piss color
i loved miitopia on the 3ds demo you could make new games over and over so i played it OVER AND OVER cuz i loved the game so much basicly the only new things are horse new classes and HE HD TREATMENT ON EVERYTHING nintendo: slap that hd shader on everything
As someone who spent copious amounts of time grinding for levels and making the perfect Miis for the 3DS version of Miitopia, this port was definitely worth the money. It didn't add much, but it added enough to give it spice to make it more enjoyable than the older version. I don't speak for everyone who owned the original game, but in my honest opinion, this shit's good man.
If only we could customize miis this much in Smash... xD
Note: the music is 10/10 for a mii game
The only thing I dislike about miitopia is it was cheeper at launch on the 3ds than it is now on switch
When I think of Mii, I think of Wii Play, Wii Sports, Wii Music, Wii Party, Wii Fit; There has always been a theme for the Mii. Who are these characters? This is like plastic surgery turned up to eleven!  Still a fun game; I enjoy it very much! Made a hundred fifty seven Mii characters just for this game alone.
This is the church of the Flesh horse               Praise the flesh horse
Speaking of fanart, looking forward to all the detailed pictures of Zero Suit Scott Falco.
They should use the miitopia creator for a Tomodachi Life sequel or remake
So happy you liked the game! LETS GO TOMODACHI LIFE!! We need it!!
I made myself into the Great Sage. Final boss was funny
This game just doesn't have enough GAME to justify the price. Nintendo is slappin $60 pricetags on anything they make these days.
What I really dislike about this port is that they abandoned the option for you to get random Miis from the Miiverse as NPCs. Entering a new town and being greeted by completely random creations was such a big part of the original game's charm. Now they just force you to submit them all yourself individually. That's no fun. And without the charm, Miitopia is really just an incredibly barebones excuse for a turn-based RPG.
I called my dark lord ACTUALLY dark lord so whenever they see him they're like "you'll never get away with this dark lord dark lord!"
Imagine not knowing who Lum is, Darling!!!
Twerky
Imagine modding the game so twitch chat controls the other characters :P
This game kind of makes me wish we had more than just the three character classes for Mii Fighters in Smash Bros. Imagine if you had all Miitopia's classes, who you could "import" into the game. :)
Cat is the most fun class to play as fight me
There is a meta?!
If it means anything, I played the original on the 3DS. When they announced a port to the switch, you best believe I dropped everything for the pre-order. Miitopia is an underrated gem.
My first party consists of me(thief), Simon Cowell(popstar), Kronk(chef), and turvy, a mii who's face I glued on upside down(a wizard).
Actually I did new features like the horse on the switch title
Thanks for the access code as well buddy :)
Oh, Lum. She was my first anime crush too.
I like the mii maker, but I feel like it takes it too far a little. They can loose the charm miis have. I wish the foundation and nose color were added to the normal mii maker and that’s it.
I played the game for 4 days straight lol  Edit: I bought it 5 days ago.
I used family guy characters in my party and at some point Peter was always Farting, and Joe lost feeling in his legs.
Bruh, miitopia 3ds is one oft favorite games, but I haven't got miitopia for switch yet because the character creator is kinda tedious because I always go over 70 🥴
I haven’t watched this series ever since Octo Expansion with a side of salt, I miss this.
Miitopia with a Side of..... Nothing?
1:46
I have yet to play the Switch version of Miitopia with its absolutely insane Mii Maker and its horse. From my past experiences with the 3DS version, though, it had its fair share of flaws.  You got a combat system where you can only control your starting character (meant to be yourself), no matter how many members are in your team at once.  You got a few irritating battles with time-wasting turns or even luck-based gameplay.  You got a reason not to make new Miis on the fly, because depending on how far you are in the game, they are bound to be underleveled if you make a new Mii without being prompted by the game.  You got some disturbingly sensual elements in the game, from the macho outfits being so revealing, to the friendship system using hearts to the point where it seems that love could suddenly bloom, regardless of the relationship, or my least favorite thing in the whole game...the twerkey.  I mean, when it comes to these flaws, I like to ask this: What were they thinking?! But looking aside from these flaws, Miitopia is probably one of Nintendo's most unique titles and it is generally a lot of fun.  I can't wait to get a Switch someday, and get this as one of my first games for it, along with Smash Ultimate, Mario Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, and some other essentials.
I expected this video to totally crap on Miitopia so thank you for not doing that! It's my literal favorite game, I got my hands on the 3DS version during a really hard time in my life and honestly it was the one thing I had and I use my OCs as wholesome coping mechanisms and this game was like perfect for me and the humor is right up my alley and I'm easily amused by dumb stuff like this and I love it. People can dislike this game but they should try to understand why people like it to begin with, I'm glad this game is picking up.
SCP - 428631894872 The Flesh that Rides
Ok im literally looking at this and my 3ds one, it looks so much better and amazing
Wow, Lum? The oni girl? Damn, dude, that is old. I was more of a Ranma 1/2 fan, myself. -The anime, not female Ranma.
These enemies are beneath my ocs! One is a potential world ending fish, and the other is a king the united his people against giant monsters that are hunted by hunters that kill those monsters that also wanna kill him and his people. He also fought a literal universe ending god. He died but he did hold his own for about 5 minutes.
I hope you get to one million subscribers you definitely deserve it, I love your vids
Miitopia makes me want to buy a switch
They need to make a new Tomodachi Life
Scott: I'll make good looking mii versions of my characters! Failboat: I'll make beautiful abominations and the cute shrimp! Rtgame, who made iwantdie a horror of miis with the original mii maker: I must never find this game lest I create an eldritch horror!
“Man, what a great customizer!”
good things about miitopia on the 3ds: amazing music fun dialouge kept me occupied during online classes (horrible decision on my part) very long and great story very grindy which kept me wanting to play so i could get just a little farther in the story  good things about miitopia on the switch: all of that horses outings (that river scene is beautiful) the obscene customization people got level 99 relationships and got insanely powerful in the demo
The amount of times my team was below 50% of health and it’s my Flower teammate’s turn, and i’m pleading them to use Flower Bed but instead they use Bluster to not even do that much damage to the enemy and I have to use my damn sprinkles to heal the team is infuriating.
Miitopia title theme is a banger
The noise you made towards CC is gonna make me laugh hysterically no matter how many times I hear it.
FLESH HORSE SEES YOUR SINS
how old is CC exactly?
I played the original and still bought this one. There were a few new things for me and I still enjoyed it. The main reason to buy, as you stated, is for the updated character creator. The miis were diverse before, but, this... this is a whole new level of ascension for Mii creation. I'm calling it now: This makeup and wigs system is going to stay in the next console. (I have no idea how Nintendo's going to improve on the Nintendo Switch, but, It's 4 years old at the time of this comment... it's coming in the next couple years.  Nintendo's been casually playing with VR... maybe soon?)  Sure, the demo allows you full use of the updated mii creator, but, if you want your miis to actually do something and enjoy the wacky story that Miitopia has to offer, you have to buy the game.
Back in the day, we had Yee ol colours that were more abundant and the silly nose in mouth or eyebrow trick.. It surely has been fun..  They remade it.  Well I just feel cheated now. They get horses and I'm just stuck wondering why the tank doesn't have some other cool army moves. The warrior gets tons and can effectively be a team on its own. Just slapping each other into health.
4:35 I’m gonna say it                                           Who dat
What
Scott chose the Chef class because he's the best
Nobody: This guy: "Miitopia is a Fanfiction writter disguised as a character creator disquised as a video game"
As someone who played the 3DS, this made it even better. One of my friends literally argued with me because all I talk about anymore is Miitopia..
Bnana.
Banana
4:26 understandable 😂
Hope to see a sig and Tessa episode in near future
Was I the only one who played this seriously? I am weird.
Fun fact, Miitopia is rated 18+ in Russia due to the ability to form homosexual relationships
Flesh horse knows all your sins. Flesh horse is coming
Dark lord Yan Dev that’s great.
I made Hank from Madness Combat and since I already had a thief, I made him a chef lol
1:32 battles are NOT random encounters, if you play a certain level, you will always get the same enemies at the same place you met them last time, and they will always give the same EXP
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I really want to play this now
price "high" its only 50$  its not like its a full priced port
Video so good my cat watched it
Miitopia, fever dream the game
Just for people looking at the comment that have played the game, Miitopia's demo is free and it has the character creation in it.  You are only missing jobs for the demo.
Lol 1:46
3:50  Im not gonna say it am i?....im not...I'm..i can't       Hello mario       I couldn't do it, im sorry
woah, im not the only one who actually liked miitopia? i played it on 3ds but this looks incredible how much new content is there o_O
I went into a miitopia stream and the first thing a I saw was Scott “becoming close” with the horse
I played the og miitopia, and looking at this one, I don’t think I’ll like it as much.
The content literally writes itself in this game
1:50 too true (  =w=)
Dude, this is awesome! XD
Dark lord yandev... sounds right
oh look Sig and tessa as a couple...  Sig jealous of CC. (the music doesn't help thinking he wants to murder CC)  Sig Yandere confirmed.  the game is literally a puppet show... i like it but... can't affort a switch.
hmm that does sounds pretty good, but at 50$ I think I'll wait till a sale.
oh, well here i was thinking this old ds game had suddenly gotten popular for no reason. welp, i feel dumb. remake gotcha gotcha
You have no idea how much 2:40 killed me.
Is it me or the thumbnail changed
You said ypu never played the 3ds version   I mean they are pretty much the same but this obviously has better graphics. Plus the new stuff they added.
Can we get some unedited videos of this
"If you have OCs and want to see them go on adventures, it's definitely worth it"  Ok, I felt that one _personally_
I made Sans X Komaeda fan fiction, while a parody of Hentai and a Miku clone also became a lesbian couple. Edit: Miku was friendzoned,
We’re all here with you before 1m subs Scott!
Yes but have you fought pharoh will smith
I played the 3ds game and tbh the switch one feels almost completely different and I only payed 40$ for it at Walmart which was a steal
I've played the 3DS version and am now playing the Switch version, and all I can say is, This is still one of my favorite games and it just got even better.
God I miss the Alloys from brawl
Eldritch Flesh Horse, Lord of Leather, Wishes to be your aquaintance!
Player of the old 3DS version here. The switch version was a huge step up from the 3DS, as there was no real character customization, it was more just take a Mii throw it in play. I have yet to fully play the Switch, but it certainly has more customizing, funny scenes, and overall quality of life change from its forefather.
I have 108 OC. For a dude like me this game is littéral heaven.
I put my friends and family as everyone in miitopia aside from louis and peter griffin, and i gotta say its almost creepy how perfect the dialogue is sometimes
SHAMPOO
Make Hinoa and Minoto un secret PLEASE!
I had miitopia on the 3DS already, but I also bought the switch port. I’m glad I got it
This was a salt substitute and y’know, I’m fine with that lol   I played in the 3DS and absolutely adore this game. It’s just too charming to ever really be upset with.
one word twerkey
CC is so adorable
I was a bit skeptical about getting this earlier on but now I definitely want it
Miitopia with a side of sugar. That's new for this channel.
So as someone who played miitopia on 3ds   It’s even better and more enjoyable on switch
One of the best reviews I've seen👍
I had the 3DS version, and I’m currently right in the middle of the switch version and honestly,,it’s such an upgrade. Everything Is so much more polished, and I would say there’s a lot more content to explore!!! Overall, if you enjoyed the 3ds version you will adore the switch version :)
I love how you put together your  mii characters😂🥰
My main problem with the games that you can't really make a character serious, like my main OC is a serious guy who doesn't put up with anything, but then there are multiple times in the game where they give the Mii character "cute anime eyes" like, for example, when there's an apology, they start to act all cutesy and touchy with each other so I just chose to not add him
Scott: just do your sweep attack on all the low HP enemies and we can beat this in one turn! CC: MP Candy? Scott: w-NO! Sweep! CC: I’m already eating it Scott: OH COME ON! CC: This trap will keep me safe Scott: NGAHHH-
Miitopia, for when you’re to lazy to write or draw self insert stuff, so let the game do it for you.
There's no salt it weird.... but I like it
I got the Demo of this game and the 1st town's Mayor was some dude named "Doofus"
*As everyone else is waiting for splatoon 3 and botw 2 to come out while Nintendo is making remakes of games*
Mii Maker is a gift from the gods.  Like one of my playthrough had everyone as Homer Simpson
I made an among us mii the dark lord  now every time he appears I see the word  *Dark lord* amogus  on my screen  no regrets
Miitopia when I can't find a D&D group to join. I think this maybe the reson I been looking at it.
Hello
I love miitopia. My first team was anime themed: Jupiter (sailor moon) Chili (Pokemon) And fat gum (mha) 2nd team was animal crossing Lucky Kid cat Skye And my 3rd team was my ocs Kori (sailor moon oc) Marcel (werewolf oc) Blaze (MHA oc) Oh and my main charcter was my oc and channel icon twinkle the Umbreon.
Miitopia is pretty good.
You can really tell that a lot of love was put into the Switch remake of this game.  They could've just ported the files of the 3DS version into the switch. But no, they really went above and beyond for this game.
3 years too late
This is my favorite game of all time.
The amount of animation fodder you could get out of this game is nigh-bonkers.
I ask you for a minute of your time to help me fulfill my dream of being an artist for the short time I have left in life I have cancer and I am disabled without friends why I cannot leave my house because of the bullying that they do to me why I was not lucky enough to have a good physique but I love myself as I am because that was what I got blessings and God bless you all
For me this types of games are the proof that you don't need to be good or hard, you just need to be charming enough sometimes...
Miitopia is so much more fun than it has any right to be.
Whoa! Did I see Goemon as the Wise Sage!? You just made my day!
I want to hug CC.
Anime jesus, arthur from that one kids show, gooigi, and putt putt as a female pop star
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MORE SIZE OF SALTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Just gonna say that the 3ds versions is, as always, fucking limited in everything
1:47
1:57
1:51
You and Ross made some neat looking miis
20 on trending!
I played the 3Ds version which was very fun but my main complain has always been that you can only play one character but hey, I'm happy with this one too
Honestly wish they’d do a system update adding Miitopia customization to the Switch OS with access keys so you can share them with friends for multiple use in Switch titles
1:56 made me laugh more than it should’ve
Mp candy:how many more do you need My party members:one million mp Candy's Me:stop buying it
And then there’s me who made all of my best friends the main characters so I could simulate hanging out with them just to get to the 2nd power wipe and end up having to use one of my cats because I ran out of friends.
meat horse belong in Oven (large)
As someone who played the 3DS,I can say the switch version is better
“If everyone is close jealousy starts to rear its ugly head”  Me: wat? My main team are all at atleast level 20 with eachother.... i... i dont grind it just happens normally..l
CC trying to show tessa how to work the pole XD (Splatoon 2 reference)
I started playing it with my ocs as party members and so far... their interactions are fitting. Like uncanny.
I agree with this entire video The charm of this game genuinely gives off undertale vibes in a way and that somehow makes me nostalgic
Hey Scott! What would your thoughts be on making a vod channel to slap your streams in? I just think it’d be neat is all ya know?
My first party member was a hyper realistic Majima from Yakuza...I was sold.
Miitopia with a side of Pepper?
You should post your Access Key Code (I kinda really want Hinoa fron Rise lol)
Miitopia was made weird by Nintendo, and it’s even weirder
Compare to 3ds title this feels like more of a remake then a port to the switch
'Sig and Tessa getting into weird and random scenarios even if it wasn't my writing'  Bold of us to even think you still write them lmfao
^Where is the salt though?
Coming from someone who played Miitopia on the 3DS and watched the trailer for the port over to nintendo switch, i was ecstatic despite having already played the game
@1:54 - "This trap will keep me safe." "YAAARGH!"  Yeeeeah, that's basically what my own Thief based on Yusuke from Persona 5 kept doing, first turn, he'd use Booby Trap... against MAGE GOBLINS whose normal attack ignores traps. X(
I had all my OCs (and snoop dog) in the first map and got super attached to them and when they forced me to grab a new party it crushed me and its hard for me to pick it back up now
Holy crap! Your Lum looks so good!!!
Now that i realise the mii's look like the people frm happy dungeons and happy wars (rip happy dungeons)
I died inside as you said mp chugging miis hate mp boosting foods
I’m glad I got this for my graduation of 8th grade, anyway.
I may not have ocs but I have fictional characters I treat like my ocs so I think that's a good enough reason if anything to get it
Lum? Damn boy. That anime's almost as old as I am.  (Still good though.)
Hold on hashira I’m coming
Bro I almost cried tears of joy when I saw that this game was coming to switch. Most hyped game of the year. The 3ds one went under appreciated. I’m so happy more people get to experience this game. Screw the cpu party members. Always found it annoying.
The Mii creator this game has...it NEEDS to be the golden standard for all Mii creators now. I mean...that, or being able to make a Mii in Miitopia and exporting it to your system's Mii library, so it can be used in other games.
They milked all the sass out of Animal Crossing and put it here.
1:57 NAÄÁÄH
How the hell do people add ears to their Mii's? What category makes it so it's not floating above them? I use glasses for their fox ears and it floats above her head which I don't mind, but I do wanna add elf ears to some of my characters. Is it mask? In that case, you would have to make the ears separately.
I don't know what Nintendo was on when making Miitopia, but they done a good job about it.
Sorry for interruption but this is an urgency for Our LORD JESUS CHRIST is coming soon and we are trying to help spread this message as many as we can. Please repent and come back to GOD. Ask for HIS Guidance and help throught LORD JESUS CHRIST.

0:03: thats cute
God that horse looks like a sin eater
Wow this is the first time I've seen him make a video that is basically 96 percent complementary
Stopped watching at the "Jealous of CC" scene, going to go play it. Took a shower and let the video play for the watch time, Commented and liked, Already Subbed since reaper side of salt. Good work man, I will re-watch after playing the game.
Miitopia with a side of sugar
Miitopia Is Good So Far
I'm just glad that this masterpiece of a game was ported to Switch.
Im so happy we haven't forgotten Sig and Tessa.

I really need to get this port huh. They've added a bunch of stuff since the 3ds version too which seems cool, and at least I ported my favorite mii to my switch before both my 3ds and wii u went out of service.  Time to get cracking again
Oh my god tomodachi life with this mii creator would be insane
Dark Lord YanDev   Fucking lol
Im suprised you didnt do a miitopia cc replacement for the outro on this vid, woulda been funny
5:13  Gah, what is that sting from? FFVII, right?
I´ve put waaayyy too many hours into the original game back then, and I just got the remake and have to say they made a good job with it. I´m only at the elven woods atm, but already there is such a big amount of new  content, that the investement was worth it.  Also seeing my friends and OC interact with one another is so much fun.
As someone who played it so much on the ds, I'm very happy it has a port to switch so more people can explore the 'beauty' of Miitopia
More like side of heart, cause all you said was what everyone was thinking
Bear with me guys, why da hell did they add the spin off of tomodachi life to the switch before tomodachi life could be added to the switch?
You missed the #1 selling point, tho.  Turkeys.
flesh horse... why flesh horse?
Miitopia, without a grain of salt?
hey what were the songs playing in this
I have squidward as my lax soldier too lol
Why is chef the chad gamer role
"Well-behaved chat"  Scott's literally the only guy who complains about chat. I've seen your chats, there's not a single moment where anyone's been 'misbehaving'. My advice: stop hanging around those retarded mods you call friends, they flip the fuck out over more shit than any schizo I've ever known. Especially Limons, that dude needs to take some pills.
miitopia sales after this video are going to skyrocket
I desire this so much. But i have no switch. But i got dat 2011 wii family edition B)
I cast myself as the hero... and he likes none of the things i do.
Finally miitopia gets more recognition. Thank you
I'm looking forward to the release on PCs.  OH WAIT!
Ahem...The Fab Fairy dance.
5:12 the true boss of Miitopia
"OH NO ITS THE DARK LORD" "Which one? Ganon" "NO ITS WORSE" "Galeem?" "NO ITS YANDERE DEV" "Dear God"
As someone who loved the 3DS version, I dove to my switch to preorder the switch version as soon as it was announced and I am NOT disappointed in any way. Sure the game is a bit easy at first now that I know what to expect and have been grinding a bit (mostly to get those yellow flags on the map, I like going down all the paths) but I'm still having a blast replaying this game and I really hope that Tomodachi life 2 is announced after how well this game did.
I have been PLAYING THIS NON STOP XD I really hope they make tomadachii life port o3o bc I never played that on the 3DS either :( these ports have been super helpful xD
Me: waiting for salt*  *no salt*               :(
Lol! I love your streams Scott!
Is the switch version worth getting if you’ve played on the 3ds?
i made scott my king when he shared the friend code =p
So i looked up Lum.... the younger me would have been excited, binged that, and looked for it's doujinshi. But the for me NOW: I am disgusted. I didn't ever imagine i could stumble on the show that is the ancestor of all ecchi harem thottery and coomerism.   Thank you Scott Falco for giving me something to hate (and i say that as someone who still likes Konosuba)
Is Scott and I the only people to pin Luigi as the princess?
Mii sport
I wouldn't mind seeing the gameplay expanded to handle more specific scenarios (e.g. if I were to add Ice King from Adventure Time as a character, he should get ice-based spells) of course, the trick is to figure out how to do this without detracting from Miitopia's simplicity.
Hey Scott um red dead redemption not 2 uh Side of salt,also loved the video was a bit short but I know how long it takes between playing the game having to animate scenes and draw but none the less great video.
I was with the horse idea until 1. It basically removes all mp 2. Useless late game sadly 😭😭
as someone who played the og miitopia this is def worth your money
I like to think CC only pretends to be stupid in battles to piss off Scott.
Oh no, people don't know Lum? Now I feel old too, damnit.
oh shit Lum, the 90s? anime alien in a tiger bikini?
I played the 3DS and On sight this looks like a lot more polish version than it. Lot of more cut scenes, bonding moments, and even new content. 3DS is still fine and hell there is a demo of it free to play still on the DS but this looks a lot nicer.
nice thing is that it isn't just a direct port, i know new things were added for the switch version, the upgraded mii maker is new, the horse is new, and i believe a couple more classes were added.
Pfft who plays metta......😐 you heard me.
After this video an ad for miitopia played  YES YOUTUBE I KNOW I WANT IT
he put yan dev as the villan thanks scout
I PLAYED THE 3DS AND OH MY GOD THEY GIVE YOU A HORSE?? I WANT A HORSE WHY DOSENT THE 3DS GAME HAVE HORSES
>Whos Lum  Time to get me mallet
Im still not forgiving my sanity for reasons im not telling people cuz fuck you
Due to some paranoia of losing very rare food permanently and some grinding  I now have over 700 grub :)  If someone asks for details, i will respond
1:56 this is a certified NaAaAaAa moment
"is Sig getting cucked by CC" is not a sentence I thought I'd hear today and honestly I'm surprised I made it this far now that I WANT to hear more
why arent you at a million yet
My personal only gripe of the Swtich version is that there is no option to select random Mii's. The 3DS version had this feature where once you load up the game and pick your Hero. You could select randomize and it will select from a database and be completely random. you won't know who's who until you Walk around the town.
One word family guy
Good video!
The makeup reminds me of making formees in Freakyforms.
A side of salt? Miitopia only deserves a grain or two.
fuck this i'm getting miitopia again
I've played the 3ds version I've played the demo and just in the demo alone there is a lot of new content
Sounds like fun.
-frame rate-
Oh shit it totally made my characters Aqua, megumin, and Darkness lol
Time to go buy this
I made CC into a flower in a Samus suit lol
Wait he did miitopia   So a tomodotchi life side of salf when
Everyone else’s horse: *C U R S E D* My horse: named and designed after my first horse in Breath of the Wild because I love that horse and wanted to see her again
I decided to train up three more tanks after beating the Darkest Lord to take on the postgame with. Speed doesn’t matter when nobody has speed
That zero mii is honestly my favourite thing I’ve seen come out of the creator
I feel you on being old  when you mentioned Lum :'(
:)
Wish these streams were archived somewhere.
4:34 She's from the popular manga series Lum Invader right? I haven't watched the anime or read the manga, but I've heard good things.
If i have that game i will probably spend like 3 hours only to make my main character
Thank you for the video.
I never followed or knew about the "miitopia meta" so I don't really care about its existence  Also I've played the 3DS version and I'm reliving that exact experience on switch (same miis)
Yooo! urusei no yatsura shit that and ranma 1/2 was the shit
Bruh I don't know why people thought the 3ds ver of the game thought it would be boring but when I saw it I was like "Mama give me this game now or else I will tear out ur organs and sell them on the black market for money so then I can buy the game" and it was pretty fun but this is what I really said to my mom "mom can I have this game plz" (Ps I was like 5 or 6 when I saw the game trailer)
Dude your OCs especially CC translated amazingly into mii form. Also that Luigi mii in a Peach dress. Nice reference.
The mii creation is the best mistake nintendo has ever made. The sheer power at our disposal is immense. I'm still making the entire Metal Gear Rising cast
“That would make the game even easier than it is."  You haven't beaten the game yet, have you?
I made every party member into people I want or be ok with in smash and made the dark lord Sakurai which made me realize, does anyone actually make the heroes outside of the protagonist themselves.
can we get this man to 1mill subes buy the bend of this year
Wished I could upload other peoples mii without having to purchase the online thing
I want a Tomadachi life on the phone!  Or at least the Mii maker-
I played it on 3ds originally, and I still loved the switch version
We need an update on Smash to upgrade Mis to this level or that they let's use these Miis in the garage game creator.
Behold, the princess:  *Dramatic turn....*  KIRI-CHAN! - Princess Majima Goro
Just literally make konosuba lol
On the one hand, Lum is hot and I like her voice,but on the other hand she's a bit quick with the electricity.
Part of me really wants to get Miitopia but at the same time, I am uncreative as hell so i'll probably not get the full experience
I played this game religiously on the 3ds. I play it like I'm part of a cult on Switch. The post game stuff is surprisingly repayable.
Great vid as always dude.
If you played the 3ds abd are mad at the port that is bringing more attention to this game, stop and ask yourself why?
everytime i see the reveal for whatever face the princess has i always remember a dumb discord meme where the princess is goro majima from yakuza
Seeing all these pristine mii creations from god makes me wish i was better at mii making
Waiting for the day Scott makes a full video about the lore/ mechanics of CC
Awwwwwww Flesh horse............. I’m just realizing now this comment makes way more sense when you actually watch the video
I actually played the 3DS version when I was younger, and I loved it then, and think it's WAY BETTER now. All the mii styles where really basic in the original, so you had to work with what you had like in Smash 4 and Ultimate, and of course the horse is new, but in the end, I still bought the remake even though I got the original still, I highly think that it's worth it.
can't wait for the flesh horse horror game
Miitopia is literally the best game ever
I’ve played the entire game, you are going to *enjoy* this
All I can think of is... F l e s h  H o r s e
The unholy beast that is your horse must be purged
Speaking as someone who played the original, the extra mii editing and better sharing makes this version so much better. Mii monsters may have been a thing in the original, but you could legitimately commission someone to make top quality miis and get your money's worth this time around. Which, for a game based entirely around "haha funny mii do a funny thing..." yeah, that's pretty important.
CC cucking Sig is canon now
Who tf made that nova mii it looks insane
Maybe nintendo should remake tomadachi life aswell
Man it really sucks missing these streams from how much you talk them up.
But is it online playable?🤔
4:51 I dont think you would need a brush for that...thing sig
I’m so happy people are finally giving this game the recognition it deserves
I love Miitopia, however I have one complaint with the switch version. There is no option to randomly get a list of online miis assigned to roles. Other than that I love the port and glad I got it again
Tessa Cameo let’s go!!!!
someone is gonna mod this game and make it the most accesible fanfiction tool for visual novel writers
No one knows who lum is?..
Uhh... so...  Who dat?
The only salt here is in your cooking
As someone who played on 3ds, this is an AMAZING port! There's so much added, in 3ds there wasn't makeup or wigs, or a horse, but those alone add so much
This video would be a side of salt if the game was noodles and butter or scrambled eggs.
Chat not knowing Lum hurts me
The little events that happen like Miis going to a Cafe or to the Beach are new to the Switch version. The only interactions outside of battles and stages took place entirely inside the Inn's
I'm legit super happy this is on switch now I lost my original game file when my 2ds broke but this and tomagachi life were my most played games in middle school
the miitopia meta someone tell what that is
*beats the Dark Lord** **sudden plot twist**  "Okay, time to change the Dark Lord."
5:13
As someone who has poured several days worth of game time into miitopia, I can say that, at least for me, miitopia on switch is well worth the purchase
[0:43] literally why i do quality control on my mii roster nowadays 😱
Thank you for providing this content for the consumtion of people like us :)
Not gonna lie, CC is adorable
I think C.C would be great friends with burn bot, there both bots and there owners are animators, although different animation techniques
E
*2:10* Yeah, Miitopia just *does* that, even in the 3DS version. I'm convinced the game is sentient. Lmao.
WDF, GOEMON!? O-o
Goblin CC warms my cold, dead heart
I'm a simple man, I see Sig and Tessa, I like.
oh so thats why i didnt get why there was a horse, it was remastered to the switch
he saw it all
Miitopia is my favorite game
Snurp theme best theme.
Ive Player the 3ds Version and the switch Version and i gotta say. Its another but not entirely different experience. You get a different fiel with all the New features
The composer didn't have to go as hard as they did, but we thank them for it.
I love watching your streams of this game!  Your YandereDev impression is so spot on, I'm constantly laughing whenever he shows up, it convinced me to get the game myself to be honest, and I've been having a blast too!
I still have the demo and my team is My Mii, Matt from Wii Sports, Sayori from DDLC, and lenny face who is a girl apparently
Do A Rhythm Heaven Video
I like most of the game, but the one part I hate is when... (spoilers)         The Dark Lord kidnaps your party and resets your level.
honestly i’ve been playing miitopia with an RNG for my characters and it’s been equally cursed and blessed
Tomodachi Life would be one of the greatest games in history…  Since we can see Wario and Waluigi have a child in Ultra HD.
1:17  ok but the funny spin in battle going into spin for cutscene is funny
Lum best waifu
Can’t wait for oot3d switch port to exsist
I played the demo, I had a blast inserting my closest friends in it. The one that's really damns scatterbrained got the fishing without bait bit. It hit so close to reality the laughing started to hurt. Didn't see many good Mii to steal from server though, and I am not artistically inclined to be making Miis. :(  The animation with CC had me in stitches, by the way.
*47Th on trending Baybeeeee!*  Doing good work Scott!
Am I the only one that wants a full version of the outro
i bought the 3ds version of miitopia and beat the main story less than 6 months before the new port was even announced. im kinda pissed, ngl lol edit: played the switch version, i would definitely recommend it over the 3ds version, even if you find a 3ds version for half the price lol. the whole new makeup system and horse really does add a lot to the game, and it is very fun to play one of my old favorites with a fresh coat of paint!
Even if barely no salt was thrown I enjoy these reviews of yours. Keep having fun! 😊
The part were Sig was Jealous of Tessa killed me xD
Or ... Like i like to call it: "Mario rpg whit a pisk of cocane but for kids"
if you could control your teammates it would feel lonely
Post the vids on yt
Flesh Horse is the beast of the night that shall haunt my dreams for decades to come as it *slaughters dozens in its horrid wake*
I played the 3 DS version and it’s about the same, just improved upon.  But the enemies got weird after a while.  Just wait till you have to face the ‘Twerkys’.
I still remember when my Mii in the 3DS version ended up hating cheesecake. I considered this blasphemy because to me cheesecake is practically ambrosia in dessert form.
All I’m going to say about miitopia is; I went on a quest with cat shaggy through a haunted house like area, after which we found his dog and then shaggy’s face was then plastered onto his sleeping dog we fought the shaggy dog enemy to then reunite shaggy with his dog (bizarrely not named scooby) So yeah thank you miitopia
Congrats on the trending brother
Hey Scott what do you think about this? I am a hammer main In mh but I am also a areo-spray main in splatoon
This is definitely my favorite game of all time, it's super personal to me, it's on my favorite console, it's got great gameplay, lots of good times and the switch port is good
As someone who (formerly) had the 3ds copy I can easily say this new version made me eager as ever to dive back in and this time for sure 100% it. And this was after my copy died when I was nearing my goal! Horse is fun but also makes the game even easier then before and the graphics being in lovely HD make my face muscles curve, like you know in the good way. Glad to see so many other people getting into this absolute gem!
I'd love an updated tomodachi life
It's also great that the demo is a lot of content and isn't something you can finish in one sitting, especially since you have access to the character creator which I want to see return for other mii games and the mii maker in general
Also Scott....Tom has Lum too lol
Miitopia is a game of make it yourself and enjoy. Lol It's silly and fun.
I only put in original miis in my miitopia game.
Where is..... STINK?!?!?
Lum is best girl
Fun fact: The original miitopia was rated 18 in russia because GAY RELATIONSHIPS
Biomutant?
I consider miitopia to be one of the most casual rp game experiences.
So does Sig now canonically have a broken nose? Never seen a nose bend like that before, Jesus.
image a update to switch that gives us the mii making that is of mii topi, nintendo us mii lover would be super happy.
Having missed all the streams of late due to them only being on Twitch, the funniest thing in this video to me is that the ScottFalco character either is in a chef outfit or the Zero Suit costume. Hmmm....
I've played the 3DS version, and I can say this, it's  much less in terms of creativity than the switch version. It's also a good bit less fun, would recommend the switch version of the 3DS version 100%
My only wish was you could edit the emotes
How do i download your miis into my game
Tessa looks amazing but Sig’s nose is cursed
Now make a stream highlights video specifically for miitopia
When I played this on my 3ds I made the quizmaster Steve Harvey.
Your main mii: ok fight so we can win this battle! Your buddy: WhY nOt I eAt An Mp CaNdY iNsTeAd? Your main mii: no Your buddy: already ate it Your main mii: bruh Your buddy: Ok I mAkE tRaP Your main mii: BRUH
[Spoilers for the final boss if you care]        Ok so I played Miitopia on the 3DS and one of my miis was Guy Fierri who made the chef class, and I remember the final boss has this one attack that brings everyone’s hp done to 1, but at the same time, my mii and Guy Fierri had an interaction which got us an increase in friendship, so we instantly got our health back. So yeah, that’s how I inadvertently cheesed the final boss and is one of my favourite video game memories
Imagine getting locked in a stable with Nightmare Meat Horse only to find out they’re pretty chill, and figuring out combo attacks
I have opened a lot of chests in my Miitopia journey, and so far 2 of them are traps.
Remembers kids, do Mii, not Wiid.
i would pay 300$ for a port of Tomodachi Life with this Mii creator
1:46 Robo-Chan is Actually in the game just to smite you scott
No seriously, who the fuck is Lum?
The binding of Isaac with a side of salt?
0:00 Nani? Nani. Nani!
Ah yes my 4th favourite game of all time
That zero mii is spot on When the game... "Opened up" however, I kinda thought to myself; I gotta play more of this? And I kinda started to hate the game. The first half is good, the second half feels dragged out
Oh yea i remember sig and tessa.
My mii in this game is a complete asshole he often uses the teamates either as ammunition or human shields
I have 300 MP candies and 2 bananas. Help
I agree with the konosuba vibe my favorite anime by the way and that is way my team is kazuma and the gang. But it is probably because I'm obsessed with konosuba.
0:56  I THINK the reason is framerate.... Seriously, you have a bunch of these highly customized Miis on screen at one time. The game lags HARD. I noticed this with the Cinema Outing Ticket event.  That said.... If they could solve that issue. Then I HIGHLY agree. More wigs, adding detail to the original hairdos to make them more on par with the wigs. And yeah, you'd have a Mii maker fit for the next Nintendo console.  The only kind of... odd thing about the game. There's no way to check who originally made a Mii. And you can edit the ones you downloaded. I feel like there should have been an "originally made by" thing or something.  But yeah, I've been having a lot of fun just making Miis, and posting them on Twitter and the like.
I missed this series sooooo muchhhh
Do they have a ScottFalco ending ringtone? :0
0:57 Oh My GOOOD THIS MII IS PERFECT !!!!
But yall still should try the 3ds version because it's ofc the Original XD And It was the game I played before the switch version got even announced XD It's fun
Scott in the Zero Suit gives me joy.
My biggest surprise was that the port with effort cost less than a port without effort
i thaught your horse was ment to be made out of clay
Huh. Wonder how they do their personalities....
I did in fact play through the entire story on 3ds and this Switch port is 100% awesome, both just for the increase in graphic quality and for the added stuff like Outings and clothing options. Edit: Okay apparently the clothing options without taking bad stats was in the 3ds version??? I had no idea.
Wait... I played the 3DS version and... There's a Mii class meta? SINCE WHEN?!
1:56 the man is having a seizure
@0:25 yoooo. is that el chapulin colorado?
Was this a side of salt or side of sugar?
How do u have those eyes!? And mouths!? And everything I've never seen before!
just remember to stay hydrated
This just makes me want to see more Sig and Tessa content
nice game
I love that you have Yandere Dev as your villain; that's gold. Very fitting.
Tomidatchi life 2: after life
this game looks so stupid... I love it already
Theres only one way it could be better its called removing switch online bought your console and game lemme play online
Man this is actually good. Thanks for the heads up!
"Making the game easier than it already is" *Laughs in New Lumos*
As someone who played through Miitopia 3DS a frankly absurd amount of times: switch release was very worth it.
when i saw lum it was such a coincidence because i just started the show like two days ago
"Consume Face Chalice."
As someone who did play the original, i feel like this is one of those "port it everywhere" games. Maybe make a sequel one day, but the concept is just too fun to let it be lost to time. Not only is it fun to throw in ocs and waifus with your self insert, you can even get some frieds together to just watch the chaos.
Yeah i agree, miitopia looks way better in the switch. Its not that i dont like games being ported to the switch, i just dont like how people trashed on the wii u for not having any good games, but not only are they liking all the wii u games that were ported to the switch, but they are also asking for more...
I wish I could play it.  I enjoyed it on the 3DS.  Also I low-key wanna know what anime Lum is from.
Creation is godly but im the type who feeds on the fun of the battles
I would really want to see Miitopia’s Mii creator is used in another Tomodachi life game
i already gave my miis a little bit of personality before this, so this is just perfect
miitopia 3d kind of sucks ngl
god i remember playing miitopia on my 3ds, it's so weird seeing miis look like this i LOVE IT
The amount of positivity from this video about a game I absolutely adore just makes me happy
Honse
I found out I could put swears in the game because I tested it out... It led to a pretty funny clip though.
The game is amazing, but the soundtrack designer deserves an award
Sig, Tessa, Lum, and evil horse.  Nice
Miitopia and miitomadachi life are gifts from god
I had one of my Oc's as the great sage. This OC is canonically 7'10. Apparently some of the characters have locked heights (I  mean it will ignore the proportions of the mii assigned to that role and just use the ones attached to that character.) , so it now looks like a good portion of my mii's are taller than or around 7'10 in height.
Hey talk to youtube, they keep unsubbing me TT^TT
The drama ensues.
Fro some reason “miitopia meta” is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard
This video gives me hope for a new episode of Sig and Tessa. One day... (love your content!)
If you can get a game to make twitch chat behave, you know it’s good
you should lock yourself with the horse for a certain hero only skill(I won't be surprised if you didn't get it till after beating the dark lord). "miiTIPia"
Has anyone else noticed that there's always some weird guy talking throughout every Cyborg-chan video?
i've played the miitopia 3DS version. 4 times. i agree that this game oozes charm and i loved "playing" it, even though i didn't mess around with the editor nearly as much as a lot of other people did. but my main problem comes from the monotony during the second half and the fact that you're moreso watching an interactive movie than playing a game. that being said, it's a damn good interactive movie
Just in time. I was seeing so many recommend late time. Failboat made me get more into it lol.
Yeah, when I saw the miitopia trailer I was like "meh",  but I decided to give it a chance, and man.. it's very very fun!
This game is amazing and I'm willing to buy it a second time.anyone else agree?
1:46 as a person who has played miitopia for a long time i can say this is relatable
I’ve almost completed the game on 3DS.   To me the fact you must have codes to select miis or popular from the 3DS version in the demo, takes away from the charm of hitting the random button for all of your NPCs then getting by chance Gordon Ramsey for the Wandering Chef.   Maybe they did add it to the Switch for the full release but I don’t know about it, someone can correct me.
A game with no salt? I thought that was just a myth
3:59 GOEMON!
flesh horse
0:22 I didnt expect to see a mii of El Santo here, but I appreciate it
I like the Flesh horse at the end no matter where you go Flesh Horse will always find you
Heh :3
Miitopia is a blessing AND a curse. That's all I gotta say about it.
i had played the 3ds version and hearing that a port was being made for switch made me fucking ecstatic i have now as of commenting this logged over 100 hours into this fucking game.
I accidentally made myself a chef, and I’m still kinda mad about it..
I turned my OC into a gay catboy
yeah but is it worth 50$ plus?
Wait, important question Scott. Is the flesh horse random flesh sta0pled into a horse like shape, or is it the flesh of a horse that is now a blob like abomination?
That horse looked more like a gyroid than flesh tbh. 😂
As someone who has played the 3DS version there are several more things that make the game so much worth playing! The horse is such a good add, the way you can change the faces so much more is also a really good add on. It is definitely worth it even having played the 3DS version it’s still a great experience.
how is it that the two videos I've wated about this port they both use lum in there team different mii's but same character
My one issue here is why does every Mii HAVE to be bi now?  Not saying people can't have the option, but what if there's a specific character that *shouldn't* be? No option for straight huh? A little bit of a double-standard there, Miitopia.
Of course it ends with Fleshy Fran and the Sephiroth music lmao
Always fun to go “ah crap that’s a town, I need to make more characters”
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who put their OC's in the game.
If there's one thing Miitopia has proved, it's that anyone can make their own fanfic adventure if given enough time and Miis. When I had the the game on 3DS, Gabe Newell was the true final boss while I was fighting alongside Guts, Guy Fieri and Hulk Hogan
As much fun as the character creator is I'm likely just going to have a big mish mash of fan fiction cause that sounds fun
This game is just an excuse for people to make their crossover idea's a reality let's be honest
Most people don't realize the mii music has always been great. Mii maker, wii sports, tomodachi life?? Bops all around.
Swag
The expanded character creation options are likely due to it being 1 player by default. Miis in general are more visible to others (I think) and thus they'd want to limit the options there to prevent people from 'corrupting the youths' with 'creative' faces.
I agree I hope to see Tomadachi Life ported as well
I want DLC, that add a hard mode/new game+ and new Classes/personalitys among more  mii customization
HE'S BACK!
I have never played miitopia, but I can safely say all the mii games are some of the most chaotic I’ve ever seen. Whenever I watch someone play it on YouTube, I always burst out laughing.
Is it strange how Nintendo makes really enjoyable games when they don't try?
i actually made my party members konosuba character and it fits so well
As somebody who played Miitopia on 3DS before it was cool, I must say this is a great port and the fact that it’s only $50 instead of $60 is really good. I hope that this game does well and Nintendo will realize “Oh hey, maybe making Ports $40-$50 instead of making them the same price as a brand new game is A better idea!”
"Miitopia side of salt?? More like Miitopia SIDE OF SUGAR" -ScottFalco
Miitopia is a great game, but the saddest change from the DS version is removing random character assignment.
There is a meta??
i played miitopia when it was new, on the 3ds
If there is anyone who knows how to get that Lum Mii, I have a friend who would love her in their party! Please!
It’s really fun to hear you talk about a game you like! (especially when it’s my favorite RPG of all time)
Where the fuck do i get a Miitopia and it's console, Wii?
POYO
I personally loved the 3ds version, though I wish there was slightly less RNG for the food items mainly due to the fact that there are achievements entirely based around getting certain stats raised high enough by food. Other than that it was just charming to me having various characters from different series interact in goofy way.
Sig is jealous of an anime waifu
So happy you liked it! This game was my childhood, and us Miitopians have been hiding in the shadows for years until now.
Do you have an access code for that Zero mii? Asking for a friend
Fleshyfran just wants a bite
Thank you so much, for the no salt
‘Dark Lord YanDev’  Good god, that fits so much
"How much meme material should we put in this game?" Nintendo: "Yes"
Hello I mad made Satan horse
Imagine getting jealous by a bobbing bish of a bot at the bottom of the screen
Funny how I also used yandev for my dark lord too
miitopia is just the result of nintendo downing a bucket of cocaine
Thank fuck, I'm not the only person that wants a Tomodachi life sequel.  Nintendo p l e a s e . I ask for just one freaking title from you.
Aw, how cute. I also thought Mii creators should just be like this, the basic ones seem so inferior now.
The true final boss of miitopia, the meat horse
It was a port that just worked.
after miitopia's release, people going hard on nintendo since they want a tomodachi revival on the switch I hope there will be a tomodachi life on the switch as well, even if it's just a remake.   also why can't that character creation be the actual mii creation, c'mon we'd have the perfect miis as mii fighters to beat each other with
More like 'Miitopia with a side of sugar'.
I don't like how similar Tessa looks to Pyrrha Nikos; it'll always be too soon for me.
This is a fairly faithful port to the Switch, however they did change the titles of the later relationships to be less romantic compared to the 3Ds version. Other than that it’s pretty much the same game but with the extra bits like the wigs and makeup
I play 3ds only and the all my level 50 characters are on it. And then they announce the switch. Well shit here we go again
I have played 3ds miitopia and saw so many new things in ur vid that i am 100% getting the game now, thx.
My great sage is literally the $19 fortnite card
Nice to see Lum getting some love. Brings me back to my younger days when I just got into anime. Great video!
5:13 he remembers what you did that summer........
1:38 I thought you could control the other characters in the 3ds version
So it's Miitopia with a seasoning of salt, then.
People not recognizing Lum, that is a bit...*sighs*
This is the one game where I could make a chad into a flower
F L E S H    H O R S E
Sig getting chucked by CC...never expected that in a mii game ima be honest
for anyone wondering, his outro music is from rhythm heaven ds
I made my cc a thief to XD
They gave a Mii game good music. That's awesome.
Miitopia’s jump from 3DS to Switch is like Smash 4’s jump from Wii U to switch. It’s the same mechanics, but they added enough from the original that it doesn’t seem like a cash grab
great video!!
Well, I already broke the first miitopia in half, might as well do it all over again.
Finally it is here
Chef life forever
A salt with no salt? Heresy
I can’t wait to see him get his ass kicked in the towers lol
This looks like your Mii's have more scenerios when interacting in this version.  1:46 Nice.  2:15 Yeah, even in the 3DS it was oddly fitting.
As someone who played the Demo on the 3DS (and decided it wasn't worth it) and now owns it on the Switch, it has been vastly improved. (Maybe not worth quite as much price-wise, but it is great.)
4:54  My time has come
Ok fine I'm getting the remake ok please I'm begging can this website stop shoving it in my face I feel bad about not having it I want to be a cool kid noooo
You're an awful person
I’m starting to regret not getting it on 3DS
Miitopia is rated R in Russia because you can have a gay relationship in the game
2:41 Sigcel
I didn't want to play Miitopia because the ads for it were so bonkers I had no idea what it was even supposed to be. I think I might try it now lol
I played the 3DS version and didn’t have half as much content shown in this video
As someone who really enjoyed the 3DS miitopia i wasnt really feeling this game especially at its price point but watching Polka (Oruka) stream of this has me sold they did more than just port the old game they put alot into the game but definitely alot of the fun comes from having your own silly characters and storylines plus its only $41 at Walmart for some reason
did you say dark lord yandev, that's amazing.
was that those chosen by the planet at the end
Im sorry but i had to pause the video at "Sig is getting cucked by CC!?", it was just to much  I frikin love you Scott.
When you so old no one knows who your Waufu is.XD
Yeah i love this game.
I remember playing this on 3DS and just fucking around with the miis trying to make the most horrifying things. It was so much fun, and I was so happy to realize that it's being released on the switch. Time to make some more fond memories
can someone tell me the music for when the flesh horse appears at teh end?
Fleshhorse pause zooms have been a guilty pleasure as of recently. Can't decide if its the music OR HIS AIM GETTIN BETTER that gets me everytime
5:41 fuck man, thats a good updated look for Booster. kind of want that access code! edit: was kind of hoping it would be in your access code, but more than half of the characters are locked so i guess thats that...
I mean if it makes u feel better scott, i know who lum is and im only 25
My biggest gripe was the fact that it just kinda flat out restarts your level and power 2 times forcing you to make a new party, id rather have my characters grow with one another throughout the adventure, especially since I worked so hard to design the original 3. I haven't finished the game yet, but its been hard to pick it up again because I just don't care about the new members if they're going to just take them away again.
Man, I'm not even a fan of turn based RPGs (that's not Pokemon) but I kinda want to give this game a try now.
Dear God I hated this game when I played it years ago on the 3ds
I did play it on the 3ds, and I still love playing it here. I like the additional features (the horse allows me to basically have my dog in the game) and the makeup/wigs are awesome and much needed. I will say, there is no reason to go back to the old game, but if you enjoyed it before you will enjoy this one too.
Miitopia salt   POGGERS   WAIT THIS IS SUGER   REAL SUGAR
Yey, some form of Sig and Tessa content
why is yandere dev being the dark load so fitting?
I hope they bring back Tomodachi Life with this Mii creator.
was that chapolin?
Apparently Tomodachi life is Tomodachi collection 2, Tomodachi Collection is a ds game exclusive to Japan which required the player to also own a wii because the ds had no mii maker, and played just like Tomodachi life, in other words Tomodachi Life and Earthbound both may have sequel that never left Japan
You didn't show us Stink!
But you gotta eat bananas and candy to upgrade them, *despite me only really doing this after I completed the game*
Your point about how the new mii maker system for the game should be the standard would be amazing just for smash alone but probably will kinda invalidate mii costumes
Oh god.....we're in the period where people don't know who Lum is.... I don't wanna get old!
I like how your Dark Lord is Yandere Dev
I expect flesh horse to become a recurring character.
Miitopia, AKA "Hey remember imagining all the cool stuff your OCs would do but lack the time and effort to make it happen? Here's your solution."
I've been on the fence about this title for so long that Nintendo released it a second time. Currently I'm struggling to start the demo because I can't figure out which adjective choice matches my personality the closest...
What makes me upset about this miitopia is this little pet peeve they should’ve made a squeal
this video is adorable
oh god what is the outro song
heh and the monsters are .... something
I am happy one of my favorite games didn't get roasted
Ya called?
I feel like the majority of people did not play it on the 3ds, so even though it’s still a port, it’s brand new for a lot of people
Miitopia is amazing and I hope they make the Miitopia mii maker the new maker for all miis in the future since it’s so much fun
It was kinda painful when everyone knows Ranma 1/2 but not Urusei Yatsura.
People that bought miitopia on the 3ds and it's on the switch now
SaS god tier weapon SS+
i actually cant believe we didnt see a twerky in the video
AH, yes, Hors Jail.
"Based on the Miitopia Meta, which is apparently a thing" It's pop stars. Pop stars are the meta. Put 2 in the same room in a party and they become absolutely broken. Don't listen to anyone trying to tell you otherwise. That's the entire meta.
So, one thing about this game that i love is this soundtrack. It's better than it has any right to be, and that's becuase it's made by the Rhythm Heaven people! And if you're heard the final boss theme, holy SHIET it goes hard!
*F L E S H   H O R S E*
im hoping if nintendo ever remembers tomodachi life was a game and they decide to bring it to switch they allow us to use this level of character customization again
Man I need to get this game.
As someone who played Miitopia on 3ds there seems to be a lot of changes here when it comes to character interactions. They used to always be confined to the same background/spot depending on what area you were in, so nothing like fishing or ocean side fun. Also I saw that they can go to a cafe which I don't think was in the original
Naughty miis get put in the horse jail to atone for their crimes
Now we wait for animated shorts based on their interactions.
One winged Fleshbulb.
Miitopia continues it's quirk of being absurdly good for almost no reason.
1:30 I know those two characters BOYFRIEND & girlfriend in FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN
I have arrived in regards to the portion of sodium chloride that you are providing
Sig and Tessa when? Kappa. I really enjoyed the characters you made so far and hope to see some animated stuff soon maybe? Big fan and keep up the good work!
honestly this game has been majorly improved on for the switch release with many new things like the improved character creator and horse.  As someone who played the 3ds version i recommend anyone to play the switch version :)
So... Where's the side of salt?
This was one of my favorite games on the 3ds
im glad to see that at least 1 person on the internet acknowledges urusei yatsura
I'm contemplating buying this game... AGAIN...
Failboat.
You hafta admit Miitopia on Switch is one of the coolest Remake/Port on Switch Nintendo either port/remake/sequelize Tomadachii Life on Switch
_Memetopia_
I now want to see a whole party of the konosuba cast
Ah yes, that old meme: "Bonk, go to H O R S E  J A I L"
Really more like a Pinch of Salt. Great work as always
Me before playing Miitopia: "There's no way that this silly little game could justify a this big price tag! There's no way it's gonna be worth it!"  Me after playing the demo: "This game is amazing and I can't take my hands off of it"
If this game let's me use Boyfriend speaking in Beep Bops, it is already the best game of all time
"I really hope a sequel to tomodachi life is announced" Should we tell him?
As someone who played the original. Horse is new and they added a lot of new events. Just, oh no, it gets more crazy
I would love Miitopia's character creation to become the standard. It has so much charm and flexibility.
The main bad guy in my playthrough is woke/cancel culture 🤣
Godammit, I've no money otherwise you'd have sold me on it.
Almost a million SUBS DOOOD!
This is what I subbed for
holy frick I forgot that your outro theme was remix 10 from rhythm heaven ds
I like how of all things we are appreciating miitopia, other developers aren't making any good games really
This looks so much better than the 3ds version
*_Uh Oh… Ataru likes Lum and saw it all…._*  *_Ataru is Jealous of Scott Falco_*
Ayo fuckinnnnn lum
It would be funny if each side of salt episode scott made would have more and more salt under him than the last episode.
I thought it would be a good idea while playing the demo to try to do accurate voices for all my characters. After about 2 hours my voice hurt from jumping between my voice, Dark Lord Bling Bling Boy's voice, and Jack Frost's voice. I will not buy the full game because I know I will not be able to stop myself from doing this and I value my vocal cords.
Hey skedadudlers
Flesh horse be scary. Flesh horse wants more. Flesh horse wants a taste. From you😱
Have you notice that your party's have a theme first your OC's then monster hunter
This game has completely made my fav games of all time list.
Played the 3ds version loved it switch version is announced *"WHAT"* intensifies
Dark lord YanDev and his evil army of if statements  He can only be defeated by mastering the legendary switch statement
How did you get this out so fast?
"There's a lot of boppin beats"  Oh just you wait till you fight the Dark Lord holy shit
I didnt see any salt though
1:50 my 2DS experience   XD
It’s such a pleasant surprise that this game made such a splash on Switch. I hope Nintendo notices and does the same with Tomodachi Life!
I have played it on the 3Ds and i still got it on switch, did not dissapoint
Seriously, the more I see of this game, the more I want to play it. LOL Especially after finding out the mii creator is crazy enough to allow the making of duchess from fosters. Who would make that abomonation? Why? DOnt knoww, but s.. It exists.
All this time and I still have no idea what is actually up with CC.  Anyone able to link me something that gives me a rundown on who or what she actually is?
So a lot of people don't know who lum is. Ok
Dam u have the same frist anime cursh  I loved that show
Lum is best girl!!😤 She deserves more love nowadays. Maybe an anime reboot🤔
This game revived miis on switch, which itself is good
Bruh Miitopia is an trip through fanart insanity and I love it
For me a tomadochii life sequel is my most wanted game on switch right now lol.
I’m thinking of doing a themed playthrough when I get the Switch version. I did an SMG4-themed playthrough of the 3DS version, and might reprise that playthrough on the Switch.
Demon Lord Yan-Dev is a big mood.
so that’s why miitopia is returning. i thought people just rediscovered the old 3ds one
My friends and I have all played it on 3DS and we all love the Switch Port of Miitopia. Any one of us would say it was worth the fifty
To be fair if you make all your mii's peter griffin it is a valuable experience
Nah chief all of my Mii in my party are oc except Mae Jameson and llama and didn't really screw around with custom creations it's funny building silly Miis
Honestly, this game is just so charming, which makes up for the relatively simple gameplay. And I too am praying that this was actually an experiment by Nintendo to see if they should put the effort into making a tomodachi life 2 for switch
I have replayed Miitopia on the 3DS 10 times.  I have been waiting for so long, it’s time...   Oh yeah I forgot I’m broke
YANDEV!
Personally, I *hate* Miitopia.  I played about an hour, then it got too physically painful to watch that mess. I don't even remember what personality I picked for my main Mii, but I can definitely tell that I didn't select "cringe" as personality, yet that's how he acted.  Anything that could've look relatively cool was completely undermined by that stupid face he made.  Plus, I basically had 0 agency in the entire game.
Who's Tessa and sig?
This game really makes mii smile
played the ds version, would definitely play the switch one. its really enjoyable and the upgrades makes the game even more worth playing
Just NEVER FIGHT THE TWERKY
Scott: CC, use swipe! CC: Ok I’ll eat MP candy and set a one time trap. Scott: *NYYYAAAAAAAAA-*
Sunnovabish Scott! I had 0 interest in this game. 0 INTEREST!
HOW COULD SOMEONE NOT KNOW WHO LUM IS?!?!?
*Thank you for bringing representation to my beloved “Me as the hero, my perfectly made OCs as the party members” playstyle*
The whiplash of seeing that Galactic Nova mii near the beginning. Mine’s a lot simpler, but also doesn’t break when doing expressions, so there’s that at least. All my party members were Kirby characters(and fan characters…), but npcs were kinda just anything goes. Except the roaming gourmet, he had to be Guy Fiery. My main mii was the Lor Starcutter because, well, I Just Think They’re Neat. Hence my icon that I drew myself.   Sorry for rambling, I am on pain medication and unfortunately it makes me very ramble-y.
So uhhh... Scott... when CC getting R34'd?
I ALSO MADE A FLESH HORSE WITH THICC BODY AND LEGS, but i gave it yellow hair and called it goku
When you also self inserted in the 3D edition, but made your own characters to fight along side you:
I loved the stream so much
Should consider actually naming cc instead of using that kinda lazy stand in.
OOOOH HE HAVE EL CHAPULIN COLORADO JAJAJAJA THATS A HONOR JAJAJA
Its incredible how Miitopia is that popular now, it wasn´t too much popular when it was released.
Miitopia is such a great game. I've played it I think 3 times so far, but always stopped at the final boss (no spoilers, guys). Each time has been amazing! This game is so spectacular in every regard I cant even give it justice with words.  I'm yet to play the switch version, but im sure its amazing as well.
Making characters jealous was actually kinda funny when I was playing the game-
There is but 1 thing bad about this game and yes it’s the entire enemy lineup of the twerkey.
Before this remake this game was excellent but underrated barely anyone remembered this game. I'm so glad this is back and I totally need that Palico Mii from ya. Hoping for more Mii content on the switch since they've never been used until now
The one and only Nintendo game to have an 18+ rating for not implementing a restriction on which gender can like each other.   And it it got a pretty neat remake. What a time to be alive
Dang dude haven't seen you this happy in YEARS!
It’s like jello apocalypse but with more animation
"From a handheld came to a home console"  Say that again. It went from a weak handheld to a slightly less weak handheld.
0:23 el chapulín colorado! I guess Scott wasn’t counting on his cunning
I have the 3DS version and I still trying to complete it.
It’s like jello apocalypse but with out the animation
Finally someone who knows Urusei Yatsura! Your ending dance already gave away that you at least know the 2nd opening! Adding Lum just shows that you have great taste!
Ive played the 3DS title, and this looks far more interesting...
Why is it that everyone agrees telepathically to announce DK as the mayor
Who is Scott's anime crush. Asking for a friend
Why the heck are people complaining about switch ports Its good games being ported to a new system so more people can enjoy it I get complaining about ports of bad games  But this is a good port
Miitopia the anime
I remember playing this on the 3DS the normies can now experience this masterpiece of a game lol
Miitopia is fire tbh
The return of the king
So why not have an official Mii channel on switch then?
"Uh-oh. Sig likes Tessa and saw it all..."  *GG NINTENDO*
I hope they keep going forward with mii games in the future. There’s so much potential and charm with them that would be a shame to just stop useing them. And I really want Tomodachi life 2.
This is the most we will see of Sig and Tessa
YEAH LUM WAS MY FIRST ANIME CRUSH TOO
More like side of sugar
I'm glad that you liked mh rise so much that you get hinoa and minoto in your party xD even the palico
What’s flesh horses name
So cool
I wanna get this game so bad. JUST TO MAKE ALL OF MY TEAM MEMBERS ANIME CHARACTERS.
Ngl i can tell this game is so healthy for you, always nice to see ya happy
The cc mom looks good
Miitopia Character creator makes up for the Switch’s lack of joyful energy. It’s so empty and dry compared to the Wii/WiiU
I think Scott found his favorite game.
Yeah. The games is really fun.
I played like 75 hours of miitopia for the 3ds and I’m really happy for the switch port
i’ve played 3ds miitopia and there was hardly a community, but now that its been ported to switch, the game has blew up. seeing that just puts a smile on my face.
I 100 percented the original 3ds game
ok hear me out: the switch’s ui is aggressively bland. we’re probably getting the switch pro announcement before e3. what if we got a massive ui update alongside the switch pro’s release, with miis and themes and stuff? i can dream at least
As some one who played the 3ds Version I wasn't sure what they would change about it. I thought them porting it would lose some of its charm and yet it didn't. In my opinion I feel it has some better charm. But it feels more easier than the 3ds version
I would like to point out that Miitopia is a pretty niche game that, if you're not interested in, you tend to stay the heck away from. I bring this up because saying "no salt because chat's been goodest they've ever been" is a pretty biased pool to get opinions from. It's like going to a concert and asking people if they like the artist. As someone who isn't a fan of these cutesy, simple, "OMG to pure fow dis sinfuw wowold" games, I really couldn't care less. I'm glad people are liking it, but really? It's like praising a children's show. It might be a fine show, but I've outgrown such simple stories. I'm looking for more than just "Haha! He looks like a *insert unfunny meme or anime character*! That's all I need to experience happy!" There's your salt.
I'm actually really happy that Sig and Tessa are still somewhat talked about. I really hope one day you get to keep working on that because I found it really interesting!
Me: time to use this videos code to get some miis *The miis I desire are blocked* Me:... well ****
Bruh ive been playin the 3DS since summer started I love it sm kyrzzetjsetj
Sadly I feel the game getting boring because I just got a bit numb to the funny factor.  But yes.... Why were Mii's not this creative a Wii U ago?!  Would have made them more fun to use in Sm4sh and Ultimate.
I played miitopia on the ds and lived it, but the switch version added next to nothing so I didn't buy it.
id love to be able to customize my miis on tomodachilife like that id be on my ds for almost a whole day
I will say this: The endgame’s so forcibly drawn out.
Miitopia is fun and I like it.
As someone who played the 3ds version, the switch version is 100% worth it
i want to see fanart of the  *F Le sH hOR siE*
I think we all agree the one thing this is missing is a PVP mode.
not a side of salt but a pinch of sugar.
Finally, some recognition after 6 years! Love you Scott! also yes miitopia is best game and yes our subreddit and fanbase are one of the most wholesome i've ever seen Edit: the music was made by the same guy that did splatoon music fyi
4:42 S N U R P
This is the only reason I like having amiibos for this version and the 3ds also tip cool is one of the most powerful stats more crits and dodges
Miitopia is the most well behaved chat By any chance do you not know who failboat is
i miss the spotpass feature
I played the 3ds game and I legitimately forgot how fun it was until I played the new game
Makes me wish to see the whole adventure honestly and your stream of it. They all look pretty great.
this wasn't a side of salt this was like 3 grains of salt
This game is legit too fun to hate
"Perfect if you have OCs and want to see them go on goofy adventures" That's literally why I bought the game 💀
Miitopia is awesome and I’m glad this game got remade
I have 150+ hours in the 3DS version and beat the Switch version 5 days after it came out, so it's cool seeing it getting so much attention as a huge fan of it.
"It's like when you get a piece of fan art and get all choked up" Ah yes, because all the non influencers, that don't get gifts from people for attention, watching these videos know exactly what that's like.
Flesh horse is best boy
4:30 I see you're a man of culture as well...
I played the 3ds version and had tons of fun playing it, so I was hyped for the switch remake, and was not disappointed
Tomodachi with this character creator will be a nightmare.  Please give me.
HE DIDNT DRAW THE MEGA MAN!?
I'm currently playing miitopia and at one point I cried because of the horse
I was hoping, just hoping there would be a quick Fleshyfran/Sephiroth music  clip in there.  You did not disappoint!
Crossing my fingers that Miitopia's popularity brings the great comeback of the miis
Are you still thinking of making a sig and tessa show?
My mii is a Mage who hates Attack and Magic foods. Which is just perfect.
I'm a simple man  I see Lum, I press like 😁
POG
Do you have the full game
I wish they made Miitopia multiplayer. I think it would be cool if each of your friends controlled there Mii instead of just doing whatever they want.
2:00 HAHAHAHAHA
TOMODACHI 3!
i have Miitopia on the 3DS and      man i wish it had the mii creator lol
I remember having a tank that was the fastest of my team, in the nintendo ds
Idc what u say but miitopia is the best game ever
The flesh horse beckons thee...
Stand user: Scotty Falcon Stand name: A.P.O.S. (A pinch of salt) Abilities, able to produce an seemingly unlimited amount of salt around the user or at high speeds ranging up to Mach 1.4 able to do significant damage to mostly everything.
The horse bit genuinely made me laugh
The combat reminds me of persona 3 Gotta love marin karin instead of literally any other fucking move which would kill that turn :/
Still dislike miis, they just did a bad job with designing them. None if the avatars the major consoles had you make looked even remotely good aside from playstation's, and those were just generic spiderman npc's at the end of the day. Maybe if they overhauled the entire system or redid the heads and made them less bulbous, it wouldn't look as bad
Horse SCP
Someone has probably already created their own Senior Koquonfaes, Im sure.
The only critic I have on the game is the removal of all the random miis. In the 3DS version, if you were connected to the internet, the miis in towns and other locations were completely random picked from other users who uploaded their miis online. Now, in the switch version, you have to manually choose these miis, which kinda ruins the surprise value a little bit. I would prefer to walk into town and be surprised that Ugandan Knuckles and shrek are dating, rather than walk into town knowing this because I had to hand pick them
I feel like a sequel to Tomadachi (yes I know I miss spelled it) would only really be announced to be going into development. Miitopia is the kind of game I would guess is a test to see if interest in miis are still up. If they add a similar character creator a sequel/remake would be successful.
Again why the "ara ara" for one of the sisters in monster hunter stop making me hate a game I already love so much
I played the 3ds version it gets alot harder trust me
EVERYONE CHARACTER THAT ISN'T A MAIN CHARACTER IS ME IN MY SAVE THEY CAN NEVER ECSCAPE
Good fun
Lum!
As someone who’s been a fan of Miitopia before it was even annouced as an international release for 3DS, I’m so happy that it’s come out on Switch and has suddenly exploded into a big thing on YouTube, Twitch, and all the other stuff. I’m proud of the little 3DS title growing into a big lad.
‘Miitopia meta’ Me, who made a team of only cats:
I played the 3DS version but this makes it look like a completely different game
4:44 you just described Konasuba
I remember a battle I had back when I played on DS  I was fighting some boss, a dragon I think? My party all had high relationship which added two main relationship things. One being not giving up, and getting back up when you reach 0hp, and the other being extra damage when someone who you have high relationship  dies.  Insert everyone dying, getting back up and doing high damage before dying again.  We literally couldn’t lose
LUM THE INVADER GIRL I see you 👀
It's crazy that in the first two weeks of its release its outsold the 3ds by 3 times
You oughta change the title of this video to Pinch of Salt
The flesh horse gives me.. horror
3:58 GOEMON!? Haven't seen him in any game in years.
Frenzy horse. That is all
"Miitopia with a Side of Salt" No salt in video "Miitopia with a Side of Sugar"
Stop horsin' around!
I have both versions of Miitopia..Being a Veteran..
What would that sequel be? Tomodachi Death?
miitopia, aka the newest way for CC to be a bitch
1:00 ZEERO for smash
Just ate the SALTIEST fries in the world.       that's it that's the comment
I had the 3ds version (but never beat the final boss because i lost my ds for literally 2 years 👀) and now i have the switch version. I have changed so much since I played it first and with my newly established ✨art brain✨combined with the makeup feature i've been having so much fun, even if I know what happens. Is it worth 50 dollars? Well.. maybe not if you played the 3ds version, but if you loved the game on 3ds and want more or if you missed the 3ds release, I do recommend it.
As a miitopia 3ds player THIS IS WORTH IT IF YOU HAVE THE 3DS VERSION
This went form Miitopia with a side of salt to a game review of it and then talking about Mii’s in general. What an incredible video.
Is it a stupid game? Yes. However it is surprising funny for a modern Nintendo game
Wait,you have others ocs than cc???
Yandere Sig  Yandere Sig
I saw more content than in the DS version I might get it.
i got the biggest smile on my face when i saw this video ive been a huge fan of this game since i bought it on 3ds, and i’m so glad that more people have been getting the chance to play it now that it’s on switch
"Your new powers should help you contend with Yanderedev" What is there to contend with
Hey falco care to make more lewd CC art? Google search bar has been on the same results for a while now
Watching the stream was pretty funny! ~Consume Flesh~
Fortnite with a side of salt, dont worry i wrote the script: fuck this game and if you play it youre cringe. Thats it thats the whole script
All hail Fleshfren!
As a guy who played the original game on 3DS, I can confidently say that this game is a massive improvement from the first game, albeit with very little changes to the story and such (although I haven’t gotten to Karkaton yet so maybe there’ll be some changes) my main gripe with the game is that, for a guy that likes to 100% every level (as in, explore every path, open every chest) it can be a massive slog, still a fantastic game though
This game would be so much better if it had permadeath for your miis and the other miis had to deal with the trauma
Wait holy shit that’s an amazing Lum Mii! Gonna need to find (or make) an Ataru one
I would like a tamidachi life sequel
Princess Luigi!
wait. This wasn't with a side of salt! It's with a side of sugar! p e r f e c t
Yuo*
I'm just saying, tomodachi life might just be tamagotchi, but god damn was it a good tamagotchi, and now imagine that with miitopia mii maker
i was honestly a little sad when i realized there was a switch version because i've been grinding my party of four for several years on the 3ds but if i want to play the improved version of the game i'll probably have to give them up
I loved this game on 3DS when it first came out. My only gripe with the original is that if you wanted to play from the start again; you had to erase your one save of it. But with this port; that's no longer an issue. Also the improved Mii maker gives so many more options for characters. I love it!
oh cool he made a MiiTopia with a Side of Sa... ER AIM IS GETTING BETTER!    HER AIM IS GETTING AIM IS GETTING AIM IS GETTING AIM IS GETTING  AIM IS GETTING BETTTER 1:30
It's honestly just good fun with no real point to it.
finally a youtuber that gives his acces code, thanks man, if only failboat would do this
I played miitopia on the 3ds and when I saw it was getting such a huge expansive update for the switch I got excited.
as someone who played the 3DS version, I can say this is still worth the buck. I can make much more fleshed out character looks, the jokes still get to me, the outing's something new to look into (and a few fanfic moments), and horse does horse things.
Miitopia is the baseline of deciding if im going to be called a furry or god because cat has destructive levels of DPS
Lum was you first crush? A man or culture, i see
Actually it would be a third tomodatchi life it gets announced since the first one came out on the DS. The second game for the 3Ds was the one they decide to give the western audience.
Finally a game where he dose not actually have negative criticism to it
i played the 3ds one and it was fun im so glad people finding it
as someone who has played the 3ds version and only saw the switch one, the switch port looks a lot better
there's meta?
Flesh horse
So less a side of salt and more a pinch?
:0
First played this game on the 3ds and it was definitely worth it to play it again on the switch.
The palico mii tho, so cute. (This is Mike's daughter btw)
I was probably one the first thousand people to buy miitopia on the 3ds and I had no clue the "miitopia meta" was a thing
I played the 3ds version and they changed it up to the point where it is still fun and interesting but still the same game
It's a surprisingly comfy game tbh, I've been enjoying the hell out of it too. I'm kinda hoping we get more "Mii" games like a sequel to this and Tomadachi Life because they're way better than you'd think they have any right to be.
...? Nice video... ...but where's the salt ?
I have an unholy amount of hours in miitopia 3ds. It is the game with the most hours played on my 3ds, I’d just have it running in the background while watching YouTube. The tower of dread is actually a decently difficult endgame too. Seriously recommend people pick it up.
Finally, a horse to rival Butt Stallion
YESS
say Kevin for good luck... IM BACK BOIS
Fully completed miitopia on the 3ds, but man the better mii creator alone is worth it to play it again
5:12 Couldn't end it off without this, huh?
41034th
This is my animal crossing. XD
Nothing beats Princess Majima Change my mind
My little brother is the guy that made MR BEES
“That would make the game even easier than it is."  i cant wait for him to get to the post-game
Egg Whites
Hehehe, the funny
Is it me or did this video feel too light hearted, like you were expecting a bit of ranting but there isn't any. Then again it's hard to take this game seriously
I try my best to avoid memeing the hell out of the game with a couple of exceptions like making the Gourmet Bob Ross and the wimpy Noble Boy Morty  With my fantasy story in the works I have been experimenting with the Mii maker and trying to recreate my Crovtia characters with fitting roles like my main villain Zarlost being the dark lord or my dragon sisters as the Fab Fairies  And if I have characters who don’t fit in certain roles I just create a new character from scratch like the Genie, King, and Princess   As for my team, I enjoy making my first team my closest friends then use OCs from things other than Crovtia for the rest of my teams  Back when I had the 3DS version I loved having one joke character named Gerald the Flower and I loved how much I improved his look in this new port!  This game was so much fun the first time on 3DS, and now the switch port has given me a fantastic fresh start with new features that bring more charm and laughs onto the table  10/10
Imagine the horse in this video as major moon in Zelda.
The vid shows why people have meta going for the game.  Pretty sure thief is usually preferred to be a PC played class given how varied the moveset is, while something like the fighter is perfect for your NPC buddies to use since he mostly sticks to just hitting one enemy per turn.
MIITOPIA WITH A SIDE OF SALT YEAH
The battles are easy? Boi just wait til the post-game lmao
The "Mii Team" at Nintendo is real good at making dumb charming games, hopefully they get more things to pour their time into making after everyone fell in love with this
HIS AIM IS GETTING BETTER
your horse looks like he's made of clay
1:24 - "Dark Lord Yandev"  Perfect name, 10/10
Wow, Madlibs sure have taken a turn
4:34 "Who dat?"....   Just kiddin' I used to watch Urusei Yatsura when I was a kid too and also Ranma 1/2, both made by the same author. Shampoo is bae.
Appease the algorithim!
I've loved miitopia since it came out. The 3DS one was somewhat good but I feel the switch one is just as you said oozing with charm the outings made me smile so much when I can see my teammates bond more in such more human like ways..well sorta. The horse is honestly kinda broken in some parts due to the horse whisper. Also uh yes there is a tier list. The uh well it's spoiler.           The after game classes Elf and Vampire are broken as heck.
I still haven't finished the 3ds version, its very similar but with worse character creation and no horse
if I had this game out most probably done it with every single murderers from history and movies and just see what the interactions will be with each other.
Miitopia is a lot of fun  It’s the only place where your memey dreams can come true. Do you want a party consisting of Waluigi, Sans, Goku and the Great Mighty Poo? You can totally do that, all while helping the morbidly obese King Peter Griffin
Let’s be honest, it’s not a port if you never got to experience the original. That’s why I’m not upset with the Switch kinda being a Wii U port machine because I only played 4 Wii U games. The same reasoning applies to my feelings towards Skyward Sword HD and the *hopefully* ports of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess HD
The 3ds one was my favorite out of all those free games that came with the handheld. I might have to pick this up.
I own miitopia for the 3DS got it when it first came out, and have been watching people play the switch version. The story looks the same, but with a few extras and a way better character creator, so I don't know if I want to buy it again, but its a good game.
urusei yatsura!! I knew I recognized the salt dance from somewhere.
As someone who played the 3DS version The character creation alone makes the port worth it, it's absolutely amazing (i haven't finished though, only got to the desert land on switch, got all the way to post game on 3DS) And for anyone who hasn't played either version There is a lot more than you would expect, and a LOT of post game --like a ridiculous amount--
THE BEST PART IS???? (IDK IF THIS COUNTS AS SPOILERS BUT WHATEVER) U CAN MAKE UP TO A TOTAL OF 1 0 0 CHARACTERS?????? LIKE WOOOOOOO NELLY
i love this game
My therapist:princess Luigi isn’t real he/she can’t hurt you. Me:3:51
Mii maker in this game needs to be the switch's primary custom tool for your Mii's, and we need more Mii based games to have more fun with them cause smash bros. can only take me so far, and Miitopia's price is a little overwhelming for me since I seen the gameplay. But overall a new Mii game would be more fantastic with the inclusion of Tomodachi life 😊
Meanwhile, you got people like me fighting against Dr. Coomer with the likes of Starfire; Bakugou; Midna and Cream the Rabbit.
As someone who played the 3ds version waaaaay too many times, this is easily among the best switch ports we've gotten in terms of content and price
We just need a way of setting which facial features are suppised to be animated and which ones are the main ones and Nintendo made a better character creator than the sims Or cyberpunk
It's funny to think I thought I was original with my idea for a horse made of skin
I'm glad Miitopia released on the Switch, more people can finally play it and see how funny and fun it can be, made even better thanks to the new features! Too bad that I missed the streams, but I'm glad to hear that Scott enjoyed the game. Fingers crossed for Tomodachi Life to be ported!
Omg LUM! <3
yeah ive gotten far and your in for a fuckin treat  and a bit for sadness but thats besides the point
I have only played the demo but my sister beat the 3ds one and it is more of a let's see what happens next kind of game, I wouldn't have it any other way
Come on 1 mil!! Your so close dude
POV: the horse is jealous of your relationship
I freaking love this game.
I like to think of this as a family friendly nintendo version of persona 3, though without any real-life japanese elements and no social links, persona fusing, etc. Yes, I say that because the combat is similar to persona 3, without tactics or being able to swap abilities during your turn
Seeing them again, when is Sig and Tess coming back?
did miitopia get a remake?
This looks to be one of the greatest games in history, and I dont have it.... I dont have a switch at that matter.
Zero mega man zero zero wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I would of said some this game was a 7 out of 10 because of the kind of basic battle system, but because the demo lets me say "me, Charlie from hazbin, bf from fnf, and sans from undertale have to save peter Griffins face from dio" i give it a 10/10
As someone who played the original 3DS release of Miitopia I think the switch remake is so incredibly amazing
I heard dancing mad
Its like the switch but way worse quality
Fun fact, the custom hair/eye colors that were introduced in the switch version of the Mii Maker were actually first made in Miitopia 3DS. This stands to reason that on whatever console Nintendo makes next, the wig and highly detailed character creator stuff here has a good chance of being put into the regular Mii Maker too. After the positive reception, I really hope it is anyway.
*Florse watches eternally*
nobody: my cousins looking for games on my phone:  5:12
I will say watching the stream when that last F L E S H H O R S E experience was hilarious. For those who dont know, Scott pulled a one over on chat and made us think the stream crashed and then jump scared us.
miitopia is such a creative wonderful game. one of my favourite games and i hope we get a tomodachi port. i played miitopia a few months on release on the 3ds and it was one of the games i had the most hours on
Nice
Day 2 of commenting till scott plays one step from eden
I remember playing the original game on the DS. Well actually I could never find my DS because my little sister kept stealing it to play miitopia and I would always find it in her room but you get the point.
1:32 BUT HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER
Lum! Yay!!!
Im so happy that miitopia is getting the Recognition it deserves
Protips for newcomers from a crazed obsessor (slight spoilers for surprising moments so if you want to go in blind i suggest you ignore this):   1) You can press and hold B to speed up BASICALLY EVERYTHING. Very useful for repeat playthroughs and the like.   2) When you run into rare and very rare snurps, use your hyper sprinkles, they increase the damage done on those things from 1 to 3 and they have 5 health, so its a good way to earn easy exp. They can be found somewhat frequently on the hidden path/level left of the final boss, on the "snurp" path of course, and they are found in groups of 3 very rare&2 rare or (i think) just 8 rare provided good luck, so its an effective grind spot.   3) Dont bother with RockPaperScissors, i find it much more beneficial to just wait until you get good spinner (or whatever its called) as typically it gives you armour, and you can either equip it or sell it and armour typically goes for MUCH more than 500/1000 gold later on.   4) Fiend enemies only ever take 1 damage from all magic attacks besides bat swarm, so if you have a party of primarily magic users, give them hyper sprinkles if you have them, and also put shield sprinkles on members that are important such as cats and clerics; since their main attack is a one-hit kill.  5) If you're thinking of adding a tank (as in actual tank, it is a class) to your party, i suggest a pop-star as well since Tanks often cause friendships to break; which pop-stars can heal at any time.  6) There's a hidden boss rush in the post-game, and you have to spare the Dark Curse to unlock it.  7) in the first world, dont enter the cave level until most other bosses are done, as the banshee enemies are VERY strong.  8) If you're ever told theres a hidden path, TAKE IT. They often hide high-end foods and armour.  9) In the second world, when asked between the risky and safe paths early on, choose the safe path. The risky path has a piece of armour but it's guarded by two griffins, so dont come back till towards the end of the world  10) In the post-game unlocked island and later districts of NewLumos, dont enter the deep part (or whatever its called) until about level 40, as the enemies there are RIDICULOUSLY STRONG.  Edit: the game is a great port and the makeup system is completely new to the switch version, along with the horse, outings and probably a few things, and i havent even gotten the full game yet. So even if you played this on 3DS, i still highly recommend it. DEFINITELY a great example of how an enhanced port should be, and just disgraces other lazy ports like SkywardSword even more.
Your access key is
I'm surprised there isn't one that is just a salt shaker.
My poor boy Sig getting cucked by CC, what a great game this is
I think I said something like this when you stopped doing Overwatch, but this video makes me want to say it again.  I love Overwatch (yes, still) so I was sad you stopped. But I also prefer your videos when you actually enjoy what you're making. And this video is the perfect example. Love your stuff Scott. Keep it up, and stay happy. <3
101% Agree with the wishes of a sequel to tomodachi life!
The one bad thing about this game is not carrying over the Mii Central feature, without a massive database of Miis, I'm gonna have to go searching. Or, I dunno, might just try and recreate every Mii I had randomly put into the 3DS version. Everything else is pretty stellar, and honestly I'd happily call it one of the best RPGs of recent years because of how just fun it is.
can we talk about how accurate cc is both personality and design wise.
I have the 3DS one, and I l’m not getting the switch Miitopia
The encounters are not random it will always be the same enemy at a specific point in a stage
Scott: just use the blades move and we can easily win  CC: spinny door go spinny weeeeeweeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Stop showing us that abomination or I will make it a part of Exdeath’s castle!
The character creator is to good, nintendo is confusing.
I will say as someone who played the 3ds version that switch version is the definitive way to play this game... Especially with the creator, the outings, the horse interactions, and the new additions to the postgame content. They removed the ability to make special little comic strip style snipets of your Miitopia screenshots, and for some reason when the roving photographer shows up after a major boss that has a unique gimmick ability, the mid-turn battle menu is captured in the photos he takes if it's up and it sometimes ruins them... But that's only minor gripes
Miitopia with a Side of Nut
Mmmm  HUMAN CANNON BALL FRACK U HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
The Miitopia Mii Maker is what broke the internet ^^;
Miitopia's meme potential is so stupidly high that it would be a waste if people didn't capitalise on it.
Lol what's the miitopia meta? I just ran 4 warriors
I have waited for this for a long time, 10/10 Scott
This should have been callled "Miitopia with a pinch of salt"
oh god i remember playing this in 2016 on the 3ds. I think i played for abt a year
I’ve been looking for something like this and I never knew it existed. I’m getting it
Sig gets cucked by cc, the feature length film.
Tomodachi life 2 should be able to have your characters from miitopia in it and the other way around. Edit: now it exists we will see…
I did play the 3DS one and the switch one and I think the switch one is objectively better (in my opinion) and was a good port
Flesh is weak, Sig.
why do i feel like we're going to see that horse again
finally everyone can create the waifu of their dreams
miitopia: it's the mii channel on crack
So just a heads up since there seems to be confusion, you can download other people's miis and use them, you don't have to make all of them yourself unless you want to
In the 3ds game you dont have 2 thing : the horse and stock mii inside the game the rest is in the original game.
Honestly I find it hard to write a catchphrase that isn't "I eat children" and I don't know why
2:51 that's one sentence I didn't expect you to say, ever. You just give more fuel to rule 34 artists!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD OCs!
Zero suit Scotts 'bout to make me act up, ngl
I remember trying to 100% it until I realized I would have to get all classes including the unlockable ones to level 50 and there is about 20
I think you'd like Fire Emblem
How can people not recognize Lum!? The first of the anime waifus!
Ye
Personally, I love Urusei Yatsura, and it saddens me that people don’t know what it is.
Im so glad that nintendo remade Miitopia, it introduced so many people to this amazing 2017 game.
As someone who played the original, the price is honestly a friggin steal. You get updated graphics, brand new in depth customization, and H O R S E, it's well worth the extra 10 bucks
I played and finished the 3DS version and LOVED IT. I even pre-ordered the remake and downloaded the demo. I made my horse a tall cutie named Friia. I hope my friend who doesn't have a credit card can buy a physical copy if they make them.
Okay here is my story of Miitopia. I played the 3DS Version right when it was released. I liked this game a lot and finished it, but one thing was missing. Friends. I didn't had any friends at this time of my life. I was alone and nearly every day I was depressed because of it. Now my life feels so much better, meeting so many great people around me that I love to call friends. It felt so good to finally play this game again and put actually friends inside, going around this game world and have a funny adventure with me. Maybe the game itself didn't change much, but the feelings I have for this game grew so much stronger. So I really hope Nintendo releases more Miigames like this or Tomodachi life.
Please for the love of God release your playthrough of the game
Oh hey it's the fucking douchebag falcon
Miitopia it's Mine Of Gold and Cursed Stuff  Even CC looks Cool here Also Scott
thats horse is nightmare fuel
I wanna have tomadachi life moved to the console, it’d be honestly great! If they allowed miitopia like character creation, it’ll be a good sell most properly!
miitopia with a side of salt, more like miitopia with a side of sugar
You've created a Lum mii??? I fucking need it right now!
When you get Cucked by a robot cat girl
2:13 oddly fitting dialogue... *flashbacks to my definitely-not-stolen-from-any-game Chara mii wanting to buy a toy knife, and an OC who is addicted to learning things reading every book in a library and literally breaking into a museum to study
No stream archives?
I grew up on 3ds tomodachi life 2 when
the rhythm heaven music at the end makes me happy as a big rhythm heaven fan
CC looks amazing
Huh, your take on it piques my interest. If/when it goes on sale maybe I'll pick it up.
1:47 is so  True
Sir you have uploaded your vid at the exact same time as an amogus vid you susy baka
Miitopia is one of my favorite games, but I'll admit its gets pretty repetitive later in the game. You see the same interactions 10+ times when grinding for the late game or post game content. I found myself holding B to speed things up constantly. I played the 3DS version, and the Switch port exists in the "Adds something new but not enough to justify purchasing and playing the game a second time" category, which I DESPISE.
My entire team absolutely hates goblin ham
Why does that one OC of yours remind me of Pyrrha from RWBY?
Hmm….are you sure it’s a side of salt and not a pinch of salt? Or maybe a side of sugar? After all, you said it yourself that there’s not much salt to be had here :)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I'm glad this game got a second chance on the Switch. I always loved the 3DS version, and the only reason I felt that it wasn't as popular as it could have been was because... well, it came out THE SAME YEAR as the Switch. I'm just honestly happy that people are enjoying the game. Heck, on the Switch store page, Miitopia was (at least at the time of this comment) more purchased on the Switch than both Among Us and Minecraft. Miitopia to me truly is the little game that could, and I am so proud of it. I do hope you have fun playing through the rest of the game!
As soon as I see Grunkle Stan on screen I just hear "YOUR AIM IS GETTING BETTER" echoing in my head.
That's the thing about Mii games, they always have perfectly fitting scenarios
I had the Phantom Thieve's as my party members and everyone was getting jealous of everyone spending time with Joker. Meanwhile, Joker is just there like "...f*ck"  Oh. Also, I had the Velvet twins and Lavenza as the Fab Fairies and even edited the Lavenza mii to her superior form: DOUBLE EYEPATCHES!!!
Don't forget that this was rated 18+ in Russia because your characters can be gay
My sides hurt from laughter
THEY DIDNT RECOGNIZE LUM?!? Damn I guess no one watches Urusei Yatsura anymore. Anyone wanna check it out the whole thing is on youtube
I absolutely loved the enemy and food design as well And yes i shamelessly used this indeed, as an OC focussed RPG
Why did you stop making sig and tessa?
nice
Hey, Miitopia player on the 3ds here. The original game was honestly really good, but it definitely felt lacking in some areas, mainly the 'Only equip stats' button wasn't a thing, so to keep a cosmetic set, you had to go to the menu to change appearance anytime you got new gear. The customization was also limited, but not as limited as pre-switch mii maker, since you had access to unnatural hair colors. Miitopia honestly deserved a remake on switch, and is, in my opinion, well worth it's price tag.
The game was in 2016 what
Honestly my Miitopia play style is as the onlooker. I set my character to auto and fast forward most battles, and then focus on sprinkles and safe space stuff. It feels more like "I am keeping this party safe" instead of "My team is dumb as rocks"  Because if everyone is dumb, no one is
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: nothing is scarier than when Miitopia accidentally makes your Miis act in character.  Edit: Everytime I get a notification that someone replied to this post I smile. I love reading everyone's stories and personal experiences with this game. Keep them coming.
With such an extended Mii creation system, I still wish for one thing from Nintendo : A Nintendo MMORPG with the Miis as the characters you play as, with the same creation system than this game. It could be legitimately a big game. But not just that I think the main genre of online games could potentially work with something like that
I didn't want to get it because I thought it was kinda dumb buying this game twice but this was a full fuckin remake so imma probably pick this up
I literally beat the 3DS title for the second time a few hours before watching this
How could you not put CC as the Pop Idol. We need
tomodachi life and dragon quest 9 remake are all i need now
Great Sage Goemon. Amazing xD
Almost at 1 million hope you get there by the end of this month 👍
Miitopia is the holy grail for artists like me, i love watching my ocs go on adventures and pair up, it's stupidly fun and oddly enough the dialogue really fits some of them.
"MP candy?" What? NO! "I'm already eating it." LMAO
To be honest, your horse looks more like a moving sand sculpture
Damn...Came here hoping to add some salt to my burger but joy it's just bland...Is this game really worth getting a switch for? Probably not, I will never support Nintendo!
I wasn't ready for the horse at the end
I wish that Nintendo would fully flesh out the Mii Plaza games so they would work without Streetpass and for more content. I mean, imagine Find Mii if it had interactions where you would become friendlier and be able to recruit someone more often.
Miitopia game of the year
Skin horse skin horse
As someone who played the original for years and had it as my comfort game for a long while (easily spend 100 hours into it XD) I can confidently say.  Holy shit this remake is so much better, the character creator is a blast, the horse...well is the horse and the outings are a lovely new mechanic. I didn't hesitate paying the price for it since it wasnt 60 and also the graphics and general look improved so much I just cant ;-;  Basically if you never played miitopia, go get it. If you have and the new features seem fun, go get it.  Also it's really fun how my tastes has changed since I was 14 to 16 until now that I'm 18. Like several things have changed, ranging who was in my parties to who the great sage and the evil lord was. (Hello there great sage shrek and dark lord megamind)
low key would love to see some Sig & Tessa animations
So this is just turned based Happy Wars
Miitopia side of salt?? More like Miitopia SIDE OF SUGAR
I could kinda understand people not liking it for being a port but the advanced avatar creator extremely makes up for it its super fun to see funny and familiar faces from your OC to a horse made out of flesh the game is awesome
I played the 3DS version, I noticed some things like the horse and some of the scenarios they get put in are new, but it's generally the same. The character creator in the 3DS was also inferior since it was on a less powerful system. I think I might buy it for the switch.
Heh, i did about the same Self insert as chef snd first partner my mascot oc as thief
All hail fleshhorse
As someone who played 3ds ver, it is just as good
3ds Version IS Basicly The Same Just Without The Absolute Great Mii Maker In The Switch Port
Finally... Scott Falco: The Game on Switch.
This might only be me but I am kinda mad because now I am forced to buy mini topia for switch to experience the “new” content >:( but with some clips here and there I wouldn’t mind buying the same game with some differences
Crack on Crack the game
Yeeeee Miitopiaaaa
This video brings me so much joy. I loved this game ever since the 3DS demo and this basically sums up my everything I feel towards the game.
So far my team is made up of my mii (same one that I’ve been using for years), my sister, my bald present mii, and Shrek. I lack creativity.
I love how in Miitopia you could literally play as a h*ntai protagonist and no one would ban you
Yeeeeeees first I get to watch Peebs play it now Scott 😃😄

Oh my god we both made flesh horses.
Now CC is even more of a bopping bitch of a bot in the bottom right corner
I LOVE THIS SIG AND TESSA REMAKE
toes
how do you make such good miis?
Personally, I played this game on the 3DS a few years back, and it’s stayed in my mind ever since. Heck, I’d call it my favorite RPG of all time. I have yet to play it on switch yet, but I’ll get into it again eventually in another year or so when I eventually get a random craving to blast through the game again. It’s just nice seeing people get really into this game I love so much, regardless of if I’m playing it myself or not.
Miitopia, a game that only works if you're either a streamer/YouTuber or have OCs   Or both of course
Yo 5,567th
Still hope they put tomadachi life on switch
I played the OG and it was fun but now I want to play the port but I also don't want to spend money on a game twice
Good vid
This is prob one of my fav games of all time, its just oozing with joy and is easy to play new players. It’s also coddles to the hardcore players with the tower of dread and despair. Even if I’m not good at making miis it doesn’t matter it’s still just a blast and I recommend that you get it.
73rd!!!!1!!1!1!!!!1!!
Even on the 3DS this game is amazing. Sure, we don't have the godly horse, tower of Dispair, or the ultra-awesome character creation and a few stuff but I still love it.  Any game where you can go on an adventure with Sans, Wallace and Pico is a good one, and although I don't have many Miis on the switch, I'm getting that port one day.

Fanfiction the game
SCOTT IS ABOUT TO GET TO 1MIL FINALLY !!!
Yes! Finally a game where I can date the greatest waifu of all time!  SHREK!
F L E S H  H O R S E
I like your characters their cute.
I used to replay the demo of the 3ds version all the time and actually being able to play has been really fun
That was a fun watch  If you need miis for your playthrough I made some... well... some is an understatement I made a ton of miis xD The makeup feature is insane and I LOVE IT And I only have the demo lol  Here's my code 33BHP31 All made by mii.... yes, the lowest of the hanging fruits
This trap will keep me safe is perfect meme material
I love this game, I played it on the 3DS and it was one of the most enjoyable games I played on there. And with all of the new features, it’s great. I would definitely recommend.
It’s so entertaining seeing creative types like yourself play this and seeing what wonderful characters and scenarios can be brought about. I get a lot of enjoyment out of watching you stream stuff like this where you can really flex your creative muscles in a casual way with no pressure. Always nice to see you have fun Scott!
I just joined and the first thing I see is horse
Where's the salt, I see only sugar : D  And DK's coconut cream pie but that's beside the point
Awesome vid!!
Can we agree the inn is where the true gameplay happens
Flesh Horse will haunt my dreams
Yes, I love it
The main character for my save file is Peter griffin
my dog destroyed my 3ds miitopia copy when i was around with the elves
Lum is good civilization,good choice
The final boss of miitopia F L E S H H O R S E
Amazing work
YOU HAD TO END IT WITH THE SEPHIROTH FLESH HORSE THING. Lost my shit to that on stream. 10/10 again Scott
IT ENDED? NOOOOO
Seeing my Miis pop in some people's videos is nice.   XX9C8Y I didn't make every single mii in this 499 list but I did make 69 of them
Man I loved the original game but didn't want to buy the remake since it looked too simmilar but seeing this I'm honestly kinda tempted.
O god sig is gonna become a yandere and will kill cc
THIS GAME IS A GREAT TIME!!!
Miitopia is like when you blend every cursed model replacement mod and combined it with final fantasys battle system and job system as well as Persona 5s confidant system
Nice video
MIIIIIIIIIIIITTTOOOOPPPIIIAAA
this is going to be fun.
A comment from before the video is uploaded. Behold!
Egg
Miitopia? More like Piitopia, am I right gamers?      jk, i like this game quite a bit
