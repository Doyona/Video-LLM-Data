Every day in Harris Park
Obviously he screwd up trying to back down, ya wankas!  Kudos to getting out of it; I never would have been able to do it!
This video is an argument against the idea of universal suffrage, and also an argument for buying Honda.
Pretty impressive
Measured and staged for a you tube video
He did long division against the inverse instead of multiplication.
WTF. That's all I can say. 😅
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
This smacks of being a bet. Dude filming bet this driver he couldn't turn around on this driveway without destroying his car or getting hella stuck.  Dude in that Honda said: "Hold my beer!". 🤣
I have a feeling if this guy finds a crack in a sidewalk instead of just stepping over it like the other 100,000 people did that day he would spend a week building a bridge over that little crack
Imagine how this bloke brushes his teeth!
Wher did that guy get he’s license. Did he know ther is a gear called reverse in every car.
I really feel for the person in the red car, Spain is full of those tight tricky uphill driveways. Actually impressive they did turn it around in didn't fall down backwards.  So who took the video?!
Some serious Austin Powers vibes with this one.  But had he only backed all the way, he'd be long gone by now...
The only thing more shocking than that he didn't just... reverse right back down the hill, was that he accomplished this insane and wholly unnecessary task at all.
Never occurred to him to just reverse? lololol
Almost impressed if it wasn't for the stupidity of not just reversing.
Exactlty! Judy back down. But give him props for eventually escaping Destination F'd.
That was the best worst driver I've ever seen!! 😂😂😂 It takes some serious talent to be that bad at driving while being that good at the very same time!
This video gives me incredibly mixed emotions.
Typical asian driver , can't back more than a few metres. He managed to complete the U-turn and happily drove off to get his clutch replaced 👍
Conversely, if nobody was judgemental, then nobody would have a moral compass, at all.  Like with most things in life, the trickiest part is determining where you want to draw that line in the sand.
Impressive
In the upside down world  this makes perfect sense.
I reckon that driver and all of his countryfolk have migrated to the UK, since this stellar example of incompetence as we see atrocious and ridiculous driving like that on a minute by minute basis on our roads over here
Why? Whyyy? Why in name of heaven? WHYYY?? My brain hurts trying to understand any logics behind this 😶
Some much vehicle damage for the sake of pig headed ignorance…
Please link to the original video.
Disliked
Chinese cars come without reverse gear now?
I knows great detailer
i was actually rooting for him at one point there
Why take the easy way when you can make things complicated...
Least unsafe Toronto driver
He wants to die😮😮😮😮
The 100-point turn
How the hell did he pull this off?
There are people out there that cannot reverse. I've seen it. It's scary
The dictionary-definition of chinese driving.
Couldn't just back down? THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE! ON THE ROAD! NO WONDER BROKEN AI DRIVES BETTER THAN HUMANS. Holy. Hell. Kill me now.
Insane I would've flipped my shit and totaled my car trying that big props cuz anyone else would've just said fuxk it leave it there 😊😂😮
What I look like trying to parallel park
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should!
News channels have to take this person for an interview.
Exactly. Cars have a reverse option for a reason.
I can’t believe he actually pulled this bullshit off! 😂
I was hoping to see Destination Fukced. So were you.
Only fearless and expert driver in this world...
Austin Powers has left the chat
Unreal
Subtitle: Driving in the Philippines.
Backup camera was broken, so he had to turn around instead of just backing up.
Reverse was an option on this car 😂😂😂😂
Just one small mistake he made, he could have gone a little more forward by about two or three inches. He could have even pressed the front plastic bumper a bit to get more space. Nevertheless great job.  👍🙂🤟👊
This was the best free ad commercial for HONDA I've ever seen lol
The entire galaxy screams "WHY DIDN'T HE USE REVERSE?" No answer.
Why 😂
Was he supervised and coached by my wife?  💁🏽‍♂️
Obviously kinda dumb, buuut I do appreciate their determination.
Maybe he is a great driver and just won a bet.
2:41- Lmao Um, you do know 98.8% of all of your videos are judging people videos, right?!?
0:17- What kind of dumb a$$ would try to turn around on a street this small instead of just backing down?!? I’m pretty sure this car (like ALL OTHER CARS) also have the ability to go in reverse!!! If he makes it or not, I wonder how much damage he did?!?
w...why? xD
Dude’s from my hometown, proud of him
Respect for the camera-holder for not walking up to him and tell him to just reverse!
I am not sure if he is one of the best drivers I have seen (for making that turn work) or one of the worst onces (for not just reversing out of it XD)
The irony is that he has to do it again at the Y because the pass is blocked down there. Maybe he should have BACKED DOWN the ramp 40 feet.
That’s being stupid, but successful at the same time. “I cannot for any reason whatsoever back up in a reverse position, that’s too dangerous” 😅
This is what “I will never admit I’m wrong” looks like
That was the only way he could go the direction he wanted to on the road. If he’d of backed down he would be pointing the wrong direction.
Impressive brand advertisement. Got to get me one those, the one I have would have gotten stuck on the 1st recovery attempt. 🤪
This happens to me often…
When this dude says YOLO, he’s not fucking around
Asians are renowned for their fantastic driving skills.
Thats what some people does on purpose for Tiktok in China, for money obviously.  No rotational driver would do anything like that
This takes stupidity to a new level.
He's like Austin Powers in the golf cart
Huh, didn’t know you could do that, seems as long as one wheel is up the other will follow. Both rear wheels off the edge all bets are off, got it. Not gonna try but good to know…
I sure hope this person doesnt have a important job.
And why didn't just reverse all the way to the bottom?
6million point turn
Promotional video for all wheel drive option ???
Its the amount of dry steering that hurts me the most.
So many people have not figured out this is a staged stunt. Noticed how there is a camera strategically positioned to capture the event from start to finish? Noticed the precision driving needing double footwork of both accelerator and brake peddles and the nerves of steel?
holy front wheel drive
My mechanics says its not good.
Difficulty: Asian
How ye know its pronoun is "he"? Maybe it identifies as "she", and shes never reverse! ☝️
As someone who works in the car industry, I deal with these people every single day 🙃 🤦🏽‍♀️
Looks like every driveway in the Perth Hills
The whole video I'm clenching teeth and sucking in air.
only one explanation, is doing a challenge or bet or something..? he definitely knows how to drive a car , well enough how to reverse a car , and someone filming him, and a car down there like blocked the road like try to stop people driving by , other solution is keep the front wheels burn out ,slowly rotate the whole car, i saw one guy do that in a ally in a movie.
I’d be more impressed if he just backed down!!!!😂😂😂
this why most used cars are toast in just couple of years... they buy it to abuse it... thankfully no longer possible due to manufacturers now making worst cars without any extra reliability
I believe it was this fella who dropped a penny down a drain. He then flew to the other side of the world, hired some drilling/tunnelling equipment and spent 10 years boring his way through the Earth’s core till, finally recovering the coin. Quite a guy.
This is so stupid.
Impressively stupid! But still damn Impressive!
next day a lorry driver starts up that same road after taking a wrong turn, and doesn't want to reverse back down... 😊
Reverse bro.
This happens to me personally, in my nightmare of course.
I forgive him 😅😅😅😅
Just go on ahead and give this man an NY Driver's license..👏👏👏.
Plot twist, the road hes driving into is one way, and not the eay hes facing😂
And then he had to do the same $hit again once he left the ramp, because up there there are cars blocking the road and he had to go the other side down anyway. Weird world.
He Just could have gone reverse, much easier then what He actually did
It hurt to watch that.
Honda in China is saving money by not including reverse gears apparently.
I thought he didn't have reverse gear but he did!
Window rolled down camera man spotting and giving instructions. STAGED FOR VEIWS
What’s impressive is he is actually turning the car around
So he's smart enough to pull off the worlds most impressive u turn, but can't realize that he could just back straight out? My brain hurts
A real life npc
For those wondering why he didn't just backup, thats simple  its because of the grindset.
Literally every input by that driver is wrong
I can not believe that worked
You look at the mirror to look at the ground
This ended better than expeted.  I was expecting a smashed rear bumper and roof.
Much much better muted
Google maps strikes again
I’ve never seen such a stupid decision executed so well.
He’s probably now going to reverse down the other road
I know a few people that's like that and it drives me insane😂
Thats probably a rental
Perfect 27.5 point turn 😅😅😂
That poor Crosstour.
😂
The blind spot in those are horrible...I own one...if you dont have a backup camera you  might have a bad time. And I  not an unexpired driver.
this must have been a bet, no way anyone would do that otherwise.
I thought I invented the joke of the twenty seven point turn.
This seems more of an advertisement of what the car can do in a very horrendous situation 🤣
For sale- 1 lightly used well loved car. 50k Firm.  This dude when he realizes he fucked his frame and suspension.
Good to know i can do this... but why in the first place?
So make it complicated when you can get it easier. 🤷‍♂️
Quite the impressive work there
Why not just reverse and turn around once you're out of the ramp????
Good camera work! I probably would not have been so confident that he was going to succeed. Jesus is my savior!
Good that he remembered to check his mirrors just in case there is a flock of birds flying right behind him
Send this video to his insurance company❤😂😂😂❤ Nice job tho😊
Never underestimate an idiot.
Totally clear that this is a one way drive. He's just following the rules and driving down as it is supposed to be. Loyal man, very respectful
"nah mate, I said : Put air in ya back tyres, not put ya back tyres in the air!"
Also its just a front wheel drive. So once the weight was off the front wheels he was almost screwed. That guy should not be allowed to steer a vehicle because this was completely unnecessary and dangerous.
Wow!  I’m truly impressed how he got himself out of the most idiotic situation.  Lucky he had AWD
I'm shocked im surprised he didn't fall imagine him doing this everyday when going out from home 😂😂😂😂😂😂
or you can back up.
I for sure expected him to do it again at the bottom to turn right!!! - Must admit I'm a little disappointed
Outside of the damage to his undercarriage that was actually quite impressive.😂
clutch as good as new. belly a little bit scratched
That would be awesome if after done with the turn, he went and backed up the hill.
This guy is the greatest driver in the world!
He clearly does this every day, I believe it is his own drive way.
Rumour has it he performs this ritual on the daily.
I'm trying to figure out why he couldn't just back it out. Was he just doing this for views? This makes zero sense.
Cant fkin believe he actually pulled that off
Gotta say, well done point turn, i would also have just backed out but we chasing clicks homies like diddie lol, come on homie, give us a review on that
Tom Petty's "I won't back down" was playing on the radio.
It was probably a bet with friends that he would be able to turn around there. Pretty impressive.
Pretty sure this guy owned the last used car I bought
I can't decide if he's a very skilled driver making an odd choice, or a very bad driver with a lot of luck.
Why not reverse the route he took?
Wonder how much damage was done underneath?
I was in Japan, and yes, they do have roads that are damn near vertical. That was impressive, I thought he was stuck for sure.
I'm guessing it must be illegal to reverse onto a road in China, either that or the guy don't know his arse from his nose...
My guess is, he attempted to back down and fucked up. That's when he did the impressive 50-point turnaround.
Good effort 😂😂😂
I suspect this is a demonstration. The driver is clearly competent lol
He is just living his life with the Idiot Savant perk lol
It's not judgement. It's a credible observation.
I was sure he would've been stuck in the mid-way point when both rear wheels were off the road. I'm not sure if I should be impressed or disappointed.
Easy in 5 Seconds… reverse! 😂
Why🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
Couldn't just back down the way he came up. 😑🖕
If the car was not 4x4, it would have been destination f****d.
This is the way.
下の道路までバックで降りると言う1番簡単な方法を選ばずに車にダメージを与える方法でターンをすると言う通常では考えられない方法を選択した男😅 僕には理解できない。 これで、『運転が上手いでしょう』と自慢したらウケる🤣
Yeah right
Backing down would have been boring.
なにやってんだか😂
A classic example of how because your parents have money, it doesn't mean you have intelligence.
倒車下去有很難?
Hondas don't have reverse.....
Japanese　HONDA　automobile　car→nice car maker
We call them, lowlanders, Appalachian Hillbilly here, this is hilarious!!!😅
Was really hoping he’d fall
If it's stupid but it works it ain't stupid.
The wall is not as high as it seems to be.
that was so much easier than just backing down the hill.
Now we all 100% know he couldn’t do that in a manual transmission 😂
香港不少群組曾經有人對一些路段指不能做到調頭動作，若能做到便稱「車神」，該影片的情況能做到，這已經可以叫「車神」了。｛我沒有任何奉承意思！真的！｝
上手いな
The driver was more afraid of hitting the front end then falling Down .
これアウトじゃんシャーシ擦ってるよな。そのままバックした方が早くないですか？
Muy sencillo, es un Honda...!!
It's not about how to "drive good", it's all about "how to be an idiot"!
Weltklasse Fahrer
単純にバックすりゃ良いんじゃね 車の下廻りは摺りまくって傷むし まぁ　この切り返しを成功させる事自体が目的なんだね
👍👍👍👍👍👍
It’s crazy and stupid , but I watched it 😂
Like austin powers in the bunker🤣😂
Respekt 👍
Best 1000 point turn I’ve seen in my life. Hands down.
The rice was too heavy in the boot he didnt want to risk losing the rice
This is the most skilled driver Iv ever seen. I would have put the hand brake on and got out. The risk of  the car falling off the side was too high.
If living life on the edge was a person 😂😂
A++++++
It's always them crazy aisians
I hate to be that guy, but surely this is staged.  Why would there be someone stood there recording this and why would anyone even attempt this manoeuvre in the circumstance?  There is literally zero reason for this event to exist other than for people to see it.
What is he doing he should not be aloud in a car
Always check your mirrors😂😂😂
Ya know, for how dumb this looked, I'm honestly seriously impressed he actually tuned the car around up there.
Guess he didnt have a reverse camera ..
Next up on, just rolled in.
Was this done for a stunt? Or was it a stunt doing it?
“I don’t have all the specifics” seems like quite the understatement
I won't be surprised if the person recording the video who most likely got the car into this mess is his wife. And he had to take it over and undo the fuckup.
Just reverse out ?
How to drive good? This is so stupid.
To be fair… I’m amazed he managed to turn around but I have to question why the hell he didn’t just reverse down the hill?
Comunque ha graffiato tutto il telaio sotto l'auto 😅
This guy does a lot of this style of video to show off his driving skills.  It wasn't because he took a wrong turn, it was just to show that it can be done, don't try this at home 😅
That's stupid and incredible at the same time
That's just bonkers. Stupid for getting into the situation, but masterful getting out.
Вы не могли задним ходом съехать? Слов нет..
Good luck when buying that used car. 😂
This kid just proved this is all a video game. There's no way he should've been able to make that turn...
wait I thought that women couldn't drive to save their lives but here is this joker.
Does he not know how to drive in reverse? 😭🤦🏻‍♀️ How is this person still alive with the way he thinks? 😂
Asian powers unlocked !
Examinator told him to go up this road and then turn around😂.
damn i was so hoping he would go over the edge
Other question...why did someone chose to video record this instead of telling them to back out?
Ngl...I was cheering for this dude. I wanted to see him succeed. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
His 3000 point turn was on point, give that man some love please. A Sheila would have reversed it of the whole cliff. Destination fked doesn't even come into this mans vocabulary
Wtf is he turning??
I am impressed
It's funny how everyone is like I got to stop and record that sh*t
Wow... How foolish...
Stupid, but impressive nonetheless
It was common sense and to logical to just reverse and call it a day. Definitely a democrat.
Ever since he failed to become a doctor like his parents asked of him. It’s been all downhill
He didn’t reverse because I presume he did it for YouTube video content
Don't stress, it's just s a Honda.
What sorcery is this!?!!
He needs to repeat the same maneuver at the bottom to continue downhill 😅
"I can turn around" "Dude you're hangimg off the edge! Just back down!" "I said I can turn around!!"
Pain
Ah yes. Something else I have never done and I’m sure will never be called for.
He obviously works by the minute for the us government!
WOW! Ok never mind why not just reversing, now I’m thinking this guy lives there and he’s just too used to his driveway and doesn’t wanna give it an inch he wants to do it his own way. Did he just defy logic?
Asian drivers are the best 🙂
Of course he could have backed down but he wanted to see how many point turns it would take to do what he did,,, that took skills and he proved it could be done ,,, amazing really. Wonder if he could do it again🤔
How did he wake up get dressed and drive a car
Is it what we call a stupid genius?
For Sale gently used Honda Accord...😂
Didn't think that was possible 😂
Yeah thats awesome! Must be jabbed to the max as most would just back the fuck up!
That is simultaneously the most stupid and also the most legendary piece of driving I have ever seen
There are some people in this world that should not get behind the wheel of a car and we just watched one of them.
That was impressive that he pulled that off despite how incomprehensibly dumb that decision was.
This is why insane asylums exist.
Here's your sign.
As a delivery driver that made me physically nauseous, realizing he could’ve just backed down the driveway at the end.
The point of that?
When sh!t goes south, it happens quickly. This guy was extremely close to finding out how fragile life really is....
Despite the poor grammar of your title i watched anyways.   It should be " how to drive well. " If course he did not drive well.  As you said how did he get in that position and why not back down?
So much for the stereotype.
Proof Asians CAN drive lol
Yeah the last thing I would have thought was to back straight out.
Does this guy work for the US government?
All I want to know is where did he lose his brain
The ole catch 22, should I be impressed and marvel at the capabilities of humanity to do impossible things, or be ashamed at how dumb we are....
At least he got to apply the 46 point turn into practice,making the poor Honda a Hon-duhh im a dickhead
Intelligent species. Yeah right 🙄
Why didn't he use his mirrors and reverse back down ? Uhh..!
How did this fellow end up in that position in the first place..??
I dont think hes the one who got the car in this position. Hes the "fixer".
As an Australian I'd be getting the kids to verify the make & model of the driver. Then waiting for the kids, to go yeah, your right again Dad.
I think the front wheel drive did help to control and tractions, but yeah good driving highly skilled👏👏👏👏
I need to find that driver. I feel like I owe him money for all the doubt I had in him.
Honda, shocking 😂
Kudos to Honda for starting the machine army
What if this is his OWN DRIVEWAY!
I can't watch.
One hell of a u-turn.  Never been done before I think.  I give him 100 for stupidity for not taking the easier option of reversing down on the driveway,  but I also give 100 for remaining cool and focused while making the u-turn.
Epic bit of unneeded driving! Just put her in Reverse mate.
You see this kinda crap all the time in Richmond BC
I have SOOOO many questions 😂 who’s filming for one and who are the 2 cars in the background? just passerby’s who were like “what’s this dickhead gotten himself into?” 🤦🏻‍♀️
That guy's life must be intense. "Forgot to buy oranges at the supermarket, guess I gotta go to Florida"
"He needed to turn around..." Unbefuckinlievable
1 can NEVER Do this in An EV
I will forever have nightmares about this
I'm impressed with pulling it off! But he could have been gone by now
Women drivers please take note.
He probably pees doing a hand stand.
Its terrifying driving on the same road as these people 😮
This confirms what I always thought about airport valet parking services.
The number of people on here who don't get that he did the turn as a challenge, rather than because he wasn't well aware that reversing would have been easier. 😂  Judging by how well he executed the turn, he could probably have reversed blindfolded and steering with one foot.
Me trying to back out of any conversation
To be honest, this is insanely impressive.
What's the use of making this U-turn ???
I would have NEVER thought he could pull that off. Thought he was going off the back side for sure.
It’s not too often you see someone with more skill than brains.
Very stubborn about not backing up, a masculine tendency.
Could have just reversed..... instead decided to make a precarious 50 point turn and simultaneously ruin the underside of his car.
People who hand out license should be held accountable.
This is a win
Who da faq is recording?
Did know that be possible, cool. Thanks
Man insists on playing on the hardest difficulty in every single task in his life, the only explanation.
I mean, to be fair, Ozzy does do some pretty damn good translations 🤷‍♂️
Mirrors, mirrors and mirrors; teach the driving school students about the use of the mirrors and how to reverse with them before releasing dilettanteism into the traffic. Or earn the shame you deserve as a worthless instructor for grading them as passed which they obviously didn't.
He’s gonna need new tires, brakes and other odds and ends.
That poor Honder...
I need the yeanahnahnahyeanah at the start as my new ringtone
I bet the sills look like corrugated card now 🤣
This is what happens when you get pissed up and have to back up your bullshit stories to your mates.
This guy did not deserve for that to work.
how the hell did this even work out at all
Honda should be proud of their engineers and give this guy a job as a test driver. Impressive.
That car would have a reverse camera, why tf didn’t he just reverse
😮
Can’t believe people are stupid to think that someone who could pull this trick off couldn’t reverse the car like they do 😂
I stand corrected.
Honda: says it all.
🤡
Honda baby.
I'm honestly impressed
Thank the Heavens for front wheel drive.
I hope i never get a valet like this !! 🙈
Never ever buy a car without the reverse feature! That was strangely impressive though.
Austin Powers approves
He just wanted to show me skills
I like your judgy-judge, comment. 😂 I leave judgements to cats, because they are freaking amazing, at it. Was the car a Hyundai? Maybe the engine had been recalled, like so many, but Hyundai wouldn’t replace it, without meticulous, maintenance records. The sludgy oil syndrome. The struggle is real.
Wow
I would like to know who was filming this dude lololol 😂
WTF?  Unbelievable!
Omg.. Just reverse buddy
Deluxo dream
It was a bet...a challenge...guys will do some pretty dumb stuff when on a bet....
Skill - 100 Common sense - 0
Well that was pointless, just passed their test doesn't understand the dynamics of reversing
I love the voice over for this @Ozzy whatever the other bit is. It's brilliant as always 😅😊
That is a perfect example of someone that has no business driving ... like how did he figure it was a good idea to go up that little hill ??But especially why would he decide to turn around instead of just backing up the same way he got there?? Definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed imo !!😂😂😂
WTH is he trying to do?!  Turning around somehow made more sense than just reversing down the road?!  I don't evenn know how someone like this even survived to be old enough to drive.
Вопрос. Почему он просто не сдал на зад?! На хрена эти моневрв?
А просто вернутся задним ходом не получилось? Зачем усложнять простые решения.
ZERO tread on the tires
Может надо было задом сдать!? Зачем портить автомобиль!?😮
Ну и нахера это нужно было
OMG what a driver WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
A GOOD DRIVER  would have just backed down from there !!  WHY did he go UP there to begin with ?
He must have no reverse .. talk about dodgy
inexplicable !
Knowing your vehicle at its best right there.
just reverse!!!!!!!
Best Honda ad I’ve ever seen.
Maybe he had a bad neck and couldn't turn around to reverse down the road. His power steering and brakes are getting a helluva workout as well as the undercarriage. Whatever, that could have ended very badly
He probably didn't just reverse cause it was too easy for him. Like playing a game you're already bored of and just doing some trick shots when normal shots get you the same points.
Joder con sacarlo marcha atrás no destrozaría el auto haciendo una maniobra que no todo coche puede hacer valla bobería que estupidez
Austin Powers
Lol-alotta, I thought this guy was going to kiss his cars ass with the sunken road, but no, he's a pro.
Impressive. Did not think he would make it.
Definitely embracing the stereotype.
What I find disturbing:  The only real thing accomplished by this act was tragically re-affirming to the guy that what he did was sound decision making.
Can't just use reverse then..
must be a rental
Not for one moment did it look like the driver was losing his composure, cool as a cucumber. What a legend - and no, I'm not talking about the model of Honda he was driving.
Soooo ..was he a good driver, or a bad one? 😂😂
why not just back down......
He’s just lucky as fuck that is a front wheel drive car…
It's one of them YouTube 'life-hack' videos to show you how to do things easier 😂😂
Полный неадекват хайпует
That is a Chinese license plate. Anything can happen in China
OzzyMan would be an inspirational racing coach.
So of the repair shop just for doing a stupid video...
Austin Powers still has him beat.
I remember back in the day getting myself into this jam.
I was waiting for you to say he could of just backed up! Haha
to be fair ...how this man pulled of a 15 point turn on that slope without absolute disater was hughelly impressive though😂😂😂😂😂
I'd love to see that guys car up on a lift mate.
They is not a singular pronoun. Deprogram yourself of Marxism.
FWD car
Why didn't he just reverse off the edge, sometimes at makes you think how did he pass his car test doing stupid things like that.
That was actually a pretty impressive 20 point turn
Hopefully it's a rental...
This can't possibly be a man..
They just handing out licenses in cereal boxes there? 😬
He has a car that only goes forward 😂😂😂😂
“What do mean ‘just back down the ramp’?That’s way too scary”
entertainment folks, driver is a professional. they knew vid would get impressions.
My God this is nerve wracking just to watch 😵‍💫😨🥺😬😓
For sale...never seen snow
Naaah, I've got this. I do it every morning. My driveway's a bitch.
Un massacre ! 😳 Cette vidéo doit être sponsorisée par des garagistes,,, 🤔
the car's underbody has been shielded, hydraulic suspension added and nascar type tires, too...tires are very wide w/ no tread pattern.
Perfect example of practice makes a man perfect but not intelligent....😅
Well done mate for doing the impossible
Damn... I thought for SURE he was GING OVER!!!
And is the type of person from where I’m from were we’d all agree they’d bought their drivers license. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Oh good grief, that is the worst way of extracting a car I've ever seen - and yet eventually successful? I thought for sure he was going to back that thing right into Destination Fucked.
The Asian part makes sense.
The irony is that this guy probably thinks he's an excellent driver because he made the turn in that narrow spot.
Don’t you mean “don’t judge others” unless they have conservative view points?
I cannot believe he made it  That should NOT have worked
This gave me incredible anxiety. Reverse , next time, nit wit.
Im not even mad, thats amazing.
And here ladies and gentlemen is a skill you will never need.
The guy was so timid he made the decision to do this.
Not to stereotype but this is how they drive in Pasadena, CA also 😂
The stuff of nightmares
😅 I think it was an intentional thing. A challenge of some sorts
Runaway truck ramp?
No worries thatl buff right out
looked chinese, what do u expect
I have seen similar crazy videos from a channel in China, something about good driving skill channel.
When you have a phobia of reverse driving
Well I’ll be damned , that was pretty dang impressive 🤷‍♂️🤟🤟
There's no way I could accomplish a 200+ point turn. With our without traffic. Was the fella that's filming this doing it for the Guinness world Record? Or for the insurance company after the seemingly inevitable fuck up? Guinness wins again!
The fact that he didn't just reverse back down is the highest level of special
A classic case of DWA  Driving While Asian
When ya have the skill to 3 point turn on a cliffside but reverse is just too hard basket 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️
I have so many questions
He purchased a car with no reverse gear... obviously.... Right?
Wow! Couldn’t just back off?
Had to be a bet. Too implausibly stupid otherwise.
Looking closer i see its a guy not a chinese or indian woman  behind the wheel.
The fact he was able to turn it around is just incredible 🎉 and stupid 😅 all mixed up
How to drive well
Do I look like an adventure vehicle tire?
I get that he’s doing this on purpose to prove that it can be done but we all know that one person who’ll do anything but drive in reverse.
Another demonstration of an unnecessary skill #43...25 point turns.
He simply wanted to fulfill his death wish 🤞🏽
Gotta give some props to that Honda all wheel drive system
Wozu?🤯
I wonder if that’s a rental?!
He's a genius 😕
Best Honda advertisement ever!!
So the lesson here is: If it's stupid, but it works, maybe it isn't stupid?
Dude your commentary makes this feel like a sporting event haha
How to drive WELL.
HOLY SMOKES!!!!!
Is that man Asian? And a poor driver?    How dare he perpetuate a stereotype.
I'm amazed he did it! Anyone else's anxiety spike a little while watching this?
I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hoping the car would just fall off. Damn it.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnd........  Plot twist!
That's it, I'm getting a Honda!
If you were a good driver you wouldn't be in this position in the first place😜
When excellent parking skills and zero logic come together
I would never do this to my car
Note, there was a camera person conveniently there....and from the angle..standing in mid air. Clearly this was professionally filmed and executed by a professional stunt driver. Not a bad job!!
Great job by the stunt driver. Great job by the cameraman too.
Good on him for being able to turn a fail into a win. If in the same situation, I would not have faired so well.
Wow.... wow...  wow... wow...w-o-w.
А не проще задом съехать и внизу развернуться.
My guess? Someone BET him he couldn't do what he just did?
well said a chinese saying: No zuo no die😂
I don't think I have ever before been impressed by someone doing something so stupid.
Obviously the reverse doesn't work, too easy 😂
Lepiej zniszczyć progi niż 50 metrów na wstecznym 😂
Idiota, justo go in reverse
Sometimes you have to back out.  Still he acted like he was parallel parking.  Just amazing he did this.  Is this car four wheel drive.
That’s got to be the dumbest 3 point turn (or 16 point turn) I’ve ever seen 😂
Ok, and what type of Honda is this?
You can’t fix stupid.
I don't know what I'm more mad at... The fact he didn't just back up or the fact i sat and watched him turn around ?? I guess it was my inner sloth that couldn't stop watching 😅
My guess is that the driver in the vid was not the one who put the car in that situation, but the one who was calles to fix it. One of those "better call my neighbour for this one" sort of scenarios, maybe?
😂😂🤣🤣....😮..weird??..just reverse back down the bloody road that you just drove up!!..🤪.......what a friggin hash up!!!🤣🤣😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its Austin Powers!
Asian
Perfect,he must perform on the high wire at the circus 🎪 😂😂😂
Commonsense left the drivers head
Just back out! Lol
That's Austin Power's son.
What the actual F***.
and somehow Mr. Bean doesn't look so far-fetched and comedic after all.
This must have been some kind of bet, I don't see any other reason why anyone would do such a idiotic thing
Bothers me that he could have just reversed
I mean he‘s stupid but at the same time he‘s a bloody sick driver
this is nothing but mind-blowing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How to drive more goodlier.
That's not kind of impressive, it is Fucking impressive
Ok, this just annoyed me to watch. It is really exhusting to watch people making life hard for themselves.
pretty sure I saw Austin Powers do this first. But well done!
I’m amazed that anyone could do that.
You just had to watch till the end LOL I bet the audience retention on the analytics was 100 %
Making shite of the underside..🤔
It’s against Muslim religion to drive in reverse.
Reminds me of that Austin Powers movie with the fork lift. LOL. His car don't have reverse or nutrile.
Austin powers stunt double
He is not the one who drove up that road. It was his wife. He is just getting them out.
Zu blöde um Rückwärts zu fahren.
what iff it went wrong, just to show off
why just why?
Dummheit muss grenzenlos sein.
Clearly they never told him how to reverse
It's baffling that he didn't think to just back down the hill. On the other hand, that was quite impressive that he pulled that off!!
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  Waste of time plus the damage to wheels and chassis, there's nothing to brag about by completing that U-turn.
Quelle idée stupide
Why? because he can do it
Thats pretty impressive actually....stupid as all hell....but impressive nonetheless
Its a honda 💪🦾
I can't decide if this proves or disproves the stereotype about Asian drivers.
This guys brain was used to train the autopilot AI.
R/iamverysmart
I was rooting for gravity 😢
Boss
Would be funnier if it was not staged.  Cars are blocking the road and the drivers aren't standing outside gawking.
His father in law said he would never pull it off, congrats son!
How can someone with good skills like that not be able to just reverse down
My only thought is he fucked up backing down, had a wheel go off the edge, couldn't get back up, and thought the only way to keep from falling was to turn around. All being said a tow truck could of pulled him back up for 1/20th the cost of the frame damage just did. Still lived life on his terms though.
What type of Honda is that?
That was actually quite impressive!
He gets the luckiest dumb person award. at around 1:30 he was basically balancing at almost falling off.
the traction of the car is impressive.
Another child with 11 thumbs and the propencity to stick the ice cream cone in its face…
😂
This is the rare example of Someone being so stupid in their situation, but executing it so skillfully.
Of course he could have reversed, but that is not what this is about. This is an amazing demonstration of skill, knowledge, and bravery.
Ok. I’m not a licensed driver but even I wouldn’t get to this point
Lack of common sense but made up for it with skills of patience
Bad review for the driver, great review for the car lol
These are the type guys wrecking semi-trucks on I-5
Good thing he had front-wheel drive (or 4-wheel).
Not sure why he didn't reverse straight out.
Some people are deathly afraid of reversing. I see it in parking lots all the time. They'll back out 3 inches and just cut the wheel and drive over 5 empty spaces.
Why would aliens give a shyt about humans? 😋
WTF? Why did that even make sense to do?
That is the luckiest man in the world. I can't believe someone stood and filmed this and let him do what he did!
Alright, that's it! No more GTA5 for this guy! 😂
very bored man looking for challenge in life. S class imo, for skills or stupidity i cant be sure
Just back down the way you drove up???
Its pathetic and impressive at the same time.
Just because you can afford to drive, doesn't mean you should. He's lucky he didn't hurt himself.
No risk no fun 😁
Lol he even said it "reverse all the way would've been probably easier" 😂
😂😂😂 era só voltar de ré 😂😂😂
I am impressed.
Yes, he should have just reversed instead of doing a  23- point turn around!
Was this a dare like " i bet you cant do a U turn on this ramp" and the guys like " OH YEAH"
Wtf why didmt he just reverse down the ramp instead of trying to do a U turn?
The fact that this driver performed such a manoeuvre, whilst someone filmed the whole sequence is just mad....really expected this to end badly....😮
I do this in gta but with a burn out lol
Front wheel drive for the win!
That was pretty impressive... Stupid and unnecessary, but impressive.
People before reverse gear was invented :)
You couldn't back out? This doesn't make sense to me.
"Old or Asian?" -Bill Burr
Holy God. What a laugh 😂🤣 😅
Had to be a guy who made a bet he could turn his car around here.  This is just insane lol
When persistence meets stupidity
There's a reason they put side mirrors on vehicles. BACK UP
I thought for sure he was going over!  I mean we are watching Ozzy man, aren't we?
*I'LL BET A DEMOCRAT FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!*
he proved everyone wrong he has maximum skill iv never met anyone who could have done this
Camera man should of sat on the front end when his front tires were struggling with grip
front wheel drive car.
I want to believe that guys transmission is so bad he can't change it to reverse
think out of the box, it will work out in another way 😂
Would’ve been better without constant chattering
Looks like the right rear wheel just gave up entirely, totally fucked.  No movement from it at all once you get a view of it.
People saying he cant drive in reverse but he can clutch xontrol and mauever like that this was obviously a challenge
This explains why exhaust systems in 3rd world countries sound like crap.
Just a sharp right hand turn at the bottom and he'll be on his way
0 brain power 150%driving skill that was simply amazing lol
One of the things from 1000 stupid ways to die.
Weeeew
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🎉
I didn't not expect "success" lol
Driver: Pay up, I told you I can do it.
The dude : "I an NOT a stubborn man." Good job 👍
This is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. What they don't tell you about are the thousands of dollars in damage done to the undercarriage of the vehicle, the exhaust, brake lines, muffler, etc.
This is a prime example of how lunacy and genious have a certain amount of overlap...
🫤
This is what you can do with a Honda.
Austin Powers enters the chat
Gotta give it to the guy, for taking stupid to new levels!!!👍😂
With patience and a little common sense just back up
Severe fear of backing up 😂. Good job 2000 point turn
Sisu
Complete NUTTER
One O ✔️
Why do you refere to sexual intercourse while describing this driver?  Get rid of that foul language!
When a person is scared to parallel park but does thus instead.
My brain hurts
Go reverse, What is the smartness in that wasting time and fuel ...
No point acting like a smart arse when you couldn’t even follow the correct route. 😅
He turned simplicity into complexity for no reason
How to make views with rental cars
REVERSE
No way! He actually made it! Not sure if steel balls, or thick brain though...
this person will be mindblown to find out that cars can drive reverse too
Is no one gonna mention about the 3 cars in the background that are stuck because the silver car won't back up to a wider spot to let the other 2 cars past? There stuck for at least 4 minutes!!
Well, since we didn't see him get into this situation I'm assuming he is a professional driver showing what could be done. Looked like he had to have spotters somewhere, no one is that perfect on their own.
This is one daft kundt.  Just reverse mate.
This Asian people do like to show of their parking skills. It is not the first time to see this kind of videos.
Fair dinkum! 😐
Enough of the talking
I've had lots of shitty cars with no reverse. Some people have never been poor so they don't get it.
He might be able to solve quantum theories but driving is a whole other beast. But well done
Can we assume they can't seeeeeeeee😂! I had to say it dam it
I should not have watched this before bed. I'm so anxious & stressed out. Idk if I can fall asleep.
WHY????
🌍🌄🌎  I'm white and I've been in this situation many times and I've always had to get someone to unfuck me  . I'd rather lose face than lose my wheels or worse
Kudos to the cameraman just filming that without saying anything
It's why some cultures have never progressed... They're too stupid or lazy!
Where's the guy that makes fun of those absurd "life hack videos"...?
My bottom jaw is down around my feet from watch this.  Omg
Best Honda Ad i've ever seen
um ..reverse gear?
Austin Powers would be impressed 😂
He’s obviously done this deliberately, it takes quite a bit of skill to do what he did. If he wasn’t skilled enough he would have fallen off the side of the road. Instead of making judgemental and in some cases blatantly racist comments, think people!
Sills will be completely fucked, car will likely be a write off despite the fact it’s still perfectly drivable
Not gonna lie that was pretty good but reversing wouldve been 1000x better to your car and easier
This is like something that would happen in a nightmare
No wonder everything worked out Great,Thank you Honda♥️💯
Miss Ozzy reviews 😭, Never laughed so hard since his older vids lmao
He probably did try to reverse and then went over the lip and had to salvage it this way
Even with the sheer amount of added stress on the chassis and suspension, it still managed to do it seemingly no problem. Kudos, Honda.
So the car does have reverse, can it not reverse 25 feet at a time?
Mr bean driving
Stupid, but impressive...😂
This seems like the sort of person who has done this before.
for 3 full minutes I thought that guy was fucked! incredible.
Lol, reverse is outdated... This looks exactly like when companies are trying to be 'different', then they provide the exact same service with some additional bullshit, that we as customers have to put up with, as there are no longer normal services, they're outdated too... 😂🎉
Why easy when you can do it complicated?
Just reverse straight down, what a show off!
can't believe he did that in just under 4 minutes 😮
I dont know if he is the worst or the best driver ever 😂😂
why not just reverse?
Drivers name is Leslie pace from mck ca
He's the epitome of a forward-looking person, going back isn't an option for him
Why are you guys blaming this hero? How much you want to bet it was his wifey that got the vehicle into this precarious situation she’s standing safety to the side out of harms way! Telling him what to do!
Just show off 😅 and lots of waste of time ,,,could have saved most of the if reversed downwards simply.
it was a stupid move but damn, that was some impressive skill
an AWD Crosstour would have done that easier I'd guess.   Not that it would have been a good idea.  That guy is insane.
but why?
He did it, because he can !
Faaack!!!
That is thinking outside  the box taken to the next level😂
I missed the part where the driving was good.
It’s like inadvertently finding another way to solve the maths problem.
actually, it's really impressive
Did he lose a bet or something? But to be fair that was impressive. Stupid but impressive lol
What the .....
I never had problems placing the 18 meters articulated buses in reverse in the repair bays, I can drive with only 2 cm in every side and yet it took me 8 trys to get the drive licence, one of them was acumulate 12 light faults for not going at maximum speed inside a town (50 km/h) with a truck, another was leaving the starting point too close to other vehicle but he got me driving one and a half hours till he told me that, another was for open the door of the bus 5 cm away of some marks, the time I got approved I had the door the same 5 cm away.... the drive licence is totally corrupted
Has alot of children also, can't pull-out of a driveway 😁
Very impressive however, I just don't get it
I smell burnt tyres! Weird.
how it feels like getting behind the wheel at your driving test
Yes he fucked up and should go by bus or taxi when he is unable to back up in reverse.....
that was quite an impressive feat. however totally unnecessary
Glad the camera man was there to capture the whole thing. Definitely not on purpose
Skill 99% IQ 1%
When showing off fails. Car is damaged but not his self esteem. 😂😂😂
Point is to show how to take U turn in such situations....ofocurse he know how to go in reverse.
Hairless apes and machinery just don't mix😂
He shows his driving skills but do you think no damage to the car ? Even tyres got weared out .
Dont worry he paid for the under coating
This takes the Asian myth to another level 🤦 wtf
That's mad skills!
Agent drivers.
I thought it was a chick cuz you know bloody female logic goin on here
I bet he gets to the bottom and has to do a 3 point turn to drive to the right!
I'm surprised you haven't come across these videos to realize that this fool did this for internet likes and reactions. He would have used his common sense to know to reverse all the way out and not risk his life and the welfare of his Honda Cross Tour. One day, just one day luck will run out on him and he'll crash to the doom awaiting him.
This is a perfect demonstration of N point turn.
I’m guessing reverse doesn’t work? Wtf?
I wonder how far into this maneuver he realized it would’ve been easier to reverse…
When brought up around his buddies, he blamed his wife.
Wait wait wait wait wait 🤔🤔 is that an Asian dude?
Typical Asian driver
That was beyond amazing, no cap!
Only one thing at the end of that road, and the some reason he’d did what he did to turn around: destination fucked
Great video, but way too much babbling on. Geez, take a breathe.   That is one calm driver, who did an incredible turn, without even damaging the vehicle.
Amazing and stupid. 10/10.
Brilliant
I hope he does not f*ck the way he drives.
Although the driver showed some kind of weird "skill" if it can be called as such - what's more obvious is their stupidity for not simply reversing all the way back down
honda civic for the fucking win
Reversophobic fella here 😂
The most amazing U-turn in the history of amazing U-turns.
What a 🛎️🔚
Get this man into a trails competition, he's a natural.
That poor underside of the vehicle.
German licence bestanden👍
Man that was some good dope!
As a professional driver I'll  just back down the hill. This was unnecessary
this is a true artist performing out his passion in the purest form. A lust to the eye
This is not good driving. A good driver would have reversed down the hole ramp. Not turning like that, and be more afraid of scratching the frontbumper then the underside of the car. It must have been quite damaged under after that ridicoulous turning.
That was physically painful to watch
Could have reversed but why not show off your 73 point turn like a boss
We're all dumb for thinking he's dumb lmao
That guy looked exactly like someone who would get themselves into a predicament like that.
I was waiting for it to fall off the hill.. bit disappointed 😑
Is it a rental?
Bet he went to college! 😂😂
中国贵州车牌
Just goes to show common sense is getting rare🤣
wow the driver is so amazing he is my idol now😏
This guy is good with what he's doing but I shall never hire him because he lacks common sense
Just roll straight back, no need for a 2000 point turn or even engaging reverse!! 😲🤔😳😁
What a waste of time !! It would have been quicker to just torch the car and report it stolen by an idiot who can't work out what the R stands for !
Impressive
Just a man proving stereotypes 🤣
Where in Asia did this happen? There are a lot of different countries in Asia that are tropical and mountainous...
If you’re stuck in a bind front wheel drive is a thing to get behind.
I would have just backed up and save 30 minutes lol
Looks like a drunk challenge lmao "yo bet you can't turn around on that ramp for 100$" "bet."
I guess this is the poster boy for doing things the absolute hardest way. Reverse is obviously too complicated for some. It's almost impressive that he was able to turn around there
I wanna make fun of him....... but, man, am I impressed as hell that he made that turn! 🤯
This person must be the worst reverse driver in the world to prefer the risk of falling off over going in reverse.
Impressive skills…though reversing would have been the simplest solution.
I think his car has NO REVERSE😮
how on earth did he manage to do that? Either he is a total noob of a driver or the most skilled one ive ever seen
Omg... 😅😂😅🤦
Is This is showing off for views? Reverse would of just done fine.
Sad but unfortunately very true story... I've actually been in this situation before, didn't see there was a ramp/drop off in a carpark and beached myself
Bakalaka Daka street
Wh..........😮🤔🫣
I really don't understand why not revers back down, just blank in my head of a reason why he could not do that if he can do a 200 point turn on a dime hmm....
No-way....
Low miles. One owner. No low ballers.
Almost equivalent to watching someone trying to parallel park that keeps trying to get their car into the parking spot.
I'm guessing he tried to back down and put the left rear tire over the edge, then found success with what we saw.
Wow. Im completely shocked and dumbfounded. He actually got out by doing a 3 point turn and his car didn't go over the ledge.
At the bottom of the hill he turned right
The fact that this driver achieved the turn with the vehicle still intact is astounding
Not faux but set up, Is that the same thing?
How'd he get outta this? Because he's in a Honda❤
Im impressed with that awd system.  Too bad tge pinch welds and bottom of car are all scraped up and crushed now. I feel sorry fir who ever buys it. Its amazing how people who can back up even get thrir license
Imagine buying this car listed as "only one owner, few thousand miles milage, superb condition!!"
I wonder who decided to stand there and film. “Yeah you’re good. Yep you got it. No you’re not about to fall off the side. Totally good”
Do we get to see the car’s undercarriage? Then we can see how well he did it
Now that is an impressive awareness of surroundings... and without seeing the back wheels, unlike the more recent video of people tripping over a bright yellow curb.
imagine doing this with your swift dzire😅
This had to be done on a dare or a bet. That was was pretty good control actually.
Is it weird to feel a little angry that he managed to turn around
Im still in shock here
I have no freaking idea why he just did that, but he can clearly drive in reverse. He's a pro, i mean, who makes a turn in such space
Driving stunt
🤔
Wow I was joking my breath
If you can do all that why didn’t you just look at your mirrors like you’ve been doing and just have navigated backwards the easier option but props on that Honda for being a monster with traction!
When shit driving meets holy shit driving
Typical honda driver, always seeking attention
Hey dude, you can just reverse down the slope. Dude: "NO"
Let’s all take a second to acknowledge the epic douche baggery of the cameraman. Making sure to catch it all, working the angles…it’s like Steven Spielberg was directing.
Stupidity is a hell of a drug.
Vendo auto, tenuta bene, ottimo affare.... 🤣 🤣
Ma non vi hanno montato la retro marcia???? 😂😂😂
Camoon.. wrong plan it this situation. :facepalm Just back down ir R.  Interesting - hol larbe bill he will get from mechanic..
What Honda is this?
By the time you made a u turn you are out of gas
It is possible the driver currently being filmed wasnt the driver that got the car into that aweful predicament. He might have been a kind helper and the person filming the true culprit.
Couldn't this DF go in reverse???
This man eats with his legs
Bro made a 1000 point turn. Also love that traffic stopped purely to watch him
He executed this but didnt feel he could reverse?
His life mantra is Backwards Never Forwards Ever...
He did it because there was a camera man, mystery solved
Around the 2 minute mark, I was wondering why he didn't get one of the kids to sit on the bonnet.
Yeah nah yeah old mate handled that like a BOSS!! Textbook 25 point turn!!
This is just to show you can turn around
IQ 21😂😂😂😂
This is a purposeful stunt. Look at the tread. He’s done this or similar stunts many times
Typical more money than sense action right here...😑
They is for more than one person. We have a single driver. Can we stop this gender neutral nonsense?
Hilarious commentary 🤣
I don't know how this dude survived this long! It's a miracle.
I Love my Asian friends, they are not lazy and unmotivated as some other friends of mine, but damn... I always say, this whole driving thing... It's genetic. It's gotta be!
And who made up that nasty rumor that Asians can't drive
Unfxckin real. WOW
we choose to do a 20 point turn today not because it is easy, we choose to do it because it's hard. And we don't like going backwards.
Honda really need to make this an add
The real question is why.  Why not back up
Just back down my guy.
I saw the licence plate and I understood everything.
When you will literally do anything besides drive in reverse.
Holy Spit ! That was some impressive maneuvering 😮 I’m with you Ozzyman let’s try not judging on how they got into the mess and couldn’t just reverse straight back and simply applaud in awe at their, let’s call it “success”
Luckily, the cameraman was there to let us know this was possible.
At the start of this video, especially considering the channel, I thought he was done for!
Was that a dare?
He took Austin Power's challenge
60k miles, well taken care of, All highway miles, regularly serviced, Drives like a dream, allways treated with most care, No lowballers, i know what i got!
This is from a channel that does all those impossible maneuvers
Best video i've seen this halloween
He makes it look difficult,  reversing out would have been so much easier.
Profasional driver right here
He did this because he wanted to show he could do it, he surely could've just reversed, but he didn't wanted to. Would you ask someone drifting why are they drifting if they can just make a normal turn?
😂 No matter how stupid that was, he got skills. 👏🍻=🔨♟️
=== REVERSE ===
Asian drivers
Was this an advert for Honda's? "No matter how dumb of a driver you are the Honda has your back!"
well, if you own a chinese car it does not matter at all what you do... it's scrap anyway from the day one... so you are welcome to make a 180 degree turn in case when you could just reverese... WAIT!!!! I got it - chinese cars do not have the reverse gear LMFAO
Best honda ad
Austin Powers would be so proud.🥲
I guess he made a bet he could turn with his car on this small street ;-P
Yes! 🎉🎉🎉😂🎉😂 oh em gee that was epic. This guy needs to be interviewed.
Didn’t go like I thought it would
Hard to believe it but he did it!
Plot twist: HE DID THIS FOR VIEWS. Incredible!
You cannot turn around the car on this street. Hold my beer!
Please tell me that's a rental car!
why that he just back it all the up down then turn around in the wider road instead? if he fell, he will be dead for sure being landing up side down in the car.
This has to be one of those videos made for those weird Chinese online video driving courses, where the guy pulls off impressive maneuvers to impress the audience. No way someone with such excellent driving skills would make such a stupid decision to not just reverse down the hill..
Gotta be a skit
As great as this is i cant help but think that he must be terrible at backing up.
YOU AND YOUR WOMEN DRIVERS...   I TOLD YOU I COULD DO IT...   YES MY LOVE, CAN YOU JUST TAKE ME HOME KNOW, TO CHANGE MY UNDERCRACKERS
There’s a popular phrase for this in the Dominican Republic. It’s: Muchoooooo Stupidooooo! 🤣🇩🇴
No regrats.
As somebody currently teaching someone to drive I can relate to this oh so much.
And you wonder how it was so easy for scumbag politicians to lock everybody down. Big tech and social media revealed the enormous amount of stupidity. Surprised he wasn’t wearing a mask!
This dude needs to learn how to REVERSE!!! For goodness sake guy, you could have been out of this situation in 30 seconds with zero damage. Just painful to watch.
For these things aliens do not visit us 🤣
That's actually a Honda Hover CX-5, he just fucked up his landing coordinates and missed the road. Very impressive skills overall; flying cars can be a bitch.
He was trying REALLY Hard not to damage the front bumper
This driver would not do well in a game of Tetris .
My wife, to avoid backing out of the driveway at all costs
this is what happens when a person usually rides a cow.. one day he was told to drive a car..🤦🏻‍♀️
This must have been a million dollar bet!
All I could think of was Austin Powers.
Wtf who told him he could park there?
The title alone should tell you lol
I genuinely did not see that as possible.
If he drives off of that forward, all sins are healed.
Why?
He could have just reversed indeed. In a messed up situation like this, I usually see a woman driving in confidence and doing epic idiocy. But this time it’s a dude.
Just put in in Reverse, simples
why the guy did not went back with rear ?
Only a honda could survive this
For people that don’t know: This man has many videos on YouTube proving possible 3 point turns in the most improbable/ impossible situations. He does it just because he can, not because he doesn’t know how to reverse
I've been drunk before but dam what level is this
ive seen this before, it seems counter intuitive. anyone else would have tried turning the opposite directions to straighten the car out and reverse down. but whatever he was doing worked. flipping amazing job. it didnt seem like it would work. but it did.  his patience was key. as ozzyman said. situations such as this cannot be rushed.
Now try it with hydraulics.
I think fuckup is a very respectful word
Especially the looking in his mirrors during this procedure puzzles me, if he's so freaking good at reversing... why not do just that.
Gr8 example of perfect balance between ‘money cant but brains’ and ‘too ignorant to be scared’.
Lucky for him. Morden cars are straight flat underneath and no longer have a diff since they all use CV joints but it would have been a different story if that car was using rear wheel drive like most commercial vehicles
Okay, before you all being racist and judgemental, looks like he came from back there, and he wants to make a U turn so he uses that inclining road to turn around. Not a great choice, but I bet there's no other choices for miles so he has to do it there. Shame on you all
Fuel rail and other things will be destroyed for the next person who will own that car second hand while he goes and bought another one with mom's extended credit
That mans confidence to just drop his wills off the cliff so many times was crazy
That’s one way to mess the underside of your car up.
Well that was rubbish!
Just ned the benny hill miusik😂
My street is a narrow dead end. I allllways see people doing 10 point turns instead of just reversing out. People are npcs
I call stitch up. I reckon this is some gun mad arsed driver we will never hear of proving a point to some haters. He knew exactly what he was doing the whole time.
Would have been easier to go through the hill😂😂
This guy is somehow simultaneously the worst driver of all time and the best driver of all time.....
😂
Obviously cgi
He is well
Some people will do idiotic things instead of doing what's logical: just reverse the bloody car! He's doing this for the video.
rear wheel drive ftw
How do these people even live any time at all?
Why is backing up so hard for people!? 😅 These days we have the mirrors (plenty) AND cameras. I just don't get it. If you got there going forward YOU CAN get back in reverse.
😂 A phobia for reversing 🤔..  Rever-si-o-phobia 🤣👌🏾.. if that's not what it is then that makes absolutely no sense 😅 a 600 point turn hanging off a ledge 😂
An easier way would be to just continue going down that narrow road in reverse until he got to the bottom.  I don't know why he decided to go from reverse to forward on that 1-lane road.
Asians in cars
Should a bought a Subaru
Impressive Honda
.    *Right before he did this someone said, "I bet you can't turn around on that road."*
His drivers licence should be taken away for life
He spin 12 right steering  wheel turns 🛞 and 11 left turns on the steering wheel freaky "you turn " u turns,🤔 freaky video started with the wheel literally left turned  0:02  and did 12 reverses and 12 forwards 2:55 ?????
Someone said too him if you reverse you're gay
Imagine he forgot something and has to go back
Imagine the look on the face of the poor mechanic who has to check the bottom of the car in a few days when things stop working properly 😞
is this a new asian sport ?
Reminds me of this quote from a pilot: “A superior pilot uses his superior judgment to avoid situations which require the use of his superior skill.”
Started out laughing at him and by the end I was rooting for the dude. That was impressive!
Guessing his car doesn't reverse...
I thought it was a Tesla at first but realised it couldn’t be as it wasn’t on fire
Very impressive
Here's a little instructional vid on how to fail and win at the exact same time
I occasionally have nightmares like that.
What kind of sorcery is this?
Why didn't he simply back up the hill to begin with?
I can’t believe…he owns a Honda Crosstour.
New term coined - 'Stupid Genius' !
Greatest "3-point" turn is history....
Is this the literal definition of strewth?
Dude, we NEED MANY MANY MORE REVIEWS FROM YOU OZZY MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
That’s just stupid good skill but totally unnecessary, JUST PUT IT IN REVERSE BOSO AND THE FACT HE KEPT AT IT WAS MIND BOGGLING like he didn’t realize in the first 2-3 maneuvers that he probably should just put it in reverse lmao than have his car scraped and dangle half way over a one story fall!!!  Wtf
I think it was a bet. Because he is a good driver..
He is so good driver that he was able to make that turn in NOT ENOUGH space, but he was not able to reverse back down😂
But why.
Every Asian woman in a Costco parking lot on a Saturday
Some impressive manoeuvring, but perhaps buy a car with a reverse gear, next time?
Why in the world didn’t that red car just back out??
'How to drive good'... carry on up that hill and find somewhere wider than 10ft to turn round.
This perfectly sums up the style of driving I found in China. Drivers weren't always the best at thinking ahead and usually lacked what I would call "car control," but they all knew exactly where every square inch of their car was. The bus drivers especially are terrifyingly good at driving in tight formation.
Wow! Like everyone else I was just waiting to see him smash himself and the car down 40 feet, and into oblivion. Somehow I have mixed emotions: elated, and yet cheated at the same time.
What a show off! Nah, I was totally impressed. Great driving.
Incorrect on the judgment.  Judgment is a necessary thought process
This guy gives Austin Powers a run for his money!
what does a SteveOh have to do to get more Mazza!!
Omg. I was 100 percent waiting for it to go over backwards or just get hung up.
I'm just thinking of how he even got there. It's like he loaded in a random save file on GTA and just spawned here.
Typical Chinese, cars  ohhh uhhh whitchout reverse . What a quality 👏
Really need a review of rhinoceros spready !!!!! Vids called baby rhino loves a good brushing
When you just hate reversing....😂
Jeez. Well. I guess a little treatment to those side skirts to prevent rust and he's a okay.
Can no-one back up? It's just as easy to go forward.
This is me when my wife changes her mind for the 378th time. We aint going nowhere.
Why didn't he just reversed
Wtf 😵‍💫🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This could be an ad for "anything is possible"
What a comeback
How much are reapirs on the car to let it keep falling in the frame like that
That car is now for sale, full franchise service history so you know it was well cared for

I can totally see this becoming a car commercial down the road.
People. Please dont do this in a rwd. Awd and fwd can pull this off 😂😂😂
Idiot is a word that immediately comes to mind.
Why not just driving back? Wtf?
This is the most genius driving I've seen while at the same time the most stupid.  Man literally forgets he can just backup the way he came, like that's a task cars just can't do.  Then proceeds to do the most precise tight maneuvering ever
Let's imagine the thought process of hating backing up so bad .....  back down the hill or risk death ...... death it is 🥴..... how mental does one have to be , to attempt a stunt like this 🥴
That was excruciatingly painful to watch 🤕🥸🤓
Obviously, he did all of this on purpose - just to create a funky video that will drop some jaws. If not, he is clinically insane.
At this point the car was thinking "why the fork I wasn't born as AWD".
This is actually just a really skillfull driver! Most good drivers wouldnt be able to pull this off.
I have seen many videos like this from Asia, I dont know if they get into situations like this quite often, but these are mostly educational from their end
He was definitely showing off. Someone must have asked him can you turn the vehicle around on that path and he must have said yes easy pesy
this is the reason why we have double unbroken line
The stereotype lives on…
Mission level reverse.  Difficulty level selected : impossible
There is now way he actually got out of this, crazy!
Honda... The power of dreams
Looks like this guy drive up a footpath…
My old girlfriend used to live in a block of flats. The cars all were parked directly underneath.  Basically, you drove up the driveway and turned right into your particular parking spot. There was an Asian lady who must have been scared of breaking the steering if she turned the wheel too far. Every time she wanted to drive out it was forward and reverse just like the guy in the video, back and forth, at least ten times before she was out far enough to go down the driveway My girlfriend's flat was directly above this lady's parking spot, so we got to see her do this quite often.  One day I was sick of it and went downstairs to help her. I tried to be friendly and leaned in and turned the wheel the correct amount and got her to reverse out. Then I straightened the wheel and stood back. She was "Thank you, thank you, thank you." Then she drove off, I went back upstairs shaking my head, although thinking I had solved her problem. No, next time she did exactly the same as she always did. 😂🤔
This might be the first time that I have been absolutely impressed by somebody doing incredibly stupid 😂
Wow...nice ❤❤
Yes but he was farming XP
लेवड़े बैक करके ही ले जाता नीचे.
Everybody in China is a first generation driver
...........         No fucking way...
Imma say it, imma say the hard r
Kudos to the all wheel drive system on that car!!! That is impressive!!!!
Typical.  This guy is probably a brain surgeon.
Genius 🎉
Game Difficulty: Easy, Normal, Hard, Extreme.....Naaaaah . This guy plays at ASIAN difficulty
Look at that rust.
He can reverse it rather than all this effort
The amount of wtf man. 🤣🤣🤣
Good thing he knows how to use those mirrors
Asian driver's no survivors
Hes Probably a university professor.
A+ student at Austin Powers school of u-turns.
All he had to do is put it in neutral and roll back down the hill.  What a genius he is.  I wonder what his mechanic will have to say about this lol.
Literally how my mom feels when I “park too close” in the driveway
When people say that they need AWD, they probably drive like this
Bahaha that was both incredibly stupid and impressive at the same time lol, anyway love the commentary as always!
That's Thai driver.
The confidence of this man.
This just wouldnt be the same without the Australian narration.
I cannot believe this guy managed to actually turn that car around!
Stupidity and the will to accomplish the unnecessary collide.
To people who asked why did he not reverse down the ramp: Pssst, to face a dead end blocked by 2 cars at that too! Imagine him doing another 2000-point turn to turn away from the dead end down the right ramp 😂
Camera man (maybe he`s wife ) also deserves kudos. If this would have taken place in a railway tracks and a big fat train is coming , this awesome cameraman would have let the nature take it`s natural course.
Funny guy
My goodness this is just gonna Embolden him 😂😂😂😂
Apparently he doesn't have very good back up skills. Still..
You review pallas cat hunting
Imagine the moment the driver said to the cameraman “where’s my money? I won the bet” and the cameraman weasels out of paying
If it were me, and I'm glad, you're glad, we're all glad it's not me. I'd be cursing up a storm! He going to do another 20 point turn to go down the hill
Dudes mastered the death road sim blind folded 😹😹😹
It would have been a lot more impressive if he *hadn't* got into this mess in the first place. But then, common sense is boring and therefore grossly underappreciated.
This is like the Chinese version of rock crawling
I have the impression he did it just to show off his skills.
He should've used his mirrors to STAY on the path.
This was surely a wtf moment, but... 🎉😂
Just slam the car into reverse and hope for the best. 🤞
No unskilled driver would be brave enough to allow the back wheels to nearly go completely off the edge of a cliff.
If the guy wanted to go back down they could had just reversed straight instead of trying to U-turn into the mountain. It’s unbelievable these people exist all over the world and come in all shapes and sizes and colors, gender, age and all classes of society
Why didn't dummy just put it in reverse.😳
I cannot believe this worked 😂
Plot twist: he does this every day dropping his kids off at school.
Literally going "naw yeah naw yeah naw yeah naw" as the ad plays, then the video starts. Felt like attempted communication.
He just wanted to show his skills.
Haha a car with no reverse gear??? Well you could roll back anyway. Love how he is so calm while trashing the underside of his car
So backing out the old fashioned way was way down on the options list???
Well, what do you expect?
Why not just reverse?
reverse gear was invented in 1905, people before 1905!!
Wow, typical tesla driver.
This video was STRESS!
Why do it the easy way when have the opportunity to complicate everything?
I think the Grand Final loss has Broken Ozzy Man... He has not been the same since. Hang in there Mate...R U OK?
Impressive, I kinda wanted him to fall, but that's OK 👍 😂
I'm conflicted about his car handling skills. Most people won't get into that position, but most people can't get out of that position. Good for him, I guess, considering that he's Asian!
I am so stressed out.
How to drive good? Well, firstly: don't do idiotistic things just go backwards down the ramp...
When your life is too easy and u r looking for a real challenge...
Ok step out of the car susan , let me fix it .
Because China
Car got stuck and found out 🤷‍♂️
Reverse gear was introduced in cars in 1905 People before 1905:
I'm just glad they made it.
Real Time 4wd. If you know you know.
When you’re a talented but have bad decision making
He didn't scratch the front bumper but his car undercarriage is wasted. That's a win 😂
I miss the part where that's driving good, he just needed to reverse 😒
Explanation for not reversing I’d say is it’s a Honda promotion video 😂
Why not driving backwards in the first place?
wtf
My face was full-on Jackie Chan wtf meme for the solid first two minutes of whatever the hell that just was.
Don't do meth kids.
This is the guy whose legs came first.😮
Tires : ruined Rims: ruined Suspension : ruined Exhaust: ruined Rocker panel : ruined Reverse gear : saved.
LMAO, my initial thought was to reverse, but I'm impressed that he actually did it.
Some just don't like doing it the easy way. They're in it for the challenge. And it's a rental.
You can tell by the conditions of his tires that thias is not his first rodeo.
I think he's done this before...
How the hell.... And why not just reverse?!🤣
Never underestimate how stupid people can be. As for you oz man, how do you not judge this
I'm really impressed nothing exploded or get fire.
Such a roller coaster of emotions honestly. Also, why not of just revered down.
My dad used to drive like this all the time after a bottle of whiskey
The power of the Honda crosstour!!!!
DWA
Can you imagine them flying planes?
But now the road ahead is blocked by two cars and he has to turn around again…
Where we’re going we don’t need roads or brain cells.
Me when the rental doesn’t have a reverse camera.
Everyone asking “why not reverse?” Because that wouldn’t be worthy of an Ozzy Man review, that’s why!
Stereotypes exist for a reason.
I sure do hate that guy.
I have zero context here, but I can't help but ask: couldn't he have just reversed from the beginning or did he lose a bet or something?
The ultimate Austin Powers move!
A terrible idea, perfectly executed.
When you challenge the dude that maxed out his vehicle stat and mains 4WD:
Good driving? Not
That's not skill .... that is silly-kill
Is it awd?
sorry, but if you drive good, you wouldn't be in that situation to begin with...🤣
Just back up! How hard could that be?
A lot of drivers don't know how to back up. Maybe he was one of them.
Nooooo! Not the crosstour!
Just back down, instead of this 587 point turn
Hello Sir, my name is Ibrahim, am from west Africa. I am looking for an influancer to help me tell my story on how UNICEF took away my 3 daughters and my dog from me and left me on the street in a foreign country. I realy hope that you will listen to me. Thank you.
They're Asian. How shocking.
How did we get into this situation 💀
I keep saying yea no yea no yea I watch these vids to much. Most people are like why? I’m like Facking ozzy man. 😂😂😂😂😂
this had to be a bet
Who recorded this???
His lucky it was front wheel drive and a Honda and not a Ford or some American crap
Wet noodle for a brain.
I find myself left feeling deeply disappointed with the final result as seeing him wind up balancing in mid air, Italian Job style, would have been a far more satisfactory outcome.
There has to be a good reason as to why he didnt just reverse out of there. There just has to be
Try that in a manuel/standard vehicle
He made a dumb decision. Then pulled it off. Now You know this guy thinks he’s the best driver in the world.
I'm pretty sure he has driven in that position on purpose, considering he has a camera man with him and the fact I saw several similar videos presumably from China. It's almost as if Asian people try to show the whole world they're the best drivers.
You can see that they cut away rocks and dug out the hillside a bit just so that they could make this video.  The things people do for views is just ridiculous.  Go get a real job.
Asians
Utter f**kwittery and amazing skill combined. And it looks like he didn't even scatch it
Un-fecking-believable. Amazing the way you get YouTube videos showing how amazing the human race can be  doing triple somersaults whilst firing arrows at bullseyes whilst drinking a pint of beer… then you get guys like this 🤦🏻‍♂️
He's what we call in the uk a few sandwiches short of a picnic absolute 🤡
Now while yes I do think there was an easier solution to this problem , I respect the fact that he doesn’t take easy paths and to his credit he pulls it off almost perfectly... I do however want the last 3 minutes of my life back because this whole thing could’ve been done in like 10 seconds
Methinks he has practiced this turn exhaustively on terra firma with just 20 cm curbstone until he mastered it. Then placed his camera bro uphill and filmed it aiming for Internet glory. In short, I completely doubt this was an improvised event, otherwise he would have backed down, of course.
Who says Asians are bad drivers?  lol
Probably a rental.
What a wuckfit in that car lol. It blows my mind how he decided to turn the car around rather than just backing back out of that slipway
He was obviously demonstrating (showing off) how impressively (he can drive) he can turn his car around on that horribly dangerous narrow road (I dont have the guts to try that ever).
Why reverse when you can destroy your car and make a YT video?!
I'm surprised that he didn't fall 😮😮
mint condition brand new honda for sale
FYI, the R is for Reverse.
very surprised hes Asian...............
He.... he turned around. ..HE TURNED AROUND YOU GUYS
I am extremely perplexed as to why he didn't just reverse 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
What have i just watched? I would love to know what he was thinking, the thought process
Wow. Very impressive. Very very impressive. I would have just reversed back down to b honest and not shown off.
waste
Who else was cheering for this dummy? 😂
Imagine buying a second hand car from this guy.
I would like to follow the thought process of him coming to the conclusion this was the best decision 😢😊
This is another good example of how "turning things around"...
Women when they have to reverse 5 meters:
He def just won a bet from the guy recording.
Either he managed to un-shrivel his sack, or they were so big to begin with, they helped with the cars balance!
He couldn’t go up the hill because someone with a camera was blocking the road. 🤪
Stupid is expensive.
Maybe he  should learn about “reverse”
He has done this on purpose to show off his skills
He told his wife he could do it. She said he couldn't. So.....
200IQ???
HONDA The Power of Dreams
The fact that he did this without entering destination f*cked is impressive...which brings me to my next question...if he was such a good driver that he could do this, why not just back out? Pehaps he was trying to impress a date in his car...or possibly to terrify her?
I drive an 18 wheeler in the US. This is absolute nightmare fuel. The worst part is he actually pulled it off. Either he's that good or stupid truly knows no limits.
Let's take a moment to slow clap and acknowledge the degree of cluelessness it takes to even consider this as an option.
I think he intentionally meant to do this so he could show off his driving skills
Living up to the stereotypes, one trip at a time lol.
WE ALL KNOW WHCHI TEAM HE PLAY WITH SINCE HE DOESN'T LIKE GOIN "straight"
Is that Austin Powers?
when your IQ is negative 200
How to ruin a fine car ( is it hydrogen powered?l
Very worried about damaging the front of the car, the sump guard, exhaust, chassis not so much.
Unbelievable.   And then what?  It was blocked that way.
That was incredible and incredibly stupid at the same time.
Did they not buy the backup camera option. ijs.
You guys are witnessing the honda quality program of going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back. It is the equivalent of the IKEA mattress tester, pressing and releasing, pressing and releasing, pressing hard and ejaculating.  This is asian logic, in contrast to boolean logic. It says that the shortest route from A to B goes via an infinite amount of twists and turns.
Some straight up Chinese drive here
Out of the box thinking...
At first I thought what an absolute idiot and how did he even manage to accumulate enough money to buy such a car. Now I think his level of genius is beyond my realm of comprehension as I watched him break all the laws of the universe.
There's the easy way and there's the right way... Also, there's this way.
The vehicle featured is a Honda Crosstour, specifically a pre-facelift one (2010-2012). My dad owns a 2015 EX-L with heated leather seats, V6 engine, 6 speed automatic and 4WD. The capabilities of these cars are surprising. The 4WD system can pull the car out of crazy situations and the V6 gives it a healthy amount of torque. The suspension is double wishbone up front and multi link in the rear so the ride is supremely comfortable. It's easily one of Honda's most under appreciated cars.
Don't let this guy near your daughters or sisters. You don't want those genes to be part of your family 😂
there's definitely something wrong within his brain
The cameraman is the type of jerk who would sell his mother for a video.
I don’t know who to be more upset at: the person attempting a 100-point turn to drive back down the hill or the person who decided to record everything instead of trying to tell the driver to just simply go in reverse.
why couldnt he just reverse all the way??????????????????? arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ahhhh... its competition who can turn car there. i saw shorter car did it on the same road before
What cant you achieve in a cross tour?
Stay tuned! Next week we'll see him doing it with a RWD car!
Holy smokes the driving masterclass we didn't know we needed!
reverse???
Over complicating a reverse
Straight from the austin powers school of driving
🤯
This guy is good and turning around but shit and think logic
He won the bet for sure
Driver: I bet you I can turn around here! Passenger: I bet you can’t. Your gonna die and I’m gonna record it *exits vehicle… loses bet*  That’s why he didn’t just reverse
Soooo stupid yet impressive at the same time.
pretty sure I've seen this exact spot in some other video, similar to this but with a different car.
I'm starting to think this is how he goes down his driveway every day
OH MY GOD XDDD  Edit: Two thoughts on this: Number 1 - why not just simply reverse?  Number two - second part was impressive anyway! Perhaps this guy decided that from now on he will be doing everything in his life the hardes possible way to man up :D
This is bloody funny
🤯
I'm guessing a  reverse gear is a luxuery option on a Honda?
This person is disrespectful
That's gotta be the best advertisement for Honda I've ever seen in my life!
просто водитель хотел просмотров на ютуб. он получил их
100% a wager, no other explanation..
The only possible explanation for this video is a drunken bet.
😂😂😂 looks like he done this before
Believe it or not some drivers lack the ability to back up straight  enough over any real distance. They lack the  hand/eye coordination from the perspective of the car moving in reverse.
Wow.  When the back wheel was over the edge, I wouldn't think you could get it back up.  Thought that the car was going to be a permanent fixture there.  😂
If this guy breeds…Imagine the kids.
he's the GOAT! but y would u even put urself into that situation in the first place tho
Lucky he had front wheel drive
At A Matter of Life or Death, this Driver Mastered the most dangerous maneuver to reverse in a steep cliff and safely return back to normal at ground clearance.
He knew what he was doing this one,just for the hell of it😂 (maybe it was a bet?🤷🏼‍♂️)
What about the bottom of the car, a small rock can do wonders sometimes
He did on purpose to show he could. There’s other vid like this.
Ye na na na na ye na na na ye yee
Failed succesfully 👍
Im wondering why he did all that to face the direction that the road is blocked.
I'd love to see this footage sped up so it looks like they're drifting.
Wow! Mission impossible accomplished! Didn’t think he’d get that round. High five 🙌
Just one mishap and this video could have end up in destination fucked series 😂😂😂😂
I was SOOOOOOOOO FKN FRUSTRATED WATCHING THE FIRST 20 SECONDS THAT AFTER I FINISH WRITING THIS IM SWIPING
The chasis and suspension were sent to destination f**ked!
Was this some kind of bet?! I mean great job pulling it off, I guess. 😐
“I’m not comfortable reversing”
Legend said he still searching for Reverse Gear..
Definitely a bet.
I'm surprised it's a man
He could have just reversed.
WHY I meant WHY WHY HOW IS THAT EASY ANSWER.
In Chyna getting a fake driver's license that says you learned to reverse costs more so there's that.
He outrageously dry stirred his way out of destination F
I suddenly want a Honda.
How the fuch was he able to turn? I saw it and still cant belive it
He can get out from there in 5 second if he reverse his car, instead he wasted our 3 minutes
I guess backing out never occurred to him
Rear wheel drive vehicles have left the chat
Next time I buy a used car, I'm checking underneath the car with a mirror.
And the scary thought I had was how often does this happen WITHOUT a camera rolling.  And how often does it go wrong.
I don't know if he is the worst or best driver on this entire planet. I am extremely conflicted. This man is a living paradox.
Why am i not surprised it's a woman
I think That CAR don't have Reverse Gear.
The fact that somebody got out of their car to film this. 😂 I'm not sure if they were expecting his car to flip (as I was at one point), if they had tried to talk some sense into him or if they actually thought he might make it!
Fujiwara Takumi approves the wheel drop technique
KIND OF impressive?? Nah, he’s a Ninja of car turning!
what's more insane is that he looked at the gear stick every single time he went from reverse to drive and vice versa. like you just did it 30 times, you still don't know where r and d is ?
Back the F*CK up! 😂
That's not what front-wheel drive is for...
Should be an advertisement for that car company 😂
He wouldn’t have done it without a front wheel drive
You could do a 114 point turn, or you could just learn how to back up in a straight line. If the blonde in Prometheus can do it, it can't be too hard.
If that guy can turn his life around, you can too!
Yeah, naah... The paint on the nose might not have got scratched, but bouncing any ICE car off its underside (which he did, a lot) generally buckles the sills, wrecks the exhaust pipes, trashes the panel joins, removes the rustproofing and underseal... Very expensive to put right.  If this had been an EV (which it wasn't) it'd be an insurance write-off because of the likelihood of unseen damage to the battery with the danger of a catastrophic fire at some unspecified time in the future.  Yep. Sometimes it's best to hit the RESET button on your driving sim...🤭
Perhaps he is participating in a competition similar to Trials Riding, but for Honda Civics or whatever.
Someone who can manage that many a point turn hanging off a wall can surely reverse pretty well? What an absolute nutter
My admittedly uneducated opinion is someone else, maybe the camera person, got the car stuck. This hero stepped in and got the car unstuck. This senerio explains why the clip starts with the car in such a f'ed up position when he is obviously a skilled driver.
nothing weird at all, the original author of the video makes many of those like this one, from China, just to prove that's possible and how.
How in the actual f*ck did he get out of that? I'm simultaneously impressed at the stupidity and the determination.
he made this so incredibly difficult for himself 🤣
Imagine that car with a good driver! Wow.
But can he parallel park?
I’m trading in my truck for a Honda whatever that is.
duh of course its recording to show the dude can complete turnaround
Wow....just wow!
Surely..... This Driver won a Bet.......?
Reversing is boring  —— the driver
Drugs
I’ve shown this to my grandpa he said he couldn’t wait to see them with flying cars 👍
Proof positive asians shouldn’t drive
I'd have just backed up maybe?
That's actually really impressive he got out of that shitmix, cause he fuqd that all the way up lmao
Yeah nah nah nah nah x 9 yeah na 😂
Why do they suck at driving?
Life's hard. It's harder when you're dumb. He should have just continued backing down. These are the asswaffles we're competing with out there on the roadway
Haven't you  used this footage  before
What was wrong with just a straight forward rverc
the worst part about this is those cars in the background look to be blocking the path.   so he would have been far better off just backing down that then driving forward to leave.   now he has to make another tight turn
A fail so epic we have to salute.  Well done, sir;  that was a gloriously befucked.
this is a good honda ad
My god that's a total win😮!
LMAO. Asian drivers.
How was this photographed ? That must have been set up. That driver was a professional without doubt.
Y didn't he just reverse back down?
BAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
The guy performed a 297 point turn because he couldn’t drive down hill on reverse.
Got to hand it to the guy.  I didn't see him text not one time.  I'm impressed.
New found respect for the Honda Accord Crosstour!! Impressive!
No backup camera?
Hate to think what the underneath of that car looks like 😂
Unbelievable. Completely unbelievable.
He's lucky he was in a front wheel drive.
why
Good God! If he could turn that thing like that, he could've just carefully backed out.
Everyone here clapping and no one talking about how fckd the car bottom probably is 😂😂😂
What Honda car is that??
A task only a bloke can do if it were a WAMON she would have complained on online. 😂😂😂😂
Shortest joke ever: Chinese driver
i reckon he's done that a few times before
he failed successfully
There needs to be a series Asians in cars or would that be too much?
I bet it was a bet he couldn't do it....🤣 Hold my beer and watch this!! HAHA!
Which car is it???
Hope he sells that car fast, the sills are going to rust out really quickly now he rubbed off whatever protection was down there.
As the tattoo says "No regerts"....
It's a honda 😂
Apparently not everyone should be behind a wheel. Funny bits aside, he could have killed himself.
Oh so that is why all Honda cars are so banged up 😂😂😂😂
Does he think cars can only go in reverse a few inches and not all the way back down the hill?
I forgive him too 2:39 😂
Fvcking wowza! About half way in I was thinking he's actually going to make it isn't he!?😄
I'm a bit surprised that he even managed to turn around. I would have assumed backing out the entire way was the only possibility.
A DJI Engineer.
No matter how stupid some people's actions may be, there will always be an expert at them.
These guys do plenty of similar videos. I don't remember the channel name, but these are supposed to be instructional videos showing us how even impossible situations such as the one here can be dealt with.
This hurt my happiness
This is the worst most awesome thing I have seen today.
Bro is the “imma take the stairs” type
QUIET CAREFULLY? Or quite carefully?
He needs to stick to riding elephants ... 😂
Why didn't that effin donut hole just back down?
That was 'impressive'. Shame the bottom of the car is scratched to F....
They call that the 3 to the 10th power point turn.
As painful that was to watch. Thank fuck for front wheel drive.
1:19 Check out the tread on the front tires! 😂😂😂   They look like racing slicks 😅
A bet of beer might have played a important role in this tad manuevre by this bloke.
I would have cried if that was a Mercedes 🤭
Cuz Asians just keeps moving forward
what bet did this guy got into? what was at stake?
They filming a new austin powers? Also why didnt he just go in reverse.
There’s a REVERSE gear in car!! 😂😂😂
😂 peanut brain
Well, that didn't end the way that I thought it would.  Color me surprised.
Why not back down the hill then turn around
He can do this shit but he can't reverse lol
When you don’t know what “R” stands for.
This was completely on purpose to show.. skill? I guess
BuT wHy Diddddnt he jUst RevErse dOWn tHe RoaD?  Well the fact that somebody filmed this might be the first step on the path leading to your answer.
WTAF 😂
The crazy thing is that this is not the first video like this I've seen.
Driver need to think outside the box. Reverse back my G 😂
Austin Powers would be proud!
If you can do this.... you can drive in reverse....wow
I'll take pointless 900 point turn for 500 larry.
Was it better just to reverse
Id say his misses drove it off, and he was there to salvage it. Genuinely stuned he pulled it off. I was cheering him on.
Bad decision, but pulled it off❤❤❤❤❤
When the boys decide to bet
The balls on this guy...
Ozzyman never needs a mic!!! Cannot whisper however.
that was his gran's, he does this every other week. it used to take him half an hour to do..
Really committed to screwing up the undercarriage with this one
fools play expert card and come up with a heroic story.
DWA.  Driving while Asian. Guilty.
Best driving on the Internet
Never confuse poor driving and getting lucky, with skill.   If anything, it's a testament to the capability of the vehicle, not the driver.   Great example of, wreck slow because it hurts less.
It is f#$kwits like this that will make you lose hope in humanity.
Asian drivers, I tell yah. Lol
Human nature in a nutshell, let’s make things more complicated because logic is just boring.
Instead of reversing he decided to risk his life and scrape his car like a million times 😂😂😂
Why didn't he just reverse back😂
Why didn't he just reverse?
Why is the camera man so calm, and where did he come from?
I was told to follow the GPS.
Wtf why would you not just turn around down at the intersection there? 😂
So can be dumb and skilled at the same time
I can't believe he got out of that position. He's still an idiot though for getting there in the 1st place.
There was a bet that happened right before this video rolled.
I'm beginning to think someone dared to do it as a challenge
It's a good thing he didn't have some heavy luggage in the back?  Or a dead body? LMSFAO!
He is an Asian who lived in Florida for a while
Yeh nah nah nah nah yeh nah yeh nah yeh....😂 (Bing ups from Brazil) yeh nah
Open the hatch. Look back through the car.
And then we got a YouTube content just because he didn't reverse all the way down and then we all thought that was impossible till halfway through it.
Dumb question. But will you have some hoodies for sale in your shop?
Logic nowadays.
Who is recording the video ? They need help
If you only knew the amount of damage he caused to the undercarriage. Probably better off letting it fall off and lying about it.
I can think of 4 ways out of this situation: 1. Reverse 2. Shift to neutral and coast backward slowly 3. Say "screw it" and abandon the car 4. Whatever THIS is  Options 1—3 would have been simpler. But hats off to the guy for actually pulling this off.
Benz drivers hit parked cars and Accord drivers can’t drive in reverse.
Life is hard enough without people like this WHO MAKE IT 12 TIMES HARDER and somehow 'succeed' FOR NO GOOD REASON...  And I hit me-self in the head with the car door just trying to get in the other day.
...Nice🔌 " PLUG " for HONDA......BEEPBEEP ! 🚗💨
What the hell
Stupid got them into that mess, and then stupid darned well got them out of that mess...  It has me re-evaluating the validity of the old maxim "If it's stupid but it works, then it's not stupid."
This is both stupid and awesome 😂
So he used the intersection to chuck a U-ey.  He was coming down the main road and realised he needed to be going back up it the way he came and used the turn-off because that gave him more maneuouvre room than trying to do it in the middle of those 1 and a half lanes of traffic.  All very logical.
I thought for sure he was either gonna get stuck or fall off. Props
Honda, is value …
Is that driver ORIENTAL?
Jesus. This guy .. I beg for this car 🤷😐
the two cars watching: "wanna bet?"
And this is why you should never buy a used car. You never know what kind of dodgy shit the previous guy did with the car.
based on the car's license plate this seems to be in china.
And now he's got to do it again to get down the street as up is blocked and he couldn't possibly back down it
This 100% would have been a stunt and completely on purpose
Those tires don't have any tread on them...
i....cant believe that worked.  the world is an amazing place.
And just like that, somebody that should not be driving
🤨🤨🫡
He is so good at the turning around full reverse has left the chat.
definitely a rental
Ridiculous but impressive
clearly the misses got the car in that situation and he got it out, she's in the trunk.
The patience on this dude whenever you think you're at a point of no return...you're really not
What is the repair bill?
Dunno what to say… guess I’m at “lotsa ways to get to the same place”
🤣
I heard when the driver got home he took the elevator to the top floor then climbed his way down to his second floor flat, from the outside
I. Was. Expecting. Epic. Crash. Video. /jk
When your reverse gear fails 🤣
This is what one's ego gets you. STUCK!
He just made something that should have been fairly easy (i.e. just reversing out) a LOT more difficult.  Weird.
I have a good feeling about this driver.
If stupid and genius had a baby
Standard Chinese R&D test from the book. No joke. You got an engineer from Honda at the wheel, and he must prove this to be possible. For some reason, chinese drivers might face situation that requires this to be done in the way you witness.
While most of viewers here might only focus on the car doing 569 point turn, what's crazier is those cars on the background that can't pass each other while there's actually space to do it, being on standstill from the beginning until the end of the video.
This reminds me of my wife, at the same time yelling at me to shut up saying i got this
as a wrecker driver i just have to say thank you cause picking a car out of that would be awful and i would probably get all sweaty
Honda - the power of dreams.
There was an obvious pro who did this same spot a couple of years ago and he filmed it so you couldnt tell how high off he was. This guy was obviously some rando bozo who saw it and said i can do it.  Well he almost completely flipped over. What a clown.
He kept on at it with super patience. I woulda had to get out a couple times to smoke a cig due to the stress level.
He scraped the bottom of the car.
in the beginning I thought something might have gone wrong with his reverse gear... but then if that's so he could still go neutral and get down easily... lol
I am shocked and impressed he was able to get turned around. Amazing.
For those of you confused and raging... These types of troll chinese videos are designed to trigger you. Just for the views, dont take it so seriously.
When Asian Driving and Asian Skill Level collide.
What the actual fuck? Stressing me out and making me feel good at the same time.
When backing back down is just too damn easy
Scary part is that he obviously has done this before.
Anxiety 💯💯💯💯
honda must give him money for the advertise.
How it the f**k did he get into this position to begin with? 😂
I went from laughter and disgust to being genuinely impressed with this unnecessary maneuver
Honda's alignment has left the chat
...why would you not just back up it and drive away normally if you can drive that well.
Amazing to be so shit scared of reversing and then pulling this off
This was painful to watch
i'm actually happy to know that you CAN have both back wheels off the road and still recover.... multiple times. but yes. please just back down straight next time buddy.
Don't go that way they say, reverse they say!
some people in the comments actually thinking this is a real situation and the driver is stupid for not backing up normally. its a stunt video for online content.
Can we just take a minute and thank the camera man because if it was not filmed no one would believe this shit happened.
Impressive videography! I am curious who was behind the camera. A passenger? Or a random neighborhood kid with a smartphone?
It was stupidly that got him in, and out of that situation. Only an idiot could have pulled that off.
You got to mirrors you can try this but cannot back down.
Omg! No ability to back up!
Its funny looking at those 2 other cars up the road likely just waiting to see if he falls,  Also why didn't the guy filming just see him reverse back down safely
How to drive 'good' 😂 omg
Buy Honda😂
How to not speak English well
Maybe the reverse gear is out of order, i mean i hope it is out of order, but it is not... is it? Well humans are idiots.
I'm not normally a spiteful person, but yeah nah I would've liked to see him end up in Destination F, if I'm being honest.
Guy got skills 😂
free Honda ad
at this point he has more than one exhust vent
That was the most impressive driving feat I've ever seen tbh
Being intelligent doen't make you immune to fek'n up.   It's how you react to said fek up that makes you a critical thinker, who is patient, & explores avenues of egress to un-fek your fek up!
The fact he did this without 4wd is even more impressive
Almost brand new, under 1000 miles on the clock, 1 owner...   "Just don't check the undercarriage please"
Reverse down or scrape the shit outta the bottom of the car?......................nah the cars getting trashed mate
Why did he even climb this steep road? Anyway, he ruined the bottom of the car.
Front wheel drive.
this guy cost me money.. I bet that he was gunna fall off.. and right when I expected it to happen, he almost caught himself and didn't get stuck at all.. the bet was almost a stalemate, but he eventually got enough traction to free himself..
He driving a Honda - can’t go wrong whatever the fack you wanna do 👍🏽
that hurt my brain
I hope he passed the test and got his license.
Btw, I want to have a car like that! Whats the Brand?  If it can take such a abuse 😂
Thank god for front wheel drive😜
This is why I don't buy used cars! You just never know what they have been through?
My faith in humanity is at all time low especially for chinese people. Coming from a chinese 😂
This is one video where I’m rooting both for him and against him but then I was amazed that he actually made it out
"You, are going to watch my whole process, of incomprehensibly stupid choices to reach my goal, and I am going to succeed. And with my success, your brain will not release that molecule of feel good which you waited the WHOLE time for"  Sigh... Good for them for making it. I hope they're facing the wrong way down the whole mountain now.
Did he just win a bet?
He is both an amazing driver and a horrible one at the same time
Honda?
All things considered, that is some of the most impressive driving I’ve ever seen.
Keeping the stereotypes alive 😂
So no reverse? C'mon thats just stupid
WTAF have I just watched
How in the Fuck?
Im gonna do it hard way to show what I'm capable of😅
The true go anywhere ability of the rental car
That is actually quite smart if ask me completely pointless but smart. If you dont think so ask yourself did you think it was possible?
Fill in the blank:  "Typical ......... driver."
I must say I am thoroughly impressed he made it and this is a great advertisement for Honda.
The only way this makes remote sense is that someone bet him about $1K he couldn't turn the car around and there was no other way than backing all the way down.
How to not use your brain before screw it up.
I mean it could have been accomplished in less than 30 seconds if he new the basics of science.  He chose to take the hard route.  FAKE!
"Check your mirrors." 😂😂😂
I actually thought that was impossible
Other non-weird as fuck people might have just reversed back down?
Well that was a hard FAIL.. He was so close to making it. Better luck next time buddy. That Darwin Award is still within your grasp with just a little more effort.
Best worst driver ever? Or worst best driver ever?
Clearly that car does have a reverse gear. So.....why?
Honestly, agree 1000% with not judging strangers on the internet. But once I noticed it was a Honda, it all made sense 🤣🤣
Quite right.  a stupid position to get into but he bossed his way out of it.  id have bet a zillion buck he wouldnt make it back down safely.  dont know if that was an AWD drive car but Honda for the WIN!
ive seen the original video. the title was best driver ever. and the description was he took the challenge and proved himself or something like this.
He's done this before with another car, there's a video out there somewhere. Seems to be this guy's party trick.
This has all the telltale signs of a wager or a dare.  Road is blocked off.  Cameraman on the ready.  Driver doesn't even look phased by the rear end dropping off the edge.  There is no other way someone capable of pulling that off was somehow dumb enough to get into this situation by mistake.
Ok I was laughing my arse off at the beginning of this video and by the end I don’t know if life is real or am I in the matrix stewing in a cocoon whilst the machines bleed me dry.
reverse must be broken lol
Thank goodness he had the sense of mind to set up the camera first.
The first guy has the skill to do a sixteen pointer on a postage stamp.... but he can't reverse down a hill?
and that is how you drive a rental.
This guy just pulled a 3-point turnaround without the number 2!
I can't believe he saved that. I reckon the wife put him in that position and then he threw her out so she could film him solving the problem.
Why is he turning on that narrow drive?  I’m just pissed he decided to do this wtf
Was this easier than just backing down the hill
This is some kind of driving paradox.  Simultaneously the worst and best driving that's ever been done.
Nice to see someone else that graduated from the same driving school as my misses! Never use reverse when driving out is possible!
Just because you can doesn't not mean you should!
I am going to choose to believe that this was purely a video made to show off the skill of the driver. Otherwise I cannot fathom why.
Yeah that was his only option.... There was no way that car could just reverse down the driveway a little. No way, fk that... That's for people who can't drive good. Only a man does a 58 point turn and smokes half his front tires off to turn around....   😑     SMH
this is a good advert for Honda
He's only capable of backing up 6 inches at a time.
I'm actually kinda impressed
It's a rental...... it's capable of incredible feats😮
That's the Nancy Pelosi clap right there. I gave him zero chance , but he did it without any damage!
He coulda reversed all the way to his destination by now...
This f***cking impressive actually
The combination of skill to be able to pull that off, while simultaneously being too dumb to just reverse down the hill, is truely a sight to behold...
Thats handsdown the best worst driver I've ever seen!
made in china driving lessons...
Wtf just happened?
Where is the woman who initially put the car in there?
I totally figured he would just drop both back wheels off the edge and be stuck.  Amazement at both the ignorance of not just backing down to begin with, and the actual ability of him and his car to pull off the turnaround on a road almost narrower than the length of his vehicle.
like f he did it
guessing it was a stunt due to the cameraman and the fact he could reverse.
He is the type of guy who came to this world from the back door
I can't believe he did it with bald tires 😮
The  video is idiotic ...he could have just keep going in reverse..there wasn't any reason fo 9879889 time turn
Clearly done for the clicks
The best and brightest.
That's me trying to turn my life around 😂
Those tires looked kinda bare...
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I couldn't do this with that saloon on that normal road thats present in video
Still not as impressive as swapping wheels while driving on the highway.
How to Talk Well
To be fair not many of us would attempt to recover from that.  What should be remembered is that at some point he sold that car.
That was sheer fluke he managed to complete the maneouvre. He didn't deserve that luck because reversing down the ramp and doing an 8-point turn at the bottom would have caused less damage to his car.
He's obviously attempting to negotiate a 20-point turn.
Yeah, na. A def w. Well done.
Ha actually did it !
If I was a Honda executive I would use this clip as a marketing video for the car . It was pretty damn impressive that it was able to do it props to the driver of course
The biggest fuck up was not to use reverse.
How could someone skilled enough to pull off this ridiculous turn, not try to reverse out first?
Hold my beer moment.
I would not have believed it If I had not seen it.
Power Steering Pump commercial right there.
As dumb as this was, I cannot believe it worked, I almost have respect for them in a way that makes me feel a little disgusted with myself.
എടാ എടാ എടാ 😂
I don't have anxiety, but after watching that I sure as hell do now!!?! Talking about 10 years of stress in your shoulders in about 3 minutes worth of watching...
I need therapy after watching this
He's the special type of idiot that chops down a redwood to make one toothpick and wastes the rest.
WTF! How ever he made...
No reverse in that country's cars apparently.
He clearly has the driving skill to JUST REVERSE OUT.
This is the choice made by a ADHD human
As an Asian driver, I have to say, “yes”
I physically aged watching this video. Bloody hell.
He was stupid in a clever way 😀
Reverse is probably broken... but wait... it can't be!
Another specimen with strong Austin Powers comedy vibes! 🤣 This is an example of why maths is fun - with so many individuals, populating the planet, chances are well in favour of someone recording "insufficiently proficient behaviour", and posting it to the inter-webs - as kind of a funny lesson in "how to hoo-man". 😅
all it would take is 1 gust of wind for that car to tilt back
"I bet you that I can turn the car around and drive down nose first". No chance!!!" "Hold my (non-alcoholic) beer"
Nearly made the destination f^€ked cut ! 🫡🫡
My feet strts to perspire watching this😯
Literally just reverse out haha wtf why would you for for the full 360
Decision making bad.  Control of vehicle good 👍
Pinch welds? We don't need pinch welds where we're going..
Now let's see the state of his sills underneath...
Come on people, pretty much ANYONE could've gone back in reverse, but he showed that in a scenario where you cannot go back in reverse, you still have an option. Of coooooourse the self acclaimed wise-heads will pop-up saying that _anyone_ can go back and forth and back and forth like he did. Well, to those I say - I'm QUITE sure that many wouldn't have done it as successfully as he did. Wether intentional or not, HE showed you a way of doing things, that many, OBVIOUSLY, label as stupid, or insane. In the way he pull it of, I ask you - who's the real foul? So show a little appreciation - a state of existence, that would put a meaning to your miserable existence. As Ozzy Man said - influencers are intoxicating the world so stay away from them. I DO.  Cheers.
I just have to believe that a couple of buddies were drinking makgeolli and one of them started bragging about the turning radius of his car, and.....
Land Rover: can't do it.  Honda: Hold my sake.
When the car is ment to replace the tiny Pen... and the tiny Brain......
Im going to be torn in two about whether this was good or bad. But im still laughing regardless 😂😂😂
Guys it was probably a bet lol... If he could turn
reversing out was simply too dangerous i guess 🤣
How did he make that?!
this is a whole different lvl of flexing. dude was like 'yeah nah yeah' to reversing.
Why not reverse down!!!!???
That has to be the most Rube Goldberg three-point turn in history. 😂😂
The only thing left to see now are aliens, total shocker
That was the most dumbest way to turn a car around ever by any man.😂
Another reason to own a Honda.
I rather spend my luck points on something else thank you.
Why didn't he just reverse down... That would have been easier and simpler.
I have a deep dislike of this driver. I don’t know why, maybe he’s an alright fella, but there’s something about the way he constantly checks his rear view mirror whilst dangling half his car off a ledge that makes me irrationally angry
How TF can someone make the worst possible decision at every single point and come so close to complete fuckup so many times yet still make it out. I can only guess he does this a lot.
you can tell he was sponsored by Hoda
This is how Asians drive in America as well, even when they don't need to...
Soooo glad I didn't have to hear the actual sounds this situation was emitting!
He knew exactly what he was doing lol and without experience he would've never tried that.....but for clicks he did it 👀
Skills 100 Intelligence 1
I'm glad I'm not a betting man because I would've lost a lot of money on it being impossible to turn around on that driveway....
Is he a genius for managing to turn here or an idiot because he tried turning here in the first place?
I’ll give him credit, he got himself out of that mess.
How stupid is this?! Whay he did that?! No words!
Vegeta what does his point turn meter say?!
Maybe this is the answer to the Driving Test backlog in the UK. A nice quick 3 minute test.
It's so annoying that everything went well
Saw this somewhere else already and wanted to hear that good Ozzy commentary but I just can’t do it.  I just can’t bear that he did it this way.
This irritated me so much man I'm done for the day
having the skill to do it and the stupidity to chose so... it must have been a bet or something like it... i see no other remotely reasonable explanation!
This guy would probably destroy a house to remove a bent nail
He just watched Austin Powers before going for a drive.
He does this everyday.
I am a loner
Still scraped the bottom of the car at several points though. Would've been more impressive if he just reversed enough that the rear tyres were still taking the weight and not the chassis. Still impressive knowledge of the dimensions of the car though.
The funny thing is that I know exactly where this is from the background and the setting. This is the banana flats of the philippines, which is also featured on the 20 peso bill.  The most famous female tribal tattoo artist also lives in this region of the phillippines. I remember driving on roads like these. The roads on the mountains are so steep and curvy that my mom kept having to tell my step grandfather to watch out that he didn't fly off the roads on the bends!  Whenever there was a steep incline on the road, we had to get out of our jeepney, to avoid the force of gravity from literally toppling it over, due to our sheer added weight.  Just be careful if you ever travel in the mountain by car in the philippines, because it's scary!
Why did he not just reverse?
"I bet you cannot make a U turn in this ramp"
That is an epic turn in the road.
Holy FUCKING Shit! 🤯
What was he lacking, a driving license or a brain?
Did this person learn to drive by watching cartoons and playing video games?
Classic: "bet you any money I can do it" case 😂
Chinese drivers....
I actually nearly cheered for the guy when he got it, not so much for the way he did it though.
Friend with mobile: I bet you can't Ross out of this situation Driver: hold my steering wheel 🎶 I'll be there for you 🎶
Now we know y the sills on imports r all rotten 😂
Its obviously made on purpose, to show what can be done, his calm, he has the skill, he knew he could do it, obviously is a physics student.
Austin powers would be proud.
Reminds me of drivers in my area trying to reverse into a parking spot at the local shopping centre
Screwed the sills, trashed the tyres, knackered the steering pump or reverse 20m? Also it doesn't look like he's going up the hill cos its jammed so he will have to reverse anyway.
Never buy a second hand car from that man, god only knows what it’s been through!
a
If only they drove with that much skill the rest of the time.
Actually very impressive
He'd have been screwed if his car was rear wheel drive
This is freaking hard to watch..I just skipped to the end...
It's an advert for the car isn't it?
👋🤣👉some idiots don’t need to be driving! Period!
There is nothing to be impressed about here. It's just depressing how daft people are.
Brings new meaning to the concept of a "three point turn".    I always throught it was the number of steps.   But number of wheels on the ground seems to be valid too.
As one who drives the big rigs. This proves again, the idiocy of the four wheelers.
Whoever was videoing should have sat on the hood when that tire started spinning.
Don't forget two cars blocking the way forward... Time for another 30point turn 🤭
I still  don't understand why he didn't just reverse in the first place... I would have done that, yea sure no video would have been made about it
This was a bet.  Only explanation.  Dude is elite.
What you didnt see was him turn right at the bottom and get stuck
Oh man I dont know there's any making amends that can be done after that. Probably better to grab 4 fresh faces that dont know anything about your driving history.
Maybe he's one of those men who refuses to back up? Yeah... Someone suggested a great therapist for that problem, right at the top of this driveway. Only it was a massage parlour. He left feeling relaxed...a peace with the world. And still unable to acknowledge the need to back up.
i dont know if he is the best driver or the luckiest driver i have ever seen
In year 3000 he was back on the road!
The new official ambassador of "Never give up. Dont stop believing"
Great work on recovery
It's not how he got there it's how he went back Ozzy.😂😂😂  Wonder if he could pull all that to and fro hanging half way why didn't he reverse? Did he forget his car has a reverse gear? Or Chinese cars only go forward.🤣🤣🤣
Oh I'm judging, I'm judging hard. Should not be aloud to drive for life
Clearly the driver is taken a challenge. They have a whole YouTube channel with pro level dangerous stuff like this.
Can we just acknowledge how well that Honda handled this bullshit?
My Brain: No no NOO! Oh wow! Wtf! How?
Honda needs to start installing reverse gear option on it's driver!
When your eyes are slanted and you can’t see how to back up properly…
Bloody impressive
Faaark that was painful
This was amazing
I believe that not only driving in reverse was a no brainer, the driver is a no brainer too.
Why reverse when you can do 21 point turn!
he _must_ have wanted to be on Ozzy Man Reviews.
Damn, moving heaven and earth to not back down that ramp.
I know what's going on here, but saying it outloud would be racist. Instead I have to point at the registeration plate and the.... Open sidewindow....
Honda commercials have gotten really bizarre.
I’m at a loss.
Ozzy man..I'm new to your channel and I'm OLD...Not old as that bloke that kicked the Brown Snake Right in the Kisser as it was delivering the strike...forced to slither away in shame as that bloke shuffled on past...I'm not quite @ the shuffling stage yet but close...I had to check you out because many decades ago one of my best friends...every day hanging out, chilling, getting into massive trouble for years from Jr. High through High School and a few times my 1st year in college... WTF DO YOU CARE YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF...Simple, although his name was/is Chris he was known as and referred to as OZZY... In the early 80s we had the original Ozzy followed by my BFF Chris Ozzy and now...the reactions and sheet remind me of how much fun and enjoyable life was when it was just 2-3 of my friends, some herbs (I was known as "CUT"...on my stupid graduation hat and everything)...Shocking we lived through high school or didn't lose our freedom...(or at least not for a long period of time at once)...If I wasn't old and been d*cked by my government I would make a trip to West Australia to visit for an hour before I pissed someone off and had my arse kicked...straight to DESTINATION F&@!.... Take care young man
These people drive on the same roads as the rest of us. God help us all.
Tell me why i turned my phone with the car the whole time watching this lol 😂 so much anxiety
Zero profile on those tires but they're hanging on for dear life
This reminds me of how I drive in Asphalt 8😂
Soooooooooooooo, just reversing all the way wasn't an option ?? Did someone forget to tell him/her/she/he/thiy/them/it....
So when he got to the bottom did he have to go right? Some people should never be given a licence.
When he can reverse easilt why hih did so
Holy fuck!
Dont let people tell you that your decisions are bad and will never work, just believe in yourself!
Not gonna lie, I'm sort of impressed
What a graceful way of dealing with a situation that never should've occurred in the first f**cking place
👍😎✊
Complete loss for words. 😮
this video is actually from India. it was from the state of Sikkim. This is one of those brilliant stupid videos you can't hate or love...
The guy doesn't want to reverse one time, but he prefers to reverse many times....
He clearly knows how reverse woks.. so I have no idea WTH he was thinking..
I was expecting to see him flip it.
This driver is definitely a Kiwi
At least we know Missy Elliott wasn't driving
An inch here or an inch there and this would be part of destination f*cked volume 197.   Respect.
He could have reversed all the way,he just make his life more difficult...
1st One: uncle did this on a road to a castle.  (we were sightseeing) except the drop was waaay deeper, like down a ravine of death.
Now thats how you do a 3823 point turn, wow.
That car is more "overland" than my SUV!!!
He's done that before...or did it for a bet 😂
Holy FUCK 😂‼️‼️😂
hongcouver  b c
This mook needs to learn how to back up.
Some said we cannot measure stupid. I believe it.😂
Probably it was one of those Darwinian tiktok challenge.. if you fail you win the Darwin award
Wow
That legit gave me the worst anxiety attack in months.
🤯
There was an easier way but that was amazing.
That was a nice car….Why damage it with ignorance?
I must say this video was a bit a of a disappointment. I expected to see a slow motion, reverse flip into destination F.
The only thing more astonishing than his decision to turn around like this is the fact that he actually pulled it off 😮
When your backup camera fails and you dont understand how to drive with a mirror.
Master class in turning around if you ask me. Pay the man, he clearly won the bet.
I mean the fact that he made it, and the car was able to consistently keep getting the rear wheels back up the edge…. Quite impressive
I was so sure this was gonna end up in Destination F'd from that thumbnail!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The idea is to get out of a seemingly impossible situation. They make loads of these videos.  That was actually some very good driving, he never let both rear wheels (until the end) slip off the wall.
If you just showed me the first 10 seconds of this video I would've bet anything he would fail to turn around. It's incredible that he was able to do it. Honda needs to use this as an advertisement for that car, it was so impressive.
He had Obviously Practiced the driveway with his Rickshaw Previously!🤣
Looks like a purposeful challenge and not just someone who can't back up straight. Why else is there great camera work filming the entire thing? For anyone that watches this and thinks it is an eff-up on the drivers part, you just might lack any kind of critical thinking skills. It might be a mistake, but with every detail in this video it appears to be a stunt. The camera person just happened to be filming on the high side of the hill while cars facing both directions on the road are also stopped and blocking traffic? Stunt for the win anyone?
5.8 million views an only 1.5 thousand people hit the like button makes no sense
sorry man, normally i love your videos but this was only painful. watching a person be totally useless while others just watch is so incredibly eye bleedingly painful
It’s a training vehicle in China 🇨🇳.   I think
I got a mobile tyre shop add at the end of this clip👍🤣
Hahaha love your channel man
That was not the ending I expected 😅
This HAD to have been deliberately showing off for the video. Anyone that can execute that turnaround would have no problem simply backing down instead.
Sir Ozzy, please step up your game sir.  KLR Productions and their Raccoon Federation with the Cat's sharon are getting some viewer shares and trendy algorithm.
I wonder where all his tire tread went
Asian driver…
How is this even  remotely possible?!
Who takes video of this sort of thing?
Someone knew better that the cameraman never dies.
Literally just back up.
I bet this guy could limbo under a rug.
I’m guessing that was done strictly for views. Why else?
Money doesn't buy intelligence.  Real world education vs book smarts.
Finally, how to drive good... All I've ever seen is how to drive bad.
I'm sure someone has asked, but why didn't this dude just back down the drive? I suspect he is performing a dare of some kind and was dumb enough to take up the dare.
Hopefully there's a tyre shop just around the corner
Show off!!!!
Awesome driving skills rescues terrible decision.
Can’t see why don’t go straight back
The Nationality of the driver was not lost on me (Chinese rego plate also apparently). I’m not making any comments about the driver’s IQ btw.  Just an observation. 😇
I think I live next door to one of his relatives!
If he was listening to PIZZA DEATH this would have never happened..... Listen to PIZZA DEATH 🍕☠️. You'll thank me later
Reverse must be broken.
How the fuck did they manage that? Like I'm almost more impressed at how the fuck they got stuck then how they actually managed to turn the car around
now he has to do it again to get down the rest of the hill
This is why I have no faith in the world. How does someone with an IQ of -2 have such a nice car while I can't even afford to survive working full time? My dude, just back up, why try to turn around?
I want to see the second 200-point-turn when he gets to the bottom and the hill and realises he needs to take a hard right. 😀
Almost like he had no peripheral vision
D'oh!
Why didn't he just f-ing back up down the f-ing hill?? Cheers from the Pacific West Coast of Canada.
A man who's goal is to only move forward in life.
When you take the phrase "never look back, always move forwards" too literally...
This is truly a libertarian paradise. A place with enforced laws would obviate this situation.
Hats off to the engineers
I love Orientals ❤ 😁
"A bit of a fuck up...."  YA THINK?!?!? 🤨
Congrats.  Now you're going towards a completely blocked street to where you're going to have to do the exact same thing again, whereas if you had just reversed down the road, you would already be pointed in the right direction.
He's really keeping that asian driver stereotype alive 😂
that was the dumbest thing ive seen today.  but he was too deep to quit and thats something most people dont have
10% impressed 90% disappointed
Lol, I have my suspicions that this guy done this because he could. He actually seemed to have really good feel and control over the car, he could have easily reversed down the hill but didn't.
How the F!?
bros lucky its not a rear wheel drive
that car has more wheels on the ground than that dude has IQ
Wtf was the camera man doing ? Not telling buddy his wheels were of the cliff !!
WOW  why wouldn't he just reverse man
Used Honda for sale, one previous owner, low mileage, well maintained, gently used, clean CarFax.  $32,999
That's some torque
The choices people sometime make during a critical decision, is quite fascinating.
I want that car!!
The front dig was almost epic
Guy woulda been better simply reversing
And that's how you avoid driving into Destination Fuuct.
LMAO Oh gosh, the fact that he didn't just reverse, and turn around on the main road is SO frustrating.
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤔🫡😳
Dude recreated the scene from Austin Powers but with higher stakes... and he somehow made it out
Accord crosstours are fucking legendary
This is a true man. DOES NOT BACK DOWN FOR ANYTHING. 😂
driving is nobodies right
Where is the vid of the turnaround at the bottom of the "driveway"?
That was not even skill that was just bad driving and luck.
I quiet screamed.
Honda … you can do the impossible… be one with the impossible.. and pull of a miracle.. blessed are the Honda ..
Glad he has awd
This is what happens when you use all your skill-points in multipoint turning so you have none left over for reversing.
ye nah nah nah nah ye nah nah ye welcome back 😂
So he thought it would be easier to do 100-point turn on a narrow edge rather than simply backing down the ramp. Genius. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Nah Sh*T! This bloke is just showing off!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video wins the award for keeping the F bomb flowing hilariously
Most people would just back up all the way down. Not this guy though, he channeled his inner Austin Powers.
That turn had more points than Geelong 37.17 (239) against Brisbane 11.9 (75) at Metricon Stadium Round 7 1992.
How To Drive Good - and how to mutilate grammar!
The why seems obvious. To prove that he could.
Holy horseshoes.
That's an AMAZING way to correct an AMAZING fuck up!!
I feel sorry for the person that’s going to buy this car because it’s going to be absolutely mechanically totaled! 😂
Literally doing the opposite of what should be done wow. But also impressed that he pulled it off.
Ja das wurde bei der Führerschein nicht angefragt 😆
Strangely impressive! I wouldn't have made that turn.
Not gonna lie, the stupidity of not reversing aside, it was pretty impressive that he managed it!
Aussies mans views do'n't align with regular Australians
Someone filmed this... Just sayin'
if im being honest this is as impressive as it is absurd
what is he doing? He's beginning to believe.
His petrol tank and exhaust system are completely compromised. Frame or unibody is also tweaked as a result of this. He is also lucky he didn’t go over.
Well executed u-turn.
When you're so scared to reverse...
Thanks to 4×4
Only works with front wheel drive car.
This is anxiety inducing.
.........Reverse has let the chat😐
The camera movements are too professional to be ... it is a stuntman dude!
We've been robbed of a satisfying crash video!
Most Asians would have power reversed it off the cliff, well done sir.
Asian drivers am i right fellas?😂
Solid EV ad, success did happen, in a sense.
I remember we were in Shimla(India) where we took wrong turn and we were in a similar situation but our driver drove cab in revere and we were out of there
🤦‍♂️
In Europe people would honk you to death for not having reverse gear.
I love it when I get that notification saying "Someone liked your comment!" Or "someone has subscribed!" Really makes my day better! Have a Happy Halloween!!!!!!
Are you implying Asian driver can't drive by showing this video?
W T Actual F
Definitely a receiver behind the wheel ...
thats definitely not his car.  only pulled it off because its a honda...
I've liked this video but yeah y not just reverse all the way down y do 300 point turn
Going around the elbow to get to the.....
lol This is China
Meanwhile 2 cars in background couldn't cross in that much space
I would definitely not have guessed the ending of this video by looking at the thumbnail.
His mirrors are pointed at his 🛞
Cant tell if im more disappointed that he put himself into thst situation or impressed that he managed to get himself out in the dumbest way😂
I guess that was easier than just backing down the ramp.
Everyone: “Reverse moron” Me: that was kinda impressive ...
Then he gets a ticket for an illegal u turn. Karma 2.0
Unbelievable
It could have been worse.. could have been raining. (Young Frankenstein)
Maybe he was just killing time waiting for that traffic jam up the road to actually start moving...
When your at the bottom intelligence level of humanity, no at the bottom of any intellligence that has ever existed
3rd vid of the same u-turn possibly from this guy. He has done this in a blue wagon and a white minivan
Were those tires bald?
The power of the mighty H O N D A does it again!!! 😂😂😂
0:36 If only Honda put a REVERSE gear in their Accords. Oh, if only they did that! (lol)  2:10 No no, I get it. This definitely needed to be filmed. However, RIGHT HERE. Look at how much further he could have gone forward, giving him ample room to right this stupid wrong.  And rest assured, he probably did some damage to the undercarriage. Even minor. It's not nothing...
No panicking, just f*cking up in slow motion.
When is the good driving?
Who was it that said Asians were bad drivers? LOL, all he had to do was reverse out
Tourist in a rental car?
How to drive gud:  1 dont crash 2 watch out for that car 3 HOLY WATCH OUT FOR THAT CAR 4 AAAAAHHH 5 AAAAHHH
R .
The dude is a hero. He did it.
This had to be for a bet or something.
Id like to see him do it in a rwd
Thanks!
Bravo.
You know how some people like to think outside the box...yeah this is not that person.
I was honestly rooting for the guy while talking crap at the same time
Insane
Her trans operation was pretty impressive.
He’s a Chinese combat pilot.  Amazing skills.
And this is where I call AAA for a tow, partially just to see What The You-Know they did about it.
The obvious obviously did not occur to him...kill me now
I think some congratulations are in order for Honda here.
I want to see this car on wheelers dealer or a quick reaction of the guy at the "Vehicle inspection pit".
The guy is a stunt driver and has a youtube channel, I have seen a lot of his videos,
What people don't realise is that he reversed up there and then did a 360 turn.
That is some mad skill, but it paid off for him, nice one
Even more impressive considering how bald those tires are
F@#$ that is some skill
I wouldn't do that even if paid a lot...
Gettin into a situation like this would of course be stupid and to solve such a problem in this way is something I would never do. HOWEVER if he did this on a high-stakes bet or is being forced to do this by his child’s kidnapper to prevent its murder, this guy is a   GENIUS GOD   with a SHINY GOLDEN C0CK  of HEROIC PROPORTION.
That's a lot of work to avoid reversing a short distance down a minor slope.
He could have just reversed out the street...good effort yes.
I've never experienced so many emotions within 3 minutes! I'm with some of the comments below, I want to see him parallel park!
Inquiry: ....What the hell was the point of this?
You have Fn gotta be kidding me...
From the damaged rocks we can tell this was not the first attempt. They practiced a lot, probably only to make the meme. Totally useless, just reverse mate...
Oz Man please do more content like you used to like the skits of you talking as the animals and people +a flippy and a spready to the God's it really gets me in a good mood instead of destination fucked for the week, when you done 30 minutes of gold was the bomb 💣 😂 please 🙏🍀🇮🇪🤪✌🏽
I don’t know whether to be horrified or impressed!
I’m so confused. The damage to the underbody just to do the dumbest most pointless point turn. This is definitely something.
Nice ad tho
This idiotic manouver was made by purpose of the video, i'v seen similar ones. Dosn make sense , like youtubers burning cars, but here it is, the modern internet content
This guy does this all the time, he has a channel, and all his videos are of him turning around in crazy situations.
I have a strange admiration for a guy who tries a 3-point turn on a road half as wide as his car is long.
Captain Obvious here. He did what he did on the video just to show his driving skills. Of course he could've easily backed up but nobody would watch that kind of video and make comments of how stupid the driver is and feel good about themselves 😂
The balls on this guy to even think he could turn around
who is filming this first one and not helping the driver at all. Just filming the whole thing for laughs?
If he can't reverse, all he had to do was take his foot off the brake and let the car roll straight back. It looked like it was only about 12-15'. That would be better than joggidy jogging it over the edge and ruining your chassis. That was so stupid and dangerous it had to have been a bet.
How??? Just..how????
Bad driver but great car, I am very supprised it was able to get grip!
I'm very impressed! That Honda's got some balls.
Is it just me thinking that one driver got it stuck trying to reverse out of there. Then another one said look mate youre going to fuckin fuck this, ket me do it, took over and saved the day?
Impressive!
Now we know why he has bald tyres
The mad lad actually did it.  I'm simultaneously impressed and confused as to why he didn't do that at the intersection.
Fully expected that to go straight to the next Destination Fucked edition - proved me wrong
I just want to know the backstory to this cuz I'm pretty sure I've seen another video, of a van doing the exact same thing on the exact same road before.
we're not going to make it, are we? People, I mean
now do that with a manual 💪
My first thought: why doesn't he just reverse?
Damn Asians lol
I saw this in the first Austin Powers movie, I think.
He drove a much greater distance in reverse, albeit tiny increments, than if he'd just backed down the hill. He's trying to win a bet.
.. I’m gonna board slide this
That video was truly incredible.  Incredible stupidity combined with incredible driving prowess.  Maybe we are all missing the point though, maybe that man just wanted to show us how much of a "fair dinkum expert" he was to get an Ozzy Man Review.
That is simultaneously both the worst and best piece of driving I have ever seen. Kudos to that man
Judging by his confidence, its not his first time
This man makes money like this ... I am talking about our ozzy boy here haha
"Many Australians do." 😆
Yeah, I'm at a loss for why he just didn't back out, too.
Why didn't this dude reverse back down?
Sure hope it is a rental.
I Never understood why people think that their vehicle's are not much wider around themselves while sitting in there car's seat. Seriously, they think backing up "carefully n slowly" in the stupidest direction possible will make it work out perfectly........ 🙄  Sadly Common Sense just isn't Common anymore, it hasn't been common in many year's now.. 😞  Godspeed to all those car's that got destroyed by these savvy driver's.  👍😎
3:10 Yes that was much easier.
I'm guessing that they do not teach you how to reverse down roads in where ever the F this is??
That was the most stressful 3 minutes I've had all year. Cheers, Ozzy Man!
DAmnnnnnnnnnnnn :D
Obviously this asian driver was attempting to prove a stereotype wrong. Then again, just backing up would have saved him 2:45 so point not yet proven.
This Patient guy deserve the most biggest cookie of the World.
Is it wrong that for the entire video I was chanting "Dar-win, Dar-win, Dar-win"? 😂😂😂
1) it's staged 2) if not...WHY?????
He made the turn.
I started thinking "why?", ended thinking "how." Impressive
If he could do all that he should have easily just backed down!
Why didn’t he just reverse lol😂😂😂😂?!?! Why?!?!?
People commenting on here calling him an idiot.....anyone that can execute this manoeuvre is perfectly capable of seeing that they could just reverse the 10 metres that had driven up a hill. The original video was obviously done this way to show off or prove it could be done not because he's an idiot. It just makes you look like an idiot for nothing thinking about this.
Just so many questions on this one...
well nobody can say that guy is a bad driver...that was really impressive.
just back up ... they put it in the car for JUST this type of situation ... 🧐
Talk about raising anxiety levels through the roof
Why didn't he just reverse down the hill? I'm willing to bet that it was because of a bet or dare.
very skilled but yea I agree, why not just back up?????
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🥵😃💕👍🏾😃
And the world is getting dumber by the day!
Why the fuck didn't he just reverse all the way down??
What in the world did I just watch?
Or he could have just driven down to the bigger road and done that in a 3point turn
That is incredibly stupid and incredibly impressive all at the same time!
I'd like to see them try with rear wheel drive. No LSD
“Ancient Chinese Secret “ 😭😂
I wonder how often that stunt had been attempted that day… notice the nearly swept-clean aspect to the side of the pavement where his front tire was spinning, and notice also the freshly chipped/powdered/scraped white rock faces along that same side of the road.
I think he did it just to get on Ozzy Man Reviews.
I’m thinking someone else dufffed it and He’s the “turner”.  They bring him in for specialty situations like this.  He turned it from Destination F@$kd to Destination Perfect.  Bravo, Turner guy.  Bravo.
Plot twist:  gets the car straightened out, then reverses UP the hill
With those wheels so worn something tells me he’s done this before 🤔
I feel like the only thing missing from this video is someone yelling, “HAMMMONDD!
Cue standard Asian driver stereotype jokes. That car must have excellent traction control software, or perhaps four wheel drive.
I would revoke his license not congratulate him. 😂
Why didn't he just roll backwards?
1000 point turn.
Driving instructor: Demonstrate a hundred point turn!
I'm very concerned why they didn't just reverse
This is so stupid. I have seen others do the turn on very narrow roads like this. The difference is that they made sure to do the turn WITHOUT damaging the undercarriage. When you do shit like this, damaging the car,  just for clicks I am not impressed.
Mental.
Great ad for Honda!!  Holy shit 😳
10 Accord Crosstour 🥺 shouldn’t get it stuck 4wd to
😂💀
I had to do that exact thing on a high, snow-covered mountain road a few years back. Major pucker factor activated.
Darwinism at its finest.
He's so bad at driving, he's actually good!
This should be a commercial about the benefits of all wheel drive.
That undercarriage 😱
By the looks of the rock wall in front of the car, its possible it wasn’t the first time.
I guess he could have reversed out but there would not be a video then.
I mean, he could've just backed down the hill like a normal person...
Pull back game is extremely weak.
Legend 😂😂
At least the driver didn’t attempt to rotate that car and change his direction in an opposite fashion with the front end over that overhang.  Regardless, the driver possesses skill and simultaneously is an imbecile for not just simply reversing and getting underway again.   Either way, job done👏🏾👏🏾, hope the car was a rental.
My gf in a nutshell. Making the simplest things hard af.
Damn lucky that car is front wheel drive
This Guy knew exactly what he did. Well, I'm sure that this Guy didn't brought the car in this position. As ozzyman said: grandparents can have an exotic drive style . . .   Wifes too
The driver has/had a youtube channel with all sorts of situations like these where he shows how to get out of them.
The human race is on the clock.
Car model name?
🥠
Looks like a dare lol or a really mean driving instructor
nightmare fuel
Why. Not. Just. Drive. Down. In. Reverse???
All I see is Austin Powers with a modified golf course
That was painful to watch.  Speaking of grandparents—I can only hope this guy never starts dating my granddaughter.  I’d rather she stays safe.
"Imma gonna make this u-turn, no matter the cost! ... does anybody know the cost of undercarriage replacement and a new set of tires?"
All those people saying why didn't he just back down. Obviously he made this video to prove he could turn the car around in that tiny space and he did it.
I was completely dumbfounded all the way through this. From the how, to the why, to the what the F’! Truly impressed.
I guess he only asked himself if he could, and not if he should...
This dude just wanted to be in an Ozzy Man video.
doesn't that car have a reverse camera?
Why wouldn't he just reverse down instead of doing a 1 million point turn?
Was there any tread on them tyres?
He tah-fuckin-dah-ed it!
I wondered why my insurance premium went up this year
Probably his normal morning commute. Blasting Road to Nowhere from Talking Heads, Double Espresso in one Hand, effortlessly 180 turning with the other. Off to Work.
I love how the road ahead looks blocked by parked cars, so he'll be doing the same move in less than 10 seconds🙃
He probably has a back up camera too.
Off to take over the world next.
Might have been a publicity stunt.  Can't imagine such a skilled driver does not know reverse or even know how to ask a bystander for help.
Why didnt he just back up tho
That was both equally idiotic and impressive at the same time!
Success is the best deodorant!
Yea😅 even reverse was not required, car could have gone down itself on neutral
Worst driver in the world makes the best turn in the world.
Isn’t reverse not an option? 😅
God I was cackling so hard watching this clip. Geez.
Wow. He drives like my X!!!
I can't imagine the damage to the rear end. Might get lucky with some cosmetic damage,  and hopefully the drive train is inset underneath
Well, there's your problem. DWO!
Rear cameras are overrated anyway.
It seems he doesn't like reversing more than 20 cm.
surely this one was done as a bet or a dare no one is that stupid to not reverse .
How the Hell do you get to the point where the video started in the first place? Dude couldn't find a better spot to turn around? Or maybe this was staged, but still how do you even end up like that on purpose? 😄👍
You can't turn around on my driveway!.....Hold my mid-strength beer!
This is the best Honda advert I've ever seen.
Gymkhana in slow mo
Maybe he tried backing down and the rear got stuck so had to go front first for better clearance?
i thought he was screwed when the front wheel couldn't get traction, but he made it!
What ? I say again...WHAT ? What the hell was the point ???
So hes nasty enough to turn around on that ramp half hanging off, but he cant just simply reverse back down??
Sincere honest mistake 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is the equivalent of asking a math professor what 2+2= and getting a dissertation. The answer may not be hard but I am impressed with how he got the answer.
Just fuckin reverse it dawg
I think he attempted to make the climb, but those tire/tyres are so bald they did not have any traction.
This was simultaneously the worst and best driving I have ever seen.
He was probably trying to go backwards, but messed it up somewhere in the middle.
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
Never trust google maps!
Yeah reversing on a straight line would have been quicker and simpler but are you😂
When I got my drivers' license -- hundreds of years ago -- one of the things I had to do to pass the test was to back up along a curb for about 50 feet. The guy obviously knows the car can go backwards ...  I'm gonna go ahead and guess that this was done for clicks.
When Vtec kicks in😂
Where exactly is this DMV driving test administered? Mine in California only required a Y turn on a street with plenty of room to pull it off. I have to admit at 16yo, in the mountains of Chile, in my parents car, I'm not so sure I'd have passed my test.
driving tests have gone really hard now 😀
legend status unlocked...
But why?
Held my complete focus and attention the entire time even though have ADHD & high af!
My lord why would you do it the way he did? Also not bad for choosing the worst possible way to get off that hill.
Driving in Bollington has never been easy.
Good job. Your repair bill will be $5000.
Still a better driver than Mazepin
I couldn't stop laughing. I loved the checking the side mirrors. 😂
Why are there cars just blocking the road?
Guy: Bye mum! Mom: OK, reverse safely. Guy: What reverse? Bye mum!
In-fugging-credible 😄
Why not back down? LOL
Is it possible the cars ecu malfunctioned -  somehow would not give him reverse or neutral
How convenient to have someone there to smoothly film it.  I'm thinking this man has done it before.
Whyyyyyyyyyyyy? He couldn't reverse? He couldn't even just take his foot off the gas and roll back? He couldn't go up any further and turn around in a better spot? WHYYYYYY?
Honda needs to bring back the Crosstour, because that was impressive.
The anxiety this filled me with lol
I heard that the Sheila holding the camera got the car stuck and the legend behind the wheel saved the day.
This has to be the results of a bet with a large amount of money involved. Right? Why else would such a person make such a decision and have it filmed? 1. It's being filmed from the start 2. The driver is skilled and knows where reverse is 3. That is a narrow, mountain top driveway. i.e. a rich person's home
Instead of just putting it in reverse and backing down , you're  real bright you are
It looks like this man might have made this 500-point turn before 😂
As I've gotten older, I've learned it's not fair to make fun of people for doing ridiculous things when they have the ability to also get themselves out of it
probably this is why hella said  you don't know what's possible  princess to thor  🤣🤣🤣 IN MOVIE
Never thought I'd see a front dig with a two wheel drive vehicle. 😀 (1:40)
All in a knock off Honda.
😂
Has to be a hire car 😂
insane.... is a word in the dictionary
He certainly was committed to this daffy endeavor.   He even went to the trouble of chipping away at the rocks on the side of the hill so he would have just enough room to turn around.
Like everyone else, I'm both disgusted and impressed at the same time.
That’s some Asian level driving mixed with Asian level difficulty mixed with Asian level precision.
POV - When Cerebrum Stops Functioning
Hey  Ozzie Man, I think the term you're looking for is "cock up cascade"
As an Asian, I can confirm, our driving may suck but we will math our way out of it.
It's called "backing up." Learn it. Live it.
I've had 50 heart attacks
I know he's joking but the guy most probably has adjustable mirrors and is using them to see what's happening around his wheels
Impressive, yet unnecessary. Best way to describe this situation.
ah the Austin Powers Turn Gambit... unorthodox yet effective
Those are some hideous wheels
It would’ve been more impressive it was a manual transmission 😂
This is a new commercial for Honda?
Why??
Huuuummm just backup maybe???!!!
1/10 for the original reverse 10/10 for commitment. The poor left front tyre is fucked though.... theory is this a hire car?
To be fair what he did is kinda impressive lol
I feel like this was done on purpose for the sole focus of getting views on a video. Cuz why is some guy randomly filming this? Say what you will, but the precise execution of making that kind of turn could not be done by anyone who wasn’t smart enough to simply reverse down the hill. I would not say this is a bad driver. A bad driver would NOT have been able to do what he just did. Buuut maybe I’m wrong and that guy is one lucky SOB.
Those front tires have got to be more bald than I am after making that turn.
Holy shit dude...  😑
I feel like this is set up lol
Whyyyyyyyyyyyy?
God this video is horrible to watch 😂. Love it!
This is prime example of humans over complifying things that could be simple.
I would have just reversed down the hill, but that’s just me. Props to this guy’s patience and ability to survive.
Great honda commercial
Bruh can't back up in the first place to have fell off, I would've backed straight down no issues. >< But he did frigging great not falling off for good. Patience is a virtue.
Obviously bro bet him a 10er he couldn't 3 point turn on the side of a wall...10er up m8
This is the same person answering your customer service calls. Remember that.
Why didn't he just back out... I wonder what it says on the used car market
I thought this was a mislabeled Desitnation F#*ked video...
Wow wow wow
The back passenger side wheel was locked up as he pulled away.
Well if he would just stop squinting then he might have been able to use his mirrors to back down that
He had no fucking right pulling that off.
they said it couldn't be done. He said "hold my beer"
Free Honda commercial.
A very skilled driver who's going to make quite a bit of money from this video.
Bampton every day !
Hint: Do not buy a car with license plate "B TG839"
The poor sills ..... 😢
I think he had try to reverse to the bottom but it was so steep that is rear bumper was catching the bottom of the ramp and there must of been a blockage on the road going up that why he did that all i can think of poor car
Here's what happened. His buddy was tired of hearing about his parallel parking and tight space driving skills so the friend said "$20 says you can't turn around in old man Lees driveway."
drugs. i am betting on drugs
I have no words.... but "how"
He is not going to have a poo for a week puckered so tight.
It's amazing how far stupidity mixed with stubbornness can get you when you put your mind to it.
why in da fuck didnt he just reverse?!  Ozzy man wouldnt have given us a good laugh if he didnt!
Surprisingly impressive considering the same brain that got him into that mess got him out in a very calm and calculated way 😄
You know what? I’m gonna say. Asian drivers.
That was the most painful to watch thing ever presented on this YouTube channel
Try doing this in a keep and I’m not sure you could. This car is impressive
Imagine what this guy can do with a 4x4 raptor...
Aaallllrighty then.
I've often wondered "What if I get my balls caught in my transmission and can't shift into reverse to back down a driveway anymore?" Now I know.
*TO EVERYONE SAYING "WHY DIDNT HE REVERSE"* Having driven on roads like this a LOT, Im pretty sure he wants to turn around - but doing the 96-point turn on there means certain death if you get it wrong. NEVER drive on a soft dirt edge next to a drop...!!! Or maybe he is just scared of doing it near that drop?  He will have been hoping to do it in the double-wide part - but there is high curb if you look at 3:13
I was taught how to maneuver, but not drive in reverse...
Is he making an ad for that car model?! 🤔
i got into this mess head on, ill get out of it head on! Brilliance disguised in the inability to back up.
This isn't a first for him. Those tires were destroyed long before this
China or Taiwan?
no one knows but why he didn't backed up ? may be he is not aware that there is reverse gear BUT one thing is for sure and everyone should reckon that this indeed was a bet game between homies for sure , who the hell wanna do that under any normal circumstances and cameraman silently video taping - they KNOW what they were trying to accomplish
For a full 60 seconds, I kept repeating "What are you doing?". But then I started to see where he was going with this and was glad to see he made it. Of course, it was the completely bonkers and wrong way to go down the ramp when he could have backed up instead but hey, it's obvious which one was cooler.
It's a road that would send him to Destination Fucked, but he caught himself and managed to get the hell outta there before it was too late. 10 out of 10.
The car has reverse so why didn't he just bac down the hill? DWA!
I cannot come up with one reason why he turned around. I would have backed up all the way down.
Unbelievable!! Id've put down a hundo sayme he'd never make it outta there but holy rock candy mountain he did it. It ain't about what happens but how you handle yourself when it does.
Dude was happy to reverse up to and even drop a tyre off of a sheer drop, using only his mirrors to make the judgement. At one point, he dropped both back tyres off the edge and spun the car on itself with some wheelspins from the fronts. So given that he's happy to spin the car on it's belly, reverse up to a sheer drop and let the engine scream a bit, probably burn the clutch a little bit, it's absolutely bewildering that he didn't reverse down the ramp. I'd love to know what his reasons were...
I don't know what was more crazy. The fact that the driver thought this was possible, or the fact that they actually did it.
How to drive without common-sense.  Just back down the hill, your nearly at the approach!
Respect for the honda, good luck doing that in any other car.
someone probably bet him he couldn't turn it around
This is why you can't buy used cars anymore...
quiet carefully, almost silent carefully
Just reverse the damn car
"I know how to reverse but only for a distance of less than half a meter or so"
Put it in reverse Terry! Wha wha wha, what you doin Terry?!
This is the most lazy content I’ve ever seen
you like cars you need collab with garbage time dankpods
There goes the smart Asian thing.
Did he just beat a boss level of fuck around & find out?! Wtf.
Clearly one of those cars with no reverse gear 🤷‍♂️
Just reverse!
The Honda car is FWD .. front wheel drive. So rear wheels can hang in air no issues.
This was almost exactly like that scene from Austin Powers where he tried to do U turn in that narrow hallway
I will never understand how some people manage to make a living when they demonstrate so clearly they have zero ability to think.
Why not just reverse down?
INSANE that he pulled it off, but that car is screwed
I’m not sure if this is good driving or bad driving?
All I can say is SHIT FIRE,  Honda makes a damn fine 4 X 4 and not even on purpose! ...Just sayin'!
Damn!!!
Life is a joke in hell
That feeling when you're watching someone do something you can finish in 5 seconds.
Not doing his particular racial stereotype any favors here...
The part you didn’t see was his girlfriend got the car in this position, he got it out, another example of men superior at driving 😂
Great advertisement for that car model 😅
Car abuse happens everyday. Even an ugly car like that deserves a better owner 😄
Commercial for Honda all wheel drive?
Why not just reverse down & why did someone film it?? 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
I really wonder why he did not just back up........
Another AI generated video?
I cannot believe he fucking pulled that off.
😲
Well that's not something you want to see every day. 😳😅
Why not just back down? I’m so confused
Trevor Rainbolt can tell you exactly where this guy is! 😏
Clearly a video on how to wall ride, this guys parkour and skate videos are great! And since he's got his drivers license he's adapting his art. But its a bit of back to basics until he gets the hang of it.
But why didn't he just go backwards ?
So… don’t buy used cars from that part of the world lol got it 👍🏻
What am i watching
Wow...at the end of that you just have to be impressed.
This person can easily reverse down. I suspect it was a bet or just to prove his skills.
When you adjust the rear view mirrors downward to see the ground by your tires, they are very handy when parking.
Honda. Bulletproof. Now in dumb-proof trim too
this guy risked his whole life to avoid reversing 🫣
The dude a legend, the car scarred for life 😅😂
This is obviously planned…
What we don't realize this is just part of his regular morning commute 😅
Must've been a dare!
Is this in GTA?! If not, it should be.
Pretty common thing to see in China. It really is a different world.
Stereotype exists for a reason! He is it!
Im a little shocked he looked at his mirrors so much. If he knew how to use them maybe he could have used those mirrors just to back the fuck up LOL
You just know he hit's that corner on the way back on the the road, at the bottom of the hill. Past the difficult bit, is the lazy bit.  Lol.
Just discovered my new role model. What a legend.
Who needs a reverse gear when you got an oil pan, sideskirts, rims, an exhaust system and bumpers to tank the damage
Thats definitely DWA
For sure someone else got the car stuck and he rescued them
Must have been a bet of some kind, no sane person would otherwise do this...
This was extremely educational, should I ever find myself in a similar situation I now know not to give up.
The amount of comments that are saying "why didn't he just reverse" I guess they missed why this video is what it is....and how impressive it actually is lol
When you don't know how to back up........
This proves it. Idiots have plot armor.
That I fucking impressive
One of those cars that has no reverse gear
Honda Acord Cross Tour
Bottom of the car is bashed and scraped to hell
Just move somewhere else wtf
Gives male drivers a bad name.
So this is the valet parking from that 5-star restaurant up the hill? I can actually hear chef Ramsay yelling at this guy.
Lol a good driver would have just backed all the way out
Nightmare fuel
The beauty of AWD
I gotta say, regardless of why, that was pretty damn impressive
🚘❤Great manovers
Drunk driving …..woke up in morning like …WTF?…. Dude is stubborn and wants to make it home in time for a latte cappuccino before his tango lesson and starts the 45 point turn around….. 🤷‍♂️…?…CHOW 🚘
I can't help being judgey judgey. This guy needs to practice driving in reverse.
In *_tire_* pretation 😆
It was like watching Neo in the Matrix, I could reverse the car, but there is no spoon
Some people are just addicted to making their lives miserable on purpose.
Good AWD add for Honda Corp.
Terrible idea, brilliant execution. Quite a rare combination in these videos.  It was completely predictable that he was going to get into difficulties once he was square to the road because both rear wheels were going to go off the edge, but I didn't predict that he would actually get out of it. I'm still not sure how he went from spinning the front wheels to actually getting the rear wheels back on the road. Sheer determination seemed to beat physics, which is very impressive.
Why didn't he just reverse all the way
I'm thinking that a guy like this would have reversed all the way down. Maybe he was helping someone else that fucked up 😅
Look carefully at the damage to the base of the stone at the lower left, at the damage done to said stone. It looks quite obviously as though some protrusions were removed with some sort of tool. (Hammer? Pickaxe? Who knows?)   But my guess is this thing was a complete and total, purposeful set up to show off skills. Which would explain the lack of simply reversing.   Impressive skills? Yes.  Still most probably a completely set up situation? I'm betting yes for that too.
Lmao tyre language
Why wouldn't he turn left and reverse?
Done on purpose. Just back down. All wheel drive car.
I gotta say, at the beginning, I was Judgy McJudgypants and now I have to admit this guy is a frickin' genius.
I'm  torn between laughing at an idiot and applauding a man with far better driving skills than me. I can't  decide  if he knows what he is doing and is highly  skilled, or a very lucky idiot.
I’d like to follow this guy around and see how he solves other simple problems.
you could do this! or just reverse back
Impressive, Bet that car has a backup camera.
Dude is lucky that car has front wheel drive
I'll be the prick...I'm annoyed as f**k he got out of this situation that way, but I have to give him credit for the patience and the win.  But seriously, WTF?!?!
Even Ozzy man uses plural pronouns for individuals?
Why did I watch start to finish?
Honda should put this in a commercial. 😅
I did a turn around like that on a mountain top trail on the side of a cliff in a 1986 Toyota Back to the future edition, manual trans,  and about 6 buddies in the bed and cab.    They all jumped out and left me inside the truck alone.  To show my appreciation For my friends and my spotter ditching me out of fear, i made them all walk back down.  You wanna know how awesome i felt after making it in spite of what everyone said?   It was REAL good.
A real man never uses the reverse gear !
No regets
Was i the only one hope the car fell at the beginning
Damn it. He had to be asian..
About how he got there, There is a girl holding the camera.
Fark that, I was thinking, maybe the only explanation of not reversing is it won't go into reverse or broken, but then you could just put it in neutral and roll back. Absolute crazy mofo 😂
Genius idiot? Idiot genius? When you risk backing your car off a sheer drop off, but could have just PUT IT IN  REVERSE AND BACKED OUT!
Am I the only one wondering why he didn't just reverse?
Asians 😂
Saw a woman high center on a raised divider. Had a great view from a restaurant. Smoked theories repeatedly. She went waaaaay to long without giving up, was amusing.
honestly, this is freaking dumb. it has nothing to do with skill, everything achieved here was solely possible because of the car and how well it handled the abuse. not to mention the damage done to the vehicle with that maneuver
I'm disgusted yet thoroughly impressed at the same time 😅
Is that Hammond?
was Austin powers driving?
First minute and a half you're like.. "this idiot.. wtf is he doing.." and the last two minutes you're like.. "alright.. not bad.. not bad at all.. very impressive". xD
Thank goodness for the Mute button
But why!?!
Brilliant
As a tow truck driver i recommend this technique. It always works and is super cool. If it fails ill help you out for like 700 bucks.
So, the two cars on the road were either:  (a) Intrigued/captivated by what was going on  (b) Both broke down  (c) Part of some spectator sport that only the three of them are involved with and placing bets  (d) Having a conversation about the Yankees  (e) A, B, and D and our main character was saying   "(f) You, I have places to be and I'm pretty sure I know a shortcut"  (g) zus Christmas it's somehow all of the above.
This person lost a bet and/or needed social media/Youtube content.
If this is you standard for good driving I hope they take away your driver's license Ozzy.
This was all anxiety and morbid curiosity
Tragically his life was taken minutes later by a teenager doing a burnout in their parents Mustang
I never thought it possible that the driver would manage to turn the car around, despite the stuidity, incredible.
I'm just stunned he didn't high center the car. I would have never believed this was possible!
Chinese advert for brakes.
He did this to show it could be done, not because he needed to turn around. Maybe as a bet?
Sitting here judging him w this smug look on my face.... Look of wonder and amazement creeping in, held in place only by my lingering doubt... The moment of acceptance upon realizing my own hubris lifted by the giddiness of spectating human achievement...  Thank you OzzyMan
i have seen his video before
Austin Powers eat your heart out
Build back better in action
Longest, most avoidable k-turn ever
Just crazy
Why in the fuck would anyone ever turn around in this situation?
An ad campaign manager told him they wanted this pro driver to emphasize how tight the turn radius is on their vehicle, bht after stunt driving for too long, this is what he went with. Some other ad wizard will jazz this up and make it look amazing.
i maybe smart enough to just reverse the car, but i won't be able to do what he did in a lifetime.
when you watched too much of those Brother Che tutorials from Tiktok
he did it because he COULD
Wow, he has a driver’s license?
WTAF did I just watch? If you have enough skill to do a 3pt turn there why wouldn't you just back down?  How can I make my life harder today? Hmmm🤔
He does this all the time on different roads.
Anyone know what kind of Honda that was?
As a judgy cat, I'm absolutely impressed and still don't understand why he didn't just reverse or roll back down the hill
I'm impressed with the drive train
He might have gotten out of it, but he also got into it. I don't know what to feel. I'm confused.
tell her she can just reverse
Car for sale, 1 careful owner. Ignore the sills as currently going though a warranty claim for corrosion.
But...he could have just put it in neutral.  I have conflicted feelings here
He had to have done some damage to the bottom of his car. The most ridiculous thing I've ever seen anyone do in an automobile.
Front wheel drive is the hero here
Yea i hate it when me and my tires fall out with one another, dodgy bastards they can leave skid marks in your undeys, as well as the road did you know that?
Careful not to damage the front bumper on the hill there...😳😬😵‍💫
Do they not have reverse in there country. Either that or may be the dumbest person alive. Guinness should reach out to him definitely shouldn't be driving.😂
😂😂😂
That guy is the smartest idiot ive ever seen, he turned a simple job of reversing down the hill into a 50 point turn that almost ended up real bad about 48 times and still drove away with no damage to the car, his underwear may have some damage though.
Why.... why not just drive in reverse?... it’s a small way down..
For people that don't understand -The ramp was very steep and it would be dangerous to back a vehicle all the way down.
Plot twist:  The wheels came off the axles when the vehicle entering the roadway.
If that had of been a rear wheel drive he wouldve been screwed
But can he parallel park?
I lived in Vietnam for several years and my mind blown every day all day long with their driving skills
When you have skills, but no intelligence
Wow, actually really impressive. Maybe Granny or Granddad had an oopsie with the car, and he was being a good grandson
Damn I did not see that coming. WoW great job HONDA.
Its without a doubt staged. He couldve easily backed down and done a 2 point turn. The only fuck up is by other people thinking its real, impressive or making a video about it because you're all giving O.P the desired reaction designed from this amateur stunt which nets income from not really earning it. Once again teaching children its far better off doing stupid shit for a rise than actually earn a living.
Uhm you inly Just had to back up sir🙄
I mean, I'd give up the front and  scrape it off to save the car then back out
Hopefully he did this as a bet.
Task failed successfully.
We saw the good and bad in humanity here.
Quite impressive he didnt grind the chasis, but turning your wheel while stationary is very unhealthy habit all you people should learn NOT to do. Imagine driving a car without powersteering, its nearly impossible to turn while stationary.
"It's not gonna fit." "It'll fit baby, I'm thinking about my grandparents."
Hats off to the power steering pump, the real hero of the day
Whoever's going to fix the panelwork will be confused and have many questions to what vent down (or around)...
I can smell the clutch from here.
Я бы у него машину не купил
Whata 🍆
License plate is from Guizhou, China. It is all mountains like this and the drivers are also... all like this
I’m so fucking confused.
Aaaaaand this is how you can totally mess up your car chassis... gg, man... well played (no)... next time just go down in reverse.
It reminds me of Austin Powers 😂😂
Too logical
An A+ for Effort offset by an F- for Good Judgement; why the hell didn't he just reverse down that incline?   I wonder if afterward he thought of that and mentally kicked himself.  It's  virtually impossible there was no damage to the undercarriage but nevertheless he put the equivalent of 20,000 miles of wear on the front tires; this one situation where AWD would have helped immensely.  If it had been an EV he might have cracked the battery compartment.  That was Greenhorn inexperience shining VERY brightly.
Give him a break, his driving instructor was Austin Powers. Honestly, all the car damage aside, that was actually pretty impressive.
If you cant reverse you cant drive.
Now do it with a trailer attached.
It's pretty normal for China.
He must've been proving a point to his wife.
That he chose THAT method to get out also reveals how he got  there in the first place.
Now I'm thinking I should buy a Honda.
Confused or impressed i am not sure my brain is like yeah nah yeah nah.
Whatever the reason for not just reversing straight back, I suspect there's some form of dumbassery behind it
How to scrape up your car's underside real good instead of just reversing straight down
Stupid is forever!
Buddy: “100 bucks says you can’t flip a B” Giga Chad: “Oh you’re ON!”         …witchcraft Buddy: “…well shit”
Anyone who can’t reverse a car needs their license revoked. I don’t care how impressive that 100% unnecessary pivot was.
Plot twist: It's his own driveway.
So when he got to the road and two cars were blocking the way up the hill did he have to turn around again?
That was simultaneously the best and worst driving I've ever seen
The Crosstour was a car ahead of its time.
I cannot handle this 😂 This is why I keep my circle small so I’m less likely to have to deal with things like this
.....and exhale!
So, kudos for making it, but like Ozzy said, it would have taken less time to back up (and likely less damage).
I don't think I relate to humanity anymore. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL IS HE DOING
Classic example of :Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
Reverse??
I guess the Darwin awards committee will have to wait for another day to hand this guy a trophy
Man turning around in your driveway is a pain in the ass
Why?
I know backing up can be dangerous... But this is as inexcusable as it is patiently skilled.
Um reverse?
Wow the cameraman was so useful. Sure I can put some weight on the front to make your tire catch. Ya you have clearance at the front to make the turn now.
my IQ dropped 80 points watching this
Yeah!!! Baby...
.....ok
This definitely seems like a, "I bet I could turn around in your driveway" situation.  I noticed some of the rock by the front of the car has recently been chipped away.
😳
Lets not judge... maybe the reverse would've been too easy... wanted the challenge... fair play to them...  Stunning turn...
Pretty impressive. Let's see one of Elon's self driving Tesla monstrosities do that. They can't, can they? No, they cannot.
He definitely did that for a bet 🤣
It’s a fairly serious mental defect that you choose turning round over reversing in this case… 😅
Why doesn’t he just back up
why would he not reverse to the main road first?
guys just recreating that sketch from Austin Powers.
I watched him do it, but im still convinced it's impossible. I can't work out what i just watched.
This man deserves an ice-cold beer and a pat on the back (as does Ozzyman).
Why??? Why turn there? There is a wider road 3 meters away.
Who would have thought....
this... this one hurt a little.....   ffs mate..
Just...just reverse?? Do you think he knows how to reverse?
F it i did this on GTA 5 man ....easy .
Mercedes is kicking themselves now. Lol.
Hey buddy 👊 I remember seeing this video 2-3yrs ago... and seeing it again, still makes me smile 😁 Obviously, prevention is better than cure, but since he got in that position and then got out of it, fair play 💪 For me, I think it was 'staged'... if a driver ever got in that position, most would panick & freeze, abandon the car, or call for help. However, he kept calm, clearly a reasonably skilled driver, which begs the question of how he got in that situation in the first place, unless it was deliberate...  Social media does funny things to some 😉 Cool channel, thanks for sharing, Atb Gus 👍
Pretty confident and impressive👏🏽. Think it will be easy to slowly back away in reverse
Now try that with friggin truck ya clever bastard
I think someone should buy this guy a midstrength beer 🍺
And at the bottom he made another uturn 😂
Gee-zus! it looked impossible...
Patience of a saint
He took the phrase “never look back” a bit too seriously.
Bro seriously couldn’t just reverse straight back? 🤦‍♂️
As someone who's Forklift certified. I do not approve this
RIP to the underside of that car  💀
Stop talking
The best example of military interviews where one wonders why he was thrown out despite having the greatest skills.
To the mechanics, what damage may this cause?
Why didn’t he just drive in reverse down the hill?
I feel like this was a drunken bet with the person filming.  "Mate, I'll bet you can't exit the driveway going forward" "Pfft, hold my baijiu"
At first i said this idiot, then saw his driving ability and said who drives this well, with no panic and ends up in that situation.  If i had to guess someone else got the car stuck and he was called in to save it.  Based on the cars blocking the road it probably started impacting the area and the guy who can drive got called
Get Rainbolt to find the location. We need to see what was at the top of this hill!
Austin powers vibes for sure
500 point turn, that’s a pass.
Why tf did Honda built a car without reverse gear?
Reverse doesn't work on that car damn Chinese, Korean & Indian cars
Anxiety level 💯
Personally, I would have just backed down the hill. But I know how to back up.
Jeepers...
You didn't even need to select reverse. Just let your foot off the brake and roll back down. It must have been done specifically for the video.
What actually were the 2 cars on the road doing??
His bro with the camera was like “bet you turn this pile around up here” and he’s like “hold my beer”
One more piece of evidence to prove that remarkably stupid people are protected by epic luck!! 🤣
All they had to was reverse
Bob there on the narrow hill path clearly never learned how to drive backwards, JFC...
Hopefully he lost in a Fantasy Football league. They made him stop right at that spot and said, “now you have to turn around and go down this hill fwd.”
Probably scraped the shit out of the fuel tank and exhaust.
Quick question, why didn't he just reverse?
Driving like an Asian is a worldwide phenomenon ❤
Work harder, not smarter.
Why is that person trying to do a 1000 point turn? Just back up  lol
The dude is purposefully showing impressive turn arounds. Getting out of the situation was never the only goal. The goal is to turn a car around in a crazy situation. So stop asking why he did t just back out.
That's not "good driving", that's just being to stupid to drive backwards. 🤦‍♂
Wtf next time just drive backwards
If that's not destination fawkked I duno what is 😂😂  Cheers
This is one of those.... "It doesn't matter, they got out of the problem"
The only logical explanation is that his mates bet him $100 he couldn't turn around on that road.
A good driver wouldn't be an idiot like that to begin with!!!
Ozzy Man knows "Car-munication"
exactly...why not just reverse??
How the hell was this worth doing
As long as you have 3 points of contact you're good, thought that was just for climbing not turning a car
This is NO accident. I've seen that guy before. He does this stunt on the regular for clicks. Even if his skills are awesome, he has MASSIVE balls for even attempting this U-Turn, let alone practising till he mastered it. That said, it's a stupid thing to do in the first place.
wait holy shit i wasnt expecting that
How do you blind a China... never mind. We see how in this video.
Does he not realise that car has a reverse gear?
Not at all how I expected that to go
Why didn’t he just reverse down the hill …..
They live among us.
That car has to have a backup camera. Even if it doesn't, I'm absolutely mind blown.
You can just reverse !
I dread to think how many times this man has done this "unsuccessfully" haha. Practice makes perfect!
They weren't waiting to pass. They were hoping he'd fall.
Just reverse 😂
I would guess it was a dare or he is just showing off his insane driving skills. At first I genuinely thought what he was trying was impossible.
The man obviously has masterful control over his car. He knows he could have easily reversed all the way down to the main road. What we see is a staged stunt performed for our entertainment and it takes advantage of the fact, that the beginning suggests that we see an unskilled driver who makes a terrible mistake.
Not impressed if all u did was drive off after the turn around. Why didn't he just back up
Honestly, that was f**kin impressive!
Moral of the story learn to reverse kids
Just when you thought you had bad OCD.....
Wow
Incredible, This is the template hollywood needs for making spectacular movies.
😁😁😁👍👍👍
Why?
That was very Asian.
Maybe thats what he goes to work like every day.
Destination PERFECT!? 😮😮😮
☠️
Here's a perfect example of a person make his own life more difficult.  All you had to do was go in reverse. Would've wasted less time, and not cause damage to the vehicle.
oh so that's why we have front wheel driving
The cameraman probably bet him he couldn't do it.
I did not expect for this clip to get a proper resolution, still less that he would actually manage to turn the car there, impressive.
Wat is he doin, go forward.
Impressive sincerely.  When the drug cartel says, turn around…you bloody well turn around,lol
I'm gutted I was waiting for the car to become scrap 😂😂😂 great that he managed to get back down in one piece
I never thought I'd see the Austin Powers U-Turn scene in real life.
What the actual Austin Powers was that shit?
His other hobbies include wall papering hallways thru letter boxes
That's the power of front wheel drive, right there.
He destroyed his car nevertheless...
"To do well what should not be done."  Gore Vidal said that about T.V., but I think it applies here.
Too stressful for this time Ozzyman , too stressful, I skipped to the end
That's the level of patience we should all aspire to.
Three minutes of anxiety.  Also, who filmed this?
If he simply reversed, he would never have ended up on Ozzy.. Well played sir.
It's easy to hate, but I couldn't do that. That was precise as hell.
Why—WHY—not just reverse down the hill?
He could have literally reversed off 😂😂 instead he chose to pull an Austin powers
Austin powers could learn a thing or two from that bloke
Reverse gear? What's that?
This reminded me of Skyrim horses
This looks more like one of those ads of insanity turning for a car model or driving team or something - seen a few of those before!   Better choreography than most tho.  :D
Serious Austin Powers vibes lmao
Why!?!
Imagine doing this in a manual
Could have just put the transmission on reverse and then back up.
It seems he did it on purpose, because he knows how people are like and he wanted to be remembered for a long time.
His car will never trust him again.
I don't believe that was a great show of skill cuz the skill driver would have just back down the road. I would say that was a good show of patience. Yeah
That happens when you learn to live with your backwardsparanoia.
Had my fair share of WHAT moments in China- plenty of Chinese uncles and aunties who just kept on going and did turns moves etc. Good to see this hehe
A true Dark Souls enthusiast
Gotta say, I'm pretty impressed with the strength of that clutch and torque output 😮 Pretty sure this was a deliberate thing they were doing (at least I REALLY hope so) but damn 😅
Maybe a market stunt. Hire a pro driver to show what your car can do in a viral video.
That is not at all how i expected that video to go 😂
Good grief 🤦‍♂️
Says more about Honda than the lunatic driving....
I have so many questions
for those who are wondering why this bloke didn't just reverse?             🎤 guess we'll never know
bad idea? he does this with every car he can.
Should be an add for Honda Motor Co. Asia on how capable their cars is! Ha!
The car can clearly reverse. So... why?!?
Why not just back down and why didn’t the camera person guide him???
The problem here with this is that he didn’t fall off the edge
Probably didn't do his tyres any favours with all that dry steering.
Why why why why why didn't he just back up?!
Now do it with rear wheel drive.
We share the roads with these people.....let that sink in. 😁
Mainland Asians tired of the media treating Asian drivers in the west is the same in the east🤣🤣🤣
Perfect example of how thoughtless most people are today. He could have simply backed all of the way down, it wasn't very far, but no, he decided to risk his life was his only option.🙄
JESUS! Put it in reverse
Common sense left the chat.
He did not give up. He has the austinpower to make to most out of this situation.
I agree with the reverse back, but DAM that was good driving 😂
REVERSE?!
Judging from the number plates, this guy is from Guizhou Province (in China).
Why not just back out why turn around?
why did he no reverse lolol😅😅😅😅😅
I cant believe he pulled that off. I also cant believe he tried to pull it off.
"I reckon he could've reversed all the way, could've been easier."  Do you really?
That Hinda is  dope
Very impressive 33 point turn
Wtf
Major Austin Powers moment for this guy...
That went much better than I anticipated.
this was a how to turn round demo video for mountain roads that are narrower than your car
Quality
If i had a car that looked this shit i wouldn't give a flying fuck about it either...
That's a win for Honda!
Oh, off Roading in a variety of calls over decades, and I’ve never had in self a situation like that even in mud and snow.
that is the real driver 👍
„I‘m a city wheel!“ 😂
That's monumental stupidity combined with extreme skill, and I still can't believe what I just saw!
Lol guy was the best driver ever.
😂❤
That was impressive. Clearly a rental
WOW
This man needs a scooter
I don’t have any words to say 🤯
I love your videos, but you’re getting lazy lately
Honda Crosstour, possibly all wheel drive but it doesn't have the badge on the back denoting "4WD" like my American version. Also I can't tell if it has a backup camera like mine which would make it more logical to just back up, lol.
I love how people not realize they fell for rage bait
0:45 why didn't he just reverse?
Reversing all the way down doesn't make for near the views this video got.
ANY IDIOT CAN GET INTO TROUBLE...Takes a legend to get out of it!
No need to reverse. I will simply do an eleventybillion point turn here
"Would you like the additional damage protection on your rental today?"  "You know what? I won't need it."
So you're hanging off the edge and worried about pulling up too far and scratching your front bumper. 🤦‍♂️   I can't imagine being so scared of backing down the road that you're willing to risk your life doing a 90 point turn. I'm always amazed how many poor drivers there are.
I guess he missed the class that teaches you that R means reverse.
I have said it before and I will say it over and over and over again, some people should not have licenses, most of them should not be allowed anywhere near a vehicle of any kind, even as passengers!!!!!!!!!
He's SO BAD at reversing.
I didn’t go far down on comments but didn’t see or believe anyone said “HOW STUPID HE WAS NOT backing down?” Common sense much! He’s quite lucky he didn’t take a dive! I still call him a dummy even though he made it.
Why not just reverse? I mean, we know that the bloody reverse gear works.
Yeanahyeanahyeanah isn't that the same guy that did that during a rally race? I remember him driving a car with logos on it on that same road.
Destination clutch f-ed
I'd just like to add he didn't even scratch the paint. That's pure control and magic 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and the voiceover is perfect! Thanks for my first laugh of the day and i'll make sure to check my mirrors.
Honda for the win.
I’d bet in his day job he’s a cab driver in Taiwan. Those people know the dimensions and capabilities of their vehicles! 😅
Why not just reverse down the ramp?
When driving in reverse is just too damn hard...
Wow, this driver is Mr. Stupide
I honestly don't know if this is impressive or disturbing 😂
The word quite exists.
WTF?!? You gotta give the guy some kudos, though. Despite not being very smart, he actually managed to make a turn there. Holy crap.
Staged
Can't tell if I should be horrified or impressed. Horripressed? Imprefied?
What about just revering it back instead of a 300 point turn!! Thick as shite.... lol
Why didn’t he just Reverse out wtf 😂😂
I’m thinking about what the underneath of this car looks like now😂
Or, Or, Or... Maybe just Back back down?
Who was filming this?  And were they disappointed by the result?
bet you a 1000 bucks i can turn my car on the narrow road
F"ck knows how he's going to carry on up that road though cos the roads blocked by the 3 cars behind him.
Astonishing , kudos for the 37 point turn
i don't know ... he's ables to reverse the gear ...
Or, now stay with me.... you could just back up.
Did he have to be Asian?
I don't get why that guy needed to turn around i would of reversed down and turned using the junction at the bottom
fcking Legend!
The simplest solution is to let someone else drive.
Strangest place I've ever seen   for someone to pull off an illegal U-turn 😅
Is this where they got the golf cart scene from Austin Powers? 1:30
Impressive he managed to turn around, but I'd love to see the undercarriage on that thing. No way that there wasn't any damage done. If I did that in my car there'd be a dump pipe left sitting on the driveway and a very confused driver trying to understand why the car is suddenly so much noisier.
To much Austin Powers for that guy.
Skyllz
He's definitely doing it to show off the driving skills, there are even two cars to block the road in the background
Who was filming and why didn’t they say anything? I call bullshit. Olim Omega would have fun with it.
It's impressive until u realize that he could have just put it in reverse an been go an hour ago 😅
When the gps nav tells you to make a u-turn
This guy's so successful that he never looks back... Even his car doesn't have a reverse gear...
Try that with a self driving car.
But why?
Impressive skill. But I am just a simple man and I would use the forgotten skill of reversing.
I don't know if I should be impressed or Speak the language of the Great Red Forman on this one...yea!
I refuse to believe this
Nicely done, but just a display of power. He could back done in reverse.
Amazing that the car could handle that
That dude clanks when he walks.
For someone who obviously doesn't like reversing they did a lot of reversing! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He’s done himself a mischief
For sale: Red Honda. Low miles.
HONDA... das auto
Holy Batman like a boss!🫢
Even if the reverse gear is missing he could've just but it on neutral and let it roll down
all who asks what's the use of stick drive and prefer automatic drive¿¿ here is a perfect example how a manual drive is the best car
🤦‍♂🤔🤷‍♂
With the power of dreams
Only we do know….it’s an alleged show of skill……if you call being a wanker a skill that is. Chinese fad…..
Who else was moving forwards and backwards as if that could help him?
I guess the person filming this could have provided some sane advice - but that would have ruined the video.
Maybe marijuana shouldn’t be legal.
I'm going to refer to the "yeah nah nah yeah nah nah nah yeah nah yeah" as Aussie yodelling from now on.
Here in the UK it is an offence to reverse into a main road from a side street or driveway.  Stay legal and stay safe!
Single greatest bit of driving I've ever seen
He must be a government minister.
In the world of inane decision makers that driver is king.
....why the hell didnt he reverse out of there.   But seriously impressed with his sensible feet turning on the ramp would not have been my first choice.. ...still impressive.  One word to my representation in the european parliament.  NEVER GIVE ANY CHINESE IMMIGRANT A DRIVERS LICENSE  without retesting them on european standards. (same for yankees)  cheers with beers from finland
If its a stupid idea, but it works...its not stupid. That was an impressive bit of driving
May it was a rental car and he does not care.
A testament to the third world, where you don’t have to learn driving to get your driving licence
I swear..this is a troll and he is a drift king in real life.
OR all he had to do was reverse back
Obviously hes done this before
I cannot fathom the combination of circumstances that led to a driver this skilled, getting into this situation in the first place, but not being able to reverse back down. What is going on here.
if the useless machine was a car with this driver
Jeeeeez!
Everybody thought the same thing.
The Stereotype Department, really got that one correct.
Jesus... what was the camera man thinking?
u w0t fam???
He was just showing off his skills, he could've easily reversed if he wanted
I guess this legend decided to take the road less travelled to a whole new level.
Call me a bad person, but I wanted it to get worse.
I've seen a very similar video to this years ago and i can tell you that this was all done deliberately, this is from China and that is what this person is know for doing just for the fun of it.
He would have been in real trouble if not for those side mirrors
I only give him a 3 out of 4. Coz he was only using 3 wheels alot of the time......
I reckon he could have made it all the way up with a handbrake turn at the top no bother.
What an absolute W⚓️!! Why not just reverse?
he did it because he knew he could! fck the haters
This little maneuver will devalue your car by 50%  and you'll pay the other 50% in repairs
Plot twist - he's perfectly capable of reversing but he just wanted to show off to get on Ozzy man
Reverse gear?? 🤦‍♂️🇬🇧
if youd asked me at the start of the video I would have said its absolutely 100% impossible to turn round on that ramp. I have no idea why it was necessary when reverse is a thing but wow.
As a white man, I believe that only an Asian could’ve possibly pulled this off
Remember when ozzy man was funny?    Those were the days
I would just buy a new car
all of that because he was going back home because he thinks he forgot his car keys.
Well done, shame it now need a new, very expensive clutch!
How?.....how can he do that, but not be able to reverse?
Impressive fucking impressive 😳👍
This has to have been some sort of bet.
This brings back memories.
While he managed to get out of the mess he was in I do wonder how much damage he did to the underside of his car. Probably a lot. That would have been better spent on learning how to reverse.
Some people will do anything to avoid reversing
Let's be clear, he is a bad driver that got lucky this time.
Soo bad, but so talented in equal parts.. sounds like this was a bet between drunken mates... " I bet you cant turn around on the drive way.. " "Hold my beer"
3:09 that's what I was thinking from the beginning...!!!  Just go to reverse!!!!
why didnt he just reverse down?
yeah nah why would you want to reverse back down
He don’t want see back his life by reverse gear😂😂😂
If I would've bet the devil for my soul that he was backing off that hill the would've been up right now
I've seen a couple of these videos. I AM impressed, but why not just back up?
Respekt 😅
Amazing to think that the only thing keeping that car from toppling off the edge was the weight of that man's massive balls in the passenger seat.
Yeah, nah yeah, good effort 🤣
I was hoping he would go over the edge 🎉
It wouldve taken less time just parking next to those other cars and walking uphill.
I swear I've had this as a nightmare.
Okay I'm a grown man so im not scared to say I WAS WRONG and he proved me wrong...
Is he defying the laws of gravity
I have to admit, I was kind of looking forward to the "alternate ending" version of this video....
Has anyone else noticed ozzie man always says quiet instead of quite ?
Off road all wheel drive practice. Total idiot but very impressive.
W...T...F...?
The only scenario where I would prefer FWD over RWD.😅
I don't know how he got there, I don't know why he didn't use traction to go up front and simply reverse, but hats off to him for accomplishing that maneuver.
The best thing my parents did was give me a Ford Excursion to learn how to drive in. Everything else has been significantly easier to park and maneuver in.
So this is the traditional way to u turn a car in China, very interesting!
Destination Fucked or Destination Perfect.  Bit of column A, bit of column B.
How not to drive smart maybe 😂
I thought there was no way he could turn around wow
Backing down the hill would've been sooo much easier.
A simple 3 letter word from me.... WOW!
Looks like Southern China
Got the skills to do a multi-point turn, but not the skills to reverse down a driveway.
By minute 2:40 I was starting to root for the guy like Shia LeBeouf                JUST DO IT!!!
He was going to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant?  This explains so much, this fella was supposed to deliver the lamb sauce!
just demonstrating Honda agility... nbd
that was impressive!!
How to chase clout Women: show cleavage Men:
I'd have lost a lot of money betting against this.
It must have been a bet. Dude just won a big stock of mid-stength beer.
After the recording of this video, every person in this country now looks for damage to the underside of the rocker panel before buying a used car.
I am impressed he managed to turn around. I thought for sure he would have gotten the car stuck and the video would have been someone with like a crane or something just lifting it up and down onto the actual road
I swore that this would not end well. I tip my hat to you sir, well played mate.
I think he was doing that on purpose to show off his skills.
"A bit of a fuck up" might be understatement of the century 😂  But all's well that ends well
Maybe he took over from his wife just before we saw, and she started videoing.
In a fuckin Honda, no less.
This looks like a pro driver in a hold my beer moment.
Why just why?
Would he had scratched the back of his car if he instead reversed back all the way?
Get farked cant believe he pulled it off. But why didnt he reverse 😂😂😂
Fully backing down the hill works to
This car was up for sale 3 days later with the seller desperately hoping no one looks underneath.
Not his first time doing that. 100% sure
_It's important to not judge people on the internet"_ *he said*
Why not just drive backwards and solve it in 3 seconds?
Was dead-set tilting my phone watching this trying to stop the car from falling over!  Was not expecting this kinda immersion from your vids today Ozzy Man😮
WTAF I never thought he'd get it. That was incredible *round of applause*
this physically hurt me
I've never been so conflicted about how to feel about a situation. Absolutly the worst manoeuvre possible to decide to use to get out of that situation. Stupid decision. Then complete disbelief and genuinely impressed that he actually did it 😂.
😮😮😮 I'm impressed 🎉
It some place in China. The same guy takes different vehicles and turns around on that one spot. If you see other videos you'll see that he can turn around at the top. The top of the road isn't far off, it where the camera person is.
😮 how he didn't go tits up I have no idea but we'll done . That was more impressive than a 3 legged goat scaling up a cliff.
The worst thing about that, is the fact he got away with it........
Ozzy man you rock! Never disappointed. Peace
If I was in that car , I would get out walk away
This has to be some sort of promotional video for that honda 4 wheel drive system. I'm genuinely impressed by the driving and capability of the car
He could have just backed down it.
With Aussie Man even the tires have voice 😅
When you're braindead and a genius at the same time.
“Note to self get reverse fixed on the car first thing on Monday”.
Man identifies as a woman driver.
This person completely turns the whole stereotype about Asian drivers being bad drivers on it's head, bravo!
Ok….I stopped this 4 seconds in because I thought Ozzyman was having a “Yananananananana” seizure”.
When you're *really* not happy reversing back out
Don't scratch the front bumper mate!!!
That was the best unnecessary stupid driving I’ve ever seen.
I reckon he works for the council and the locals have been complaining it's impossible to turn on that road 😁
The reverse gear was invented in 1885. People in 1884..
Had my heart in my mouth.
This the most impressive peice of stupidity and genius combined ever
I'm thinking he tried to reverse and got mixed up, THEN decided to do the 50 point turn.
Will it pass its next MOT is the real question
Legend
As dumb as it is to do THAT turn ... as impressed I am he did it😂
This is what is meant when one says   sht for brains.
This was done for views. asians are doing everything for them like building "underground swimming pools "by hand"' "  or rescuing kittens from drowning (after they tossed them in the lake or a  bucket of oil) and other clearly stupid stuff
He did a u-turn because driving forwards is easier than driving backwards duh
"We can be judgy judgy judge judge judgemental all day long and it doesn't get anywhere as a species" - Ozzyman dropping truth bombs before we all get worked up about the guy deciding not to reverse . 😂
The driver now lives in Campsie. Not sure if this is accurate, but if you've ever driven through Campsie, Sydney, you'd know what I mean. 😂
That was TOTALLY impressive. I thought that it was going to be physically impossible.
The definition of overthinking a solution like we know reverse worked 💀😂
Context: He's turning around to clumb up the hill backwards. That's the real mission.
I feel like I've seen this years ago.
That guy had a strong minus signal on his giveafuckometer when it came causing damage to the underside of that car 😂
Can you imagine how he felt at the end? Like a man having a good poo after a fortnight of constipation I should imagine. Oh the relief!
random friend: holly shit dude you gotta change those tires asap! car owner: yeah prob right its already been a month now I shouldnt push it any more.
That point turn was as high as his IQ. I didn't see that achievement as possible.
Im pretty sure that the guy driving in the video wasn't the one who got the car into that situation, he did such an excellent job turning it around. I bet it was the person holding the camera.
Holy shit how the fuck did he make that work  ?!
🤨 it's not like he's going far up the road, as it seems to be blocked just 30m up hill 🤷‍♂
It's funny, when someone does something like this in a truck, nobody questions them. As soon as someone does it on purpose in a car, nobody understands why they are doing it. This is simply a classic case of someone showing off.
How do you even get the idea that here is the place I need to turn around instead of just reversing down the slope?
This is like inventing a nuclear generator to power a lantern so you change the batteries of your torch.
He could have just reversed down all the way.
Asian drivers or women drivers watch out, female Asian drivers, safer to just stay home.
One of my favorite scenes in Austin Powers 😅 after the tent scene 😂
This is me in a rental car lol
Not a scratch
I don’t call this smart driving. Smart driving would be backing down
Fast and the furious Reverse Drift 😌
An incredibly well executed 2000-point turn, but I’d love to know why he didn’t just reverse straight down the ramp
I bet the car was a rental 😂
Why wouldn't you just put it in reverse?
Imagine not knowing what *REVERSE* is
I still don't believe he made that 'work'!
When u drive like shit on purpose to get veiws 😂
Probably a one way street , reversing would left him liable prosecution  ( not being able see where he was going ) I wouldn't have trusted my handbrake
He can say goodbye to his undercarriage.
Cheers from California! Thank you for the video
This is what happens kids when you never learn to reverse. There are consequences.
unnecessary but great
Yeah nah yeah he probably needs a new gearbox if reverse doesn’t work.
I was gonna say...had to be an asian at the wheel...😅 Then I thought had to be an asian at the wheel😱
How does one end up there in the first place??
no amounts of mirrors or onboard cameras can compensate for low IQ
Is he such a cheap driver, that he couldn’t just reverse straight back???
Why, why didn´t he reverse the car????
Well, that was quite the drama. Everything from, "I'm going the wrong way" to, "how do I get out of this situation?" Then a simple, "I'll just hang my Honda's arse over this edge, time and again, being thankful for its front wheel steer and drive the bottomed out  rear end into an Ozzy Man Review and into internet fame".
Difficulty:Asian
TOTALLY BF IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!
Well that's the bottom of that car ruined.
That's more likely a marketing stunt similar to how off roaders go up a hill and splashes through knee deep mud
Little did we know,  the driver taught advanced theoretical parallel parking at a local,  but prestigious university!
I want that honda.  How it managed all that i dont know.
Ok no that was actually impressive, damn 😂😂
Can we all agree that the Honda Crosstour is the star of this show
The question is not how these  people drive. The question is how do all the authorities not see these videos and suspend these people's licenses. Must not be subscribed to Ozzy man.
It was someone else that made the mistake, and he just helped them out!?!
Excellent Honda commercial, the car compensated his intellect and kept him alive through it!
My guess would be that he has done quite a bit of damage to the underside of his car, eg catalytic converter, exhaust, so not very clever.
what the f@ck? why n how?
Asians!
"but i suppose it is important to not fuckin judge people on the internet"
I don't forgive him. This was absolutely 💯 percent unnecessary.
Insurance companies love drivers like this. Craigslist shoppers hate cars like this.
Showoff
Apparently the fastest car in the world is also the most maneuverable. Nothing quite like a rental.
I need to see the end of this hill
Impressive effort in the end, but just use reverse next time
The mirrors are painted on.
The bottom of that car would be completely f**ked up!
90 percent skill 10 percent luck
Even Austin Powers couldn't have done it Better!!🤣
For the majority of those who're wondering why didn't he just reverse the short distance- he's trolling or flexing what he can do with his front wheel drive.  Dumb flex yes, but hey, social media
Stop saying quiet instead of quite.
Sort of a "Nah, yeah" situation.  I saw it and still have trouble accepting it.
Dudes got a phobia of going on reverse for too long apparently lol
Legend has it he’s known as the clutch control master!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reversing was not an option apparently ..  Brain was not braining.
Disappointing ending.  He really should have ended up at destination fucked.
I have so many questions. Why not just reverse, and what are those cars in the background? They're just standing there!
Never say that Chinese don’t know how to drive 😉
I wouldn't buy a used car from this man 🤔
I'm impressed by the no. of comments saying 'reverse'. Brotatoes did you see the level of control the guy had? It's more about doing something because he could lol
stupidly impressive
Grenada, W.I., a lot of roads and driveways look like this, and you need to become one with REVERSE!!
The best part is he had to turn around again at the bottom of the driveway to go down the hill and leave.
Not the smartest move but he managed it 😂
I feel like this driver just wants attention.
And in the next learners exam - "Now please perform a 60 point turn on the slope on your right.”
The car has a reverse gear but driver doesn't
I'm never impressed by stupid people.
How come it's good when taxpayers are forced to fund people whose entire job is judging yet when others of us offer that service for free on the Internet it's a bad thing?
Dude i thought there was no way possible
I blocked countless videos of this crap in recommendations on FB, as if an absolutely pointless waste of time and car abuse suppose to impress anybody. Apparently driving in reverse is illegal in China. Anything for views and likes on social media.
Imagine if his car was rear-wheel-drive!
!
That was the finest 286 point turn I have ever seen.
Asian drivers 😅
Amazing bit of driving
WT actual F
No mater what you can do there is always an Asian thats better.....
Hire cars are the best.
Idiots usually put the wipers on in a tricky situation.
How do some people get licenses?
He’s got some brass ones
It's an emergency braking zone where a truck can role to a stop then use its park brake and gears to cut to a FULL STOP FULL. Because brakes get hot and fail on hills. You are from Perth, so O.M. you wouldn't understand,  because it's as flat as farq there.
I've had nightmares like this.
He could easily go on reverse but where's the fun in that? 😂
That was incredibly anticlimactic and disappointing
That's some Austin Powers level maneuvering right there!
Hey Austin Powers, hold my mid strength beer
The person in the car does these sort of videos for his YT channel it's not some random person making a mistake or doing a stupid maneuver it's for entertainment and now showing on Ozzy mans YT channel 😂
"Now, as the final part of your test, I would like you to pull over and perform a full turn in the road." "Challenge accepted!"
others: why doesnt he just reverse down me: why he drive good?
This is the perfect example of just because you can drive. it doesn't mean you should.
Asian 'driver'.....
This is an add for whatever car it is lol.
My mom be like:    No i mean seriously, she did that in a tight parking terrain instead of reversing 20meters.
I only really drove motorcycles all my life. When I did the driver's license for the car in the US years later I was having problems getting used to the size of the car. During my driver's license test I parked the car and scratched the entire right side of it on a concrete pillar. I still can't park a car right 🤣
My blood circulation reverses watching this video.
What country is that? I would like to know in what country buying a car is so cheap even this person with that driving skill could effort that kind of a car.
Held my breath for 3 minutes
The 'R' on the Gear stick is NOT for 'Race' mode... It's for... R E V E R S E ! ! !    😒😒😒 😎🇬🇧
Holy sweet Jesus 😮
I don't forgive him. He could have reversed the whole way.😒
96 point turn
I've seen clips of this before, but never the whole video. The fact that he steadfastly refused to let the front of his car so much as tap the rock was driving me crazy. If it's a choice between scratching the paint or potentially totalling the car while I'm IN IT, I'm scratching the hell out of it.
But.... Why?
i have to say that i've unsubscribed your channel; no one expecting youtubers to be political, however you've made tonnes of (invadee) ukraine-sided videos, but there is no attention to plaestenians in your channel, they have been butchered for longer time than ukrainans
This is the most qualified Asian driving instructor in the world...if you have to ask how much he charges per lesson, you cannot afford his services...
Just Drive Backwards maybe hahhahahahahah
Can't use mirrors
I sense he did this just to see if he could. That was impressive.
Turns car around, the road is blocked up ahead
Legend status achieved
Ozzy ozzy ozzy... oi oi oi
I went from terrified to flabbergasted to modestly impressed over the course of 3 minutes and 22 seconds.  Edit: Also, definitely RIP (pieces at this point, not just "piece") his undercarriage.
Amazing how deeply one can get into trouble with 4WD
I was 100% certain he was going to get stuck with the 2 back wheels off the cement.   Shows what I know...
😶
Why didn't he just back up?
Never would have imagined that this was possible haha. Still wondering why it was necessary or desirable to begin with, considering how he could've just driven down in reverse, but whatever.   Maybe it's the weirdest ad ever for this car model's four wheel drive ability?
Infinite point turns on a cliff road are part of the Chinese driving test aren't they?
Whenever I get a rental car this is how I imagine the gay before me drove it
This was very impressive and ballsy. 1 wrong move and he would've been stuck in a very different situation. But he did it. I would never even try to do that. I am much more practical.
Honestly, with how fucking stupid it is they didn't just back up and do this dance down below, it's impressive they got 180 without flipping down the hill.
That was.... strangely impressive.
Awesome achievement
Didn't want to try that reverse gear... he's a drive forwards kinda bloke. ;-)
This was obviously staged somehow
Having money is not an indication of intelligence.
He actually succeeded, ..in his peculiar way..0.0
It seemed a bit unnecessary... But in the end he pulled it off. Slap that man left and right in the face and then give him a Beer. Unnecessary but impressive 😮
When you're in Destination Fucked and need the best Uber driver in the area to leave.
How he got into this position in the first place ?
Legend has it, he started going down nose first. But decided to do a complete 360 for the hell of it 😎
Tbf by driving terribly henproved he is a master driver
HOW?!? Just how...
You'd think the guy filming this could have just gone down the driveway and helped him reverse down.
Wow
Why not just use reverse
Right at the start . All they had to do is straiten out and back up down the hill. Why do they find the need to turn around?!?! Just back up???
As a Chrysler Pt Cruiser driver, that's pretty much how we drive.
He REALLY doesn’t like reversing!! 😂
People like this should never pull a trailer
From my calculations a woman started the driving.  And the relief husband was brought in to finish without incident.
You know... there are people helping other people and there are those who grab the camera and film others destroying expensive stuff.  It's all fun and everything but I hate the fact that one guy is standing there and saying nothing.
I would have driven backwards. 🤷‍♂️😂
How about reverse gear? Oh no, I wanna make a statement!
If only they listened to Brother Che.
IoTR..
Not sure why he didnt reverse down
how he got into that position in the first place is what i'm most curious aboot
Great 103 point turn!
This man never misses
he could of just reversed it lmao
Reverse??? This must have been set up to show how the driver can turn around on this bit of road. Otherwise there wouldn't be someone filming. But fair play, done well to manage it. But yeah use reverse next time
I know I am gonna blow some minds saying this, but reversing all the way down would've been easier. Stop the applause, I will see myself out
😂😂😂
Just reverse 🤯
I keep telling you lad. Quite and quiet are different words not be used interchangeably.
Only needed to reverse XD still impressive, but I'd just back up in a few seconds
Reminds me of that Austin Powers scene
They do this stuff on purpose for anyone wondering 😉

ummmm..... cars do have reverse don't they?
Failed successfully?
Why would you not just reverse back down to the bottom?
I just wanted to comment before anyone else...so here it is😂
Yooo

This real?😂
