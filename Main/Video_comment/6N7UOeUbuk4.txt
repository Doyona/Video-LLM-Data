England always fail when they come up against the best teams and that is a FACT born out by its ability to win a national cup be it nations or world cup .NOTHING SINCE 1966 . This time will be no different i promise you. There is a massive question as to why Qatar was even a choice and i think it looks very suspicious. Why is Southgate saying how bad Qatar is with human rights along with many others yet his principals do not go as far as to refuse to go to such a country along with his players .Football, F1, and most other sports and other professions including politicians put making money well above principals , not a nice thing to say but if that is the truth why are we afraid to tell the truth. Greed will in time almost destroy football and F1 .
Well done Italy 🇮🇹  From Australia 🇦🇺
It’s coming to Rome
Kane looks like southgates love child
it's the year 2308 and the brits still chanting "it's coming home" as if they're gonna win the tournament xD
Wish he was sacked why he got a letter il never know. He's nothing special and never will be

You don't understand italian kindness... WE simply understood that you liked your song so much, that we thought you'd like to sing it for another 55 years... that's it!  P.s. humor is not only an english thing, as many English people seem to think... And btw, I haven't seen very much sense of calm irony in the violence before and after the match by the very civilezed english supporters.   Scotland, you don't have to endure them forever!
the song it's about england failing hoever you shoved it in our face too many times and with the part "it's coming home" only so how else where we suppost to take it? Also I fell like some truly used it in arrogance forgetting the real meaning, you know people can change that kind of stuff right?
who was here after England win Euro 2020?
"YOU have to underdstand us".... that's arrogance. the truth is that the whole world has understood what a miserable people you are and what level of meanness you can achieve with amazing ease I am sure you have found a place to put the medal that you so nobly slipped off your neck however, the whole world agrees on what it should be.
Is Harry Kane the only English captain never to win anything at club level?
Even tho British robe india I still love and support them Let's forget the past and make a good future with civilized and educated people  Love and peace everywhere
Rio Ferdinand ----  Nobody can compete with England 🤡🤡🤡  Bonucci ---- E.A.T.  P.A.S.T.A.  🟩⬜🟥
I was soooooooo blessed after england got fronatal punched in the face after the final :D so happy that these arrogant and disrespectful fools didnt win
what? they're not arrogant they're just bunch of drunk twats trying to look special and unfortunately dream too big when they know they support an eternal bottle job team
The sprit is just awesome. Unfortunately it’s coming home is a curse our players are happy to have a bus ride and sign some autographs alittle chitchat on the journey but they never gonna win anything the way they play.
Watching this after the final 😅
I just don't want english people to be happy lol
All the English before the final ‘Football was invented in England’, English after: ‘It’s just a bit of fun, the song is a joke’. I’d have more respect if you knew who you were! Footballs going Rome!
When did Sacha Baron Cohen become manager of England
The problem with England and their fans is that they will never admit that they are arrogant, they will always try and turn it into something else
Now you have plenty of time to enjoy Italian humour.
Hmm hmm. is it Comeing home yet hahahahaha
Ya fooked it up Southgate.  Should of let experienced players take penalties
Hahahaha 🤣😂🤣
- You have to understand english humour. - No, we doesn't have to, especially when it's not humour.  At the origin, it was a comical and auto-derision song... but since few years, it has become their arrogant way to say "it's our sport, not yours, we must win at all costs" and they never win.
Southgate has gone old before his time, he needs to have a shave and get some enjoyment back into his life and hopefully he can pass it onto his team. He looks like he’s carrying the weight of the World on his shoulders, he needs to lighten up and relax a bit. A sly joint would probably do him the world of good. Harry Drane should not be let anywhere near a microphone, they really don’t come much dumber, he makes David Beckham look like Barber Gasgoin.
World Cup 2022 🙏
Sterling stole Denmark's final England get all home games
Yeah obviously
IT'S COMING HOME  Hahahahahhahhahahahhahahahahha! Arrogant tossers! Had whole competition  in unfair advantage and still lost.  -All games at home when  others had to travel thosands of miles, get tested, get threaten they wont be able to play if tested positive and more you travel, bigger chance to pick up virus.  Refusing medal? Arrogant and disrespectful. Booing all national anthems! Racially attacking youngsters for missing the goal. Diving into the final.  Breaking and fighting before, during and after the game.  Be ashamed!
Humour my ass. Fckn arrogant n ignorant
ITALIA
English “humour” is funny. It’s all banter when they dish it out but when they have to take it, they start whining. Now that they’ve lost, they can’t take the “humour/banter” from italian fans and the rest of europe who wanted them to lose.
nice Cola censure
Southgate wouldn't know humour if it slapped him in the face...
Didn't know arrogance is part of the English sense of humour
Italy brought this arrogant, embarrassing bunch of losers to their knees; congratulations to the best team in the tournament, their supporters and their anthem.
if you want others to accept your humour you should also accept theirs, right ? instead you accuse everyone from racism, being offensive, not smart to get your points etc. it is called hypocracy what you do. i would say this is main reason why so many people incl. myself supported Italy in Finals.
Pens, old english Tradition
football gone home to Rome
England is the country that is most hated!!! They used to have a lot of class now there the new germany sad sad what England has become no class what so ever
And yet you stop singing the song when you lose, why are you not singing it your self deprecating song anymore?
Aaaand it's gone!
England are an embarrassment to European and world football. Their fans lacked humility and respect throughout and should be banned from attending England international games in the countries they disrespected.
Blew it big time
British in general, culturally speaking aren't arrogant. They're just presumptuous about entitlement. On top of that, their football fans are classless.
Southgate my Hero, well done with Rashford, Sancho and Saka! Suffer England suffer
hahahahahhahaha! get it up you arrogant cants!
Very naice aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
It will never come home.
Box ticking lost us this game folk's 👍
''we're here to win'' well that went well
karma wins Everybody hates these toxic and disrespectful fans
Bottle job
I think the perceived arrogance comes from the "years of hurt" bit where these are years where England *should* have been winning things when the reality was there were many other great teams who deserved it more.
Did three Black England players all miss their Pens on purpose due to their hatred of British Imperialism ?
Harry Kane has the personality of a damp sponge
The English humor is about sarcasm, how they sing its coming home when it never does.
I don’t think booing national anthems has to do with Humor does it? I don’t think the levels of violence English fans display have to do with humor right? I’m glad these trash people didn’t win. Sucks for the players, don’t have anything against them but i can’t stand English fans and the fact they got so close makes it even more miserable
Except for the idiot kneeling  the team did well
*What a country of LOOOUSERSSSS*  *ITS COMING ROME!!!!!*  🇪🇺 🇮🇹
Every team wants to win above others and this is a national sport, not some kindergarden lego competition! Apparently, the bad attics of a small set of fans represents the mentality of all fans who are in their homes across the world yearning for glory since decades! By that logic, we shouldn’t support AC Milan or Galatasaray cuz of what the fans do in the stadium. The players didnt boo anyone, the players didnt disrespect any country, the players didnt sound cocky. Why should one pull away from a team because “some” of their fans are just a little too hopefull? All those dissing England, stop watching the Premier League then! Bloody Hypocrites! Go England! We are proud of where you reached! Love from India🇮🇳
Yes i understand that English humour is English people are arrogant that's why u lost apparently football coming home but actually its coming Rome
Oof...
Imagine playing a home game and still loosing 😂 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
CAM ON INGERLAND SCOR SOM PENALTIES

I understand the English humour now..it's coming ..it's coming..it's coming Rome❤️😂😂🇮🇹🇮🇹😂😂🇮🇹🇮🇹😂
I thought I was fluent in English until I heard the English captain speak…  I only get perhaps 1 word in 5 …
It's arrogance. Didn't age well at all.
Hahahaha I was right now where are the cocky English, yeh exactly shut up you bigots because football's coming to Rome. Us Roman gladiators slaughtered the 3 lions. This is why you don't hype yourself up too much, you might have the gift of the gab but us Romans shut you up. Now watch the bigots have a go at the young black players because these fans are bigots and loud mouths, football coming to Rome 😆😆😆😆
Great tournament, England! Be proud
Quiet on here now 😂😂😂
I'm ejaculating 🇮🇹🇮🇹
laughing stock of the country. Shame on our team. Absolute duckery
England numero 1
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
How’s the English Humour now? 🇮🇹
Noob
it’s not humour. It’s complete arrogance. Congrats on your loss AGAIN England :)
English Football Team, You've made Your Country proud in Euro 2021.
It z coming to Roma
Sky Sports are a complete and utter disgrace. They had 24 hour ENGLAND ENGLAND ENGLAND. Would it have been the same if Scotland or Wales had progressed instead? Sky Sports also have to stop with the lie that England invented football...they didnt. All they did was to formulate modern rules to a game that had been played since the Medieval period in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England, France, Italy and other countries. Even Hampden Park in Glasgow has a Medieval football on display. Why don't you lot do some proper research and stop with the lies. Anyway, you have the word wrong, it should be ITS GOING TO ROME, ITS GOING TO ROME, FOOTBALLS GOING TO ROME.
Why no new videos?
Yeah!!! Good. Better team won
Bunch of overhyped losers ever...England always win their matches through their bias commentators and media then when they lose they turn on them...I guess the trophy was just visiting home 😂😂 a home that it never even lived on...they did the same thing with the rugby World cup and South Africa gave them a hiding...I am sure the Queen is tired of these disappointments I mean you played almost all your games home and still could not do it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL !🇮🇹 💪
Biggest looser team in every single sport . You must feel so shameful and embarrassed . You were , are and always be the biggest joke in every corner of the Football Planet . You understand that Greece and Denmark are much more successful than you ? 😂
england got there karma for diving against Denmark booing there anthem and shouting there were bringing it home the only thing there bringing home is there failure .. to lose the final on there back yard couldn't be more sweeter Italy saved the shouting they would have done hahahaha failures failures 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹 that's what happens when you start running your mouth and getting over confident.. now for the excuses ..
How many senior Italian players ducked the responsibility leaving it to teenagers to take the 4th and 5th penalties?  Grealish, Sterling and Shaw bottled it. Thats why Italy won
It‘s coming Rome! 🇮🇹
4 world cups, 3 euros, 1 confed cup 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
The English football team are morons.
Southgate Out 😂
Niagara falls 😭😭😭🤣🤣this is what you get when you are disrespectful. Buona notte England
its going home to Rome
*Bending the knee to a money laundering organisation didn't stop England losing. 🤡's*
Ignorant ass ppl should just stfu
yessir now go cry somewhere else england please
The England coach is very bad, but bad with desire ... it has been a total tie-up, on top of the 3 changes that the 2 has taken out with 2 minutes to the end ... on top of it Grilish who is the best of England together With Kane and Sterling, he does not play as a starter!  that he is the best of england does not throw nor a penalty haha!  Well deserved win for Italy offensive futball always win at the end..
Wanna hear a joke?  IT'S COMING HOME 🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂
Hahahahahaha
England? Eng-loser! :D only big mouth and just nothing xD
Dear England. Sit down. All hail the winners from Italy
AHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's what you get if you play chicken
at least we won the war lots of times
Looooosersssss
Drunk tea now
Yesss italia
U lost u losers
See ya later, Southgate.  Only silver lining of tournament.
Yo. You can sub Kane n Sterling....they were absolute zeros today.  Sancho n Rashford apparently do not exist.
so England scored 1 and Italy scored 1
So proud Wembley didn't boo the Italian anthem
Question for Gareth: why are you putting Trippier on? What about Grealish? , Trippier is going to get a yellow card
English fans has no class , bunch of clowns 🤡
I'm rooting for italy but the bitterness towards the English is gone beyond a joke at this stage.
England’s arrogance…it’s a song, not our fault that some don’t have a sense of humour our tradition.
Whatever happens, these boys have created some of the best atmosphere and national togetherness in a long time
The reason why people from other countries don’t like England fans is not because of it’s coming home it‘s because of the people who were booing the other teams national anthem, because many were making fun of that crying German girl and because of the laser pointer incident or Sterlings dive. I am German and most people in my country really don’t want you to win today, some people even seem to hate you. I am not like them cause I know that there’s dumb people in every country and not all England fans are like that but it’s important to know why people don’t like you and not confuse it with something completely irrelevant in this matter.
I suppose that Italian journo has forgot the 90 world cup final when Argentina's anthem was playing - hypocrite!
Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 in Saturday’s Copa America final to secure the national team’s first title since 1993 when they defeated Mexico 2-1 in Ecuador. Angel Di Maria scored the only goal of the match in the 22nd minute.
None of this if we win we are going to win been watching England since the 90s and this is the best England team to come around it’s coming home
Score prediction: 2-0 Italy
Before the Euros end,I need to know this,,do the Coke bottles have a twist cap or do they need a bottle opener?
How can yous all sit there and write 'win or lose were proud'. Typical 'English humour'. Don't be trying to soften the blow if yous get beat. Yous need to BELIEVE that it's coming home. Nothing modest about it either, yous have the best side in decades, don't be lying to yourselves now.
Best Manager ever....best player ever ...amazing other countries flag us off when we support our country...
Salty foreigners whingeing about the country they probably live in hahaha
England 1 Italy 0
We can laugh at ourselves no problem unlike most other countries your not allowed to say anything negative about them they get very upset ( Austrailia-France- all Muslim countries salty Scotland)
The English have humor, thought it was just plain depressing talking
Gareth please put Grealish on full time, he deserves it
Southgate your the one you still turn me on football coming home again!!!! 🎶🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁❤️ smash it boys like we do 🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽
If you actually listen to the song its not arrogant, its about England failing all the time and the little positives we take through the loses. It promotes the blind optimism of England fans that even though we fail often miserably, we still have this belief it will come home.
Get those filthy cokes out of there!
England to win 6 - 0 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏆
Come on Italy, shut these arrogant pigs up, Scotland, Wales and Ireland are right behind you.  It's coming Rome 🇮🇹
Wow what a great diving team, they are so funny! Three divers on a shirt! Football is coming home, to Rome!
Even if we lose we still have to give it to the England team and especially Southgate everyone doubted him but look how far he's come without listening to the pressure of the public
Not long to go now, C'mon England!!
They will be heroes whatever the result. However, the cup will be coming home.
I notice he supports the poisonous sugar water sold by Coca-Cola.
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
It’s the stupidity of saying England is “home” to football just because the laws of association football were set down on paper there.  Other nations that have been far more successful at playing football (Germany, Brazil, Italy, France, …) might find the idea of England as “home” to football daft and irritating, if not just risible.
06:00 Southgate's rebuttal to English arrogance in 3 Lions tune. Spare you 20 mins of Kane's musings.
Everyone who didn’t support England at the start of the tournament or booed during the Scotland should hang their head in shame. Gareth got to a semi final at the WC and has given so many debuts since as well.   He inherited a team that got knocked out by Iceland ffs.
But we're not out !!!!
I garentee england win it's all a set up
How can we be more Arrogant than the Italians, how comes nobody ever calls Spain, Brazil or the French arrogant when the expect to win any tournament they are in. If we win they wont be able to sleep until the world cup starts next year, we dominanted the champions league, Europa cup and now the Euros. Respect what we do as we are without doubt the biggest football nation with the biggest league in the world. We invented football making England the home of the sport.
Did that italian journalist just ask about fans booing another countries anthem??? Italy v sweden 2017??? Sort your own kitchen out before asking questions like that
Sadly sterling dived 😢
And this is what makes Britain great
Best of luck England ...really hope they win ....dont want to see london on fire if they loose
ITALY vs The English Olympic Synchronized Diving Football Team. Thanks God sterling plays football he would beat me on his worst day - Michael Phelps ITS DIVING HOME
Cant stand coke ...pepsi for the win
Southgate und die Brexiter zeigen der Welt wie Engländer wirklich sind. Das Märchen von Fairplay und Toleranz war eh nur eine Erfindung. Wenn man sich die Geschichte der Engländer ansieht kommt man zu einem ganz anderen Ergebnis.
Southgate 🤮🤮🤮
skybet gave me free bet on win spin so i did it on harry getting hatty in final!
Besides from ourselves. I feel every other country wants us lose. Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✌️
only 3 players in the team are actually British even by parents rest are based on immigration including harry Kane have Irish parent ,  the fact these players have played so well as a good team shows the immigration has its positives and hasn't failed the UK! Let that sink in!
yea italy aint lost in 33 or so but if them 33 teams had kane sterling they would of lost most them 33!
Honest, direct & respectful. How refreshing...
About as english as the scottish.. its about time london became a principality and let the real english get on with it
Pointless the Italian reporter brings up a song that has nothing to do with the game , Gareth is the most humble person on earth to ask him a question about english arrogance lol is just stupid, I guess the song really gets up the Italian people's nose lmao, it grates there balls our fans should sing it constantly lol, goodluck England, history in the making, world cup yet let's hope & what about the winner of the euro's playing the winner of the Copa America which was just Argentina again Brazil I think that would be cool a clash of the contents.
Sky news is anti English everything so love the English pride. I'm England till I die bitches 😆 🤣
Harry is very clever. The early stages people were calling him out for being poor, he knows you don't win it in the group stage. Great to hear he has preserved his energy both mentally and physically to be at his peak for the final! Come on England, Its coming home!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁⚽️⚽️
Great mindset sir Gareth...... as a 13yr old in 1996 watching the Euros and watching the penalty shootout it was so disappointing when he didn't score but he's not the only one throughout our history in tournament's .....Tonight yous are living history our whole nation are proud of your acheivments THANK YOU AND BEST OF LUCK
Come on Raheem!!!
Example of English football humour - rival teams used to sing 'wanky wanderers ' at my team, Bolton wanderers.  So, whenever we were winning the home fans would sarcastically sing it back to the opposing teams' fans.    It's similarly sarcastic with this song.  We sing it almost as a cry for help!
55 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming
Win or lose get on the booze
Also why have you not played rashford much 😲
Humor because everyone else knows there a joke
6:00 Tricky question but Incredible answer from Southgate!!
Arrogance: Is to say that you are better than others. Confidence: is self-belief in oneself
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🇬🇧 🇦🇺🇳🇿🇨🇰🇦🇮🇦🇨🇩🇬🇫🇰🇬🇸🇰🇾🇲🇸🇳🇺🇵🇳🇸🇭🇹🇦🇹🇨🇹🇻
It's never been home it's a bit deluded when you claim to have won the Euros is it not.
In Scotland, Wales and Ireland its national pride but for England its Arrogance..... a song about failure, despair and knowing it would end in disappointment...
The man is a class act!
The warmongering queen? She can f*ck off.
'Its coming home'...where exactly? Brazil, Germany, France or any of the other footballing nations with richer history and football culture? 😅😅
Blah blah blah! Let’s see it on the pitch mate.
pickford to shawwww.....shaw to grealishh....grealishh to kane its a goal 1.0 ........phillips to sancho.....sancho to saka....saka to sterling its a goal 2.0 !!!!!!!!!
Love Southgate clapping back with when we go abroad and our anthem gets booed... 👏
Am I the only one who love seeing English fans singing it’s coming home. 💙
Southgate first one I've heard mention when fans boo our anthem it inspires us because they made such a big deal about fans booing denmarks when there fans do the same
Come on England !!!! Haters keep hating
Everyone knows the Italian anthem will be booed, its a tradition..
We all know after 1966 but what happened before 1966 ?     The answer is same .... their entire footballing history they have only one 1966 .....I don't know what will happen against Italy but I have to say England is worlds most overrated footballing nation
England must remember their mascot i.e. the laser show guy🐦
English humour? Disrespectful assholes. They still go on about Maradonna's handball but laser pens, diving, booing national anthems is humour. Absolutely comical
I mean hes not wrong, anyway a song about hoping to win after 55 years is considered arrogant?
England are always been criticised and had negative opinions from every other international teams in sport so when we achieve something like a match they find someone to complain about England was all over Denmark like fat kid and cake and they have the cheek to say what they have said
Hope the fans don't trip off today ....we all are fans nd wen you'll behave crazy the world or places that don't follow the sports look at all football fans as ppl who just wanna be entertain nd can do whatever say whatever during nd after matches ....it's easy man you out wid the kids or family nd friends out cheer who u support if they win or loose life goes on ...
I really hope England wins cause it will really not look good if they loose, I will be the first to laugh if they loose and I pray it doesn't happen.
boo the morons ..... get up of your BLM GESTURE ... boo loud
People saying "It's coming home" isn't a problem. It's the pundits and the disrespect from some England fans that ruins the fun. Booing other teams chants, pointing lasers to distract the goalkeeper whilst he was trying to save a penalty and all the comments about that German Girl crying after England-Germany. Barely anyone has problems with the chants. If my country was in a final, I would be singing in the streets (Irish BTW so them getting into a final is hopeless). The problem is the disrespect from SOME England fans and  the English pundits who sometimes can be stuck far up their holes. Honestly, the only thing I hope is that the match is good. Doesn't matter to me who wins, both teams have likeable players and managers.
Come on England , wish you the BEST of British luck  !!!
Its Coming Home Not Rome
Firstly, in my lifetime we have never been in a final! Southgate should be knighted as every year the team progresses further and further. The man is so passionate for his country and he deserves, whatever the outcome, a massive cheer and love from us the fans and the media! If we win today then that wud be amazing, however, if we lose then i will be gracious in defeat as italy in my opinion have been absolutely amazing for all of their games and certainly the team to beat this year. I would not be disappointed losing to this itsly team. The game will be brilliant, whatever the score and lastly c’mon england!!! Its coming home!!!
I hope England loose they are corrupt they paid for this cup bloody useless
It’s just other countries bitter af because we can all come together as a nation at the drop of a hat over something as simple as football. Just look at the Scots and the front of their papers today, bitter little country they are.
England fans Do not deserve the trophy. F...king morons booing national anthems shooting laser pointer
5:58
The only country in the world where self deprecation is seen as arrogance.
Win or lose, on the booze
I think everyone gets the humour, problem is, it isn't that funny after a few decades of the same shite.
Come on England!!!
The tournaments fixed
Letter from the pm means nothing, joris bonson has no interest in football, but he is riding the wave and using it to his advantage despite 4 weeks ago, refusing to condemn "fans" booing THEIR OWN NATIONAL TEAM FOR TRYING TO MAKE A STAND AGAINST RACISM.
Can you please put on jack grelish
Loving all these salty fans from other countries coming onto our news channels to say they hope Italy win, COME ON ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🦁🦁🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
still wasn't a penalty
Best of luck guys - whatever happens, Kane, Southgate & the rest of the team have conducted themselves fantastically & have represented the country in the best possible way. Now go and win it boys!
Since England is in Finals, ‘It’s coming home’ is now a sign of arrogance. But when they're losing few years ago, other countries just find it silly and delusional.
Good luck England, from unionists north of the border. God save the queen 🇬🇧
Come on Italy!!!!
I actually hope England win. I dont watch TV nor listen to radio so the media cant annoy me. Southgate I liked as a player and as england boss he has taken risks by going for players from anywhere. The teams under him have had a more worklike approach and he doesnt pamper the "stars" like previous bosses have. Mr Southgate should be very content with what he has accomplished.  If England wins they need to thank the guy from the pizza hut advert.
Come on lads!!!!!
Although I believed the Italian is the stronger side but still wish that England can really win the tournament this time. All the best to England. 💪💪💪
It’s coming home
England 👍❤⚽️🏆
Win or lose we’re on the booze
The day has arrived.  Tonight we go head to head against Italy in our first final since 1966.  Let that sink in.  This isn’t the biggest game in years, this is the biggest game of several generations.  There’s people in their 50’s, 40’s, 30’s, 20s, teens and children who have never seen this before.  Across the country families have children, grandchildren, siblings, parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties, nieces, nephews and cousins who have never seen us play in a final.  A country that has been dogged by political division over the past 5+ years, brought together as one.  This is huge for us.
The combination of obnoxious English Media and ”its Coming home” makes for the arrogance most people outside UK think of it. Implying that football has a home can be ”arrogant” as football is a global sport
No mention of Italy booing the spanish anthem during their semi-final at wemberly?
It's unbelievable that other halfwit countries think "it's coming home is arrogant" it's not England's fault if countries devoid of comedy don't get it! FFS. Come on, switch on.
My question to Mr Mancini is how will you prevent your players from diving and cheating tonight? What systems have you put in place to stop that legacy tactic you guys enjoy so much?
People hate England but claim to be die hard fans of English Clubs…..can’t work that one out? 🤷‍♂️
Jesus abraham blinkin, never seen someone blink so much.
title to this video was for the Americans.
you can't put HOLLAND in an England song though surely Gareth
Come on, Three Lions! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽
What an idiot that Norway journalist ?  Why ask such a thing?
To understand English humour I recommend watching Monty python 🤣
Why is no one talking about Diving?   Ohhhh it’s because they’re English.
Good luck England from a Welshman. We will never hear the end of it lol! But good luck and wish you all the best.  Going to be a great game tonight looking forward to it!
🏛️🍕🛵🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹😁
Every Polish person I have spoken to and I work with quite a few have been just as excited and supportive of Englands progression in these Euro's. Beautiful stuff
Come on, England!
I like the legacy numbers, just like in cricket you get an England cap number.
Com on italia
Both so calm, Respect
English Humor is some of the Worst Humor
For me "footballs coming home" isn't just about winning games and trophies, it's about creating a nation unified and spreading joy and beauty to a country.  I firmly believe we've done that and will top it off tonight!
How funny that the rest of the World think we are arrogant because of the Three Lions song. Finding humour in Irony really does seem to be a British only thing.
I love that he addressed the apparent arrogance of English fans and debunked it. Southgate knows exactly what's going on, at the end of the day we're not arrogant but nobody else will believe that so it's fine I've come to terms with that fact now, that's what makes my country special in that we are just cheering on our team and it's classed as arrogance for some reason. Our humour is some of the best in the world and that's why I love all my fellow countrymen. Win or lose today England, you've done us proud. 🦁🦁🦁
If u lose that's a big failure, Denmark were rank 10th, England have had it so easy, journalists asked some terrible questions smh
The Fa need credit for standing behind him and putting a plan in place in 2013 with goals achievable aims roll on the future win or lose so proud of the team for being a team all play for the badge for each other he's united a nation 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
As much as I'll watch them all avidly, I find it ridiculous how many press conferences and interviews Gareth and the team have to do. Surely it isn't helpful in preparing mentally for the game?
Win or lose we are on the booze
They don't understand our humour that's there problem just shows they need to lighten up and live a little rather then cry over everything us English do like Southgate said when other boo our anthem it inspires our team probably because we arnt a bunch of babies
gareth and kane are both so humble how can anyone call them arrogant
English and proud! You have done brilliantly! Do your best, I know you will! Good luck for today lads! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽️🏆
Someone has got in Kane's ear and told him not to use the word "obviously" so much to the press.   You can actually seem him pause for a fraction of a second and then say in a purposeful way "Of course"  instead  lol. Reporter - "Harry do you think Italy will be tough opponents"    Kane -  "Obvious... erm i mean ...Of course" They get coached for dealing with the media as much as they do for football these days.
It’s coming home
I don't think the song is arrogant but I think foreigners are possibly associating the general English arrogant behaviour with the song. The atmosphere around 96 was brilliant. Inclusive. But when England lost to Germany there were people that went out to attack anyone one with a germanish accent and even coloured minorities. But I like Southgate. And his metrosexual approach to politics. This is a calm measured England. Which is what we need now.
Footballs coming home is a reference to when the Euro 96 was being held in England , the first major tournament since 1966 World Cup which we won.
Couldnt of had an easier path to the final, italy to win 3-0 easy men against liberal boys.
Why is so difficult to understand real English
SOUTHGATE YOU’RE THE ONE
It does make me laugh when other nations are willing on to lose. Thinking we're arrogant. We haven't won a tournament since 66, we chant a song which created by comedians and we are a nation of jokers who mock each other on a daily basis.
"It's coming home" refers to England hosting the 1996 Euros. The first major football tournament in England since the 1966 World Cup...
These European nations are so miserable, we laugh at ourselves and Europe can't even understand it. So glad not to be European, come on England!
I will be cheering for England however let’s not talk about England as if it is common practice to be in finals ffs. All this nonsense of first final in 55 years. Call it as it is, ‘ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN A MAJOR FINAL’. Hopefully the Lions Roar. Gareth Southgate is an exemplary human being.
People hide behind the false “english fans are arrogant” mantra to hide their blatant anti-english xenophobia.
I don’t really see many ppl having a problem with the song I think it’s a catchy funny song , reminds me of the summer ‘18 tbh
Very difficult for England,  but not impossible.  Come on lads
Let's not boo the Anthem!! Let's save  the banter for the game!
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  I’m absolutely buzzing for the game and unbelievably proud to be English  Whatever happens you’ve all been brilliant 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Do it for Marrers.
How can it be arrogance? It's a song we keep updating each time we lose, an anthem, tongue in cheek, fun.. and this time, it is coming home!! Even the Germans used it.
I can’t believe in a sporting tournament that they can allow advertisers to put bottles of one the most unhealthy drinks known to man in full show of the world.
Va bene. Ciao tutti. Tutte bene. Cose'e bene e così via etcetera. Io penso che l'Italia cioè volentà martello e batterà l'inghilterra facilemente e semplicemente vimcere di più trofei. Un'altro trofeo per l'italia. Probilement vincere la senze niente problemo sul suolo di casa dell'inghilterra. Arrivederci inglese. Ciao ciao per domenica sera. L'Italia veramente lo megliore squadrà con di più esperienza. Buon fortuna d'italia!!!.....Amuni....Andiamo....tu vede....vedremo.  loro sono eccellente e molte bene. Antonio Jacqui Lucia.
Nobody's ever complained about its coming home..... it looks like we're going to win and they're all suddenly insulted..... wheres the anger over footballs coming Rome? Where is the anger when germans or swiss sing komm bringen heim? European hypocrisy trying to bring us down and turn football into a corrupt event like eurovision.
Congratulations for 3M subscripers. No one does😃
4:33 … YOU TELL ‘EM GARETH!
Looking back on when we first met I couldn't escape I will never forget that Southgate you are the one you still turn me on .... Footballs coming home again 😎🙏😎
Shout out to the players who haven't played or not as much as they would've liked for not throwing their toys out the pram or creating a bad atmosphere. Very different to previous England squads over the years. 👏👏🦁🦁🦁❤️
How is a 55 year wait considered arrogant?  Am I missing something?
I'm Irish so I have a certain dislike of certain things English. But if Garreth was emperor Britain would still be an empire, and thriving.
video ends at 20:20 😳
Its not our fault people dont understand the concept of satire like sorry you've got dead humour I know alot of bitter Non English people are always going to be jealous the sport they love was made by the English, and that is a fact that will remain, so instead of being jealous just say Thank you and move on
Well said, Gareth.
ENGLAND CAN WIN THE EURO THIS SUMMER WITH COMMANDING VICTORY...AFTER 55 YEARS HURT AT MAJOR TOURNAMENT NOW STAGES AT YOUR HOME SOIL TONIGHT AGAINST ITALIA...I PREDICT ENGLAND WILL WIN THE THE HENRY DELAUNEY TROPHY AND GET 10 MILLION DOLLARS EURO (RM58,000,000,00 MILLION)...ALL THE BEST...FROM 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
Southgate is a great speaker.
Hey Alex
When booing the opponents national anthem is an issue, but laserpointing Schmeichel at the penalty (nice dive, Mr Sterling, btw) is no problem at all...I would have rooted for England in the final, but that semifinal changed my mind. This country does not deserve the championship, period.
Southgate is the best English manager of he wins the final
Hey Gareth Southgate
2-0 Italy
I would be totally happy to see England win - but Southgate needs to skip the war stories, it is not 1980 anymore. Greetings from Germany and all the best for the final.
the italian journalist is a disgrace. we will beat your country. come on ENGLAND
Today is going to be the day that  Footballs heading back to Rome  Bye now you shoulda somehow  Realised that Harry’s gona win f’all I don’t believe that anybody thought it was a penalty  Against the Danes
Vindaloo world in motion 3lions, what a football play list
Forza Italia - from a scouser 🖕🏽
The English are arrogant
It’s coming home ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿I love our manger he is brilliant and all our England players have played brilliantly just amazing football ⚽️ I love you my England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 I know this is our time it’s coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
We can all admit, the English media in meltdown is much more fun to watch.
This is all superfluous. Let’s just play football for fuck’s sake.
The Queen and prime minister sent letters!! No pressure then lads hahaha
You lot are a cocky bunch
Southgate is the right manager for the England team..definitely keep the players well grounded before the final. He has come in and done well.
The problem with anyone having grievances about a song is that they don’t have a life or understand self deprecation. England haven’t been in a final for 55 years arrogance is therefore talked of by idiots. People should just be honest about their hate and not try to project it on England.
England ...were her to win at any cost ...yeah eaven if we have to dive like a dolphin we will.
COVID IS COMING HOME!!
Father son duo 😂
Football is going to ROME 🇮🇹
All these foreigners saying all this bad stuff about the England team and supporters are mainly the same foreigners who live here taking out our system.Laughable really
I love watching these but boy don’t the media ramble on with the questions 🥱
Karma in the final. Italy will win.
You dont deserve to be in final you won the game by cheating cheating and cheating.
England loose, EU’s fault. England win, because they are out of the EU. Italy all the way. Go Scotland, greetings from Australia.
Notice how the best questions come from the European journalists outside of England, just confirmation of how bad the journalism / punditry in this country really is.
England is number 1  😻
Sure, but booeing the opposition anthem and pointing lasers towards players which can do permenant damage is not appropriate. Thats why people hate the english fans, not because some childish chant.
Given the fact that the song referred to hosting the tournament and not winning anything, football IS coming home regardless of the result simply because it's being played in Wembley.
Thank God we left the EU.
It's also the fact that football, like rugby and cricket are all English inventions. If you went down that route of thinking, then England winning in any of those international sports means the sport has 'come home'.
I just watched Argentina 🇦🇷 beat Brazil 🇧🇷 1 -0 to win the COPA America Cup, England will beat Italy 3-1 this evening.
Good luck England you can do it !
To the people saying that England aren't in Europe anymore... Go back to school.
Marcello’s questions were good. But generally the press is still our problem. Why would any English journalist ever mention 1966, or pressure, or expectation. It’s as if they want to sabotage us.   This video has changed my mind about ‘Football’s coming home’. I had never listened much to the lyrics, so never fully appreciated the self-deprecation. I feel slightly better about it now. But only slightly. I never enjoyed Baddiel and Skinner to begin with.   The Chinese must get confused when they hear it, having played ‘cuju’ (kick ball - no hands allowed) during the Han dynasty. England’s contribution was to introduce a load of rules to spoil the fun. This culminates with the misuse of VAR. And apparently now the top of the arm no longer constitutes handball but Bobby Firminho’s armpit does.
The fine hour shortly pat because north korea willy allow athwart a arrogant george. alike, fine flesh
Were english and proud the song we sing for the team and hope it's coming home and still sing it if we dont that's england for you and how does it make us arrogant it was made by two great comedians
Hope we win more than anything, regardless tho this team is young full of potential and if they carry on improving we could be a dominant force going forward. Not being over confidant at all but our bench would walk into most international teams.
come on england..from holland  good lock today
I really hope England loses, all games played at home, penalties made up, hopefully IT'S COMING TO ROME!!!
80% of these questions are so so so poor.
Try living in the uk it torture, they wont shut up about it, actually think they are a good team lol! Deluded.
How are the lyrics arrogant football's coming home 🤣🤣,we created the game didn't we ??
Don't worry because football will he coming home to Italy, us Italians will take the three lions just as the Romans used the lions in the past. Just you watch English arrogance will be shoved back in your face when we beat you in your own garden 😚
What is all this garbage about England being arrogant. Arrogant about what? I think something has been lost in translation.  Self depreciating humour isn't being arrogant.
You will never understand why people think England is arrogant. It's not just about a "it's coming home", we know that's a joke and we make fun back at u to which u respond "we invented football" but it's just those things like Gary Neville saying he DOESN'T CARE that England got a cheap penalty against Denmark. Is that also "English humour"?
Dry your eyes when you loose footballs going to Rome
Well spoken Gareth, very few people understand British sense of humour. Will be rooting for you and your team. Good Luck
I like the English football team, but the referee blew the wrong penalty, if England won the euro it would not be glorious. Millions of neutral fans have turned away, and I am one of them.
09:32  "How do you bottle that?"  Harry Kane : "Well obviously I play for Tottenham, bottling it is what I'm good at"
I remember watching the hand of God, Waddle’s penalty, Gazza’s toe, Southgate’s pen, Beckham’s red card, Ronaldinho’s ‘cross’, Lampard’s unnoticed goal, Iceland, Croatia. Nearly men, egos, flawed geniuses, racists, drunk drivers, violent assaults.   Now we have a group of ubër professional young men working with experienced professionals as a team. Young polite, well mannered, lads who are technical, cultured footballers who look like they get told off for staying up playing FIFA too late rather than jumping into a dentist chair or shagging grannies. This group champion anti-racism, donate massively to the NHS, are donating a big chunk of the prize money to the NHS, they champion LGBTQ+ rights, and feed the poor school children of our country. The manager is humble and proud without being a sycophantic nationalist AND he’s a modern tactically adept manager who isn’t afraid to make a decision yet is warm, friendly, approachable, and honest.   It’s been such a great ride for all the country whatever happens tomorrow. Win lose or draw this tournament has reinvented what the England football team means to English people. Also this team and their progression in the competition has lifted the whole nation and given us something to talk about to each other and given us moments to share that aren’t pandemic/politics/misery related ❤️🤍❤️🤍
It's not so much arrogance. Its the fact england always say they're already in a final without even playing their opponents yet. Utter lack of respect to the rest of teams. not just now, they been doing it for decades.

🇯🇲🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
This is like saying some stupid sh*t, then putting “lol” at the end.
southgate=ole england=man u. i can predict this final
I'm a Southgate fan, what a respectful geez
As a boy, my father handed me the 'life sentence for the crime I never committed' of being an Oldham Athletic fan. My first game was in 1981. Last May was the fortieth anniversary of the last time we won anything, no cup, no title, no promotion, nothing. England reaching the semi final of a world cup and now the final of a European Championships is a truly remarkable thing. For people like me, who lived England's tournaments in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998...and the list goes on.... we that have had to put up with so much soul destroying disappointment at club level, this is a truely marvellous thing that Gareth has achieved, and that even if we lose the final. Get behind the team and the manager, this is a fantastic ride and stick your paper planes where the sun doesn't shine and don't boo Il Canto degli Italiani, it's a great tune!
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏆
We shouldnt care if they lose, even if its 10-0 to italy. They have never come this far in my lifetime.
Haters gunna hate
Do I think “It’s Coming Home” is arrogant? No, it’s optimistic and hopefully and calling it arrogant feels like a bit of a misunderstanding.   On the other hand, do I think the English fans and media come across as arrogant in other ways - yes, all the time!
Who is going to win?  Pengland?  Or Penaltaly?
Kane "err yeah of course, errr obviously"....thank god he's brill at football
First Italian question v salty, why not ask something genuine
3-2 to Italy England score early then Italy come back with 3 England score 1 but it's too late and game ends 3-2 Let's see I guess, as a spurs fan I've seen it all before with the expectations and form just proving futile when too defensive.
Fair play to Southgate and the team. They've done the whole country proud even if we lose. A great journey this tournament has been.
It's an English game, end of, like many others, we've given a lot to this world, show us some gratitude please.
Kyle Walker, Sterling, Stones, Foden. Thank you Pep. On a serious note, the talented managers the premier league now attracts has contributed heavily to the success of the national team. Pep, Klopp etc have instilled in the players a  professionalism and winning mentality like never seen before.
I'm not hearing or seeing the arrogance, they've taken every opponent seriously, people make up narratives in their heads based on very little...if any arrogance is there it's the pundits and fans
I have a big feeling that England is gonna win tomorrow 😃 good luck 🤞 I’m with you with all my heart ❤️ greetings from Poland
6:00 Is the part you're looking for
Best of luck England, do the business and you'll never be forgotten, and that not only from England fans.
Upset over a song…..really?
Either way it goes im proud they got this far, they have evolved so much as individual players and have formed an amazing unity
Thank you the Norwegian journalist for actually reading the lyrics rather than casting lazy aspersions out of a lack of understanding.
Let’s all hope England win after All There’s Years. Thank you to Channel 4 for putting the 1966 Match on This evening. It was a Joy to watch
Too much pressure. They don’t need that. I hope they have people there to help handle it. The bottom line is that it is just a game. Yes a special one from our point of view; but the moment it becomes something else for them it also becomes something way too hard to achieve. Sport psychology can be a bitch if out of control…
Imagine Italians making jokes about diving 😂😂😂
As a Welshman, almost everybody I talk to, well alot just say fuk England. As in footy. But I've supported them all my life in major tournament. Wales only having qualified for one not that long ago.. But, this tournament and me following England throughout and having my interest in football re ignited, I'll fukkin love it if they win it tomorrow.  I supported both when Wales still in, and would support Wales if played each other. But, Come on England
It's coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
My god some of these questions are so dopey 😂
Never seen so many ads in one video. Chill out Sky - you don’t need the money
England could become the biggest meme of Europe is they lose tomorrow with the it's coming home shite , gareth southgate song , Atomic kitten song...
"Trina get our heads around it"?! 🥴 kane sterling sancho rashford saka foden mount kalvin lewis... are you hearing that attack? If we didnt go far as the faviorites it would have been a disapointment. But it coming home 😅
More arrogance expecting the whole world to learn how to joke. Shocking.
Southgate= class act
U guys are going to lose dude,u don't deserve to be in the final,u rob Denmark
england have no humour
It's like when we sing we're gonna win 5-4 when 4-0 down..  When we pretend that our team has scored a goal when losing 5-0
The strange paradox of the non-English world is that they are fascinated by our humour but never actually 'get' it. They take themselves and their heroes ultra seriously and are perplexed that we don't act exactly the same way. Thing is, if we followed the expected lead, great creations like football wouldn't exist. 🤷‍♂️
The whole world will support Italy!
Lol u can tell they are completely focused when he referenced the Denmark game as a "midweek game, lol I honestly believe they thinks it's middle of season in the prem lol. Cushy! Bring it home lads, your legends already, now go become knights!
Southgate really has come a huge way as a manager. He's really grown into the role and comes across as a top class manager. CMON ENGLAND!!! Buzzing for the game
The amount of spackas that think we think we're winning every tournament no matter what just because we have a song for the tournaments we're in 😂
It's not arrogance, it's beliving in the team and there's nothing wrong with that.
A semi-final and a (at worst) final in two tournaments is great going. This is an easier England team for neutrals to like than previous ones. It seems far more of a team. Italy are also really likeable so I'm hoping for an entertaining and dramatic game. Two things to watch are whether Sterling can isolate a defender to get at and whether Jorginho gets space to dictate the game. I wonder if he'll be tempted to bring Henderson in?
Italy 🇮🇹
media at it again you have won nothing yet
He is absolutely unflappable. Fair play Gareth, I hadn’t seen much of him before the run and had my own ideas about him but my god, he’s completely flipped me round.   A calm, measured man with steel… that’s not the sort of man you want to manage against.
Why do people keep saying if we don’t win it’s ok no it’s not ok we need to win
Henderson is a much more fulfilled captain than Kane. Kane has been average. Sterling is has been better than Kane.
I sincerely wish with all my being that England wins the final .  Italy can win next time, but this time it should be England and only England and no one else.
VENI.VIDI.VICI.
Come the world against her England shall yet stand. Come on England. I support England after Switzerland they will avenge us
Scotland only managed 1 point but also are very angry about England making the final only conceding 1 goal.... muppets
World cup won and final!!  England 1 world cup won e no final Italy 4 world cup won  e 2 final ( 1970 / 1994)
Born and raised in England. It’s arrogance
Tournament has prety much been tailor made for England to win
Phillips and Rice start confirmed
England vs the world
Love Gareth ⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁🏆
Whatever happens tomorrow I hope, that we meet in the final again the next world cup.  I really respect this team and especially Soughtgate.
2-1 England!!
This tournament has only proven that no one understands our humour. They think its arrogance, us singing a song about how we hope and fail every time.
Come on England! Don’t let the pasta boys beat you!!!
C'mon lads let's go again for as many dodgy penalty calls in our favour as we can. Be proud and dive for England. 🇬🇬 🥇🏆
I hope we win I have faith in this England team and Gareth but even if we don't win think we've still made history this Tournament, But I have faith we will win come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🍻
Go Italy. I sincerely hope England loses. Preferably with more than 2 goals. I never felt so much animosity against another national team and their hooligans like I do the English.
I realised a while ago theres no point trying to explain it to the crybabies, they know, they just don't care and want any stick to beat you with
Having kane as captain is a joke the most over rated striker of all time. IMO

ITS OURS GO ENGLAND MAKE US PROUD….AN AMAZING TEAM AND A CLEVER MANAGER
Never in my lifetime have I been so proud of an England team, southgate has more than embodied what english football means to us, especially in the light of all our difficulties in the last 2 years. Just want to say, win or lose, we are so proud, thanks gareth ⚽️ 🥳
For English people: "It`s going Rome" is a song recently written by non-english fans that probably wish England football failures to continue. It`s a song about keeping the heartache of being a english football fan and wipe out the optimism of one day winning something. We say it 100% serious specially after the disgraceful behaviour of fans towards Denmark (the most recent) with laser lights pointed to danish players. To support a team, be passionate in all possible ways and beyond but fair with oponents.
They also got a letter today from Matt Handcock requesting another pay cut
England with his unfair supporters will lose. Europe is supporting Italy, big up italy. 4:1🤙
Come on England on Sunday   beat Italy   please don't mess it up play well in the second half and first half we all know you can do it we got faith in you
30 years of hurt never stopped me dreaming - it’s what fans of all clubs over the world (bar the few massive ones that win regularly) feel - it’s song about failure but hoping
Roar the team to victory but whatever you do, don't boo 'the knee'...
Italy are arrogant fans, team  and journalists expect to win, dissmiss the English players and elevate their own players above Englands on what basis?  English fans hope to win but majority recognise it very very tight.
Tomorrow the Queen of England will be watching this game... Her country and her majesty herself have undergone such personal loss this year! Let's go out and do it for her! Good Luck Boys!!
F**k all the foreign haters, it’s coming home to where it belongs you scum bags 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I’m more surprised they still get letters and not a tweet from old Liz and Bojo
I want England to win purely for Southgate
So "its coming home" is a joke😂😂 not your home
People hate the English. The jealous runs deep and always will. They wouldn't go after a nation that they didn't see as a threat. but it is ok. We just soak it up and move on :)
Just happy to see us in a final. I've been waiting almost as long as the last time we got to one!🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💪
We created football, and thats what we mean when we say its coming home. First Ever club Sheffield FC First ever united Sheffield united
I don't see how it's so difficult for other nations to see that we are genuinely having fun and a joke around with "It's Coming Home". If you see our past history with tournaments and the heartache we've had to endure, then can you really blame us for doing something like this? It's all in the name of a bit of fun and shows that we don't take ourselves seriously
34 in a row
Arrogance will turn to 120 thousand crying eyes tomorrow night.
For a small Country we seem to get under a lot of people’s skin 🤣
England 2 - 1 Italy Let's go!
Brilliantly calm and focussed from both manager and captain - what a time to be an England fan!
the ref is key
We must score first englannnnnd come on
If you don't like the flag and being patriotic, then you're in the wrong country.... 100 years ago you would have classed a traitor and strung up... So many entitled moany idiots following the bots (fake accounts on twatter) because they don't understand how to form their own opinions... The victim olympics is coming to an end - what will you do and where will you hide with your turd medals?...
Great reply from Southgate about our Nation Anthem being booed abroad
Rightly so.  VAR  is 12th man for them since semi Final and playing in home with fans ready to boo other country's national anthem. Perfect.👏👋
BRING IT HOME ENGLAND!!!

Im a Brit living in Spain and I was so negative about this comment because I see it as the Europeons see it but today I have been taught a lesson
England fans in the stadium don't boo their national anthem it make us English people all look like idiots which isn't the case
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, ENGLAND!
It’s pathetic they even have to speak about that - be proud of ur nation.

Imagine that letter from boris.go out there and make us proud, wear face masks where ever possible but remember not to wear a face mask and act rationally whilst remaining social distancing dont forget to huddle before the game or else I'll get john terry and matt Hancock to visit your wife's. We will beat this virus. Boris x
If they thought them boos were bad wait till the whole country booooing tomorrow  😮😮😮😮😮😮
To everyone saying England don’t deserve to win and that’s it’s lucky they played at Wembley for 90% of their tournament I just want to mention Italy have a trophy in their cabinet that was won on a coin toss
Let this be the beginning of nationhood and identity away from the shackles of the EU.  I pray st agusteen and st GEORGE look to a new England flying there st GEORGEs flags with love in there hearts.
Southgate is the best advert for our country we could wish for.
Yeah Ovishly 😂

You wanna be a legend like CR7 you gotta move that coke
I want England to win just so I could say Harry Kane leaves Spurs and wins a trophy.
ITS COMING HOME
I can't understand why English fans singing a song in support if the England football team is arrogance. We all know if Italy win, they will be singing it back in our own backyard. We expect that, it's part of the banter between supporters of different teams.
This tournament has shown how much animosity countries the world over have towards the English. We are even hated by people within the country I'm proud to be English win or lose Sunday come on England 😊 I must add I feel this is the fault of the English media and government not the people
Both times England has made it to an international final, the best striker in the squad played for tottenham ;) (Jimmy greaves won the wc)
English football fans are simply dumb. It's really that simple. That's why they have these idiotic chants like COME ON ENGLAND!! ''come on'''.... how brilliant. It's coming to ROME
So in other words england aren't arrogant every other country in the world is just too stupid to get english humour
I'm gonna be there. 🤗🤗 It's coming home!!!
Love how triggered people from other countries get when we support our own team in our own country lol. Still doesn't stop said individuals from wanting to live in our country and experience the fruits of its labour. Some people must be gluttons for punishment. Go figure.
I dont think its not understanding the humor at first it was humorous then came a point where too much of a good thing is bad for you and it just started irritating a lot of people not just the neighboring countries, it don't matter tho everyone is entitled to their own opinion but damn the English media sometimes, SHOCKING! Hoping for an entertaining game tmr
The 55yr drought is not a guarantee to victory, this match will be played and won in the field at the end of 90mins or120mins. Remember you are playing with rough and tricky italians, don't count you chicks before they are hatched.
8:02 I thought she was gonna say “I’m wondering how you are dealing with reaching 100 years old” 😂
English fans arrogant!?😲 No way!(sarcastic voice)😂
What a man!
I kinda wish they had kept the line  Butcher at war.
7:1 for Italy I guess
We simply want to win - wenger! Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🙏🏽
@6:00 idk if someone has already done this but here ya go👍 Oh and…it’s coming home!!!
9:32 kane has the spurs mentality. He is the expert on bottling
Win or lose we’re on the booze
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Was that a Danish sore loser asking the question about it's coming home 🤣
Southgate to Real Madrid  👑
No subtitles again for Kane? Can't understand a word he dribbles from his mouth
Come on guys, do it for us all. I don't like booing of the anthems at all.  I always support our neighbour's too, Ireland, Scotland and Wales some of my favourite players have come from those neighbour's , Johnny Giles, Billy Brenner, Gary Speed. I could go on.......Let's just do it tomorrow and I hope Kelvin Phillips scores the winner :0)
He gets it knight him now
Please mark Chiesa and Insigne. Go Lions!
Its coming rome.
Win or lose boys you have done us proud.. just go out there and give your all like every fan would and we will love you for it..  Three Lions on a shirt,Jules Rimet still gleaming,Thirty years of hurt,Never stopped me dreaming!!!!!
COME ON ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁
There just having a laugh , I’m Irish and think it’s great song by two great comedians and lightening seeds . People take notice of everything theses days
Gareth Southgate is a wonderful human being.
Bring it home lads
Harry Kane is so polite and professional in his interviews 🤟mad respect ✊
England can't do it..it's Italy ffs..but they're going to do it...just watch!
The song It's Coming Home was written in 96 because England was hosting the Euros. First time hosting a major tournament for 30 years, since world cup 1966. The line is football's coming home. Meaning the tournament itself. Not the trophy is coming home. That was just hoped for, but not the original point of the song.
And with just the words "you have to understand english humour" gareth has just displayed the arrogance people are talking about. Everybody gets your humour. O.k. its no big mystery. England and the usa are the most arrogant countries in the world make excuses but nobody is buying them🤡🤡🤡🤡
Harry kane we want goals from you against Italy and when you score push the team for the next one then next, keep playing till the end
Club careers. Easy for you too say capt.
Interesting hearing Harry say he basically ran out of steam against Croatia in World Cup. Peaked too early
I've never seen a team with more advantage at a tournament than england, with the final at wembley tomorrow, england would have had home advantage 6 out of the 7 games they played in the euros, everyone knows sterling dived and the penalty should not have been given plus there was another football on the pitch so play should have been stopped
Mate what I wouldve given to hear one of them say the German girl called she's wondering if you lot wanna cry with her about it 😂😂😂😂
Good luck to the English boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. Love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
It’s important our fans respect the opposition, yes Gareth, singing along to the oppositions national anthem and cheering on their goalie with a laser pen in the eye during the penalty was truly heartwarming!
It’s only arrogant if you can’t properly speak English lol
I love how the narrative is the world must support the good honest Italians, who invented diving and had a team (Juventus) literally demoted due to match fixing.
I like Southgate but there's a big difference between arrogance, humour and confidence there's also a word in the English dictionary that is seldom used for a English man which is very annoying and that word is humble!!.
C’mon Italy!!!
I was Born in 55 It's Been 55  long Years since we Won Something. It's a omen Footballs coming Home 🌝 LOL🌝
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
we must not fall at the final hurdle

We are England and were bringing this baby home!!! To 🥳🥳 let's do this lads England will be electric and all behind you all the best England
Come on england ❤️
Yeah. No. Of course. Obviously.   It's coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
bring it home lasers at the ready we got his
I told my European girlfriend That Southgate and Kane were father and son. His name is Gareth and they call him Gary for short. So it's Harry and Gary Kane. She believed it and thought it was unfair that he played his son and this went on until quarter final then I let the penny drop. I must say they definitely could be father and son I could also see a pizza hut advert in the future for Kane🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
England
Stand by your team people!
English humour: aka imperialist racism. 😉
You english i promise you will cry......remember my words you will cry harder......see most of you underestimate italy try flash their form over yours ......you will cry....we will meet here in comment section with your someone to blame someone as your scape goat ....you will cry i promise
24hrs to make history lads!!! looking forward to it
Who actually gives two phucks what foreigners think? I don't know anyone, we do what we want and we say what we want, and if that upsets you then go cry in a safe space.
Italy fans complaining about England cheating!?.....one of the most corrupt footballing nations ever.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 its coming home
PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLESEPLEASE!!
divers and cheats !
Football journalists ask the dumbest questions
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I thought we said it's coming home because we invented the game/ rules and have the oldest clubs etc?
England living rent free, love it
I'll be absolutely gutted if we lose but win or lose we should be proud of our team for getting to the final! It's been a brilliant ride let's just hope it doesn't end now
SOUTHGATE YOUR THE ONE, YOU STILL TURN ME ON, FOOTBALLS COMING HOME AGAIN🏆
They're not arrogant they're English, with a special and unique sense of humour. They're Arrogant and superior, the lyrics of the song reflect exactly how the English see themselves to be and deserves the derision it gets from everyone.
John 3:16
Dear Europe, our national pride saved your arses, twice. Never forget you’d all be speaking German if it wasn’t for us.
Other countries don’t realise we just love winding them up most of the time we don’t actually think what we’re saying, just do it for a reaction
It's starting already and they haven't stolen the final yet.obe's,mbe's+ knighthoods.endless documentarys.i really hope Italy win
If WAR don´t work, why the hell bother...
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁❤❤❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
As an honest england colonializer fc fan i have to admit that we will lose to italy 🇮🇹
Football’s diving home. It’s diving home. It’s diving home. It’s diving.
I’d say same team but bring in Henderson for Philips. He’s been there and done it
DO IT TOMORROW LADS!!! COME ON ENGLANDDDD 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁
I'm Irish and it's coming home
Funny how everyone says always route for the underdog but when it’s England v Italy everybody hates England. As if we are the 1st nation to benefit from a dubious referee decision. Simeone anyone? Suarez? Lampard disallowed goal? Maradona? Henry? But no eNgLaNd iS cHeAtErS. F all of you. It’s coming home.
Hes a clown need to ues his subs
EPL >> Seria A  Let's go England!!
Come on lads!!
I'm just an armchair supporter having to watch all the games on the tv, but since the groups stage I have hardly had a full nights sleep. I'm stressed out mot of the time, anxious and unable to eat properly. I can't concentrate on anything other than football, England and what the outcome of this final will be. I am so proud of this group of players and all the coaching staff and especially Gareth Southgate. How they are coping with the pressure is beyond me. I am a wreck and in awe at the strength of these boys. COME ON ENGLAND!
Always find a way to be negative. Media is cancer.
A letter from a lying prime minister is worth not very much
Win or lose football already came home for the fans who are under 55.. for once its not our media putting pressure on us its the rest of Europe 😆😆 good and bad runs always end at some point..
It is not coming home it's going to Rome 😂
They sure look like brothers...🤣🤣🤣
After cheating
🦁🦁🦁
Italy will dominate England in the final. The English will be outclassed the Euro trophy is going to Rome.
*IT'S COMING HOME!!!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿*

As an Englishman who spent many years living and working abroad and being treated really well in every country. Is anyone who's not from England supporting England?
And the pen ppl are moaning about. Was contact hmm we need some luck my god!! Or the laser
This isn't as a result of English/British humour. The Welsh or Scots don't act like England booing opposing anthems
It’s CUMMING home
Its coming rome 🇮🇹⚽️🇮🇪
Amazing England come on lads
Play for the badge on the front and we won’t ever forget the names on the back 🙌🏾🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🙌🏾 come on England!!!!!!!!!!!!!💪🏾
I think the game will be dictated by the battle between the Italian midfield and our 2 holding midfielders rice and Phillips. Hopefully the Yorkshire pirlo will have another great match
Born 1971, had a lifetime of heart breaking moments….please let this be our salvation….it’s coming home🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
A lot of angry Scotland, Ireland and Wales fans that ironically support English clubs 🤡🤡🤡
Biggest occasion in 55 year pile on the pressure,imagine how the players feel today the whole country on them.
Nobody ever mentioned us, now we are all they can talk about, ITS COMING HOME!!!!
Not first
It’s coming home. Come on lads. Smash it and write yourselves into history. Our country is all behind you. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
It's coming Rome
Win or lose, we've made history and that's a huge win for us as fans, however you don't do all that hard work to get to a final to just "blow it away cos I know we can play" let's bring this home! Just a shame rival's are so salty! And when we win tomorrow bitter fans will definitely be finding excuses as to why we shouldn't of won! 😂😂 Good luck England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁
He’s actually got this spot on!! I think the booing is also very much explained by this too… we don’t think we are better than anyone else (I’m English)!  It’s just done to generate atmosphere… obviously we want to help our team win!! IT’S COMING HOME!!!!
We’re just rent free in the rest of Europe’s heads
“ our humor is unique “ your humor is garbage I mean people are just miserable all the time   When it comes to black comedy the Egyptians do it better than the English
English don’t have humour they’ve got something called deludedness
Come one england!
Came home Came home 🏡😌🙌💕
deluded
Nobody ask him about his WW2 comments, no?
I love how upset people get when English people support their country
My heart says it’s coming home, my head says it’s going rome.
Booing an anthem, diving and pointing lasers at goalkeepers is the reason why everyone in Europe will be supporting Italy, not this it's coming home bs
Bullshit England, diving in to the final... -Maybe another home game as well?
England's journey this tournament is a funny one.. Started the competition low on confidence on their coach and players.. And now, the most overconfident living beings in the entire world
The Italian job 2: Wembley
Since Wednesday night all I've heard and read is negativity towards England, like no other country has ever benefited from a dubious decision ffs. Bring it home boys the whole country is behind you!!
Kane : It’s coming home yeeeeeahhh obviouslyyyyy
For non-English people: ‘It’s coming home’ was a song written by comedians that was nearly banned by the English FA as it was so negative about England’s football failures.  It’s a song about the heartache of being a football fan but the optimism of one day winning something.  We don’t say it being 100% serious, it’s a bit of fun & supporting our team!
Ar somali badana meeshan. Cadaankan maxaa naga galay
If we lose we are going to get absolutely slaughtered by every other country in the world.
England: *Win a penalty* Their fans with lasers: *It's my time to shine* 🌟🌟
Just to let you know England are the only thing coming home , not the trophy
This guy is a knobhead. Confirmed.
It's coming rome
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
1:50 what kind of question was that
"and the letter from the prime minister as well"  Bet Rashys face was a picture and a half while that was being read out.
It’s the world vs England and we’re winning they just can’t handle it
Booing national anthems is more arrogant than chanting its coming home.
Breaking news: In the final, an Italian player will be blown away with a bazuka in the name of English humour
Haha Even him saying that is in the way of a  Joke haha
"British humour" Southgate  -  2021
Come through Italy!!!!
Southgate has been our best manager 100% since Sir Alf Ramsey!
What about the arrogance of their pundits and their media? Is that all just a joke too?
Football’s real home is the streets of Brazil !
as soon as a westham player is back in the squad we actually do something
Let’s hope they can bring it home
They can’t handle the English
I’m from Portugal and I Only understood half of this interview where is the guy on the left from?
