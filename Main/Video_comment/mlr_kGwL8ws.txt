I prefer trucks made before certain years.
The fact that Billy's stuffing is riding up and making it look like he's got triple D anime boobs is killing me.
My daily driver is a 77 F150 4x with a 351 Cleveland. Normal wear n tear parts replaced every so often but original motor and tranny. Well over 365,000 original miles on it and I haul a 20 ft 2 axle trailer most days filled with logs or bails of hay or straw. Yep I'm a farm boy. No need to buy a new model.
Love that old Ford
Sorry that old truck is cooler
100% on team rust bucket, no comparison
Lmao, I got a '81 F-100 with a 300 6 engine, 4 on the floor,  and a long bed. It's painted more of a copper color than a brown and doesn't have the lift kit but never the less it looks a lot like this classic truck gang truck. I've been working on getting it running for several months. The guy who had it before me abused it and rigged pretty much everything in it to keep it running without actually fixing anything. I've had to rebuild and replace pretty much everything except the transmission and the body. After Thanksgiving I'm dropping a rebuilt 300 6 in it to replace the old one that he burned the valves and screwed up the lifters in. Then I'm rebuilding the old engine and I'll switch them out as they wear out. I ain't buying another truck for the rest of my life I'll just keep rebuilding this one. They'll be lucky if I don't make them bury me in my truck when the time comes. Truck Gang!!!!!!
im watching this in 2025 the six seven lol
If when instantly possible yall as the world population make it home safe weather you read comment or not
My family is all about American steel, my family goes back before the revolutionary war in Virginia. Thiers no craftsmanship, they make them cheaper and charge more. Car makers need to take a Henry Ford approach
Easier to work on, lots of reasons people like classic vehicles from the 80s on back. But what I thought was completely stupid about this video is how he didn't even mention the steel..... That's my biggest issue with newer vehicles, harder to work on, not made as good.
Im 36, and my dad is 70. He has a 72 restored GMC pickup, 66 Chevelle and 55 Chevy, everyone of these vehicles he found and restored and brought back to life.
As a guy who owns both a newish truck and a old 77 jeep, i can agree with the guy in the old ford. Electronics are only nice if your balls got sucked too far into your stomach
You want to sell the Ole ford
Whats wrong with 260 AC?
As someone who owns a 94 ranger i can relate to the classic hahah
In my experience, newer vehicles are actually more reliable BECAUSE the computer can tell you exactly what's wrong, whereas a mechanic working on your old vehicle might be right, or more often then not, he misdiagnosed your vehicle and you spent money on a fix you didn't need. Then again, if the computer fails that's an expensive fix, but I still prefer modern vehicles. My 01 Ram 2500 has 413,000 miles on it right now and still going because if the engine light comes on I know exactly what to replace.
I will take both
I will have that old ford over and new plastic crap pile
I loved this ! So perfect
I love Trucks, the new ones are luxury yachts with crazy power and 7 year life spans for $100k... I can fix old ones, I think i'll keep using the old ones.
25 year old geezer here 🤣
Growing up is realizing the old truck is nice it has body style and soul but the new truck offers ease of life let the vehicle do the hard work for you keep you warm, light the bed area, plugins for trailers and more
🤠Thanks Billy!
I'd rather drive that old Ford than any new modern truck today
This funny but I gotta hand it to the classic trucks, they are just better in every aspect, specifically anything built late 70's into the 80's like those damn square bodies, or my personal favorite the 79 Dodge W150 god damn those trucks are beautiful
Rather have old truck and mule team  when HEMP hits!
The more gizmos, the more problems as they age.  These newer vehicles will never be Classics, they don't have the Heart and Soul of the pre 2000's vehicles.  Everything today could be shut down by a bad sensor or something else.  Back when the Real Trucks were made, they just needed a couple of wires and combustion LoL.  Of course I know today's vehicles can run circles around the older stuff.  But the longevity of the older vehicles will never be matched by these overly engineered vehicles.
Modern trucks are truly amazing in their comfort and capabilities.  Just God forbid they break outside of warranty. The cost of repair is out of control. Even my 01 f250 cost over 5 grand to  replace the tranny. If the transmission in my 68 dodge truck ever fails I could buy another for a couple hundred bucks on Facebook.  I could probably buy a rebuilt for less than 2g and do it in my driveway. Ill never buy another modern truck. Even if I were pulling a skid steer every day id buy an old f series with a 460, or something along those lines. The planned obsolescence on new trucks is really just disgusting
I owned a 2005 F250 4x4 regular cab long bed w/ the 6.0 POWERSTROKE  The old guy has the right idea. Sorry modern truck bros.
"I can spit my copenhagen thru there" 😂
I'm  a classic a classic truck owner through and through.
I ll take the old classic Ford pickups any day over the new overpriced computerized technoloical bullshit that Ford is making today... overpriced garbage
Stock tires, stock wheels, mostly stock 1994 Dodge Ram, and mostly rigged parts to keep it looking stock. My grandpa would be proud keeping it alive, 'course he and grandma still alive, bless their souls. 😊❤🙏
Bet i can service the air cleaner on the rust bucket without loosing a finger,unlike the f 350
Old Man won that round..
I relate to this old guy so much, thats me trynna get in my truck everyday😂
I’m with the old geyser I prefer the old Truck
both, both is good
I'll take that old girl over that new shit any day
Those wheels are clean asf
😅
I’ll take a k5 blazer anyday. Top off All day long
Wing windows are air conditioning
^^ how he nearly fall out of the truck... XD 😉🥳🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀
Old truck guy got one hell of a rack Drove a old 250 years back, that's two 50's less than the new truck. It was neglected by the previous owners and I had to put a tonne of work into it, but she never failed me.
The classic truck owner has a good point when he said that his truck was built when America was truly AMERICA
I've never seen an old man get out of a lifted truck. They're all always stock.
that old ford is a beauty
My neighbors arguing while I garden organic veggies
It runs and has big ass wheels bet those windows and radio are all roll down
Billy moves like a squirrel until squirrel situations are required
OLD TRUCKS FOREVER!!! HECK YEAH!!!!!
Now I caint put my mind on which better truck I won't to have.  I dang sure like the ventilation hole , but I needs the AR conditionin of that 350 Powder Stroke.  But I cant have the risk of russians hackin  my computer carberator.  I am a shorty so I need to compenstate with a Big Truck if I can jump that high to get in it.  I must say thank you for demonstrating the pros and cons of these trucks so that either way I could be makin the wrong selection.
You really need to switch to decaf.
One thing about older models: they sound better with gas engines and are A LOT easier to work on. Newer vehicles. So much technology in the truck. And heavier
TRUCK GANG!
You wuanna knuow something? My truck is nout as popula as your truuck is. My truck turnss eyes. Yours does nuot! 😂
I swear modern trucks even if u get mud tires i bet itll still get stuck on the most basic mud
I like both.
clicked because of the thumbnail. That dentside is a beaut.
1:32 haha
they are both right,  and neither is wrong.
Truck is truck. (not for snowflake ridgelines lol)
I want that old truck
damn, i want that bronco
"I got a winder"
Someone tell Ginger Billy to do a R Kelly skit with his bbc friend. That would be hilarious.  Good work sir. Enjoy your work. I want to join that truck gang. I haven’t joined anything cool since the Navy.
Him trying to get into that big truck is me whenever I was younger trying to get into my dad Truck
Nice old Ford GB !  Dog is pretty sweet to.
Man I like the old truck guy more
Mine says 3000
My 84 long bed Yoder beat the brakes off every jeep trail.. never broke a tail light with the 500 lb half inch thick steel custom rear bumper. Yanked more broke Chevies out more mud your strange cousin could choke on. We did have to trailer it on the 4 hauler because that dumb* couldn't do more than 40 mph😂
Got a 94 k3500 dually 6.5 turbo I'll never get a new truck
Did you get those wheels from snoop diggidy dog
Wow that truck looks exactly like my 75 f250 that I had about 35 years ago. It was a factory high boy with a 6-in lift kit 38 1/2 inch gumbo monster mudders. It had a 351 Cleveland world over to a 396. It was even the same color as that one
"Here's my airre "
I like both of them honestly. They got pros and cons
My grandpa is a hardy
"...you can park it under my truck."
I’ve been wanting a 79 Ford liked it for many years
I would rather drive the old Ford
I love Ginger Billy so much he's one of the best YouTubers ever
RIMS
Mine is a 16 Inch lift
Chevrolet silverado durumax roling coal 15 inch lift and mud boggers
That was cool 😎
We need a tour of all his trucks
2000s truck owners: look at thise idiots fighting im superior. Also there truck (most medium size a truck can be)
Am3ric4s obsession with pick up trucks really is tragic.
great..... after watching this dude's videos for a couple of times I get Trump asking me for donations. LOL. AI at its best.
Old truck all the way. Lol..
When you get a new truck the trick is keeping your old rust bucket around for when the new one is in the shop that way no down time 👍
I just love that “Truck Gang” action going on at the end of every truck related meeting/confrontation! Classic! LOL
Am I the only one thinking what truck I would rather have the f350 my dream truck but again the big block older truck is fine to I'll have a hard time to decide witch one I would pick
Hang on there cowboy! Those big tires could eat ya alive.
You will talk different when that diesel needs a 5000.00 tune up!
very funny
Those wheels coast more than your whole truck 💀💀💀. Im a real man don't need all that fancy stuff😂😂😂
If it's run by computers it ain't a real diesel
New Truck Guy: My rims cost more than your truck! Old Truck Guy: At least I own my truck, not the bank!
It’s all fun in games when the little kid comes with his toy truck .
Ones for towing long distances and the other is for fun/bugout. You really need both.
7.3L IDI for the win, Truck Gang!
That is a nice old truck
Haha man your the best at these videos. Love em .   Dodge the father  Ram the daughter TRUCK GANG
We will all get the Russian hacker joke very shortly
I can't lie I'm team old truck...the new trucks have too much silly shit a real truck guy don't need
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Omg can I have that ford.My late husband had his for 26 years.God if I had old green now😢😢😢😢
This is too real😂
Them 73-79 Ford Dentsides are some of the sexiest trucks in existence! 🔥
Going to the Hardee’s to drink coffee 😂
" you can park it under my truck" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love the dentsides   i have a laye year 78 bronco. I got lucky cuz they had allready started putting the high pinion dana 44 in. It.  Mine was in the first 400 to have the updayed dana 44 ,  im working on it now  the engi e dynoed  at 495 hp. 351 wi dsor but they have a weak backbone  crank issues and if u go ober 4 grand it could detonate.  I am thinking about a 460 but ill keep the numbers matching engine.   That truck is badass
Well, the new Fords can be optioned out with the 7.3 (450) engine for their Super Duty lineup! That engine would kill this debate rather quickly!
That 6.7 Powerstroke would totally crush that 429
f 450 cringe
I have a 74 dodge powerwagon and its a million times better than any new pavement pounder on out there.  I also have ventilation in the floor. Lol
old trucks still better
2:40 freaking hilarious 😂
I be drinking the Juice. Js ! lol
I like the square body a lot better
I would love to see some outtakes and behind the scenes clips. There is no way he does all that comedy skit in 1 take.
I'll take the 429
then the f350 gets stuck and has to get pulled by the "rust Bucket"
That’s why I refuse to sell my 95 dodge 12valve. I don’t give 2 shits if the dash is cracked and the clear coat is missing from 1/2 the truck. I bet it starts and drives 20 years from now without costing  anything besides a jump box or a push down a hill.
I'd much rather have the older one
Love the 79 Ford F150 No one ever built a better looking pickup. I also think that 79 was the last year of the really good trucks, by anyone. I just picked up this piece of information. A new dually pick up weights more than a Sherman tank.
This is some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever seen 😂
Copenhagen. 😂😂😂Scoal bandits.
Neither one of these are "trucks", they're toy cars brought to life. Why do all american cars look like they were designed by an 8 year old? Like, what is even the purpose of these cars? They are big, but they don't seem to get any more use out of their size than much smaller cars. They are bulky, frivolous, childish toys.
Ill drive that old truck any day,,, these computers and all the extras are nice,,,its just so much harder to find the problem with power everywhere and heated seats
And this is why I sold my Dodge Ram years ago and now drive an ‘07 Kia Rio. Nobody wants it which is why nobody would steal it and millennials can’t drive manuals anyway, it cost almost nothing and if it blows up today I’ll buy another one tomorrow, it gets 35 MPG and costs almost nothing to maintain, it’s got no computers in it and I can do most of the maintenance myself.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My soon to be 49yo a$$ has really come to appreciate them heated seats and i love remote start😂 the old square bodies and dentsides will always hold a special place with me😊
😂 Viagra And Pool Table LMFAO Go Ginger Billy Absolutely the funniest man I've ever watched on the internet. I would love, love, love to go to one of his concerts it would be the bomb ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I would take the old Ford over the new one any day!!
"you can park it under my truck" lolzzzzzzzzzzzzz
OLD TRUCK FTW
classic truck guy boasts how much bigger his engine is, but his big block only has a third of a liter more displacement lol
That f350 is awesome but I want the old big truck.
Still coming back every now and then to this video. Still hilarious😂
The old will always be better since they break down less often
This here says f3fity...
Ford... 💀 And that's all I have to say.
where u rent them trucks from?   best part was the dog
My dad has 48 inch weeks with a custom lift
Cels on the old one?   No?  Ok sold!
Drew a picture of you how do I send it to you
As a 1978 owner I can confirm this is how your average conversation is.
Every guy I went to high school with :D
When I was 15 years old I wanted my grandpa's 95 ram 2500. It has a 5 speed manual, crank windows, and the little ol 318 magnum in it. My mom was trying to convince me to not take that truck and she asked me if I was sure I wanted it and I replied with "unless you can find me something older." She never bothered me about it again and I'm glad I got that truck because being 16 to 17 years old right now I've been putting it through hell and it is surviving. Needless to say I'm a classic truck guy
Them: Arguing over who's toy is better Me in the corner with a 6500 Silverado: ha ha welder and pipe go brrr
Truck gang
He's climbing in that truck like I get in one. I'm paralyzed from the chest down, lol.
New diesel pickup about $100k. We bought my 78 k10 pick out der for $500 usd
Im in texas
I’ll take a lifted old truck any day over a soy boy truck of today 😜
The,  "TRUCK GANG" Has me lmfao
I have they same exact Fuel Wheels "Blitz" LOL
460 Aircon. Four winders down, 60 mph.
Edna approves of this message
My A/C is old school.... 2 windows down, 45 mph.   💚
Love the old ford
You shoulda seen her dad looking like a weasel driving around . Hahahaha I’m serious man , you were never on shit .
Boy I got one 9 inch lift on 40s 460 big block the only thing it’s good for is burning gas lol anyone wanna buy it???
REDNECKINIZE❤❤❤
I just came to say truck gang
Id take that old school every day of the week. .keep your pansy truck
F O R D !
Murica!!!
At least there both fords
I like both of these trucks 😂. And I agree with both 😂
Where's the old Toyota Hilux pickup at. They'll be held together with bondo and duct tape and have 400k on them and still be running great.  Foreign truck or not, I'll take one of them over an old F150 anyday.
Love that old truck
Life Alert........lol.
Sad part of this is 99.9% of the hillbillies in the country actually believe Russians want to hack into your trucks ECU’s. Lmao.  This dude is hilarious. That dude getting in that ridiculous truck at the end had me lmao
the new trucks are so cutting edge and gorgeous…. but that OBS is just 🫦🫦
Ol school is the best school. comming from a 21 year old.
Probably a few fell drunk from that one.😂
Ginger Billy for President.  Make Murica funny again.
I vote for the old truck
Or just get a idi 6.2 Detroit diesel or 12 Cummins no electrican 🐂 shit boys
"These were made specifically made for off-road purposes, your little wheels was made to go through the mall parkin' lot" 🤣
I love the old truck. I miss mine
Can't beat the ol stuff
I would definitely go for the older model in a heartbeat
I love my old trucks.. when my pretty friends brand-new shinny bicycles tear up they have to wait weeks if not months for their module or computer chip to come from China.. my old trucks don't need that but just a wrench and a screw driver.. besides if Russia ever drops a dirty bomb all these pretty little lectric vehicles never going to.. mine will tho
At the end of the day they're both walking or Riding shotgun with tow driver .
So basically you’re damned to be called a city slicker/pavement warrior if you have a newer truck, and you’re an ultra patriot tinfoil hat redneck that belittles everyone else if you have an older truck. Noted. Joke aside, I’ve dealt with that myself. I have a 10 year old truck that I use for work but keep fairly clean and was scolded at the local Walmart by a guy with an old lifted k-10 for buying some expensive fancy truck that seemingly never leaves the pavement. Of course it don’t. I pull a trailer. Unlike him I need not a 12” drop hitch to do so. Just drive your truck, enjoy it, and let everyone else live their lives.
Everyone can agree the newer ones are more comfortable however the old ones or more durable they don't break down is easy cuz back in the day things were made that last cuz America was broke as f🦆ck
😂that "fuel wheels " shimmy
New trucks are definitely more comfortable but, them old trucks are so cool.
F tier comedy
I’m not American, but it is so funny)
As I was scrolling past had to check twice to make sure it wasn't whistlingdiesel
I love how they talk the same way
Shining example of why a step bar is necessary on a raised truck
Чуть что и во всём сразу виноваты русские хаккеры))😂
People who drink Yeoungling drive the old rigs. The people who drink bud light drive the newer rigs.
oh man u so funny
Man that lope is sweet…
😂💪🍺
I fuckin lost it at the dip spit toilet in the old man's truck! LMAO truck gang
I owned a Dodge Ram 1500 5.7 HEMI 2013 DAMN you know you are the king of the road 😂
i'll take the old truck anyday
(:
Hilarious
Too bad most people who drive modern trucks rarely leave the suburbs and the city. Bunch of status obsessed douches.
one of those trucks is worth more then every trailer in the park, the other has wheels that are more valuable then the truck
The reality is these newer trucks have more power and get better gas mileage.  It's tough to drive a 6 mpg 1970 F-250 high boy nowadays and they shake if you go over 55 mph.  Not to mention it is tough to find parts for older vehicles nowadays.
Sorry, i like old truck more, especially when those electric  vacuum cleaners called cars around🤣🤣
Miss those days of 60 mph and the windows down natural a/c
He’s not totally exaggerating how most people get in and out of those old trucks. The only times I’ve seen people not look like they’re in a Benny Hill movie they were dropping more Fs and MFs than a Tarantino movie.
I dont even have a truck but this made me laugh. Thank you for the upload.
Not gonna lie, i like that old ford -__-.
Ginger Billy Limes To Suck The 3ock
Truck Cuck in Cuck Trucks
Thank you for posting this.  I was thinking that the room acoustics were bad, until he started singing.  Turned out great
At least there both fords
how long has linus been winning ? id bet on him he cant lose
I ain't gonna lie to ya, I'd drive that old Ford til the axles fell off it.
As the proud owner and regular driver of a lifted '95 Suburban I must say that old man has some good points.  Especially 'bout them rushin' hakers.
They’re both nice and all, but they haven’t met the superior opponent which is the crossbreed of a truck and an SUV, the Hummer
Why does the old guy have boobs?
Don't need a second mortgage for an old truck lol
that old dent side is sweet.
Did anyone notice the new truck guy drove away without his dog, the dog was chasing after him.
Them's some tignol biddies😂😂😂😂
Russian hacking into my truck Im dead 🤣
I can't respect any truck owner with heated seats... since they clearly forgot that the heats in the tools!
What's really funny is that their driving the two best trucks made in history and arguing about it!
that brand new f350 WILL NOT be around in 20-30 years all the electric motor stuff will stop working the AC will have needed 3-5 new compressors since its a modern ford and eventually it will just break down and be so expensive to fix that getting a new one is cheaper and thats all by design i give it 10 years MAX
love u my man keep it up all the best 2 ya
Love them square bodies!
Just love this man
At least it ain't a Honda vagline
Что то что то дурилки картонные так что успакойтесь ребята
Do you guys speak English?
As far as i can tell, carburetors have 0 advantages over FI.  Am i wrong?
that old truck is very cool
why the hell does your dentside have 6 bolt rims!!!!!?????
Yah ginger Billy I realized it a fat dope head  douch
Hahahahah this was good
My old man told me "if they're driving it, it's a ford. If they're working on it, it's a Chevy" Thought I'd start a war round here with a nugget of Alabama wisdom
"Keep my wheels out your fucking mouth!"
If it starts to rain you can park your truck under Mine !
It don't really matter what the year is that these cars are supposed to be cars and trucks not spaceships we're supposed to have fun and go back and forth to the grocery store we're not going out into space we don't need chips in our damn cars is almost a joke
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Now the fat guy is driving the Dezer. But last time he was driving the power stroke
I agree with the old truck owner....
That old ford looks awesome with those super swampers
Call me crazy but I’ll take the old F1nuttin over the new fancy smancy
I don't care how much a person is down & depressed after watching their episodes; you can't help from busting on the floor.  Ginger Billy and family, thank you for bringing laughter.
I love my 55 step side still have the factory boards in the bed
My truck came with a revolver and a bottle of moonshine . Thanks GM 😂
When he said “Them Russians” I lost my mind
Rustbucket my ass that thing is sexy
Flip down the driver sun visor, if it has a mirror in it it's a girl's truck
Шо то хуйня, шо это хуйня!
$100k for a truck is stupid.  Give me the old truck every day of week
Whistlindiesel 2
Ventilation hole 😂
At least the older one will still last longer then the newer ones will anyway of the week
I'll take both if ya wouldn't mind.
That old truck looks good, I might be a closeted redneck... 😅
As a man who still owns the 71 f100 390 truck I learned how to drive in, a 78 lifted f150 With the 460 out of my grandmothers LTD that I dated my wife in, and a 97 f350 crew cab dually I raised all 3 of my kids in, I regularly have the above argument with myself. I can honestly say I see both sides. 😂 but I have come to accept that they all have a place in my barn. 🥸
I'm a classic truck owner. I have one and it is a beast. With 600 horsepers it could beat any demon on the road out there. Now if you going to come asnd tell me that my truck looks like a crossbred between a weedwacker and a hearse, I will leave you in the fine dust.
Только что хакнул F350!
Even me I have Ford but a toy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hell, man. I have a Cherokee XJ, and this still hits home.
Imagine being his neighbor lol
dang man.. you left out the wing windows!!!
Expensive things I'll never be able to afford!
Lmfao,great video 😂😂
I was waiting for him to use my grandpa's one liner when he rolled the window down. "You see that right there?! That's the brand new 250 air conditioner!...2 windows down, 50 mph."
Meanwhile I just want a small Toyota pickup as a daily
Hahahahahahahaha 🥳🤣😂😁😃🤣😂
tbh i would want the "Classic" truck
Neither of them actually​ uses there truck to carry anything...
Good benefits to either or but I'm more of new truck model 🤣
Can confirm, I am Russian hacker hacking your truck right now
I love how they move like characters from an early rockstar game
Dude them 44s on 15s got me in the feels. That's how ya do it right there! Love the channel brother
Another video where a white person makes a complete fool of themselves.  All the commercials now portray a white person as  stupid and you help the cause.  You don't have to act stupid  to get attention.
Lol I’ve got both. Multiple new trucks for my business and then multiple old trucks that I drive all weekend/every chance I get. Best of both worlds and it’s all relatable.   I don’t need to know how to work on new trucks… because they don’t need working on. But enjoy restoring my old ones and proud of the work when I get done. As well as enjoy cruising around in them and forgetting about how fast the world is spinning around me..
As a diesel mechanic, I HATE working on 6.7 powerstrokes. 7.3 and 6.0 are the easiest to work on. And just stay the hell away from a 6.4
Snapper lawn mower 😂😂😂😂 hit your life alert 😂😂😂😂
Left my m************ ass off you are one funny dude I love your comedy skits the last one I watched my face hurt for a half a week
my back hurts looking at those wheels
You sir got a new subscriber.
I'll take old school all day everyday.
these are one massive tires
🛻☀
After watching Ginger Billy I think I finally get America's obsession with big trucks.  Truck gang!
That little dog chasing you is too fast 😂
Rather have the high boy
This reminds me of me. I daily a 85 c10 🤣🤣 I love it
Truck Gang Decal... Would you make these in BLACK please.
For such a little man he has a lot of really tall trucks.
Hahaha to bad them heated seats don't melt all these snow balls now ahhdays. Merica!Mexican!! Let me be free.
Man it’s them electric steps bro 😂 I love them on 38’s
Ahhhhh the South.. 😂😂
😂 I hate running boards only installed them for the wife
New trucks may be comfy but an old truck that isn't beat to hell is comfy to
You boys show is funny as heil
New trucks are like an Nintendo with wheels and a lot of environmental shit under the hood and on the exhaust line.
I love my modern tundra but I still love the late 50’s Chevy trucks.
Lol... you are funny lil ginger... 🏁
Me: *rolls up with a hilux that has a anti air gun mounted in the bed*
You forgot to say his payments are 799 a month for 120 months on that new truck
"PARK IT UNDER MY TRUCK.!! 😂 😁👍
One major problem they both ford's
California wants to start regulating how much you drive and talking about shutting down your vehicle through the computer.....    old truck wins again
Shit...I'm totally the geezer... With my 5.9 12v, I don't even need a battery to run it... I do need a battery to turn it off, though.
Rip puppy for running under them nail polish tires
I'd still take the class of truck over the newer one, I hate electronics. You drive through one little puddle and the thing shuts off for like the 15th time or it goes into limp mode. One of the reasons why I don't buy Chevy no more. Infuriating!
Buy a 1992 F250 with the 460 and manual transmission and get the best of both worlds
I miss my Dodge Dakota. I know it's not as cool... but it's Midwest Duck Hunter package. Coffee stains. Duck calls and mud.   TRUCK Gang!
Team classic
O,my I had wisps of long ago memories Being 16 and sitting right next to my boy friend... (I'm going  to be 70 in July)
That high and tight beer belly is so accurate😂
Plot twist: hes both
I would rather have an old car any days in a new car
Ginger Billy you're the man lol
Did I just c u run over your dog?.
An average speed is 25 mph to assist in the air conditioning  a milk crate to assist the enter,exit situation and one has a perfect truck
Old man b like Trojan,  more rubber than rim.
that old clunker is absolutely gorgeous, you can keep that fancy pancy f-series, i'd do bad bad things for a set of them wheels👌👌👌
“I’m almost in there”
We all know the classics are better. Don’t need any foo foo fluffy computers and such and you can get an ac conversion kit if the ac doesn’t work in it. Plus if something somehow breaks it’s not $1500 to fix it
He sounds like gta NPCs
I wish we got super duty trucks here in South Africa. But at the same time we get the Hilux and a bunch of other stuff the US misses out on. I mean we have a whole Ford factory in Pretoria that will do an RTR conversion for you on your Mustang. What's stopping them from making the F series? Seriously asking.  I would like to know
Love your videos brother! Nice Ford by the way!!!Not the new one,lol...That early F-250!...
By far one of your best videos 😂
Me, a computer engineer: yeah and I actually KNOW what all those computers do!
Got crank windows on my 04 Silverado extended cab 250k on the truck 4.8 engine with 4l60e trans still kicking haha like a horse at times 😂 love my cateye last gen GM made decent
Not gonna lie, that old Ford is pretty cool. I'd need a step ladder to get up there, though 😅
Looks like Old Billy had a boob job! WHUT YOU TRYINA TO SAY OLD BILLY?!
u so funny man
I have an 09 F350.. love the old ones...used to have a 77 F250.  Love your videos
HAHAHA Sweet vid!
I drive an ‘89 Sierra 1500. Fanciest things on it are the EFI 350 and the power windows lol No way I’m gonna ever own a truck newer than 97
boy that thing is purdy
I’d take the old one anyway of the week
Window, with an "R" @2:59 "I got a win-der" LMFAO
💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💪💯
I need about freefiddy - said loch ness monster.
Hahaha team old truck all the way 🤟
I want to do that lift and ties on my 1991 f150
1978 ford f150
😂😂😂
Almost forgot this is just one guy roasting himself and promoting 2 of his trucks 😂
I have a older truck that is nice to work on it. The new trucks cost too much alone and too much to fix for how often they break
If more people were content driving that old truck, they’d have a lot more money in their pockets.
how did he do this with zero cursing?
I had the same ventilation hole in the floor of my 1979 Datsun pick up
Watching this with 1.75x hits different
Я из россии и я хакну оба ваших грузовика
So is the elcamino in the truck gang
As someone who has a classic truck built almost exactly like the one in this video just smaller tires but the same size rims and same lift I think I love this.
first video that i watch in 2023
Hahaha the end is great your funny man 😂
6.7 power stroke funny thing is that those engines are fucking shit
0:28  happened to me once
That 429 dont got nothing on my old campers 454 gas v8 and not many miles
Lol
Old truck is great, love the sound.
Classic truck gang
"i dont need no AC, i got a winder!"
"A PoWeRsTrOkE huh?"**continues to won a powerstroke**
Old truck are tougher and steel not plastic new trucks is electronic plastic garbage which both of them are Fords so they're both garbage lmao
And then theres the one guy with his datsun 620 thats hauls more shit than both of them combined 😂
It'd be cool if companies sold old-school trucks with only a few new amenities. Mainly good AC, comfy seats, remote locks and a quieter cabin. That's all the tech to need in a truck. The rest would be modern engines and simple, old-school, easy to fix design.  If they could built a bulletproof truck like that, it would top best-selling lists for years
Old is always better than  New
Hear the whistle see the smoke you just blew up your powerstroke
Drink coffee at the Hardees was the most real thing. The county I grew up in has a tiny farm town as the county seat and all the old timers meet at the Hardees for breakfast religiously
was waiting for the Festiva to make an appearance.
Kei trucks are cooler than all of these and more useful and fuel efficient. I said it.
Life alert!
I’ll take the old truck any day…lol
The classic truck guy does have a good point about newer vehicles relying more and more on computers and electronics. A emp blast would completely fry modern day vehicles.
Yeah but stock height f100 beats anything else.
I rather own a square body simply because of how easy it is to work on
Cute little engines they got there.  My 72 Ford had a 460.
i bet somebody already ask this question but WHO is letting this man borrow they truck and talking trash about them
Ummm. I want both trucks 🤩🤘
I bet the ole timer was from HARDEEVILLE SC!
Then you get the British landowners with a truck "just do your bloody jobs, the land won't till itself!"
I’d love to have that old ford on 44’s
If russians can't hack it, ginger billy'll back it😆😆😆
When yer truck gotta Handel that yeh use to pull yer ass up in that hahh sumana biatch and over theh yehhs the damn thang literally pulls outa the slots cause it took your ass pulling yourself up in it everyday.    My old dawge.    Drivers side handle to pull yourself inside. Yep. Had to drill a self tapper screw to keep it in so it’ll never fall out the original bolt broke through the plastic so I drilled it in. No damage it fixed.    Yea boah
Those little rims with all that tread on them is just fricken awesome. You got sidewall all ight boah
Hilarious.  Would love to meet him in person, if he talked like that with a vehicle I'd piss myself laughing so hard. It's Hilarious seeing him trying to get back in his pickup lol😁😁
The new truck is nice but HIGH BOY  is the THE HIGH BOY you cant win that
0:50 That's a nice rack 😄
Dude is just a national treasure! 🤣
Yo man your a sick puppie...I love it  👍
I have a 96 f250! I love my 4.9!
I would be scared that the dog would run between the wheels! 😱 But I am always very overprotective when it comes to my dogs.. 😅😂🤦🏼‍♂️
I'm 58 and drive a ford with a 6" lift and 33 inch tires. I'm about to trade it in on a low rider LOL
So I'm kinda not very rich, wanna make me a deal I can't refuse on poop stain there? Things bad 😎
That truck was made when AMERICA WAS AMERICA 🇺🇸
You can park it UNDER my truck!!!!!
I want the older truck
Glad theirs air conditioning because leather is sh*t😮
I'd take the 70s model every time..
That's how big tires are supposed to look, 15"-16" wheels 33-44in tires , you can't do shit with those giant wheels and thin ass tires, it just looks stupid
Nice truck billy Ford F-350 super duty and truck so ugly your truck Ford F-350 super duty better
I actually like classics tbh but love your videos man
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I can spit my Copenhagen through there 🤣🤣🤣
When he was trying to get in that truck reminded me of one my brother had lol I used to have to get a step stool to get into it I am only 5 ft 3 lol those where great times back then
That's a beautiful ol ford!!
Eh, it starts to grow on ya after a bit.
If this guy and buddy brown got together…. They’d have the entire Bible Belt in stitches
I think I’m with the classic truck guy
I always thought turning the A/C on was opening the side glass to let in more air.
I went to college driving a '69 Ford truck. When we sold the farm in 2018 it was still running. No side mirrors or tailgate but they drove it out of the pasture into town in a righteous cloud of blue smoke.
"Those are made to go through the mall parking lot" hahaha had me dieing
Bow tie powerstroke
Truck gain
YES they will you it as a weapon of destruction you better watch out for them RUSSIANS🤣😂                                                       just kiding for all them RUSSIANS OUT THERE!
Seeing that old 78 makes me miss mine love to get another someday
i like both trucks
Yea!
4.19
"that truck was made when Ameuricuh was Ameuricuh"... Billy is a 💎!
The real joke is that they're both Ford owners
If it's raining and you don't wanna get your little truck wet, you can park it under mine! Lmfao!
This dude is great!!! 🤣🤣🤣So glad it was in my recommendations... I will now Subscribe!!!
The Fall Guy Truck is the coolest, if any one knows who The Fall Guy is ? Or was ? 😂
You have to be from TN. or GA.  Either that or you are good at faking our accent. Lol. I used to travel a lot doing construction work, and disaster relief. I could go into a bar up north and drink all night without having to pay for my drinks. Strangers would keep buying me drinks just to hear me talk.
Ain’t lien bout the computers though
I'll always take the classic especially if a 73-79. Plus the classic owner isn't paying a note plus interest. Only complaints a 429 and rust should have put a 300 in it.
That old truck is bad ass!! I mean so is the 350 I guess...
Well its not a DURAMAX so
Up until about 5yrs ago i used to own a toyota hilux pickup 2001 🇬🇧 model (the one that the programne top gear couldnt kill in the programme) its now 21 years old and still on the road i spent about £3000 in total on parts for it as it did belong to a farmer (had to sell it as couldnt afford it anymore ) was very nice to drive. Hardly had to clean it as was white so took along time before looked dirty  🤣🤣
I want the old Ford truck
Bro the park it under my truck killed me
Wow that old gal was gutless by the looks of it
😂😂😂😂😂
1:33 Snoop Diggity dogg lol 😂😂😂
This is so funny 😁
There is no question on what a man would pick. It's obvious that a REAL man would pick the classic.
Yeah give me the classic it's more beautiful than that new truck with all that unnecessary additions I drive a 1989's Dodge RAM she's a beast on dirt road and on drag track but good luck getting me to tell you what heart beat I gave her #TruckGang
Love your Channel Billy keep em cumin'.
I live in New Zealand hillbilly red bald head, can you hook me up with a yank tank 👊😎
My truck is a classic truck he thinks his truck is better cause it’s new truck well my truck is   A 2002 Ford Explorer sport track
You can park it under my truck baby boy!! Go get yo poncho hun.
Honestly I think all truck builds are cool AS LONG AS THEYRE NOT SQUATTED
I'll take the '70s
I agree with the old man
That 70s model truck is cool as it gets
This is literally every neighbor I have here in bama
They really are feminizing our vehicles. I'm only 30 but mark my words the more pampered we alow ourselves to be the weaker we will become. Heated seats and steering wheels, big diesel computer lol with pretty wheels.
Rolls down window “I got a winder” 😭😭😭😭
Um ... you still working in the hospital?
I’ll take the one with the rust hole in the floor
Lol, I have both old and new trucks. Lifted and lowered. I feel it either way. Either have to get the ladder or just fall in. All trucks have their place. I'll be a truck guy as long as I live.
^^
Where is he getting all these trucks
true chads drive classics
Classic Trucks all the way
He has a winder. 😂💕
Im classic truck gang
💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ‘70s Ford F-250s are good trucks
My dad's favorite joke about his old blue Ford truck was "There's no recycled metal in this beast." My Grandpa also had an old Ford truck as well and the joke with it was "It'll take a fuel tank of gas to crank it but it'll pull your house down." lol When I drove up in my 1991 stepside Silverado all I heard was "the damn family is going to hell!" They respect my truck a bit better though since It survived me as a 16 year old and I still have it 17 years later  <3
Both truck are nice old school an new school I need to get me another truck LOLOLOLOL 😆
Nobody gonna talk about how his dentside has 6 LUG WHEELS?
That truck was built when America was still America... Classic
Will take an old truck anytime.... specially one that looks like that old Ford.
Bad ass 79 , I’ve got a 79 Ranger XLT I wouldn’t swap it  for a any brand new trucks no way no way , 79 are one of the coolest trucks ever , the mother of the monster truck culture!
Can I buy your 79? Seriously can I buy it, I’ll trade ya ma’ fancy Hilton model Ram 1500
Oh god he has the fuel rims 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Truck gang!!!!
TRUCK GANG!!!
My first truck is a 1986 stepside GMC sierra grande, and I am hell proud of it
Any level lift kit
He who dies with the most toys is still dead.
Fords are trash and Chevy is the best
im a classic truck guy myself
Truck gang is the best
i can't tell if the accent is on purpose or not i can't tell if the jokes are on purpose becuase if they are i would have a millions of bloopers if i was you
Where can I get a lift that big for a 95 f150
winner truck owner
Shits too funny 😂
I mean, the classic truck guy was way more convincing, jussayin'. His comebacks were on point.
I have 1978 F150 dent side that I love. but I also have 1981 F250 bullnose 4x4. with a 300c.i. 4.9L inline six and a four speed that is bulletproof. those were probably the toughest truck ever made. but I really love that 79 that Ginger Billy has in this video. that truck is no doubt BAD ASS. even if I would have to keep a step ladder handy.
I like dem old trucks
Duramax rules
In full honesty, there was a case of someone buying a 2017 or 2018 jeep cherokee and a hacker turned her car remotely, while she was driving on the interstate
How could you not love this! lmao 🤣
Is that classic truck urs too?
1st gen event https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j54PJhTXCw4&lc=Ugw6MBx7wgNwrggtPwV4AaABAg.9dAErlzijT-9dFSdJJS0vU&ab_channel=OvensGarage
Truck Gang 👆🏼👈
260 air 2 windows down 60 miles per hour ! Lol
When the video ended the ad was for an escape with park assist hahahaha, pathetic just pathetic where we are headed
The two different sides of the truck  community in a nutshell
We don't have many Hardees. What should I do....?
I'd take that '78 all day
Him getting into the truck lol
I prefer the older truck
The best part about the heated seats is if your back hurts.
Can you do a video on that old Ford?
How many vehicles do you own ? You have a bunch of super dootys, a teslar siber truck and now a Ford big block. I'm jealous
Old trucks rock ! :D
personally love older trucks compared to new ones yet i dont know why
I prefer classic trucks over any fancy truck
Awesome video I prefer 1980-98 chevy trucks over Fords anyday 🤣🤣
Is that charners truck?
i gotta admit, i would find bigfoot jr more useful for traffic.
AND!… I can spit my Copenhagen through there.
The one climbing into the big truck looked like he had boobs!
Im a classic type of person
Yo but the Classic won’t break ever
Shoptruckgathering2022! Classic truck meet coming up! You should go! Be so cool to see you. I'm sure you get a ton of request. Todd Johnson is bringing the classics back in restoration.
Truck Gang!
that "I'ma go drink coffee at the Hardee's" is too accurate. I work at a local place similar to Hardee's. there's like 6 old guys that come in every afternoon to drink coffee and shoot the shit. it's great
15 inch wheels on 44 inch tires leaves a really nice tire profile. love the meaty look
that highboy is bad ass tho
Truck Gang 4 life lol
U in Kentucky?
The old geezer doesn't look so foolish now about those Russian hackers wanting to take over our trucks.
If your truck has heated seats or even worse, air conditioned seats....... I will always look at you as a fake and a wantabee tough guy.
Where he gets all them trucks from 🤣😂
Bottle of viagra and a walker ..a love story
What would I be considered since I drive an 06 f150
Me and my dad lol all day
Lol you make my day 😊
God Damn🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥
U r crazy 😂😧 bro love what you're doing keep up the good work and let me hear some feedback on you bro
It's kinda funny when u fall out of the truck
Lol
I want to see truck vs truck  on performance
Yep, truck culture. Anyone want to introduce rolling coal to these fine gentlemen?
Great video 👍👍
"you can park it under my truck." That's when I hit like...
Hell I die laughing when he make that one eye cross.
Hmmm  "was made when  America was America" hmmm wonder what that means.
Man that f150 is a beauty
The dog under th ram lol
Son these are 44 inch super swamper tires sitting on 15 inch Mickey Thompson wheels…. Legendary line
"Built in America when America was America"
"i can spit my copenhagen thru there" 😭😭😭
This was hilarious 😂
i anjoy my 1991 f350 supercab dually diesel and its fun!
Lmao !! Sad part, Old Ford will still outlast the F350 in ten years... !!  And will probably sell for a lot more !!
1:30
i like the old truck bedder
This is how boys do gossip. This truck was made when America was America, best line!
Classic owner wins!! 👑
3:46 watch your dog doesn't run under the trucks wheel
LoL  Russian hackers
just to day the supposed "lether" is acutely vinyl seating
"Why would Russian hackers want to hack my truck?"  I mean...why not? Have you seen RussianFPS?
That dog must have a nice life.
Drink coffee at the Hardee’s took me out 😂😂
CORPORATIONS SHOULD BE LINING UP TO PAY YOU FOR HOW EDUCATIONALLY ENTERTAINING YOUR SHOW IS TEACHING THIER PRODUCTS IN THE MANNER YOU DO IT IN. KEEPS THE AUDIENCE CAPTIVATED WHILE LEARNING AOBUT WHAT TO USE FOR WHATEVER REASON AND HOW TO USE IT...BILLY...YOU ARE AMAZING SIR
LOL...RUSSIAN HACKERS
Your videos are always a little slice of joy for me.
Truck gang
I luv this dude😂🤣   SUBSCRIBED!!
*russians hacking into my truck to make it a weapon* 🤣
Dear god hes a nut .lol gotta love the poor ole fella.
Old truck gang
Hahaha! Awe man, the video's over😞!
Honestly, I love the older truck by a country mile
Dont need all them fancy imenities lol as he struggles to get  back up n his 15inch lifted 79 ford 4X4 with 429 big block awesome
I like the older more
Old trucks are better imo
You need to come up with some kind of series like trailer park boys or smth man youre hilarious, really entertaining and funny 🤣 i love this dialect of US 😂
Did that truck come a case of ensures and a tv guidebook.?
When Amerrkah... was Amerrkah... 😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i think the old trucks still have any new truck beat any day
My back went out watching you dismount.
I'll take the old truck any day over the skin pealing leather seats that is too hot to spit on
Here is a video idea “squatted truck owner vs real truck owner” 😂
Love ol' Ginger Billy...I'll take that ol' Ford high roller anytime... 😎👍
where dose billy get all his clll toys
I need to work out again to get a body like that God dam!! No homo
You should buy a Chevy pick up
429? Mine's got a 460!
Yo thats a monster truck
Truck needs a bigger stall and prolly shorter gears
I’d still take the old truck 😂
As someone who’s grown up with the newer vehicles, I would still take the old F-100
Old truck anyday!!!
When Russia drops that emp everyone gonna be jealous of the ole rust buckets 😆 #conspiracytheory..maybe🤔
they dont make trucks like they used to
I have an old Ford f150 4x4 6"lift and a new truck. One day I was driving my old truck and an old man stopped me and said "Do you know the difference between and old truck and a new truck? The old truck still runs"
I enjoy good clean comedy, thanks for the smiles,
Ginger is awesome
This made me laugh so long this sounds like my friends 😂😂 don’t want them Russians hacking into your truck
That hole in the floorboard is good for disposing of your empty cans. Don’t wanna get caught with an open container!
We had 260 A/C, both winders down at 60 MPH!
Big boy lifted trucks for life
Yer both drunk.
Ain’t nothing better than that old truck door squeak💪🏼
New truck guy = me at 34 Old truck guy = me at 54 😜😜😜😜
I will take my unmolested d-250 with the 12v all day over both the modern f-350 (no bench seat and a mortgage payment) or the vintage ford on 44's... both are neat trucks though.
I feel like 4 eggs, protein shake and a 5hr energy shot is this guys regular morning just by his attitude 😂
Haaaaaaaa
My pappy has a 59 f100 wit at MONSTER 400! 79 SNOWFIGHTER 60 and sum 40's. and a CHROME GLOVE BOX DOOR😜
I bet if you sae the making of this video it would look like a schizophrenic episode
"I gawt a windurr"
Yall fancy pickemup truck
making a mockery of yourself dosent make it right.
this video is so bad
I'm fuckin dead 🤣
man that is one heck of a rust bucket. That thing so sick its straight evil! Absolute eye candy.
It might be inconvenient to have to hop out of the truck and lock my wheels to go into 4 wheel drive. But at least my 4 wheel drive still works. Same can't be said about my buddy's newer truck with its fancy 'auto locking wheel hubs'. All those sensors and vacuums, just more things that can fail.
I might be the odd  one out, but I honestly think those giant lifts are stupid. I'm happy with my little '02 Ranger. Does what I need her to do. She ain't a "new" model or a "classic" either. Just give the old girl some tlc and she's fairly happy.
It's all Detroit built to me 💪. Ain't nobody builds 'em like us 😎🎸
Lmao 😂 🤣 good video
Hey why does the old ford have 6 lug axles ?????
Let's just agree to disagree Ginger Billy. This resonates with me though, as I still drive my lifted '79 Jeep CJ.  Oh and bragging that your wheels cost more than the other guy's whole truck . . . that's the best one! LOL! That is about the most foolish thing you could possibly say.
Just wait til he sees my Hyundai Santa Cruz
aint no leather seats beat the good old bench seat
1:20 fast and furious vibes, when they caused the zombie car apocalypse hacking the can-bus
Looked like my climbing out of my xj on 40s lol I'm only 36 but damn it's a challenge with two bad hips
I wanna know where the "Old Truck" guy got my old F-250... I had a '79 Ford set up almost identical to that, except mine was a 460, 4spd manual, and it was white...
As a hardcore diesel guy and a hardcore GM guy, the 429 was hard to beat.
I'll take both of those trucks thank you.
I have had to help people into my rig I definitely more like the old fella 😂
Sad that you think that 350 is a real truck.. pavement princess. Go fet your hair and nails done.
both "beasts" are about 50 years behind the rest of automotive technology. one's a classic, the other is vintage.
Coffee at the Hardee's that is so true lmao
Ohh god I can’t stop🤣🤣
When he said "Russian hackers" I knew it was going to be good 😂
"Back when America was America!"  You guys understand why that was said by the old man, and the irony in many of you concurring with that statement, right? That truck is no younger than around the 70's-80's; it predates many reforms in laws and societal behavior that make this country more bearable for a wider range of people to live in.  Didn't realize I'd find an extra bit of comedy in the comments. Inb4, "Yeah, you!" gets thrown my way; try harder, chief.
Actually, both of those in my driveway would be heaven
Personally I'd pick the F350.  ...so I could sell it and buy ten of the good trucks.
That rust-bucket is my dream car-
Honestly for air.... nothing beats that front flip out window on the vintage truck.
It got personal for me when he said "you get dem wheels of ye snapper lawn mower?"
There aught to be a law against 4 door trucks. If you need 4 doors, buy a mini van or SUV
Lol 336 do you need any help
Lol
I miss my dentside.
I hate new trucks and where there headed , all the special buttons and heated seats,  pu$$ys , oh and dumb as hell for paying 80k for a truck  .... genius
Pulled up in a monster truck
Agree. That f350 is a.pos compared to that old American made truck
At least we can all agree the Honda Ridgeline sucks nuts
I love how American this is, love from 🇨🇦🇨🇦
both are beautiful trucks
🤣🤣🤣🤣 i still like the old one better
lol, as a classic truck owner, can confirm
Just classic truth! Great job Ginger Billy!
Wow. What are the odds that both of these guys would have the exact same tattoos.
F350 sounds small. F550 is were it at!
I'm with the old man on this one
I like the bark of that 429!
Guy is hilarious 😆
I miss my k30 silverado it was as big as the ford in this video
Why would anyone have heated seats?  My winters get down to -40’s. I’ve never needed a heated seat.  Would love cooled seats for the summers though. Anything over 65 and I’m more useless than a retarded and blind 2 legged donkey
44 inch super swampers on Mickey thompson wheels ! I must be the old man.  Becuase I dig them! Owned 2 sets of each over the years. At diffrent times
O 4 the luv of gawt this is ignurt 😬😱
He don't need no "conditioned airrre"...that stuff is for sissy's!  Personally...I'd take the "Fall Guy' truck over the 3fiddy any day. The F350 "beauty is a beast" like Gingy says but classics just have more character. Plus they're %100 made in Merica!
🤣😂🤣😂
I like a most old gen trucks and barely any new gen trucks
Truck gang.  I love it
Love that classic billy 😂😂
The sound of the classic ford tho
I'm in the classic truck category I own a 91 silverado and honestly love it best vehicle I've ever owned, all the repairs I've done on it have been done in the garage, never taken it to the shop once, currently restoring it piece by piece back to factory new.   Also the hand crank windows have never failed me... though I will say this the AC joke kinda hit hard because mine don't work so I actually do use window as the AC lmao.
Grandpa had a 1970 F-100 with an FE big block. Better than anything new!
Russian hackers sure didn't age well... XD
It’s 5am and I have to write a paper. Yet, I’m here.
This video sponsored by 5 Grams Of Booger Sugar!
I’ll take that oldie.  That’s bad ass. Lol
Step aside, please. I´ll take the rust bucket with Mickey´s and wings. Thank you...
the old truck is way cooler, and probably more reliable.
I admire the total commitment
Spending a ton of money for tires on a truck is stupid trucks are for working if you want a pretty fucking vehicle get a goddamn car
A pickup truck was intended for the blue color, affordable, and reliable transportation. These cowboy Cadillac are pretty, but way overpriced. 100k for a truck, thats ridiculous. Grab an old pickup and put a diesel in it. It’s paid for & you don’t need a computer science degree to fix when broken. More important, an old 30-40 0r 50 year old truck looks cool and you won’t have any depreciation vs. a cowboy Cadillac. Everything today looks so much similar in design and color. Black, gray, white, and silver = boring.
😂😂😂
I'll take the carburetor .
Weird flex but ok
Is there any video of that old girl playing in the mud??
😂😂👌🏼
Not gonna lie mike Thompson with super swampers thats class boy thats class
I love the video 😅 That old ford has either one too many lugnuts or two more are needed.
I'll take both of those with a smile!
Brilliant!
A big truck is no substitute for a personality.
You tell um ginger billy ,excellent!!
"8 mile" 's battle))))
Mickey Thompson’s are goats
Coke and steroids don't do drugs kids and don't buy ford's
One thing well can all agree on is people with those stupid squatted trucks shouldn't have a truck. It's like a dog squatting to take a shit. Same with those weirdos who put big rims and neon lights on their truck. Keep that crap in tuners where it belongs.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
👍😊
That truck was made when America was America!  # tag make Chevy Great Again!
I am fortunate enough to have the option for either. I love my 250 but cruise my F100 most of the time.
Karens truckers dammmmmnnnn😱😱😅🤣
Every time I see a lifted truck, I always think of Tie Fighters. Need special equipment to get in and out 😂
I’ve got bicycle rims bigger than them classic rims lmao
Snoop diggdy dog
I'd take them both. He'll yeah !
3:46
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
Lovin that old Ford pickup!
I'm not a truck guy but I can honestly say old trucks are way more badass and catch my eye in public. Which I can't say the same for new trucks even if they are modified they don't look that cool to me.
I almost forgot to sub!!! sooo funny
Funny video you just forgot the stereotypical I bang my cousin, Yeehaw!!!!!!
Should have ended it by saying each other’s truck is a pavement princess
Sorry to say but I'm 45 years old and would prefer the old Ford to the new Ford.  I'm a simple man. Would rather be able to work on my own truck then take it to dealer.
Both my dream trucks lol
That was funny as Effin- SHI*T!
Me and my dad
*rolls up in a Tesla Cybertruck* amateurs
That old school tho!!!!!!! Me like it
I'ma go drink coffee at the Hardee's LMFAO 🤣😂🤣
You listen and listen good boy. My truck was made when America was America
That big block does sound really good though. 🤣🍻
I like that bumpy stomach touch
I love how both of em stand and wobble around like toddlers XD
Hahahah so good!
My truck is a Stock 2004 Toyota Tacoma Pre runner V6. I love it.
Russian Hackers lol in your little fancy smancy truck
hilarious video lol... Id still rather have the old truck though.
I think his steroid use kind of draws away from the humor kind of like when carrot top got juiced out. The six-pack gut is a Telltale sign please take care of your health Ginger Billy
Bro, Mikey Thompson is WHEELED af
Billy what type of model is that jacked up truck
Idk about the real man stuff but I'm tired of electrical issues on my new trucks.. soo I bought a second Gen and a new caddy to drive around
Square body for life
I would never buy a new truck... Because I will be afraid to use it for work...
3:09 i wanna see the dog's truck
Me over in the corner with a 40 mpg Maverick like  “I don’t wanna hear y’all bitching about $5 gas if you choose to drive those monstrosities”
New trucks look like shit lifted fight me
You don't feel shame for driving a Ford when you have no soul to begin with.
I connect with the geezer.
The classic truck owner looked like he was in his 3rd Trimester.
I mean, the AC in those old trucks (when they're working) will freeze you out of the cab.
Perfect argument: my classic "rusty chum bucket truck" Won't fall apart the second my warranty expires, I don't need to go to overpriced mechanic workshops to get my truck fixed, because it isn't over engineered so I can do it on my own with duct tape and an hammer and some rusty wire, and my old rusty truck won't fall apart as soon I hit some offroad terrain and it looks wasteland style cool af, and because it's this old and dirty I don't have to worry that someone may steal it.
0:15 perfect advertisement shot for an Mad Max movie 😂
As a 50-year old who daily drives an Excursion on 38's (with no running boards or steps), I certainly felt the getting in and out of the old Ford sequences.
Air conditioning in my 1979 chevy full size manual tranny HD everything 4x4 was a plastic milk jug full of water ... me'n my best friend also stored a 12-pack beer behind the spare tire mounted in front of the grill.  Bought it new, the payments were $184.00/month, gas was $00.35/gallon, as a 19-year old carpenter I earned $9.00/hour ... damn sure had fun!
"Russians might hack into your truck ... and use it as a weapon  " They're not Muslims   😂
Its not the Russians you need to worry about. The cpu's in new vehicles track you where ever you go & they can be shut down from anywhere remotely in case you need to be "apprehended" for whatever reason.
Should’ve cranked the wind wing Everybody always asked me why they don’t make those anymore when they see them on my truck
Classic is definitely better
Both. Both are pathetic.

I'm retired now, but back in the day I wanted a truck like that old Ford so much!  Just didn't know the right people to get it built cheap, and I wanted to keep my day job.  My hunting buddies just climbed in and 'went', wherever and on demand.  No back corner of a distant field or shallow swamp was too for these ocean clippers of the field!
Gonna be no truck owners at this rate with gas prices
I felt that @ 1:27-1:31.
I didnt understand everything but old truck guy is right
It’s all fun and games until your eevsdropping neighbor brings out the monster truck. 😆
Dent sides 💦
I can relate.
He's right back in days trucks were truly american made but nowadays they are just Lego pieces from different countries
snoop diggity dog
Truth be told if the Old Ford wasn't lifted it would outlive the powerstroke with much less maintenance and repair costs.  Not that the lift is bad, it just tends to wear parts out faster lol
why does his fender have another fender?
i've got a 2011 f150 that is SCREAMING at me every DANG day that it needs a lift, but i fight it.  friggin 49, how much longer am i gonna be able to crawl into those tall trucks? :P
New trucks got computer brains that can be scramble and killed with simple ease. Censor gose out gonna cost you 1000 for cheap gas you put in to drive new rides 😆 just dept alone makes you a slave for payments.
I’ll take the bronze affair with the squeaky door please 😎👌🏻👍🏻
Bruh you drove your truck right next to your dog for me that pissed me off as a dog owner and lover that right their was irresponsible and unsafe for the dog like common people
You said f-350 wrong it’s pronounced EFFF TREEE FIDDY
even as an aussie, i reckon this is super funny!
The old ford heaters work better than the new ones.
1:26 fr tho lol
I like the old truck better myself. I used to own something in between.  A 1985 camper special truck it had a very luxurious interior for the time period, but it was a 1 ton with a 460 under the hood, it definitely still was a mean looking truck.
i love those tires on that old truck
"Why would Russian hackers want to hack my truck" -that aged well :)
Real men got cigarette vents on the front of them doors for AC lol
If you lol'd at "drink coffee at the Hardee's", you're alright.
I ain't never had that much trouble getting into my ol truck.
Actually hackers have hacked vehicles already,  at times with disastrous results.
Just came here to find out how to block this guy. Been trying to milk these tired ass truck videos for a minute. If you've seen one you've seen em all...
This guy can't see over the hood on either truck.  Damn funny.
Classic is much better
I swear he tells the future, when he said the Russian hacker thing it made me think of now Russia is probably actually gonna do it🤣🤣 putin done messed with tha wrong folks
the old truck looks a lot better though, have to say
Well that new ford MIGHT have heat... there working on a solution lol
He has to go to work because he has a 800 dollar truck payment and the other is going to do whatever he wants cause she's paid off.
I wish old trucks cost as much as a set of wheels.
😆😆😆😆
Shoot, you check CL or FB marketplace lately? That old Hooptie is worth more than the dually. I have been shopping for a truck for awhile now and even the old trucks people are asking 25-30k, freaking unbelievable.
Why doesn’t he have a f450
Haha, my very first truck was a brown '79 like that one.  Wasn't lifted or four wheel drive, but I sure have a soft spot for those era Fords.
nitwit
Hilarious
Old truck guy wins
What year is that beast?
Just got the floor pans to fix my ventilation holes, not gonna miss em' in the winter....
old school truck on 44s all day for me haha. great vid
Damn that's a good looking 79. I'd love to have a 429 haha even with today's gas prices.
AC..55 roll down...old school..COME ON!!
44inch wheels are for female monster trucks
De old is definitely better
Damn I wish I could find my dad's old truck like that.
God damn I’d love to see these 2 characters square up
They are both trash. The only thing a ford is good for is a boat anchor.
a truck is a semi
The air vent for spittin has me sold
I would take the old truck over the new one thats when trucks were made good
Old F350 owners know how to get back in... they grab the steering wheel and reef on it over and over again until the steering wheel flops around like yer willy does after the action is over.
Classic trucks win
Old man truck all the way
I'm a little late to the video... but the bit about the Russian hacking hits a bit differently for some reason...
Man if that f100 was going any slower it would be going backwards. Jesus Christ. 429 pushing out like 27 horsepower sure will move that truck along.
Do love some Mickey T’s…
Hit me up on life alert if you need any help! My sides hurt after hearing that with laughter!
Relatable
You don’t need no fancy shmancy tools to work on that ol’ man’s truck, just a few wrenches and a screwdriver
Me just wishing I could afford a truck.
Lmfao the accuracy
"Russia hacking my truck",Omg 😆 I can't stop laughing, am weak asf! 🤣 hilarious... lots of love from Caguas Puerto Rico. 🇵🇷
I love this truck content bc I really want one in the next couple years lol
amazing truck classic
I'd rather have that old rust bucket then that over engineered joke stroke,o by the way stroker,how's that 5000.00 tune up,or that 1500.00 ecu,or that800.00ficum module?oh by the way,has your crankshaft broke in half yet, they vlike to right behind the balancer,
Still a Ford said the Chevy girl...😁 just joking!
Not a Ford man but 460 Big Block Ford bored and stroked to maximum about 545 CID with stock block.   Big Block Chevy Stock block with maximum bore and stroke 516 CID. But Big Block Chevy aftermarket Sonny's Racing Engines Chey 1005 CID Mountain Motor. or Pro Line Chevy Engines up to 3,500 Horsepower Ginger Lilly Ha Ha.
You need a top gear job 🤣
Sick f150 👍
sir. love the efford in your vids.
Thank God for Ginger Billy!
I vote for the real merica truck
Why does the f150 have 6 lug chevy axles though... 6 lug two piece wheel adaptors on 5 lug f150 axles?
Tsl super swampers thats a real bad ass tire
I must say, that was seriously entertaining I enjoyed you as both characters and I see the advantage of both trucks! My truck is more like the old one. Although I think I need some new glow plugs… If it’s under 50°F the damn thing won’t start very easily without plugging in the oil heater.
Both trucks are beautiful   😍
Guy up in the mountains the other day asked me if I know of any used 4x4 trucks for sale. So I did an InterWeb search: typical 1979 F-150 4WD with 95,000 miles (that's right, a 42 year old truck) is currently (March 2022) selling for average $25,000. Isn't that about TWICE what it cost new?!? More than Twice?
Dont forget that 2' truck bed you cant fit shit in
I gotta get overhauls now lol
Who wants the MURICA truck, and who wants the Modern truck?
Once they get the new trucks paid for they will be in the classic group.
Lol, I'd honestly take that square body over the new Ford.
videos alot better imagining theyre toyotas or gm
Classic trucks are way better then newer that's facts
Drink coffee at the hardees... LUL
i have a 1995 f150 that i bought 3 years ago with over 2k miles, she has a few scratches and dings but she run great. and for the most part i can replace parts my self. havent had to go to a dealership at all.
The great truck wars
I gotta say . I'm an old truck man.
They both share one thing in common: Most of them haul nothing but air in the trunk.
In my old truck I would back up until I hit the tree. When I got the new one, bent my bumper first day.
Funny 👍 the thing I like about my 69 Ford F-250 is I can wash it out with a garden hose, everything is easy to get to and parts don’t cost a fortune
OMG. Too funny. I had a 1970 Ford with 44’s in highschool and now have an F350. This brings memories.
He’s got the 2-60 A/C. 2 windows down at 60 mph😂
Russian Hackers ! 😆
"When it starts raining and you dont wanna get your fancy shmancy truck wet you can park it under my truck" ginger billy dont know he just made the burn of the century lmao
I had a 79 1 ton almost just like that except it was a long bed! It was fun for about 5 minutes! 🤣🤣
Classic all day everyday
He knows what brand is best
That old truck will be around long after that PowerStroke is recycled into tuna cans….
My 85 f150 with the 300 will die when it hits 1 mil, not 1 million miles, but 1 million rollovers of the odometer
The truck gang at the end is the best part
1.5 million people watch this crap lol
I'd take that "Rust Bucket" over ANY new truck!!!!! Lol the 77-79 Ford is the best looking truck ever made!!!!
Hilarious! 😂
Where my Square body boys at??  SB TRUCK GANG!!!!
1:20 that aged well
🤣🤣🤣
Modern trucks, hell modern cars in general are shit... my truck is 30 years old and I'll still be driving it for another 30 years when that "pretty little" F350 is rotting away in a junk yard lol. I'll take an old truck or car any day over some new piece of shit.
I think I would pick the rust bucket.
Personally I like 6.7s, but I'd rather take that 79 any day
Dear God this was hilarious! 🤣
I’d take that classic over the modern one. Teardrop pop-out windows, carburetor, mechanical systems🤤. Versus an IT-required maintenance professional to even remotely go near the new one with a wrench.
I enjoyed this video content.
I'm going to drink coffee at the Hardee's 😆😆😂
Trucks from the 70s are so sexy
Russian hackers? Classic!
I'll take the old one. Them 6.7s are nothing but trouble
"Whatd That Come With A Bottle Of Viagra And a Walker!?" Lmao Im Cryin
"I aint gotta worry bout russians hackin inta my truck"..............Dead
Only pussies need heated and ac leather seats. An unnecessary luxury we get charged WAY to much for.  I miss those '79 Fords. Simple and easy to fix. No computer masters degree needed
I love that old truck
I would take that old Ford any day over a new $90k F350. Them old Fords are complete beauties.
They both have their own perks but I will continue to stand by old trucks till I die
Older=simpler
Having owned both a classic and modern truck, I opt for the Prius.
set the accelerator pump on the carb and bump timing up to about 26 degrees and that stall will go away when you take off ginger feller
Both those trucks are bad ass but I’d gladly take that “rust bucket” over any new truck.
HighBoys Rock!
The new truck will rust out and be scraped before the old truck
Good stuff!!!!!
That 78-79 ford🥵
1984 d150 on a 4x4 RC frame 12" lift ,37 " military OZs Wouldn't trade it for the newest ,nicest truck.
This guy is too funny! I lived in the south for about 5 years and met several guys like this. Good people that would give you the shirt off their backs if you asked.
gingerbilly's best one
I have a 86 f250 4x4. Trying to get 12 in suspension lift. Anyone here have any ideas on what he did to that truck in order to lift it?
I took my daughter for a drive in my pops C10. She went to roll down the window and couldn’t find the button, and ask where it’s at. I pointed to the window crank and said get busy🤣
Give me old trucks anyday no computer bs and easy to work on if something goes wrong!
well... i have a truck that u have to hand crank to start it... also... theres no ac and heat in the cab
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍I would take either one but it is hard to beat the look of them old Fords.
I wouldn't trust that old guy. He's got shifty eyes.
Dodge cummins gang  “Comment here”
I like classic trucks though....
Hit the life alert🤣💀
That’s funny
I actually always wanted a 70s ford f series with the big block 460 and 3 or 4 speed manual. Always thought it'd be one badass truck to drive whenever until I ran outta gas lmao
Truck Gang!!!
you forgot the reason that classics are made of actual metal lol
i prefer the older models in my opinion
Sorry
It was a joke
New ford suck old fords are better but want no what even better doge and cumins 😂 jole
My 1984 has them same "ventilation" holes
New or old, you ALWAYS need to be weary of Russian hackers hacking into your truck
Both trucks are f-350s
LOL
Iam on the red truck side I mean I do like the ford dually...
I want that old school truck
Those are RC cars get you also some Chevy GMC action going on lmao 😂😂😂😂
Old trucks are better cause they gots an ashtray for my Palllllll Mallllllls
im going to drink coffee at the hardee's
Lmao
I want that old ford. Man I do love them. Lucky guy
Hilton Motel 🤣
Only thing this video is missing is the 10mins of struggling it took to get from up off his stomach & into the Truck GanG position in the last transition at the end 🤔🤣🦆
I prefer old trucks over new and I'm only 25 my truck is a 79 f250 ranger with a 460 edelbrock 4 barrel same as bigfoot I prefer old vehicles along with the truck I have a 74 fiat x19 and a 64 1/2 mustang
Classic > New EVERYDAY of the week! <3
This just made me want to play SNOWRUNNER.
Two words mean 3 Everything "Truck Gang"!
I'd take the old truck over the new anyway. That's a fine vehicle
Has anybody seen somebody swap a corvette LS6 twin turbo V8 into a C10😉 do you think it will work or not.
Love it u r so dumb u and my dad should meet lol
Damn good old boys
Nail polish and a dress??? LMAOOOOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!!!
Cringe That’s all I can say these guys are cringe
Should do a comparison about the amount of tools needed to workm.on them. You need an f350 to haul all the special tools, and computers to haul all the tools for these new imitation trucks.
https://youtube.com/shorts/6wmvGWos8ts?feature=share
What truck is that “rust bucket”
Russians hackers (dies laughing)
I don’t know how I got here, BUT…. I like it!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Drank coffee at the Hardee's Lol
New trucks don't have much ground clearance sadly.
I love cars
My t birdy got one of them 429 big blocks and they run like a charm
😂 😂 don’t you talk about my wheels
This man was born to make us laugh
"That truck was made when America was America"  no lie, this is why i like old American vehicles
That ol Ford is nice
🤣 I had two of them rust buckets. 72s
Dude said hit ya life alert if u need any help Lmao
Sorry fellow young people, but I'm on the side of the 70s Ford guy.  Back when men were men and not betas
Imagine being his neighbor & seeing this being recorded.
Why would the russians hack my truck🤣🤣🤣 this is so me vs my dad
Me who likes both 🙃
Both trucks were Fords so they’re both great
You should place " Trump " flags on your trucks )))
"Hit your life alert if you need anything "...LOL
OMG! Laughing so damn hard gotta take two Tylenol for my head!!  ✊🏾🤣😂🤣😂 #TRUCKGANG  💪🏾
I would rather have the old truck
Give me the 15 inch lifted big block please
i love how there isnt one dislike
A feeler sing about snow on your big rusty truck contact me please
Truck gang!🤣
three fitty
Here in Honolulu Hawaii, dude's with lifted trucks be going over tiny speed bumps at a half mph 🤣 pansies 🤣🤣🤣
Die hard GM/Chevy/Yoter fan here... And I must say... That's a dam fine Ford.  🇺🇸
sorry but that ole truck better built then that new ford all you need is to blow on the new truck an by then you need to get it repaired because of that damage ya done to it
Ford build strong
I honestly like older more
And how big are those tires because I want to get that lift kit with those tires on my truck when I get it
I really want to get a truck like that but Ford F-150 91 how high is that lift like how many inches is it
That truck was made when America was AMERICA
2:33 bro see that spit bottle buy a mudjug dude their better than a waterbottle
I miss the old days. Trucks in the 70's and 80's where very simplistic compared to the newer computer run everything version today. Then you needed a wrench, screw driver, hammer and maybe a socket wrench. Today , you need a programmer, a 15 year old to run it, and a fist full of cash for those costly but cheap plastic parts.
I dig both of those tricks but I'm team oldschool all day
That you used a Ford for this example made me lost a bit of faith in your views
TRUCK GANG!
Me just bought a 2016 6.7 powerstroke with black heated and cooled seats also own a 92 f150 a 89 f250 and a 51 f1 🤣
Absolutely correct that’s what truly American made trucks look like
This guy is effing hilarious
"Is this thing a truck or a Hilton hotel?!" Lmao 🤣
Yee yee
The old truck had those little windows we called hillbilly AC
I'd rather have that ole ford I can fix that with fence wire and a hammer
Hahaha I got that same F250 with a 351 with 900-16s, Also have a 71 W200 I bought for 300 bucks, my goin to town truck is an 89 F250 IDI all of em are painted green with a roller....
You know it's the south when they're arguing about trucks but at the end of the day the younger dude will always offer help to the older guy
I'll take the old one...
This a 6-7 paer stoke 😂
"I'm going to drink coffee at Hardees" thats so true about old southern men.
😅😅🤣🤣🤣😭😭😎🤔🤔
the f450 is better than the f350
Love my 85 6.9. hole in the floor board and manual windows. ♥️♥️
alt title:  "CHAD" truckers vs "a little less chad" truckers
This is basically me debating with myself when im alone
All the money and fame and you're still needing worship.
I need to do what he did to that old 78-79 ford cause it look like a beast
1:30 A very good point
0:05 he made the right choice by buying a ford and not a broken down junk heap chevy
1:26 someone play the national anthem and hold up a giant flag now please haha
In all honesty I'd take that highboy any day
Great video man.
Unfortunately the F350 is a wife’s truck. Said the F450 owner!😂🤣😂
since he is such an enthusiast truck gangster, are Land Rovers part of the gang?
Every car maker in America should hire Billy to do their commercials.
My truck has cfi and power windows and stuff but I don't know that I would call it "new age" it's about as basic as it gets. Basically imagine a classic truck but with all the the normal operations electric and that's my truck. It's a very standard reasonable vehicle lol
That was funny as hell bro. But can't deny what you're saying is true. Old geezer with pillow as beer belly cant hide the masive pair of guns thou hahaha!! Joke aside, when you like to get your hands dirty and you live in the countryside or outback, you're better off with those high tech electronics. Yet those new ones are just so sweet to drive. Have both if you can afford then. Cheers.
What's wrong with drinking coffee at Hardee's?
I got one of the new ones but still would take the old one to go play in
"Im gonna go drick coffee at the hardy's"🤣🤣🤣 literally the truest stuff ever, that is the accurate👌
I wanna say something about there being a step on that thing but I never used mine either
F crack me up bud.keep it going
Im the classic truck owner
I'm offended that classic Ford truck is running 6 lug Chevy axles. I assume it has a Chevy title too because the door Vin plate is missing. 😆 That's Def a real truck because sometimes you gotta pawn the truck title to pay for momma's dentures!
As a spouse to a man who used to do that LMS (little man syndrome) stuff, I appreciate that you know how ridiculous it is.
Can't wait till the day I can go drink coffee at hardeys too
Almost all of this was dead on. I have a 31-year-old Ford F-150 4x4 with the 5.0 motor and an 8-ft bed. I can let that truck fit for months go out and fire it up and drive off with no problem. I actually have friends of my that have brand new trucks and when they need the haul something heavy every one of them ask to borrow my truck.  The one good thing on both sides of your argument is that you both of them were Fords.
This shit just got annoying
I just want to know where you keep getting all these vehicles from lol
Nice one!!!
Tha old Ford is sweet ol man
I'l stick with my classic truck , I can fix anything that ever goes wrong with it, it cost me under 10k I have driven it over 150k miles and it has 300k plus miles on the odo...still running just fine . modern trucks will give you good amount of miles too , maybe even ore but they cost you 60k to 80k ....so yeah, I will stick with my old truck and keep my money in my pocket.
“I don’t have Russians hacking into my truck.” Lmao best line I’ve heard in a while.
Classic all the way
How many people I ve heard living in NC Mickey Thompsons and Super Swampers.
In my opinion a 429 Big Block is more badass than a 6.7 Powerstroke
The classic truck definitely sounds more badass!!!
We don't drive cars anymore..... these are IPads on wheels
Old truck... Useless on road. New truck... Useless in dirt My 2000 Expedition on 34s... Unstoppable everywhere
This dude is absolutely crazy fucking love him great content bro 🤣🤣🤣😂
Where do you get all these cars
Real shit tho, newer trucks are garbage compared to the 80's to mid 90's trucks. Especially Chevys
Ha you need them fancy tires to get across country? Real men back in my day used horses!
Too funny!!   If you were in Maine, I’d buy you a beer!
Could've ended mans career by sayin "AaaaAAAaat leeast my TRucK is PAYDDD FAA!!" 😧
power stroke sucks
My truck is not classic nor new
I got an 86 ford ranger longbed in midnight blue, 5 speed to learn stick on. Easy to fix, can afford parts. Truck gang
All I can say, is my classic hunk of American steel is my favorite to drive... period.  Back when engineering was done on paper, by hand.. By people who didn't need to write the math down, but did it so they could try and attempt to explain to the bean counters why they needed such a MASSIVE budget.  Everything was over-built, now days every part is built to be just barely good enough to do its task, and then fail after a pre-determined amount of time so you have to go buy another plastic car.

I’m the BIG TRUCK Guy!!!!
We all know we want that rusty monster!
Still love me my new Manual Tacoma. Gonna be around for a while, it's a manual so...yeah suck it. Oh and I don't spend as much money in gas, because fuel efficiency is just an all around better way to save money. That being said I don't have a bias for new vs old ...just against automatic transmissions.
Keep up with it I laughed so hard I fell off my bed thank u I need a good laugh today and happy holidays 🙂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀☠☠☠
My man, if you don't want that ol' classic you just go on ahead and let me know lol.
Did ur truck come with a bottle of Viagra and a walker😂😂😂😂😂😂 i died laughing lol
Gotta 75 f100, came with a power steering AND disc brakes. And a 360 and for the record that fe motor sounds gooood
He said he ain’t gotta worry about no Russian hackers 😂😂🤣
“This truck was made when America, was America” LMAO 😂😂
Me: (Fitting 38" swampers under a rusty '78 Ramcharger, without a lift) "Where's the sawzall?"  And I did just that, too...! ;D
i am a die hard, anti- ford guy, but got damn son, i'd drive that old rusted sumbitch errr day.
I drive old trucks for the exact reason that you said my vehicles aren't ran by a whole bunch of sensors.... I can crawl under the hood of my truck and work on it and it doesn't cost me thousands of dollars to fix it when it breaks down.... Plus I drive Chevy's.... Only retards drive forwards
i feel both sides pov but i know the old school truck is racist
Spit my Copenhagen i died thanks bro your worth my few minutes of my life
I’ll take the 77 Ford pick up truck any day of the week seriously I hate all new trucks plastic fake crap junk unreliable TwinTurbo V6’s Chevys V6 diesel for the Colorado pick up truck and the eco-boost Ford keeps pushing into every vehicle they can bunch of junk and old crappy fancy wheels does a rare available will never see dust let alone any mud or dirt
Me driving past in my Toyota hybrid: 🤣
I got a 1968 F250 4x4 waiting for restoration in Baja !
They do NOT make them like they used to....that's for damn sure!! Give me an old time truck ANY DAY OF THE WEEK! <3
Fuel rims do look way worse than any m/t he's got a good point there.
I can spit my Copenhagen through there 😳🤣 I prefer the old truck👍
GB. Need you to take the v8 snowblower out for a rip! https://youtu.be/zvR-eaKUVqU
fantastic i am maybe turning to jesus to thank him for you hilarious
Snoop Diggity Dawg
Lmfao but yes I'll take the old truck not a computer on wheels xdd
This was honestly funny as hell.
The wheels 🤣🤣🤣🤣 thank God them horrible wheels I will never understand on a 4x4s
To use it as a weapon 😭🤣💀
Ginger Billy, Can you please stop making these videos....I laugh too much watching them.
I love this dude 🤣🤣🤣
Lmao 🤣🤣🤣
So I have a 1978 f150 with a 460 in it sitting on 35's....and a new f250.  I have this conversation with myself every day.
His house lol cuz new trucks are the cost of a house
“Ah gotter Wender” 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
If I had the money, I'd own both. The classic as my Sunday cruiser and the modern one as my daily. The modern one is easier to replace.
What I want to know. On that lifted truck if it gets a flat, how is it suppsed to get fixed?
I'm with the old Ford,  when they were still ALL ford
I hope your taking an anti-estrogen...
vent windows are air conditioner
Who won?  WHO CARES!  Both trucks are bad a$$!
Jesus loves you so much he died for you give your life to him and ask for forgiveness
I miss my '91 Ranger. That truck just ran.
I got a winder! Haha! 😂🤣🤣
I own a 1983 Ford F-350 with a 7.5 Liter V8. It's a nice truck.
Holy shit LMFAO I'm crying I'm laughing so hard
You are awesome amigo. Thanks for your videos.
The old ford is less shity than the new ford... but a 78 c10 would embarrass it.. yea thats right a 2wd chevy
Billy thanks for posting made about all of us laugh I know it took a bit of effort to do film you did good
I put the same style stirrup step on my 91' F250 I bought new, climbed in the same way but with more grace, I'm a 5'4" woman, lol. Miss that truck.
Ford is Ford.
When you have both
LMAO!!!
I need a truck out of my truck for Christmas that has LED lights and built-in the box so people can molars coming in
Who else here ride in the middle of these two
You been eating them trenoblone sandwiches again
Was almost hoping someone else would pull up in a Chevy or Dodge, hop out and be all "What y'all talkin' bout?". Then the 2 ford guys would put their differences aside and tell the intruder to get'on, git!.
Lmao !!!  Hill billy Comedy !!
I had a buddy of mine who put thunder Cobra jet motor and tranny from a 69 ford Thunderbird into one of those old Ford f250s. That thing was awesome.
"The gin and juice" 😂😂
I don't own a truck, and I'm only 34, but I'm all about old truck.
What model is the older one
My dad has both a new and old truck. I don't know where he fits into this. He is also ginger
Imagine watching this from like another paddock it'd just be some guy talking to himself.

Russian hacker... 😆
This guy is way too funny for YouTube.
😂😂 im going to drink coffee at the hardees
At 3:32 I started crying 😭 when he couldn't get in the truck....
"TRUCK GANG "😆😆😆
This reminded me to fix my ac lmao
New trucks are just a piss poorly made SUV with a fat ass.  Them old trucks were built as trucks to do truck things.  When I had my old 88 F250 XLT Lariate that thing would haul anything.  Still have my 85 F150 4X4 standard short frame off road model with thst straight 300 6 that's just bulletproof.
I finally got a Pickup Truck Ginger Billy “TRUCK GANG!” 😂😂
Dislike
The old guy made some good points.
10/10 so funny!!!
@ginger billy 2021 gingerbilly aint even hit the same.... your shorts needs to be tighter.
Should've ended up in a tug of war
Can you do quiet exhaust vs loud exhaust and they fight about mufflers and how one is loud and one is quiet?
Now that's a truck classic all the way
When the old one breaks down, it's usually super easy to fix. When the new one breaks down, you either take it to the dealership and pay thousands of dollars, or become a computer technician to fix it.
Old Skool will always outcome better. Funny how some guys put 8" lifts on there newer units and it look like a 2 1/2" lol. 8" on a ole sum bitch you up in the sky with your 40s. Love me a 15" rim.
Give me the old timer any day I agree that's a real truck no computers needed 😂
I'll take the old rust bucket.
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THAT DAMN DENTSIDE IS SEXXXYYYYYY
Classic trucks are BADASS!
Just thake the old shit. Easy to repair and do not need a pc .
🤣
Miss my 78 Bronco... 'Course, it was titled as a "station wagon," but close enough.
"I aint got to worry about no russians hackin' into MY truck!!"   That was god damn legendary man
I’ll take an old truck over a new truck any day!
Drink coffee at the Hardee's 😂
The same douche would own both trucks
Mmmm I love the old style truck with the foot high beam switch and when vehicles had 2 keys.
The 350 may be prettier but damn me if that old square body isn't a thing of my dreams. 🤤
I have to say I fell in love with that old beast of a forbi
This guy have the same body language as character in GTA5
Maid N 'Merica
Russian hackers
New trucks are kinda prissy when you put it like that
That guys in amazing shape. I need to diet. My wife is a nurse and showed me his nurse wife videos lol
The only thing that matters is… They are both FORDS! TRUCK GANG!!!
The old truck brings back some fun highschool memories. I miss seeing more of these on the road. I can't stand these new trucks w/massive chrome rims an a centimeter of rubber. Love watching them get bent on a curb though 🤣
Funny story they are related
" this is my air-condition," I just can't 🤣
the way he said "shewt" 0:48 😂 okay and the hand gesture 2:55 😂
1:27! 🗣️
I see a problem with both trucks.  They’re Fords
Bruh my truck uses the power of the engine to literally coolest the cab with the fan and it's super loud
Murica!!!🇺🇸
“I’m gonna go drink coffee at the Hardee’s” best exit line.
Hilarious Man!!!!
Wtf xD lmao i needed this
"I GOTTA WINDER"
OG Landy and Defender Owner: "lol"
When you watch this and realize your Nissan Frontier parked outside is more American than most modern American trucks because it was built in Mississippi and all you hear is Hank Williams III singing about mud and moonshine.
TG all day
As a person owning a 91 f150 I can confirm
How British people think Americans argue:
Truck is sick and i hate fords
Old is gold
That truck was made when America was America. He ain't lying
Great video! Thanks.
LMFAO!!!
"That there is a 15" lift so if it starts raining and you don't want your truck to get wet, you can park it under my truck."
"That truck was made when 'merica was  'merica"
Me and my little Tacoma drives up...and keeps going...cuz thats what Tacoma's do...
This entire video👌
They're both right 💯💯 😂🖕
I don't drive a truck, but my A/C unis is the same as the classic truck
Lol he said Snapper lawn mower 🤣 Haven't heard that name in awhile
HA! ❤
I’d take that classic in a heart ❤️ beat
He must be a *ford man*     Good thing or I'd have to *unsubscribe*
Ok hit that life alert if you need help.
I just realized I’m an old man!!!
UK and Europe, kindly don't even try to understand this. Believe it or not, it is intellectual, but only for Americans, especially southern Americans to appreciate.
when the time comes and i can afford a chevy c10..
youtube unsubscribed me
This is the Walmart parking lot everyday in my town.
I think classic vehicles can be built more powerful and more awesome lookin then vehicles of today.
They should be making these old fords f this chip shortage bull isht
we all know that the old truck was the best
All I see here are real trucks, Ford trucks
"Boy is this thang a truck, or is it a Hilton motel, huh?!" 😂
eww a ford fca ftw
Love that F100!!! Timeless classic 👌
Am i the only one who feels that he sounds like mickey mouse but angry?
I was dying laughing looking at what basically my HS truck (except a Ram) was like compared my GMC Dually today!
My crank window is not broken. The glass came loose from  the carrige. There us a difference..
I'd take the ol dentside any day.  Drove a '79 f100 back and forth cross country for years chasing work.  Never left me sitting.
This is so….bad. Jesus christ who tf finds this funny.
New model trucks get into a wreck? Get crushed like a beer can.  Classic trucks get in a wreck? Destroys anything it hits and only suffers a dent in the frame.
Where's the mud grips lol
😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is hilarious! Thank you 🙏🏾 YouTube algorithm
You tube...why would you send me this while im smokin a blunt!!!!?🤣🤣🤣🤣 ima have to go wit OG Red... park that lil thang under my truck!...but his ole ass c7dnt climb back in!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 man you jus got yoself a subscriber!!   ima Diesel Brother kinda guy!.. ✔💯💪🏾👍🏿
This was really well done in my opinion.  Hold my beer while I go start my Honda
This is so entertaining
Don't you ever forget about the bench seat!
Honestly Fuel wheels are pretty trash. You don't see a lot Mickey Thompsons anymore but they're worth it.
What about steam powered trucks lol 😂 steam lorries 🚛
This could be one of the greatest vids on YouTube! 😂💀
bruh even got the chest right for them old men i dont know how they chest built like that XD
I've never had a problem with owning or meeting either side of the truck fans, I like newer because newer, but I like older trucks because it's not gonna cost me a house to repair when the warranty expires
Accurate AND painful to watch, and they’re both half right. Well done!
My dad's squarebody had ventilation windows, not holes.
Bet.. that there OLD TRUCK…. Came with an ASH TRAY..🚬
Truck gang
Pulling up on the steering wheel.... I guess you haven't rebuilt a tilt steering column yet...
1987 F150 owner checking in.
I remember sitting in my grandpa's classic truck when I was little: The seats were uncomfortable, there was no AC, the radio was archaic, which probably doesnt matter as the thing was so damn loud you couldnt hear it anyway. And a rather lovely eagle mural in the back window.  RIP
Ain't nothing can compare to classic old school off road square body trucks like they say, real trucks are built, not bought🤙🏻💯
I'm gonna go drink coffee at Hardee's lmao
Beeewbs
+1 for I'd take the older truck. Btw, that ain't rust. It's a patina.
goofy
I'd drive the new one and pull that classic behind me to the mud hole
This video is 4 minutes long but it feels like it's 12 minutes long
Welp...this was possibly made in north or south Carolina based on the Hardee's reference lol
Im going to start telling people I chose a twelve valve so “russian hackers dont use my 4x4 as a weapon” 🤣
Felt attacked when he brought up heat and ac as I live in az with neither. 87 yota  pickup owner
hah I'm in the market for a truck. too funny
This is too funny
Most of my newer vehicles seemingly has went to the scrap yard & I've owned well over 100 vehicles. . . Anything 80s and older are still road worthy.
with all the problems getting reliable parts... i will take the older trucks vs newer... so many newer trucks i know of that have parts prone to failure that keep them sitting around home not in regular use... hell i know 3 ppl with trucks with f-ed transmissions (GMC made some truly horrid transmissions..)
OMG dude you’re hilarious you could be a professional comedian if you’re not already!!
I would totally take the old ford vs new. and that's coming from a chevy guy!
Oh man I feel targeted! 😂.  As the owner of a 78 F150 I’ll tone it down a bit! 😂
Him getting in and out of the truck was the funniest!
I drive a classic and I’ve said pretty much everything that was said in this vidoe including spitting dip Thru the hole in the floor 😂
😂😂😂
The weather there looks gorgeous
that's some funny shit right there... THANKS, I NEEDED THAT!
im with the geezer on this one.
I drive the shit out of the old truck.
My truck looks like this so their trucks can look like that
The "win-dur" instead of "window" earned a thumbs up.
Modern Diesels suck for one reason alone. DEF. "I'm sorry, my truck isn't running because it doesn't have enough urine in it."
OUTSIDE of being a Ford owner This is me so I guess I can't talk  sh+
The Powerstroke would snap that big block
Just so ya know, you should've stuffed your shirt a little lower. Instead of looking like you had a gut? You looked like you had a set of double D's.
Gimme that good ol country truck it will outlast the new one at 1/20th of the price.
I'll take the classic one.
Is there an in between age truck. Where you show up in a late 90's early 2000's Toyota
I love the 6 seats.
Ayyyy wait 4 years it won't work real good 🤣🤣
Russian hackers literally just hacked Hyundai Kia lmao
Yeah I'll take the Mickey Thompson's any day. Older trucks look better anyways.
😂😂😂
Friend of mine bought a brand new 450 and doesn’t like to put stuff in the bed because he, and I quote “doesn’t want to scratch the bedliner”
I like some new trucks, I think the blingy low profile tires and work style trucks absolutely do not go together. I think trucks are becoming more “toys” than work vehicles.. Older stuff is often easier to work on, way cheaper, not about those new modular LED head lights and break lights that are 3/4/ hell 6 hundred a piece… specialty tools, no room in the engine bay… 6.7 is bad ass though, hard to hate on..
Seems like two generations of small pecker guys hashing it out at eachother over the wrong things. They are both caught up in what the car companies sold them; an image of a strong free American male. Only difference is the monthly payments on that f350. As with the old stuff: I liked it till I looked up close. That's some self hating masochistic agricultural equipment. Cool for a mile, hurts for a while.
Crazy how Ford's 429 is a big block, and gm considers their 429 a small block lol
Hell yeah brother! Got my ‘01 Chevy Tahoe on a lift with some big ole wheels and tires. Classic trucks all day baby🤘
Lmao bruh
That was pretty good there.
I'll take the shitbox any day. They don't die after 50k
Imagine that he did all of this by himself, nobody was holding the camera ( phone ) for him, and all of those angles...😂 that was nice, i liked it.
Step boards are for handicapped people
I think this is my favorite Ginger Billy vid.
Gotta 78 Bronco same color, looks the same
Forgot the guy rolling up in a GMC dressed in business causal :D
Trucks are for people working on farms, for the rest it’s a dick extension.
@ 1:25 It's sad how to true that is 😔 when America was America oh how sad
Old one is still better.  Why.  Its still there.
As much shit as they both talked..... they seem to have a similar taste in tattoos.
The "I'm gonna go drink coffee at the Hardee's" had me rolling 🤣
I have a 89 first gen Cummins over 3/4 of a million miles never had to fix a thing on it I buy a brand new Chevy turbo takes a shit in the first 10k miles I fix and trad it in on a Ford dpf system shits the bed 6k cash later I sell it not to mention the first gen got better mpg then both of them and sounds alot better too old school stuff may not be the fastest or the best every time but it always works and reliability is more important to me then anything in the truck
Hey the old truck doesn't keep track of your whereabouts and sends it to Google so they can sell it to advertisers. Just saying.
Boi is that a truck or a Hilton hotel room? This was genuinely funny 😅
Them "fuel tires" is made for driving through the mall parking lot. Damn straight 🤣🤣🤣
Was made when murica was murica...truck is still a piece of crap
I just bought a new ford, its like driving around inside of an ipad. I like it, its nice. But, my first car was a 1986 chevy cavalier. Didnt change the oil in 100k miles. One time it ran so low on oil the oil gauge just started jumping around, drove it 70 miles back to the town I live in, topped it off and it still ran for years after that. I got rid of it because my brother drove it into a tree but it still started, just undrivable.
I drive by these guys all the time giving them the side eye in my supercharged tundra.
the a/c is the wings tho
I think everyone here feels attacked on a personal level.  I'm fairly young and I appreciate the older trucks more than I do the newer ones I like all the amenities and the things they have in newer vehicles, but I don't like how hard they are to work on if you know how to work on one and I really don't like the look of newer vehicles and love the look of classic vehicles. It just feels like they're trying to look futuristic but doing a really crummy job at it with the new ones. And to be honest YES the older vehicles didn't break down as much because they weren't as complicated and were built by companies that weren't entirely for-profit and were sort of focused on keeping people that would buy their products and not spread word that their products were bad and broke easily, they had built-in obsolescence back then but it was in a superficial social way in that "oh my neighbor just got the latest model of this vehicle so I'd better get it to not be outdone" but now built-in obsolescence is just saying that a vehicle will go up to 1 million miles and then it may start having trouble but actually it will just break down at 200,000.
I got a 78 f150 and man does it run better than any new truck ive had
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I loved every second of this.
I'm a need about tree fiddy
That's not the air conditioning, the air conditioning is the flip out quarter light
I'm 56 years old and I would still take the older truck any day!!!
hate to say it , but the old truck is a little light, its a 1/2 ton.    but would rather drive a old truck,
To be fair the older truck not having computers is fair, because it essentially means that vehicle owners can no longer repair how they want
Indeed
This guy is gold. As a Texan I approve
44s on Mickey Thompsons is just a whole other animal.
The second he started pulling on his steering wheel to get up I was screaming "your column pins!!!!" Out loud.....
If you gave me that new F-350, I’d sell it and buy the old one and put the rest in the bank! New trucks are stupid. My 25 year old 12 valve will do everything a new truck can do, for 1/7th the cost!
Why dose the "old man" have a sweet rack?
LMAO , this was great good job man damn !
🤣
The Hilton "MOTEL". Ha!
This truck was made when American was America. Cant argue with that
Omg that was hysterical! 🤣
Then there's me in my 10th gen f150 and every single truck owner including ford owners look at me with disgust😔
Truck was made when merica was Merica. Down right hilarious! Good shit!
When America was America. That comment wins everything. It cant ve beaten. America today is a disgrace and im ashamed to live here anymore.
When America was America. That comment wins everything. It cant ve beaten. America today is a disgrace and im ashamed to live here anymore.
When America was America. That comment wins everything. It cant ve beaten. America today is a disgrace.
When America was America. That comment wins everything. It cant ve beaten. America today is a disgrace.
What about us who own both? lol
Thanks now my sides hurt. Hilarious 😂
I take sides with the old school trucker,less complicated stuff.except yes u do need a latter 2 get on the old truck.
These men are the reason Hardees in Lebanon, Indiana is even open.
Gonna need you to stop recording my uncle.
thats a nice truck
Geezer!🤣🇬🇧🇺🇸
This is effin HILARIOUS
Basically the truck community trying to agree on something
That's why I got a 90s chevy. Still simple, classic looks, with leather heated seats, ac, and a bulletproof motor
I was expecting both of them to get in their trucks and neither one of them would start😂
Oof that steering column.  My 91 f350 had a 8 inch lift and the column had to be replaced due to people yanking on it
Dude I drive a 79 F150, this exact thing happened to me last week
hahahaha!
I was surprised by how much this made me laugh, especially the line at the end about going to drink coffee at Hardee’s... know plenty of old timers around here that do just that.
He lost the argument with: “Heated seats”! That truck not only came with nail polish & a dress, it came with face cream!😜  Well, hell yea I’m old... What bout it!😎
I'm sorry I'll take that ol rust bucket any day lmfao 🤣 😂
Nothing like 78 ford with 351 mod. Non liter bull.
both of em are compensators if you ask me
New fords come with recalls... standard!  Days of "warranty " work... standard!   Ford uses "extended coverage" for non safety  because it sounds better then recall
Best thing about a Ford, is that they circle what's wrong with it and stick it on the grill, and the tailgate.    Let's see how many misspelled responses we get...
You can add onto the classic everything the disposable truck has that the classic doesnt but you cant restore biodegradeable parts the late model with an expiration date has an abundance of.....sorry youngins but the truth and reality hurts
You see this beauty its a beast lmfaoo truck gang🤣
Snoop diggy dogg🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have a brand new Trail Boss and a 1982 GMC 4X4 diesel. They both have their purpose. GMC is mountain, hunting, wood hauler, and anything the mountains of Montana can throw at it. Trail Boss is for everything else.
True🤣🤣
I gotta go with the old style
87 F150 here... First year of Fuel Injection for Fords xD. Only good feature of a *modern truck* especially up north in the winter.
This is like AK vs AR. Proven rugged durable platform vs fancy shiny performance model. The difference is the new truck will be much nicer for a long time but once the plastic and electronics get old it won't be so great anymore
New trucks SUCK. They should have never invented anything other than a 15 inch wheel. EFF your computer. That 6.7 sure isn't going to be around like that old fooker still is. EFF your stupid pointed hood. Suppository looking piece of crap.
That big truck needs some final drive attention. Lol
Man get a shirt & pants on not some skin tighties
Yeah I've been looking for a truck and this is just hilarious I kind of like old school a little more simple I can't get hacked
To bad they are both a Ford..... what a shame.....
"Hit your life alert." Hahaha! He had a foot peg there don't know why he had so much trouble climbing in.
Idk personally I’d take the new f350…… just to sell it and get a bunch of old trucks 😁
For your information I have never gotten myself stuck trying to climb back into my truck. Though I have almost fallen out… that part is true… pfft… air conditioning..,
Lol I love it!! When I got my Raptor, my dad told me I can float off into space with my cute little modern Space shuttle. And he’s go off in his AMERICAN cold steel MAN truck!!
The most country man I ever see
yall can have that new one give me that old one.
that old ford is kinda sexy not gunna lie
Love the old trucks
And that short bed four wheel drive F100 is still more valuable than that F-350.... I know because I have own ed a bunch of old Ford trucks and a bunch of new Ford trucks and every time I sell an old truck I get more money than I ever did from a new truck
I wish you did a real life cost comparison between the two!😮
Compared to the trucks I work with every day those are both small. We consider f550s "mini"
Grew up in a 78 highboy. Pops had 38s on her stock height.  I put 44s when she was mine forgot what lift I put on her. She was a good truck hard to find the Ford 351 Modified nowadays.
Since when do you have a PowerStroke lol
A truck is a truck, if it hauls, I don't give a rat's  (Well, I guess it also has to have synchros for me if it's manual, but I doubt that oldie is unsynchroed)
ok, so what did they swap the running gear for?...6 lug something...
What if your both? Just sayin.
Whether is Grand dads old Barely moving Ford from the 60's or cousin Allen's 1500 TRX a truck is a truck and they are all products of a man's love to strive forward (accept for squatted Silverado)
I got me a 1983 F250 4x4 Heavy duty 6.9 Diesel, 4 speed. I get the nod from every middle age feller driving newer trucks. I don't get anywhere fast but there's nowhere I can't go.  No sensors, manual roll up windows, no A/C, center dash and door speaker's. . . . Umm that's it.   Millennial anti-theft, 4 speed standard. This CANADIAN 🇨🇦loves AMERICAN🇺🇸 made FORD!!!
1:27 to 1:30 and 1:31 to 1:41 where the best lines
Where you get dem weels from get em from Snop Digity Dawg
Too bad fords are gae
“That’s my real air conditioning!”   LOL
You gotta appreciate him using the word wheels instead of rims 🤙🏽
no longer gucci gang its truck gang !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:30 😭😭
I'd take the Old one....👍🏻🇺🇸
Had me at Harry's
That old body is bad ass I dig it
I dont have to worry about Russians hackin my truck! 😂
I must agree with the old timer, that f350 looks more like it's ready to be parked outside the hilton hotel under a roof than to do some hard work in a field. The more components you have in a system the higher the chance of failure at baisic tasks.
Is that a Jeep J4000????
ginger billy just hypin up his trucks to himself
Russian hackers….lol
🤣
Smaller wheels are more efficient on trucks.
Lift stance is anti-Tow
I want a big-block in my XJ now.
I have an old bike, but I regularly check my carburetor for Russian hackers; you can't be too careful.
This man is a F-Genius !
I’m still trying to figure out the difference between the two.
Hey!! The real aar conditionin is the triangle window!! 😂😂 open that sucker up on the highway and u got 60mph AC
Man I do like that old Ford a lot.
Shit I’ll buy that old ford any day other that computer on wheels
Old man drinking coffee at the Hardee’s with his truck. Young fella sippin coffee in the service department waiting area with his truck.
New trucks are kind of stupid. $80,000 for a pickup. I'd rather go buy a Dodge viper or a Corvette 😂
He should do it now for pc's/cell phones now.
Ive seen alot more young people drive an old truck as their first rig and learning truck and more old guys drive the newer ones cause it rides softer and easier on their back
hahahhahahahhhaaha
And once again I leave a ginger B video to go check Craigslist for an old truck that runs at a reasonable price…..
Anybody who has actually owned a good truck knows that the "wingwindows" are far superior in cooling where it counts. I call bs.😂
Crazy enough the old lifted truck is far superior to the new one.
#thanktheLordforthebigblockFord #noreplacementfordisplacement #385series #FoMoCo #HellYeahBrother
100% would take the old truck over the new one
😂😂😂👍
Of all the great things you could've said about the classic, the wing windows. That's the real ac
At LeAsT mY tRuCk Do No NeEd DeF
There's two big reasons I clicked on this
Hey good evening Bill i enjoy the show u host I love video so cool nice and good one in great job and bless day
I just wanna know where I can get them overalls at
Man you are so funny
Yeah real men drive old trucks, pansies drive new trucks, no offense don’t take me too seriously
that was a base model f350 interior. i saw that rubber steering wheel. can't fool me
Lol
I love that old truck, does the 350 come with nail polish? My wife was asking
I love to drive new trucks but I love to look at old trucks.  Even the rusty ones.
Lol the way people get into my stock suspension Chevy is ridiculous they look like this ol geezer trying to get in my truck crossing their right leg over their left and I have to give them instructions to get in the truck. 🤣
Never argue with an old man that has tig ole bitties and swamp azz
first time seeing a Vid from you.. I don't get it....  I'll move on
Billy making fun of his own trucks
love the beard bud too bad he has a ford
New 6.7s suck. Lol The older 6.7s will outdo the new ones.
Best thing is there both his truck lol
What year are the trucks?
Tailgate
Yeah im gonna just say this, fuel wheels look like ass on a trashcan. Their design language is just convoluted and tacky.
1:20 crazy Russian hackers even😉😉😉😉😉
6.0 powersmoke your bulletproofed head gaskets
Beautiful swb f150 don’t see them babies hardly anymore love the vids
It's a Ford tho- Found On Road Dead
new cars are Garbage all around
Dudes ripped and have sense of humor nice.
What sort of axles do you have on there with the 6-bolt pattern?
Proud to say that I have had similar conversations to this one.
Wow, I just looked in the mirror......
I have a 2015 Silverado, and it has all kinds of electronic/ computer/ WiFi Internet bugs.. old man is right.
I love trucks.
I want both of em   Please
I feel like him and WD would get along
truck smack talking the healthy form of tribalism
“You have a fancy little truck” “You have teen tiny wheels on your truck” Monster truck shows up.
I’m fucking dying 😂😂
As someone who's owned one from each of the top 3 nothing beats a Highboy with a 460 swap
'High performance MOSHEEN!!'
Old school is better than new school
0:13 Trevor Phillips arrives at a scene!
He said "Snoop Diggity Dogg"
"TRUCK OUT"  fuckin' beauty mate Put it on a shirt or cap, with the fingers n everything
😂✌️
This is one of the greatest videos I have ever seen 😂😂
They both sick af though
One of these trucks has been on the road for 40 years. The other one will be in a junk yard in 20.
fords done really well over the last44 years in trucks
Not a Ford guy but I'll  take that old Ford over any new truck.
Bwahahahahaha. This was too funny. Love it. ❤️
TRUCK GANG 🛻
I have a joke about power stroke ..hold up I'm still working on it lol no worries ford family here
What!?!? no 460 cubic inch big block?
Painful,  operation dumb down America is in full effect
Have a feeling that most of us would love to have that old F150!
I'm definitely on the old truck gang
Hackers or EMPs?
Did yours come with a bottle of viagra and a walker lmao
Love both trucks
Well I’ll be damned’, if this ain’t somethin’!
*TRUCK OUT* Is that what the group of truck kids at every Walmart parking lot say?
This is basically what is going on in society- everyone yelling and screaming at each other over who's the best.
Gotta watch out for them hackers 😄
"Arr condition" lol
Personally I prefer the model AA, easier to work on with the butterfly hood and can go just about anywhere. Plus if your fancy pants battery dies you are stuck, whereas in a AA you can just get out and crank!
“And I can spit my Copenhagen thru there” new truck billy had to leave cuz he knew that he’d been beat🤣
I'm sorry I'd rather be in the old Ford  won't get stuck  in little puddle of water when it rains  lol I'm rugged around the edges  parts are easy to fix, cheap to buy, easy to maintain ....keep up the truck gang man I miss my old chevy 67  it was a head turner short bed sport side small back window  good ol 350
You know that feeling you get when you're kissing your buddy Dale behind the barn. That's what it feels like to drive a ford.
Nice lol
I going to drank coffee at Hardee's lol 😆
Yes FORD Trucks for every! We still have our 1978 Ford truck
Love it! Awesome! Thanks for sharing this with us. I remembered me of my then boyfriend now husband truck that he has for 40 yrs. Yes we had 44's. GOD bless you 👍
Both trucks came with testosterone cypionate and male pattern baldness.
Truck Gang
I'm going to be honest. I was feeling bummed and watching this video just lifted my spirits.
You forgot about the heated seats in that rust bucket, fart! Lol
Both of those trucks are nicer than my car. However I don't need to haul anything and my car gets better gas mileage so 🤷‍♂️. Maybe some day I'll get a truck again
Who needs airbags when your beer gut provides all the protection you could ever need! Now that's money well spent (my wife would probably disagree).
Old guy: my truck runs on fire and bald eagles. Your truck runs on electronics and prayers.  Young guy: your truck onky runs as often as you get laid, my truck can pull a train.  Chevy guy: they are both found on road dead hewhewhew Both fords: at least our wheels don't fall off Dodge guy: gets the shit beat out of him, for just showing up.
I don't even know what to say! LMAOOOOO 🤣😅😂🤣😅🤣😂👍👍👍👍👍👍
That's a lot of tire for a Dana 44 and 9" axle.
Deep down they equally admire and are jealous of each others' truck
😆😆😆
Back when AMERICA was AMERICA..... hahaaaa you damn right son
Well done sir.. lol 😂
Both of the trucks look great 👍👍
The gin and juice😂
The old one sound so much better than the new one
did your truck come with nail polish?
pretty badass old Ford .. really bad ass if it had a Cummins in it
Lmao 🤣
As long as it’s a Ford I’m happy. But you can’t beat a classic.
Both are cool trucks lol. But that old Ford is built better
Yeah yeah yeah....why did that f150 have coil springs and 6 lug nuts in the front???
I bought a brand new F250 in 1976 that truck lasted over 400k not bad for a truck I paid 4k brand new out the door can you get a brand new truck today for 4k out the door,and it wont last 400k miles,mine was a ranger xlt ac,cruise control intermittent windshield wipers,and power windows arm powered window cranks but they worked forever
Truck gang!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is some funny shit!
Love ya Ginger Billy. You're dam funny man
Thing is they’re both great trucks and each side has great points 😂
I like how at 3:10 the basically says "I'm about done with this BS"
I'm surprised a small Weiner joke didn't get thrown in
Need to take those gay assed step and handle off that old Ford and grab the steering wheel like a real man, lol. Definitely want those rims for my lifted 74 Highboy though!! Nice truck!! The old one that is!!
Amused.  I own an ‘82 Bronco.  EVERYTHING IS TRUE.  Especially the rust hole on the driver’s side door for spittin’ your Copenhagen through.  XD
I own a 86 Nissan 720 I’m 16 Mine is rather low to the ground it’s nice now but it was a real pos months ago
Ha ha ....I learned a bunch of new insults for my buddies that drive new trucks !  The one I use now is "That's a pretty truck, truck like that you wash and wax every weekend"
I'm on the old man's side
Awsome lol👍when America was America
The geezer is my spirit animal.✨💜
He needs nerf bars like no1s business
So many old truck lovers in the comments. I always slow down to pass them in the desert and see them with their windows down sweatin balls, breaking their necks bouncing around at 10 mph. I wave, then get it back up to 60+ with my ventilated seats cranked coolin my taint while I listen to my spotify playlist on carplay. When I get done shooting I head back and DON'T stop at the gas station because I've got a 500+ mile range even with 450 HP. Team new truck! ;)
The rust bucket is better.
Ginger come to clapper bro
I’m with the old guy
Every time I say I ain't watching another one of these stupid videos, here I am again watching and loving them🤣
New trucks look like they're made for trophy wives though, the king ranch interior is like a  giant purse
oh hay he has a actual F 350 dually  xD
That Ford has way more metal left in it than my 03 gmc 2500.
3:08 What the dog doing?
Imma go buy me a truck now
“Why would Russian hackers hack into my truck?!…” 😂😂
The Pantydropper 2000 versus the Pantydropper 1000...girls?
Good video
You're videos always put a smile on my face even when I'm having the worse possible day because they are funny as hell! I love when you play multiple characters! You are my favorite comedian so keep up the good work brother!
Hilarious brother 🤣 thanks for the laughs
Paid for and runs, that’s all that counts.
Might be joining the truck gang here soon!!
I want both of these trucks
im a big fan of both trucks (tho now its more the square body pickup vs the f35hunnerd
Old man is right about them wheels
That old 78-79 is pretty cool!  The new trucks are super nice but the prices are insane.  I'll stick with my old truck.
That F350 was bad.
I prefer the old bucket its the best then that new one eewww
Lol A'Merriiiiicaaaa dammit!!
I just don't like new cars for some reason. I've tried to get into them, I just find them all ugly
Must have been filmed in Mississippi
Coming from someone who has a 2019 Tundra, you know modern. That classic Ford is sick! 🤠👍
i like the old truck more oh that sound that sound is amazing
My heated seat is just an exhaust leak under my cab
Only short ported boys are still scared of the the old school trucks or why would you try and make fun of them ?? You know deep down they have less electronics but they can be adapted to kick any New body's ass !!!
I would take that 78 any day of the week in fact I would take that f350 just so I could sell it and build me two more of those real trucks I want people to know that I have a good time and every one of thes dents tells a story
The 78-79 f series fords are my favorite
It's all fun and games until they see their power stroke getting spanked at a tug of truck by a gas engine
Translation: Ginger Billy is just flexing his trucks.
0:34 Careful how you say that name
As an owner of a new 19 ranger with a boomer parent with a 90s ranger, can confirm this true. Lol
I prefer the old truck it’s cooler
F3shitty.
Did you know if you own a 2003 or newer it is relaying personal information to the government like weight and how you drive.
I'd take either one, the dually to tow my work trailer and the monster to go muddin' in.
Fyi I was unsubscribed I just resubscribe
TRUCK GANG!!!🤟🤟🤟🤟
I love your videos please keep them coming please!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I needed that 🤣🤣🤣
yes/yes 👍
Tupperware trucks, all these new trucks are, plastic recyclable trash  BTw that stuffing under the overalls is a bit high, you look more like a lunch lady than a fat guy
Love those dent side ford's, nothing better.
Russian hackers! Lol   These vids always have me in tears
Nice work GB! You always cheer me up. Priceless these days in xidens Amerika.
I'd rather have the old truck
Love that 79
Just like red and green show
Truck Gang, oh yeah.  Great video Ginger Billy!
Merica!
They circled the problem right on the grill..
“Fresh shoes”
God i love my 76 chevy shortbed lol.
I have an 86 f150 with an efi 302, and it sounds exactly like that, true duels with no cats and a flowmaster 40 for each pipe
I’d love to have that dent side, and I have a new Super Duty, love the old trucks too…
Both are beautiful! But that classic!!!!
Thanks
Gitchu a dooly truck!
I'll take the old truck all day long.
I was classic truck guy at 16. Once you go old, you got the gold.
Back when vehicles were made right. 1950's: Drive vehicle into a BRICK wall and still make it home for dinner after stopping at the store.... 2020's: Drive vehicle into a FOAM wall and the car acts like a soccer player going for gold....
I'll take the mud bucket on swampers anyday over those wuss hauler stretch dolly trucks. Unless i was haulin a fifth wheel, then I'd have one of those in a dodge. But i would want classic Alco's not the new car wheels they are putting on em now days.
Merica!     Let’s Go Brandon!
I like that they're both annoying. Real accurate.
Love it Ginger actually I love that old truck the best and computers and it runs a carby  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I bet that dog was like “who is he talking to?”
Not gonna lie I like the classic one better
that squarebody is the origional good truck
Old man smoked em
Billy, how 'bout a new series where you critique viewers trucks from photos they send you. Allow them in Truck Gang if they pass the muster... ☺
Old school all day ! Obs !
Lol "did it come with a bottle and viagra and a walker!" Ha had my dying laughing 😅
Mans legendary beard
My only fight in this is, them new trucks won't be worth much in 25 years. My 30 yr old truck will go literally forever.
That classic was badass
So nobody’s gonna point out the ford had Chevy axles 🤔🤔🤔👀
This is me in my '89 Bronco
It's common knowledge that oldies are the best
TG
Sounds like you were in the same parking lot as me...heard the same convo at tractor supply a few days ago....2 mins inside getting  something 20 mins in the parking lot listening to basically  the same words....I'm  💀 always  hilarious, Ginger Billy does it again
I Like the old one more 🤣😂.
I like the old one
U left yer dog
As of right now, it’s at 666k views
1:58 - Did you take those wheels off your Snapper lawn mower? HAHAHHAHAHA!!!
Yup, those there little vent windows was the real good old jet AC. Twist those suckers around and whoopee. Of course that's when it was good clean air. But those old trucks took a beating and kept on going. And top that, you could change your own spark plugs etc. Oh yea, they were MAN MADE, Not computer machine made. American jobs, MADE in good old USA.
Honestly old trucks look better and feel better my dream truck is an 88 f250 built pretty much like how he had his
dude hits traps everyday 😆
The old trucks come with de-luxe ash tray and cigarette lighter! let's see your new truck's ash tray and cigarette lighter?
I’ll take old
What's the Truck version of a Fudd?
Whats funny is my 2020 Tacoma is just as big as a 90s f350. And factory is higher off the ground then it is too.
Il take that real steel any day....aint no Russian hackers getting me...!!
Its the old f-truck for me. Those new electric controlled gizmos are trouble waiting to happen for a real man turning soft.   From the NT of Australia, where trucks have four full sized trailers and bull bars.
Man my wheels are a 73 model F100 with a 351 Cleveland and I love it I  use it every day for service work and is merican engineering from Australia love the USA.
Lol I used to spit my Copenhagen through the rust hole in the bottom of my old truck 😆
I'd recognize that door squeak blind folded
The old truck has 2X60 AC. 2 windows down 60 MPH.
I used to have a classic shit box like that, I couldn’t afford the gas and we didn’t have the stuff to repair it so we had to sell it unfortunately
Would love to see some vlogs and behind the scenes of some of these wild builds , just saying , #truckgang
Ah, the 70s Ford! 🤩🤩🇺🇲🇺🇸
We all know what the sensible us wants and what the man in us wants
Id rather have a badass  Carbureted truck then then any of this new shit they're coming out with To be honest
Truck Gang !
My grandpa always said lifting trucks is for suburban cowboys. Guys that wear boots and hats but never use their trucks for work.
I wanna 1997 lifted white dually f350. 🤤
Yo I took a picture with you at a water park like a couple mounths ago and I love your content
Old f100 needs a set of gears to turn them big ass tires
Truck gang 😂
Accurate..lol
🤣🤣
I’ll take one of each of those trucks
Russian hackers lol pretty funny but I like the old one better
I move hay in a 88 ford 250 with the 460 in it every two weeks. It's the best. Truck GANG! Man I want that mickey Thomson set up .
Merica!  Luv the enhanced beer belly!
That Rust Bucket is way cooler then that new shit
I can relate to both these dude's... since I own a 21 year old ranger and a 20 year old infinity I came down on the side of my bank account. Retirement is coming up dontcha know?
I wish there wasn't any credit in America & people had to earn what they have up front. There would be a lot less uppity pricks that think there shit doesn't stink that's for sure. I hate these shitards that think because they have a new vehicle they're better than the rest of the free world, while living in a mobile home.
This was a funny video and I loved it so I shared it
Lol I agree.. sick of lil boys and their mall crawlers.
Don't care, I'd rather have the old one......
lol i fuckin love you billy
Ginger Billy for President
The best thing about old trucks is no payments lol
the dog looked like he got sucked into the wheels
For a minute, I thought I was back home
I would buy one of those old trucks since I'd prefer that to new but the prices keep getting closer 😞
This is just so Waffle House
ok hahhahaahhaah lol
Then a rusty mini-truck rolls by carrying all the stuff they ain't.
When the fanny car breaks down, You can’t fix anything ! Who you gonna call that ain’t gonna rip you off to fix your fanny car?.  People get lazy in the head when there’s too much computers in the car that’s doing everything for you. I laugh at my neighbors when they come to me for help when the fanny car is stuck or needs to charge up when there’s no electricity😂.  No No ain’t touching that virus. Great video It made me laugh good, thanks.  Stay safe and enjoy the freedom
I'll take the rust bucket over a new truck any day!!!! Absolutely a work of art! Clean and simple!
A truck or a Hilton😂😂😂😂😂
Truck gang
40+ years and the old truck is still running… Where will that piece of crap Dooley be in 40 years
Outside the classic kicks ass... inside new all the way...  Can we combine da 2.!!
One things for sure, i doubt youll see that f-350 on the road 40 years from now. So much cheap shit on those trucks and the aluminum body panels dont hold their shape when you push those trucks limits. My brothers doors damn near rattle open when he drives it on a dirt road. That stupid plastic on the tailgate gets snagged by the first 2x4 that slides on it popping it off. They are nice trucks but feel cheap as hell
Both trucks was beautiful
"And I can spit my Copenhagen through there" that is freaking hilarious
I got a winder LMFAO.
That's a sweet shortbed.
Count me in the freezer class. In fact I am so geezer I would go with a 2wd with factory wheels and suspension.
New title: who's compensating the most
Lost my glasses and my shoes out of my 1967 firebird ventilation holes. 😝. Good times
Im restoring a 79 F150 4x4. So loved seeing one like mine.
Not gonna lie both trucks look awesome and I'd gladly drive either one.
I mean, both are accurate 😂
Does the "new age" f350 have a heated tailgate so his hands don't freeze as he's pushing it home in the winter?
He didn't spin the tires as much as the new truck at the end. That's because if he was hitting the gas any harder the earth would start rotating backwards
I just bought an 88 Burban the other day I cant wait to make fun of computer ran cars with A/C
Notice how they were both fords, yes sir
I hate all those new rims good ol mt and the super swampers.lol that was really funny
What about middle age trucks from the 90s and 20s, the 03 cateye chevy is the goat
Pretty close to true!
Jesus,this guy sucks. But no,I wouldn't say it to his face.
What rust bucket that thing is gorgeous
The old fords when built strong are way stronger than ANY new truck.  Heavy duty military front end put in and huge strong Axel's and lockers.  The old Ford's and Chevy are stronger than the new ones in every way really.  Also we can do Allmost all the work ourself.  No computer chips are relays or senseless and no sense smog  control   just plain old 3" headers and muffler.      Old school big block torque.     The new trucks are plastic and so many parts made in china.    Cheap made ..
Can I buy the 79?
Didn't ch'all figure it out... it's the same guy in a disguise.
TRUCK GANG
Woulda been funny if the dude in the rust bucket had been outta gas when he went to drive away lol
That's pretty much how the argument goes!
That ford is trash it ain’t got nothen against that Chevy that ford is a waste of money.
Me and my grandfather have recently started work on a 68 international scout and a 53 dodge pickup we got them both running
I gotta say that old school is where it's at. Or new school without all the over engineered electronics.
I sure do miss my '79 Bronco with 33s. I pull started a dump truck with that puppy one day. Four speed tall shifter, and once you go outside to lock the front axle, four low will pull stumps. I saw a resto modded '79 with a coyote and trans, but the rest of the drive train was pretty much stock. At Mecum's Auction it went for $125K. The paint job was great, but the colors weren't. $125K?!
WD55 In them old trucks. Window down at 55 mph. All the AC you need.
Idk what all the fuss is about, both are Ford.... 😉 All jks, aside... I'd choose the Bronco everytime over that new fancy pants F350 lol
98' Dodge Magnum!! When Amurica was Amurica!!!!! Amen!!!!!
I would take that classic any day of the week!
As a person sitting in India, who's only exposure to American Midwest are movies, TV, News & Gus Johnson; I'm throughly confused as to whether this is satire or just a documentary.  BTW, absolutely love those old trucks you guys have got over there.
Old land boat owners vs new land boat owners:    Source: I own a land boat
I must be in that imaginary line of age that I just say ....yes please
My dream truck is a chevy square body don't care witch year just would be happy to own one
I’ll take a Chevy…
ALL THE COMPANIES BRAG ABOUT THEIR ENGINES AND DRIVE TRANE . THE SUSPENSION , HOW LONG IT WILL LAST ....... THAT'S NOT WHAT LETS YOU DOWN  . IT'S THE COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS.
That squarebody is fucking perfection and it has my favorite rim style. damn dude.
All my tucks got mud grips on em
First things first...I love that old brown Ford.
"TRUCK GANG" ....BRRRBRBRBRBRBRBBBBRRRRRRRR
Fucked 350 times a year
Lol... wonderful  presentation on the two truck  , an both those trucks  are GROWN  DAMM MEN TRUCKS!!!
Truck gang!
I love the short bed dentside. What lift you got ? I know stuperlift,and a few others that carry the 9" coil suspension lift. Then he must have a 3" body lift. But that only comes to 12" of lift. So I'm curious, where does the extra 3" come from?😲😄😕😉
My life’s goal is to buy a house next to Ginger Billy and watch him make all these videos!!
Freaking hilarious bro
Never seen this guy before. Funny video and two Awesome Trucks. I need 'Likes', please.
I love my old truck
Although I’m old school truck all the way, new or old, we’re all truck gang. 🇺🇸 (Except Honda Ridgeline)
I'll take the rust bucket every time. When she breaks chances are I can fix her 😁
Old truck all day 🤣
Lol 😂 Hilarious 😂😆🤣🤣🤣
Fords
take the truck mudding
S
That's what Ginger Billy looks like with a shirt on.
I rather prefer a rust bucket than a city boy truck any day!
This guy have both of my dream Trucks,I feel like they both making fun of me at the same time lol
This was pure comedy 😂
I had one similar to that older brown one when I lived in Alaska with the 44"super swampers. Best truck I ever owned and sorry I sold it. If I could ever find another, 77' or 79', I'd buy it in a heartbeat!
So true Billy 🤣🤣🤣
Goin' to drink coffee down at the Hardee's! I'm almost there. Gimme some of those Hash-Rounds!
Boys boys they are both very very very great trucks that I love
I'd rather drive that old model truck. Less chinese made shit electronics in it.
"Hit your life alert" HAHAHA!
I love this guy
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly I would take the old truck before the new one lol.
Brilliant. And hilarious. 😁👍
This comment section is funny af
The older one is better. I could jump in there fassst tho. I love this man. Good humour. Please collab with Larry the cable guy😭😭😭😭
2:26😂😂😂😂⚰️⚰️⚰️🤟 real men😂😂😂
I have the old 7.3 idi diesel and my buddy has that new 6.7 he talks alot of smack about how mine is to slow and old....but he later regreted it when his truck spent more time at the dealer when mine is still running strong....he ended up buying one for him self and he is real happy with it
"Ah got a winder"
There’s a 76 Ford F-250 4x4 sitting in Baja waiting for me to Restore
Meet me down at the parts store, fancy pants. When that VGT turbo hand grenades, you'll be at the dealership spending more money than a complete long block 7.3 powerstroke costs! And...for the sticker price of a new truck, i could buy a half dozen mint condition used trucks and have vehicles and parts for the next fifty years! My two 7.3 powerstroke have a combined 600,000 miles on them and run like a buttfucked monkey every day! The new trucks can barely make to town and back without getting towed or recalled!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
TRUCK GANG@!
When I was in college I had a Chevy short bed with 44in groundhogs my friends used to fall out of it all the time LOL
You could strip that ‘79 to bare bones, rebuild it ground up, upgrade everything and have a better truck for less money.
TRUCK GANG!!!😎
I gotta say, "I have enjoyed my old FORD trucks" the best and still do. First vehicle: 1953 F100.  I've had now for 41 years.  Flathead.  Love it. 1962 F100 Unibed.  I've had it for 3 years. 1989 F350 7.3.  One month and love it. If course, I had other FORD trucks but, nothing newer than 2008.  Give me old school vent windows.  Simple to work on.....and CHEAPER!  They aren't as smooth or comfy as a new one but, I like them better.  I've noticed they garner more appreciation from on-lookers. People seem to really dig old school.
I’m 16 but I like the old truck
Older is better easier to work on and don't need to have parts specifically tuned to the brain for em to work
Ford Is Crap
Wanna sell that “rust bucket”
TRUCK GANG!
Did u stop before the 🐕 got..? besides that 👍🥴
Well the 44s and that truck would be a perfect mud truck, the otherone perfect for daily towing
Lol my 86 K20 has Heat, cruise, and working A/C. Love this video 🤣
MURICA!!!
I ain't gonna lie I would pick the old truck any day in any condition I have new and old vehicles and old ones are way more reliable
Old vehicles, are the best.
I would take the old one with the new ones tech.
That's a bad ass truck can't beat the way those 44s look on those 15 rims
Love my classic F-SERIES
I’ll take the 44s anytime.
I agree old trucks look better and are easier to work on. None of that computer crap. Ginger Billy never disappoints
When America was America...Gotta love billy! 🇺🇸🗽
Lol the truck it’s not run by the computers you can’t take that off and it will still work like stop smack talking the new ones
This video was on point. Keep it in America I still have my 1989 Ford full-size bronco XLT!
I would love to have you the one of those trucks......
When the old truck wend WHURRRRRRRR, Me and my 81 d150 felt it
I'm old school all the way
I used to have a 1978 F-100 same body style as the old truck in this video. It didn’t have A/C but the heat would roast you in the winter.
“I’m gonna go drink coffee at the Hardee’s”  Everyone who owns a lifted truck over the age of 50 felt that.
I only buy classic trucks. I've had a 77 ford econoline, a 77 gladiator, a 79 dodge dually diesel, an 85 S10 flatbed dually (very rare 1 ton small truck), an 87 comanche eliminator, an 88 ranger (modified baja suspension with a 2.3 4cylinder), a 00 Dakota with a 5.2/318 V8
I got am 05 excursion xlt 6.8l v10 on a 4".5 lift. Want to go up to 8.5" I got heated leather.. ac.. I'm 50/50 on the fence here lol But at the same time so glad don't have a bunch on computers in my truck. So much easier to work on lol
This is just like my dad and me, except reversed roles 😂
What's funny is you can put anything that's new into those trucks
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t get enough of these videos, love you Billy! Keep posting
I hate new trucks , have a 87 ramcharger , it has ac and power windows and aloft with real tires that actually fit the truck! I hate new trucks !
Needed Ricky Berwick in the passenger seat...
😅🤣😂🤣😅🤣
Everyone says they would take the classic "any day of the week" but we all know given the opportunity every one of u would choose the knew dully 😂😂😂 one 8k (only bc of the rubber and lift) and one is upward of 70-90k we all know the old one is easy to work on but not one of u would actually choose it over the knew dully if you had a choose to get either one for free we would all choose the new one🤷 that's not to say rust buckets arnt nostalgic af we all love em but I'm just saying.
I find the classic truck more appealing. They just look like raw power to me for some reason. Something about the body style and the simplicity of older vehicles. I actually prefer the hand crank windows too considering my horrible luck with power windows.
Back when America was America. So true.
"...you can park it under my truck..." That was perfection.
Why would Russian hackers hack into my truck?😂😂😂😂😭😭
Just a note, that engine is likely a 460 😎  Old school ain't no hilton 😎
Old school truck 12volts…either runs or it don’t  New truck 83k$ and 1200ft/p torque…. Made from recycled left handed lawnmowers and Hillary Clinton’s vibrator speed controller.
Makes me wanna go muddin’ 😂
Wife said it before I could...only one thing wrong in this video...all that 'FORD' obscenity flashed around like dresses and fingernail polish...
hook em up!
Good lord this sounds like me and my old man because he drives ford and I drive chevy and in the end that man is a tough son of a biscuit 🤬 that taught me and my two little brothers everything he knew and he was born dust dirt poor  Thank you Billy appreciate this reminder  TRUCK 🛻 GANG
EFF TREE FIDDY!!!
Legit,  funny as always, keep it up bro
Honestly I perfer the classic trucks the just look better to me
God i wish I had an old Ford like that
He does have a point. They could use it as a weapon. Food for thought
Love your comedy man but how about some workout videos.
Rust buckets are my favorite
Screams about F350. Truck magically swings around
I love how his idea of an old truck is just an older pickup with massive fucking wheels XD
Lol I got 2 77s a high boy and a f150 and a 55 f250 with a hydraulic stepside dump bed new trucks suck
That truck was certainly made when america was still america tho lol
Shit, I'd take any truck.
Now that's a truck hoss
I'll take the 'Neck Truck over the New Truck any day. It has character and knows how things are supposed to work.🤣
Neither of those are trucks because they are Fords!!! Chevy and Yota, those are trucks by gawd!!!
hey at least he had ford trucks and nuthin else 😆
My wife's 7.3 is better than both
I just wish it had ended with each of them saying “that guy does have a cool truck though” to themselves as they drove away.
Gin and juice!
It is genius that he can write, produce and publish this material, should have given himself a little step ladder to settle the dispute.
😂
Will take a classic truck over a newer  choke and puke any day .
I love both trucks, I love diesel dually 4x4s, however I loved them 70 somethin Fords before I ever remember seein a 4x4 diesel dually, and that old Ford has the right wheel and tire setup for a lifted truck. Ain't no 20"+ rims with little rubberband m/ts she's got 15s with a lot of rubber around em the way it should be
Hilarious
Your videos are awesome, I needed a good laugh. TRUCK GANG
This is so relatable to me
He just wanted to brag about his awesome trucks lol I would too
So true.. especially the ventilation holes!! 🤣🤣🤣
GINGER BILLY FOR PRESIDENT
It's a classic 4 sure.. but I'm definitely taken the 350 over the 70s ford
That old 79 I waaaaay better!!
you didn’t even get an FX4 for your dually
🤣🤣
I’m glad I’ve got an old 93 f 150 as my first truck. Bit of old and new mixed in. My favorite thing in the world is the availability of parts.
I give a testicle for that '78 tho...
Its just one guy trying to justify owning 2 trucks.
I struggle to decide what truck I love more, my old 77 short bed or my 06 crew cab. I just leave them both broke down until I figure it out.
2-80-AC
Jajaja
Both fords any way
I have a truck just like that anybody want to help me remodel it??
Haha. You are a classic mate. 👍🦘
I so want that old truck that’s nice af
Truck Gang
What if I am both?
I bought a used Freightliner FLD 120 with a full condo sleeper. $17k cash. Traded the third tag axle for a 18 ft. diamond plate aluminum flat bed and a big ol wing. Registered as a motorhome now, so no DOT or weigh station issues and my girlfriend can drive it without a CDL. Cat power pulls pretty good, and queen sized bed is sure comfy. What's decent F350 cost these days?
LOL.... Every time I watch you I die of laughter.... you are a REAL AMERICAN COMEDIAN!!!  I love watching you bud. GREAT JOB ON YOUR VIDEOS 📹 👏 👍 👌
Give me the Mikey with swampers!
Good work.
Truck Gang!
Ginger Billy always makes you laugh
Classic Truck > Modern Truck
Ok someone has to say it 🙄 Boy you got to stop arguing with yourself people are thinking you losing it . Lol 😆🤣😂😹 #truckgang God bless
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. Romans 12:21 God bless you 😇 🙏
Lmao. Nail polish and a dress. Lmao
Your content is hilarious man. Ive been driving all over town in my little ford ranger saying truck gang everywhere.
That asphalt queen ain't ever seen dirt.
the wheels on the new truck were put on there by an expert who went to engineering school and carefully worked out precisely what kind of tire to put on meanwhile whoever put on the big wheels on the old truck may have been as drunk as one of those old walking robots https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb93Z0QItVI (this video took awhile to find u better appreciate it)
I like that single cab on 40's!!!!
Big Block Crew……….ASSEMBLE!  🇺🇸💪
Sxt doesn’t have heated seats, someone correct me I’m not 100%
😂🤣😅😆😅
Fun Fact: 429 cubic inches is roughly 7 liters
Gimme the old truck. I really don't care about a 115v cabin outlet. I care about it driving and not needing service.
I’m partial to the old American made steel truck. 👍😎🇺🇸 Hilarious video! 🤣
Drink coffee at the Hardee's! Lol 😆 that has got to be every small town in the south 🤣
"truck gang" haha your stuff never gets old! I love it! I was born in Texas, raised in Iowa, not a country man, but sure do love the country and alot of what it offers haha and Billy offers alot of wonderful country/hillbilly videos haha
I got me one of those 6 cylinder f350, but sure miss big byrd 76 rollin on 37,s all gears would roast em all the way to 90 and it was over 4mpg
It’s F-Tree-Fitty. Get it right.
Ginger cracks my shit up lol
Amurican Built Ford Dentside
Who else noticed that the old truck has mitch match tires
I actually love them both!
Boys and their toys. 😄
I want your heeler
I'd take an old truck over new any day of the week.
I drive a 64 C10 every day. Love it. Awesome video. Wing windows and the feel of an old thin steering wheel with the little nibs on the back  can't be beat. A pair of cherry bombs rumbling at 2500 rpm is nice too.
Brilliant ginger Billy makes the day go by 💪💯😂🤣
That 78 is bad as hell. Big block on Boggers is the ultimate.
I miss my 79. It did have a 429, lol. 4 in the floor, and a fifth under the seat...
F350? Well there is your problem.  You should have spent your money better
What new trucks?  They need microchips to run.
Don't forget the most important feature of the old trucks... The ball chiller
Heard that old Ford window down squeak. Felt it in my bones.
Still hoping truck gang sticker's will be coming
Ginger belly
Truck gang LOL, Love It !!!
TG
Its gotta 15 inch lift so you can park your truck under mine1😂😂😂
That purple truck was made when trucks were still made in America  ford ranger is most american made new truck it's like 75-80% american   I gotta primer 76 f100 4x4 on mt's
Both are good trucks but i like the old one the best. 👍👍💯
I must be a geezer.  I’d take that ‘79 on 44’s all day over the Hilton on wheels…tho it’s a nice dually; if they ever get those 6.0 oil burners to live longer.  I want a 79 F350 crew cab with a 7.3 swapped in
Trucks made in the 70s are still in use today. Trucks made in the 00s are sitting in mechanic shops across the country.
I’d take my Cummins over any Ford any day
Lol 😂 priceless
Best part is hes arguing with himself.
This is so funny. Keep up the great work.
My grandpa had an f250 that he made look just like Bigfoot just with 44 gumbo swamp tires(got in trouble with 48). I’d love to try and rebuild one to match it but finding what I want to do so is gonna take some time
ill take that 429 any day...
Almost 1 mill subs billy!!!! Keep her goin can’t wait for it congrats
Hahahaha so true
I love the old Ford highboys, had a 76 f250 highboy with 44 inch mickey tires, I watch the video of it and regret selling it. New ones are nice but I'll take an old ford any day, the taller the better, and has to be a manual
I prefer the old Ford any day anytime...
Truck Gang!!!!! 👆 👈
Haha good one. That the way I get in my truck to haha.
I got a F-3 fitty too, it happens to be a 79 though😂
"forty fours rollin down the dusty ol dirt road"...
...and THAT'S why Ginger Billy is so cool! Notice they were FORD trucks? 😎
That bronco is cooler then you'll ever be! .
Always loved the look of the little rims with big tires.
🤣why he kick his leg back when he said super swamper wheels😭😭😭
Truck gang
Your giving me awful ideas for my 59 250 😂😂😂
my daily driver is a 1991 s10 and it has a distributor instead of coli packs but i sure wish it had vent windows. even the 1996 f150's had those.
This is hilarious. But honestly, all those computers and software helps to create more efficient engine, making more power for each unit of fuel, easier to warm up, and less maintenance. Remember when you had to warm them old vehicles for 10 minutes and even put a stick on thr pedela to Rev up the engine? Now you aren't supposed to do that. Give it 30 seconds to pump thr oil up to th5 engine and put it into gear. Drive easy for 5 minutes and you're good. Remember when you would spend a nice Saturday with the hood up to tune it up every 30,000 miles? Adjusting thr e ginr speed, timing the engine with a strong gun? Replacing sparkplug? Or trying to get another 10,000 miles out of sparkplug with a spark plug sand blaster? No one does that now. Coolants last 150,000 miles. Sparkplugs on gas engines last 150,000 miles. The engine is computer regulated compensating for altitude, fuel mixture, temperature, and driving patterns. So modern vehicles are better in everyday except for when its to go to thr mechanic who is now more computer diagnostic isn't than wrench turner.
That Ol Ford is BA😎
I loved this one 😅🤣👍
I know my Swampers too well I knew those were 44-inch Groundhog's the minute I saw them I had a set of those on my Ramcharger
Point of these storie : real man can disagree but after they walk away they can still offer a hand to one another.
There's nothing more beautiful than a B Block on some good old 44-inch groundhogs I wish they still made those good tires
I was rolling watching this. You just gained another subscriber.
Almost 1M subs
"I can spit my Copenhagen down there" lmao
I cant stand it when a farm dog chases the truck tires
The short bed is a cocky little truck.
All jokes aside, 44's on 15's got me chubbed.
Unfortunately Ford isn't what they used to be 20 years ago I bought a dodge now I'm not at the shop every other week, getting something fixed
Watched this video cause there is snow on the ground here.
Man, gotta go with the classic. Made of solid 'Murica Steel. I look at the new one and all I see are bills. Cuz if you can't afford it in one go, you're gonna be paying it for a good while. Add to that, any repairs you may need down the road if anything electronic fails, and any body damage you're gonna get cuz Y'know, it's a work truck. Not like you'd buy a Pickup truck just for show amirite.
Sign me up for the old Ford.❤
I reckon I'm getting old....
Doesn't matter WHY they would hack into my truck, they COULD! lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣
What does he say at 3:45? Truck... it made me laugh but I can’t hear the part after truck.
“I don’t have to worry about no Russians hacking into my truck” Merica! “Is this a truck or a Hilton hotel?” 😂
For real i love the ford truck series. Beat damn trucks ever . Old or new their built awesome
Man! I had a 1976 XLT short wheelbase with a 390 in it. It had red white and blue inside the XLT inblem on the left lower corner of the glove box. Red vinayl seats red carpet,  built like a tank. Aluminum trim along the upper body line. Also along the bottom.. That was about 35 years ago .. That's the only truck I wished I had not gotten rid off..  Nothing like a big truck with 44 swampers!!
If I won a new truck id sell it and build up an old one, keep the excess money and that old truck'l be perfect and it'll be perfect for a million more miles with real basic maintenance until it gets a fairly simple rebuild again then runs another million miles.
Why do I feel like you own both of these?
Of course a Ginger drives a Fird
Power stroke built by international put in a ford hows that
This was pure gold
I don't usually drive fords unless it's a worktruck for the company. But I would raise some hell in that old body Furd
.....I got both ....a 06 ford diesel and a 91 gmc suburban.....its on 40s
The 6.7 is a big block the powerstroke are all bigblocks (American lineup) 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Classic Truck has the 255 AC...2 windows down 55mph
Now I wait till I see the right person at the stop light and throw out a truck gang!
I have an Lariat ultimate 450 and hate it. I have turned everything off including the gps maps that kidnap the radio screen.
its true , the 70s Ford is an American truck.
That is one strong steering wheel
Windar 😂☠️
damn.....im the old guy🤣
Big V8, 4 wheel drive, manual transmission, crank windows, and vinyl floors is all a real man needs...
Would take the big block on Boggers any day of the week🔥. “This was built when America was AMERICA!” More true words have never been spoken. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Best bore and stroke a 460 for that classic
This video is a masterpiece! Had a good laugh And  learned what those holes in the floorboard was for.
Fuels is ugly
Need a damn ladder to get out of lifted trucks old or new
A classic truck like gat right dur, makes ‘at dually look weak
take at old school truck any day!
I'd like to see them put to the test I know that old truck whoop that new truck
When he put on the a/c on the truck (rolled down window) reminiscing of the Red Green show
That's 💯😎 " this truck was built back when this was America " 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 well said my friend.
Personally I would much rather have that classic lifted F150. Well I’m biased as I have a 1972 F250 4x4 with a 429 power plant
Anyone notice the pillow he stuffed in his shirt.😂
I now have a new argument as to why old is better😂😂….I’ll take the simple 70’s anyday
Holy hell... He wore a shirt in a video!
Knock knock.
Would be hilarious to see him filming this in the Middle of a field.
I vote classic
Merica!!!!!!!!!!!
There's no school like old school.
I love how their the same brand
Both are Fords. Both will be broke down in 10 miles.
There’s no way in hell that I would ever buy a new truck and spend $70,000 even if I had $70,000. I have a 1974 F350 I will never sell.🇺🇸🛠🇺🇸
Love that 79, be better if it were a long bed tho
4 door truck is a minivan truck.
Forgot the part that the new truck cost about as much as a decent house and you gotta pay about twice as much for work done on them because they're engineered to where average people can't work on them without a computer!
I'm pissed I missed ya when you can to Wisconsin. I had to work. Next time man. Until then keep it up.
Ha
I'd much rather drive that old rig than the new piece of junk.  Wing windows are the best. My 87 4runner has em. And the top comes off. Also all the cheap plastic in newer vehicles is trash. You breathe wrong removing a panel and half the clips explode off.
He got a 2-60 air conditioner 2 winders down going 60 mph!!!
How are you always sun burnt?....isn't there winter?
That dentside lookin fuckin badass
F.O.R.D. = F*cked Over Rebuilt Dodge.  America, F*ck Yeah!
Russian hackers 😄 🤣
Them theres my ventilation holes
Truck gang!
When america was Merica! Hell yea
I'm a mix of both like new but respect old to
79 f250 for the win.
That 429 better than that powerless joke
I'll take that 79 over that electronic smogged out pile of crap any day of the week !! .  New truck's suck!!🪦👎 Doesn't matter what brand either...
Y’all missed the most important thing haha 😂 that’s a damn Fucked Over Rebuilt Dodge!! It’s really too bad you didn’t spend the extra money and get quality over quantity, shoulda bought yourself a real truck with a tried and true transmission and a powerhouse under the hood like the Chevrolet Duramax with the 6.6 and an Allison!!
I wish I had a truck
That F-350 your new whip?
Ol Hoss ..... IS CRAZY !! 😆 🤣 😂  Take the Old Ford Anyday. Great Job Hoss.
I love the classic trucks 🛻!!!!!
loved hardee's and i love the old ferd...
Ohhhhhhhhh man I love it
I mean my 21 f250 has a 445ci big block so we could have stopped that argument there 🤣🤣.
Hey Ginger, I'd really rather have that 78 1/2 or 79 F-150.
Older is better though
Love this video only because im in the market for one of those trucks and billy  im sold the obs wins
I love the 15"rim with whole lotta rubber around it.
Russians do hack ford operating systems. You can change all kinds of stuff in the sync with thier app.
Does he have the ron beer car tatted in his left arm?
🤣
Love Dentsides
Love this, and Yep I’ll take the old Ford any day I’ve had the new ones also I’m looking for me a ,old one right now
Ford man....you know hes a wise man
That big block sounds demonic... actually the whole truck is
I'm a be "TRUCK GANG!" one day.
Can't do it
Old billy should just monster truck young Billy's tiny little truck as all things should be
Anyone else notice the brown one has 6 bolt wheels?
70’s Ford’s had the best body style of them all.
My van has A.C. but crank windows and manual seats.  No leather, it's too hot and too cold.  I don't want a new car, I hate all the electronics.
Are you in south Mississippi? "Drinking coffee at the hardee's", sounds like it.
No entendí nada 🤣🤣🤣🤣
In 2021 it's still okay to advocate genocide for gingers
Is that whistlindesils f-350
when you showed the "ac" in the ol ford you should of opened the triangle windows. Them were the best!
Got both love both
I've been in both camps
🤣😂😂😂 lmao I can spit my Copenhagen through there. Hit your life alert if you need help. 🤣 🤣😂
🤣🤣😂😂
TRUCKGANG
Winder... hahaha got me good 👍 🤣
My uncle,  baby uncle on my dad's side.  He built monster trucks.  They scared me when I was little.
Yeah dude that "rustbucket" is sick! 429 Baby!!
I'd rather have a classic truck. They look better in my opinion.
I take the square body over that fancy pos any day.
Badass truck
I want that old,lifted Ford.
How many vehicles do you own?!?
🤣🤣 only in Merica
People fail to realize. The old Ford is the reason the new one is here!
Sounds like me your fancy smancy truck that truck was made when america was america
I love it brother
I roll down my winder🤣😂😁
Where u get them wheels from snoop diggity dog lmao😂😂
A bottle of Viagra and a walker?!?!? Hahahaha!
Ok but everyone in the comments section would love that old ford
This reminds me of my Dad and my uncle every time they got together.  Now they both have passed but this video reminded me of that and i thank you.  you just made my day :)
A truck is a truck is a truck, and we shouldn't discriminate....unless it's a Ridgeline, lol. #TRUCKGANG
You got 2-45 Ac in there...2 windows down 45mph
Alsome Video 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Love your videos man your hilarious
This is a confusing mating ritual
🤣🤣🤣
Ginger Billy never disappoints
Old ford pickups are awesome and scream AMERICA!! But so did that 6.7 powerstroke!
I can fix my old geezer truck with basic tools on the side of the road. No tow needed. Oil, gas, and a road are the only things my truck require, and the road is optional. Lol funny video though.
Thanks👍 believe in God, Jesus and Holy Spirit.Hillbilly-Buckeye- Rampman out💪😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
"SnoOp DIgGiTy DoG"
I got a 1991 7.3 international diesel it don't gotta computer my injectors only cost for 20 bucks😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ginger Billy do you like the classics more than the new trucks or do you just say a truck is a truck at the end of the day?
Just imagine that in real life 😂
What's up
your hot
I love the 6.7 but you can't beat those old girls, no electronics you just have to keep replacing parts
I’d take that old truck over new stuff any day off the week! That’s a real truck!
I'm at the VA Hospitall...I died from laughing so hard 😅😅😅
I'll take the old Ford especially since it looks just like the one I gave my son just lifted with big tires
Hilarious...so when it rains you can park it under my truck...
My 77 F250 4x4 has the exact same drivers door squeak
I'm with the old man on this one. If we're talking terrain and muscle I'd rather have the lifted truck over the 350. You can't be beat by terrain when you got the monster tires. I'm sure the true Truck Gang will come after me for that and that's well and fine. I'll just stand in 60 foot wide mudhole
I hope you don't let the dog chase near your vehicles again. I've seen dogs get infront of the wheels and get hit. That was very wreckless. Can't believe you would even put that on YouTube.
Im dont know  you  all but    im rap mi truck  gps atena  whit aluminum foil  juast in case of the rusian hackers   ...
Serious question because I want to know for my beard, how do you get yours so straight ? 🤔
Can I get the 79... With the 350's interior?  ...thanks.
“Hich your life alert if ya need any help”!!!    🤣🤣🤣
I’d take the old one any day of the week, that thing is sick
Good one
I'm take my old truck over em new techno p.o.s Getting so hi tech you can't work on your own truck no mo
I would like to go wheelin’ with that old man.  I’ll have a hole for my Copenhagen
That older Ford really his truck it's awsome
I thought he ran over his dog 😆😂 lol
It’s all fun and games until the guy with the squatted truck pulls up
There is no comparison.  Old school has soul and beauty in design. Little boys understand it without knowing why.
This was hilarious 😂!  Love it!
Is the old truck for sale?
Look at that rust free ford! 😳
I do have to admit I'd work on an older model over a new any day!!! Too many damn censors & electrical crap to break! Just like my ol lady's infotainment system in her Grand Cherokee! Damn thing is only 3 years old and the infotainment screen is delaminating!!!
I’m going to drank coffee at the Hardee’s 😂🤣 I’m in!
1977, with grand prix tires...
Ginger billy you get me through tough time's you are funny and awesome I hope I could meet you sometime and those trucks are awesome
At least you got rid of that damn Nissan
😂😂 that truck was made when America was America
Not sure about who's truck is better but Both of these big uppers could use some LEG WORK. 👍
Dude is hilarious!!
I have been both these guys
Ginger Billy tells it like it is  TROOF
I fell out of my side of YouTube into a silly place….
"I don't have to worry about no Russians hacking into my truck." 😄
For a few years I drove a ’96 for ranger. It had crank turning windows and AC. Also it actually was a little truck. So was it “new” or “old”?
My favorite is the Giblet Jacuzzi and the am-buh-lannce
You are so cool
My uncle had a Ford pickup like that, and in the same color, but with standard sized wheels. He owned it for 40 years, and it was his primary vehicle. I miss the distinct sounds that pickup's components made.
😂😂😂
What a funny old dude...
PS 6
He got that 0 to 60 AC in the old truck
Ginger Billy for president 2024
I love the 79’ F150
I'll take the rust bucket as long as it ain't a ford.
That says eff-tree-fitty
On another point I don't understand why men shave all their hair off their head and then let all that shit grow on their face what's up with that Billy. ??
At least he didn't put rubber band tires on the f350.
All I have to say is that the classic truck is infinitely better than that Pavement Princess. You can actually work on the classic truck whereas if you want to anything other than an oil change without having computers that cost almost as much as the truck.
I think he has this backwards at least from Wisconsin the old men are driving the brand new trucks and the young guys are driving the vintage ones
Bro I can see u building a real mini truck with a squid billy theme lmao 😂
I would take the rust bucket any day!
"Old guy" looks like he has serious jugs.
Man pop culture gets more annoying by the day
LMAO!!! LOVE IT JUST LOVE IT!!! i was crying laughing out loud... TRUCK GANG!!!
"I can spit my Copenhagen through there"  🤣🤣🤣
T
I wish I'd never got rid of my '72 Chevy Cheyenne. Had a 400 small block, long neck 4 speed w/granny gear and 4:13 rear end and could pull a house off it's foundation if it could get traction!
I almost spit my drink out at I’m gonna drink coffee at the Hardee’s lmfao I about died. He must be from GA
A winder
"You can park it under my truck."
SHUT UP! 🤣😅🤣
This is gold
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.  🎈
wow, are they twins? LOL
What kind of gears and axles you have under that old Ford turning those 44’s ?
I'd take that old Ford over the new one any day! TruckGang!
I want that 79 so bad
This guy looks perpetually sunburnt
I’ll take the big block with the carb all day but that 350 is sweet.
Did ye take them off yer snapper lawnmower 🤣
YEEYEE
I'll take the relic.  I can fix it myself if need be.  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I am 100% old school. Those new trucks have too many electronics and plastic parts for me.
“Drinking that gyin and jyuce”
You must be hanging out with Snoop Diggity Dogg drinking on that gin and juice while smoking the wacky Tabacchi. (Truck gang) (Rust bucket gang).
I love my F350 too
See how those heated leather seats work when the water is up to your belt loops!!!!
TRUCK GANG  😆😆😆😆🤘🤘🤘🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣
I’m glad your a Ford fan
3:37 Im almost in there.  Lol.
We can all agree on TRUCK GANG!!!
I just love Ginger Billy...always has me laughing....thank you
ALL TRUCK'S MATTER
One of my neighbors has a huge giant tank looking diesel truck.. probably never seen a gram of dirt in its day.. Bloody pavement princess
🤣
WTF, Russian hackers😂 spitted out my coffee laughing so hard!😂😂😂😂🤘🏼☕
I want the "old" rustbucket Truck  - its cool AF !!
The dog "HEY WAIT!? YOU FORGIT ME" lol this video is gold
Ginger is a offensive slur, i prefer redbeardus americanis
Is this the first time he’s worn a shirt?
Will billy get a Tesla lol
"That there is a 15" lift so if it starts raining and you don't want your truck to get wet, you can park it under my truck." 😂🤣
hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣😂
I have things to do but I had to watch this one twice for a double dose of Mr. Ginger, a true Murican.
Ginger Billy your not right! But I love the work you put into your skits. Keep’m com in’.
F-tree-fitty! 'Murica!  An instant classic, GB. I'm dyin here. 😄
The way he says "fancy" makes me giggle every time.
This guy is definitely American
OMG I LOVE THIS MAN😂 Absolute funniest comedian on YouTube😂😂
"Did that come with Viagra and a walker?" Lol! I love how Billy always manages to be so hilariously relatable,  no matter what our situation may be. I've been caring for older relatives, so this joke really hit 🎯 home. 😁
Ima go drink coffee at the hardeez, wtf 🤣😂
"This truck was made when America, was still MERICA"
i love the older ford, my cousin has the same f100  model. its beautiful!
TRUCK GANG!
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT                   T                   T                   T                   T                   T  😅👍🙂
I am perfectly comfortable with my stock Toyota Tacoma
At 2:53 he said a real man rolls his window down. I personally think that a real man would have opened the litle triangle window first it definitely makes a big difference.
A real man has both those trucks 😀
Honestly I like bolth trucks but I definitely am digging that old Ford especially if it truly has a 429 in it
Love old mans pickup
I GREATLY prefer the Ford. That was sooo much better than that fake Ford.
lmao "you can park it under my truck"
Love it hilarious 😂 hit the life alert 😂🤣😂🤣
Is that 70's ford for sale?
I love that big lifted Ford! 😂
Billy, your told yourself off in this one.  You got his ass.  Lol.  Funny stuff
That flood weather made the taller truck pull it off.
You see that hole, thats my ventilation hole and I can spit my copenhagen through it, Go Billy Go!🤣
The only thing Ford did right is circling the problem
If LMC would just send me a damn catalog I could spruce up my '84 S-10 Sport. What?  There's an online catalog.  That's just stupid.  lol.
***** content that we need****  Can you imagine Ginger Billy and WhistlinDiesel collaborating????
Funny in it's own way.
F350 is good but its no landcruiser... both of those would be completely useless in australias bush, there is such thing as to big... No flex, to wide, to long
A Hilton motel 😂😂😂
I'm going to drank coffee at the Hardees🤣🤣🤣
Should have been a third one.  The 350 towing the 69. And a man bun yuppie gets out with his tighty tight 👖 and says why he loves both with his lotion and beer.
Best video yet
heated leather seats? are you some kind of sissy??
😆 🤣 😂
New truck or old truck we are all apart of TRUCK GANG! God bless
“The future is now old man” -Dewey from Malcolm In The Middle
Lmao are you 4ft tall? Look so short next to them trucks
If i had to choose between them I'm choosing the old truck every single time.
LMAO it's true, I see it all the time hahahaha
Truck gang
I’d take that old Ford anyday

Gingerbilly×Whistlindiesel?
Hahahaha
Guys with soft hands that drive trucks are definitely trying to make up for something.
😁👍
Ginger Billy keep it up
I don't like the new stuff. Built too cheap.
I like the older one's 😁👍
I’d take both trucks in a heartbeat.
Lmao!!
Your crazy as hell I love it.
Ginger Billy gotta do a "big 3" truck swingin' wiener comparison.......maybe even throw aTay-yoda in therr
I spit my coffee thru my nose when ma' geezer said "ill be drinkin coffee at the Hardee's!..nah, i wasn't at the hardee's, YET...
I would roll that old Ford over that dually. Love that old Ford badass.
...HEated  leather seats  lol
“ I tell you what, both both you guys girly trucks suck. My 2006 2500hd Silverado WT trim is a REAL truck. Got non of that fancy girly stuff u’re perdy , afraid to get dirty and never haul a thing truck or so high you can’t haul or tow a thing in truck.  Oh, and my truck like any real true truck sucks diesel and has a hose out floor. No power Windows locks or any of that fancy warm your bum seats.  This is a real truck. “

Thè ole furd did sound cherry …. Sry gotta go with the old school muscle Atm…
Sweet Fords!!Life alert!!😅😅
Man do I miss my 95 F150! The beautiful two tone blue paint with the double gas tank. That thing was a work horse too, I don’t know how many rock and tree stumps and other trucks I pulled out with it! Only problem was the Wisconsin winters and salt ate through the thin wheel walls with rust.
Fuk a fancy pants little new truck.
😂😂
Why would russian hack my truck🤣
Hey Ginger. You need to get ye a LOGO on the side of that ol' FORD saying. "Ya Wanta Fight about it!" All my LIFE!!  LOL
I love this guy!!
I love when he argues with himself.
Funny AF
Those wheels are for the mall parking lot 😅🤣 TRUCK GANG!!
I think they're both awesome for very different reasons
RCS Grading sends their best regards Billy
The Ford was nice but the other Ford was better. No offense but I prefer Ford over Ford.
T.G.👍👍👍👍👍
I saw your show in Ft. Wayne which was very good but you like ford? What's up with that? Lol
I feel like this same argument happens with Jeep owners! lol
Ford or Chevy nothing beats a square body
While I do like some of the comforts of newer trucks. I still prefer the older ones.   I know how to work on them. And I dont have to remortgage the house for parts.
Hit your life alert if ya need any help! lol
I can’t wait till he hit 1M
Let's go rock climbing and see
Sure you have modern luxuries in that F350,but not the smiles per gallon that bad ass dentside gives ya!
If I consider a new model truck it would start with an F2FITTY 😎
Ginger Billy where is Summer Moon Utah Wells?
Now if only they would buy a good truck instead of a ford
Truck gang!
I have spent the last 2 years dealing with a Vietnam Veteran FIL, his health issues and Covid, and his obsession with Hardee's Breakfast!!!😬
LMAO
Trucks went to crap when they started making them to appeal to women. No offence ladies but it's true.
I'll buy that "rust bucket" right now. Serious. " MERICA"
Perfect example of Today's Boys (who think they R Men) and Real Men Built Tough because of the times.. poor soft boys..
Classic V8 any day over a diesel!! How can you not like the tune of a V8 just a barken!!
those stretched TSL SX’s tho😫 i wonder how old ford would do playing with sand at the beach
As someone who drives an old rust bucket with no power anything,  I can relate. I may be missing out on those sweet amenities,  but I'm not missing those monthly car payments any.
Id rather have the dirty old truck anyday…….. except it has ford written on it 🤡
I'd take that rustbomber all day over the fancy 350.
WINDUP windows for life 💯
Lmao 🤣
Fr 69 dislikes clearly they all drive squatted trucks  🤮🤮🤮🤮
This thing says FJB not F350
This vid is a laugh I needed today. Thanks Ginger Billy!
genuine question, why does that ford truck have 6 lug rims? fords use 5X5.5 on 150s and 8X6.5 on 250s and 350s   other than that every aspect of this was spot on
Man casually arguing with himself. Sounds like my family, except he is one of many who records himself for global entertainment. Still pretty funny though.
I love this exact video,  this man is great artist
My new found hero:) big fan from the uk. Never disappoint mate. Thanks👍🏻
Gimmie dat old Ford any day
Facts, drinking coffee at the Hardee’s 🤣🤣
Too many funny things in this one, but "you can park it under mine" and "did yours come with viagra and a walker" were hilarious,   Good shit brother!!! :)
Truck gang!!!!
classic over new model anyday
I don't care who you are,  that there is funny.😁
Thank u MR GINGER BILLY fir summing up life for all us ol folks now a days, being in my mid late 30’s and a hard working ol boy, this made me laugh so hard it made me realize how a truck payment can help us ol people be more comfortable and get with the times.... STILL NOT GONNA GET A TRUCK PAYMENT THO LOL. I’ll take my coffee from Denny’s and have the old Chevy or Ford that I own any day over something I have to work for everyday to pretend I own when I’m 60!
Reminds me of my Dad and Brother lol. Who's truck is better.....Truck Gang
TRUCK GANG!
Id pick that classic truck over that new truck anyday
When being in Truck Gang is more important than how new or old your choice of vehicular off road poison is.......             (TRUCK GANG)
Here comes this old geezer in his rust bucket
Finally a video where you arnt acting gay 😂 good to have ya back
Ford dissing a Ford but I think Grampa Ford will win in longevety.
If you have a new Ford dually, you get to play a fun math game the late model truck owners don't. How many hours do I have to work to make my monthly payment?
I’ll take the ‘79 any day
Jesus Christ loves you
the old truck sounds better when he pulled off
I love the way Billy says "Truck Gang!"
Oh my God funny as hell truck gang
I have a 97 F350; LOVE  my old truck
lol man.     As a person who's daily driver is a 79 F150 4x4,   I approve of all of this.
Mickey Thompson and Super Swampers?  That is pure class.
😂
I bought my wife from the middle east. Her girlfriend from the middle America
Truck gang
Hey Billy, what year is yer rust bucket? I have a 1970, with a four inch lift, a 390 under the hood, and 32” tires. I love it soooooo much! Every time I see the guy who built it and sold it to me, he always asks if he can buy it back, but I always say “no way, I love that truck!”
I'll take whichever you wanna give me! Lol. Both badass!
TRUCK GANG
That was awesome and funny as all get out I love ya buddy
Then a 90s square body 7.3 f350 pulls up and says you both were saying 🛻
#truckgang
Like I say about my old ford. it's payed for not bank owned.
You got any truck gang shirts?
And then you have Ginger Billy. The one who likes both.
Old School rules new school drools through its cracked plastic lol
seriously waitin on the ginger billy movie .. 😍😍
GOOD SHIT!!! HA HA HA HA
I had a 78 bronco it was badass, I wish I never sold it.
Sana All, ASTIG PA MORE! 🔥🍻🇺🇸
“Hit ya life alert if ya need any help”
I'll take that old rust bucket and trash that computer  controlled  Hilton  motel  anytime!
I’d take that old Ford and use it to run over that new F3SHITY than I’d get back in my Chevy so I wouldn’t break down on my way home.
You crazy boy 😂😂😂😂😂
Only the real ones will truly appreciate the “drink coffee at the Hardee’s” line😂
I still prefer the classic rides.
That's a damn F -teenthousand if I ever seen one! You can run over a Prius with one of then. 😙
Don't rip them britches boy lmoa
You should also have wing Windows Brother
I will take the older Ford any day overthe new shit
Even better my old man had a 1978 Ford f250 lifter on 40s and was Ford blue loved that turd LOL
“When America was America”. Damn Ginger Billy, that’s so true. 😢
As soon as I saw a.crew cab dually I was.like thats a real man's truck and when I was 15 that was the first truck I drove and went from Wisconsin Sturgis Bike week with my dad with only 5 miles on a 1993 Ford f-350 with the 7.3 DEISEL  crew cab dually HellYeah Ginger Billy
"Where'd you get them there tires, you take them off your snapper lawnmower?" 🤣🤣🤣
Haha
Prefer an old beater covered in mud over a pavement princess anyday
I had the same old school truck in the late 80s. The only truck I never got stuck. Keeping eyes open for another one.
I am torn. I want them both!
He mentioned russian hacker. That would be a good crossover episode. U know with Taras. The crazy russian hacker on YouTube. Have ginger billy test out a few products. And have Taras talk like ginger billy
Love me some old ford.. heavily regret selling my diesel swapped 71 f250…
My first vehicle is going be a truck because I don't want no wimpy Hilton hotel SUV they got nowadays #TRUCKGANG
Classic trucks are always the move
I love the old Ford sooooooo much better!
Keep the the videos coming bro…Freaking hilarious content👍 😂
Both owners make good points. Can’t decide who’s right.
Me owning 7 classics and no modern truck lol
Dear Ginger_The_Great, can you make short mini movies like once a month or something I'd definitely tune in cause you really genuinely a funny cool dude and the world needs more people like you.
How can I like this sum b****h 1000 times!!?!??!!
The only problem is...they's FORDS Found On Reservation Dump!! 👍👍👍🤣🤣🤣
Both of those are piles of sh$t! 6.7 is the worst ENGINE ever made! Surpassed the 6.0 by a country mile! 429..... lmao you have fun with all the oiling issues!
Truck gang
If it wasn't for the lack of durability and complicated electrical components, I would like new vehicles more.
Funny thing is that the old Ford truck will outlast the new Ford F350.
Had an old Ford F-150 years ago, rust and all...probably my favorite vehicle I ever owned. God Bless 'Merika!
As pizza delivery driver that delivers pizza in an affluent neighborhood, I’d give anything to deliver pizza in that there mud bogger for just one shift. See the looks on those wealthy pricks.
What model was the classic truck though
“When you bought that truck did it come with nail polish and a dress?”  Fucking pissed myself. 😂😂
👍👍👍
Lmao
Price difference? 😂🤦‍♂️
Could be worse. Could be a chevy
I would take the ‘no bells and whistles’ of the 70’s FORD any day! My stepdad had a ‘76 F250 lifted with 42” monster mudders and a 351 Cleveland…that was a going son-of-a-bitch 😉
We all know the old one would eat the pavement princess alive.
TRUCK GANG
Classic truck gang! My first (and only vehicle until 3 years ago when I was 25) was a 1986 K5 Blazer.
How old do I have to be to qualify for coffee at Hardy’s instead of work?
Good to see that old Ford still running love the old classics💪🇺🇸
So..where can I find me one of those beautiful old fashioned beasts with a points ignition 😁👌 Very nice
If I had a truck that dang tall I’d put a rope in it to help me climb, ngl sexy truck but man hoppin in and out would be a nightmare
Russian hackers will hack your truck because you’re ginger billy.
I gotta tiny bitch truck.but it gets me to work.   TRUCK GANG!!!!
Wing window is the AC GB!
I'd take that old first over the new one any day personally.
Powerstroke. Preferred by 5 out of 4 Russian hikers.
“ If it’s raining and you don’t want to get your truck wet, you can park it under my truck.” Hilarious
Truck Gang for life!
Ain't no one gonna talk about how he has a shirt
I'm surprised you can still find a long bed
Classic trucks any day of the week. I'm daily driving a 1987 6.9 IDI F250 with nearly 700k on the original motor. She still performs better than her younger brothers.
I must be old and fat. As I was really liking that old model.
Comic brilliance
Roll down them winders.
You almost killed me. Started choking on my food when you said to park the truck underneath. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i bet this man can make washing dishes entertaining........ your welcome in advance if he does it :))))
The old truck was made back when Murica didn't import everythin
They are great right up until they start leaking, everything. Water , air,  noise . Have a set on my 84 c10 that are driving me loony
Both ford's! But me personally. I'd rather have the dent side truck.  More simple
♥ ☺♥
I'm going with the old school
That's cool and all but did you know God sent His only son Jesus to die on the cross for you because He loves you so much
That f one giddy is on PHUKN FIRE HOTNESS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!  Holley EFI swap that 429....
Classic, Smiles every mile, although Dumb A$$ Tolly bon joe is shafting us every time we fill up. Energy Independence gone, beyond that a new truck cost more than what I paid for my house 20 years ago!!!!!
"Truck gang" 😆 🤣 😂
I called a dude snoop Diggity dog once 😂😂😂 in Seneca SC
This videos just never get old lmao 😂 please keep making more and keep up the good vids lol
Love both trucks
I want that old Ford Billy!!!
If I wanted a powerstroke I'd call your mom
Yep this explains it.
That is a sweet rust bucket
I had a 78 F150 with a hole in about the same spot! It was great for getting rid of things. Good job!
When you said going to Hardee’s to drink coffee I about  lost it only people from the sticks can understand Hardee’s and Dairy Queen there’s no McDonald’s due to the population being 2600 lol
The old truck had what we called 2/60 A/C, Roll down both windows and go 60
Alright billy so I am 15 and for real I will buy that old truck for 2 grand not much but all I have saved up.
When talking about Russian hacking, should've had some Russian opera music start blaring from the Eftwofiddy.
Man..Your Hella funny...!
That newer truck costs as much as four years of college.
4-barrel carbs, Dana 44s, and manual steering racks are what defined men - simple and tough.
Were there trucks?  I only saw the pup.
Ginger Billy should run for president. And what he says before he drives
Billy is the MAN! PERIOD!!!!! All the women want to be with him...All the men want to be him.
How’s your nnn going
So funny
Well if the Russian wasn't to now how things are made on it me and my friends will drive it there and bring a few but no parts will be left when we are throw cause it we will make it like your song says we gonna make it throw all the way to Russian while we're throwing the computers out the window and keep moving and say that's OK parts that were degrees the most while driving you follow behind with your truck and bring some Russian stuff back with us remder new truks new gun to shutdown new truks with computers problems 😉 he'll ya
That 78 or 79 ford is bad ass
Lmao 😂 ☠️ “I’m goin ta drank coffee at tha Hardee’s”
@ 2:00 ... Triggered!!
76 F 100 step side here, caught on fire in Paradise the motor made it. It had the old wood bed and it caught fire and busted out the back window fire went inside the cab and did a lot of damage the dash is metal so it made it easily, needed new brakes, gas tank, leaf springs,brakes and brake lines and shocks, tires and wheels, new back and front windows, new shift sleeve and collar because of the heat and other minor stuff and it still drives and looks like it was in a fire. A new truck would not have made it .OLD TRUCK GANG!!!!!Spirit of 76 lives on.....🇺🇸
L m a o Hilton motel!!!
Haha  haha ha
I literally passed by Russell‘s on the way home an seen the trucks out there and I thought to myself I wonder if ginger is out there😂😂
Now that's a real truck there!! I'm talkin bout the brown one!! #truckgang!!! 🤣😅
Not gonna lie, I’d like to have both of those trucks, for different reasons.
“Drank coffee at the Hardee’s” 😂😆😂
I love them old jacked up trucks! Lets Go Brandon!
I’ve been having a really bad day and this made me smile. Thanks man
Dying laughing at the truck gang 😂
My cousin has a truck like that classic and he uses a 5 gallon bucket to get in. Then pulls it up by a rope after he's in.
Everyone must have the older fellers drinking coffee at Hardee’s. 😂
Lol proof size matters. If your a truck guy that is. 🙂
Hit the life alert if you need help old man lol 😆
I prefer the OLD trucks todays trucks look like shit
"That truck was made when Amurica... was Amurica!" 🤣🤣
as a classic truck lover this was hilarious
Dude is funny though!
Yep. 76 ford,, it didn't matter if your boots were muddy or if you left a screwdriver in your back pocket.
nice truck though, in all honesty
Me as a 16 year old kid who daily drives either a 96 12 valve or 70 International truck at a daddy's money school...  Every morning the disgusted looks I get are worth my leaked oil and antifreeze.
Classic over new any day
Never seen better insults and comebacks...coming from the same person in my life..!!!
Murica!!!
Man I love those old Fords, the things are tanks. Real treasures. I've got a Bronco the same body style that needs some tlc. It's a 351, manual, and runs great but needs a little body work and a lift with some meats.
Old Billy got some tig ol bitties. 🤣🤣🤣 That being said there's something special about the simplicity of an old rig.
Ill take the dentside. No chips no def. But with the 429 it will pass everything but a gas station.
Not gonna lie I kinda want that old truck lol
I take that old beast on 44s but the 350 is nice
!!!TRUCK GANG!!!
I was waiting for him to call that 3fitty a Pavement Princess!
Quick vote:   Double D's   Beer Belly
If u dont like that ole Ford, Hell U jus ain't MERICAN!🇺🇸 Saw a TRUCK GANG sticker on the back of a fellers window this a.m. on the way to work...👉☝️👍👍
Classic truck team right her TaterGang!
I really want to know how tall you are
Past & present Ford douch bags lol Edit: makes me want to listen to a song called all my trucks got mud grips on um.
It has the same AC unit as my rusted out Charger.  Love it.
I like both trucks! The 70s model is my favorite though. The way it sounds 😍😍
The 350 looks good except for those wheels.
I can say now I am officially part of the truck gang! Got my first one today 😊
When it gets to the last 2:26 was the best part 🤣🤣 He definitely got this on point 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
We got a f-350 dually like that one at work and it can't half pull a hill with a little jd 310 backhoe behind it! It bitches and moans constantly!
Not gonna lie, I’d take that old jacked up Ford over that new “wife mobile” garbage any day.  Great video as always!!!
This is like a Meet and Greet at the 4 wheel parts store...
Ginger Billy how many trucks do you have
I actually liked this video.
I tell you what trucks back then were lead sleds and solid as a oak tree. Hell you hit a squirrel in the new aluminum duty trucks it does 10k damage the old ones just buff the bumper out.
I’m a Chevy guy but would rather have the old rig with 44s any day
My 89f250 7.3L IDI Diesel 4x4 will both y'alls truck shame. Truck gang!
Snoop diggitty dog. 😅🤣🤣
Truck gang!!!!
Both are good
I can't wait to see Billy in wichita ks
Well there's your problem,  it says FORD. Get ya a RAM, damn.  🤣
Billy love the  video and both trucks are  great 👍😄
Either way, TRUCK GANG!!
Ur 350 sounds just like my 150 ecoboost!
I'll take the old one any day
Close to 1 Mil
Op
TRUCK GANG
The creek the door makes when he opens it is every vehicle I've ever owned lol
Spit my share of Copenhagen thru the floor of my old 79 Ford. Loved that truck and got better fuel mileage out of it than any of my newer rides.
I don't mind a new truck or old
Ginger Billy is the brown stuff on toilet love all your videos always makes me cracking up
Is this a truck or a Hilton motel. Lmao.
Ginger billy CEO And Founder of TRUCK GANG
Not a Ford fan but i would take the old one over the new without even thinking about it,But i would take my 76 dodge over both any day of the week
Show us on the doll where the big block touched you billy 😂. Give me the classic truck anyway
Fucking gold!🤣
1:35 was he smoking indo with snoop diggity dog too?
That rusty oldy is the best lookin thing ever
Ginger Billy how do you order pizza
The term for the mew truck is "pavement princess "
When are they gonna get Ginger Billy in a Ford Commercial?
Viagra and a wheel chair. That gave me a good belly laugh!
Made fur OFF ROAD PUR POSES  Love ya ma boy
Your a riot.  A buddy just saw your show in canton ohio.. sorry I missed it.. keep on entertaining
I’m going to drink coffee at Hardee’s. I lost it. 😂🤣😂🤣  That being said I’d take the old truck over the new any day.
I prefer the old vs the new
why does your old ford have 6 lug axles? ... you put junk chevy axles under it ? ... should have 5 lug
My wife hates it when a new video comes out……. So I forward it to her anyway!  Keep’em coming and I’ll keep her mad!
I spit Copenhagen through these holes 😂🤣 and air ventilation
That old 79 truck is badass.
Gimme a "rust bucket" ANY GOD DARN DAY!  LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BRANDON

I would rather have the old school Ford any day over the new junk. Fk them Russian hackers!!

God Bless, you are a mess!!! Love it!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Omg! if it rains you can park under mine...

I've seen a similar squavel between an old and young man at a car meet. Dude you're priceless 😂😂
Both schools are fun!  Except I'm in the old school because that's what I can afford.
I’d take that new truck, more reliable and gets the job done
Wait a min..is that ford running chevy axles under it....6 LUG. HMM
The more complicated, the more stuff to go wrong.  Fun video.
I like both
The truck would be Awesome if it was a #CHEVY Can I get a HELL YEAH? 👍🇺🇸
If you were fat, you’d be the perfect stereotypical American I swear😂
U should do these more often. Please do modern v8 vs old v8. Or v8 vs ricer
The old school is definitely better looking but if I had to drive one every day I’m picking the f350.
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Every now n then you have a good one. Lol.
I wonder if someone should tell Billy that people combine these types of trucks. Like put the old stuff around the new stuff haha.
Lol So funny and sexy!
I'd take both love my ford's truck gang
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤠
Give me that old ford any day plz lol
That is a sweet 79 though!!!

I just bought a brown 77 f250 camper special...just like that!  same reason, chip shortage what chip shortage?....  I fixed that, with a can of carb cleaner and a 200$ bag of in-stock parts from rightchown yonder...   then i went and bought me a bag of do-ri-tos, with the money i saved by buying an 'merican truck that didn't run so good.... Fix'd it myself like a real man  who needs Viagra when i can just knock the muffler off that 351 doin donuts in the field...  If that sound don't get you standing at attention,  it's time to hang up your spurs and move to toronto
Rust bucket for life Amurica 🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲
The next video ever

Awesome
I feel this I'm the crazy guy with the older trucks and hot rods

Omg crying here 😝.   I’m 5 foot so either of those would require a ladder for me to get I. Lol
Hand to F-in god this is me and my younger nephew's..🤣🤣..
I had to pause the video at 0:04 so I could stare at the truck.
I'll take both :D
Comments are as good as the content in these situations.
Lol I love it... Wife wants me to get a new pickup...but I love me a classic!!!
Got to admit I lost when you showed your ventilation hole in the floorboard. Another great one.
It's about time you had a real truck on your Channel
The best part of this show is the blue heeler laying under the new truck
That classic came with viagra and a walker because it's gonna be around when his grandson gets old
You should put a link to your MERCH below the video Bc i really want to buy a Truck Gang shirt!
Love the videos keep up the great work can't wait for the next video.

GMC. Gay Mans Chariot
😆👍
I got that “255” air conditioning. Two winders at 55 miles per hour.
Still found on the road dead no matter how old or new....
Do any other wives yell out to their husbands from the bedroom "hey hun, there's a new Ginger Billy out!"?
But i do love my new coyote F150 alot
That truck was made when 'Merica was 'Merica! Yes! very true!🙂
My dad used to have an Old Chevy (I think 87’ or 97’) and this thing was called the tank litterally this thing was lifted like crazy and when ever those new fords or rams that drove by my dad would just laugh. I can kinda relate to this with how lifted them trucks are
Ill take that 78 any day
We need some truck gang shirts to let people know we in truck gang.
I learned how to dive on an old Ford like that 🤭standard and it was fun as hell! I can drive anything and reverse park with any trailer any day because of how my dad taught me. Its glorious driving literal circles around people in their fancy trucks that have never seen a spec of dirt, drywall, rocks, ect. 😎TRUCK GANG!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣heeeee haaaaaw Truck gang for life
In my country neither of these are considered a truck.
I don't there is a video I can relate to more than this one, including almost falling a over t on the side step.
Dude, you are a National Treasure. TRUCK GANG
"I'm almost in there" That's what he said
😂
I like my 95 ford c350 and the 7.3 powerstroke in it
Shit should see my 98 ram you wanna talk about a rust bucket 😂
Trucc  Gang A man to the man
WoW Surprised that the Ford could drive thru the dirt and grass #RAM Power #Cummins
Real  Men have 2-60 air conditioning. 2 Windows rolled down at 60 MPH.
As a classic truck owner I'm going to have to remember some of those insults
Another winner
Lmao, the "old man" looks like me trying to get in and out of my boyfriend's truck.
The A/C on the dentside is the vent window!
TRUCK GANG
dang I like them both #Truckgang
TRUCK GANG
Pretty sure I heard this exact conversation at work today... 😂😂😂
About time you got you a f3fifty
I am classic trucks all the way
That '79 loos like mine, but mines 2wd with a 302. I'd rather have the old truck than the new one. Awesome video!!!!!
New truck: check engine light com on, minimum of $2500 1998 12v Cummins: lol, what's a CEL?
Classic as always lmfao
Gingerbilly what's your thoughts on modern Jeeps? I have the same FUEL brand rims and tires on my 2017 Wrangler.
Truck gang ☝️👈
Damn..... this was just like the argument me and my nephew had last week about the exact same thing!!
Might not have a computer exactly but that 429 Does have a voltage regulator, between that and the C4/C6 auto trans it prolly has one good solar flare would stop that truck dead in its tracks…. I love my old Fords, but….. just saying
Well it's about time you did another video I was getting tired of watchin speed buggy.
I am so VERY VERY much an old school truck girl. 👍👍
Never have I agreed with both parties more than this.
Great Actors !
That old Ford is legit man
Damn I'm homesick for my beautiful GA.... And I'm up here in ME. 😫
I love your hill billy azz
Atta boy ginger Billy I love them trucks ya got
Haha. I have BOTH of those. Hilarious!
i enjoyed every second of this video, keep up the good work 😂
I mean if you want to fix or repair daily. Gimmie a Mighty Max any day. Truck Gang!
My favorite truck is the cateye chevy, I got a 2005 cateye chevy with mud tires and its in great condition. I rather have an older truck than a new one
Everyone says they'd take the ole rust bucket. I'd take both!! Cant complain at either one!
That s*** was epic no matter how you look at it was a win-win situation Ford against Ford can't go wrong there 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I know My man would be all about the old Ford pickup!
Let's all agree, Ginger Billy is too underrated
Rather have the old school ride personally
I'd rather have the anti hackable truck
Nice fords, let me know when y’all need a tow.
3:41 🤣🤣
Truck out?🤔🙃👋🏼 Bwahahaha 🤣😅
The old geezer truck is a real truck...not like that new piece of shit...
🤣🤣🤣
Check the ashtray for a Russian sub ya never know
Sounds like an advertisement lol.
I sure would like to drink some beer with you maybe even fire up the old bowl
I’m honestly the old truck guy. I do like the fancy new stuff but it really is unnecessary. The fancy stuff will fail, and you’ll need another truck. Why do you think the old truck is still on the road, and why my family still has the f-150 we bought twenty years ago
God Bless Hardee's!!!"
And if either of them break down, just call someone with a Chevy or a Dodge to get you. . .  Don't be mad, I had to make the joke lol. Seriously though, love both of those trucks ! But I'm partial to my K5 :)
Lmao good sh** couldn't stop laughing on this one
Monstermax 2 would eat both those trucks.
TrUcK gAnG
I watch these videos and realize i need to move down south real fast. At least the people there are normal.
Id take the old truck on this one, i dont like duallies plus that mf is lifted to the sky with some nice mudders too
Did if g-billy made a video of himself just sayin “truck gang” with the T hand gesture I could watch that all day. That shit makes me lose it every time I hear it. Think ima gonna make it my ring tone. Haha. Keep up the funny business big dog. You rock!!
That’s a gorgeous rust bucket you gotchurself there brother. I’m the proud owner of a 93 f150 xl. Factory no ac but I got them sweet little wing vents! Wouldn’t trade it for anything. Love yer content by the way! Keep it comin brother. Yer one of the greatest comedians I have ever had the pleasure of laughing at.
Both are gorgeous trucks,...I mean other than somebody obviously puttin them ford emblems on em when you weren't lookin. Probly them unsupervised neighbor kids.
2-60 a.c. all you need is 2 wing windows at 60 and life is good
Merica 🤙
"Hit your life alert if you need any help" lmfaooo
I'm gonna have to agree with the classic trucks, they're easier to work on and are a lot more simple than the newer trucks with the electronics. Never had a  hand crank window fail on me unlike the powered windows. 😂
How about a 1972 Toyota Land Cruiser VS Made in america truck.....Domestic VS Foreign
We don't need airbags...we die like real men....damn right.
Ginger Billy is so funny. Love his videos, they never disappoint
This is now my new favorite!
I always bug my stepson about his street wheels on his f350 . Go git some Mickey Thompsons
Hilarious!!!!   🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I live in NORTH CARLINA..SUP GINGER MAN;)
This is pure gold
I'll take the dentside Ford all day long every day. Ford hasn't made a better looking truck since 1979.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We need to make America, America again Let's go brandon
Those "Rust Buckets" will be around long after all new cars are sent to the junk yard.
Thats hilarious.... I daily a 79 ford
lol 😂 you are so awesome
1:14 that’s a good point
Up next, my exhaust tip is bigger than yours. O' ya, well I gots me a 55 gallon exhaust tip. Beat that.
I love this guy, Merica!
In the real world we call them's compensation trucks & wheels.
Is it me or were them seats leaned way back lol
The way he goes 😲 at the end of a sentence 😂😂😂😂
My two favorite fords!
I literally got done working out in my pasture with a “classic” truck LOL
My first car was a  1977 Ford F-150 custom  Short bed 4x4 with 400 engine on it  I still miss it and remember all the memories wow that was fun
Would you buy the Ford F150 lightening
I’m honestly sick and tired of mine and these modern rolling Hilton trucks. I’d much rather have that 79!
His legs are so small
You can park it under my truck 😂😂
TRUCK GANG 👉 ☝️
Tree Fiddy!!
is that old ford for sale?
Them teers is made to cruise the mall parking lot 🥲
he's right you don't need no stupid computer shit... the Russians might hack into that fancy F3 Fitty
They're both Fords, so you lose either way! 😆
I'll take the new model 350. Better in every way besides nostalgia.
Still rather have the old one, haha!
I wonder where I fit in. I have a ‘95 K1500 and a ‘14 Silverado crew cab🤣
Beautiful square body
EeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
It reminds me of how I feel every time I fire up my daily driver, my 84 Bronco.  My winders are my ac too. I have a 2 - 55 ac system. Lol
"You can park it underneath this truck!!"
Lmfaoo great video keep up the great content 👍
you missed the most important thing about late model trucks, those little triangle windows were AMAZING.
I have a 2013 truck and never use the AC (4 window and 55mph) that's the AC for me
My first truck (not my first vehicle) was a 2009 F150. Loved it with a passion but I unfortunately still had "new driver blues" and wasn't very careful with it. It was very basic. Not a lot bells and whistles and that's the way I liked it. This is coming from a millennial btw. I could still charge my phone but not much else. Had to get rid of it due to it being so worn out. Got a newish 2020 Dodge Ram with all the new bells and whistles on it. I like it well enough. It's certainly fun to drive but it lost something with me being that it's so techy. I'd give anything to have my old truck back, but in "new" shape again.
So true!!!🤣
That is the most beautiful truck.  The old ford that is.
I'd still take the the old Ford over the new.
I was just thinking about you Ginger Billy and was hoping for a new video and you read my mind! 😂😂😂😂
Idk my F150 is pretty damn comfortable...but I'd take em both Truck Gang 💪🇺🇸
That was some of the funniest thing I've ever heard he said Russians are going to hack into my truck for what that's funny
He should have opened the little side window when he said U want to see my AC
I highly doubt it. But you ever wanna sell that 79 short bed Ford you let me know. My favorite truck. Has to be the short bed in that year. When there lifted like that you can’t beat it. Awesome truck! 👍
That Ford is not a rusty bucket that thing is a freaking beauty. Nice truck.
The sad part is, I know these two guys. They live here in Oklahoma.
old trucks are better trucks just like people
I got a 96 f150. I felt that
That was hilarious - I still don't know who's side I'm on, I'll be down at Hardee's thinking about it over a cup of coffee 🤔
That is hilarious 🤣
Who dislikes this stuff?
Billy, I like to say that my first car is an 81 El Camino and now my second vehicle is a F!!CKING FORD!
0:34 the doctor when my mom was giving birth to me
Yelp I’ll take my 92 Chevy over any new truck no payments and it screams America 35 year old from a holler deep in Kentucky
screw new trucks. needs a power stroke to haul all the sensors that it needs to run. never thought you'd need a fluid to add to your exhaust to be compliant. real trucks are made of steel🤣. but the new trucks are worth more as scrap due to the aluminum and catalytic converters 🤣🤣
This was awesome!
LOL love it bro, keep bringing the funny 🤘🤘👍🇺🇸😁
I’m on old man’s side
Hell yeah I love both of those badass trucks especially the brown one 🤘
That old ford got that  2@55 ac
i'm so old i remember mickey thompson
ginger billy vs larry the cable guy. battle of the best.
That little truck is what I wont
I've got a 1968 f100 4wd that I've had for 22 years I've never touched the body dented and rusty but I did rebuild a 427fe side oiler and drop it in with 600 horse and 8000 rpms outa a big block with a 3speed manual truck weighs 3800lbs it moves and don't break I'll take it over a new truck any day
Billy, I always look forward to your videos, when you are ready to replace that Earnhardt hat, let me know.
This is classic ‼️🤣🤣🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Either way... Amurica wins‼️👍🏽👍🏽
😂😂😂
You gotta do more truck gang stuff it's hilarious
72 f250  4wd highboy.  557 stroker.  6 speed manual
I'm going to drink some coffee at the hardest 😂.
Man I love them old trucks.  Wish they were still being made today
As a born and raised into a Chevy girl until about 6 years ago when daddy turned Toyota and returned us too this makes every Ford joke seem true from my past.  Now that I am grown I see "almost" every truck as a truck except for a Nissan and the new jeep trucks. To me the jeep trucks look like lifted like Chevy El Camino, or a lowered Chevy Avalanche without the side rails. Anyone else agree?
I need that lifted Ford
I would rather have the old one.
Bad ass short bed right there 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
No matter what they are both in truck gang
I'll take my 4bt Cummins swapped 1964 Dodge W300 Powerwagon 20+mpg over any of this modern overthunk computerized emissions junk! Great job as always Ginger Billy I just died when you said park it under the lifted Ford when it rains🤣
I love old school trucks
lol this is awewome!
I’d take that old Ford over a new one any day
TRUCK GANG TRUCK GANG WE DON'T DRIVE NO CARS MAN
How true!! LET'S GO BRANDON!!!!!
First time seeing a "Truck Gang" and "Truck Chicks Rock" bumper stickers at a Lowes this week. 😆
I can't wait to see Ginger Billy's Channel hit 1 million
Why Ford omg Mr.Ginger Billy Chevy makes a new good truck
"That truck was made when Amurica was Amurica." Amen to that
Lol, that boy needs Jesus
Old truck is bad. Wanna see gingers car collection. F Jeff Leno’s garage
He's hilarious 😆😆😂
TRUCK GANG!!!111.
New truck guy: " this has got that 6.7 powerstroke"   Me: now listen here kid we don't need to know how many times a day you power stroke your weenie. And by the way, you shouldn't be doing that 6-7 times a day. Play with it too much and it'll fall off.
TRUCK GANG
F tree-fitty
I just bought those same wheels for my 86 k10
Aint about why would they hack your truck, you're Ginger Billy,, video entrepreneur and astronaut, it's about why WOULDN'T they hack your truck! Have. Nice day!
I liked the gin and juice reference, i like that song
Did I see a Hillary 2016 sticker on that old truck!?!
I'd bet next thing billy will do is jack that fiesta up about 15 16 inches and put them tires on it lol
The old one will still be running in 20 years!   ;)
"I'm going to drink coffee at the hardees" 🤣
Man 8 people need to take a chill pill and get a sense of humor 😂😂
ok new model wins i shouldnt have to get an nba player to lift me into that thing there ok, i should not have to go rock climbing just to get in my car XD
I like how old geezer has big hooters.
truck gang!!
I'll take that old truck any day.
Both trucks are nice
I’d take the old one any day of the week, that thing is sick
Hell yeah brother. Truck gang
I've had and regret selling, a Mighty 76 and a Mighty 79. I was the guy the jeep girls would call to get them out of the mud. I have hooked up and pulled a 70 foot single wide out of the brush, then turned it into a 2 Derby car hauler. It got between 4 to 7 miles to the gallon with or without 20,000 lbs behind it. Trucks were trucks back then, even Chevys were beastly, sorry dodge.
Can’t beat the look of those short wides.
The virgin “late model” Fan Vs The Chad “New model” Enjoyer
Powerstroke THIS. 🥒
I'll take that old Ford any day
Awww man it's a beautiful day outgcheeer 😝
15 inch Mickey Thompson looking nice
The only thing funnier is that it's a 6.7 and has Fuel wheels.
I tell you what I love that damn Rust Bucket,  exactly the way it is.  Just Beautiful 💯🇺🇲🇺🇲💯!!!!!  (TRUCK GANG)!!!
O9 + f 150s suck I had to use a 2019 loaner hated the way it drove no power in the low or exccel
"T" - addict! 😂
Can I have your truck
The most important part is both respect because Truck Gang!
Ngl this is funny,but i have mad respect for vintage cars
Truck gang old or new
Vintage trucks all the way. They're better for four-wheelin'
Lol....
Doggie!
Definitely prefer the old Ford for sure which has a very unique sound.
AWESOME VIDEO GINGER BILLY🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸 KEEP THEM COMING OLD MAN......SEE YA AT HARDEES 😊🍔🍟😊🍔🍟😊 DAILY AT 5:30 AM!!
The real ac is those triangle windows
EMP. anyone? Your new fangled truck won't run
I like both 🙃
Now that's great shhhtuffff!
For those who don't know, that Hardee's line still rings true today as it did 26 years ago and I'm 31.
I rather drive my 73 bronco over my 18 3500 ram , but I'm afraid they'll steal my bronco
"Boy, is this thing a truck or is it a HIL-ton MOTE-el?!"
late model is new model. I think he means early model.
Truck gannnngggggg
Love that ford! Keep putting in ginger billie vids and stuff. Saweet
Yay a new video I love it 🥰 good laugh for the night!!
👍😎
I would proudly roll in that "rust bucket". But you can keep the gin and juice.
TRUCK GANG
Love the old truck I’m looking for one my self
youre both gaf for driving fords.....my 83 k5 gets all the trailer trash...i feel like an ice cream truck when i cruise through
Uh, "late model" is the same thing as "new model"  😏🙄 "early model" is the same thing as "older model"...sooooo, there you go.
All I can say is be prepared for an 80% tax increase if Biden gets his $4 trillion plan
Hell I'm on the old man side that old Ford looking good that's a real man's truck not some little fancy-schmancy I'm afraid to scratch it TRUCK GANG
TRUCK GANG
Dislikes are honda ridgeline owners
Made when America was America 🤘
Of course he has to go to work, gotta make that money for truck payments, LoL
Awesomely funny video billy hope you have a awesome day
The F350 is nice but I'll take old-school any day😎🤘🇺🇲
Ginger Billy never dissapoints
This is hilarious, I do love those old dentside fords
Once again, Mr. Billy, you make me laugh......No easy task. Thank you for being so consistent. What a pleasure it is to have people like you available to entertain us. A much better choice than respiratory therapy! Cheers!
It's funny how the old trucks still last till this day while new trucks break down so much it's not even funny. 😂😂😂😂
I'm the one in between youns tryin to break up the fight. I'm best of both worlds. Old Square with a 5.3. Rust Free Texas Squarebody made its way to the Hills of Kentucky. 😎🇺🇸
Kind of lost the argument when they both have a Ford......
So true old models are better
Perfect!
🤣Truck gang! 💜y'all
I prefer old trucks
I agree with you
#TRUUUKKGAAIN
Just sayin, I'm a young guy with a late model so where does that put me? Lol
Oh yeah…. This is absolutely the best video I have ever seen.
Loved you and Brandon in Cincy the other day.
"Shut up, ion need no life alert" --Ginger Billy
I’d take that old Ford over that new crap any day 🤘
Badass truck billy love old model trucks😩🥵😂😂
You never cease to amaze me with these videos 😂😂
Wouldn't be Early Model trucks guys VS late model truck guys?
