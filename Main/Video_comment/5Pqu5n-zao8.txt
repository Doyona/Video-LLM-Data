Second worst subclass rework after void imo. Completely destroyed any semblance of balance between guns and abilities, but also wrecked each solar tree's identity and gamplay loop at the same time
REMINDER THAT BUNGIE FUCKING SHOT DAWNBLADE IN THE HEAD AND DAWNBLADE 3.0 IS THE WORST SUBCLASS IN THE GAME
Solar’s my main subclass but when we get a red one that will be my main subclass
coming back to this i have hope on arc 3.0 hunter 🫣
Destiny 2 dead bungo killed it lol, p.s Bungie I'ma follow you through all future games just to make sure you nerf everything and patch tricks making the game boring and unplayable. Gotta love that Hawthorne stare skip patch like how TF did you waist your time worrying what I'm doing I'm just gonna break every game I touch and you will nerf or patch everything to oblivion until everyone plays the way YOU intended them to play. Jump Theory was right about you. I'll see you soon!
W video
We're the best healers, Bungie?  Really? You sure?
Warlocks needs to roll back to solar 2.0, you ripped apart what made them unique and good
Anyone know if you can still get Insight to finish upgrading the war table? Ever since new season dropped the table stayed and looks like I can upgrade still but I can't figure out where to get insight anymore. Doesn't give u the usual "How to" description anywhere about it or in all weekly missions there's no Insight as rewards in any of them aswell. Very confused. Driving me bananas seeing it unfinished every day
It might just be me, but seeing all the debug menus and test maps REALLY makes me want to tinker around with the dev tools. I’ve always craved a “Forge” mode in this game, I know it’ll never happen, but a Guardian can dream…
I own every dlc and even tho this came out im still glad I walked away from destiny 2 on day 1 of witchqueen
You did good,then you changed IB to rift and took a few major steps back...🚽
fu you ahles. you will not get one more dime from me
I really miss our resident "Acting Out Supers" guy. You'll be sorely missed.
Saya kurang mengerti bahasa inggris
The only thing solar 3.0 melted was my joy for this game with the never ending nerfs on solar titan
Armor look fire 🔥 😍
Some time has passed and for the record, I’ve been enjoying Solar 3.0, but I found that none of the subclasses are really filling the niches you set out for in this vid.
Excellent game
Warlocks got a fancy snap and bungie fxxk whole dawnblade up. Well done! Youguys TOTALLY know how to destroy this game.
Thats nice but solar 3.0 warlocks feels a little underwhelming
Rico: KABOOM ? Skipper: Yes Rico KABOOM. >.<
SJW WOKE FEMINIST TRASH
Warlocks: "well that was a fuckin lie"
Can you not neft the warlocks because they have a high win rate in pvp please.
Meh
There exists a Class Action Lawsuit against Bungie and their deceptive marketing. It's always been a data mining operation. Like Facebook, Bungie has been compiling data. Not disseminating entertainment.
More then 3 team members in regular play
Full metal alchemist 😂😂😂 fucking mustang
But my question is, is this going to stay permanently or just a seasonal thing?
I’m actually really excited to see the changes they bring in arc 3.0. I’d love for them to turn mid tree arc staff deflect into an ability and replace the super with an updated bladedancer.
"Balance should never come at the expense of fun." *Looks at Shadowkeep* *Looks at every single time they nerfed the PVE side of a piece of gear* *Looks at every dumbass "Champion" level enemy that pigeonholes you into using weapon archetypes that you hate just so you can get past their BS and kill them* *Looks at the time they nerfed SEASONAL FUCKING PVE MODS* Yeah, sure. "Never..."
I'm kinda happy they rolled out Solar 3.0 after Void. I expected them to release Arc before Solar just because of how I personally see more Arc users than Solar users. Also Gunpowder Gambit is the most fun I've had with my Solar build.
Hunters are basically Easy Pete.
seriously Bungie!?! are you trying to make attract more cheater to come?!?. You guys makeing more worse for more cheaters to come
what a disappointment
feels good so far, but warlocks got the short stick here, feels mostly like a nerf overall and several support role basics were removed/modified, sun warmth and stuff should have more actual healing chances but it's  just not there Void still super awesome though
Spoiler Solar 3.0 feels like a nerf for all solar subclasses maybe hunters get the pass but it has way less synergy and momentum than it did before...
Warlocks got new melee animations with the Thanos finger snap, hunters got a backflip and a buff to their hitscan super and titans got nothing new and nerfs on top of it. Thanks devs!
Looking at it a couple days in...solar is way underpowered compared to the other changes of void and stasis.
every warlock become Roy Mustang.
and that took 4 monts to create hahahahahaha
I love all of this update except for two of three warlock aspects being about air combat. I don’t find air combat fun which means I kind of just waste an aspect slot which doesn’t really feel great on a class I love so much.
So yeah, solar 3.0 is great and all... but does anyone else feel like void 3.0 kinda blows this outta the water? I feel like theres more variety in solar 3.0 then void, but the formula for void worked so well in pve. For reference I'm a titan main, so I'm talking from the perspective of a titan.
Ends up a disappointment for most players, especially Titan and Warlocks. Solar is not on same level of effectiveness as void. Hoho check reddit, lots of complain and feedback.
I really love that all Solar Sublclasses have supportive abilities. Using a healing grenade and Acrobat's Dodge on Hunter is something I never thought I needed until now.
what'a nerf :)
Humboldt stole my sweatshirt!
theyve nerfed solar into the ground the fire god fantasy falls flat your not even close no balance at all shouldve just left it alone
ngl solar 3.0 very mid unless youre a hunter
Thanks for destroying 2 branches of the Warlock subclass   Seriously, void 3.0 was an upgrade, solar was just a fancy way to nerd stuff
Fix warlock pls you massacred dawnblade beyond belief
This season sucks
Solar literally became the flashiest subclass- that warlock snap brought a newfound joy into my heart. - A local Titan Main
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand its shit!
Compared to void 3.0 its massively underwhelming.
All they did is take apart the supers and make them aspects.
rip warlock
ahh i see, Hunters got no love again...
It is all broken !!!!!!! Fix your game !!!!!!!!!!! Please for god sake !!!!!!!! We payed good money for it !!!!!!!! Do you part now !!!!!!!!!
worst season ever already the gameplay loop is literally kill do aticvity do bounties and farm patrols and hope something drops a key for loot that isn't red lined
RIP warlock
Incendiary nades feel so bad in pvp to me honestly. 30th anniversary made them my favorite nades in the game, and now the scorch not killing makes them feel really bad. Overall good changes but... needs tuning to really feel right. edit: Regardless, big thanks for bringing back the Calus Mini-Tool better than ever! Missed that thing.
I’m pretty disappointed with the update not gonna lie.. I’ll still play the game but this was over hyped.
I want them to add a quest were you go to the dark side and try to take down the las5 city
I FUCKING LOVE WARLOCK HAVING PHOENIX DIVE AND ICARUS DASH
Make sure you can't be killed while in midair mid super like every other class for titan.
Warlock now like Roy Mustang from fun metal alchemist
did anyone else think the warlock snap was inspired by bioshock's fire vigor
RIP Warlocks we got cucked this update
The snazzy animations are what makes these great. If they were just bland waves or slides then it wouldn't make you feel as good using them. These animations convey a level of confidence only an immortal space wizard would have
unblivable
My thing about this whole update is the resilience buff. All of this is cool. But I play tanks in every game i can. So being able to actually fill that role makes me happy. But what im scared of is bungie is gonna do what bungie does: and will nerf it because other classes dont want too deal with it.
1:15 “but also they’re the best healers.” So that was a lie.
Nice job ruining warlocks
Solar 3.0 is an abject failure. What are you doing to fix this? Respond promptly.
Literally the same thing still. Maybe I check it out when it's version 10.0 and has 4 skills, and when dodge is not a charge skill lol
So did the Warlock dev only play top tree dawn? Because this feels like TTD 3.0. Sure, incinerator snap animation is cool but there were so many synergies that were broken with this update. Why are 2/3 aspects taken from TTD and focus on floating in the air? While floating in the air works out great in PVP, it does NOT work well for end game PVE content where being in the air is a death sentence.  If you were a Lord of the Sweats TTD player, this update is for you. If you liked healing on middle tree or ad clear monster on bottom tree? RIP  I know that it's only been a day and I'm hoping that when more time gated aspects/fragments are released that the subclass will feel more complete (especially another PVE focused fragment) but as of now, it feels like whomever worked on these changes only played and focused on PVP.
The whole snap yo fingers thing kinda turns ur guardian into Roy Mustang from Full Metal Alchemist
Is there a reason why my Power level went from 1568 to 1540?
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Vault of glass 40 times no vex Lot of fun
Hello, Love to you all. Repent and believe the gospel, that our Lord and savior Jesus Christ was God, who came to us as a human being over 2000 years ago, that he lived the perfect life we can’t, died on the cross and shed his blood for all of our sins, and was resurrected 3 days later, by the power of God. Simply believe this, and be forgiven and saved from Gods judgement.  By grace through faith in our Lord, you are saved, and there is nothing you can do to earn his favor. God wants to give you the free gift of eternal life to all those who'd believe in his sons sacrifice for salvation! He will then give you his Holy Spirit to help walk and guide you in all his ways, get baptized as well afterwards. Please read the new testament to get more info about Jesus Christ.  The Lord Jesus Christ bless you all
Vácuo 3.0 still more powerful changes of subclasses.
This is easily the worst 3.0 incredibly dissatisfied. I knew it was unlikely for you guys to return revive to us but to find that the update was this lacking. Even if I wasnt hoping for revive this is so lacking wtf bungie no wonder you avoided hyping this.
03:00 when he snapped my screen got darker cuz my battery is low

TITAN SOLAR 3.0 is the dissaster ! no more heal on sunspot kill nerft ability regen now to heal I have to run into another sunspot ?
I can already see Cruicuble now 😬
Can you explain as to why all my Legendary weapons have been nerfed on the base stats?
70 different erections rn because of this, and i'm an arc main!
Dude Solar 2.0 was better than 3.0 on both Warlock and Titan lol they fucked them
They really called warlock the healers when they don’t have an aspect dedicated to healing but 2 too flying lol
Oh, now i see who is testing stuff at bungie, noted.
should have brought sunsinger back if you want real balance and face melting fun!
Im glad i get to see the thought process of the people ruining this game.
"balance can never com at the expense of fun" Ya... balance is terribly bad. Le Monarque one shot kill just move from Titan to Hunter, and need no exotic. Well of Radiance can't oversheild makes it completely useless in high end content and PVP. I have no fun playing this game now. Thanks Bungie, for this season of disappointed...
Everyone knows Hunters for being such big support players. Oh man from like the old raid days, you remember when people so badly needed Hunters to buff teammates?   Man. Never ONCE has that been a thing.  As it stands, Titans are literally masters in all categories for Solar. Warlocks got nerfed and now it's just Well and float. Hunters I think have an identity crisis that won't be used for the intended purpose, personally, but I will note there is a big where the 6 shots Goldy DOESN'T refund shots even when Radiant.  But ALL classes got MASSIVE ability regeneration nerfs. USE WELL MODS MY FRIENDS!!!!
yet you havnt fixed the new light misssions fucking cunts
Look out world, I’m about to Thanos the heck out of y’all
Destiny 2 is running like crap with the release of solar 3.0 that patch update causing crashes and all sorts
I love everything that you guys have done lately, I even found fun in Stasis, but Solar Warlock is ruined in my eyes. Bottom tree got practically deleted which was one of my favorite trees in the game and Dawn Chorus gor reworked. Also Heat Rises and Touch of Flame have zero synergy because they both require your grenade for it's own effect.
Ducktaping heavy explosives together is 100% a hunter thing to do These changes are going to be amazing!
I am never going to take this Titan helmet off, and this looks amazing! Can't wait to play with it in a few hours
The armor is my favorite this is what we wantttt
My friend would have loved this. Thank you for giving him such a fun game to play and allowing us to have something to remember him by.
Hallowfire Heart gonna be fun this season, especially with aspects and fragments reducing cooldowns. Titans gonna have a field day with both Ad clear and boss DPS.

Really Making  warlocks and the other classes feel like warlocks and what not can't wait to play.
Hunters play hunters for one simple reason. You get a giggle out of the stupid stuff. Like duct taped explosives.
Hallowfire Heart gonna be fun this season, especially with aspects and fragments reducing cooldowns. Titans gonna have a field day with both Ad clear and boss DPS.
God damit this game a has a knack of bringing me back when I'm sure I'm done with it.
Feel like this is this beginning of a new era for Destiny! So pumped!
So far Light 3.0 is all better than Stasis
Hallowfire Heart gonna be fun this season, especially with aspects and fragments reducing cooldowns. Titans gonna have a field day with both Ad clear and boss DPS.
now it Time TO Back to The Game
Season of the recycled content KEKW
At 0:35 it shows hunters have 4 melees, 3 supers, and 3 dodges. The selected dodge looks new, like a healing or support dodge, so hyped!
I like that the vortex type grenades all have their own identity with the change to solar grenades - Vortexes pull enemies in, Duskfields slow more than they damage, and now Solars also spew smaller fires. With that change Sunbracers will be really fun to use now that I think about it lol
Aight, the Snap is what’s gonna get me back into the game
It's Shit.  You destroyed the warlock, you had a good thing going  never playing solar again
Is Unity used in this game?
Can confirm Roy Mustang is in fact a warlock now 🔥🔥🔥
3:02 I can finally fulfill my dream of becoming The Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang
Really love these type of videos
Yea I’d love it if your update didn’t break the f@&king game
At 0:35 it shows hunters have 4 melees, 3 supers, and 3 dodges. The selected dodge looks new, like a healing or support dodge, so hyped!
I love the fact that they’re really driving us into this, pick your element power fantasy where people who really really embrace a play style and theme can feel good about logging on, solar and stasis is always my favorite elements so this season is gonna be amazing
So.. why dont you bring back all the contents that i payed and you completely removed from the game and put this new stuff in a 3rd chapter of the game? Thank you
warlock finger snap is dripping with swagger

Warlocks are Roy Mustang now lol
So during the last weekend of Guardian Games the quest said I was top 10% on Saturday evening. I didn't check Sunday or Monday because I graduated highschool. I'm not getting the triumph and I can't find a way to track what top % I was. Is anyone else having this issue? 😰
This would have been really cool last Thursday. Seems moot to release it after lots of people have either jumped in the game already, or are currently at work and chomping at the bit to go home and play already
Ducktaping heavy explosives together is 100% a hunter thing to do These changes are going to be amazing!
As a top tree and middle tree warlock solar main I'm so excited for this, I'm going to be able to Icarus dash AND heal. Also I am totally making a melee build for that finger snap
Cayde sense of humor lives in this ductape tripmines, thank you all for solar 3.0 its really FUN again
Ducktaping heavy explosives together is 100% a hunter thing to do These changes are going to be amazing!

I love how the new Warlock Melee gives us some crowd control while also letting us keep our grenade for the charged healing!
Really love these type of videos
Shame the solar fragments leave a lot to be desired compared to the void/stasis fragments
Yo yo yo. How do I Phoenix dive now?
My thoughts so far:  this is a pretty spectacular letdown. You could say middle tree gunslinger got its maximum potential buffed a little bit in exchange for much less forgiveness, and Sunbracers Warlock is stronger (when people don't snatch your melee kills from you) but other than that, it seems and feels like nerfs across the board. Phoenix dive is now competing with rifts? Ability Regen from healing is a fragment that barely does anything, and the same goes for hunters with class ability Regen on burn (I think that fragment is actually bugged and not working)? Titan sunspots now barely do anything in exchange for slightly greater ease of use and roaring Flames is altogether nerfed? Practice Makes Perfect is gone? On paper maybe this made some sense, but the only synergies that exist here are ones that existed before and now don't leave room for other things to be at the same level as before, a lot of those old synergies are gone entirely and nothing has come to take their place (so we effectively only have two, two and a half perks of the trees from before), numbers are down across the board ESPECIALLY for titans that supposedly are the "big damage" solar subclass, and stacked up against Void 3.0 in practice, it feels like all three solar subclasses were nerfed. Warlock wasn't hurt nearly as much (they literally kept their important abilities fully intact), but the cuts to the healing/support playstyle hurts a lot. This doesn't feel like it was rushed, this feels like there wasn't any effort put in by anybody but the animators and artists.
Bungie needs to fix Solar 3.0. made warlocks almost useless now  what the heck was they thinking.
Roy mustang as a warlock
If we are going in this direction I have high hopes for arc
Can't wait to Roy mustang something as a warlock
I cant express how much of a let down all of this is. The trailer tried to hype it up so much. All 3 classes got gutted. New animations are cool to look at but every other aspect is an embarrassment. I was hoping the dev team would finally learn from their string of failures but they are only getting worse. Sony got screwed in their acquisition deal. These clowns are going to burn the whole franchise down if left unchecked.
HOT HOT HOT LOVE IT
So if it's less fun, they won't balance it.  Can we please at least make celestial nighthawk viable again in pve?
Still didn't get twilight garrison back, but you can only ask for so much I guess
Titan: I go up and you go down Hunter: Watch this trickshot Warlock: Snap of the fingers and boom God, this is going to be fun.
Y’all been slacking on hunters after the void sword….. why do we get a jerry rigged cluster of solar grenades? When titan is dual wielding hammers and warlocks get a fiery projectile at the snap of thier fingers? It seems a little, off
This seems underwhelming on my initial playthrough. Lots of bugs(more than a normal launch) and Phoenix dive is now tied to your class ability at full charge time. Totally bonkers balancing. I'm guessing solar is getting more buffs than nerfs in the future
Guess the fun went at the expense of balance, cause y’all neutered solar warlock.
Is D2 worth picking up again? I stopped because the community was so toxic when it came to getting a team together for raids. Not to mention I don't like the idea of having to keep paying for DLC that should've been part of the initial game to begin with. And it became boring with how repetitive missions/strikes/raids were. Same thing with thr weapons too..
that warlock snap is giving me roy mustang vibes
Time to become Roy mustang
Yes !!!
Sunbreaker 0.5 is crazy
So uh, after playing with Solar 3.0 I can confidently say, this trailer hypes it up way more than what it actually is. Solar 3.0 is not even in the same league as Void 3.0, which I already thought was meh to begin with. I'm hitting enemies with my abilities and the burn just tickles them.
That's all warlocks get? Snap of a finger? What are we Thanos now?
As a sunbracers main, I am EXCITED
Empireor Calus...I don't feel so good
Glad to see that Roy Mustang made his way into Destiny
Nobody: Warlocks with Solar 3.0: "I am inevitable."
1:27 please Bungie PvP hasn’t been balanced since 2018. Don’t kid yourselves.
I have mixed feelings on Solar now that it’s dropped. Bungie, on the super off chance that you ever read this, stop taking things out of the game, just add the new stuff in with our current toys. Things like Mortar Strike, Sun Warrior (the damage buff was good, that wasn’t the problem with Lorely), Playing with Fire, Benevolent Dawn (not having to choose between a healing grenade and a damage grenade, just having both).   I like what’s been added, but it comes at the cost of some of my favorite things, a lot like what happened with Void. Oh and also, please, tune the exotics better around the changes. No Backup Plans is actually garbage with Void 3, and I think Lorely suffered a similar fate. It was an issue, but it was a cool idea, but now it’s trash in PvP and pve.
I dont understand why tf this mfs decided not to give the literally gunslinger hunter a cloak of a idk? A gunslinger maybe? Its not bad but cmon compared to void 3.0 hunter armor, the 3.0 solar hunter armor looks dookie
Yo that finger snap is giving me major FMA vibes. Warlock are bow gonna be cosplaying as Roy Mustang
"It has to be balanced totally" Totally ...
Warlocks: The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand.
Colonel Mustang cosplay time
i wish i had access to that engine that yall use for destiny
honestly i love the new stuff but it rlly does seem like it's less efficient at ad clear than bottom tree dawnblade used to be, but we dont have access to all the fragments yet so i could be proven wrong with a specific one im eyeing  Update: turns out i was wrong, it can be sooooo much better at ad clear but it's more hands on and oh it's fun
This does absolutely nothing for me, to make me want to come back to destiny 2. Oh well... Hopefully u guys who are still playing like it, & have fun with it.
Being able to Roy Mustang my way through enemies as a Warlock main was not something I realized I needed in my life until now.
Ok but did you keep in hammer throw as a melee, did you change for better or for worse, just where is it?
Instead of making something new they just change animations of one that exist
Can’t wait to thanos snap calus
Yay more recycled weapons, it goes to show how lazy bungie is in not putting new weapons in the game
youve seen it on the energy drink can, youvr plsyed the first level that leads to the field arena. NOW ARE YOU FINALLY READY TO ACTUALLY PLAY DESTINY 2
I guess I'm maining Titan this season?
Warlock: Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang 😄🔥
It's like if our guardians started to get creative with their powers and then you have the hunters who's like "you want one granade here have three"
Not that excited actually as a D1 Warlock main Titan second. It seems you nerfed the solar hammer pick up process and warlock still didn't get comp for what solar abilities we lost. Also I was banned for making a respectful comment on your public stances and was banned......censorship is cancer and I hope you don't keep promoting yours to grow. Silencing me is sad and Sony took a perfect stance by asking both sides to respect each other...you should take a Que.....I am not religious either so please remove that assumption.
Finally! I can understand what's going on power wise, titan solar main go!
Why does this look like they filmed it in a hotel room?
I love solar 3.0, but y'all *gutted* healer warlock. Completely ruined my favorit builds.
Titan with dual wield hammers? Kratos has joined the chat.
Roy Mustang has entered chat.
Good shlt but leviathan is recycled content 💀
Season of the warlocks *
Warlock got nerfed and is pretty lackluster.
Roy Mustang approves of Solar 3.0.
just kinda sad you can't do the radiant dodge midair
this shit sucks man
How did yall again fail to give Warlocks a way to attack with the sword outside of the super? Also, Pheonix Dive as a class ability? 🤡 🤡
That incinerator snap has me BRICKED
You guys come up with some incredible ideas, and let the Twitter mob determine how it’s adjusted. Let the shit be broken for a Season and adjust after accordingly.   Trust me, this game is beyond PVP. PVP shouldn’t be the end all be all for nerfs. An alternative; create PVP modes that enable gunplay and supers only.
Calling BS on not balancing at the cost of fun. As soon as we find something fun, Bungie nerfs it to death.
I can't wait to become thanos lmao
"Oh boy! I really liked Void 3.0, and the only thing that kind of annoyed me was that titans only got two supers, instead of reworking them into three unique supers like the other classes. I hope they make 3 different supers for the next titan subclass!" - Me, 20 seconds before getting to the 30 second mark.  Edit: Oh boy I didn't notice warlock, welcome to the club!
Good. Good. Just need arc now.
That finger snap is the most warlockiest thing to ever warlock.
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” ‭‭Colossians‬ ‭4:6‬ ‭NIV‬‬ K
Solar 3.0 looks amazing
Fullmetal alchemist???
Anybody else feeling like the flame alchemist with that snap 🥵
Looks like trash.
Wish they’d keep the void class options around though.  Just in case you enjoy the void play style more outside of seasonal activities.
You guys really thought divine protection needed a change, I’m extremely disappointed, healing grenade should only be on warlock and revert it back, it’s actually trash now, people already thought it was trash, before, add divine protection as a aspect, I do not care about flying as a healer, I can’t even save people from handcannons, y’all p…. Me off, I’ve main well of radians with starfire protocol for 4 years, you literally though it needed a nerf, change is a excuse, literally people got one shoted and before from snipers and shotguns and fusion rifle etc, it was literally balance, and you guys made the effects on the hand not all white, if I have to wait 90 days to get my stuff fixed😵‍💫🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲I actually cried, yah I could be considered a immature fool like the rest of the community but y’all are stupid for think all solar classes dersevered too  be able to heal themself, I was the one healing, it’s crap  All I wanted was the guiding flame melee to be changed and maybe a buff to divine protection , or I could still play as a healer, now my build is even more trash then people already thought about it was, wrong choice guys your ruined well mains which is rare to the ground cuz of your symmetry bull**** Pls revert it back I didn’t wait 90 days to get my build need or 4 years, because y’all wanna be different, divine protection fragment should just cancel heat rises, I should be able to still use fusion grenades and heals on starfire protocol Extreme disappointment and sadness,  All the crap I got from players before well buff and boots of assembler, was alsways saying I’m dumb and it’s useless when, I knew how to use it, not just for over shield, healing🤕🤕🤕🤕 also placed in front of me waiting for a gunfight then walk while shooting into divine protection, I was good, but not op, y’all are stupid, and my insults should not stop you from reverting it back
Here 200% for the warlock snap
Titans: do more damage Warlocks: burn all and heal Hunters: "my weapons now do damage but is funny warlocks melee is better than my grenade"
Compared to void 3.0 i think solar 3.0 is actually gonna be FUN
so that pastebin leak was true
I really don't know how this game can treat 1 class so much like trash and keep going. Poor hunter.
Honestly solar 3.0 is underwhelming. Not mention having two aspects I can’t even equip even though I purchased all of them.
Genius!! Loving destiny 2. Right now it's the best it's ever been ( without Activision)
my only question left is: is blade barrage good yet
"It always has to be fun. If its not fun, take it out." -Bungie, Halo Era.  "It has to be balanced, totally, but never at the expense of fun." -Bungie, modern Destiny Era
Good job guys, you didn’t fuck over warlocks. I’m quite happy with this.  Edit: turns out well doesn’t give overshield anymore, making it a death trap to use, And DB doesn’t extend on kills anymore, making it short af. And the only method we have to heal isn’t even unique to us. Not to mention making icarus dash it’s own aspect for no reason and not giving us a healing aspect.
👍👍👍
they shit on warlocks.
Is solar 3.0 live now?
Gunslinger ( solar hunter ) main here, I LOVE THIS SOLAR 3.0 ITS THE BEST EVER!!
Let’s go
I am a diehard solar titan, but the snap is really cool
fire and thats it
Whoever had the flame snap idea for WL no doubt likey FMA lol. Must of been on a rewatch binge haha. Rad.
This looks super badass, unfortunately knowing me I'd probably only choose fragments that give boost to stats, but still super cool nonetheless
Warlocks should've had something better than a damn (snap of fingers)like wtf guys yall serious 😒  mind is blown where the hell was the creative thinkers
I was so excited for this season...then I found out fucking auto rifles got a champien mod for the 3rd seasonin a row! There are no words to describe my disgust with bungie for this decision. An entire season ruined before it even started.
Great video! 👍👍
Hunters it's time to dust off our Celestial Nighthawks.
Yup not going back to PVP after this. Solar Titan is cracked
For void 3.0 y'all did devour a little dirty. Not only you can't self proc the devour but you guys shaved off a whole second. It's not 10 seconds of devour it's 9 now. All the other buffs would last until they fully hit zero. For devour, it only lasts until 1 on the timer. Not to mention the timer doesn't fully reset per kill but that's just my whiny complaint  Same thing applies for the extended devour, you don't get 15 seconds it's actually 14. Please give devour it's 1 second it rightfully deserves.
Well *somebody* mains Ashe in Overwatch...
Yall just turned warlocks into roy mustang
So warlocks turn into Colonel Mustang. I’m jealous.
I can’t wait to hop on and see this because I main solar on my hunter for the feel of a gunslinger
Can someone tell me what the music at 2:52 is? I can't remember where it's coming from, maybe a raid?
I love everything that you guys have done lately, I even found fun in Stasis, but Solar Warlock is ruined in my eyes. Bottom tree got practically deleted which was one of my favorite trees in the game and Dawn Chorus gor reworked. Also Heat Rises and Touch of Flame have zero synergy because they both require your grenade for it's own effect.
Never thought I'd be Thanos snapping enemies in Destiny.
I’m so hyped for my warlock to go full Mustang with that fire snap 😩😩
I don't know, but the snap effect just seems so awesome. Even if it doesn't do that much damage I will be satisfied XD
I hate this game and bungies greed but I have to say void 3.0 was amazing and solar 3.0 looks even better honestly. Its amazing what your devs can do bungie when you actually put your effort into something thats not eververse..
hunters stay losing
That’s crazy but can I get Arc 3.0 ):
bungo, you made the average day of a Bioshock fan, a little sweeter, thank you very much
Incinerator snap: Roy Mustang from Fullmetal Alchemist
So I'm already excited because of the Titan ability
I'm crying with happiness seeing this. Finally, men making games for men. Men who understand me. Men who know how we love to play. Men who create and support one another. Please, Bungie, keep this up. This has made my day in so many ways than one. I even had to share with my gf. Destiny makes me happy. I've played destiny everyday since 2015. Everyday. I thought I was losing a game I love to work feminist mob. This pleases me so much. Godspeed.
So hunter gets a thanos snap? oh ok
The warlocks snap looks very satisfying and excellent reference/callback to BioShock..
So the warlocks are the only class that’s getting something completely new. Nothing new here
I love that my fav element arc is being left for last :(
This is going to be SO AWESOME!
Alright. Hyped. 👌
2:50 YEESSSSS HAHAHA YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
Void was my least favorite sub, and after the change i main it with my hunter, im eager to see what you´ve done with my former main sub.
Just jumped on for a bit at lunch and god dam seeing 3 or 4 titans using giant burning hammers to melt the living fuck out of bosses while I’m in the back as a hunter making the team radiant while throwing a giant ass pipe bomb at enemies was something else…
The only thing that's bittersweet, hearing the devs talk about w.lock healing being the best. But for raids, isn't giving each player their own burst heal kinda make wells redundant? Bc you can throw it at the feet of your guardian and easily catch 2-3 teamates while they go in & out the bubble
Yes! Solar 3.0 for the win!
Idk about you guys,but hunters without the invisibility seems so wrong. Warlocks are incredible with Solar 3.0.   Not looking forward for arc 3.0. Flying Raijin will be the clear meta for titans to use.
I am become Colonel Mustang!!!!!
That warlock snap really gives off Bioshock vibes.
I thought I quit. Looks like I'm coming back...
Is that tex mechanica shirt going to be at the bungie store??
Man I'm excited to be Roy Mustang from FMAB
che schifezza
I feel like the Titan’s new Solar ability sets them up to get head-shotted.
Incinerator snap letting warocks cosplay as Roy mustang is the actual biggest improvement in destiny history though, Roy was that guy in FMA and to have such a classy attack thrown in, it makes me cry😭
Finally, my sunbracers r gonna be insane
I never used titan but the fact that you can cancel the slam, is a gamer changer for comp pvp.
Oh lord last word dynamite combo is gonna be so crisp
I’m a Hunter main & was kinda debating on making the switch to Warlock because of Void 3.0 but after this I’m definitely making the switch to Titan this season
Dawn chorus and path of the burning steps about to be broken
Dead game 4 dead people
Бля взрослые мужики.
Solar Warmind Titan on standby. Ready to raze the world.
Give us a siva season.
Hail Titania
If Fikrul comes back:  Warlocks: "That's enough! You were STUPID enough to confess, and even MORE stupid to BOAST! Everything you've said is fuel on your funeral pyre! So then, I think I'll begin... BY BURNING OUT YOUR TONGUE!"
i’ll be honest, i don’t like how the new heal-nades are just healing.  Before you could choose wether to be offensive or risk the extra seconds to be defensive and try and heal you and/or teammates.  Sure more options for all classes but less options during gameplay.
once more it seems like hunters got the short end of the stick.
Man warlock is just mediocre now   Phoenix dive just sucks and is not worth using   The new melee is laughably slow and low damage  and grenade functionality is locked behind an aspect   Not only you didn't bring sunsinger back, you nerfed well, and all its neutral game, you also destroyed an already meh super with dawnblade without everlasting flame.   And I see these changes and say, why? The feedback and ideas were already there by the community. But y'all just made whatever you want cause "it's *their* game".   Well what you did is mediocre, and that's *"my* take"  And I know I'm being very petty and salty right now. That's why I'm commenting now instead of later. When all my anger has dried out and Ill just comment "it's meh, and I'm sad for the missed opportunity"
Yall murdered Gunslinger. Yall reworked Knock em down and now its ass. Its nothing like what it used to be. I loved bottom tree golden gun and its just gone now. Solar hunter = MASSIVE fail. Hope we can get that changed back cuz thats a huge mistake. Knock em down was the identity of Gunslinger for me and now I have 0 interest in playing the subclass.
someone is totally gonna make a warlock meme that says  IT DOSENT MATTER WE ALWAYS HAVE TO PLAY SUPPORT, JUST SNAP AWAY THE PAIN
Hunter becomes healer this season? Oh no...
Just a bit more mobility and this fps would be about perfect.
dislike for this obvious racism
Ah yes, time to play as cornel mustang and burn my enemies with a snap.
This isn't the place for this but next update can we just get a spectator mode or a captured replay for PVE? It's hard to figure out how cool we look as a certified unit
Ok That Warlock Ability Though
MP, or anyone else, please: make a clip with warlock snap x Honkai impact 3rd cinematic with Herrscher of the Void. I'll pay my likes for this
Wheres my Will to Live 1.0 Bungie I need it
Still till this day idk why vanilla D2 didnt launch with the same skill tree as D1 would of been perfect
I know everyone creaming about that new titan slide, but that hunter super trip mine bundle is gonna destroy.
Okay... Leviathan? Ich zahle also erneut für alten content neues geld. Respekt Bungie.
Void was awesome. Solar looks insane. Cant wait for favorite Arc to get 3.0
*hmmm skyburners oath???????*
Give hunters the ability to run on walls for a short time before needing to jump to another wall to run on it too so they can be full on ninjas. Also give blink back to hunters please! Bring back Destiny 1 blade dancer!
All I can say is WOW
1:29 it only counts if OTHER PEOPLE are having fun. You arent gonna give yourself an F. 🤣
Props to bungie for making my warlock thanos😂
Titan being the intended god of damage class again.....why am I not surprised :/
3:12 that reminds me of Phoenix from valorant, where he snaps and does fireball stuff
the titan melee animation seemed kinda slow and boring after the uppercut
wooow🔥 thank you destiny ❤
So Gunpowder gamble is literally Ashe's Dynamite ability from Overwatch, so I can't give much credit to them for coming up with it. That said it does fit extremely with the Hunter style and its a pretty decent addition to their solar kit.
Can’t wait to pull out vex out of my vault
Dang it, I wanted Arc 3.0 so I could make fun of my brother who never changes off bottom arc titan
So... As a warlock, I can cosplay Roy Mustang now? Bet. Say no more.
The fire snap is just awesome XD
Love how they say they''ve never done anything like the titan slide/slam and they didn't know if they even could. And I'm like.... Did you forget you gave hunters both of those already?
EHEHHEHEHEEHEE TITAN FIRE PONCH
wow fire effects… amazing… bungie died a long time ago.
Aaaaand of course arc 3.0 is last. Go figure….
I truly cannot wait for Arc 3.0 I really hope they go all out for arc since it has been so bad for awhile now
Hold up. Icarus dash and icarus slam(idk whats its called) gonna be broken
And that folks is why PvP will continue to suffer
Where is radiance?
Maybe with this update the dawn chorus might be good
THEY COPIED THE CAMMYCAKES STRAT
Scythe had promise then immediately ruined
They are finally putting the fantasy in the power fantasy and I am here for it
boutta make a thanos build for my warlock 😂
Next arc 3.0💪💪
Hive- We won't tell you anything you will have to kill us  warlock- All I have to do is snap my fingers and you will soon be screaming what I want to hear.
i will be rather upset if my empowered melee is gone
WARLOCKS GET FLAME ALCHEMY????
The bundle grenade is the most hunter-y grenade I think possible
(for warlock) is starfire protocol getting changed so that we can have 2 healing nades because right now it only works with fusion nades
Hunters got shafted bad. Lmao.
can we get our dlcs back
I can hear the crucible screaming.
I shall from here on out referre to the consecration as “GO DIRECTLY TO HELL”
But is Shin Malphur making a return??? GOLDEN GUN IS BACK BABYY
As a rootin tootin last word totin’ gunslinger, I couldn’t be happier with the gunpowder gamble. Cheers d2
The warlock snap reminds me of Roy Mustang from Full Metal Alchemist
I just really hope crow isn’t featured much. Feeling like I was being forced to care about him made me quit last season. And I LOVED last season. I’ll power through this time. Good job guys looks great
I stopped playing after getting all my Witch queen stuff done, but seeing this is definitely gonna make me hop on and start messing with different kinds of solar builds
Solar mains, how we feelin'?
I didnt know people still play destiny 2. It was a dumbed down version of destiny (an actual good game). I played 1500 hrs of destiny, i sold destiny 2 after playing it for 30hrs. 💩
So we're not gonna talk about the scythe😒😒😒😒😒😒
the three trip mine duct tape hit box is fuckin MASSIVE!!!!!!!  wtf fix it >:(
pheonix dive plus icarus dash?!?
اللهم لا افتقر وانت ربي ولا اهلك وانت رجائي
Many papa blesses.
Titans with their medieval hammers, Warlocks with their medieval broad swords, and Hunters with their…. Medieval… desert eagles…
I was blown away by the void 3.0 rework and now I am just as excited to mess around with solar and arc 3.0
iT HaS TO bE BalANcEd 🤡
Oh my God everyone its happejng! Its happening!!
Wow more reused content and locations 😒
I miss Bungie’s “Fun” philosophy in Halo.
Finally get to live as colonel mustang
Just give me eliksni guardians playable and I'm coming back.
If Sunbracers still work similarly to how the functioned before, carpeting the landscape in Solar nades that belch fireballs will be a new level of add clear fun. Very excited to see how this pans out
I've been maining only top tree downblade & sun bracers . Now that they will be, being used more . Please don't nerf them
If incinerator snap isnt the coolest shit ever then idk
Ya know I always imagined Guardians could be flashier lore-wise, especially with lore stories like Savin the guardian who frequently killed himself by experimenting with his abilities trying to create cool new moves.  Now we can live out a bit more of that customizable fantasy!  By comparison Arc 3.0 needs to get here soon though, literally every other subclass is ballin' outta control!
Нет бы электричество переработать и сделать так что бы за него играли.
Warlock cosplay as Roy Mustang when?
GIVE IT TO ME
The painfully canned "OHHH IT'S THE TWOFER!" hahahaha.  Still, looking so forward to that Titan uppercut/slam.
God crucible will just become a graphics card test bench now. I am both excited and dreading its future.
LOL at these nerdy a** comments, you people need to take a break.
Ofc arc would be last for renovation mannnnnn
This is AWESOME ! omg i love destiny
Colonel Mustang!!
People ask me why I love Destiny… LOOK AT THE MATERIAL! I can’t wait to get home to play with my boys.
Warlock: I am inevitable
Time to bring out shards again
Arcathanos !
Astounding how devs were giddy and beyond excited to "have fun" with the Titans and Hunters and then super unenthusiastic about Warlocks (and it shows). Hey Bungie devs, when will you stop hating on us Warlocks?
Cool so titan big damage warlock best of both worlds and hunters nothing dope love to see it 🤣
Well void titan was painful and solar with the helmet was also painful, now they are looking like Thor diluent wielding in endgame
Thanks for taking away the spoils farm I’m sure you really needed to do that Bungie. You really love fun….
Any other FMA fans exicted about that Incinerator Snap? Gonna feel like Colonel Mustang up in here
did I just see a warlock icarus dash and Phoenix dive?
oh yeah boyz we turn pvp in to the wwe
Oh, so they added the Cammy Cakes grenade. Cool.
I'm so excited and it looks like hunters will be into guns but also buffing
My solar sunshot build is ready.   Tho, with all that AOE, i hope we get less champion heavy missions and more ads so AOE and crowd control is actually useful
So in other words, Bungie watched CammyCakes play with Trip Mines and decided to implement it as a feature. Haha.
Kinda jealous warlocks get to be Roy Mustang
What warlock is not gonna use Mustangs snap
These look awesome but I’m Afraid that some of these abilities will be too powerful for pvp and will be nerfed… which will hurt pve players once again.
New hakke smg leaked?
Oh so you don't have to be entirely accurate with the trip mine cuz it has a large hit box
Our time will come arc enjoyers
They put some thought into these changes which I love to see. It'll be a fun season.
This is awesome but I'm sorry to ask when arc?
finally get to experience what it was like to be cayde-6, a badass hunter frontflips, titan hulk smash, and warlock thanos snap, HYPED
Well I'm ready to burn the world 😈
Something to watch while waiting for other 15k pep b4 me to either got in, or dropped off the line
This looks... awesome.
Cayde wouldn't have lost if he had solar 3.0
They really turned warlocks into roy mustang
Void im sorry but solar may replace you 💔
So excited for fav subclass !!
I am so exited for a new season. But I can't Afford it😔
Titan: goes Reinhardt mode Warlock: Colonel Mustang finger snap Hunter: hot potato time  Me, I just wanna be like the Warlock. FMA xD
I went up 15 level ranks last night had 4 hours left of the season
Yo did the devs take inspiration in FullMetal Alchymist?
that warlock melee 100% had some Roy Mustang inspiration
Titans will destroy all other classes beware you weak Hunters and Warlocks!
DUDE I am so hyped for this.  Cannot wait to live that Gunslinger fantasy.
From the Warlock solar aspect "Touch of Flame": "Fusion grenades explode twice." This is 100% death in PvP.
0:36 I wish he said....so you can kill other guardians in PVP like you previously couldn't have imagined. The PVP mode in this game needs sooooo much more work than the PVE side of things...
Imagine being just a tester amongst the Bungie team… passionate mfs ☝️💪
WHY IS THE TITAN'S NEW SOLAR MELEE SO COOL?????
It will be nerfed next time once they see how it goes in PvP. Just from the look of it, its going to insane in the Crucible. It honestly looks fun but Bungie always goes all out on a subclass then regrets it a month down the road.
What’s with the scythe though ???
*squeals with excitement 😁
lmao, warlocks got the roy mustang 🫰
this is what I would’ve given to solar 3.0 in a best case scenario, the team killed it. Incredible work
bouta thanos snap everyone to death in crucible
Titans: Thor but fire Hunters: Billy the Kid Warlocks: Roy Mustang
Can't wait for pvp youtubers bitch and whine about solar 3.0 and immediately demand nerfs
Seeing the warlock snap his fingers made me wanna watch full metal alchemist
Man... Warlocks got the anime reference...
3:03 Roy Mustang in Destiny 2? LET'S GOOOOOO
the snap made me load so hard, warlock gang. love you too titans and hunters
Listen, Im a sunbreaker through and through. My heart is a molten ball of magma. But that Roy Mustang snap on the warlock is so damn cool. ~flame alchemist warlock intensifies~
ICARUS DASH LIVES ON YES!!!!!!!!
Us fans are just so darn lucky. Thank you Bungie!!!
Give us that TEST ROOM… and GunSlinger > any subclass always been
As main Hunter I feel robbed once again
Hope there’s more for hunters cuz that was wack
DMT, payload in Vow and now this grenade? Ashe mains rejoice.
They added CammyCakes tripmine trick to the game!!!!!!
Lets hope the class throphies are finaly obtainable again, damn bugs
Real question: Does now lorely splinter (or whatever that titan helmet was) give overshield?     Also judging by this arc 3.0 would be awesome too
I better still be able to throw my hammer
Gotta love how the entire design team is warlocks, silly dev team.
Hoping this brings eveyone (including me) back to the game, I miss it, but beyond light really killed it for me, praying for a comeback
3:03 someone at Bungie is definitely a FMA fan lmao
PLEASE BRING BACK FIRST CURSE HAND CANNON
Nothing worse than a fireteam all using the same element.
Can the warlock get a healing buddy 😇
Who else is downloading the update and watching this?
I'm glad they're at least saving the best subclass 3.0 for last.
AHHHHHHHH I THOUGHT THIS WASNT COMING OUT FOR ANOTHER YEAR IM SOLD
Ay yes keep titans broken 🤦🏼‍♂️
Good fucking job man
When Arc 3.0 comes out us hunters better feel like Killua or sumn
So Roy Mustang Warlock???
I don't even know what to say. Sometimes I hate being an adult and having responsibilities lol. I just want to go and play!!!!
There new pvp maps yet?
So Hunters just get an easier shot on their grenade. Wow.  Meanwhile Titan gets an uppercut and  slam, a combo that can probs kill a whole team. And Warlocks get a Thanos snap.  When does Hunter get something cool for once lol
Warlocks are now LITERALLY Roy Mustang
“That balance can never come at the expense of fun” Bungie Devs so far have been too scared to intentionally release a core game mode that enables guardians to fulfill their power fantasies of crushing, shocking, shattering, or incinerating everything as shown in this reveal.   All for the sake of "balance."     Fun can be had outside of chasing loot and overcoming tough challenges, especially when the challenge is only difficult due to artificial difficulty added through power level inflation.
I can confirm as a titan main, we do want to see the world burn
It may be hard to put my Titan down for this season for a Warlock.
"That balance can never come at the expense of fun" yet we've spent the past few years being angry because they nerf the pve fun for pvp balance
Oh god the titan armor ahhhhh
This has to be one of the most braindead takes out there
Insterested to see how Icarus dash is gonna work
That new titan ability looks like its playing bury the light at the good part
Oh I so gonna love the twin hammer strikes melee, aka going Kratos God of War like they are Chaos Blades!
This dude talking about a ground slam attack as if its never been done before, let alone never been done in destiny. Fuck right off. Retard devs.
So titans are broken AGAIN and hunters got? A grenade? How lame tbh :/ really wanted some fun spicy hunter solar melee and nothing even close
LEVI!
Y'all ready to feel the burn ❤️‍🔥. Solar mains stand up!
SUNSPOT AND THROWING HAMMER LESSGOOOOOOOOO
2:30  OMG!  That's the Overwatch Ashe dynamite mechanic!  I love that Bungie is taking inspiration from the gameplay of some truly great games and popular culture and making it their own.  (Lorentz Driver suck kind of reminds me of old Orisa halt.  How could you not think of Thanos when you see Incinerator Snap?)
Wait, did they make a titans melee into a Razelighter with a slam?
If only Cayde could see this 😭
All I ask is for the fan base to be objective when playing this. Some of this stuff seems super cool while other stuff, not so much.  Everyone is gonna have an opinion so let’s do better at having productive conversations this go around, shall we?
Feels like hunters always gets the most plain abilities compared to the others like oh cool I can throw a thing of dynamite but the titan can fucking smash shit with two hammers and the warlock snaps out a sun I'm hoping arcs finally gets something else besides the lighting stick part 2
I love this game 🖤🖤🖤
It's so cool to see behind the scenes footage!
gonna start calling my Warlock Colonel Mustang. that fire snap is DOPE.
hunters straight up just have a pipebomb now
SOLAR HELL YEAH
“That balance can never come at the expense of fun” Not the best track record with this one.
I used to main solar then swapped to stasis and declared my guardian couldn't use light subclasses, now I have to come up with self lore for how thishappens and it gets solar back lol
The fact that they continue to ignore "Self Rez" for the warlock is terrible.  It was such a fun super in D1.  So much strategy with it.  I get it broke the game in a lot of ways as it was exploited for a number of glitches but still.  I miss it.
The armor dude holy shit I am going to nut
Looks like sunspots will no longer provide an increase in weapon damage. At least it wasn’t in the description.
As much as I'll miss Celestial Fire, I am absolutely loving the idea of Incinerator Snap. So much style.
Gunpowder Gamble plus Last Word  Oh Lord no
Can Hammer of Sol smack people again and if not, can it happen?
now, keep your mouth SHUT on politics!
I hope the new hunter abilities are better than they look  They don't look too hot ngl. Especially compared to that magnum dong of a slam that Titans get
We get the Roy Mustang snap, I'm all for it
My friend would have loved this. Thank you for giving him such a fun game to play and allowing us to have something to remember him by.
The took s elite skill of shooting a triine and made so it takes alot less skill
No more well please I wanna run my warlock without being ask to run well 🥲
How, Gunslinger now can easily perform Cammy throw :D
I'm making my Warlock a Colonel Mustang cosplay  AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
I'm over here giggling at the Titan 2 hammer slam. It's just so cool
Sunnnn. Shot babyyyy
Uhhh 3:07 a solar posterity?? Are we getting switching elements back??
I just can't wait until arc 3.0
Hallowfire Heart gonna be fun this season, especially with aspects and fragments reducing cooldowns. Titans gonna have a field day with both Ad clear and boss DPS.
Sunshot hunter build is gonna be my first I try out
The snap is giving Roy Mustang from FMA and I could not be more hype. Everything looks great
Warlocks are now Mustangs!
Could be... maybe a bug or glitch... but found it weird that the Solar Titan only had one option for barricade? 0:37
Perfect armor and perfect solar 3.0 abilities, Bungie never disappoints me for sure. Except for pvp sadly.
I really hate how fat these ppl are n sound , stop tryna hype it up n just talk normal . None of these devs get any booty
is the snap the only melee option for warlock?
Yeah I really hoped that we could Icarus dash and Phoenix dive at the same time guess what solar 3.0
Hopefully solar 3.0 means a buff to blade barrage because man does it feel sad to you use now and it was my favorite
It's so much fun to get these insights. It also allows us to see some of the wonderful faces and bright minds working on this game! So excited for season 17!
I am so happy I can be more of a cowboy then I am
Ngl i feel like warlocks got the crumbs at the bottom of the bag
I'm running sunbracers with that solar warlock melee I'm gonna be Roy Mustang
Welcome to we broke crucible again: solar edition
Titan - Impressed.  Hunter - O_O Warlock - *SHOOK*  (Hunter main haven’t played since beyond light.)
I like that the vortex type grenades all have their own identity with the change to solar grenades - Vortexes pull enemies in, Duskfields slow more than they damage, and now Solars also spew smaller fires. With that change Sunbracers will be really fun to use now that I think about it lol
So no self res what a bummer
if you read the Sol invects aspect for titans it doesn't mention any weapon damage boost i think they removed increased damage from sunspots
Bungie be like, "Disappointed with the remake of Stephen King's 'Firestarter'? We got you covered 😉👉👉"
It’s dumb asf having to wait till 6pm.
Bro that snap from Fullmetal alchemist hahahha. better dont try to use it in rain tho
Damn I’m a hunter main and i really wish we got incinerator snap 😭😭😭
Idc whether it’s balanced or not…quite honestly the new supers and abilities look freakin insane! So excited for this season 17!!!!!!
WE GET 5 FRAGMENT SLOTS. OH HUNTERS ARE EATING GOOD THIS SEASON
Warlock makes my roy mustang fantasy come true :D
Ηunters got shit on
Titan: dual hammers  warlock: *snap*
My Warlock will now be known as Colonel Mustang 🫰🔥
1. Warlocks OP 2. Titans fun 3. Hunter sweat 😓
Self res?
I'd love to return,in fact came back to it a month ago,played for 1hr and Uninstalled after releasing are you serious? Ya'll went FTP but gutted the game becuz you want,40$ for this 25$ for that..oh you want season pass? Tough shit 10$,can't even do strikes or a nightfall the most standard thing to do in Destiny cuz if it's a stage you don't have cuz ( missing dlc ) welp can't do it
I'll start my warlock's Roy Mustang cosplay. Thanks Bungie
ROY MUSTANG WARLOCK WTF
Picked the game back up for Witch Queen, after watching this trailer and the excitement for this new season. Truly a great time to be playing Destiny. See you in the matrix Guardians.
Pvp is going to be an absolute shitshow lol
I can finally live my fantasy to be Roy Mustang.
But how does this help women kill babies?
Warlocks are flame alchemists confirmed
Does no one get Roy mustang vibes from the warlock snap??
Dude warlocks are turning into Thanos now
"that balance can never come at the expense of fun" remember that for ur next hunter nerf guys
New dodge for hunter?
i see so warlocks can channel their inner roy mustang from full metal alchemist then *finger snap*
20 minutes
Thank you for this birthday gift Bungie. Now I can be Revolver Ocelot 3.0.
That Armor has to be some of the best they've put brought out so far
Why do hunters NEVER get ease of use?!!! So I gotta be CammyCakes and shoot my grenade outta the air, while warlocks can snap their fingers and titans get a upgraded slide uppercut thats solar.  Lets count how many times people are gonna miss shooting their grenade in actual combat, versus missing a finger snap or slide uppercut shall we?!
As a solar hunter main, I approve
Yet it always has come at the expense of fun. I hope this is a new regimen you’ll be following from now on.
I wish they made the ‘practice makes perfect’ buff to extend to any nearby teammate.
Did I just witness an Icarus Dash followed by a Phoenix Dive at 3:34?
solar warlocks bout to become thanos with that snap
Icarus dash with Phoenix dive is so toxic…ACTUALLY can rival hunter movement WITH a healing shatterdive. If you thought hunters played bitchy, you haven’t seen anything yet…
Exactly, warlocks always gotta be support. Very fun indeed.
Icarus dash into phoenix dive....op af
Looks fucking sick!
I can't believe the Cammycakes trickshot is now a feature
0:33 Healing. Grenades. Huh?
Too bad yall gotta focus purely on new gen console bunch of cocksuckers I've had to re-download the content packs for this bullshit game 9 times since this witch queen launch BUNGO YOU SUCK
This is basically destiny 3 at this point lol
as always the titan is the coolest then hunters and warlocks just trash
Gib arc 3.0 pls
So hyped
INCINERATOR SNAP
i was hoping for arc 3.0...
They put primaries in their normal spot
thanks for your hard work devs. respect
the cammycakes special actually made it into the game as a feature, wow
Titans: _I only know how to hammer stuff, so you're the nails I'm about to hit_ Hunters: Pull out a MacGyver and duck tape everything Warlocks: Literally Thanos **S N A P P**
I get to Roy mustang trash mobs, yes plz 😂😊❤
Nobody gonna mention they made an aspect that gives you max handling after dodging so what’s the point of dragons shadow then
My Warlock just turned into Roy Mustang
Can’t wait to trick out my Gunslinger Hunter with a hand cannon focus and explosions everywhere with Sunshot and chain reactions.😎🔥
Trichromatica ghost shell was right🥳
Titans get these cool double hammers that are graded ad clear to a lot of damage warlocks get this cool snap that is also really good for ad clear and does insane damage to a single target… And hunters get a trip mine but two of them
thank you so so much for still letting us have phoenix dive
Warlocks can be like Thanos out here... Praise the Bungie Gods 🙌🏾🙏🏾
cant wait for some random guy in their basement to create a build day one where everything you look at explodes.
Crucible is gonna be lit! xD
Still no Exile gear?
they should release a testing ground
So Roy Mustang is a guardian
SOOOOO are y’all making blade barrage great again? Like fuck the people bitching about blade barrage😒that shit barely kills anything now! Completely destroyed the shards of galanor
I’ll tell ya this right now.. Sunbracers are gonna be broken as shit when this season launches
Titans we up
I tought I knew how they’re gonna change Loreley but if they made Lory the only way to get the sun warrior buff then Phoenix cradles wouldn’t be worth a damn so I’m really interested to see how they rework it
My warlock going to be looking like Roy mustang now.
Damn, I was hoping for self-res returning but it still looks fun
Gosh this game has come so far.
Did I just see them give dawnnalde even more movement by being able to slam into the ground wtf
If your 50 miles fron your destination and you're driving 50 mph and every mile you decrease your by 1 mph, how long will it to drive that 50 miles?
Once again I hate the hunter changes. I don't want to press a button to do an animation that has an effect. I want to press a button that has an effect.
YOOOOOO! This is FIRE! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pun intended!
Sooo by the sounds of it they are implying that well of radiance might lose the damage buff and the hunters might actually get a way to buff the team damage output instead.
bruh what imagine arc gonna be like
that titan melee is going to be gross in pvp
Damn warlock got a thanos snap , titan got a kratos slam and hunters BOOM goes the dynamite
The best subclass finally getting an update.
The warlock snap is pure Roy Mustang energy and i *love* it
Balance can never come at the expense of fun.... so thats why yall thought loreley was a good idea thanks for that
Roy Mustang warlock.
ARC ARC ARC ARC ARC ARC
*silent but excited warlock noises*
Someone liked full metal alchemist 3:02
Great job team legit can't wait to hop on after work my solar titan is gonna be so much fun 🙌🙌🙌
Can titans yell ‘shoryuken’ when they jump?
Warlocks becoming flames alchemists
Destiny is just an American anime you can't change my mind Warlocks: Roy Mustang but Cleric Hunter: Cowboy with explosions Titan: Paladin with explosions
Can’t wait for Arc 3.0 bring back the blade dance
So what I'm seeing is I can mow slot Icarus Dash and phoenix dive together... 👀
Why no self res warlock
oh no, rip pvp xD
If you took away throwing hammers I will cry
and to think after my shift I get to go home and fall in love with my sunbreaker titan all over again
Gimme weighted knife on  six-shooter Goldie
The Warlock snap is the best audio -visual things in D2 hands down !!!!
Warlocks: "You should've gone for the head..."
Legal :)
I love the bioshock vibe from the incinerator snap
Arc is looking hecka weak now. Titans literally have a double solar wave melee
Go go gadget pipe bomb!
I feel like sun warrior was taken away based on some of this. Hmmmm.
Ah yes warlocks are Roy mustang now
Video Summary: Kill it with fire.
Haven’t played for awhile but this, this is epic
let me guess. hunter has solar eye sight so when he looks at you in PVP you are dead
Hey, I want my hunter to Thanos snap scorn too. Why can't I have that?
whoever thought of the warlock snap is a fan of FMA !!
Let's fuckin gooooo
Roy mustang has entered the game
Just hope to god it unlocks like void did. I cant be arsed with all this tedious stasis quest unlocks.
Pog
Bruh I'm so done either this game, hunters super is better for weapon damage? Seriously 😂... so it's time to main a titan and warlock.
warlock here finger snap is awesome from what I've seen so far. the well can it be pulled up and be used as a dawnblade one use then the super would deactivate?  my next, is meant to be a little funny but I also would like it if I could use the other classes aspects and fragments so one of the things I can use as a seller Warrior buff that the Titans get. the building of the hunters of being able to throw a grenade and being able to shoot it would be handy, I still may not be Dexter's enough to accomplish it. the last thing I have to say is why do you assume I must be an archangel,  if I can find a way I will attempt to healing or repair when I can like the eliksni prophecy says.   I am angry at the forces of the darkness we're continuing to try to encroach  on our right to exist.  I know the traveler will eventually be taken down but on that day I will probably become on Lynch of the light.  become a day let the pyramid-ships should regret they should already know my response is no how would you like being the last one of your kind I am not going to give you the of death like you want cuz that's what you want.  I am someone I have to watch over cuz they help me and my darkest time supposedly cuz it's yet-to-be  when I wrote this.
Roy mustang lol warlocks
Still wish sentinel got a mace or axe and shield
"Incinerator Snap"  Which one of you at Bungie is the Fullmetal Alchemist fan???
Trust me, is over once we all enter the crucible
:56 Burn the World, 1 hr into new Season, Gotta nerf titans man someone found out that if they're in air and an ally walks under them they can build up so much solar energy that can impact fulls maps doing 1 million damage. -someone who hates Titans (I am a Titan Main, I'm meme ing)
Beautifully edited synopsis. Excited to try it.
All I care about is I got what I want. Using Roaring Flames and generating sunspots at the same time. Good shit!
Our power fantasy as a hunter is duct tape….
12k likes and only 4k views on the video? Something definitely doesn't add up here🤔 And I'm willing to bet some these comments with over hundreds of likes, are not even real people at all. *DISGUSTING!*
God fucking damnit, I'm obligated to level warlock because of the snap now. Huge fucking bioshock vibes.
I'm gonna shoot
I'm gonna be so pissed if they have removed icarus dash from warlock
LOVE the new trip mine! Been needing an update since d1! So glad hunter solar is gonna be interesting again
Warlock is my fav class.  Fullmetal Alchemist is one of my fav anime.  SO YOU TELLING ME I CAN BE ROY MUSTANG?!?
The art and sound teams have never failed in Destiny!
This WILL be broken on PVP, but I don't care, it will be fun to see the world burn until they nerf it
no lie i was expecting more for the hunters. but this shit is going to be extremely fun to use
If i hadn't seen Cammycakes shoot tripmines out of the the sky before the new nades would be cool.
Might be the best season so far, just for the subclass
Hunters look trash again.
I don't need it. I don't need it. I definitely don't need it. *see's titan hammer slam* I NEEEEEEEED IT!
Need a warlock melee where you swing the dawnblade in a quick hit
I love that they managed to get the chaotic nature of Hunters right  Hunters really would duct tape 3 explosives together-
You had my Titan main of a mother sold at adding a double hammer slam.  Her subsequent response: “hammer… HAMMER SMASH!!!”
I can feel PVP getting even messier... Changing is good, but as a PVP lover, a bit worried.
Roy Mustang is a warlock?
im gigglin like a fangirl out here
"YOU CAN DREAD IT, RUN FROM IT, DESTINY STILL ARRIVES, OR SHOULD I SAY, I HAVE. -HUNTER SOLAR MAIN-
THAT WARLOCK SNAP
Incinerator Snap  Aka warlock is Roy Mustang. Head canon now
Did the warlock just fuckin' one shoted a champion with a finger snap?
Now THIS is pod racing!
I can't wait for Arc 3.0 eventually!! <3 <3
My Titan is ready
Is Warmind Cell season!
Is there any reason to switch from Voidlock?  No. Is this still really cool? Fuck yes!
I hope we stop here with the changes lmao I'm not ready for the arc 3.0 it's gunna be aids in pvp, then again solar 3.0 might be as well we'll see.
ANTIOPE????
They fr added a cammycakes tripmine
Amazing Changes! Can't wait to play them! 😁
Call it as it truly is: Thanos Snap
FINALLY MY BLADE BARRAGE WILL BE GREAT AGAIN, THANK YOU D2 FUCKING THANK YOU!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!
Warlocks are basically Roy Mustang
Dude as a Warlock main, ima be snappin all you bitches!!!
UR TELLING ME, THAT I CAN MAKE MY WARLOCK INTO SEPHIROTH WITH THE FLAME SNAP?
Im actually really hyped for the solar update. Can't wait to see arc!
oooh can't wait to smash with my titan! 😍
On contrast to the lorely splendor, this new titan solar style looks like its meant to go in and go hard.
So the Warlock melee does ~3k damage and one-shots a barrier Champion?...🤔
Cammy cakes bouta be living the dream with the new trip mine grenadine
Anyone else *stoked* about the changes?
Gotta say hunters buffing if less than void super is semi useless if no stacking.  Hunter outside of a trip mine pretty much staying on void I'd guess more than likely same with warlock.
Finally somewhat decent armor design, just wish Bungie would drop the wokeness they keep spewing...
Duct taping 3 tripmines together to make a bigger explosive is the most Hunter thing I've ever seen  Cayde-6 would be very proud
Warlocks get the Incinerate Plasmid ? I understood that reference 😏
So I get to play out my Roy mustang fantasy as a warlock that makes me so happy
Did I just see a Warlock Icarus Dash and Phoenix Dive? Well, we all know what the trials meta is gonna be.
When I saw the warlock snap I immediately thought about Roy Mustang
Somebody on the dev Team has been watching Fullmetal Alchemist. I love this
I envy the warlocks finger snap *wink*   But I main titans so I am happy with what I got
ohhhh yeah
Aint gon' lie, I really wanted Arc but after seeing this, im SO excited to burn shit to da GROUND AHAA!!!
Guys, h AI 4th he if rb em j  Guys keheuuene  New crucible map.   NEW CRUCIBLE MAP
Warlocks about to be Roy Mustang. Which sounds amazing.
So, i still Dont know if blade barrage Will be decent to use again :/?
Warlock with icarus and Phoenix dive?  There's some movement
As a Hunter Main As long as I have all my knife options I’ll be fine with this 3.0
This commentary feels a lot more balanced imo.  I don't want to give out my feelings on the Hunter class yet, but this looks promising and it may make me want to main solar hunter again.
New take on the thanos snap nothing but ashes
There’s no fucking shot you can Icarus dash into a phoenix dive, what is this magic
warlocks stayin elegant and graceful titans still bonk, now with twice the bonk hunters... im not sure what we are but I know Cayde would be proud
Yoooo what is that armor???? Might return just for that 👀👀👀
They gave hunters an IED
I literally cant believe people think this game is bad.
Cayde would be so proud of the homemade sticky bomb.
Hunters buffing Weapon damage… this sounds like it won’t break pvp at all.
The tripmine is going to be cammys favorite for sure
So excited for this release! Go Bungie!
Welp time to make a Roy Mustang cosplay in Destiny because of that incinerator snap
Grenade spam with Hunter (not stasis) finally looks more realistic
Alright, solar looks great, now all we need is for Hunters to get blink jump back with Arc 3.0.
Changes to weapons/abilities made due to pvp imbalances which then affect pve is what really pisses me off about this game.
I’m going to Roy Mustang the hell out of everyone 😁
So yea...woo? You copied Titan Slam from Arc and turned it Solar....yay, even more to the point its basically the slam with the two handed maul with 3 waves of fire instead of 1...again...woo??
"Incinerator Snap"  Yall not slick lmao
3:34 that is all I wanted to know, if these three abilities stayed
Hope Titans and Hunters will icarus dash too I doubt it tho
COLONEL MUSTANG WARLOCK LETS GOOOOO
"it has to be balanced totally" yeah these guys dont play destiny do they
One more hour folks!!
where the hell are my rifts?
Soooooo they turned warlocks into Roy Mustang. Youre doing gods work Bungie. ☺️
Updated subclasses and no David Samuel sound effects.....SHAME, SHAME, SHAME
Burn away the fear in DESTINY 2 Season of the Haunted.
1:09 Archangels let's gooo
Someone from bungie is a Full Metal Alchemist fan because that Warlock snap is sooo Roy Mustang😊
HYPE
Dissapointing that hunters still have blade barrage. There was an opportunity to remove it and add the scythe as a super to replace it.
Bro made the nerdiest class into an cool and hot one
Dude, I'm a Hunter main but...that incinerator snap is the greatest idea of the video lol
Finally I can accurately cosplay Roy Mustang as a warlock
2:59 is that Antiope i see there???
The shots of our guardians in this vid are sick!! Can’t waitt
Lol, hunters got shafted 🤣
Please please please dont delete celestial fire
warlocks now have a pretty nerfed version of thanos snap xddd
I wonder how of some of the Exotic armour is going to work with Solar 3.0 and the new moves we can do. I can see some combos being pretty broken if they haven't been updated.
Warlocks gets new space magic so they happy, Titans get to smash stuff in new ways so they happy and hunters can heal dive so the pvp sweats are happy.
Hunter better get an updated melee for arc because its so trash
man this really makes void feel underwhelming even more
Why did you guys get rid of the bottom tree sunbreaker melee. It was literally the best way to make sunspots in pvp which you have even nerfed aswell. This new melee looks really cool but it’s useless in pvp because it’s so slow you will die before you hit the ground.
ROARING FLAMES AND SOL INVICTUS!!!!! MY DREAM CAME TRUE!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Well done guys...this is cool AF
I smell young ahamkara spine usage spiking with this update.
If you don't keep Icarus dash I will shoot myself. This isn't a threat it's a promise
They turned Warlocks into Roy Mustang. I love it
Antiope gameplay 🤨
3:15 Solar Warlocks are the Q from Star Trek now? Joke aside Solar 3.0 is dope as hell.
Warlocks getting that Colonel Mustang treatment 👌
But what about warlock solar buddy? :(
Noticed they purposely hid warlock’s second aspect. Hmmmmm -_-
Warlocks got the Roy Mustang!!!!!!
Running titan hammer slam with sun spots on beyblade titan is going to be crazy fun. Gonna feel like doomguy. Also Roy Mustang cosplay for warlocks is cool too
I love the warlock snap it’s like Roy mustang 😩😩
Yooo the warlocks are like Roy Mustang in Full Metal Alchemist 🤯
Damn, shame yall didn't bring the warlocks resurrection super back
these guys are fun
Godkingdukebootyquake rises once more
Icarus dash and phoenix dive can be used together fuck recovery stats 😂😂😂😂😂
Really digging the Roy mustang Warlock
I pray they don't get rid of the abilites from top tree arcstrider when Arc 3.0 comes out, one of my favourite melee builds.
HOLY CRAP THIS IS AWESOOOME!
Meanwhile invis and bastion were balanced to hell and back
WARLOCKS ARE LITERALLY ROY MUSTANG OH MY GOD
Jesusfuck. My dick can only get so hard👏👍
General mustang…. Sick
absolutely Love everything, but as an arcstrider main, I'm a bit salty they're pretending that titan melee ability is so revolutionary and not just a reskinned Tempest strike except it one-shots in PVP and is 3x better than tempest strike. Don't get me wrong, the new melee looks sick as fuck and I'm super hype for it, but man arcstriders have gotten the short end of the stick for a long time now and I really want arc 3.0 to help it
I started playing Destiny during year 1 of D2 (as a hunter) and the class I had clicked the most with had been gunslinger. Getting to see what I can now do with my fav subclass has made me cheer out loud watching this! You guys have absolutely outdone yourselves with subclass 3.0 :)
2:29 This makes me want Bob to do something
Warlocks out here like Roy Mustang
Can't wait to play as Ray mustang
rip sun warrior? sunspots no longer give damage buff and increased resistance :(
I can be ROY MUSTANG...that's all I need...
Man why have I been waisting my time on halo infinite!!! Destiny 2 is so great!!!
proud to be a titan main
the armor is so sexy
Dope
The worlacks are sus with new snaps! xD
This is such a bungie vidoc type of video
I see savathun keeps here theme in every trailer. nice to see the consistency
i stopped enjoying when they removed one of the passives from geomags cause a small substrata of the community didnt like it
Really love these type of videos. Wish they would start doing more of these . Even about small balancing updates . Like to see their reason/thought process.
This if fk discrimination the warlock finger flip way on different levels than the other 2 classes I stg they disimcirnminate the warlocks
I hope they gave blade barrage some love, it’s been in a bad spot for awhile
cammy blew his load when he saw the new tripmine
I need some insight on who developed the garbage trials armor
titan hammer slam has to be the coolest thing the titans have gotten to date.
smh. y’all did the hunters dirty. Titan and warlock get this cool shit and you give the Hunter a projectile
As a dedicated warlock main and healer I am very much looking forward to this
Can’t wait to return to my chain weighted knife build and being able to use the  pvp golden gun. Solar  rework gonna make me act up.
It’s good to see trespasser back!!
This season will be hella fun, the game has been coming more and more community based and I'm sure everyone loves it. Waiting for the season feels like waiting to wake up to presents on the night of christmas eve.
Incinerator Snap reminds me of Bioshock's incinerate ability 🤘🏼
I'm so happy that these are the guys making our subclasess
Actually looks pretty cool, I look forward to arc 3.0
My inner Roy Mustang can now be filled thank you Bungie, I'll never be leaving my warlock.
Guess what class people are going to be using after the weekly refresh... The big guy on the right of the video (the left one) seems passionate about what he does.
You know a cool idea I guess I mean I know there already solar weapons and other element type weapons but what if you could like get an exotic weapon or…or a regular gun and like do an animation where you like rub your hand across the gun with your solar power activated and it makes that ammo in the gun have a reaction to it and when you shoot the next mag into enemies the gun will have a constant or lingering burn damage Stronger elemental burn like an auto rifle or hand cannon you know that would be neat
Solar 3.0 is so powerful, I clicked this video and 15 seconds in my PC overheated and shut down.
The snap grenade reminds me of bioshock! Can't wait
Game is dead. PvP designed for Whales. Story content designed for Whales. You'd be better off swapping IP's w/ 343 if you hadn't signed with Sony.
I might stick with void hunter I’m not really impressed with solar hunter But I’ll give it a shot to see if it’s valid
I believe I speak for all Titans... when I say that double hammer slam is absolutely beautifully perfect.
Can I fially perfect the healer build!??
wait so you can throw hammer AND do the hammerslam? thats sick
PLEASE DONT TELL ME THEY DELETED TRIPLE KNIVES
YES!!!
Bungie: Were excited for the release of Solar 3.0 Bungie 1 week later: Celestial Nighthawk Damage will be nerfed
self res when?
PHOENIX DIVE LIVES!! I was so worried they were going to remove it.
guys did you see the antiope??? ARE THEY BRINGING BACK MY BABY THE ANTIOPE?!?!?!?!
Fuck yea! this is the one thing they could have done to bring me back in
That warlock snap, regardless of how good it is has to be the coolest introduction. So satisfying to watch
I want hunter backflips and I want them now
If we can overcharge our grenades to make the Solar ones bigger, it makes nuking the battle Field with suns so much more insane
I'm down for this. :)
So... Ppl that cry about balancing classes and games are technically fun suckers right ???
phoenix dive instead of rift count me in
Devs: “Now you can shoot your tripmine”  So can cammycakes but he has been doing that since the release of the game.
Warlocks: we want efficiency! Hunters: we want style and balance! Titans: WE WANT FIRE!
Seeing that Hunters basically duct tape our explosives together really feels like a "Random bullshit, go!" moment and I love it
So the end screen shows the crown of sorrow, the moon, Caiatal, Crow and Zavala at the tower, one of the "Moon/Pyramid/Shadowkeep" phantoms is Ghaul, can anyone suggest what the other 2 are?
I’d buy Kevin Yanes a beer
Solar 3.0 will be awesome
Not a single Thanos snap joke in the comments, eh?
I’m already calling that the hunter subclass will get nerfed cause I guess those abilities it has is op.
another titan-animation-lock super? -great...
Roy Mustang would be proud of the Warlocks
Hunter literally rips off Overwatch lmao
it's gonna be so cool
Wait a minute did they get rid of rift for warlocks? That icon is Phoenix Dive?
Solar 3.0 Titan: DOUBLE HAMMER UPPER CUT SLAM!  Void 3.0 Titan: I can throw a shield.
Could listen to these guys talk all day 😂
DEAR BUNGIE, Please let us change our male characters into women characters and vice versa. It's 2022 Bungie it's time to be gender inclusive
INCOMING THANOS WARLOCK BOISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Gjallarharn 3.0 developer insight
Holy jesus
I absolutely adore that the Warlock Melee is just the Incinerate Plasmid from Bioshock lmao But Titan and Hunter also lookin' spicy af as well o3o
This was very much worth the wait
Nerfs incoming
Curious to see what that Warlock dive ability is about, finally we'll have one too lmao xD
Dudley!  So happy to see you in this! Glad they showcased more VFX artists! CONGRATS this looks great!
I can already see E1itedeath complaining about every single Solar ability 😂
Man... I thought this video was gonna be like 15-20 mins long.   Boooooo
Warlocks getting the incinerate snap from Bioshock?!?!!. I might main warlock and hunter this season for sure!!
Mustang snap lol
Icarus Dash AND Phoenix Dive together at the same time? Nut
They really went Roy Mustang with the Warlocks huh
All warlocks are about to cosplay Roy Mustang and I love it.
sheesh
Feel like this is this beginning of a new era for Destiny! So pumped!
Warlock: *Snaps fingers* Thanos: "Perfectly balanced as all things should be"
This really gonna be season of the napalm
Hunters be like "I'm am going to throw what is essentially a C4 charge at a group of targets and shoot it." I can't wait to see what they do for Arc Hunters.
3:33 sooo antiope is back ?
O the titan new melee is a slide melee aspect or something
They turned warlocks into Roy mustang
"We are.... INEVITABLE." - Solar 3.0 Warlocks  *snaps fingers*
Warlocks just became Roy Mustang
I am SOOOOO excited to brun them to crispsssss
Titans And Warlocks: Did you just really ductaped three grenades to make a new one for your class?  Hunters: Hey! As long as it works
Colonel Mustang build ideas already in progress
Pops pew pew revolver gun and Knifey Knife thingy at the same time like cayde?
This video has more likes than views. LETS GOO!!
Umm... Did they rip the idea of gunpowder gamble off from CammyCakes?!😱😳
I'd still rather have a new class
TRANSFORMATIVE!!!!!!!
The warlock armor is screaming Nazgûl esthetic
Sucks that sun warrior lost its damage buff, BUT THE HAMMER UPPERCUT SLAM MAKES UP FOR IT!!
Archangle pyromancer combo.. Lets go Bungie!!!!! Warlocks ftw
Roy Mustang at the travelers service!
At 0:35 it shows hunters have 4 melees, 3 supers, and 3 dodges. The selected dodge looks new, like a healing or support dodge, so hyped!
That new armor is absolutely sick, but Bungie if you see this please, please, please, learn from the Destiny 1 armor Design's. The old Trials armor was absolutely fantastic and in my opinion, looked heavily inspired by the old Crucible armor from D1 you got with Crucible Tokens. I main warlock so finding gear for my guardian that actually looks good is almost impossible. All robes are either too long, too tattered, or just plain out ugly. In Destiny 1 though we were able to make our guardians look way better than D2 guardians, without ornaments, without customizable shaders, without exotic gear being able to be shaded, with all these new character customizations you guys have released why is it I feel I cant customize my guardian sufficiently. I will say these new abilities though are siiiiiiick, all of them 10/10 match their class, warlocks maybe not as much but if a warlock had to be cool as hell and wear sunglasses, they'd probably snap their fingers to kill enemies.
Really Making  warlocks and the other classes feel like warlocks and what not can't wait to play.
As a titan main I just have one thing to say... TIME TO BRING THE HAMMER DOWN!!!
Plz don’t nerf these subclass like you guys did with void 3.0.
OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOD DAMN COOL!
No self rez😞😞
and we still don't have incendiary bullets :(
My poor crucible liking heart is bleeding already
Just keep doing what you're doing bungie I love you guys so much!! This looks amazing
3 more months of crappy Arc sub classes. Sigh.
When bungee ads colonel Mustang from Fullmetal into D2 🫰🔥
Sad weapon damage gone from the sunspot  Wish they just removed lorely and give old sunspot back
Bungie are you trying to make me a titan main? So far the Void 3.0 changes were amazing, but the titan looks the most fun atm!
Bruh they really gave Warlocks Mustang’s fire snap from Full Metal Alchemist lol
Completed Elden Ring 5 times. Erdtrees are still burning. Time to jump back in Destiny and burn aliens instead ! I'm in !
So Solar 3.0 make the 3 classes the equivalent of 3 memes. Warlocks= The autistic kid from South Park that wants to burn the school down, burn it to thr gwound... but with Roy Mustang's snap. Hunters= Its time for JOLLY COOPERATION!  Titans= Ex3p1o5i0Ns?  Or.. YOU WANT ME TO BRING THE HAMMER DOWN!? but with fire...
Bro that warlocking snapping his finger got to be the cheesiest and the best way to shit on another guardian ✋
Every class can use healing nades, very nice
the hunter grenade feels so much like ashe's bomb from overwatch and its such a blast to use so im hyped for that
Yay, Hunters still get shafted as always :D Good to see Bungie stays consistent 👍
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oh cool now I can turn my warlock into Roy Mustang.
We get fucking plasmids
3:34 did i just see an Icarus dash and a Phoenix dive that can be used together. Aerial dodge and then insta heal?
The titan slam is nice
Full metal alchemists fans are loving this. The Roy Mustang snap is amazing.
please have playing with fire
i'm Roy Mustang now. Fuck yeah!
This...is.... AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
As a warlock main I feel kind let down we already lack in damage and now they focus the healing I'll have to wait and see but so far warlocks have nothing on titans and hunters both those classes look really cool and warlocks are basically a failed version of Thanos
Warlock: Snaps  Thanos: that’s my thing you can’t do this to me!
It melts your face off, just like an unborn child who’s being aborted.
In gonna boutta go Roy Mustang with my Solar Warlock. SNAP SNAP!
So excited to try out solar3.0 on my hunter!
Love it how you can effectively play as Ashe from overwatch as a hunter with the new grenade and DMT
Ah yes, the Warlock Sorcerer fantasy "Doors are for people with no imagination" *click, BOOM*
3:03 finally Roy Mustang in the game
Sunbracers: ~hehe boiii!!!
My Warlock to all enemies: You should have gone for the head. *snaps
3:35 Warlocks can now Icarus Dash AND Phoenix Dive? Awesome!
Did anybody else think of Roy Mustang when they introduced the Warlocks incinerator snap?
Ah I love being a warlock
lmfao I give it 15 mins after season drop before titan new ability gets nerfed
Baby killers
I've been thinking about which class to play first for solar this season and after I saw incinerator snap my mind was made up ROY MUSTANG ALL THE WAY
Aw yeah, Roy Mustang style pyromancy
now I want to re-watch Full Metal Alchemists
Cant remember ever being this hyped for a season… heck to the eff yeah!
Holy shit, this looks so cool
All those void 3.0 is still going to be better are going to eat there words
Roy mustang in destiny
Titans really need more love currently. Seems the Warlocks are becoming more op by the day. Surely this needs balancing hopefully comes with arc 3.0 or the titan class becomes unviable
YEEEE
Infinity gauntlet for warlocks please
Finally, solar will be the quick snappy extravagant su class it was always meant to be
Incinerate Snap is my fantasy of becoming a flame alchemist… and I’ll now be playing Warlock as a secondary
Fantastic job Bungo excited for arc 3.0 , would rather it all comes at once so the other subclasses don't suffer but ill take what I can get
Nice to see real developers and not pandering blue hair.
time to burn EVERYTHING
3:33 BRUH HEAT RISES+ICARUS DASH+ PHOENIX DIVE WHEN NOT USING MY SUPER?!! IM NEVER SWITCHING OF SOLAR 3.0! WARLOCK MASTER RACE!
As a Bioshock fan seeing Warlocks use Incinerate is a marriage made in heaven… it’s a damn shame that I main Hunter.
Titan will be the best pve solar subclass overall, the damage of abilities from roaring flames along with the ability regeneration and restoration of sunsots and the weakness applying aspect of the hammer strike melee ability. Im in love.
loooove this solar rework and the gear styles O.o i can't wait!
Get ready for charging Titans again in Crucible
Cammy really inspired the tripmine shot lol
So Warlocks can become Thanos now? Cool
Warlock. Claws of ahamkara and Monte Carlo...it's gonna be a fun season
My boy cayde would’ve been alive if he had solar 3.0… damn it bungie 😢
Titans: Fire Thor  Warlocks-Fire Thanos!
Destiny 2 : Season of Thanos Snap
is icarus dash still a thing?
Titans: FLAME HAMMERS GO BONK! Hunters: Here, lemme rig a nuke together. *Tapes 3 mines together and yeets* Warlocks: *sigh* Animals. Where's the ✨style?✨ *Channels inner Roy Mustang*
If this is what solar got I can’t wait for arc 3.0. Maybe arc hunters will actually be viable in GMs
Wormgod caress nerf incoming
I got to say having the titan screen be just a fist every time is kinda disappointing, hunters and warlocks are always holding something unique meanwhile titans just have nothing. Like let us hold the shield or hammer instead
Operation Caliente. So simple, yet so brilliant lmao
Anyone else noticed the additional items in the Hunter and warlock class ability slots. I think the new empowering leap is a new dodge and Icarus dash and or Phoenix Dive are replacing the rift in the slot
I always wanted to be the Flame Alchemist.
This 3.0 update and season is going to be so fire!🔥
wow
Warlock snapping with finger.. i get full metal alchemist vibe of it 😁
HYPE!!!
so many reprised weapons and areas again, so original and new!  would be cool if you all could hire devs that actually want to make new original content instead of always just copy pasting old content. do better because this half assed shit aint it
Solar 3.0 looks amazing. As someone who loved Hunter’s Way of the Pathfinder as it used to be with Lockdown/Combat Provision and Heart of the Pack, I had some fun with the new Nightstalker but I really missed the old one. I was scared Gunslinger was going to have the same thing happen to it, losing some of their identity with their buffs in favour of focusing on some debuffing niche or just all fire in some way. But from what I’ve seen new Gunslinger looks like they haven’t lost nearly as much as Nightstalker did and I’m really happy about that. Now I just hope weighted knife is the same as it was or better. Easily my favourite part of Way of the Sharpshooter
Anyone notice how warlocks have an extra class ability
I literally cannot wait for arc.
Pile of shit dead game
"Titan, they are the best at big damage" * *laughs in top damage most raid fights with my Warlock* *
Warlocks being able to both Icarus dash and Phoenix Dive is what I'm really waiting for!!
I am calling gunpowder gamble the "dick bomb" and there is nothing you can do to stop me.
I'm hoping the Titan solar slam thing has to be double triggered so it can make it harder to predict when you'll do it.
God damn they really did it they did the Roy Mustang thing.
For titan that sounds like an easy method to eating a sniper bullet on the face. I'd rather not be automatically lifted up into the air and be forced to roll the dice whether I don't get snapshotted for my troubles. I've already got enough problems with corner campers
Guardians looking like a bunch of daedra when they showed them popping their supes in slow mo lol
Icarus dash and phoenix fall one after the other?! Yoooo
Monte Carlo and either karnsteins wi gets it claws of ahamkara full melee build incoming for e I wanna go around finger gunning people to death lol
Warlock's solar finger snap remind me of Bioshock fire plasmid, love it !
That warlock Icarus Dashed into a Phoenix Dive?
Hunter has 3 dodge options?
I'm going to say right now I was wrong about it being Arc! It's Solar! And I'm very excited!! All I can say is I'm going to be snapping my damn fingers all the time!
ROOOOOY FUCKING MUSTANG!
im so fucking happy 🫶
As excited as I am for Solar 3.0, I think arc should have came first with how far behind it is in terms of overall balancing. Void is fantastic, Solar was very rounded but then arc was kinda just a niche pick for hunters and the other two had their upsides and downsides. Nevertheless, I am very excited to see what they do with both solar and arc 3.0 in the future!
Player base: "balance" yea sure hold my beer and gimme 5 mins I'll show you real balance
I'm not digging the Warlock ability. It seems kind alame at the moment.
I am 100% sure that Warlock finger snap is a Bioshock reference (it's even called Incinerator Snap!) and that makes me very happy
Man, if this is the level of insane new abilities we're getting with Solar, i can't wait to see what they made for Arc
Anal insight. Delve into the Colon
Isn't there a comic drawing of a Warlock doing the incinerator snap on a thrall? That's dope!
How long until someone makes a Roy Mustang looking warlock
if i see titans using icarus dash i tilt....
With my warlock build already being very heavily melee focused, I am going to Roy Mustang tf out of everything.
Alright they gave Hunter the same bomb as Ashe has in Overwatch. Nice
I never would have seen the day where both top tree Dawnblade and the dive from bottom tree would be mixed into one. That is kinda nutty, and also at the same time going to flow so we'll it about to be ridiculous.
I've watched this 20 times now
Warlocks: Ah, it looks like it's beginning to rain.  *SNAP*
This update looks pretty fire, hope I don’t get too burned in the crucible over it tho
As a top tree and middle tree warlock solar main I'm so excited for this, I'm going to be able to Icarus dash AND heal. Also I am totally making a melee build for that finger snap
I can live out my Roy Mustang fantasies as a warlock now🔥❤️
New crucible map?!
i feel so bad for the people that still play this game
Bringing out the warmind cells once again lol it's going to be nuts
"An ability where one thing needs to die"     Shoulder charge: *Insert sad cat with thumbs up image*
Get ready for the nerfs
Finally I can live out my FMA dreams of snapping my enemies to death
Wow
Cayde would be so proud of us taping 3 grenades together to shoot out of the sky.
Warlock finger snap is like killer queen
Warlocks are roy mustang now
The spicy subclass 🔥
Solar titan looks like it literally got the changes I've always wanted go see. More fire and more badassery. And the warlock snap is fresh as fuck
Once again the hunters get screwed...
DOOM SLAYER TIME
Really hoping that snap thing isnt the only warlock melee or I'm going to be pretty miffed
I wish we get a new solar gunter ult
roy mustang cosplay let's GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The Order of Sunbreakers shall rise again
NEW CRUCIBLE MAP????
Time to make Shin and Cayde proud boys
FINALLY my Hallowfire Heart will rise!!!
Bungie making the healing grenade an actual grenade (inferred from shown warlock aspect is smart) I didn’t know how they would fit everything in Interested about the grenade warlock aspect though, seems kind of meh but I like grenade builds, here’s to hoping it’s good
Yay more garbage 10 dollar seasons that gives dick for content and the fan base swoons over. No one gives a fuck about narrative. Stop pushing narrative in an mmorpg. Give good loot grinds, better stats, actual interesting weapons. This is a god damn futuristic shooter rpg. Nothing exciting about a spear and bows. Drop actual NEW content. I never bash destiny for recycled content. But EVERYTHING they have shown for this “content” is fucking recycled and rehashed. I mean for fuck sake even the “new weapons” are just nameless midnight, retraced path, tomorrows answer, and (insert any shitty glaive no one cares about here.) And you morons are losing your mind about this? No wonder destiny has gone down the shitter.  And don’t even get me started on the menagerie weapons, those are literally recycled recycled fucking weapons for weapons we already have back in the FUCKING GAME. Austringer and beloved were LITERALLY rehashed Eyasluna and Thousand yard stare. But guess what THEY ALREADY FUCKING RECYCLED THOSE BACK IN. God destiny playerbase get your fucking heads out of your asses and do better! If we just stopped buying these absolute jokes of seasons and demanded better content destiny might become a better place. Make season more expensive again, we should have DLC again as opposed to seasons. The seasonal model has been a complete FLOP since shadowkeep. Forsaken DLCS in black armor jokers wild and penumbra were the LAST great dlc content we received, why? Because it actually costed something. If you can’t afford 20/25 dollar dlc, you shouldn’t be gaming. I’m sorry you’re poor, get a better job. Games shouldn’t have to suffer quality because of broke ass people.
WOOOOOOOOOO Y E S A R S O N G A N G
WOOOOOOO
My guy just said, “it has to be balanced totally.” Like bruh, what are you talking about? Solar 3.0 is going to be as broken as avoid 3.0! Don’t use words you do not know the meaning of.
DMT users when the combined trip mine can be shot mid-air: *It's show time.*
all those people who could already point click their trip mine are going to have a field day.
I love how flashy the solar animations are they look so cool!!
holy shit fellas is the warlock a roy mustang reference?
That snap grenade is going to be full on nasty
Who knew Roy mustang would be a warlock
YYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! - Lord Shaxx said, calmly
i haven't touched anything other than void foir like the past 6 months, now is the time.
So hyped to use solar , void has ruined my destiny 2 experience this season
drinking game: take a shot for every method of healing warlocks will get this season i already counted 3, and THEY ALL HEAL EVERYONE IN THEIR GENERAL VICINITY WHO ISN'T AN ENEMY
Hunter underwhelming as usual.
Season of the burn 🔥
Hell yes.  Always disliked hunter solar grenades, this is just what it needed.  Everything good here.
Titans could of had chains . But I'm happy with the changes lol
I feel like that Titan combo won’t see much use in PvP.  It looks like you’ll be up in the air long enough for a shotgun blast or a fusion rifle burst, maybe a sniper shot if you do it in the open.
Titans:"bungie loves hunters theyre their lovechild" Bungie:talks about titan changes eith the only new changes for 70% of the update video, hunter grenade loses power and is treated as new
Just look at solar 3.0 🥵
Roy Mustang wants his move back Gaurdians!
I love the fact that they’re really driving us into this, pick your element power fantasy where people who really really embrace a play style and theme can feel good about logging on, solar and stasis is always my favorite elements so this season is gonna be amazing
I was hoping so bad the scythe was a new hunter super, but then I saw a warlock holding it too. I was bummed lol but still excited to see what all is coming
just a bit sad that it's solar and not arc, but TIME TO BURN THE HIVE BABY
Don't worry they definitely going to nerf these abilities soon after!
From the looks of it the new Hunter dodge isn't a aspect, if you look at the dodge symbol at 0:35 it's different
Bro really tried to hype up hunters.. And then made Titans and Warlocks the best in both criteria😂
Showing us all those new abilities and aspects, is really cool, but personally I wanna see what they did to some of the old ones and which “unlucky” ones they are gonna remove.   But other than that titan hammer slam go brrr
That incinerator snap is going to be dubbed the thanos snap.
Ship it OP to generate sales. Nerf it later to better align with the rest of the sandbox. It's textbook at this point.
Let's go! I'm so hyped!
ah yes warlock we just snap you out of existence lol
A simple uppercut/slam combo just blew big boy's little mind... lol okay
Destiny: "Here's a 3 month season with a new dungeon, armour, weapons, skill tree rework, Leviathan returns as a destination, new 6-player activity, new IB rework, new raid rotator, new dungeon rotator, seasonal event returns, new *PVP* map, new story content".  Halo infinite: "Here's a 6 month season, with 2 "PVP" maps, some small balance patches and a cutscenes....... Oh balls, we broke the BR for a week....".  It's just funny because 343 stated that the Tiger (Halo/Destiny 1) engine was too hard to work on, so they made the Slipspace engine, but their output is even worse than releasing 2-3 map packs a year (Halo 3, Reach, 4 and 5).
Isn’t the double jammed slam thing literally the same effect as the flame wave grenade?
I am never going to take this Titan helmet off, and this looks amazing! Can't wait to play with it in a few hours
Still wish arc was next but this is still badass 🙏
Solar snap wow.
AMAZING JOB BUNGIE TEAAAM!!! ♥
Warlock: Roy Mustang Hunter: Ashe (Overwatch) Titan: Fiery Abomination
they better have more pve i hate pvp
They totally got that tripmine idea from CammyCakes.
Being able to shoot your tripmine is very cool, but now with the frame rate will be much cooler
No self res :(
I love the direction Bungie took with 3.0 subclasses.   Instead of just giving more customization, they’re developing entirely new abilities and status effects, as well as making every ability of your subclass synergize and feel hella fun to use.
Young ahamakara spine is looking prime to make a major comeback!
The warlocks have become Colonel Roy Mustang and I love it
0:22  The fact they didn't shoot this guy beforehand makes me recoil in horror at how the bungie team showcases pvp.  Its The Fortress, the cave they're in has a pretty massive line of sight in the direction the hunter was going in.  And if the hunter waited that long and pushed that hard to use his super, why didn't they just gun him down!?
This is about to be a banger season
Hunters making others radiant, am i hearing that gunslinger will give weapon damage buff when they pop goldy?
so basically the warlock is roy mustang from fma
Solar 3.0 So basically its void 3.0 with orange colors
"throw your grenade and immediately whip out your handcannon and trickshot it out of the air" With the Last Word, this is gonna be the new Deafult of Space Cowboy power fantasy.
i really hope that they manage to reinvent solar while simultaneously retaining the things people love about it right now.
BRO WARLOCK MELEE LOOKS SICK GOOD SHIT BUNGO
cant wait to see what they nerf for hunters this season
This update going to be 🔥
Wonder if icarus dash will still be in the game haven't seen it but I'm probably just blind
My god…. Holy f***- this is gonna awsome
All on board for the trip mine you can shoot out of the air. :)
When we going to get a Cabal Titan??? 💪🥳🏋️‍♂️🤜 I liked this last season whole Cabal Vanguard team up. Wasnt impressed by the fallen/eliksni cry me a river campaign. But, I will jump on board for a Cabal team up, I mean Gaul had it (stolen, yes) But... I can see Cabal harnessing it to help us battle the taken + hive + darkness.  Plus Empress Caiatl, seems like the only Cabal with brains, strength and reason. She kind of reminds me of a female Zavala.
Alright that titan melee looks pretty cool
El juego es una MIERDA parecen cachurecos
Incinerator snap...Bioshock and FMA inspiration?
I AM SO EXCITED TO ARC 3.0 NOW
Can't wait to be roy mustang from FMAB while playing warlock
Does Bungie hate hunters or what now . Titan - slam hammer in the ground Warlock - Thanos snap lmao  all done . Oh wait no hunters ofc ofc u guys get a  " Duct taped nade " (:
Well, D2 servers are already experiencing connection issues, that's how you know a new season is starting! 🎶 "Hello WEASEL my old friend..." 🎶
That titan slam tho......
holy shit, burn! 😎
There at the end was that an Icarus dash into Phoenix Dive? Or an Icarus dash into wellspring Ult? Cause if you can use Icarus and phoenix dive together that seems preeeeeeetty strong.
I wonder if that packed tripmine works with ahamkara spine? Might be busted of it does
Titan: a powerful behemoth that can dual wield hammers of sol, and crash and rain down fire from above.  Warlock: an elegant yet deadly combo of fury and support that can burn the entire field with a flame   Hunter: ductape grenades
My body is not ready.
So...are we going to get a Mustang vs. Envy style finisher for Warlock?
The Warlock: “Foolish mortals, You’ve should have gone for the head”  *finger snap*
I think i was 55% Warlock 30% Titan nowadays but i'm Tempted to go back. I really enjoy Stasis Titan as you need that little bit more skill to get the most from it but Void Titan was strong but dull to play. I'm hopeful that Solar 3.0 Titan will be that perfect blend. Requiring skill but less moments when i'm playing Behemoth where i'm screwed because i whiffed an ability.
mustang from fullmetal alchemist : hey you copied my move    Some random warlock: no you copied my move   😂
Cant wait to attach 4 stat boost aspects and never change.
Warlocks out here on their Mustang cosplay with that fire snap
time to be the Grim Reaper
yoooo add gyro aim, there are no excuses now
All about the titan baby yeehaaa!
Warlocks just became Roy Mustang
Is it already out?
Took you three years for this. How about add different supers. Bungie's staff imagination is pretty lackluster.
who gave warlocks the infinity stones
Idc how shit Incerinator snap will be i will use it
They are literally buffing warlocks all the time
Haven’t watched it yet but if this is not filled with puns about fire flames and burning I’m gonna be mad
So Hunters got a "change" that allows them to do a thing they already could do? Seems kinda anticlimactic in my opinion
acting like the titan hammer uppercut is some never before done move, OH WAIT HUNTERS HAVE HAD IT AS AN ARC ABILITY FOR YEARS
Im so happy man
The warlock healer builds are going to be insane now. Really curious on celestial nighthawk builds now.
Antiope is back? Hell yeah!
Gorgeous animations for abilities!
Warlocks, now with 80% more alchemy
I might give Solar a go now. That finger click for Warlock just looks great!
Cammy is creaming at that new hunter made
titan the scorch earth tactic
Don't think I didn't see that icarus dash into a phoenix dive!
I am going to have a blast with incinerator snap.
Praise the Sun
Warlock melee: “Once more! With style!”
so the warlock and the titan gets some shinny amazing combo stuff and the hunter gets some nades tapped around?....
Phoenix dash AND dive?! Sign me up!
I still wish Bungie would use non-staff testers for new content. Developers are bias and focus more on design than overall gameplay. Solar 3.0 looks great, but I’m definitely expecting glitches, “Pardon our Dust” maintenance, and a few more nerfs or buffs before the season ends.  This is what you get when a studio stops testing content properly before they release it. We the players are the testers who don’t get paid for our frustrations.
This is more like opening up your Christmas present and seeing a pair of socks, this is disappointing, Arc subclasses are so weak outside of Curiass Thundercrash and Geomag Chaos Reach
Man Warlocks really became Roy Mustang…
This is legit the best season ever for destiny I think. It brings back the best location, adds a whole lot of new flashy moves, and c’mon   We all want to use that scythe
I wasn't expecting a snap to be a melee. All for it
Warlock: The Fire Alchemist. Mustang would be proud
I'm still waiting for self rez, while activating a well or radiance
Better than anything I could come up with in the many-month period between Light 3.0’s announcement and now. Props to the team, seriously! Verbing up Solar is not easy.
3:02 there is no way that this is not supposed to be Roy Mustang
I swear to god if that ducktaped tripmine works with young ahamkara’s spine Im gonna lose my mind!
Your drop protection is still ass. Got so frustrated trying to get to max level last night.
Like everyone else, the snap. That is some of the most satisfying looking shit ever
reset cant come any faster
Celestial fire? Where are you? :(
As a solar titan main I'm so stoked
So basically, they made Hunter even more dominant in PvP with a grenade you can shoot and that deals a DoT. Don't complain people still dont go into pvp Bungie.
This is fireeeeeeee
“Cuz that balance could never come at the expense of fun”….sure…
Once again, our waiting has been well rewarded. Can’t wait for everyone to be solar for the next 3 months.
Imma be honest, I was a bit worried about the "throw the grenade and shoot it" mechanic because of how chaotic the game can be. But after seeing what I assume is the hitbox for it, mmm I am down for it
So warlocks are Roy Mustang from FMA
damn by the time we get to season 19 Stasis is gonna look really lame in comparison. Hopefully it gets its own rework before the new element drops, perhaps a proper implimentation of the Stasis resist mechanic, where instead of certain things granting overshields, they can grant stacks of resist.   They should make it appear like a coating of ice covering your guardian so it both fits thematically and is easy to spot in crucible.
I can’t wait to become Roy Mustang in D2
Solar 3.0 is gonna be...*looks at camera*...lit. 😏
Solar snap is so Anime. Getting Full Metal Alchemist feels
SHEEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH at least it isnt arc
Incinerator snap just lets you be captain mustang. Bout to burn some homunculi
I'm so hyped this looks amazing just one and half more hours to go.
Blowing the tripmine mid air with a sniper shot to get a multikill... you already know Cammycakes is gonna have a field day in crucible for the next few weeks
From a lore perspective, I personally find it interesting that the Solar Aspects appear to be in the form of physical objects, similar to the the Stasis Aspects, whereas the Void Aspects were more intangible in nature.
is that antiope-d at 3:00 ?
They've removed my power fantasy of spamming both spamming solar and healing grenades with the Sunbracers. The build I've been using for years. It's OK. I'm fine. *flips desk*
Using warlock with sunbrace image crashing the game 🤣
I'm screaming 😱  yesssssssssss
Cade was weak. He deserted his fellow Gaurdians.
not sure what i'm enjoying more: the Roy Mustang snap, or watching others appreciate the Roy Mustang snap as well
Please tell me the incinerator snap was inspired by Roy Mustang from Full Metal Alchemist.
As a solar titan main, I COULD NOT BE MORE HYPED ON THIS SEASON!!!!!!
The titan slam looks SICK
Are there new adjectives like for void 3.0?
would be nice if the snap was also on hunters but still awesome for titans warlocks and hunter      WOOO IM BOUT TO GRILL SOME ENEMIES
That scene where they were playing together seemed so natural and genuine. Just kidding.
Mayhem is gonna be well.... absolute Mayhem
What the hell did they do to Weighted Knife??
Warlock: You should’ve gone for the head. *snap*
Sat here waiting for the update letssssss gooooo babbyyyyy
Where is my radiance????
Oh shit
Holy crap
roy mustang this, roy mustang that. i'm surprised nobody has referenced giorno's snap in part 5 of jojos yet lol
cant wait to not be able to log in today
2:30 They really made the Cammycakes-Granade in an Ability XD
Titans get CONSECRATION!! Even closer to my Paladin fantasy, LOVE IT!
Welp time to start using Solar again and dust off Eriana's Vow to make the best explosive combination.
PRAISE THE SUN \[T]/
So... Warlocks now have the style of Roy Mustang? 😈
Now I'm gonna make a pure melee build
Void they sold abilities Solar you find some lame ass items as aspects. Theres no consistency
Whooooo
Roy Mustang approves of the finger snap.
pog
I hope that titan slam is broken asf we need something to bully them fucking hunters for a week or 2 till it’s nerfed
Dawnblade out here leaning into the "I can be your angle...or yuor devil." meme.
Literal chills. I'm so stoked for the explosive carnage & mayhem that my friends & I will get into. The only hunter main usually so I'm glad to see some love inspiration that only I can do
They borrowed Ashe's dynamite bundle from Overwatch but made it sticky lol.
SOLAR 3.0 is totally CRACKED…& IT CANNOT HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH 4 ME! 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
As a warlock I never thought I’d turn into thanos 😂
Hunter getting neft next week sou dont get to hype
Wait did the warlock just snap like Roy Mustang from Full metal alchemist??? 🤔😁🥳
Is this going to be free? Im still not going to pay for witch queen. Just not worth it.
Titan: "Hunter, you ready to go yet?"  Hunter: "Hang on... uh, one of you guys got some duct tape?"  Warlock: "Why?"  Hunter: "Heeheeheehee... you'll see."
YUH
0:34 does that hunter have 3 different dodges?!
For this first time I can't decide which one I wish to play with first at release.
I can't wait till arc 3.0 these changes to all the subclasses feels like a new game
Sweet the young ahamakaras spine I just got is gonna be busted with that new trip mine augment
Warlocks can literally be thanos!!!
Antiope ?
0:0:36 am I seeing a 10 minute base cooldown on sol invictus? That makes me so sad :c  Everything else seems pretty awesome though
So ready for another overpriced and underwhelming DLC
Ultrakill has made me spoiled lmao, I'd love to see the Hunter Grenade have different radiuses depending on which weapon you shoot it with. Like at the bottom of the spectrum is an Auto Rifle or Sidearm bullet and at the complete other end are like Izanagis or LFR shots
Looks like Phoenix Dive is a Warlock Class ability. And that Mustang Snap looks LIT 🔥 CAN’T WAIT
A fire ball came out of my pants after seeing this
Now, will nighthawk be the best damage on bosses?
The snap looks strong after detonation
Is it me or they are sweating in the play test cause it looks like their forehead is wet shiny 1:30 ,but it might just be the lights as well.
Can't wait to be the Healer Warlock I've always wanted to be!
Uuuh the solar melee on lock is gonna be so annoying, as usual lol
That warlock thanos snap just makes me giggle man I’m so hyped
Me: Look at these awesome changes! I can't wait to use--  My raid team: Get on well. That's your job. It's always been your job.  Me: I- But- Fine.....  Raid Team: Put Div on too.   Me: *internally screaming*
OMG ITS SOLAR 3.0!!!
Solar has been my favorite for all 3 classes for a long time, this is gonna be so cool
I saw the 10:25 cooldown on Sol Invictus, does this mean 10m cooldown on sunspots? :(
The warlocks got a whole FULL METAL ALCHEMIST REFERENCE FOR THEIR MELEE
Did I just see a warlock Icarus dash and Icarus dive back to back, movement is about to be insane.
"And with the snap of my finger, I can make entire people disappear".
The titan has 7 grenades
I want that testing range
I can already see my Warlock styling on his enemies by killing them with a snap of his fingers, like a true god-killer is supposed to
It's time to rock my favorite subclass but upgraded to 3.0. Let's rock ladies and gentlemen.
I like how Both warlock and Titan showcases have that fantasy esque element to it, then there are hunters. . . .3 ductaped tripmine grenades.
Pheonix dive and Icarus DAsh at the same time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The warlock snap looks sooo crispy. Can't wait to try this out with dawn chorus
did the dev ate all the food in their studios?
YES!!!
That Warlock snap melee is so sick. it's literally Roy Mustangs fire snap.
so your telling me a warlock can pheonix dive and get what looks to be fully healed and an overshield? thats gonna be hell to fight.
THAT ROY MUSTANG SNAP THOUGH
the new fire animations are spicy
Me who made a trip mine build earlier today everything will fucking die
I feel like they half assed hunters, "bestt at weapon damage " that means we get very little cool abilities, solar dive + big bomb. Those feel bad to hear no cool abilities and no cool concepts. Blade barrage was shit but fun this feels totally sweaty and little actual fun. Sorry needed to rant
Yay so excited as a hunter to have some cool abilities for a week and then get nerfed into a crater!
Where's my Lorelei?
Sa a l’air bien moue pour du solaire tout sa :(
Bungie what have you done to my perfect subclass!? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO LINE EM UP!?
pvp will be broken for awhile
Hunters have 3 dodges by the way. I’m hyped
Whoever came up with incinerator snap deserves a raise
That tripmine trick, It's like Lost Planet 2 Grenade + Assault rifle combo.
Ahamkara spine is gonna be crazy in crucible
The snap🥵
Bungie loves warlock so much they made them into the mad titan.
It's confirmed. Titans = All Might. Literally every season there's a new way to SMASH!!!!! And I F***ing love it!!!!!
Stop forcing healing on warlocks, add more explosions and better single target supers.
The Titan new melee looks REALLY fun!!!
Hammer slam has me tempted...
Warlocks were definitely inspired by full metal alchemist you can’t tell me other wise. so excited. I love Roy mustangs snap 🫰
PRE NERF FORSAKEN BLADE BARRAGE BABYYYY
its gonna be so much fun playing Titan this season. Can't wait to burn away!
👏👏👏
please bring self res
Something tells me that hunter is going to be op in pvp again
Legit just got mustangs snap from full metal alchemist lol
"...they are the best healers out of the classes..."     THE HELL YOU MEAN THE BEST HEALERS!?!?!?! THEY ARE THE ONLY HEALERS!!!!!!!
The titan slam looks so op but fun
"I like my hammer so I hold one in each hand now." Is like the most titan thing ever lol
Warlock mains stand up! 🔥🔥🔥
Warlock : best class in the game  Devlopper : mhhh giving Warlock an FMA reference ?
Could I have a blink cooldown timer? Cause you know, it’s been left untouched for years now
I love solar and this just makes it better but also for arc for hunter you should add blade dancer
Nothing better than having a thanos snap on warlock.
Beautiful
This is definitely going to be fun to play around with!
Got that Full metal alchemist snap going on all we need now is for it to be able to be charged for rapid fire snaps. BOOM BOOM BOOM
HYPED!!!!
ngl background music sounds like warframe defense mission
Hunters get shafted once again
What about self rez
Time to let the hammer fall
Roy Mustang Warlocks?!
Warlock: Snap like Thanos. Snap like Mustang. Snap like Emet-Selch. In other words, have fun!
So basically we turned titans into hulks
I don't need you or anything now I'll give up when my sun rises down As for now I can see I've become One brief blinding glimpse of the sun - Acroma, "Sun Rises Down"
Wait, Icarus Dash and Icarus Dive? Yeah, it’s good to be a solar warlock main.
I'll never take off Icarus.
classic hunters think your gun is too small? make them bigger! 💥
Ayo, you can phoenix dive AND Icarus dash??
This is so unbelievably cool
Warlock main here:  "Snap!"  "Poof"  😁
Sunbreaker mains eating good.
TIME TO COMMIT ARSON
Yooo going full Roy Mustang on the Warlock, I love it.
Nah that titan slam goes hard
Can't wait to create an endless number of sun spots with my hammer(s) and watch all burn before me.
me, being one of the last people who still use middle tree arcstrider seeing Titans can now do a slide uppercut like we can
Seeing how good the updates for Void and Solar have been makes me extremely excited for Arc 3.0, as a Missile Titan main. I don't know what they could even add, for me personally, but I enjoy the updates very much. Seeing them lean into the identities of the elements is fun.
one thing needs to die, and the guardian survives it lol
ROY MUSTANG X D2
So Hyped for Solar 3.0!
is it just me or does it look like solar warlock doesnt have a rift or icarus dash can replace it? 0:34
I neeeeeed more titan power attacks
Oh.My.God. Titan double bonk ability🫠
Some amazing changes coming with this
2:26 “…is gonna get nerfed.”
When Arc 3.0 comes out, this game will be insane
Moons haunted 2: -electric- solar boogaloo
Icarus dash?
2:59 Holy shit is that Antiope-D
Hunter seems the most boring and weak out of all like always lol hurts to be a hunter main
Bungie saw that i haven't played my warlock as often as i used to so they made Roy Mustang canon on the warlock
I really hope they made blade barrage better
Just like Thanos!!! 😈 3:02
Titan slam go boom
So is this going to only last the first week till its nerfed into the ground?
I just can't wait to play with the large scythe.
My PC died yesterday, great timing!
It looks like the healing dodge and the huge explosive may be baked into the hunter subclass as opposed to being aspects.
Looks sick
Titan fucking
No auto réa for arca > doctrine ussless
I was worried that Gunslingers will be forced into a niche they wouldn't want to fill like in Void 3.0 but this looks awesome
It ain’t self rez but this shit is spicy
Warlocks are Roy Mustang now. Freaking sick.
This looks amazing, can’t wait to slam some more hammers  At least we know arc 3.0 is coming next season
Only 2 hours left
as a terry main i am so happy us titans get a power dunk
Im about to be Roy Fkn Mustang up in this B**CH!!
What is better than one Hammer of Sol? TWO HAMMERS OF SOL!!!!!
SOLAR BUDDY?? IM NOT SEEING IT BUNGO WHERES MY FRIEND
Fire stasis for titan got it
I think I want to re-watch Full Metal Alchemist now.
Why i already hate solar titan on crucible? lmao, the warlock snap and hunter granade seems fun!
Holy crap the titan melee is so badass! Can't wait to play today!!
As a sun breaker main this brings tears to my eyes
Looks incredible. Pissing myself in excitement. Hunter looks like scorpion from mortal kombat. Oh my days bravo bungie 👏👏👏👏👏 much love and respect from england uk. Moons haunted again.
SLIDE SLAM SLIDE SLAM SLIDE SLAM SJDOSJSISWKSHDISKQA
i hate kevin janis so mutch, you guys know he did double primary and that stuff
Holy crap! All three classes have skull helmet ornaments!! Hope these are in the pass and don’t have to be purchased!!
My Warlock to Hive: _"You said I couldn't kill you, but I'd like to prove you wrong! So let's see: How many times is it going to take!"_ *snaps fingers*
It looks like Hunter stole Warlock's Well of Radiance
god bless the lord once we get arc 3.0 all players will be satisfied
Icraus dash and Phoenix dive combined!!
All of these look really, really sick! Also the abilities kinda match off of the class they're on. Titan: emphasis on *bonk* Hunter: "I needed a bigger boom from a small nade, so I duct-taped 3 together." Warlock: "With STYLE, if you don't mind."
Is this already in the game?
this makes me happy
I am so excited
The scenes when warlocks get self-res
Looks cool, just wish I could play the original campaigns I bought :c
😍😍😍
This looks so cool! So excited for this season!
It’s a good day to be a Titan!
I feel so sorry for people fighting Cammy when he's using the Packed Tripmine
Can’t wait for solar 3.0
Can't wait for stasis 4.0
Omfg I can't wait to play my Titan 😁😑😬
Looks like they knocked it out the park again.  Good Work Bungie.
That Titan slam is just my kinda titan jam!
my builds are illegal
I love theses Devs definitely some of my favorites
What goes up...
Better late then never I guess
The color is darker now!
Mmm
The finger snapping  has got my attention
Warlock got killer queen now
No blue flames. Not fun 🫠
That Roy Mustang solar snap is absolutely amazing
im worried for pvp
So Warlock Heals, Hunter Buffs, Titan DPS. Oh shit we D&D now
So no scythe?
cool and all but Destiny needs a new batch of new enemy type like a Hive 4 legged Ogre rhino cause the enemies in this game AI is completely outdated to out right boring to fight even with the new ability changes.
asmuch as i wanted arc to be the next subclass this looks even better then void
Finally this game is looking new and fun.
God I love seeing the behind the scenes looks in these dev commentaries.
As a sunbreaker main so excited for this 🔥🔥🔥
Alright im sold
Solar POWER
Big YES project Caliente!
Yooo you can chain Icarus Dash with Phoenix Dive!!!!!
nice
Incinerator snap tho lol honestly this looks really good. I really enjoy what they did with void.
Jotunn the new Telesto
Dope!!! Make fire go boom! - an excited titan
I’m so hype for this season!
Cant wait to use my solar warmind builds!!!
Roy Mustang Warlock confirmed
Pls change the other hunter arm to be armored too
The Warlocks are getting a Roy Mustang flick.  Im a titan main and that flick makes me jealous af.
I love this types of videos, hoping for more in the future!
Ducktaping heavy explosives together is 100% a hunter thing to do These changes are going to be amazing!
This looks insane can't wait to try it out
So warlock thanos snaps fire that's pretty cool
Can’t wait to get eviscerated by that Titan slam in the crucible
Whos ready to spice up the leviathan?
can it be reset now?
I hope i will be able to use roaring flames and also make sunspots in the same tine
This is gonna be such a fun season
Very very good my brothers i like this game
titians OP
PvP just became a Michael Bay movie
Was that an antiope that I see
I NEED IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!
"Hmmm, let's give hunters another dive"
I am moving to Dawnblade just for the Snap. That's it. No other reason. Coolest ability in-game.
“Balance can never come at expense of fun” yeah ok bungo
yes but please dont nerf calp
*SELF RES = UNINSTALLING*
AYE YOOOOO
let's go new season!
So this is what Bungie considers fun...
The Swarm lore tab really hinted at that hunter change.
IM EXCITED TO BURN PEOPLE TO ASH IN CREATIVE WAYS XD
I love this game
BUUUUUURRRRNNNNNNN
One of these subclasses is gonna be really broken especially for warlocks considering what they did to void so they need to fix it so the game isn’t lame
Devs!!!! I love you! As a D1 main vet this year has been fire 🔥 ;) for you guys keep it up
Bruh I have never been so hyped for solar 3.0 so bad
warlock melee got me like: I am... inevitable
I already know solar 3.0 is going to be insane. So excited for this season.
Woiii
I'm so so so so so so so so so so behind in this game. Is it worth coming back to this game? I'm like a level 30 hunter
HELL YES
Freaking Bungie. Better not disappoint me.  Edit. I'm not disappointed, titans don't look like they got nerfed to hell like usual, warlocks still look too damn OP. And hunters got some cool stuff.
Some men just want to watch the world burn
Yes!!!! Burn baby burn! 😊
