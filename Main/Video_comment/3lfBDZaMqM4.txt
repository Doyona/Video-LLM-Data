Anyone here in 2025?
Where is 2025 crew at????
19:42
Shaneeee! we need another series like this!
anyone watching in 2025?
i lived in cheeseman park for a year. nothing weird ever happened.
i think that's nice about the park actually. that's people's loved ones :) i don't think it's scary. my fish is buried in my rose bush and i think that's nice too. i wouldn't like it if someone's bones washed up because that's sad and they should stay underground, but it's not bc those people are scary or bad.
2025?!!!!!
Of course I’m watching this for the 10+ time in 2025 ❤
5:10 we were taking about the soup and tissue and putting it all over the bathroom. I stool some soup dispensers to make web shooters
4:26 i kinda helped with this, not even knowing it was a trend. I couldve recorded that and got tiktok famous
What if the ghost that attached to shane is the poopoo ghost 😭

2025 anyone?
Watching in 2025!!😊❤
I’m watching this in 2025 and I’m at a point in my life I’m realizing Shane is a medium especially when you think about his family and the thing with the little girl painting and his nana you have so much unrecognized spiritual power Shane!!❤
Lord knows and is returning✝️ couldbe same time or will be alledged aliens,took the Christians( Believers)  Be READY  A Prayer for Salvation  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness.

Anyone here in 2025?
2025?  I miss these types of videos 😭😭
2025 gang
I keep replaying all of these. I mean allllll lol I love them
Every member of Rylands family is hilarious 😂😂😂 i cant stop picturing his dad dressed in all black like a ninja hiding and jumping out to beat the crap out of teenagers vandalizing shlt lmao
I guess every town really does have a Crybaby Bridge 😂
Omgggg I missed this who thinks they should go back again
Plz go to chessmen park
The more I watch this series the better it gets .....
I went to Cheeseman Park when my family and I went to Denver on a trip. A lot of homeless people sleep there as well. I would be interested to ask them if they’ve ever seen anything.
The beat they are trying to say they were hearing is fcking ridiculous. No they do not play like that.
Ya'll should come to Iowa and go to the Villisca Axe Murder House
28:39 im laughing so hard I’m crying…omfg 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shane’s editing skills are god tier 🖤 freaking goosebumps
It’s spooky season again, and this is the only scary documentary I’m watching lol
I love this video ❤❤❤
I love that the dog 9:30 just doesn’t understand one single this humans are talking about but he’s just like yeah! 😀
I’ve been a fan of him since I was 10, I’m turning 20 next year and I absolutely love rewatching his vids
Making the poom chika pom pom
Wasn’t jonbenèt Ramsey also killed in Colorado
i studied the sand creek massacre in high school history 😭 it’s so sad
Hi Shane my name is Kelly , I live in Rural Victoria Australia ,, I believe I have a photo of that Budge ... The photo randomly appeared in a msg to my daughter with no txt or dialogue attached ... I won't load the photo til I hear from you out of respect for the families ... By the way I bloody live ya channel mate
miss morgan so damn much 😢
Lmao Shane’s being haunted by a cowboy
Does the chungus woman not realise she's white?
Hunting huntees?
Can u do moreeeeee 😢
1:05 what is he talking about hahahaha
Indigenous people not native Americans
Lay of the crack pipe jesus
The fact that the natives hung the flags makes me so sad even while being murdered they tried to find peace. What they did to them is so evil🥲🥲
Jesus loves you
love the colorado content!! You should visit Florence Colorado where there's supermax prisions I'm sure there'd be lots of content/horror/conspiracy things there. I've been there and got the creeps
i'm tryna be like grandma lol
And then they claim that the natives took “our land” if this isn't any more clear of colonialism then idk what is..
You did not show us the haunted bridge...😮
daydrinking and rewatching shane dawson vids
I miss Shane's mom!
Why is Morgan so pretty? She has supermodel hair.
Wait, how do we know the native tribe DIDN’T kill the Hungate family in the cabin? This is why it’s hard for me to trust anything about history. The people living and future generations can make up anything and say, “this happened,” and there is no one else alive to dispute it. History can be rewritten hundreds of times before it reaches our ears and we may never know what exactly happened.
Anyone watching again in 2024?
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/npG8cj_ufZw
Ben
Rylands dad is iconic
😂😂😂 I love you
sorry for unsubscribing before
Especially loved the part where Morgan gave the backstory! Shes gorgeous 🥰
my worlds are colliding I love Kendrae so much
mf is a good actor
what is that scary movie that is in the edits please anyone knoww!?? with the girl and boy in the car and then her screaming later and a skeleton coming out of the ground?
I watched this awhile ago but now that I know Chris from the podcast it’s so much more special ❤
MY FAVORITE QUOTES FROM THIS EPISODE  ILL SAVE YOU CRIS  DID THEY RUN OUT OF DANCE MOVES??? NURSE NURSE I WAS IN SCIENCE CLASS AND MY PENIS CAUGHT ON FIRE
rylands grandma is a vibe
I lived in Greeley for 8 yes I know of 2 confirmed haunted places
I spat my drink out when that man was talking about third bridge and he said the batteries dead just like those massacre victims NAH SO UNEXPECTED 💀 18:27
Tiktokers destroying lives and bathrooms. Let’s cancel TikTok and kids having phones😂
i love ur videos but half of it is just random photos and videos, it’s annoying.
There battery powered urinals, there’s not 277 volts😂 there’s no such thing….. fyi
idc if shane pissed people off, i'm not overly sensitive and i am rational enough to know he was just joking around... so i'm really happy to have him back and shame on all the overly sensitive people who "cancelled him" ... y'all aren't perfect
I always wish these were longer <3
25:44 Jonathan Hills ghuost adventures
I love Kendall Rae! 🥹🥹
Who is the youtuber w black hair?
Morgan and Ryland’d dad is hilarious.
Oh it’s dead😮,Like the massacre victims😈
I miss when Shane uploaded frequently. I took that time for granted. 💔
The voice that says “Shane” 3:10
Can we talk about how Shane teased us with this Cheeseman park information? Doing a ghost investigation on the park would be a awesome video ❤❤❤❤
Shane why are your lips so white all the time
bro protect the grandma at all cost, she is so sweet and innocent
10:26
Morgan =∆
I remembere when the bathroom stuff was happening thry closed every bathroom exept the ones right next to the office and we had separate building and at least 20 closed they eventually opened more but then all the boys ones got closed then some stuff about dress code happened and girls were supergluing posters that said ‘my body my choice’ to the wall like im all for that and self expression but don’t superglue it dude, and girls bathrooms got closed agian
9:58
Love to go on a date with Morgan she so funny and beautiful
School kids" *destroying schools and bathrooms* lol yasssss  Also school kids: *cancel celebs for making dumb jokes 15 years ago*
Everyone saying they heard “Native American drums” has never heard them in their lives lmao they’re not used to play pop rhythms
Listening to the story behind and what happened to the Native Americans literally makes me feel sick in every single cell in my body. 🥺 I cannot stand the evil man is capable of. Smfh. I just want to apologize to the universe for all of us because ew. Imagine being that cruel.
as i am a native american cree and lakota we were forced onto reservation but plot twist its the most beautiful thing we live on
Also in Colorado there’s a haunted road called river dale road
Aww I love grandma 🥹. When she said “I don’t think I could keep up with my walking” killed me ): she probably wishes she could go 🥺💛
Ugh so many pathetic fangirls and fanboy who still watch shanes stupid debunkable videos
My favourite part of the video? Nana petting the pup! It's so sweet. 2nd favourite part? Dad babying the other pup!
Y’all too
Y’all too
Why was the face of that Nathan Hungate (?) blurred?
Idk why but Shane Dawson popped up in my head at work and lowkey I was just eating Pringle’s watching Netflix and decided to watch you so hopped on YouTube for a second and was just thinking how comforting you were to me as a kid. I used to watch you everyday. I guess I kinda missed having that comfort when things were going to shit and I guess I need that comfort again. I know the media says that your problematic but like bruh. Everybody on this gosh darn earth is problematic. Idk
As soon as you said sand creek massacre, I went straight back to year 9 history GCSEs
this is edited so well
When you destroy a culture decency dissolves. You can't be surprised.
Morgan had a glow-up she is SO beautiful!!!!
I miss these sm 🥺
Can we point out how gorgeous Morgan is fr 🥺
Morgan is so damn beautiful, just looking at her face is satisfying. Whomever ends up being her boyfriend is a really lucky guy.
devious licks 😭👎
GRANDMA RUNN!!!!!  Grandma- huh?
Rewatching on October 28th 2022
8:00 15:45
Rylands dad absolutely owns a red hat… iykyk 😂😂😂
When you see "I've missed you" in a scary font and you can't help but take it in a nice and heartwarming way.
Why did Shane come back to YouTube, I am surprised.
Still waiting for a vid on Cheesman Park 🙏
🕷️
Okay I’m starting my new day job as soon as we get the Scottish lions a big deal forget the only my projections look at all of those I’m invalid and disabled and the cats too that’s where I am you are a big deal like I said but eahhhh Jamie and Mike edit with love no need though I’m all smiles and without a wink I’ll not say a baby daughter with Marissa and all of them oh warlocks too = but mooKEYYy dreaming it just means 4 times 6 kittens I’m all smiles
Idk...why he is lookin like gay😂
I lived in Colorado a whole 22 years of my life and only recently moved. There is so much I had no idea about. I've been to the Denver Botanic Gardens many times. That crazy to think there are bodies that were buried where is now stands.
bro why do people put like rip to all the people who died out there i dont think ghosts gonna see that
The intro of this like driving in the car rylan like we’re home reminds me of some haunted start to a movie LIKE
Who is the black hair girl talking
I don’t think it’s haunted at all
THOSE DRUMS ARE PUMP JACKS
Where’s part two?
why is shane still on youtube
The fact that this was already literally 10 months ago doesn’t feel real
Goddamn Morgan thick af 🥵
The iwtb guy caught me off guard
Why does the clock ticking remind me of stranger things😭😂
The editing while talking about Cheesman Park is next level. I hope Shane ends up doing a video there!
I feel like they are trying to make this Washington/Oregon. Y’all know that’s where ppl get murdered
Those aren’t war drums.. those are the drums of ceremony. Calling in God and ancestors to come in and help.. it’s fitting.
Shane is literally iconic
32:09 That's the scariest thing in the entire video.
That didnt look like ketchup
i wonder where shane's mom is....
Ok but like. I was the biggest simp for Morgan when I was like 17 👀
Pick a goddamn focal point and stick to it!!! Jesus, who in this group has ADD?
Imagine a Sam and Colby and Shane collab
No bc when I was watching this, I kept hearing random thumps and footsteps, Stuff falling down, AND My curser starting moving but shaking at the same time and that never happened before
mostly stolen research by smaller creators - nice
I love your dad!! He states facts lol
We had something similar with our bathrooms well the girls but wasn't that bad it was the stall doors calling down because I'm guessing the girls would unscrew the screws or would kick it down don't know entirely
To what Morgan said in the beginning... I think the person meant apparition... aspiration is something that means something totally different.
as someone who deals with spirits on a daily basis i cannot help but cringe pls seek out someone who knows their way around energy fOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE
Why was the genocide man's face blurred? Does anyone know?
I haven't seen y'all in a while
13:48 not all bad people, there were good people still buried don’t group them in with the other  17:58 💀 imagine thanking that clip out of contexts LMFAO 😂
I am in shock. The entity that was described to Shane, I’ve seen him before in my dreams. He’s been following me too and has been for a while now. I could never make out a face but he’s exactly how that girl described him. It’s him. I even seen him during my sleep paralysis’s when I would force myself to go back to sleep out of fear. I would not be then accompanied by a lucid dream in which I was in control even in knowing I was asleep. Instead I would see him manipulating the things I saw and taking me places back in time to different scenarios. Like he was trying to show me something. I couldn’t grasp it I suppose. But till this day I can see a particular place he brought me that was a desert where you could imagine an old western would take place in black and white.
Grandma is the sweetest ever pls
I’ve forgave and forgotten abt Shane’s past I still love watching his videos he makes me happy 😊
Watching this in 2022 after 'Stranger Things' season 4 is released made me really jump at the clock noise at the beginning of this video. 🥲🤣
Ryland’s Dad is a riot 😂😂😂
I know I'm late af to the party but I'm so happy that you're now a fellow coloradian 🥰 welcome and I wish you the happiest and healthiest life with ryland and his family away from all the toxicity of LA. I love you Shane keep your head up and heart full 🖤❤️
https://youtu.be/V7rdPrOt6kI
NGL Morgan is really hot and im really into her.
25:15 ok when she talked about the hand prints on the cars I  believed her, because I live in ecuador, and there is also a haunted bridge were i live, and there is some cases that when people pass the bridge by car they hear taping above them or when they go waking the air gets thicker or like they feel like something is pushing them down they, idk how to describe it. soo some guys put baby powder on top of there car and pass the bridge and when they go check, they see fingerprints on there car. sooo ya Edit: the reason its haunted is because the bridge is located next to a mountain or cliff and some kids when passing the bridge, there was a avalanche of dirt and rock and they ended up dyeing
does  he still fuck cats
❤️
25:07 yea its called a drum dance unless its fast
Why did they include the corpse flower lmfaooooo. That had literally nothing to do with dead bodies.
Omg my mom would knock and walk in too. She passed a few years ago but that cracked me up bc I said the same thing Morgan did, like why even knock? But Ryland's dad about the urinals 🤣
omg can we talk about the brown pup?! its so cute! what is it!!????
"shes fixing our problems" laughs "u wish!" hahahahaha
"No phone service, so they were more likely to makeout"... 🤔 keep an eye on ryland
Not y’all forgetting what he did
Damn rylands mom looks so young and pretty
16:57   All I’m saying is why all the ghost gotta be old? like why can’t we have a ghost from 2010 who flips the radio to lady Gaga and is a baddie listening to throwback songs
Never ever forget about the goddamn toilet they stole like wow Who forgets about the goddamn toilet
im kind of in love with morgan
jumping on the morgan looks SO GOOD train
Shane, you need to jet over to UK and see our ghosts.
There's so many burial grounds on which buildings were built on top of here in Indonesia.
Pls make more plssss
I know it's a clip from a different video, but at 31:28 there was DEFINITELY some mic interference in that clip from some entity.
awe wish i could take Morgan out on a date
Shane has made a YouTube video talking about him taking accountability for what he did, he did mess up but he’s said he’s sorry and it hasn’t happened again. If y’all don’t like him then don’t comment or like it! It’s not hard use your brain! He’s doing it to have fun! Leave the man alone! He’s human he messed up and he’s getting better with his actions and what he says 🤷‍♀️💜
Can i just say that the brown dog Rylands dad has is freaking ADORABLE. I WANNA CUDDLE IT SO BADLY.
Great video!!🥰  Does anyone know what film clips where featured in this video? The zombie one and the car following the girl?
I agree with the dad about the school bathrooms. The kids don’t realize how much goes into the schools features. A lot of schools already struggle to keep me essential things like paper and even lightbulbs in stock for use. They literally have a limit on paper. They don’t have kidney to repair toilets and sinks
no bc I heard the drums. Girl- If I hear drums irl I’m leavin’.
Can’t wait to leave California I hate this liberal, cancel culture, fascist, hypocritical state. I’m glad you guys are back. You guys were missed 🥰
I CAN’T WITH THE DAD TALKIN BOUT LICKS
how was this uploaded SIX months ago??!?!! it seems like just yesterday shane posted this 😭
As someone who is in high school, the vandalism is pretty bad. It only really started this year. I can't go to the bathroom without there being no soap or paper towel dispensers. One time I found a whole soap dispenser off the wall and in a sink, clogged with paper towels and over flowing with water. For a while the school stopped supplying us with soap because of the vandalism, during covid and the flu season! A lot of our janitors quit as well, we only have four janitors in the entire school with a student body of 2,000+ Just a little rant about the school vandalism.
It’s not like kids are learning anything valuable in school anyway
I live near Cheeseman park. Love going there at night 🖤 I just googled it and I live a 6 min drive from it lmaoooo I live in capital hill 🤣
The fact my name is Cheyanne-.. 😭😭
at 2:38-2:40 you can hear a boy say “hello”
If that bridge was called "Third bridge" before people went there to get "Third base" then we are completely living in a simulation 😄
I luv the part where it keeps switching from the guy saying what people do in the park. "Play frisbee" terror "yoga" terror "walk your dog" terror 😄
Rylands dad is woke!
I love rylands family so much. Especially dad and grandma!! But really all of them.
Damn this is pretty dark
i'll always try to be here for you with anything
that's a mistake
“That is the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced in my whoooole 24 years on this face of this stratosphere.”  - Morgan
i’m in love with morgan
Man I’m new to the channel. The first video I’ve seen of the girl(assuming a sister) is when you were doing the remote viewing, UGGGGH IM IN LOVE. She so bad! I’d def be her night in shining armor 😍😍😍😍
I love this video so much the whole “Adams family” is so funny and sweet and Morgan is just stunning
maybe it was a Wendigo or a Skinwalker that skinned the guys family… you never know 👀
Morgan is so hot!
I love Shane
I heard a drum beat but I heart singing too!! That’s not an oil thing it’s native drumming and singing
18:37  I'm dead 💀 🤣
Missed ya shane <3
“DONT SAY THAT ON CAMERA!” LMFAO i love rylands mom
21 seconds in and I already can’t breathe “viewer discretion always advised”
That’s the story line of “frozen 2” but Disney put a twist on the story to make it kid like..
Rylands dad is the definition of mood
morgan is litro so pretty like 🤤🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️
Rylands dads is a comedian!!!
Morgan is so hot
15:26 MORGAN LOOKS SO HOTV OMG
0:40 DAMN WTF MORGAN LOOKING SNATCHED
Shane you should definitely hang out with Adam and Amy from Kindred Spirits!
deveas licks
Seriously, and I’ve ALWAYS thought this, but Morgan is gorgeous!
I’ve been subscribed to you since I was 11, how did I not see this before
WTF why did I just find out about this video??
I love hearing you guys talk about my home state especially how Morgan gets into the story telling of what happened
People forgot to hit like bottom because the vedeo is much interesring
Students destroying property is common, but now that there are more kids, there are more bad eggs among the bunch.
The fact that morgan mentioned another one of my fav youtubers makes me so happy like i trade off between shane and kendall omgggg
NEXT VIDEO: GO TO CHEESMAN PARK AT NIGHT!! PLEASE!
The beginning was so good. It sucked me right in
Keep it up 💕
I missed this so much ❤️❤️❤️
That JUMP SCARE at the very end... Not cool Shane, not cool :/  jk love you! love these new videos & I'm so glad that you're back!
Morgan Is So Beautiful.
i love how it gets scary then shane makes a joke its making my brain confused but calm
Make a movie
Tik tok is toxic the fact that people think this is okay, while people barely make enough to support themselves. But don't you live in Trump country? lol
wait why is Ryan's mom so iconic, like seriously and whenever I see 2018 I'm like " omg guys that was befoore covviiiiddd ✨"
bruh how is moving a whole cemetery even okay? i could never be involved or even THINK about being involved in that shit…. hello demons
Is this part 2?
I relate to Chris too much
Has anyone else seen the tall dude with a coat and cowboy hat?
The guy throwing the battery is literally me
very sad
"Everybody talking about creepy ghosts" Morgan: Did you know the Orange came back?
this got released while I was in labor with my 2nd baby I shouldve watched it then to pass the time I would've been so happy ;'(
Was Hittin them devious licks 😈 forgot ab that
Can I just say Morgan is gorgeous
I love Bruce, omg 😂❤️❤️❤️
Wow I missed your videos.  Hope you make many.
This is overly dramatic
Ayoo morgan bad af 😈
As much iffy stuff Shane has done his content is really entertaining and I kinda love watching it lol
Side note- really glad you moved to a small town. We need more liberals moving to these places to shake things up from the blatant ignorance that penetrates these towns. As a liberal that moved to a small town in GA, you wouldn’t believe how narrow minded people are. It’s honestly disturbing.
can we pause and just point out that Morgan is STUNNING
The only thing that doesn't follow Shane is a diet.    Jokes! I had to!
now THIS IS A CONTENT ... THANK YOU SHANE FOR COMING BACK 💜
So excited when I seen ohmygosh
My husbands last name is McGovern..
I always have a crush on Morgan 🥰
I just watched the simulation video and was scrolling through YouTube while watching this and saw an add for a bathroom redecorator the same time the school bathroom subject came up. I would also like to say I read the word bathroom the same time he said bathroom. I'm convinced..   It's a simulation...
Rylands dad is an actual mood
Grandma reminds me of my nana who just passed 🥺so pure and silly
A Kendall Rae and MORGAN COLLAB ARE YOU KIDDING
Omg shane i missed you and always loved you i was raised on your old videos and loved them so hatters gonna hate but I’ll always love you 😍
The fact that children these days get entertainment from destroying soap dispensers & urinals is extremely disappointing & gives me no hope for their generation. And Rylands dad is correct. California is extremely toxic (although Colorado is not too far behind in all honesty) all a product of poor so called "leadership"
Y’all are forgetting what SHANE DID. Let’s not even forget the pedophilla,beastlity,racism and ALSO taking actions on of all of that. Shane Is an awful person.
My grandparents have lived in Denver my whole life and EVERYTIME we visit them we go to the Botanical Gardens. It's scary to think about what I've been walking on this whole time...
"Why are they destroying bathrooms? Did they just run out of dance moves?" Lol
Have you ever heard of the hat man?
I HAVE MISSED U SO MUCH !!!
All of you are soft if you hated his old content... Youtube thrived off of dark humor back then. Its not till recent years dark humor is being avoided and cancelled. His shit was funny and still is. Aged a bit but still funny. Grow a pair and watch some filthy frank or old maxmoefoe.
Shane's videos are genius.  Like no other youtuber compares. Hes got a great team too to help these come to life.
Coming from a Native American, this story really touched me. Rest In Peace to those innocent people.
THE WAY THE INTRO MADE MY SMILE LIIIGHT UP OMG. :). SO GOOD LOVE U BABES
Glad you’re back ❤️ needed this content back in my life 🥲
ryanlands dad is iconic
Grandma is such a mood, bless her 🥺💖
Aurora is the place where the shootings took place at a Batman premiere also
Shane you should go to the most haunted road in Thornton Colorado! I’ve been there and it’s the most scariest things I’ve experienced!
It’s a good come back Shane ❤️
iphone camera is better in the dark, oh god...
@32:14 Morgan:”the annoying orange is back” … Shane:”reflects back to his parody with the annoying orange” lol… “WHY WONT YOU DIE….ILL NEVER DIE” 😂😂😂😂
i used to see a shadow figure in my childhood home with a Hat and when i seen that photo shivers! i did a lot of research into this shadow figure and he goes by the name 'Hat Man' you can find quite a lot about him and a lot of people seeing the same figure same hat same shape full black no features no face, i eventually went to a medium just for a session never mentioned anything about the figure just did card readings and she knew what i seen where it would stand in my bedroom everything. i've been moved out living with my husband for 4 years and i haven't seen the figure since , when i researched about it , it said it can appear to people that are in a bad place meaning the house they are in can be in my case a house of dark memories soon as i moved out i haven't seen since.
It’s pretty ignorant for her to say that the people left were mostly criminals. Likely they are poor people or minorities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6cM36Cm27U
Oh no its cool I just had a friend that used to live like maybe 15 minutes from there out in butt fuck Kiowa 🤣🤣 can't go to his house anymore big nope
Hmmmmm as some one who used to live in Aurora and now lives only 20 minutes away nah 🤣🤣🤣
Get off of YouTube Shane you’ve been forgiven enough times
Fuckin aye i missed you shane! Love the fam dynamic!! This is a great refreshing start to something beautiful and creepy!
Rylands dad is literally hilarious
Morgan single?
Inc I live in Aurora Colorado wow
Shane i thought this was good bye but ... i thought you were..? shane one of the reasons why i stop watching you was because i thought you would not post so i was watching the same thing over and over again and again and you were getting boredng for me so i stop
18:37 dead like the victims, just cracked me up
Also the like ten human heads stolen from a medical truck last week CO is wild
I live in Denver Crashed the wedding at cheeseman once they were nice and let us join 😂. Also it's nice to drink margaritas at the park and even though there's a bunch of dead bodies
MORGAN IS SOOOO FINEEEEE GAHHHH
i literally went to 3rd bridge last night with my friends and some car like chased us for 20 minutes 💀 went for the first time and i didn’t know all the background so im like damn
The person in the review said aspiration but it’s apparition 😅
Rylands dad is the most passionate person I’ve ever seen. Any topic he goes 110%
What the hell is with that woman whose videos clips are shown? All criminals and bad people? wth?! That's an awful thing to say, and outright false! Many were simply poor, or didn't have family around anymore. Others were simply missed as a result of bad management, records etc. I'm sure Shane doesn't think that way, but maybe take it as a warning to be very careful and vet any clips you include.
I find it really interesting how different cultures and peoples approach death (or try to act like it doesn't exist, which isn't healthy at all but is something the majority of us are terrible with in The West). We really need to be more death positive. Even in cultures where people are much more superstitious they have a better relationship with death, places of disposition etc. This actually plays into the kinds of places people believe are haunted.
I'm literally wearing my spiraling hoodie right now as he wears the shirt! Yes, I'm easily pleased lol
Ok but who is Chris!!!!???
Found out my house is a spirit highway 👀
“My electric car attacked my ass when my wife left me and my horse died”   so iconic
🏃🏃
I liked this video very good
Should really investigate Riverdale road starts in Thornton and goes all the way to Brighton. There’s always been talk about riverdale road when I was growing up, if you put flour on top of your trunk and leave your car in neutral someone will push your car for you and there will be hand prints on the trunk. People also say that if you’re alone a woman in a white dress will get into your car and ask for a ride home but will disappear almost immediately.
i love how you put good music over whats being talked about in the video, really makes it more interesting, and less scary
USA ALWAYS KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE UNTIL NOW ✌
Shane I've watched you since I was around 15 years old I'm now 29. I just wanted to say that even though the world doesn't love you. That God loves you so much that he sent his only begotten Son to die for your sins. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son. Whoever believes in him (that Jesus was crucified, buried, raised on the 3rd day according to scripture and now sits at the right hand of God) shall not perish but have eternal life. Repent of your sins and turn toward God he is faithful to forgive not like we are.  And he's the only Judge. Romans 3:23 For ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. All of us have made mistakes and we continue to make them everyday. But without God we are doomed to live lives in the dark. GOD IS THE LIGHT. THE THE DARKNESS WILL NEVER OVERCOME IT. also ps. You have a spiritual spouse which is demons. Which is why you have sexual dreams. I know because I've been through it before when I was an atheist. GOD BLESS YOU SHANE HE LOVES YOU I LOVE YOU. I PRAY YOU CONSIDER MY WORDS. in the mighty name of Jesus amen 🙏
morgan bad
Shane should totally play phasmophobia
“Ugh it’s dead.. like the massacre victims.. anyway so what I’m doing now” 😭😭😭 homie has no chill
You fell off so hard lmaoooooooo from 24 mil to 3mil views
Can you please do cheeseman park next
Bruh watching this makes me so scared and what makes me cry is my brain because it’s literally thinking of wanting to sell my soul to the devil which is scaring me a lot because what if he actually comes
We missed you too queen ( shane)
Sorry I must be old af but wtf is a teenage Kiki spot? 😂
PEDIIIIIIII
Where not destroying, it’s called a devious lick 😈
those tiktoks of ppl destroying the bathroom bout dumb asf
I’m late watching this!! I totally missed it before but I am loving it! I love Rylands family, his dad is cracking me up 😂😂
Morgan is so pretty
So glad your back Shane 🙌
Do a video on cheesman park now!!!!
I don't respect what he did but oml i love his videos
PLEASE GO TO OTHER PLACE TOOOO
#sexysixyearold???
I missed shane's haunting videos so so much
Shane, go to the most haunted prison in the United States, Moundsville penitentiary, in West Virginia. It’s called the West Virginia state penitentiary
1:04 Tell your sister it's "A-PAH-RIH-SHON" not "A-SPER-AY-SHON" :) Not aspiration.
Don’t get me wrong I’m very happy with this but I would loooooove the scary memories with drew and Garrick
I have always  had paranormal things has happened to me and still but I am not scared
JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW… SHANE SAID NAKED BABIES WERE SEXY! Fucking Google it. I’m disgusted and unsubscribing IMMEDIATELY!!!!!
Why did you move? Love Ruby ❤️🧡❤️🧡
Ryland's dad is so pure and innocent its so cute i need more Bruce content
HELLO 💘 IT ALL & THANK U 4 STORY TELLER BEAUTIFUL MORGAN & THE WHOLE FAMILY IS INVOLVED YES THANK U CAN'T WAIT 4 NEXT VID KEEP THEM COMING ❤ BSAFE SAGE CRYSTALS & CROSS 2 U ALL
I'm not gonna share my opinions on shane or the video, but I LIVE in aurora CO, so watching this and finding out about what happened here is truly horrific...
Dude thank you for including all the Native American history in this video. So important
Everthing just Kind catchy I love it ! But could you Please Lowerin the Music ? Thanks !
Eh the park doesn't seem scary. I live alone on 60 acres right beside the New River. As a kid I would find arrow heads all the time in the corn fields. I'm sure there are bones up and down the property especially right next to the new river one of the oldest rivers in the world
The people in this comment section trying to justify what shane did by diminished the severity of it is simply disgusting. Anyone who finds children attractive is a beast!!!children aren't meant to be looked at in such a way!
HES BACK🤩🤩
How awful 😞  natives got and still get the WORST treatment here 😞 and then people don’t understand why people may hold grudges towards the white race, they have undoubtedly done AWFUL AWFUL things to human beings for no other reason than to conquer them and to steal from them.
Morgan it’s ok 😂 the world is EXTRA EXPENSIVE right now. It’s amazing to have parents that let you come back home because it’s just really rough out there. Never be ashamed.
the kendall reference made me happy :’)
You know your on the good side of tiktok when you’re shocked by the trends.
bruh hearing the drums made me freak out lol
The fact that I’ve lived here my whole life and have never heard of this...WHAT
Some might hate Shane, but let’s appreciate the incredible editing and effort that go into these videos.
I love u Shane I’m glad ur back everything that was hold against you was bull shit love u Shane
The fact that my school shut all the bathrooms down an locked them an if we had an emergency office staff would have to got into the bathrooms with us
Shane’s dad is so precious
No bc I would LOVE to see you go ghost hunting with OmarGoshTv👏🏽👏🏽
I've missed all of you
I LOVE YOU SHANE!!! LIKE IT UP!!!!
You need to make the conspiracy theories again
32:11 scariest part of video 😂😂😂
Omg Shane (my fav YouTuber) had flashes of a video by OmarGosh (my 2nd fav) !! MY DREAM! Now just collab and I’ll be so HAPPY! ❤️❤️🤣🤣
It's National 🤣
I'm just gonna say it. I'm watching YT and suddenly miss your videos, search for your channel and let me just say, I'm glad I saw 3 new upload from you. I wish you the best Shane.
Thank God you're back!! ❤❤❤🐑
Proud Northern Arapaho right here!💪🏼  Try coming to our reservation in Wyoming - U haven't seen nothing yet!🤣🤣
Shane dawson kinda looks anf sounds like ronald stilzskin from shrek 3? I think its shrek 3. Anyways no hate just had to get it outa my head.
all ready planning a trip to colorado cause I live on Highway 36 now I have two spots on my list first  The  Stanley hotel now this one
18:36 dead
Cancel culture too far, look what they did to my boy!!
well.. https://youtu.be/E7MBhfJaTEc
why do you still have a career? you didn't apologize, you deleted videos only after being called out. I hope there's still people out there, that remember that you slithered your way through all of this.
per very
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6cM36Cm27U&t=3404s
I need a collab with kendall rae ASAP.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
my biggest nightmare would be for my dog to just hand me a human bone O.O
Guess we all came full circle friends   Finally ran out of new things to watch. Reunion was inevitable at some point.
Bro I love Shane’s videos I hope he keeps posting
sorry i loved this so much
Ew
You haven't learnt a thing. How can you have such little consideration for what you have done. You have made this as if it's something that happened to you and not something you did.
can we talk about first how amazing the video is and second how i was crying laughing, then how amazing morgan looks? omg
I hate to say it but third bridge honestly really does Interest me and it sounds freaky asf but also mysterious and Morgan’s story legitimately made me uneasy, especially the teens going off the road and passing away
It’s so good to see you doing this again!!
Rylands from Colorado me too
i’m so glad shane still posts sometimes
Litterly my birthday
There’s no way the murder rates higher in Arapaho than LA county. No fucking way.
ζ
zamn this was on my b day, miss you shane
I want a heart from ya please please please... ❤ 💕 🍷 🍎
Rwar xd*
Came from Ryland's vlog channel, and I am so weirded out to see the same people in this video, in such a different genre, I cant fathom it hahahahahah  Rylands vlog: 💫💝👨‍❤️‍👨🍃🌄🦄🍩🎀👑🧜‍♂️ Shane's content: 👹🔪🕸️🕯️🪓🪦⚰️🚫🆘🔪
I love your videos
can we talk about the guy licking the battery? 😂😭 like what
UHMMMM- MORGAN IS GIVING ME HELLA GENDER ENVY, literally gorgeous ily queen
POST MORE I MISSED THESE
thank you for coming back ❤️
AHHHHHH I LOVE MELINDA!!!!!
I don't know if you'll see this Shane but I'm so glad that you guys are back I missed you guys horribly and you guys are so loved
my animal crossing island is named colorado, and it’s safe. so i’m not sure what you’re all going on about.
Wtf you guys, I had no idea you were back at it!!! I’m so happy! I was rewatching all your videos & realized I hadn’t seen this one! Love you guys! & Shane, you’re my fave YouTuber, been watching your content for years, I hope you always feel like making videos & know more people support you than not. We know you’re a great guy & you make great content, what’s not to love? ❤️
This family is so adorable
“I don’t wish harm on anybody….BUT I hope that-“
8:51 - Rylands dad knows what's up..."CA is very toxic."  It truly is. I feel so bad for any decent people that are stuck there and can't get out for whatever reason.  People who move to CA always either change for the worse or develop extreme depression because they don't fit in with the rest of the toxicity there.
They’re tryna get ahold of him for something. Bet he’s psychic and doesn’t realize it yet.
Shane y did u stop doing conspiracy’s ??
I legit don't care if he is  "canceled" or not he will forever be in my heart and he knows what he did was wrong. Growing up is realizing what people on social media think about you doesn't matter if you still want to make the content you want to make then go for it even if some people don't like you.
We love you Shane!! I'm so proud of how far you've come even with all the hardships you've been through. Everything will be okay. I believe you with my whole soul. Thank you for staying strong 💕❤️
I love Shane his series but this new cameraman and the shaking makes where I can’t even watch the video without getting nauseous.
🤍🤍🤍🤍💙💙💙💙
I NEED YOU TO FILM WITH SAM & COLBY
Morgan really loves bringing up the race shit. News flash doll, you're white. What those people did was horrific but shut up with the "white assholes" shit. They were assholes, period
Don’t worry I sharted three times while watching this video. That’s how much of a load of shit it is.
Has to be a white man, na its probably just a man protecting his property quit it
MORGAN😍😍😍😍😍
Morgan is so beautiful bruhh like !!!
I missed these videos!
I live for this shit.
Oh how I've missed you 😭
Ghosts don't exist. People spook too easy or fake. Morgan is entitled.
I remember the creatures going here years ago 😭 full circle with my fav you tubers
Did anyone else hear something say Shane at 3:10 before he closes the door?
Beuh
Hey bro we have the same birthday july 19
i live for vids like these and ur conspiracy theories ong
ANGIEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hah
I'm so excited you guys moved here, I also live In aurora, and have been to third bridge  You can also Check out riverdale road
I know it’s already been said so much but why the hell is Morgan so pretty 😭😭
Miss you
I love the grandma she is so cute
Imagine it’s just someone with loud speakers playing drum sounds
I’m so disappointed, there are so many of you that are just forgetting what he did. Just because it’s been a year doesn’t make the creepy things he’s done go away
ew
“anyways, we’ll do that another time.” 😭😭✋🏻
YESS THE SPOOKY GANG add on Chris😝
love the switch up…thought y’all said y’all hated him…
I probably shouldn’t be watching this late at night… BUT I’m going to anyway. I’m just gonna binge all of Shane’s creepy videos
Shit I hear drumbeats
Morgan's sudden fascination with accountants amuses me
Omfg "she wouldn't hear them coming"
Shane if you've ever had a dream or sleep paralysis about the "cowboy man" please have a chat to me or reply to this because I saw a man like that one night in a dream when I was really young and I still remember it vividly
Omfg Rylands dad is my pop. I apologised for not seeing him (my pop) on Christmas day and he replies with *It's okay 2021 just didn't have the vibe, a vibe*   It was so hilarious I had to stop myself from a full blown laughing fit.
This park with all of the bodies is interesting but if you stop and really think about it. There really aren't very many places where you won't find some form of animal or even human remains buried underground. The Earth is 8 billion years old and the first humans were walking around in Africa almost 2 million years ago.
Hold up your posting agian
It's been 3 years since I watched your vids bro
these are the shittiest quality videos ever made & i can’t believe y’all act like you’ve forgotten shane’s even shittier behavior
I LOVE YOU SHANE, I’m so glad you’re back🖤
I think this is hilarious, I’ve lived in Denver all my life and gone to third bridges multiple times and the only thing I’ve ever encountered is teens trying to catch a charge out there lmao
They seem so fun to hang out with
At 2:39 you can her what I think is a female with a lower voice say “hello” when Morgan stats to talk I’m scared y’all
Go to cheesman parkkkk and experience it.
I remember a girl on here commenting on your video of this somewhere else, a girl said her mom looked exactly Exactly Like the woman holding her head
I’ve been waiting for your return 🥺
I recently broke the 4th wall of reality.  I suspect I might actually be dead and lingering in purgatory or some such jacked up dimension.
I just booked a hotel a few streets away from this park for a concert that’s coming up and I have no idea. Like I’m from Kansas normally the spooky places in videos are no where close To me and now I’m going to add ghost hunting to my trip schedule
I get a shit lode of Commercials while watching this and it maid me happy bc I’m like “ oh is Shane getting paid “  I swear to god if I find out that he is getting no add revenue from me dealing with them I will be pissed af
Morgan it’s an apparition not an aspiration
Im Chirtsy-kun
We missed you so much Shane ❤
Do they still have their dog, Uno?
Shane has always been my comfort zone on youtube no matter what, whenever i’m free and bored I come here and watch his videos over and over and still be entertained
Damn you really changed I havent watch you in 5 years or 2 years  I love you man keep up the good work
Also when going to a haunted location never read reviews or stories. Why. Because your mind will be filtered and you will want to hear or see something. Be open minded and clear headed then review after
https://youtu.be/K6cM36Cm27U
cringe compilation video part 928
Omg your backkkkkkk ❤️❤️❤️
❤
OMG SHE HAS A BLAHAJ
This comment section disgusts me
I missed your videos so much 🥺
What ever happened to the old camera guy
"this one's dead....Like the mascre victims.." I CHOKED ON MY GREEN BEANS 😭😭😭😭
.....little sus there are no bad comments. Almost like their being deleted. 👀
Fuck that's Kardashian level acting. "Yeah that people have actually died out there it's really sad" Sure queen
Beautiful souls draw out the evilest people
I missed the laughing,The group jokes and all of them getting along,Glad he came back old suber here
I don’t know about you guys, but when Shane stopped posting it seemed like the world turned on each other and everyone was so hateful. I felt alone. Him coming back with this series gives me comforting nostalgia and in a weird way gives me a hopeful feeling. Glad most people feel the same :) welcome back Shane!
20:59 what movie is that? can't remember..
So happy you're back <3
if you watch this without taking it serious its quite funny
csoo cssspooky
7:28 LMFAOO BRUCE 💀💀
Rylands dad is def a Republican trump supporter.
Why do they keep bringing up the fact that they white it’s irrelevant ffs
Not me watching this at 3:33 in the morning lol
I love you Shane please stay.
i believe in u shane i think the government planted stuff on u
The music editing around the guy calmly telling the story about third bridge in his garage is cinematic perfection thank you shane
I love grandma
Rylands dad a W
2 years wasn't enough time to get rid of your stank on YouTube
I have been missing yall
Shane : "demons follow me everywhere" Morgan: "srry did you know the annoying orange is back"
#pickasideyoutube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7rdPrOt6kI
#pickasideyoutube
lol pls leave native american spirits alone
I have no idea why I laughed so hard at this  *intense music* : “This TOILET is covered in KETCHUP”
Video: YOUR WATCHING Me: Disney channel ٩( ᐛ )و
So glad you are back.
I'm loving this series but really wish Shane would put the users tags at the bottom of those little snippets
i love these types of videos
Shane I'm so glad to see you back . We missed you I did completely
Didn’t you pull a fucking EDP a year ago
morgan is so pretty🤍
Ive miss them so much, Im genuinely so happy theyre back
Rylands Dad had me laughing so hard lol 🤣🤣🤣
Travel the country and do these
Shane, are you going to do another cosmetics collaboration with Jeffree Star?
TikTok is garbage. You’re pretty stupid if you have to record yourself destroying a public bathroom to get attention online. I hope they get punished severely for it.
Oh, wow, he moved to Colorado? What compelled him to move out of California?
I'm only 3 minutes in, and it's 3:30AM and I'm sitting up in the dark watching this, and then the power goes out and our bright outdoor security lights go on. I'm shit scared lmao
Bro I’m Arapaho and I NEVER that the Governor did that I
ur mid
#pickasideyoutube
Yay your back ♥️♥️♥️
https://youtu.be/2jrvWUNHSPQ
I just LOVE rylands dad
I am an accountant js
MammaMax calls to you Shane.
Missed these videos
this nigga chris so irritating 💀def not watching anymore of these
Ghosts don’t exist in LA because of the homeless people and lack of water
Your videos makes me positive and kinder to people….keep posting I’ve become an asshole while you’re gone
Bro I just got my new car but I’m convinced it’s haunted…it plays weird random Spotify music or just does weird shit. I live on my own in a college town away from anyone I know. This is the first time in my that I believe in ghosts and tbh it adds flavor to my white&gray life but it’s not the kinda flavor I like
Haven’t watched the video yet and I already liked it because I already know it’s going to be good😎 I can’t wait for more conspiracy videos!
Shane is still one of the best Youtubers to date. end of discussion.
This is really off topic but how the hell did shanes voice turn Feminine All sudden?
do theories about the travis scott incident
I hope you are baack!
SHANE POST AGAIN!
She realizes she white as well right
Morgan is hot.
Shane I miss ur old conspiracy videos please start doing them again
I'm Arapahoe haaayyyy
In my town in Australia, we have a childrens park that use to be a cemetery and most bodies are still there
2
Ryland has the same eyes as his grandma
ive missed this shane :)
I love this so far 🥺 I’m so happy you’re back
I freaking missed you Shane
I feel like I would be a pissed spirit too if they decided just to take our gravestones out and build over it
Fat
The dangerous lick trend was annoying because our school took away our soap
tbh idc if you're "cancelled" I'm still gonna watch your videos and support you because you've grown
14:26 i love rylands dad 😭💗
Ps: you don’t need phone service to call 911, take it from a guy who went in the woods and call 911 thought it wouldn’t work
I love you Shane 😍❤️❤️
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6cM36Cm27U
We didn't forget about what you did Shane.
Way more murdering in Cali 💯
"I've missed you"  ME TOO BETCH 💖💖💖💖💖
Sell that trauma boys..lol
This made me miss Drew & Garret y’all what happened to them?!
About time Shane come back with conspiracy theory videos plz ❤️❣️💕💗
Keep making your videos Queen and I will keep watching I’m one of your biggest fans! Yes Queen! Love Vanessa and Tori
I am so happy to see you are making videos again definitely missed you used to watch you every single morning with my stepdaughter Tori. Hope you make a video on the park at night, can’t wait to see it if you do! This is Vanessa from Detroit Michigan
I'm so glad they all live in Colorado they all are so so so much happier Shane's decorating and doing all kinds of different things Morgan is so pretty and ryland is so happy I hope they never ever go back to Cali
Rylans childhood home is so cute omg
Everyone talking about scary stuff.  Morgan: did you know the annoying orange us back?  I started wheezing for some reason it was so funny in my brain
Shane Dawson is Lenny from Shark Tale.
Shame
From Colorado, 🙌🏼the 3 bridge is creep and scary i experience something else
Probably shouldn’t watch this before I fall asleep but 🤷🏼‍♀️
I've taken a pause while watching the video, to say that Morgan is just glowing.  Morgan's always been beautiful, but her beauty is emanating.  I really hope she know how beautiful she is - inside and out.  Her sense of humour is pretty epic too.
Please don't stop making videos again. Keep up your dream! We are here to support you.
I live is SW Rural Pennsylvania and one night at a friends house (they live on my road like 10 seconds awya form my house lol) we were sitting in her living room and we heard drums that sounded like bongos so we opened the front door and loud drums were playing the same beat over and over and it sounded like it was the house hidden in front of her house. So yeah
based, he is back
No but how did some kids just become so brain dead they start doing these dumb ‘trends’ generations really be getting dumber, so glad I’m not part of these kids generation Jesus
IM SO HAPPY YOU’RE BACK SHANE!!!!!! and you did NOT disappoint of course!
27:17 does moragn have horns on her shadow?
I am i the only person after watching one of he's videos calls a friend and tells her/him all about it so u know u aren't the only scared one
shane and rayland gives me Mitch and Cam vibe (from Morden Family)
I don’t know where this is going. But it sounds a lot more like a crazy serial killer is haunting the area than ghosts …
When she said she felt like kendall rae. I died!! Love kendall and love morgan. (Lookin beautiful as always!!)
"In the afterlife" Noooooo I dieddd 😂😂😂
Wow! Your Merchandise it’s gotten way expensive. Sorry I was in the truth I wish you have a drawing and give it away I’ll let you know different things. I wish I could afford it I can’t love you guys stay safe. Sending Hugs and healing  vibes✌️
I’m glad Shane started uploading again. I’ve been watching his videos for soooo long and it sucked when he stopped but I’m glad he’s back and doing good.
SHANE PLS MORE VIDOES I HAVENT HAD A GOOD TIME ON YOUTUBE W OUT YOU
MAKE THE CAMERA MAN STOP LAUGHING and BREATHING into the camera!!!!!!
I have a REAL ghost story... i have told it only a handful of times in my life but what I would give to be able to go back to the house it happened in!!!
Ryland’s dad 100% voted for trump
I feel like @shane missed a great opporunity to make a douseries of what its like being cancelled
Ugh, please stop propagating the noble savage myth.
Yeah, I mean most of our public green spaces have been cemeteries at some point across the years. There's limited space and there have been many lives here. The best we can do is respectfully pray for them and wish for the salvation of their souls.
LOVE YOU SHANE FROM COTE D'IVOIRE  🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮 HER  HARDWORK AND DEDICATION TO HELP OTHERS IS WHAT MISS WORLD NEEDS! SHE IS  MISS WORLD 2021!!!🇨🇮🇨🇮🌏🇨🇮🇨🇮  PEOPLE TAKE A GLANCE AND LEAVE AN IVORIAN FLAG TO SUPPORT OLIVIA YACE AT MRS WORLD 2021!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP6nNZif1Qs
https://youtu.be/K6cM36Cm27U Day 2 of posting the link to D'Angelo Wallace's video about Shane reminding y'all what he did.
Shane's filtering the comments, isn't he?
How is THIS okay???  https://youtu.be/LX4MXvb4TZI
Who’s the camera guy
I’ve seen demons, ghosts, spirit guides, and angels. They are real, they exist in the astral plane.
Wait he’s was cancelled why is now uploading I-
y’all are going to get eaten by a skin walker
I’m so happy my favorite person on here is back!!!!
still fuckin kids and saying the n word?
I’m a Colorado native and I’ve had an awful experience at third bridge that changed my life forever. Be careful if you ever go there again, my friends and I should have died that night, as It still haunts me to this day what happened.
Ayyy Kendal Rae ❤️
I KNEW IT I KNEW IT WAS THE BRIDGE OMFG OMFG THAT PLACE IS SHADY AS HELL IVE BEEN ONCE AND WANTED TO DIE SHANE OMFG
Re watching the series again...not gonna say how many times this makes. Anyway I was like wow its been so long since our queen posted anything...ITS ONLY BEEN A MONTH. WHAT KIND OF TIME PARADOX CRAP IS THAT
Post more scary videos
The drums heard when they’re at the place sounds like drums from Native American powwows. I always when to them when I was younger growing up with my family because I’m a Blackfoot Native American from the Blood Tribe in western Canada and those drums tripppped me out. Sounds like a powwow at night when it’s still going. Look up powwow drum songs and you’ll hear it.
While in Aurora, CO, they should have visited Century 21 where the movie theater shooting took place.
I miss the sitting in front of the camera 1 to 1 conspiracy theories with shane Dawson. Honestly, I'm not even gonna watch this.
When will yiu adress  the dramagedon you were involved in and the claimes you plotted to destroy another youtubers career ????
Why are there no negative comments
I love rylands family so freaking much
It’s the fact it’s mostly white people watching your vids, I seriously hope you see this comment Shane your disgusting absolutely disgusting I agreed you didn’t deserve as much hate as you were receiving but then you go and post again you don’t deserve a platform and you don’t deserve support.
Re cancel Shane for posting a series and abandoning us
So after all that happend you still watching this dude ? Lol
I love how comfortable you seem with Ryland's family! & I feel like the paranormal is SO your LANE 🔥 i honestly hate reality tv and I am very picky when it comes to paranormal content, but your new videos are what they both should be, COMBINED ! I live for the 'coming up next' experience! This could so be my new thing. Please keep uploading!! I liveeeeee
I’ve missed this🙉 conspiracy theory video needed
Cute family🥰 and so glad your back Shane,praying God's blessings on you.
this so funny watching as a latvian. bc out here we got cemetaries that are used as parks. like super old ones and bones sometimes arise but nobody puts on a panick. aaahahahah americans
morgan looks so much more confident, and as she should- shes literally stunning
We have all miss you more than you will ever know we love you Shane don't ever disappear again f*** them haters😋😋💙❤💜💚💛
Boooo
I’ve waited a year for this, thanks Shane you made my day
https://youtu.be/K6cM36Cm27U
Roland got this dads ugly looks.
so were the hate comments deleted or something
Someone please tell me the name of the movie with the car chase. I can’t remember what it’s called 💀
The balls he has to call this borning shit a 3 part docu-series. It’s a glorified vlog. And kinda boring with no direction. And nothing “spooky” about it.
That one dog is giving me life 😂😂 also Morgan is so pretty! She looks so grown up and happy and I’m jealous of how pretty she is!
I’m sorry but his sneak peaks at the end freak me out because the music makes it more scary 😂 love you Shane
Don’t care anything about haunting but I just have to say it’s absolutely unfathomable how badly this country treated native Americans for absolutely no reason
18:35 My SPN brain: WOMAN IN WHITE!?!? 28:39 YEP!
I'm sorry but the name 'Cheeseman' Park sounds like 'Chisme', Spanish for 'gossip' LMAOOOO
Wish they would not not put the words on the screen can't see it
Wish they would not not put the words on the screen can't see it
Wish they would not not put the words on the screen can't see it
Wish they would not not put the words on the screen can't see it
Wish they would not not put the words on the screen can't see it
i feel so damn smart for knowing about the sand creek massacre because of my history lessons 😌
the guy that licked his battery cracked me up
shane's clone looks too perfect.
Dude I had no idea you were making videos again. Good on ya man, cancel culture is bull crap and you don't have to stop living and doing what you love not just because of mistakes, but because some high and mighty got "offended" by it. As if they had no choice in the matter. Keep it coming man. Only the uneducated and those with the inability to think for themselves would have a problem with it.
What kind of dog was gpa holding?
No one gonna call out how Morgan read "aspiration" instead of "apparition."
Can Ryland just ditch 'Ryland' though..... I feel like it's time for him to be Ryan now that you're in CO full time and it's just kinda weird and he should be real
Yeah my bladder is going to explode. I can't go pee... I just rather like, have every limb covered in my blanket, yano? Especially since I've been followed too. I haven't seen a silhouette since I was like 10 but I did and I can feel it come and go.. There's one I DONT like once in a blue moon..that one I will end up a literal mummy in my bed. Not one movement. Like I'm dead for all they know bye now
Are y’all married? And if not do y’all have any plans to get married? Love y’all!
I absolutely LOVE Rylands family! They are the cutest!
I’m so glad you joined the many many many others who moved out of the west coast. It’s gotten really toxic over there recently
Shane out here claiming to be poor while I live in a 2 bedroom house with 6 people and holes in the walls.... Ts piss me off acknowledge your privilege and stop acting like your struggling
Still canceled to me 🤢🤮 this passive aggressive attitude is so annoying like this new generation who isn’t capable to cancel someone until the end He doesn’t care about you, he’s still getting money even if you aren’t there, he’s so hypocrite
Shane dropped this 👑
You can tell that Shane Dawson has the young impressionable fans because any real adult would look at this situation and see hey this guy's talked nasty about not only children but animals and there's something wrong here but lucky for him he has the young impressionable ones Shane you're a horrible person
Love your Video Shane! keep up the good work ! It is sooo fun to watch!
am I the only one who thinks Shanes begginings are scarier
sad thing is if one part of the body is moved and the other part isn’t the person can’t rest in peice
Sorry but person holding camera is distracting and annoying with his laughinh
Morgan just looks so stunning 🤩 😍
I love Bruce that energy is hilarious
Morgan looks so prettyy .
The fact y’all still supporting this man is absolutely disgusting. Be ashamed.
So he's going to be another graveyardgirl?
"devious lick"
So at my school we also did have kids doing that but I think the reason it was so bad at my school was because of the dress code. Before the whole trend our school was being sexist and inappropriate. There would be teachers entering the classrooms to check what you were wearing and even if you were wearing a jacket they would tell you to take it off and if you were wearing something you weren’t supposed they would send you in the office. They would even send male staff to check it wasn’t just female teachers. There is a rule that boys can’t have their pants sagging like to the point were their boxers are showing but never do anything to them. Someone made a petition and I don’t remember how many but there was around 1,200 signatures and the next day the principal made an announcement apologizing but it was more like “yea sorry but were not changing anything if you have a problem with it come talk to me about it” so in the end nothing just but after that NO ONE stands up to salute the flag and and of course kids started destroying bathrooms and so now we are not allowed to go to the bathroom 10 minutes after class starts and 10 minutes before class ends. And there are only 2 bathrooms opened, the cafeteria Beth rooms and the bathrooms in the first wing.
8:47 made me cackle
*Eerry music stops* *random dude licks a battery* "ugh its dead" * music starts again* *music stops* "LiKe ThE MaSsAcrE ViCtiMs 👹" 😂😂😂 18:26
WTF SHANE IS BACK YASSS BITCH!
SO glad that I saw this on Rylands channel!! Shane did the conspiracy series so well, and I'm hoping this will be as well. :)
16:51 dude one time I woke up from a dead sleep thinking someone was standing over me watching me I swear I saw some really tall dark figure standing there watching me and I told my parents the next day and they didn't believe me
So no one thinks that laughing about the cemetery-turned-park is insensitive. Those are peoples ancestors/ family members bodies and souls. Doesn't seem like a laughing matter to me
❌ DO NOT FORGET ❌
Am I the only one that hasn’t seen anything on TikTok about the bathrooms being destroyed? Like I’ve seen the damage but I’ve never seen videos on my TikTok of anyone damaging anything. Just me?
The guy with the trench coat and cowboy hat, my guardian looks like that slender build, very defined jaw, deep blue eyes, my native family also sees him rarely but have he comes around when I am going thru alot or something is going to happen  he protects me
Please leave YouTube, it is no place for bestiality and pedophilia.
i forgot abt this series😭
Ur back my breath is back
did yall forget what he did???
BYEEE Rylands parents are everything
not everyone simping for morgan in the comments
This series is pointless and don't feel sorry for him😒
This entire family is ❤️. Shane looks so happy and I couldn’t be happier for him.   Shane’s videos are freaking phenomenal! Glad you are back!!!!!!!
It’s the dog behind rylands dad looking at the camera like hell nah don’t do it 🤣🤣🤣
As an aboriginal women from Canada I accept that you’re did a series on Native Americans, the people that go there should respect the Native Americans spirits that are still lingering the area
We’ve missed you shane
YAAAS BITCH This is the content I've been waiting for!!!!!!!!!!!
Bruh the Homer dog killed meeeeeeeeee
I can see Shane's eyes watering when he tells Chris things follow me 🥺 I just wanted to give him the biggest hug 🤗 Coming from someone whose grandma lives in Salem Massachusetts I've seen a lot of crazy things and yes these videos are for entertainment but some people don't understand its different from seeing it on YouTube and being there in person. IT GETS REAL!!!
Missed u so much
Good you re back Shane.
I missed you and I’ve been wondering if you were ever coming back. I’m glad you’re back😊
missed you guys❤️
it’s sad how little views shane has now… he deserves more views bruh
You should collab with Kendall !
to say how much IVE MISSED YOU SHANE
Morgan looks gorgeous 💕
so glad you’re finally back
Yeah the government has been profiting off the energy of the dead for quite a while .
Will u do a video on your friends at Epstein's house?
Shane is back? Lets hope he doesn’t do the things he did before he was cancelled
Bahahhha not the devious licks
Why is his face blurred?
5:42 Ryland looks like he's about to shoot a mean fart at granny's face
i'm gay and this video made me homophobic
“Im just a big old white man who wants to show the creepy spookies ☺️😓”
Ryland's mom loves Chris. It's so sweet
Ryland’s dad IS A VIBE
Ughhh Boston terriers make me so happy
I'm from Colorado. Shane you should do a video on Como, the town in the mountains, by park city, I think. It's a local legend that Como, Colorado is inhabited completely by witches and anytime someone from Como comes into Denver they do something crazy, one guy shot a jeweler of a jewelry store in the head a few years ago. It's said Como is haunted and also inhabited by witches, it's a very creepy little town. You drive through it and the houses are painted really strange colors, you get a genuinely creepy vibe in Como, like a vibe you should leave quickly.
People really still watch this creep?
Did that guy just lick his battery ?
And you cant tell that there isnt at least one of these losers in this comment section (or at least watched this video), who think its cool to demolish school property.
Im dead when she described the cowboy ghost. There was one at my dads house i seen once. Creepy af
So happy you're back Shane missed yall so much and it seems so much better for yall where you're at now congratulations yall
take accountability again
the cameraman needs to stop laughing so much 🙄
Love that I live in Aurora co 😂 I’ve met rylands family while out at dinner and they’re so genuinely nice Morgan sat and talked with me love them all
YOU GET A VANDALISM CHARGE! AND YOU GET A VANDALISM CHARGE! EVERYONE GETS A V-A-N-D-A-L-I-S-M C-H-A-R-G-E! disrespectful little shits.... (the bathroom destroying kids)
Can you mute the camera guys laugh.... 😐
Was I just not aware wdf
So he is back..
interesting how the dislikes are now hidden 🙄🙄
Rylands family is exactly like my family. Dad hates california is super funny but an oddball, mom is tiny and always tries to be polite but is secretly hilarious as fuck, and grandma cant hear but pretends to and then comes out with a comeback fit for the times
morgan love of my life
31:50 was so cringy.
Okay Morgan!! Bodyodyodyody!! 😍
1:04 Aspiration? Um did she mean apparition LMAOOOO
He’s back🌝
Only here for Morgan
I’m all for happiness and laughter but damn they laugh way too much. So much that it’s a little annoying.
But how do you know for certain the man’s wife and two kids weren’t killed and scalped by the Natives? Did you witness it personally? Not saying it justifies killing the entire tribe but some of the tribe members may have been responsible.
I can't believe everyone is just gonna accept Shane not apologizing and taking accountability for what he's done..
This SERIES IS SO GOOD I MISSED THEM
I live on cheesman park and the stories of the woman with the severed head were told about my house! I've lived their for 15 years and have always been told stories of the headless woman who supposedly sits on the dining room table, but I have yet to see her.
S h a n e. Is. S c a r y
Part 4: Theory Theories with Shane Dawson
Anyone know the background music @ 22:39 ??
Stop making fun of grandma 😡
Rylands dad💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂
Did you guys forgive him already
@13:44 The woman saying the most important bodies were removed first and all that's left are "bad people" - so anyone that's poor is bad now lol?
Okay we're ready for another video
Dude break a leg
Ry's dad is a whole ass mood 🤣🤣🤣 reminds me of my dad ❤❤ (RIP)
MORGAN UR GOING TO MAKE ME STRAIGHT 😮‍💨🙏
27:20. yes.
Don’t do black face no more
This is so disrespectful to the Natives that were massacred..
Yeah steal more content that you didn’t make Shane
Reminds me of wallahalla road
I’m confused. Didn’t Morgan buy her own home in Colorado? Why is she living back at her parents?
Your movie not cool is the worst thing ive seen in my life. Its up there with two girls one cup
I had a feeling this was going to be about Third Bridge. Growing up around there…been there a few times and I’ll never go back. Wish I never went to begin with honestly. My heart sunk when Morgan said Third Bridge for the first time.
We missed you too Shane. We all know you are a sweetheart that just made some immature mistakes. We forgive you and are glad you are back. Haters gonna hate and the players gonna play but baby you just gonna shake shake shake.
when my mom was in her 20s she lived around cheesman park one night on a run around there it started to rain so she ran home. she saw a little girl sitting there crying on a bench unbothered by the rain. she wasnt wet either. while living there in her basement she has a crawlspace. knowing now those houses are extremely haunted (my family still lives here) she relized what the fuck happened. in her crawlspace she found ripped up baby doll heads fresh blood and stuffing. she was rlly young when these things happened so she didnt have a clue. but to this day i think that little girl is in our current house in littleton. put this in a video if you want to i love your videos!
so glad you’re back🥳
Rylands Grandma: "im so happy hes going to be doing this" *me tearing up...* Shane: " I hope i dont die.."  Rylands Grandma: "..yeah :D " *me gimping out*
We didn’t forgot that you hurt children and animals
To go on a ghost hunt with Shane, ryland and Morgan would be awesome!!!! The stories I heard from when my mom & dad lived in Denver, it would be a blast!!
Morgan: “an aspiration”  Apparition…. 🥲
Yessir OmarGoshTV
We’ve missed you too shane
I saw jaclyn Glenn’s hate video on you on my feed so instead I searched up your name and am watching you
his scary / conspiracy videos are my safe videos
I should not have laughed when morgan asked if grandma was going with them and rylands response was "she wouldnt hear them coming"
Please, please, please do a video with the Ghoul Boys that would be so awesome.
Welcome back to YouTube shane
Eye spy a party city unicorn piñata lol  😂
mans took a year to start posting again yoy don’t understand how many times i went to your acc just to see if you posted
Ew
grandma carried
THE ENDINGGGG HAHAHA OK BRUCE
Sucks 🐔🍭
I’m telling you, you should to go to saint albans in Virginia, it has lots of real history and it’s over 100 years old. It has cry sad and scary history. I think you’d like it
I wish This was actually real. But ofcourse this is for views. I missed shane so much! I've been there since the beginning.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCgzmRoPglu5WJj8PXoUoYAA
Its really gross he came back in my opinion
Morgan is so pretty and she is GLOWING. I don’t think she knows just how beautiful she is. STUNNING. I missed you guys so much
Honestly though with the devious licks bullshit was ridiculous in my school. It's still happening too. Our bathrooms were shut down and as soon as they were opened again, stupid kids would do something else to them, like hotbox the bathrooms, snort cocaine, vape circles, etc. I am so fucking sick of kids being idiots and not having any respect for anything.
https://youtu.be/WWgkk2uSq5o
https://youtu.be/2Yo4oGJF9RA
Lame...
Eventually everywhere will have bodies under it
https://youtu.be/9SqX5Hp44Do
OMG!!!! SHANE IS BACK!!! IM SOO HAPPY!!!!!
imagine profiting off of the colonization and genocide
shane!! I loved this one !! Can you please do another conspiracy theories vid I'm a huge fan of those!!
I love morgan sm
This series is much better if you have been drinking a bit.
Ummm....girl that is not just a spirit that looks like a cowboy 17:00 that is the devil!! He wears a black top hat and a long black trench coat normally when he appears. Other times he when he appears he can be whatever he wants. Like a baby, dog, angel whatever.
Hi Shane my soft toy monkeys Harry and Larry send their love xo penny p.s. hate that u got so persecuted before. People still go on. Love u lots. Give my love to Ryland
7:15 lmao "right on his dick"🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Ryland's dad. He hates California and TikTok YAS
Morgan looks AMAZING
Okay admit it you missed Shane on YouTube I mean come on now he funny and entertaining and there is nothing like his editing you have to admit his editing and series like no other we can forgive him and move on with our lives and let he said stop “staying in the past” and stay in the present right now and excited for his future content.
I live in CO and went to third bridge at 3am with  some friends. we sat in complete silence, in his car, with the windows rolled down, and nothing but static from the radio playing. This was the first time I had ever experienced anything paranormal and it didn’t necessarily scare me but more or so gave me an overwhelming sense of pride to where I started crying (I heard loud drumming and traditional dance chanting)  because I am Native American and I felt what my ancestors felt with what took place on that plot of land. I was the only one who heard the drumming and singing but it was clear as day as if it was just outside the car window.
I just absolutely adore Ryland's family.
not them talking about devious licks.. dead
Please go away again everything was so peaceful on the internet without you. And being disrespectful to towards native Americans isn't a good start :)
OMG! Shane you look amazing! Getting the hell out of California has done a world of good for all 3 of you? Love all of you 💕
YAY CONSPIRCIE THEORIES
I’m loving this because I live in Colorado!!! Been there once, definitely eerie
Morgan is a downer compared to how she used to be..
missed u, shane 🥺
Lmao that little Frenchie has some serious psycho eyes 😳
Kitten.
Finally
Who is the goth girl with the orange t shirt
Let’s all go look at Shane’s DailyBooth 😎
the “grab a snack” part made me want to eat for the first time in a few days
❤️🌿
So happy Shane’s back but can we talk about how pretty Morgan is
*How to make bad content and be a bad person at the same time.*   Get this!!! There’s already someone like that, his name is Shane Dawson!!
I guess people always wanna support toxic people that have shown they don't want to improve. :/
Everybody In your last video going "WoW eVeRyOnE iS dOiNg A 180" No dude, I never left. And it only seems that way, because I didn't make an hour long video saying all the reasons I DIDN'T care that shane got "canceled"
this is my safe place
How the fuck does this have likes
Just here for Morgan. Not shane
Lmaaooo “I’m just a big old white man and wanna show the ~spookies~
morgan is STUNNING
OMG YOUR BACK YASSS I NEEDED THIS VIDEO
YEY MORE THEORIES!
As a teacher in a neighboring school district to the father I DONT blame him. I often say thank god I don’t teach in Alief. A friend of mine was spat on by a student in Alief recently
20:45 ah yes the implication
Obsessed with Shane and Ryland love. I want to know more about the history of Morgans HOUSE
I mean anyone else look at Shane Dawson and be like damn, the garbage pail kids do exist?
Morgan yr coowl as Shiet girl. Hey Shane.
the girl"The ghost is very much like a cowboy" the video*shows cowboy shadow* me: "Is that just a photoshopped version of Jimmy Dean??" HAHAHAHSHHFDSXYGUSDYKI
Omg Morgan is amazing I love her series that you made on her ghost friend who followed her home and now they're friends and they still check up on her.
I love rylands dad
Morgan, you look really good and happy!!! i never comment on videos, but i thought id say. you are looking awesome! ;)
He posted I've been waiting for this moment
Chris: I hope I don't die Grandma: yeah..
The devious licks 😂
Morgan u Are BEAUUTIFUUUUL
"Whatever you put in the internet, stays in the internet" sh!t, even pictures I deleted of myself ugly. fvck
How nice of you to at least show the names of the Youtube channels you stole all this content from, instead of just adding them to the description box that almost no one reads.
i just found out he’s back on youtube and IM SO HAPPY. literally used to binge watch shane when i felt so lonely and lost, he made me happy and feel like i wasn’t alone. Every human makes mistakes , life goes on. shane deserves to do what he loves , bc although there’s always going to be people who hate and shit talk.. believe it or not he makes so many people happy i would know .. AHH YAY 🤍
I love you Shane so happy you’re back
yall are so musty and gross
words cannot describe how happy i am to have u back
I’m sorry but the dog sitting on the couch looking back and fourth during the conversation killed me 🤣🤣🤣💀
just here to drop my dislike and go
Worth every minute 👏🏼
okay but my friend goes to wayne high school, and they took an entire freaking toilet. like the whole thing and no one knows who or how
Great to see that you're back, also great to see all of the nice comments. You do you.
Washington Square Park in NYC is a similar story
using indigenous peoples' murders as entertainment for your overwhelmingly white american audience
🤦🏽🤦🏽 I just can't with these stupid comments they make.
When any of these white people say they heard a native drummer, like omg. I couldn't hear shit and their attempts vocalize what they hear aren't war drums.. it's so fucking stupid.
Bro when he said ion be on tiktok and like when he said Travis Scott 😦 like or his tickets
"OH YUMMY" HAD ME DEAD LMFAO but let's talk about HOW GORGEOUS MORGAN AND HER MOM ARE! LIKE WOAHHHHHHHHHHHH
I doubt shane will see this but i havent gotten any notifications for any of these and im highkey pissed utube algorithm is just a buss
A Kendall Rae and Shane collab would be AMAZINGGGGG!!!
So I see everybody just magically forgot about the fucked up shit this dude did huh
"When they're scared they're more likely to make out with you" - I'm sorry but what the fuck :D ?!
You shouldn’t have come back
27:49  *i mean i cant, this like what*  eugh 😩
why is nathan hungate's face blurred ? xd
Morgan is just so pretty.
Credit people whose contents you just glued in here man. How old are you at this point
Wow loving the new content❤️❤️❤️❤️
I haven’t laughed this much in a long time! Thank you for making videos again❤️
Ugh. Racism and bigotry yet again. Not surprised.
Ryland's dad is adorable 🥺
I saw Shane said he got a lot of positive comments he wasn't expecting, so I came here to do my part and say this: bruh, you do not deserve a platform <3
I am so genuinely happy you have posted again. It's been way too long since I've heard all of your contagious laughs!
shane shows his friends and family just having a conversation. no other youtubers do that and if they did i bet they'd be so popular. it makes me feel part of the family a bit. i wish there were more like this.
These comments are kinda scary. Seeing people say they missed shane and glad he's back just doesn't make me feel right, I need a glass of water.
Return of the king
Why are all the comments about how gorgeous Morgan is its true but I think that's what this video is about 😄 and I'm happy Shane's back and I would also like to point out this is like my third time watching it fully
Yay welcome back Shane
Shane is so pick me🙄
glad you are back finally!
Absalutly love your family shane im so releived to see morgan thriving <3
Shane is getting haunted by Django… jk
Uh oh hes back... parents hide your children
Yay I miss your theories videos Shane!
SEXOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
morgan is so fucking pretty omggggggg
The people "happy" about this return are absolute trash. Youtube just loves embracing r**ists and pe**philes, doesn't it?
ryland's grandma is adorable
proof that cancel culture doesnt exist for white ppl
They all seem so much happier I’m so happy for them
okay but when he said 1864 i instantly thought of vampire diaries
Ryland's dad seems like a literal sweetheart!!!
You guys look great! I have missed your videos Shane! Glad you are back
I love that clips of omargoshtv was included in this!
I'm so glad you found the courage to post again. I'm sorry you've had the world turn against you for past mistakes. That lonely feeling is intense and stressful. I know 😔  Love the haunted series theme! Can't wait for the rest! P.s don't take the clot shot!... now that's a "conspiracy" you  HAVE to delve deep into and when I mean deep it goes fkn crazy far to the point of no return and mind blowing facts that make you question reality as it is..... enjoy! 😳😬 xo
Shane is loved by so many - I’m so happy for him…..love ya Shane and you’re whole clan!
Morgan is a good storyteller. She should start making more of that content.
So you're gonna come back like nothing happened?
Shayne so glad to see another series. You need to do more vidoes people love you.
Okay hear me out… Sam and Colby & Shane collab🤯🤯🤯
Morgan is looking gorgeous these days! Glad to see you making content again Shane! I will always be a big fan. ❤
Welcome back Shane, you still have alot of people that loves you and that will never goes away. Awesome video loves it
Ok, I love Ryland's Dad, he's awesome
Shane, I know you'll probably never see this but you and your videos mean the world to me. I've watched you since your very first video and I've been through so much depression and stuff similar to you. I've seen every video you've ever made and I'll always be a fan. Words can't describe how grateful I am to you thank you for always making me laugh, no matter how hard times are
Keep it coming. Enjoying very much
Morgan is so pretyy
Stop putting yourself down Shane. You are human and a good one at that! People’s opinions are just that.. opinions.. love the creator you are and your vulnerability💛
My friend at her school someone steal 27 toilets and 13 soap dispensers
I'm so glad you are back to YouTube. I missed you so much Shane  <3 <3
Dude I didn't know Shane was back on yt yet, 😭
My school had a toilet stolen from it. We had all bathrooms except one closed. Only the good kids who teachers trusted really got to use the bathroom at all
Shawn I know your probably not even going to ignoledge this comment but I just want to say a couple things to you. One I wanted to thank you for all the things you did for me. When I was getting bullied in my younger grades (6th grade) for being overweight I watched you everyday to make myself feel better. I was cutting myself, My self esteem was at rock bottom, I was thinking about suicide but you made me laugh and even when I would cry myself to sleep I still remembered the video I watched the next day. Two thank you for making me feel more comfortable with my sexuality ( I’m bisexual) that’s also another thing I got bullied for and judged and even lost a couple friends over. The only thing at that time that was keeping me afloat was thinking about watching your videos when I got home from school. My family judged me, all the kids in my class (except one or two people) judged me, I judged myself but you made me so happy I forgot about all the bad stuff in my life and focused on the video. Even if you never see this comment I want you to know I appreciate you very much and thank you for all the enjoyment over the years! ❤️
Welcome back.
Welcome back!!! Chin up, chest out, purse on, GO!  We've missed your spin on things. The whole family is great!  You are loved ....... xxo
I am SO happy you're back Shane.
Why is Morgan absolutely stunning!
Really hoping you're here to stay Mr. Shane 🥳
I’m so glad you’re back !!! I look forward to everything you will bring to us. You’re amazing and talented and today is the first day of the rest of your life !!!
shane youre an Icon in the youtube community.  everyone has a past, everyone has made mistakes but it doesnt mean it should effect what you decide to do in the future.  BE YOU.  thank you for coming back.
I'm soooo ecstatic to see everyone in this video on my favorite topic❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I hope this can continue. Shane, Ryland, and Morgan look so fantastic and at peace at home! I think Cali was a little too self centered for these selfless people ❤️❤️❤️❤️ can't wait to see more content!!
I'm so happy you're back Shane your creativity to make good quality fun spooky interesting content is everything you're loved you've been deeply missed nothing but love to you and your amazing family. Can't wait for part 2 and 3!! Congrats my dude
Love that Shane is back. Love you Shane!!
Welcome back I have missed your videos!
I miss the content and I love you guys!
❤️ So glad you’re back!!
How is this not exploiting indigenous struggles ? You also act as if you were canceled over nothing and like it’s no big deal. ….
Happy your back to posting! I like both of your videos ♥️ and Morgan’s the best 🙌
Rylands dad is HILARIOUS lmaoo
I’ve missed you so much Shane 😭
Anyone taking part in destructive "trends" like that one are actually committing crimes so why haven't they already started jailing these people?
Morgans the busty wife I need ❤️
Lol lots of john Walsh stories on his show happened somewhere in Colorado
I missed shane so much
i<3u
#stillcancelled
Come live in the UK everything has graves under it! They just moved thousands of victorian body's in London to put a new tube station  in 🤷‍♀️
the internet just felt weird without shane.
I missed you, i hope you and your family is amazing! Bring on Shane! <3 u! -Jill M.
my ancestors are natives . my family . i find it beautiful that people can hear their drums at night
I was expecting more views
Morgan looks so much happier. We love to see it 😌
Talk about a comeback lol.
Shanes sad expression about knowing the extent of colorado murders
IM HAPPY SHANE IS BACKKKK YESSS!!
All you guys are glowing ❤️love to see you all happy . Shane i have missed you ❤️❤️
shane back
Does Ryland realize how predatory/rapey he sounds.? “We would take girls there to make them scared and make out with us” 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
Morgan is so gorgeous I cant
Missed you guys so much ❤️
Fupa trooper 4 life
I need more of these videos. I just keep watching Shane’s Haunting videos over again! 😃
Clearly Colorado has never heard of Boston Common
My theory is that he has no one to prey on so he comes back to continue the behavior he has never change over the 15 years.
These same kids that are destroying public property and vandalizing places are the same idiots who are part of the cancel culture. I would guarantee it. They are all so toxic and only care about bragging and clout. Hope they get thrown in juvie
Get that smell from your car checked out.
Happy you're back Shane, misses you!
Ryland looks just like his grandma omg
7:25 is by far one of the funniest things in this video
The dad talking about devious licks 😭😭😭
Thank god for grandma.
The kids demolishing bathrooms is most likely the boys. It happened to the school that I go to. And even in high school.
they dont know about those public schools
I'M SORRY, but Morgan is SO PRETTY WTH
“Oh it’s dead…. Like the massacre victims”
Rylands dad is such a gem
I’ve gone there and I heard drums but nothing else
Can you guys please hire psychic and go to a haunted place. It would be such a interesting video
no
p3d0
What is the movie at 20:58?
Morgan looks very different to me. DONT HATE ON ME - I’m not shitting on her. I actually feel wrong saying how beautiful She looks because I don’t want others thinking I never thought that was the case before. If she didn’t anything to herself to IMPROVE her beauty, then good - whatever makes her feel as beautiful as she is! However, I just really hope it’s not due to hearing the need to improve her looks from other plastic influencers like she did over, and over, and over in the Shane/Jeffrey series. If she did this because it’s truly what she wanted to do and felt bus doing, then she is doing great! But I just hope she did not force her self to do some thing that other girls would not stop forcing her into doing. Either way she looks great, and that is a huge compliment considering, I thought she could not look any better! XO
1:04 “aspiration” I think what you was meant to say was “Apparition”
Ryland's Dad is cool af. I like the way hs thinks!! 👌🏻👏🏻
This was cool and amazing, keep up the awesome and amazing work
Morgan is total girl crush ❤️
children in these comments don't know that he did weird things with kids and pets this is sad and gross
So y'all really just praise pedophiles?
“Oh yummy”
5:20 not the devious licks😂
Rylands dad is a whole vibe! 🖤🖤🖤
20:33 Kendall hates Shane just as much as I do. She is gonna be pissed. The only reason I'm watching is because I'm curious about how Shane would try to give himself the redemption arc he doesn't deserve.
Ugh wasn’t Shane cancelled?
A place you want to go to but I don’t think is haunted is the abandoned missile silo’s very eerie but definitely an adventure and fun to explore
As someone who has lived in Colorado their whole life third bridge is not haunted the drums you hear are from a nearby oil rig. I’ve gone to third bridge many many times even spent the whole night under the bridge several times.
you should collab with sam and colby
The edit is just over the top 🙁
Can rylands dad just make a channel i’ll be there
I'm glad Shanes back 😁 I've missed him so much 😪 lots of love from the UK ❤
Watching the series for like the 6th time!!!! I’ve missed Shane so much.
please explore cheesman park soon!!! i have been there and its f*ck*ng crazy!!
This is a bit Logan Paul esque lol
Awe Rylan dad is amazing!  Glad to see ya back shane.
These aren’t ghosts. They are demonic spirits posing as spirits to deceive us. They are not to be engaged with or sought out. Please be careful yall. This stuff is no joke! God doesn’t leave any spirit to roam the earth. It’s much more complex and dangerous than that. Spirits, yes, but not a person who has departed.
Jesus. We all need Jesus.
FINALLY!!!  we have all made jokes in our youth that wasn’t alright but we learned from it, and grew better. The only difference is your youth is on the internet for everyone to pick apart and analyse and twist in to things !  You seem so happy 😁 glad to see you back ❤️
Yesss pls do another video with Kendall I love her
Happy 2 year anniversary of the conspiracy pallete! Merry Christmas
Why am I in love with Morgan? 😅
WHEN DOES THE SCARY SHIT START THIS MAD BORING SHANE
This was cool and awesome, keep up the awesome and amazing work
Mommy…??? Sorry Morgan…sorry mommy…?????
Awww baby Morgan in 2018🥺
Love you forever Shane
Cemeteries are literally a waste of space; literally just a way for people to profit on others emotions. Don’t be surprised in the future when cemeteries will be a thing of the past. Literally every house ever is built on dead bodies.
Ryland you legit look like your grandma 😍😍😍
😏😊
Literally tearing up bc I missed Shane, Ryland, and Morgan so much
I swear this is so perfect because I was watching Sam&Colby because they were uploading a load due to Halloween
shane has saved 2021
I claim no negative energy emitted from this video.
He’s back
You look a bit buzzed Shane  PP PASS
He back
Really MISSED you Shane!! ❤️
I live for rylands dad omg lol
Rylands dad is suuuch a vibe lmao
Why is the Daniel dudes face blurry but not the others? Just curious to know hahaha
When the world needed him most he returned
Since everyone moved to Colorado they all just seem genuinely happy and are thriving 💜 I love it.
I need this sound effect at the beginning! Please heeelp! 😊
What’s the girls channels name @ 21:19  I can’t find it anywhere in the description
Why are laughing at genocide and colonialism? There's nothing humorous about the near extinction of those tribes. And you tell the story like it's some fairytale, as if those people don't exist today and STILL suffer from the effects of mass genocide.   Also, I'm so tired of Natives being used as spooky ghost plot devices. It's so cliche and disrespectful. Speaking of which, if you don't know about the topic you're trying to discuss (ESPECIALLY a serious one like this), then why even bother covering it without proper research?  Typical white ignorance. Exploiting marginalized people for clout, views, and a quick buck.
So crazy how they was checking out the flowers as they was walking in reminded me about the move scream when parent was walking in at the first part of the movie.
174k winners vs 14k losers. We love Shane.
Chris needs to make shirts that say “I’m sweaty”. I’d buy the shit out of those 😂
Ok so i dont rly believe in a lot of this shit but i live in co and went to third bridge w me friend in hs and i swear on my life you could hear the drums and it just kept getting louder and louder and I finally lost it and was like we need to leave now. It was eerie as fuck.
I'm so happy you're back. I missed you so much Shane. Luv u! Squeee!!! XOXOXO
So, so  happy to see you again Shane!   Mama Hartman💜
Ok but he should do a collab with sam and colby-
Lmfao Rylands dad is cracking me up in this
I’m watching this on Halloween eve 😳
I’m bdK
omg i missed you so fucking much
i fucking love you
Welp, I’m never going to Colorado
the fact that you can actually hear the drums is crazy
Waiting for next video like , 🙃🙃 ⏰ ⏰
Do you mean apparition instead of aspiration Morgan?
‘She wouldn’t hear the beat of the drum’ 💀😂
I feel like I can’t enjoy his videos the same amount I used to anymore after everything. He used to be my idol, now I don’t know what to think.
As someone who grew up in Denver and played at Cheesman at night all the time, I have never heard of any of this haha that park isn't scary at all
32:16
“That gave me the worst chills Shane, the part w the quote in red!” Like I’ve been judged for watching u, and have been a fan, but this one was the scariest
This story doesn't sit right with me...  like i usually don't get scared of anything but this is like REAL to me, good job Shane you generally scared the sh!t outta me with this series :).
Hey
So glad your back shane i watch all your videos.. oh and fuck the haters buddy your amazing
Music is scary(!!!¡¡!!¡!!!!!!¡¡¡¡!!!!!!!!!!!!) Say in scary way
I can't be the only one who thinks morgan looks STUNNING and AMAZING just wow so  pretty.
i miss enjoying these videos without knowing those things.. i hope you've changed.. not sure about the whole story though so if anyone knows of recent things lmk if not then i hope you're better now and i hope to keep seeing you grow
Love you forever!
Ugh why is it you that came back not Jenna Marbles…
It’s sad to see Morgan before and after clips 16:00  - and now- she did her lips and cheeks. After living in Los Angeles I’m sure she felt she needed the surgery to fit in with the fake lips trend.
Omar ❤️
sorry but bad video
Ghost hunting is boring. Welcome to the Paranormal community.
This series is one of my favorites you have done so far just because I recently moved to Colorado as well and so being so close to all of this makes it way more interesting to watch!
Morgan is so beautiful I can't even..
watching this is terrifying! growing up we had the “hat man” in our house. he only showed up when there was violence. my sister was probably 13 and i was 1 and she said her door would be cracked and he would just stand there. she thought it was my mom playing a joke so she would shout, “mom?” my mom would usually come in and calm her down. she said she woke up again and he was at the end of the bed. she then went on to say later that week she over heard my mom on the phone talking about the same guy & my mom sees him at the bed of the hallway in front of my sisters door. luckily we left soon after.
Grandma needs a hearing aid! I think it would really help her keep up with the conversations. My mum might need one soon as well <3
Keep deleting comments, it won’t make you any less of a predator.
I really pray that you guys brought protection with you for your safety
SHANES BACK OMFGGGG
I feel like Rylands mom is low key toxic to Morgan 🤔
If I am not as pretty as grandma when I am her age… hahaha! I love her!!!!!!! You can just seei her beautiful aura
HE IS BACK BABYYYYYY SO HAPPY !
Pretty sure that David Dobrik is the new camera guy.
Shane: “We’re gonna die.” Rylands Grandma: “yeah…” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LMFAO
the fucking queen is back
And people think Florida is fucked lol
Omg since y’all like Kendall Rae and live in the same state be a guest on her podcast the sesh 🥰💕 it’s the content we need
I can’t even watch his videos anymore man
shane is fucking back yes.
i was literally thinking "morgan must watch kendall rae she sounds just like her. and then se LITERALLY SAID "I sound like kendall rae right now" and my mind was blown
So fricken glad your finally back!! No one does these videos like you I swear. So happy to see you uploading again and hope your here to stay!
I don’t care what anyone says I’ll always love and support Shane and ryland
I missed the bathroom destroying TikTok. Glad it wasn't in my algorithm. 😲
living in colorado, i’ve learned that supposedly the altitude messes with peoples head
This video would of been better without ryland
you are a disgrace, you came back bc you thought people would “forget” about you but they didn’t. you are a danger to society i hope you get put in jail for ur crimes
Make a horror movie
Love the Kendall shout out. I would die at a Morgan/Shane/Ryland/Kendall collab
I think i heard a drumbeat. Sets of 3
thank you for coming back Shane. I missed u.
I won't forget what you did, you can delete comments... but you know you shouldn't be back.  You ARE a danger to society.
Who tf is behind the camera all I here is wheezing and yes man laughing
Okay am I the only one that's pumped he showed O'Donnell Middle school in Alief? Lol Houston Alief Texas in the house!!!!!!
I've lived in Colorado all my life and never knew about Cheesman Park. So thank you Shane for sharing that information. i found it interesting
now we just need jenna to come back:(
This was so boring
I MISSED MY WEEKLY DOSE OF SHANE SO MICH
is it me but can you guys hear a ghostly "hi" 2:50 - 2:57
Hi shane! Thank you for coming back! Could you please in the next videos put the music down a little i could barely hear  the people speaking
Lol my dad took me to cheesman park all the time when I was a kid and he told me he had no idea
MORGANNN YOU ARE SO PRETTY MY GAWD
Missed u bro
I am glad that you and Jeffree left California, Ryan’s dad is right. It is very toxic, & it does suck the positive energy right out of you. I can’t wait to see you two together again 💕
You guys should really come out to Illinois because the elementary school I would have soccer practice at used to be a cemetery. Rumor has it that a lot of the bodies are still there. Just being there you can feel the presence of the spirits.
OMGGG GAY IS BACKKKCKC
Ryland's dad gives me life. Can I move in with them 🤣
You're back!!!!! I am so happy.
this isn’t markiplier 👎👎👎👎 unsubbed
I’m just gonna leave this one here. https://youtu.be/dCGhDym0LDA I get it, you enjoy his content, I did too, but y’all really need to stop smoking whatever the ”i pretend to not see”  crack y’all are taking. Please :(
So glad he’s back 🥰
Nobody cares about schools destroy them all
I love u Shane. Thank you for posting
Could someone do me a favour n let me know what movie this is?? 26:52
I missed this so much omg
"I hope i don't die" "Yea" ngksjfh
Lol rylands dad is truly everyone’s dad in a nutshell. He repeated what he was saying multiple times like it was new info 😂💀
Ok but dad has all the juice 😭🤣🤣🤣
Grandma is the best character
I went to Old cemetery in my town and seen a little girl in a white dress walking behind me in the cemetery in a white baptism dress later found out the first person buried in the cemetery where is my great great great great aunt  who told her sister the day I die tell mom and daddy bury me underneath this big oak tree she died the same night and they buried her under the oak tree do not know the story before she was buried in a white dress went back again and two boys seem the same thing I seen and I did not tell anyone about it
i’m glad my internet dad came back from the grocery store
this is scary
Morgan is such a comforting and beautiful person. She’s the type of person I’d feel safe hugging honestly
Jesus fucking Christ. How about we don't give a location to the masses where people set up kidnappings constantly... Ghost hunting aside, that place is fucked over by dodgy humans.... Don't go there! It's not worth the investigation. I used to frequent there with my paranormal group, we barely got out a few times. I'm really disappointed Shane didn't do his fucking research and gave the name and location. You could have left the name and location out of it. Giving a silly little warning won't do shit. That place is dangerous, act like it. Please don't go there to anyone who is contemplating it. They didn't do a good job of explaining just how dangerous it can be.
The music is way louder than last time lol. I had to turn on subtitles.
Really boring. Ryland is literally so annoying.
Holy shit! I never thought Shane would post!
i miss garett
Should collab with Bailey Sarian! She could do the back stories of places, and you could investigate. 😳🙏
morgan gives off such good vibes like honestly
i get the spooky vibes but Mr Shane i am scared af
Yuck
It's Mexican music banda playing  lolhttps://youtu.be/Kr0Ev1mfeMg
Comment section passed the vibe check. I'm so glad to see you happy again. All of you.
32:35 LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m a school counselor… the bathroom thing is real. Now we have to monitor all bathroom usage and examine the bathroom after someone uses it. Ridiculous waste of my day.
Alright, i wanna move to Colorado
yeah this is just incredibly disrespectful, you guys are talking about a mass genocide while giggling.. giggling about it? im genuinely stumped as to why people want this swine of a man back and further more how stupidly intact the like dislike ratio is. you guys switched up so fast its sad
Watching this and my first ad is about a game with a ghost girl 😐😐😐
can we all just take a moment and talk about morgan’s glow up like😍😍😦
lol it's so obvious Shane has no idea how to discuss racism & genocide in any capacity... bro this whole thing is just a mess and you know what it's missing? EMPATHY.  **i'M aN EmPaTh**
So glad to see shane back doing videos.💖  please dont stop
The creepy spokes killed me 😂
I hate to admit it but I missed him, it may take a while to completely forgive him for what he did in the past but I belive people can change and he genuinely seems like he's trying, even tho he's a famous youtuber he's still a person at the end of the day and people make mistakes
y’all should really come to savannah georgia. i go to college here and it’s considered one of americas most haunted cities. they even offer ghost tours here at night. some say that workers can’t even dig in some places since a lot of the city is built over burial grounds such as the historic district and even some houses specifically!
ryland's dad is such a freaking mood about everything especially with the country songs about electric cars BAHAHAHAAH
So glad to see you posting again !
I mean that lick tho🥶
MORGAN LOOKS SO GOOD WOW
Bring back conspiracy theories man they were so good
Can someone explain the video of the girl saying there is in fact an all black spirit linked to someone...is that Shane's  haunting ?
grandma is literally the sweetest person alive she needs to be protected by all costs❤️
morgan is beautiful. <3
Why did I choose to watch this at night?
IVE MISSED U
uh oh morgan is going to be posting in the entitled parents subreddit bout her mom busting into the room while knocking.
Ok but shanes new intro is actually creepy asf but i love it so much
I don’t feel like Morgan gracing us with her presence was 2018?! It doesn’t seem like that long! She’s grown so much & seems so happy.
24:05
AWESOME To have you back! Videos are GREAT! PS I messaged Tiffany from BB23 and told her to contact you. I thought maybe you could have her in one of your videos! She is all up for it and thanked me. I am not sure she is a follower yet but I raved about you and your love of BB. I also told her you are a You Tube ICON and if she wants to be anybody she has to get her foot in with you;)
YASS
Whatever you put on social media stays there forever. Obviously this woman dosent know you can delete things on social media lol. 😂
Shane's has the best conspiracy show on youtube
DEVIOUS LICK!!!
Shane is the perfect fit for the family. I love this!
Please!!!!!!!! I'm begging you!!!!!!!! Come see Southern Colorado its beautiful, its moderately haunted (depending on where you go) and there's less of all that other "bad stuff", the worst we had recently was someone given a ticket for lighting fireworks
LMAOOOO DEVIOUS LICKS HAHAHAHA
STOPPPP, You do the best theory videos OMGGGG.
Good to have you back! We have missed you too!!🤍💛🧡
They tried so hard to make this seem interesting and scary
Morgan looks amazing
the cowboy spirit, i have had dreams that have involved a black figure with a pointy hat try to get me since i was little. when he started talking about that i lost my shit
Rylands dad is my spirit animal😂😂
love you Shane so happy you are back and happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5kNCpe-yyY
This is going to be mean. But Shane looks like a marshmallow that got microwaved and slowly deflated…
“I’ll save you Chris🥰!” - Vicki 😂😂
Not the devous licks xD
man: [licks battery] ugh, its dead... like the massacre victims
My boyfriend and i were gonna go there one night and as i was looking up the location the radio in his car stopped working. Then when my friend drove there the next day her car stopped working
Mom says "don't say that on camera" as I'm hitting the like button cause its my favorite part 😂😂😂
When Ryland's dad said "California is toxic" I felt that lmaoooo
Yay!! Been waiting for this , welcome back !! X
Shane please let the dam cats alone. Thx
🥰🥰Morgan is an AMAZING storyteller! 🥰🥰
Shane I know your feeling really creative and inspired, but the editing in these videos are getting ridiculous, you keep pointing in more people and sources and they just continue to repeat the same thing over and over again. And the music MAN please lay off just a bit. Just let Morgan speak.
My favorite family ❤️❤️❤️
Shane, it means so much to have you back, more than ever ❤️
Thank you for coming back I've been waiting for you to come back!!! I hate how others are already making a documentary about you again it's for clout really so they could get some views but as you can see on how much views and likes your getting this should tell you who your supporters are and that we've been anxiously and excitedly waiting for you so thank you for being brave enough to come back... Thank you and Godbless ..💋💋💋
I love ryland’s dad so much
hey shane! I think you should do a video on the Mckamey manor horror house it just doesn’t sit right with me. Maybe you’ve heard of it but I think it would make a great video idea! The place is a literal tortute chamber. Still can’t believe it’s all legal.
I love those dogs omg lmaoo
The dude just talking is my favorite 💀
We missed you ! I never hated u!!
Yassssss
No man, watching Sam and Colbys videos aren't even this scary. Bruh the part of the park is too much
Love how humans think we are so special that our bodies would make the best compost ever lol
I shouldn’t be watching this before bed but here I am 🥴
1:02 an aspiration... lmao, you mean apparition? Are these people for real? We all make mistakes but if you're making a documentary/series about apparitions you should probably get it right
I agree with the dad California seems very toxic.
I LOVE Ryland's family sm!! they're so much fun to be around
i hate third bridge. very triggered now thank you 😅
I’m surprised he didn’t try anything on the little girl ghost 🥴
Shane sooooo needs to come to Rotorua New Zealand! We have a man made hill called teletubbie hill which has an haunted abandoned insane asylum/hospital underneath it, the negative energy around it is next level 😬
I dont care if this guy is cancelled. He always makes the best theory videos.
omg
omg
i love that he moved to colorado, now i get a history lesson on my county
Omg I’m so happy he’s making videos again
Thank you for adding us to your video.
Morgan: “ I refuse to die until I have at least one accounted boyfriend.” Yup me too😂
don’t watch this when you’re high
I'm watching just for the drama
That devious lick challenge is stupid.. can’t believe these kids think it’s cool to destroy property like that.
Truly love seeing Morgan so happy. She’s glowing and looks at peace at home. Can’t wait to see her house finalized. Shane doing hauntings is a whole mood. I love it!!
not the devvious licks talk LMAOOO
Why is Morgan living with her parents ? Didn’t she but a house ?
My new ringtone: 33:38 & 33:44
How have I missed the return of my favorite YouTuber of all time!?!?!?!?!? I'm so happy your doing so well Shane! I have missed your content. You are the gold standard of independent internet video content! Shane: 33:38 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
omg my sister has the exact same shark plush as Morgan!
I literally thought of you 3 days before you posted your first video after not posting one in over a year. I had this weird feeling you were coming back like really soon. And then you did! How bizarre! Just so glad to see you back! Me and my husband been watching since the days you were in you're young 20's! A long time!
We use drums for more reasons than.war.
I low key want to share my ghost experience, because it’s more spiritual and I am learning how to communicate with them.
Morgan looks like adele 😍
can you guys adopt me?? i just want to be apart of this family.
Buddy still hella sus with kids and animals. We aint forget
I literally live in Colorado and frequent chesemen park! I had no idea, now I’m going to go ghost hunt. Can’t believe I missed Shane in Colorado 😭😭
Welcome back ❤️  F the haters🖤
Theirs probably not a single square foot on this Earth without a dead person (or their remaining),  theirs been literally billions and billions of humans on this Earth and you think someone hasn't die on the soil you step on 👀💀
Bruce is so wholesome
Missed you Shane, much love🧡🧡❤️❤️
Omg I saw a video of cheesman park on this YouTuber named kelsi Davis she is a medium. You should team up and have a Caleb her and her friends. I know for sure if u guys did do a Caleb it would be epic.
the way my mom has the same pumpkin pillows on her couches as rylands parents tj maxx supremacy lmao
this series is fun and all but this really should have only been one part
ok but morgan looks fucking gorgeous
Shane: I hope I don’t die!! Rylands grandma: yep.
Okay but she was describing Shane's ghost and tell me why I've seen that before....oof I got the heebie jeebies
So happy Shane is back ❤️ this is the perfect way to spend my Sunday with a coffee and spooky Shane series 👻 I thought I was the only one obsessed with how beautiful Morgan looked! Then I saw the comments 🤣😍🥰 she’s stunning and so SWEET!
I legit had a dream about the columns in Cheesman park... I never knew what the place in my dream was until now. 😳
Never thought youd post again and got a lot of hate for still following you. But I know the humor back then. Everyone made fucked up jokes in that era because that's what was popular. Keep doing what makes you happy and your true fans will stay behind you. Glad to see you're happier now
Ok tell me why I JUST MOVED TO CAPITAL HILL IN DENVER😭 right near Cheesman Park. And also after watching the first episode of this series I became incredibly ill, and was throwing up all night.
Not bruce talking about devious licks
Shane is ghost hunting with "the Adams Family" 😂
FINALLY you’re back
Visiting Colorado has always been on my bucket list, I guess it will have to be last on the list 😅
ahhh love this so much!!! missed u on yt shane ❤️
I literally happy that your starting your videos again I missed all your videos and how funny you are Hope yall are doing fine
Hi
i wish they weren't so old lol
Morgan: "Everyones gonna be like, 'wow you've really declined.'"    Literally everyone in the comments: "MORGAN YOU'RE F*CKING STUNNING!" I absolutely love it.
why cant u go to third bridge at night?
I have been to Aurora!!! Omg!!!!!  Yepppoo accurate
*11:34* I heard: *4 skeletons were found playing frisbee* 😂😂 (my stomach/I can’t 🙈😂)
morgan is so beautiful :)
Love ya shane!
Who thought it was a good idea to build a whole ass park on top of a burial ground
I love you Shane! That was scary. I have had odd things happen to me when I was younger like around 5 or 6 and it’s crazy that I remember it like it was yesterday. But I saw a lady under my grandmothers bed where I use to sleep at every weekend. I also saw a man infront of my grandmothers bed. I never seem to get that picture out my head. I am now 27 years old and still to this day question what the hell did I saw 👀 this was in NY
I legit hate ghost stories and stuff but I love Shane so much that I watched this! ❤️🤯👻☠️👽
whenever they talked abt the demons beating on drums, my mind went straight to demon slayer😂😂
Can we get AN ADAMS HOW WE DO IT CHANNEL STARING RYLAND DAD WITH GUEST APPEARANCES BY EVERYONE ELSE. Would love to see Ryland dad teach him how to change his own in the Gulf Wagon epic
So stoked you’re back!!!! I missed your goofy self
Devious lick
#EVERYCHILDMATTERS🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
anyone else thinking about missing and murdered indigenous women? or bodies/bones  of residential school children/babies being found? recently? i would like to see if shane would even talk about that or even  look into it because thats a BIG issue right now world wide these videos are triggering af but man i wonder if he does think about those things?
Okay the end when the photos changed! I will not sleep well tonight.
morgan is so pretty
Missed youuuuu🤍
I heard a voice whisper in my ear don’t be scared
I hate how he has to watch every single word he says now cuz of nasty ass cancel culture. You can’t even be human and make mistakes anymore without it ruining your life and mental stability 😔
MISSED YOU ALL!
Kendall Rae collaboration!!!!
This was awesome. The stories with the extra clips with info and images just MAKE this extra special. Thanks!
I can't be the only one who missed shane dawson's vids
sooooooo gooooodddd.....
NOT RYANS DAD TALKING ABOUT DEVIOUS LICKS
No cuz literally every public schools in the Philippines was once a cemetery (^^)
Liking the video before it even starts
stop rylands dad is so precious 😂🥺❤️
I cant even watch these anymore, I used to be obsessed with Shane, now I kinda just find him annoying.
Cheese man sounds creepy in itself
morgan is gorgeous !!
“What you put on social media will stay there forever” okay ya right cause I wish I could access my old MySpace photos but they’re all gone!
i wonder if shane has seen the tiktoks about him 💀
I don't wanna hear it, Bruce ain't Ryland's dad, this man is Daniel Predas father
i was staring at morgan the whole time shes literally so pretty
So just like the first ep a whole lotta nothing 😐
It’s nice hearing Shane’s laugh again ❤️
You put your wang in cats
I know this place. I’ve been there. When we went, there was a car on the side, we came back & it was on fire. The sounds, the screaming & the drums…. It’s all real😖
The tiktoks there talking about is happening where I live my younger siblings are now doing online because of that stupid bullshit cause these kids are deciding to be a bunch of idiots and record themselves doing that there generation are a bunch of fucking idiots
fuck all of these haters, I've been going through serious Shane Withdrawal
Stop laughing so i can hear chris
i’ve missed you so much:( welcome back shane 🌚❤️
“Yummy.” — I AM OVER
when I tell you i audibly screamed when I got the notification.
“ I refuse to die until I have one accounted boyfriend.” - Morgan Adams’s 2021
Shane Dawson uses his popularity for good, like Marky Mark planting a tree for charity ❤️
OMG I have been waiting
the devious licks shut our bathrooms down for the next month. kids stole an entire urinal and flooded everything. it’s honestly insane
Morgan was the protagonist of this episode and she killed it.
“Did they just run out of dance moves.”😭😂
MISSSED HIM SOOOOOOOOO MUCH YAY IM GLAD HES BACK💜💜💜
Omg wtf. I literally just grabbed my shark plush to hold and then the old clip of Morgan come up with her holding the exsact same share plush.. that was definitely a weird coincidence
the dad carrying the brown dog's so cuteee
Oh, fun. A false flag going down way back in the the 1800’s. Promising.
As an Indigenous Northern Arapaho women, I am beyond grateful you recognized us in this series.
Imagine, kids that have no respect for other’s property 🙄. Anytime something gets trending people will follow it, no matter how stupid it is.
i love you and missed you so much love this
you need to go to riverdale road
I’m sorry but YouTube needed this. I haven’t watched anything on YouTube as entertaining as this in a very very long time.
Gotta say regardless of how much I like or hate the person, this is top tier comedy for when I’m high af on allergy meds
So everyone's acting like nothings happened..? Ew
morgan looks like taylor swift
COME VISIT SAVANNAH, GEORGIA! 🙌🏼 🪦 👻
literally rylands dad talking about the devious licks like it’s a war zone is killing me
:)
Ped apologist
We literally miss you SHANE 💖😍
Literally love you forever ❤️💜
18:48 SCREAMING
Like if Shane should go back to the Queen Mary…..
Growing up in high school mantorville Minnesota , haunted place . We have a 3rd bridge where teens would always go and jump off into the water but it’s strange… getting same vibes
Okay but Shane looks a little more healthy? Is that just me?
omg Halloween theme means haunts and ghouls *sleeps with lights on*
Ryland’s dad is a literal mood talking about the TikTok trends
Morgan is gorgeous! This was really good I don’t want it to end.
Love this series!! Shane, you're on top, as always!
Omg Morgan is looking so great these days.
She wouldn’t hear them comin’😂😂😂
So happy that ur back Shane ,I've missed u so much.  Can't wait for more amazing content.  Love you u all xx
I live in Denver and cheeseman park isn’t that scary. Calm tf down. I’ve been there since I was a kid. It’s not that scary. Chill
CA is indeed toxic
I’m so happy Shane is back and the Cheesman Park story is kinda sad RIP to all the bodies that are buried there and the people who died in the Sand Creek Massacre
Waiting patiently for conspiracy theories videos.
Looooll “I’m a big white man who wants to show the creepie spookies”
film cheesman park…. or whatever it’s called
Ppl keep saying that Morgan looks genuinely happy, but I mean she seems the same lol. She could always be depressed as heck.. think y’all are confused cuse shes lookin good in this lol
“She wouldn’t hear them coming” 😂
What happend to Shane's dogs like honey?
big oooff because of the Aspen in Colorado where not only the victims of Ted Bundy but also his ashes lay…. watching the video, I was like „okay wait I have to look up where the Aspens are and yay… Colorado sounds really nerve wrecking
Aaaaaaaaa 👏👏 I frickin love Shane’s videos
I'm not sure if he did this on purpose but I love that this series came out just in time for Halloween. I always used to love watching Shane's videos during my lunch break at work but this has been especially fun since the vibes match the season. Though my break isn't actually long enough to watch a video in one sitting, I'm still so glad my favorite person on Youtube is back!
Just sending lots of love, light and support :)
Thank god you're back. Just checked into your account and I was like wtf man
Morgan looks BOMB
WHILE WATCHING I FELT COLD AIR BLAST MY FACE WITH NO EXPLANATION….felt like breathing
Hey Shane, how is Teresa, miss her so much and hope she’s okay
Shane. Huge fan. I have your old hot topic shirts. Please stop.
And sometimes when it rains bones come to surface
Chessmen park was once a graveyard.
Thanks for shining light on native Americans 🙏🏼 were still here but seems like nobody pays attention to how we live especially in the rural areas..
Morgan is so cute bro im not lesbian tho i just think she pretty
ryland's dad talking about devious licks is my new aesthetic
Okay you know what, i thought Ryland was just ignorant and naive but like those weird comments about the girls and his dads comments on teenagers leads me to believe they're all fucking predators.
Just an fyi, since this is part 2 of a 3 part series, it'd be helpful if you change the text in the description from "LAST PART" to "FIRST PART" or "PREVIOUS PART". I clicked it twice before I figured out you didn't mean the final part :P
Daddys back
10:36 --> "Thats a weird looking dog...oh..OH..thats a baby"
Maybe I shouldn’t watch this at 1:27 I. The morning
I love how Rylands dad is coming out of his shell lol
hahahahaah kendall rae
Morgan is so pretty
It sounds like freaking Jumanji
Why does Shane just randomly  carry his  jacket around  on his shoulders?
Shane can literally work in a thriller movie and even as a villian ❤️
gen z's cancel culture goin' real strong I see
SHANE IS BACK AND I AM LIVING FOR IT💜💜💜💜
Looking at how much time has passed, it’s so obvious how much everyone has grown, including myself.
Okay but like Morgan is fucking gorgeous
to rylands dad...not all of us are toxic, i promise! come to northern cali, enjoy the scenery, go to napa valley have some amazing wine, go to our coastline, bodega bay, etc, its completely different than southern cali. please come visit us up here, you will appreciate more of what california has to offer. :) much love to ryalnds family, chris and his family and shane and ryland and shanes family.  and of course, the gorgeous morgan. we love you  all
Human compost is no better than normal compost. Just saw a video on it from ask a mortician lol
I dont know why but ryland and morgans dad being super upset about the bathroom vandalism is so funny like hes sooooo mad and thats exactly what the kids want
HE'S BACK 😀
Shane is investing devious licks 😭
Everyone in that house is so dramatic 💀💀i cannot take them serious lmao
They’re actually going to rename mount Evan’s because he’s so bad
i wanna smoke with the park spirits
we missed you shane :) glad youre back
“You’re the only source of electricity they can find” so I’m just paying my electric bill for nothing? 🤨
fave part of the video:  Morgan: "did you guys know that the annoying orange is back?" lol
thank you for sharing about that tragedy.. being canadian i had no idea about it.
why are you back
Awe, Morgan shouldn't be ashamed to be back at home, adulthood is hard
YOUR BACKKKKKK
Cali is just filled with vile, fake people. Please stay in Colorado 'cause I feel like your guys' mental health has improved so much!
i live for bruces comments
I love Rylands dad 😂😂
Hey Shane……I think you may be haunted by the shadow man. Long trench coat and hat. That’s the shadow man.
23:27 who is that
I’ve been waiting for thissssss  🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I feel like this is good, but like mr camera guy is just so fucking annoying. Plus, Shane is like ok meh… its just entertaining but like I don’t like you dude
Muy interesante
That man with the hat and trenchcoat is also in my house. He just watches us.
I'm honestly surprised they never in any video mentioned of the Columbine massacre, that happened so close from where Morgan and Ryland lived
Bruce!! I love you so much! I agree with you and everything you said!! Bless you, fine Sir!   Shane - I’m so glad your back. Hot damn you were missed by me and my family. We love ya!!   *Waves* Hi Ryland and Morgan! I thought Morgan bought a house? I’ll have to catch up.   Love to everyone! ❤️
poor native americans 🥺
Ryland's mother has the ULTIMATE set up omg yassss!
Morgan's story is giving me drunk history vibes and I love it -- not saying she sounded drunk, but I loved the way she was telling things haha
To me its not scary, but incredibly sad, that the bodies of thousands of people were mutilated and then had their mutilated parts transferred, all for the sake of money. They were people once too, even if they aren't still here physically. Thats so very sad.
Hi Nicki if you’re reading this😜
Shane coming in time for spooky season is iconic
Shane Dawson is living proof that you can do pretty much anything that's going to suck and people are still going to forgive if you make content that's interesting
YouTube keeps censoring my comments, so I'm gonna say it again:  Watch D'Angelo Wallace's video about Shane. Shane is not a good person and does not deserve a second chance. The amount of people that continue to support him despite not even knowing what happened is concerning to me. Please educate yourselves, for the love of god.
omg shane and kendal rae yessss
“It’s dead… like the massacre victims… anyways” 😂
Yeah in are school kids have been taking the soap and now they don't put soap in the bathrooms
🧐
Hahahaha I was like okay Kendall!!!!! Go Morgan you nailed that
Wouldnt that be like a giant tourist attraction? They wont remove the rest because they are profiting atm, especially now
I have so many stories about this park I live here
The girl who described the spirit with the hat sounded like she was describing hat man. If you see the comment you should look it up. Love the video btw ❤️
okay but the lil moment between morgan and chris when she says she wants a mans before she dies? do i smell,,, chemistry?
Any place called Cheesman Park is gonna be sketchy af.
morgan has always been beautiful but recently she looks so GOOOODDD 😍😍😍😍😍
Morgan looks stunning 😍
The series should have ended after the conversation at 27:21 lol
I could cry I’m so happy you’re back shane. You’ve grown into such a beautiful soul and It warms my heart to know that you’re in such a better place now. ❤️
Can we just notice how pretty Morgan is and I’m happy Shane and Ryland are back !
“👺👹 LIKE THE MASSACRE VICTIMS... anyways what I’m doing here ☺️”
GO TOO CHEESMAN PARK!!
I have to say: Morgan looks GORGEOUS
At my school the teachers stand in the bathroom during passing period and took the soap Dispensers off the walls cause of all the devious licks. Some kid also stole a bathroom door. I'm also so happy that Shane and my childhood friends are still having fun with demons
Okay so holy shit. She was talking about the man in black from 1800’s!!! Please contact me Shane I have seen that man my whole life!!!!
33:10 this took me out 💀😭
I’m so ready for more Shane content, especially scary stuff!! He came back at just the right time
Ive missed you so much
I grew up in Canon City Colorado and there is soooo many haunted places down there
Morgan is so beautiful
@20:48 They cant refuse...because of the implication.
I've missed these so much! So excited to watch the last part when I get home from work.
I'm screaming oml. MY ELECTRIC CAR ATTACKED MY ASS. bruh papa Adam's is too much
"Things follow me" yeah your past...
Why did I feel like Morgan was explaining the plot to frozen 2 lmao
Ryland's dad is such a vibe. Honestly love him.
YES SHANEEEE😛😛
Seeing his videos again feels like home. I hope if he sees this it brings a smile to his face! 🤗
I don't like the camera man
I am filled with joy
When I started watching this my phone was charging fine like I just bought this charger an it was brand new an then I got the thing that pops on your screen when your phones about to die an I had to unplug the box an replug in my charger for it to work which is weird cuz that’s never happened before
Why is the soldier's face blurred? Found that a bit odd and now my curiosity is killing me lol
I'm sorry I can't get over how gorgeous Morgan looks. She looks so much more at peace with herself and confident. Love a thriving Queen. 💜
Hey Shane i dont know if u know this but have u heard about the "Missing 404 phenomen"? Sorry for my bad english. Love ur videos <3
i missed these videos SO MUCH
Off topic but Morgan looks so good
I loveeee Omar gosh!!! You guys should do a collab!!!!!
What are you doing back Shane? You don't just come back after all the horrible shit you did. I believe in you and you're just like the rest of them!
Hear me out: Riverdale Road. Starts in thornton, CO ends in brighton, CO?? Either way. Most haunted road in the country.
I can’t get over how amazing Morgan looks
I'm loving Rylands dad being so mad the the Tik Tok kids being stupid
18:37 this guy
This is fun and all, but the fact is that ghosts arent real, and all those videos of people telling what it is, is fucking annoying, dangerous, and manipulative. Good thing that stuff like that isnt very legal and/or popular in other countries, because its literally just manipulation of naive people, usually for monetary gains.
Oh my word yes, now i can binge watch your videos again. I missed this😩
Rylands mums pumpkin pillow is GORGEOUS 🎃
Ngl, this is really boring.
I love you Shane you make me happy I don’t care what other people say past is past you got me out of the darkest times❤️
“The king is back I look around it’s not the samethey love you first they dis you next that’s just the game”
Im just gonna say this, the editing of this video is so incredibly good, its beyond amazing. We missed you shane
The tea it's burning hot today
The way she looked at her grandma when she said afraid of a little ghosty ghost
Morgan  looks like a  Queen.
loved the kendal rae shoutout
So happy he is back! 🥰🥰 cant wait to see what him and Ryland do with this new property
Missed this Shane I’m glad your back !♥️
i love the confusion the licks brought to the whole of rylands family
Let's also not forget the Navajo Skin Walkers.
FINALLY YOURE BACK AHHHH WEVE MISED YOU
I miss your contents Shane, glad that u’re back!
Now that Shane's back, I'm waiting for Jenna
Does anyone else like Shane’s videos before you watch?! 🤪 just me?!? Okay!
I can't believe i'm seeing this a whole week after it was posted.A WEEK. Shane, I'm happy you're back. I still love the editing, but I especially love the "don't cancel me plz" finishing touches 😂
my house is haunted. for the first year of us living in it, at night our kitchen cabinets would open and closes at 2:08am- everynight. until one of us yelled "shut up mr. green." We were instructed by the previous owner to say it exactly like that. mr. green was the father of the seller. he died in our house along with his wife. but since we settled into the home i think he welcomed us due to stopping his shit lol
“Hmm **bites pizza** I don’t think so I cleansed it” **shrugs**
morgan is gorgeous
It's 2021 can we please already stop believing in ghosts
Cheesman Park is actually horrifying
I've never cried and smiled so much in two years. This is the content that will heal the horror that has been Quarantine 🥰
4:09 time stamp for me to come back
Hahah, that guy licking that battery! What in the world? So hysterical and strange.😂
Bro I really wanna get with Morgan like god she’s amazing…I’m literally crushing on her 😍😍😍😍😍
off topic but morgan’s beautiful
Omar Gosh being exposed on Shane’s video! Woohooo! Love Omar… “give me a kiss”
ryland saying he would bring girls to that area because there was no service so they were scared & they were more likely to make out with him does not sit right with me
is no one gonna talk about the fact that ryland took girls out to an abandoned town with no service to trick them into hooking up?
her saying “keke” at the far end is sending me
OH HELL NO ftr you reap what you soe,  Shane cuz karma is coming for you. 💀
I LOVE RYLANDS DAD
I just had this idea. When people say anything about weird stuff happening. They are gonna said "There must be a reasonable explanation". Then turns our they just hypothetically listed what may be the cause. But its just a bunch of theory and could never be proven. So what should you do if you find something weird or hear something weird... the answer is "Find Out". BAM GOOD Movie Title. Hollywood write it down.
When you showed the orbs were gone from the photos I got the goosebumps and then my dog started barking at me and jumping all over me. 😳
Colorado has a lot of crazy people like that time some family was murderer in a trailer park
Aurora theater shooting Columbus school shooting and king soopers shooting in 2021
Morgan is the most beautiful and the sweetest. Id love to be her friend.
Morgan telling stories is the best
I’m loving your new videos! Keep it up Shane!! 💜
I have a picture of an apparition from the crash site on the road to 3rd bridge. The last time we went there, there were handprints all over the car
Love Shane, but the overuse of snipits from other videos gets frustrating after a while..
Ok but the dog rylands dad was holding was absolutely gorgeous 😭😭
Hey guys I need your help... what is the movie from the 11:42 called? I have been looking for it for years now. It is my first horror movie that I can remember and would be amaizing to finally know the title and rewatch it😁😁😁😁
The people left in Cheesman weren’t necessarily “bad people” No, they were impoverished, indigent or without kin. That’s it, no money to move them…sort of salacious to categorize neglected and desecrated corpses as “bad people“. It’s misleading at best. And yes I know this is entertainment but those are real people.
Morgan is so pretty I stg
Grandma is everything!! Protect grandma at all costs!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please make more videos Shane! I miss your content!
Ok, the lady saying “ghosts need energy to survive…” get out of here. Energy is all around, they don’t need us to survive 🙄
Glad to see you're back dood.
I really felt what Bruce was talking about with the students destroying school bathrooms… it seems like everytime I have to go poo, the toilet paper dispensers are stolen… I just go home at that point. It even got so bad that some people stole the mirrors off the wall, peed in the soap dispensers, pushed down the stalls and broke a sink
HES BACK
I have a long trench-coat and a hat.
You over did the horror effects and it came out underwhelming. My life feels so bland and sad now-a-days.
Kinda disappointed…
Morgan is beautiful!
You utterly disgust me shane
I came here for Bruce and I’m pacified, that is a funny man who doesn’t get enough screen time
your videos make me so happy you have no idea 🥺
I live in Kansas in a 110 year old house that definitely has some paranormal activity. I have firsthand experience with a docile spirit that followed me for about 6 months. Spirits are absolutely real and nothing to mess around with.
This turned into a history video 😂😂
34:15 Never cringed so hard in my life 😣painful cringe.
Morgan looks so pretty she looks different
So crazy... The guy doing your local news was an anchor in FL where I live for years. Lol.
I'd risk it all for Morgan
I’m dead scared cuz it’s real
i literally squealed when i saw he posted
lol
Morgan is so fucking pretty.
You guys should visit st Augustine in Florida, there are over 1000 bodies buried in the city. There are buildings and streets over a lot of their burial spots. Only 100 tombstones exist for the people who are buried so most of them are in unmarked graves
It really trips me put that Shane is in Denver now, where I grew up cheesemen Park is in the ghetto lol so many homeless people and street food that's sooo good 😋 never heard of a cemetery being there loll
I have never seen Shane in so much discomfort about something or someone's death
11:00 where we live is Native American burial ground which kinda aggravates me that my parents chose to live here.
Omg I LOVE Ryland's family!! They seem so fun!!🖤🖤
Rylands dad or whatever is annoying asf “we should prosecute them” like schools weren’t already destroyed before this trend started. The pics they showed was my school 24/7 with broken paper towel things and soap dispensers toilet paper on the ceiling shit on the walls.
That dog looks so sad and cute at the same time.
Ahhhh Morgan looks so prettyyyy
I love grandma so much having her in videos makes me smile.
Love!!!!
Glad you’re back! Always amazing content 🙏🏻✨
Morgan you look so beautiful!! I mean you are gorgeous and now you just seem more glowing.
Cant stand psychics....they know they are full of shit and I dont see how anyone can take them seriously. I dont know how the girl in the video can say those things about Shane being haunted with a straight face....for the last time....Psychics are full of shit people
This feels so much darker than his other videos about haunted places... it's so real...
10:32
In part 3 I'm waiting for Shane's birthday to show up cause it always did in the other scary videos 😂😂👌
tbh it doesnt really matter if he did or didnt do whatever it is yall say he did bc the truth is. its entertainment that people just watch to feel good 99% of people just take his apoligy see he realizes it was wrong and move on. to the people contiusly crusading in the comments..... ive seen the stuff and its honestely sad. i have no horse in this race but just stop lmao you arent going to change anyones minds here.
SHANE- "IS THIS BAD KARMA CAUSE IM JUST A BIG WHITE MAN TRYING TO SHOW THE CREEPY SPOOKYS" ME-LMAO 😂🤣👀
Ok I didn't expect Roland's dad to be so....eccentric?
Me and my girl Lucy used to go to the third bridge for fun when we didn’t have anything to do
You will probably not see this Shane, but seriously I have watched your apology / Jenna Marbles apology.... and I get frustrated with us viewers. Honestly, 10 years ago I think humor was more "open"....I think it's unfair to go back into the past and use things against anyone. God, if my past were filmed...I would be screwed too. Nonetheless, I think people have become so sensitive...and search for things to put you (or other creators down)...however, I bet most individuals shitting on you / Jenna Marbles have done a lot of shit that wouldn't be acceptable in 2021....I've watched you since I was 12....I know you just like to make us laugh...and I am thankful for it. I'm frustrated with all the blame and negativity...this is just what youtube has sadly become. Anyways much love to you.
Ryland's dad is fucking gold lmao
Shane I hope you’re doing well King 💗💗
does ur toothbrush curl up when you try and use it?
*NEW VIDEO* This Ruined My Life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-lV-VaQkQ0
When Shane asked Ryland’s Grandma “do you know what we’re talking about?” I can’t be the only one who was waiting for her to say “Dragonflies”
There is no way he is back…
12K dislikes and they're ALL from Twitter users
Omg nobody told me Shane was back!!!
MISSED YOU
Why are these surprised about the school bathroom thing this has been going for years 💀
“I’m so happy he’s back” babes have you been ,, living under a rock?
POST A SCARY HALLOWEEN ONE PLSSSSS I WANT TO BE SCARED
omg my schools devious lick photo is in this video
Welcome back Shane!
Omg ur back!!!!!
Part3!!!!
I’m trying to be patient but I’m so excited lol
I’m watching again to be ready for the third part🙂 also I love Omar !!!!! @OmarGoshTV I’m so happy to see him on your video even if it was just seconds haha.
Here waiting for part 3
I forgot how amazing the editing on these videos are. Keep up the amazing work Shane!
genuinely love how much hate comments just turn up engagement and push this video further 😂😂😂 so stupid
LMFAAOOA the guy licking the battery
we have a place almost exactly like that here called dark canyon. It was filled with urban legends. When I was in high school we would load up in cars at night and stop on the bridges and turn the car off (so stupid)  nothing ever happened but we tried lol
Shane came back and did NOT come to play‼️
Aren't we all walking on dead bodies all the time? I feel like the earth is so old that there's dead bodies just like everywhere...
❤️❤️❤️
Ummm where tf is part 3???
I am SO excited this is back !!!
Rylands dad is a whole mood😂😂😂😂😂😂
hey pettyfile whats this channel still doing up
I’ve missed you Shane😭❤️ clicked the video IMMEDIATELY
I would love to see more of this
I missed his content so much..
*New upload by SHANE* Me: everyone stfu ‼️😂
Liked the video before seeing it bc I knew it would be good, but forgot, and just tried to like it again 😶
i want to be morgan so bad
Bruce and grandma need their own channels
anyway i hate you
LOL not him trying to delete my comments
lol dont even try to delet my comment
Hey Shane! I think you should maybe consider doing a fundraiser or something for an indigenous cause that may be prevalent to communities in Colorado. I think it would bring a lot of awareness with your platform. There’s so many terrible things coming out about our country’s history lately. I love scary content and I think it’s a great way to bring to life some of the terrors from the past that still cause issues today. Sending lots of love to you and your family!! ❤️
anyway cry about you being cancel
I need part 3!!! I’m hooked now 🥰
you
hate
hope you will see this and understand howyou disapointed me.
can you just destroy this useless channel ?
i hate you :)
cant wait to see you being the jail !
bro is really trying to make us think that talking trash to minors was an accident ????
I’M SO READY FOR THE FINALE 😭😭😭
Shane is back 😻
Who would even want to live in a shithole state 😭
“Can you squash this TikTok influencer Shane?” 😂😂😂😂 I love Ryland’s family so much 😂💗
Bro is deleting comments 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Delete this channel asap 🤗
I HATE YOU
Love to see Morgan still being politically correct seeing Native Americans
Morgan needs to become a model
more scary content!!
I’ve loved Shane since 2012 and I will never stop because you are one of the best YouTubers you make me laugh so much your whole family as well :) I love it and thank you for being you ❤️
KENDALL 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Honestly shane.. you should just try to make a movie.. really. This is what you are born to❣️
It was good seeing Shane back on YouTube I missed him
Honestly so happy seeing you post again! So ready for part 2 🥰!!! #SpookySeason 👻👻
A collab with Kendall Rae would literally be everything! So much spooky content! 👻
DEVIOUS LICKSSS
he said i "retired" sir you got ran off the internet for doing £LACKF4C3...... stop playing victim?
this world is so fucked how did everyone just forgive him like that
So happy you’re back Shane.!
Wait how does barely anything happen in 30 mins
The editing is different
Lmaoooo yes people live out there... I live literally minutes from that place and I know there's a house like literally right next to third bridge....
Good to see you back Shane
Shane’s acting has gotten even worse
the editing >
I'm not here to be morally right or wrong... 😶
When the next one coming out
So happy you're back shane 💕
do more conspiracy theories
Conspiracy series
Conspiracy theory from Shane Dawson are a banger !! Please keep uploading conspiracy theory’s pleaseeee it’s a series!
YAYYYYYYY ANOTHER SHANE VIDEOOOO!! 😍😍😍
Now all I wanna see is Morgan and Kendall Rae do a video 🤣🤩
I'm so glad your back!
don't come back to YouTube. good God. Jenna canceled herself and didn't do near as bad as you.   You can stay away.
Welcome back Shane I missed you ❤
He’s baaack
the most devious lick 😈
Did Ryland just say he brought girls out to this rural area without cell phones because girls would be more likely to make out when they're scared? ...and feel unsafe because they can't get a ride out of there. This is so predatory
Rewatching in anticipation of part 3 this evening 🤓
X🤗O 😘 X🤗O😘X🤗O😘X🤗
Im taking a shot every time i hear that RIDICULOUS "horror music" see y'all on the other side
Happy your backkk
Not yall actually supporting him after he was cancelled- I cant with yall-
BRO like 2 months ago I commented on a video saying”are we not gonna talk about Morgan’s ghost”
Man it is good to see all of you guys back. It brings me so much joy that you heard all of us requesting stuff like this. Getting flashbacks to the good times :)
I missed you ❤️ I’m in the waiting room while my dad is in surgery. Seeing that you have a video uploaded made me feel better. Thank you😊
Welcome back Shane!
I’m so happy they’re back
I volunteer as Morgans Boyfriend
i can’t explain how much i missed him.
Dİslike him
Where is uno
yall really switched up on shane lol. weirdos
Ryland’s dad is hilarious!
I’m so excited for this
Licking that battery haha hurry up with the end! I have no patience
Anyone else love rylands family lol
As a white girl I can’t accept Shane’s apology about his past. But as his future self I like him. I hate his past don’t get me wrong but  I like Shane.. am I wrong for still wanting to support him even tho I can’t accept his past? I can’t help but feel guilty for still wanting to watch someone like him. I like his content but I also like urs and I see the truth of it all.. idk YouTube shouldn’t b this much part of my life decisions ahaha but yh anyone else feel the same?. Hate Shane for what he’s done but can’t help but want to forgive. (Ik the racism i cant speak for) but I do think everything he said and done as “jokes” in the past is disgusting. there’s no excuse for it and his apology wasn’t good enough. And in no way shape or form would I ever discriminate someone with a different skin tone to me. I’m a gay 18 year old who id say myself has respect for anyones age, gender, skin colour, sex. I’m so open minded the last thing I would want is to b associated with racism. So is it bad I still like shane? The whole perverted comments also can’t b ignored I know this also but with time going by and maturing done. Is it bad that I want to watch him still
Oooh~ When is the finale coming out? :>>>>
when is part 3 coming 😩😩😩😩
Is this video new!,,!!!!YESss
16:29 But goes there anyway 👁👄👁
Please tell me part 3 is coming out today
_I LOVE THEM. GREAT WORK._ 😇😍🥰
Oh how I missed this.
Grandma is so adorable
Not surprising that they start joking around when talking about the genocide of Native Americans…
Boring, seems fake, like a children YouTube channel
Growing up in Colorado I heard Capitol Hill and went “oh no”  Riverdale road is in Colorado it has gates to hell and a bunch of other stories
The monitor of Ryland mom 🤯🤯
Why no one told me shane started uploading
In an area of Colorado My nieces district had kids set the highschool bathroom on fire and the whole district had to send out an awareness. It’s challenges, starts with that one then goes to them “hit a teacher in the back” and more teachers are being threatened. Kids are now transported to take a piss
Okay I hope the next one is good, cause that felt like 2 episodes of fluff.
3:41
Morgan said aspiration instead of apparition hahaha
I know I not the only 1 that herd hello at 1:40
All the people supporting this 🤢🤮
Shane!! What if you go with Sam and Colby to a abandoned haunted place??? That would be a awesome Collab and fun video
I missAndrew
Who is behind the camera
I like the content not the content creator
Ok but the fact that the chief of the Native American tribe lifted the American flag and the troops flag and they were still all massacred is so sad. That’s like someone literally saying “wait we’re friends, I thought I was on your side” while you murder them.
Ryland is so sweet he stops to smell the flowers.
I didn't know families like Ryland's still exists in the US.
Shane can u do a theory on ‘the hum’?
Hello what is the new upload schedule please
when’s the last part coming out lmao it’s been 6 days
Shane: did they just run out of dances?
I love Shane im so happy he’s back 💞
Morgan is serving LOOKS damn
i didn’t know you started posting again- 💀
need this pt2 asap
The devious licks😈😈
so who killed the wife & 2 children and nathan
Morgan must use a beauty filter on her own videos bc she looks completely different when she’s not the one in charge of editing
scariest part of this video: "the annoying orange is back"  o.o
I missed this <33
naw...
Holy shit I’m happy you are making videos. I don’t care what anyone says. Would love the opportunity to meet you and do some voice work
4:26 I love Shane’s editing. Perfect example here.
Literally how are people even supporting this man
I never been so happy since he's been back XD and the chaotic energy with everyone
Morgan is so beautiful 😫
🥺😭I have missed you so much Shane! My life feels whole again.
i wish i could go back to when i was oblivious to shane’s mess ups, i miss loving these vids
Just remember NOT to judge governors or people today by the actions  of one lousy governor! Love this series guys. Morgan, you are beautiful and Shane you have been missed! So glad you are back.
no because Chris is SO FUCKING LOUD idk how to feel about him yet
the devious licks 💀💀
d3l3t3 ur channel
just came to dislike this 🥰
dude I love u but those chills fak im not watching this too pussy
bruh im a bit annoyed that rylands dad was like "THEY NEED TO BE PROSECUTED" bruh it was just  dumb trend
Why the hell are there so many people still supporting him
I live In Kentucky and this same story is told here lol. This bridge in the woods has the same lore. 🤷‍♀️
Can y’all please hype Kendall up more cause RESPECT
please make a scary movie ! your editing skills are a total superior independent film vibe and i just can’t !
This actually creeped me out ngl
I’m glad your back Shane :)
*me paranoid of this stuff and will start seeing shadows* also me "let's keep watching"
Yess! I’m so glad you are back making videos Shane, I’ve miss you and your videoed so much. So excited for your future videos.
I'm happy hes back.
Can’t wait for part 3 tomorrow!
YES
Wow I missed you guys🥺❤️
You can def tell that California was really toxic to Morgan😕 she seems so genuinely happy and she’s GLOWING
Wish he would have stayed off the internet
31:42 when the black figure popped up i saw a man dressed in in a trench coat with a large nose with a large arch he looked about 40 years old he had brown hair with a brown hat and trench coat with blue eyes and thick eyebrows. idk why i wanted to say this but it felt like i saw shane’s ghost idk.
Ok but why is no one talking about how pretty Morgan looks 😍
I worked a lot around that place. Stepped one foot on it on a 101°f day, and got the chills. I avoid the area at all costs Idc
Rylands dad is weird as shit what’s the fuck was that.
I love that you went to the only place I would go to find paranormal and pray to the lost. CraZyyyy
“She wouldn’t hear them comin” omg Rylandddd hahahahaha
I love you so much you guys
Moving from Colorado a year ago and hearing this is didn’t even know that part about Denver
Shane is truly disgusting to look at. Disgusting on the inside, disgusting on the outside. Barf
he’s back and i’ve never been more excited 😧🖐🏻
And Girlll there’s a new Mandela affect which is that the little dog from the nightmare before Christmas always had a pumpkin nose instead of his little glowing red nose
Okay purrrr we missed you bestie
I’m a card carrying Cheyenne & Arapaho native  and I appreciate you drawing attention to what happened to my people .
Part 3?
god Morgan is so annoying telling that story like yeah we get it! The man was white and?
YEESSSS SHANE IS BACK
there’s no way he doesn’t filter out his comments. this man is disgusting and the fact that people still watch and support him is gross too. the amount of hate and backlash there was, there’s no way all these comments are this positive 😐
Yes
Wellcome back Shane!!! ✨✨👏🏻👏🏻 I’m so happy you’re back and well 😊 can’t wait to see what’s new on your channel 🎊 p.s: Morgan is gorgeous 💕
this is so fucking dumb it hurts
O m g I missed you so much now I don’t have to rewatch all your videos we missed you sooooo much I hope you are doing amazing mentally and physically!!!
Please post more often 😍
😒😒
😒😒
Please bye!!!
Please bye!!!
Please bye!!!
Finally hello Shane
Shane has 20 million  followers and feels  unsuccessful 💔   I want to help him . I feel he is lost. I feel there's a hole  that  keeps him  running in circles in his mind ...a hole that  doesn't need  so much of his mind.   He seems like he is holding back so much but  doesn't know how to get it out. It's like he is in his own way.  Meds help but there is something else. I know it, he knows it.   I want to save his  spirit so it doesn't ever get into a depressed slump again.      Shane , Ryland , Morgan are all so talented.
Bye ill watch this tomorrow when its not 2am and i poo my pants
I wonder how Shane's mom feels about him moving 😕
I love Bruce!
talk about your hey milly stuff ;)
I missed Shane so so so much 😭
Welcome back. Fuckem if they can't take a joke!  Try to do better and let's get to it, it's been to long girl....💖
Also I'm tired of people painting the native American like they didn't have some bloodbath history. Peaceful riiiiiiiight.
Pt 3!! Plzzzz now
the dude recordings laugh👁👄👁
Okay am I the only one irritated at the Lady saying the bodies left behind are criminals and bad people? Cause that pissed me off. I'm sure some are but Id bet my life savings they were the poor and forgotten families. Not criminals. Let's all face it no one who had the cash back then would have left their people there. My grandfather would trespass onto someone's property to visit his sister's and parents. They couldn't afford to move them out of the old private family cemetery.....
When he said California is toxic... I felt that in my soul. I'm from Oklahoma and moved here to Socal and I have to agree.
I absolutely adore rylands family ❤️❤️🥺🥺 they are so sweet to shane and it makes me happy ❤️❤️
WHEN ARE CONSPIRACY THEORYS COMING BACK
That drum beat is a peyote drumbeat.
delete ur acc0unt
you should go to the third bridge in bennet [i think that's where it was] i went there at like 3 am with a few of my coworkers when we go to the bridge only two of us got out i started to walk behind the car i was probably a good 20 feet away from the car and i jokingly said hello and something said hello back. i ran back to the car jumped in the seat and we drove off
DUDEEE when that guy was talking over the recording of the drum beats was annoying me sooo muchhh 😭 like stfu so you can hear and then talk afterrr
Yay for Shane for getting his mojo back and just being the bigger person. I don’t really follow when people get canceled etc not to minimize how that must make people feel I just can’t go down that rabbit whole. I stay in the light. Anyshwayz, shane your amazing and your content always is solid no matter what the subject matter. And like others said, you look content over there. The work on ourselves never ends but you just look like you have all the right ingredients; loving spouse, amazing and supportive family and friends, and a passion to throw yourself into! Rock on and stay strong your so freaking awesome and real
We ain’t forget….
I need a third part nowwww❤️❤️❤️
Kendall Rae and Shane collab would be everything 🤩
finally ily
Morgan is so beautiful wow 😍
So I live in a county right next to where I’m assuming if not the same county as you all, and let me tell you, I’ve been to third bridge multiple times due to growing up literally 10 minutes away from 3rd bridge, I’ve always thought it was just like a “rumored” place just like a lot of places in Colorado that are “haunted” and the first couple times I went I never heard/saw anything, and nothing ever happened to my friends that was “scary” but last time I went we heard drums and then I SWEAR someone was chasing us and my friends and I haven’t been back since, BUT I got multiple places around Elbert/Kiowa/Elizabeth/Denver if u guys want more places (:
Part 3 Let’s gooooo!
Definitely glad to see Shane back. We all do stupid stuff and let’s be honest, we’ve all said inappropriate things including things that will offend people. We all deserve a second chance ❤️
12k dislikes, ANOTHER k , thats 2 k in 24 hours, lets goooo!!!!!!!!!!
2:40 you can hear hello idk who its from
im sorry did ryland seriously just confidently admit he used to take girls to a spot without cell service specifically to scare them into making out with him
Sounds like a Native American drum beat!!!😂😂😂😂 if anyone knows the drum beat😂😂😂  He said as if he didn’t research the place
ARE NONE OF YALL IN SHOCK THAT HES BACK
You’re content should be removed from YouTube💙
lmao what if the beating drum sound is just the jumanji board chillin under the bridge or somethin
morgan looks INCREDIBLE
I went to the Third Bridge in Highschool and we had a moment where a truck started to drive straight at as. In which we started backing up in our car. Then that truck just disappeared it is a one way road so there is no were it could have just turned off.
rylands mom is so perfect! i love her 😭
Why is no one curious about what happened to the psychic twins
you people are the opposite of respectful when it comes to spirits and i genuinely hope you realize that sooner rather than later
CHASEMANS PARK NXT
STOP letting people hold you to who you use to be. You do NOT need their permission to change, grow & let go. 💕
I am so blessed to have Shane back in my life. Everyone has a past they're not proud of, but it's even more inspiring when you grow to be a better you. Shane, TYSM for curing my depression after chemo. <3 I love you! You've been gone far too long.
❤️ you Shane and glad you back.😊
Who’s the girl at 10:12?
Rylands dad is so funny omg
Can we talk about how sweet grandma is 🥺 she literally stayed home bc she thought she was going to slow them down 🥺
I missed watching these i missed you
18:37
ok i need part 3!!!!! 😍😍
I love rylands dad
Anyone else constantly checking for a new update? Cuz same
Ryland’s parents are hilarious! Can they adopt me?! Haha.
I've honestly missed you ... thank you for coming back 🥰
"Those are house settling noises."   Ryland's Mom 2018 🤣🤣🤣
Shane u should probably check on garret
When you gonna post part three <3
Yay, thank you Shane.
I wanna go ghost hunting with you guys!
we aint forget or forgave, begone p3d0
Morgan saying “aspiration” I think it’s apparition😂
Me and my friends went to third bridge and it was the most unsettling thing I've ever experienced and genuinely thought my life was possibly in danger when we walked too close.
Never got the notification for this 😭
I’m sorry but can internet psychics just like stop
YES UR BACK😁
i just relapsed and needed something to make me feel not crazy
So happy your back
I feel at home again 😌
Welcome back!
California is a big state. It's not all toxic, lol.
Rylands dad is so precious
Grandma is the best! I love her!!
I’m a psychic medium and I’ve seen at least 5 people who are attached to your energy. You have such a big personality and energy that spirits can be drawn to someone like you. You help them feel something. Being dead feels almost like an anxiety attack or paralysis. The living can help mend their pain and hurt and give them the chance to be around positive people and energy .
How did this guy get back on youtube and monetized again? I thought he was cancelled
I love grandma
I took my prom pictures at chessman and I literally NEVER knew about this???? Whatttt???
Rylands dad ain't wrong about California. I live in sac and it's toxic lol
OMG THE ANNOYING ORANGE IS BACK !!!!
When they said chessmen park  I hear chisme park  Lol 😂
I live in Denver Colorado and have gone to both the 3rd bridge and Cheeseman Park. Both are very very serious places not to be messed with. I absolutely loved this video, because I can completely relate to all of this.
The house is settling.. 😳😅 Umm. 🤔 😬
I wonder why everyone acted like they've never sinned when shane got canceled?
morgan is hot idc
Never,ever second guess yourself! Those who love you, will always love you! We literally cried when you posted! You are definitely loved! The haters are just so sad and hateful
Yes collab with Kendall Rae either on a video or go on her podcast 😊👏🏼
Is this new character’s ryland’s dad?
It’s be so cool if you teamed up with Kendall for a viddddd ✨✨💞💞💞💞
Can't WAITTT
I missed you so much 🥺😭
Rylands mom looks so pretty with long hair.
rylands dad rlly tells it like it is and i love it , more of that pls
OH HOW IVE MISSED YOU <3
WHOO HOOO YOUR BACK IVE MISSED THE SCARY VIDS
Ugh this brings back memories from your old videos thanks for making me smile Shane:))
Living for this series!! Been watching you forever and I moved a few blocks to cheesman park 2 years ago. Very cool to see all this stuff so close to where I live!
This is offensive and cheesy :(
I love you documentary content but holy cow cut down on the filler. You cling to it too much. That was 2 videos and you haven't even left the house.
The editing in this video is absolutely amazing. Great job! It’s nice to see Shane back ❤️
The whole comment section is Morgan simps
Why are you back? You shouldn’t have come back. Your actions are unforgivable and coming back is gonna cause so many issues for the people you traumatized.
I needed this,its been a bad day.
I missed you so much shane,ryland,morgan!!! No more hiatus!!!
Please let us know your new posting schedule when you know😊
SHANE i literally have been hearing rumors around my home town (parker) that you live here? can you like clear this up cause I doubt you got rid of your beautiful home to live in this shithole
My crush for Morgan I bigger then ever
SHANEEE
Omg stop I missed you guys sm
So glad you’re back Shane !!
Me hiding in the comments
I saw Shane posted a video and stopped what I was doing lmaoo
ew
Anyone know when the next video is up ? X
love you shane
watching the part of the video where's their talking about the tribes being framed and it's all spooky and then boom (sour cream commercial followed by a foreign candy one)😭😂😂😂
I had a demon experience once and ever since then I became a Christian and I have flash backs of that moment and sometimes I feel the presence, I also had sleep paralysis.. I cried so much after that
IM SO GLAD YOURE BACK SHANE
2000 bodies are remained buried there… A little bit out of touch considering over 2000 bodies of children were recently found in Canada at residential schools … yikes
Wait, two parts and they still haven't left the house...
Ryland's Dad is a whole mood too 🤣
When shane says "this is why I moved here. Family." That's a mood
So glad ur back doing videos. 💕 my sister & I missed you, been watching you from the very first video & have seen u grow & even help us though life. (Weird? Maybe but true) so thank you
So some weird shit happened while watching Shane’s series… I was watching it while working and literally my computer completely shut down out of nowhere. I thought it was so weird at the time but thought oh maybe it just glitched, too much was running. Now I’m convinced it’s from watching the series during it 🥺
:)
LOL Ryland Phahahahaha “she wouldn’t hear them coming!” LOL
Shane and Rylands move to Colorado was much needed for quite some time! I love seeing how happy he is since the move!
Bruce: being in California is toxic Me: Same Bruce same.
Omg YES BRING KENDALL RAE
Omg YES BRING KENDALL RAE
YOU’RE BACK!! Thank GOOODNESS!! 🥳🥳🥳
Morgan marry me pls ily
Bro fr just leave yt
SHANE you guys should come to Indiana and go to gypsys grave yard! Or stage coach road that’s haunted by Gypsy’s! Or the abandoned insane asylum or we even have a hill that apparently spirits push your car up and if you put baby powder on the hood of your car you see handprints. There’s a haunted tunnel too. There’s a lot of creepies in Indiana 😬
Fantastic, well done. Can’t wait for the last segment
I want rylands parents to be my parents! 😍😫
pffffttt duude ive been there like a 1000 times and mostly at night and never suspected a thing
Who watches u anymore. Unsubscribed
I was so excited for this video until it started and I realized they aren’t in CA anymore. It’s based in Colorado now AND I LIVE THERE
This episode was a bit boring too much talking. Hopefully next one is better
When is Part 3
Please do a collab with Colby and Sam PLEASE !!!! 💕
I have never been happier then when he came back
Bruh idc I missed him
So excited!!😍❤️❤️❤️
Yo the annoying orange is back???? wtf
Ryland’s dad 😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
yesss I'm so excited to watch this!💗
LEAK TO THE THIRD VIDEO IN THE SERIES!!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6cM36Cm27U&t=112s
Oh my gosh I was supposed to get married in Cheeseman park! Glad I decided on a destination wedding.
We ain’t forget
I love that Morgan is giving straight facts for our native community so thank you. Anyway when you hear drums in the woods it's called drum lady. They are trying to help the spirits cross over so it's very spiritual an you have to be very respectful.
I lived at Murphy Creek in Aurora and our home was absolutely haunted. The stories my husband and I have from our time there are very scary.
I cant even explain how much comfort they bring me ❤️
These videos are so long and boring, they're not what they used to be. Half of it's made up of talking about a park you're not even going to. Skip the dull bits and just cut to the action ffs.
i cant get over how fucking good morgan looks
Yessss love these videos
On one hand I like this, but on the other, it seems sooo overacted with the 'awkward' 'scared' and 'sensitive' parts... Also a bit slow paced and over dramatic, at times
Good gawd Shane how tall are you? Why did I always think you were on the shorter side? Your towering over everyone…in a good way
Get!! the hell!!! off!! the!!! Internet!!!!!!
Your comeback is not a Trainwreck.  Your content is not bad it's amazing. Do not listen to these awful people in their videos. They are only doing them with your name in the title for clicks. You're great and a lot of us are so happy to see you back. WE'VE MISSED YOU!
Shane, you’re amazing. ❤️
Grandmas says what when Shane says “do you think it was a mistake for us to move here?” Grandmas looks at ryland and says what, then explains. As Shane adds “really?” *in the same pitch* grandma finishes with “yes really.” 😂 seems like she didn’t wanna answer
Love this video! Omar's an awesome guy and YouTuber you should collab with him ❤️
New camera man? :0
1. Halloween 1978  2. Halloween 2018  3. Halloween H20  4. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers  5. Halloween ll 1981  6. Halloween Kills  7. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers  8. Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers  9. Halloween Rob Zombie 1  10. Halloween Resurrection  11. Halloween Rob Zombie 2  12. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch     Where I predict Halloween Ends: above Halloween kills. If there is more suspense, had a satisfying ending to the trilogy, great showdown, no bad dialogue and stalk scenes then it’ll be 2nd
So glad you’re back Shane♥️♥️♥️. Love to you, Ryland and whole family 🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️
I hate the camera moving so much, gives me motion sickness.
I’ve missed you, please never be cancelled again 🥺
Missed you !!
They should definitely got to Riverdale Road here in Colorado
Yay for mentioning Kendall Rae!!!! Love her so much ❤️😭
when you turned into a drinking game on tiktok
Leave youtube
The grandma’s just happy to be included 😂😂😂 i love her
Never left u Shane. have been here since 2008 and will always be here. I can’t tell u how much I have missed u, but I can tell u anyone that has been here since the beginning, never left either.
shaaaaneeeeee🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
OH F*CK YES SHANE IS BACKK WITH CONTENT!!!!!!!
Yo Shane i gotta great vid idea there's dis person on YouTube called Alison Quinn itsa kinda weird channel but he keep on leaving his channel I think u should try to get a interview wit him and see wut he been up to 🤷‍♂️
I've missed seeing your videos pop up on my suggested, so happy your back!
Hey.... Im Arapaho lol .
<3
Can yall please get Grandma hearing aids LOL She missing out on all the fun She wants to laugh too❤
I hate that you are back, you do not deserve a platform. The things you have done and said are disgusting and inhumane
The way that one lady described the spirit that is following Shane, is literally the description of the spirit me and all my old friends saw at the same time in my basement.  We saw a tall African American man in a trench coat with a top hat
8:00 “Mom knocks on the door while opening it” That honestly reminds me of that Fairly Oddparents internet episode where all the parents are like,” “Oh *insert name!* I’m respecting your privacy by knocking but asserting my authority as your father by coming in anyway!!”
my shit won’t play
Ope we love the cinematic beginning 😏
Ur still gay
Ahhhhhhmazing
HE'S BACK- HOLY SHIT.  I CAN'T EXPRESS THIS ABOUT OF HAPPINESS.
what the fuck his back
OMG MORGAN IS SO BEAUTIFULLLLLLL like she looks so good!!
Finally Shane is back..!!!! U have been missed ♥️
Shane is such a great editor!
We love you Shane keep posting ! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I’m sooooo glad Shane is back! We’ve missed these Kind of videos!!!
Love your videos!!!
I used to live in Aurora. I visited 3rd bridge a few times. I never saw any ghosts or heard any voices or screaming. But I did hear the drums. It was very weird and very creepy. There is basically nothing for miles except a few spread out houses. I have no idea what would have caused the noise .
FUCK YEA HES BACK
20:30 🤣🤣🤣 he was a little extra opening that damn drink! Is he sponsored for that?
wait who's the new camera man??
Morgan is the baddest b 😍
“Did you guys know that the annoying orange is back??🙂” 💀💀
i miss u so much shane i needed u sooo much love u always 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
Go back to the hole you were hiding in… shane🤮
the school vandalism trend is kids acting out because they are so angry and confused and isolated after a horrible political climate and devastating social issues being pushed aside.. it’s similar to toddlers having tantrums when they are over hungry or over tired, or feel slighted. the psychological impact of covid & recent issues is already being presented and will only get worse if the kids are blamed for not knowing how to deal with these big feelings.
How did I not get a notification about this?!!!   I stopped looking after so long had gone by but I was watching Ryland’s vlog and thank you Jesus this was recommended.. welcome back Shane we missed you so much!!
these comments are giving me whiplash
Grandma "I'll be seeing ya" Shane "in the afterlife" Ryland "SHANE"😂🤣😅
bruce being angry about the stupid trends these dumb kids are doing now!! i feel the same waaaaaaay. i have so many teacher friends and these trends are making their lives miserable 😔😔😔 there was one about slapping teachers too!!   ryland about things following shane. "what? ghosts? demons? me?"  LOL 😂
Thought of you and went back to your channel yes
Ryland’s dad is a whole mood 🤣
I love how I've seen all the 2018 videos Shane showed in this video over 15 times already
I can't believe this came out 5 days ago and I missed it! Must watch 5x to make it up to Shane ❤❤❤
Them talking about the devious licks are sending me 😭
Where’s garret 🥺
YES!!!!!!!! finally jesus
Ok boo please tell me there’s another series already filmed or being filmed or at least in the works!!!!
Yessssssss
Ahhhh omg bishhhhh i missedddd youuuuuuuuuuu
Where is part 3 Shane??!?!
the way morgan told the story was so interesting
So glad you’re back! Super proud of you ❤️ love you always
Highlight of this video: Morgan is gorgeous, bye ✌🏼
I’m so happy to see Shane again! We need some more conspiracy videos
Dude: *licks battery* “Ugh.. it’s dead” I can’t. Idk why that killed me 😂😂😂
How does Shane still get millions of views when he left for a year? Just wrong
Morgan 😍 my YouTube crush!
Finally took you long enough
California is toxic.  Honestly WA state is getting there.  I was born and raised in this WA town but we moved to a small conservative farm town about thirty minutes away. The difference is insane.   There’s something about small towns. Happy to raise my family here.
Glad you're back, I believe you've changed your ways.
Why are  you  and your  friends  so cute 😍
Does anyone else get like an uneasy feeling while watching this vid? Like something dark and desperate
I was so confused with the video cause I live nearby the actual Sandcreek massacre site, where there is even a memorial site for all the lives that were lost in that massacre. There is even a town called Chivington CO that was named after the general who led the massacre. So I was so confused, like why would they go to Arapahoe County up in Denver when they died in like Kiowa and Bent Counties, but it all makes more sense now. I loved this video because it brought out so much of that crazy Colorado history that only Coloradans know.
you know, I'm glad he's back. what he did was wrong, but he took accountability and changed his actions, he's apologized, and his actions are speaking louder than words. racism, sexism, and predatory behavior is not okay, but the world of comedy used to be a dark place for every comedian that's existed. this video made me happy and I'm glad he's changed, and I definitely enjoy your content shane. much love ❤
Their family is so like mine. Lolol
I’ve been a fan of Shane Dawson for years!! I still am a fan. But it’s sad seeing how many true fans he had out of 27 mill, only 2 mil still watch.  I love him unconditionally but this is a good lesson to other youtubers, I understand taking breaks but if you’re gone for a long time YOU WILL lose followers. There is loyal fans out there who wait for your videos to drop, it’s the highlight of their week. When you take that away from them. They lose their feelings. I’ve lost some of mine, just waiting forever. Your fans give you a platform for entertainment. It’s a job. You can’t just leave when you want and except the same pay. Really hurts knowing  he made a bunch of money off his fans then leaves for a year with no explanation. Even just a few videos to please the true fans that love him unconditionally would have helped his following GREATLY. I love you Shane Dawson!! Just please don’t leave again. Don’t let what others say distract you from pleasing your true fans. Do what makes you happy!!
Keep up the good work Shane you are so appreciated 😍😍😍😭😭😭😭
I love this video because it’s spooky and I live in Colorado and I also love Kendall Rae 😭❤️
I miss you ssssooooo much im so happy you’re back 😩❤️
the flashback to Morgan and Shane in 2018 felt like a fever dream
We are so fucking glad your back! ❤
He needs to be held accountable
Go away Shane
Shane. We are waiting for the final part.
Shane I get so excited for when your content and Rylands as well. Keep doing what you guys do best and make us laugh. Best wishes and we don’t care if it’s 2 hours I know I will be watching it.
When is the next video coming out?
i missed you so so much
Don’t come back, you’ve learned nothing. You’re just trash now
morgan is so pretty she's changed sm .
Morgan is so pretty
Lmao I live in colorado and love Cheeseman park! Ryland's dad is right though, it's creepy at night
All the signals to stay away and white people are like “ohhhhh drums”
i still like u content shane
but i mean he also did all those things in da past so that dosent forigive it but hes grown more a s a person
I know that he did some fucked up shit and its unforgiveable but THIS SHIT GOOOD MAN
Shane stay off YouTube forever please
Your back??? YAY
Stop abusing the dead for money Shane just go away. Jenna is not back so why you come Back?
Not y’all living in Arapahoe County 💀
Grandma is so cute 😂😂😂
This shit sucks it’s so boring
The vandalism is happening in Australia too. It's so annoying coz I just want to be able to go to the toilet without the door opening coz of lack of locks!
morgan looks so good
All of Shane’s past aside, this whole series isn’t good because so far it’s just been a cliffhanger and filler where he walks on eggshells about what he says.
So glad your back. These videos are the reason I subbed 3 years ago.
The king has returned
big ebk
Whole heartedly - thank you, Shane, for learning from your past mistakes and taking a more sensitive and respectful approach to situations, circumstances and events in your videos. It’s greatly appreciated and genuinely is the reason I’ve come back to your videos without feeling the peer pressure to join the mob in the cancel culture.
Shane: your fixing all our problems  Rylands mom: hahaha you wish  Idk why but that was so funny to me
Dude I don’t care who or what anyone says shane will be the legit BEST horror movie maker, his editing gives me chills!!
Just moved to Colorado. Guess Cheesman park is now on my list of places to visit in October
oh this was bold bold
I'm waiting for Shane and Zak from ghost adventures to do a colab on spooky places.
I don't get what is scary about cemeteries or bodies or bones. They are just dead people.
Why’d no one tell me he was back then huh ?
It makes me so sad that Morgan has expressed insecurity because she is so beautiful.  She is stunning, in appearances as well as how lovely she seem to be as a person. I relate to her humor so much and cannot wait to experience more content from her and all of you!
I’m sorry I love you so much Shane but that comment from your man about taking girls to a no service location to scare them into making out to them kinda fucked up
no?
can i feed you
shane!
shane
lee yee ha
I love rylands familys vibe oml ; rylands dad has me rolling and morgan is just- so goddamn pretty ❤️
So sad you're back!
I don't like Shane as a person, like I despise him, but I love his horror content soo....idk what to do
Love your videos! can't wait for the nezt part! I could easily sit and watch hour long videos. ^^
OMGG YOUR BACK! I MISSED YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I went to Denver 4 days ago and came back home yesterday morning. Awww it would be nice to see Shane ❤️
Shane i missed you
are you really that downbad on money they you’ve gotta throw in double unskippable ad’s every 4 mins?
me-ow
I miss morgans videos 😪
WHY DID YOU DELETE 300 MILLION VIEWS OFF YOUR CHANNEL? YOU ARE SO SHADY.   TOO LATE. WE GOT THE CONTENT AND YOU CANT ERASE ORGYTIME, TINY CHAT, OR THE WOMEN STATING YOU GROOMED AND SA’d them.   NO SURPISE YOUR “GHOST” is 12. PERV
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
im so happy you're back!!!!!
This is so off topic but Morgan is so unexplainably beautiful
I have been to this bridge so many times it’s funny that people still get scared. The neighbor with the gun is for sure no joke thou.
the best shane dawson video ever!!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6cM36Cm27U&t=112s
Great seeing you shane!
As someone who lives in the Midwest it was so comforting hearing rylands dad being concerned the same thing I hear my husbands parents being concerned about “tik tok bathroom challenge “
p3d0
heyyyyyyy shaneee when the next episodeeee
Keep it up need more
I’d like more Shane content and less cropped clips put together 😪
Missed you x
I love these videos
Not the creepy spookies😭
Rylands Gradma is about to make me cry lmao. My Grammy passed away this year on my birthday and I swear to god every time someone would say something she’d turn to the person closest and say “What?” Just like his Grandma. I know it’s not the same person, but it’s nice hearing it again all the same lol ♥️
So are we all going to just pretend that it’s okay for them to talk about the atrocities Native Americans faced like this? Like they’re not being extremely disrespectful?
i love devious licks 😍
The women who had 4 different husband die while married to her? Didn't Bailey sarian make a video about her?
Yall like shane? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euq72pFKBRw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euq72pFKBRw oh whats this youtube?
shane dawson x sam and colby?
Get rid of the camera man his laugh is annoying as shit
Yall really can forget anything bad a big youtuber does, what is humanity
I’m an accountant in AZ. Hmu Morgan.
Love u Shane!!
So happy Shane is back dude !!!
This is so distasteful
Is it a crossroads? Spirits walk crossroads. Like a portal
fr tho the tiktok challenges have been getting insane. Some kids are starting fires in bathrooms it's insane
I’m glad Shane is coming back, he should have a new change :D
Why is this the most confusing edited video I've ever seen nothing makes any sense pls enough with the jumping around
when’s part 3 coming out!
I was hoping for actually good content. I don't understand how people actually like this sort of "documentaries". The editing is laughable and Shane is better suited in the background of Rylands vlogs.
morgans whole run down about the history : she explained it better than my history teacher I be sitting there lost. We actually just finished talking about the sandcreek massacre
I missed you @shanedawson so much!😊😭
p3d0
Visit Waverly hills Sanatorium. It’s one of the most haunted places in the US. They have private investigations where you can record and free roam the sanatorium. The sanatorium opened during the tuberculosis pandemic as a way to control the plague and they brutally “treated” patients in many ways such as partially removing their lungs to let them “rest.”
Grandma is my favorite lol
Love the video! ! It's great and I love all of you! !!Shane iam so glad your back !! Ryland I love your parents and Morgan and grandma and camera man !! Much love ♡♡
This came out while I was at the hospital so this was a very nice thing to see when I got back <3
Rylands mom definitely has a thing for Chris
ew
You know what, i will not say it’s my job to forgive you because it’s not my place to forgive but - you have changed, i can’t help but love you, you’re so funny and your videos are the best on youtube by far, i see a changed man.
Shane, I am so proud of you for not giving up. During the times where you feel like the world is against you, I know how suffocating it can be. I can’t imagine  living in a world where people’s opinions affect my reality. I’m glad you got out of LA where people live with toxic lives and thoughts. No one knows who you truly are, so PLEASE REMEMBER, the only opinions that matter are the ones that TRULY KNOW YOU. The ones that love you and understand you. The ones that support you, not only through the good times, but also through the ugly bad times. The people that are there for and with you. I am proud of you and all that you’ve accomplished. I’ll be here watching you grow and supporting you through it all.  Much love from Missouri ❤️
Love this series… Shane I’ve missed you!
I'm a janitor at a school and there flushing the soap containers down the toilets (trying)
the way i dont belive one single thing about this ghost shit but i still watch all shane videos bc they are so entertaining....
I love watching your channel except for the camera shaking, maybe need a stabilizer or something to prevent all the shaking. Be more enjoyable to watch. Just my opinion. If your into film making.
“Everything follows me”   “Like ghost ,demons ,me” 😂😂😂
Honestly haven't even heard about Shane being cancelled. Was just literally sitting here all this time waiting for him to upload haha. Glad you're back!
shane someone said u so b1g that when u go camping the bears hide THEIR food
Anyone else have a crush on Morgan?
The “aspiration” of a little girl? I don’t think that’s quite right… 😂
So happy your back Shane we love you.
I missed shane so much i swear
Ryland's dad is so stuck on that tiktok trend XD but he isn't wrong.
I honestly enjoyed hearing the history stuff, because it's interesting to know about local stories and legends like that, particularly when told by friends. Great content Shane! Good to see you again.
Love him or not THIS IS GOOD CONTENT✨💅
Rylan : grandma are you gonna come ? Grandma : I’ll see you  Shane : in the afterlife 🤣💀💀💀
I love tgat shane is back yeeessss so happy cant wait for mire videos
Rylands dad is EVERYTHING!!!
LOVE YOU!!! You need to stay and keep doing u tube! This time..don't apologise for being you!! Your amazing and clearly shine so bright when your doing the things that you love to do! I have been waiting for you to come back..I knew you would after some time away. You have a good soul and it shines bright!! That is all that matters at the end of the day! Please!!!! Keep doing what you love and I wish you all the happiness. Love and light 🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰❤️
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 P/3/d/0
💗🐽I Went From Having Euphoria To Having Fear REAL Quick!🐽💗
is shane deleting negative comments or have people genuinely forgiven him??? im flabbergasted
I love how Rylan's dad is like: Shane! Use your famousness to get these little shits off our public schools bathroom!  "We will find out, really quick! " 😂😂😂
Morgan, you are looking so fiiine, girl! Love to see it
Is this the “third bridge” such a classic spot in the Denver area. It’s crazy how you stay here now Shane
Okay but why are they laughing at Ryland’s dad who is very serious about the devious licks? Like it’s not a joke. Shane despite being problematic has a large platform and following and could help. 🤷🏼‍♀️ But no, let’s laugh about it!   Sincerely, A teacher
Me watching this while sitting this at a park 👁👄👁
I’m so happy your back
the scary music is so annoying tbh.
I’m sorry but these videos are a disorganized mess
What happened to part 2?
the like to dislike ratio is scary...
Side note how UNREAL is Morgan
I dont really understand why everyone thinks Morgan is "beautiful" I dont really see any thing special yes she looks good enough & ok but nothing looks "changed" its same her she was always good. wtf ?  Comment section almost feels like Morgan paid people to comment this.
I’m halfway through the video and have skipped majority of it. 🥱
I absolutely love u shane I'm so happy ur back
Come on guys. This was kinda clickbait the house….get to the spooky stuff already!!😤😤😤💯💕
nobody wants u bk 😟
Third bridge is literally 23 minute from my house wtf
Shane hurry up 😩 I missed you and can’t wait to gobble up all that conspiracy/ghost-hunting content again.
BRUCE IS SO FUNNY
what was it that you said about that s1x y3ar 01d? " she's like....s3x. y " remember that?
#imissandrew
11 k dislikes, thats 1 whole more k within 24 hours, keep em coming!
initial reaction: why is shane dawson still posting videos?!!? that imma watch obviously....
Sorry if this is annoying but I need confirmation. First of all, Love Shane, Ryland, Morgan, and the rest of the Fam and thought these spooky videos are really cool.  Ok now onto my story, I believe I was younger than 10 when this happened. My sister and I got up in the middle of the night because we realised we hadn’t closed the chicken coop, we were worried they would be killed by foxes so we got up to close the coop door. While my sister was unlocking the front door in the living room I had grabbed the torch, turned it on and started swinging it around back and forth. As I moved the light toward the fireplace in the room I saw a white rag. It was torn at the bottom and a very pale bright white colour, it was hanging in the air covering an old painting of a garden. As I moved the flashlight upwards the rag got wider until it took the shape of the bottom of a dress. I moved the light and got to what I believe was below the waist before I freaked out and moved the light off it completely. But when I moved it back it was gone like it has never been there.   The reason I moved the light away is because I just felt it would be bad if I saw a face like I thought it and got a bad feeling about moving the light higher.  Can anyone help me understand what I saw
Well I mean if your looking to make movies you could definitely do the style of the creep movies. It kind of matches what you do already.
The scariest part of this is the way Ryland Balanced his phone on the back of a chair.
You know what sounds like drums? Ppl Driving across a bridge.
Are these comments filtered?
I am so happy that your back I don’t watch YouTube often but I always make sure I watch your videos. I can’t wait till the finale.
These comments are getting filtered heavily and it shows
They were killed 1864.TVD fans?
This is so.... What is this?
Morgan is soo pretty wooow
It’s interesting to learn something new about my tribes. I am almost full Cheyenne & Arapaho.
At 9:13 that’s what we in the south call “fuck around and find out 👏🏻”
👌👌 back to the gold, good job mate
Shane I'm all up for you coming back to youtube and glad to see you making videos but COME ON MAN! 30+mins of talking and half of it was totally off topic with nothing to even do with the haunted place yous are going to??
Tbh this episode was super boring, couldn’t finish it
Me thinking I could watch this at 3:30 am ahaha 😂 nope 2 scared lol
Love Rylands Dad omg lol so honest but hilarious lol love him
Shane, there are plenty of Native American massacres that you can exploit in California.  It's cute you had to come here to cling to relevance though.
Ok let me tell you a story about some “friends” so there is this girl who is a liar and I don’t wanna say her name because of some things she cause so it started with her saying I punched her in the face which is not true btw and we told a teacher (we were at school) he told us stop drama (she starts it by bulling girls with body shame(me)) I tried to stop it it was so hard she told her friends and made a clan against my friends she started more saying I looked at her in the bathroom cuz I knew the lock was broken and the cleaners were foreign and I stood in front to stop them then she told her clan I looked at them in the toilet and then she told the SAME teacher he said so? So this was in my hands now this happened today, she acted normal like HUH? then I told my other friend (that was her ex friend) so I thought they weren’t friends lol what a mistake I told her don’t trust (girl) which wasn’t the girl I started with she was worse she told them then I got asked to hand out the books I skipped the girl I asked not to trust the other girl and their book was the same colour and then the girl I asked her not to trust says “you skipped my book” with like the rudest attitude and then she said shush the entire lesson when I was try a get my friend on discord and she was like “your talking abt me” and I wasn’t- then at the end of the day they called me dyslexic and nobody loves me etc etc I was going to collect their books then their like “move on!” Then I went to the girl who to,d the mean girl abt me and she looked at the girl I started with and she she said “….move on…..” and I started crying and my real friend asked me what’s wrong and I said don’t trust the mean girl and she was like ok she started telling everyone then (the mean girl) and everyone but my friends hated me, and my friends so then I was like let’s be badasses and ruin her life so tomorrow her life is gonna fall apart. 😈- l8l6
Rylands father has the same eyes as the dog 🐕 Delighted Shane is back
LOVE THAT HE'S BACK! MISSED THEM ALL SO MUCH 😍😍 anyone else missing the old days when they did the series and all that?
yo shane tf is this https://youtu.be/euq72pFKBRw
My friends hate him, UHM EXCUSE ME HE JUST BUILT DIFFERENT HE AMAZING!
this was posted on my birthday😛
Please...I'm begging just stay off the internet! Dont taint your image even more.
Shane please do something about McKinney manor. This guy is effing nuts. I truly believe if the police were to search his property they would find human corpses.  I still can’t come to grips how this psycho is basically allied to torture People. And after they get into his so called haunted house, their screwed. It’s messed up.
Back again hm?
I'm glad they talked about the history of it, many people should know about what happened to indigenous people.
Hey Shane Welcome back :))))
Obviously the only people that think it was a bad decision to move to Colorado is Ryland and Shane. They’ve asked all their family members about 10 times and everyone says yes and they continue to ask so it’s pretty clear that they don’t believe they’re making the right decision.
I WATCHED THIS MAN FOR A YEAR HE CAME BACK WHEN WE NEEDED IT THE MOST ITS 1AM AND IM FUCKING WATCHING THIS SHIT LETS GO
No, you’re still cancelled. You don’t get to come back.
Completely irrelevant to your videos, you should cover the topic of the mkamey manor!
Shane still be pulling those views!!! Not bad …not bad at all
CHEYENNE-ARAPAHO HERE FROM OKLAHOMA!!!
I LOVE U
4 skeletons in 2010, nearly 40 more in 2008? What
Has Shane forgotten to post the finale 😩
Patiently waiting for part 3.......
trying to profit off of indigenous trauma is disgusting. yall r FOUL
Love u Shane and your family. Rylands family  is wholesome af

I'm so happy Shane is back and making amazing content again! I can't wait for part three!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Welcome back shane . . .
Shane, it would be amazing if you keep doing horror documentary like this. Make it a SERIES pls !!! I would love to see you travel all around the world to visit haunted places.   Btw, have you ever thought about making a documentary with PARIS HILTON ? I swear both of you would team up very well 💓
missed u shane :) so glad ur back to posting again! missed coming home to watching ur vids!
We've missed you Shane!!!🥰😁
I hope we actually get some content in the next part🙄😭💔
WHY IS THE MUSIC SO TERRIFYING?!
I was so confused, I was like is that Ryland and Morgan's mom?! She looks younger than ever!
Yaass
okay all the drama, put it to the side for a sec: CAN WE TAKE A MOMENT TO ADMIRE MORGAN'S BEAUTY, SHE IS GLOWING, STUNNING, RADDIANT, ELECTRIFYING, SHE LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD
Morgan is freaking gorgeous 💕
corny
What does devious licks have to do with ghosts? Also where are the haunted theories????
it’s disappointing to see so many people support him.
Yes!!! 👏🏻👻💯
so happy your back! Desperately waiting for the next video🤗🥵🥲
Ryland looks just like his grandma 😇😇
POST PART 3
We love Omar
Ryland’s grandma makes me want to cry she’s so sweet
I’m honestly just glad that you’re back
POV: Morgan just discovered the meaning of "kiki"
i needed this, i watched all your conspiracy vids already 😭
I missed Shane so much!! So glad he is back and get to see him with Ryland's family! CO seems great for him!
protect morgan at all cost
YO SHANE DAWSON PLZ.TELL ME WHAT WAS THE SONG U USED FOR THE HAUNTED QUEEN MARY SHIP IN THE BEGINNING OF PART 2
Omg I work as a custodian at a middle school and everything Rylands dad said is literally happening at my school lol
I love you shaneeee I’m so glad you’re back!!
Wasn't third bridge where the first episode of supernatural was based on
THIS WAS SO WORTH AN HOUR OF MATH CLASS ✨‼️
I don't even care about haunted stuff, I just love watching Grandma never having a clue what anyone is talking about lol
Bro at this point just call the winchesters
I wish your cameraman isn't talking and reacting as much. Don't really wanna hear him. Happy to know you're back Shane!
Who else wants to see a shane Dawson conspiracy theory of the coronavirus ✋🏼 that will be insane
Another mediocre vlog that takes forever to get to the point
I’m glad to see you post! Doing what you love ❤️
Cant help but think about shanes mom 🥺 where she at??
Morgan looks so fucking pretty I can’t.
Bro does this guy just censor comments or something?
Just gotta love how this was def click ain't and I re watching it
Ryland's dad is too much lmao
Hunters gonnA get their huntees
I have met that man In the black trench coat and hat 🤯 Omgg I’ve literally seen him standing by my door years ago
Great videos Shane, Congratulations on coming back to life :) Love you man!!!
DEMONS, GHOSTS, DEATH..  Morgan: Wait, did you guys know the annoying orange is back?   👀👀👀 *silence*   I love her 😂
The Idea of building a park on top of DEAD PEOPLE is SO inhumane and disgusting. Ridiculous.
So excited you’re back!!! Also I love last frontier medium!!! She’s such an amazing medium!!!
Ryland’s grandma is so sweet 🥺
just found this new video so we are watching this now :D :D :D we are soooo hyper to have you back shane :D :D :D :D please make more videos & stay please :D :D <3 we love you :) <3
I love your videos especially the theories kinds. I hope u see my comment lol
Cheese Man Park?????
All I know is you better be out there for this crazy ass full moon October 18th for the REAL Tea 🍵
I am so excited that Shane is back! This is amazing!!! Shane was literally one of the first youtubers I subscribed to! The spooky content is the stuff I love!
Omg living in Colorado and having Shane move here is tripping me out! I went to third bridge in high school and I was spooooked.
BTW THIS IS MY NEW ACCOUNT
IVE MISSED YOU TO SHANE
*JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU AND CARES FOR YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY EVERYONE*
*Jesus Christ loves you and cares for you have a good day everyone*
So glad you’re BACK
I <3 shane
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ILY SHANE !!
How are you still relevant
devious lick😈
this is like my 3rd time watching this I LOVE UUUU
CONSPIRACY theories
Ive missed you sooooooooo much 🥺
Miss your series ♥️♥️
Morgan should make a podcast
Your editing is trash. Please fix it or even fix yourself 🤡.
I actually really enjoyed this video!  Hauntings and ghost and the back story's of it all have always been interesting to me!
OMG SHANE 😭 how am I 4 days late to this? I’ve missed you and your content. Hope youre doing well. Love to see you back on my feed 🖤 Edit: wtf and theres a part 1 that i completely missed too?
You came back yes you were literally my favorite YouTuber and you still are never do that again you scare me for one year
WELCOME BACK SHANE YAYY!!😌👏
Yall switch up so fast bruh
you dont deserve to be welcomed back
this is white priviledge at its finest lol stop making content and leave
It’s a good thing I never participated in those ridiculous TikTok video trends 🤦‍♂️!
stop posting nasty
I know Shane’s been deleting comments cause there’s a slim-to-none chance that anyone with half a brain still likes him
Conspiracy theories pleaseeeee
this is so bad✋😭
I have never missed someone more in my lifeeeee
Rylands dad is literally me, I always talk shit about tik tokers, I'm a Colorado native and I also think California is toxic lmao
Devious licks😈😈😈
who tf told u that u could come back
I become so emotional on how heavenly happy you guys make me feel it’s such a delight to have you back Shane I will & always support you no matter what through thick & thin.
why are they bigger boomers than their parents
YASSSSSSSSSS REMEMBER SHANE, YOU ARE LOVED
you weren't forgiven, love 💓
you have no idea how much i’ve missed you shane.
got a post notification came here to unsubscribe ❤️
I hope I am that cool of a grandma. lol
The music was so intense
👏👏👏
Hey Shane, in case it escaped your notice, your old pal Eugenia Cooney that you made such a show of caring about is on a decline again and probably going to be dead within the coming months. Might be nice for you to check in on her. And if you're lucky, you might be able to squeeze some content out of her, too!
I’m so happy Shane’s back 😭😭 makes me so excited!!! Definitely chilling in my spiraling hoodie to watch this!!
When will the next one come out?
Never stopped loving your videos Shane ❤
Aren't there alot of Windigo stories in Colorado as well?
Love you Shane!!!
I know Shane's back and all. But why the hell am I watching this at 3am.
devious licks made the news
Dude this doesn't seem respectful... I don't think finishing this series is a good idea, or maybe send your monetization to a fundraiser that supports Native Americans (maybe that tribe specifically?) or have like a respectful educational moment in one of the videos on the tribe or I don't know something? Sort of feels like even if you say you feel bad, you're still making the video and getting views and getting paid for said views.. like you're profiting off of a really tragic event that happened to minorities... which happens to minorities all the time... I've been trying to support you even through all this "cancelling" stuff but this doesn't feel right.
I’m so happy that you are back I haven’t seen you in forever
PLEASE DO A PODCAST WITH MILEHIGHER!!!
9
God I missed Shane’s spooky videos! During the best time of year ❤️ I’m glad you have a supportive family out in Colorado
I didn’t get a notification for this until now wth
FINALLY
The thing that most of the pro-cancel culture people forget is that the majority of Shane's followers are silent. They barely leave/have never left comments under his videos. Though a lot of people seem to think that everyone suddenly went from hating him to praising him the moment he came back, the big majority of his followers never participated in his "cancellation" in the first place. They either believed in him or were too busy to keep up with all the drama. Hate him or love him of your own free will, no one has the power to easily change someone's opinion anyway.
The editing style is definitely different than his different series but I’m not complaining
OMFGGG I LOVE THIS
ryland’s grandma is so sweet 🥺
Love the haters commenting and feeding the algorithm for a youtuber they supposedly hate. You do know that all you do is force the video to pop up in to other people's feeds, you are literally helping promote his content 😂 - Y'all need to get a life, or a hobby - probably both lol
Welcome back Shane! Bring on the spooky stuff!!
👁👄👁
morgan is probably one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen In my entire life. I hope with all my heart that she sees this comment or some others like this because that girl is someone who shouldn't even know what the definition of self-conscious is...
I’m so happy your back Shane!! YouTube hasn’t been the same. ❤️
Also Columbine happened in Colorado, I’m not sure what city !!
Most of olde city and fishtown in Philadelphia also has homes sitting on top of old burial grounds.
who told you to come back 🤨
Yesss finally Shane’s back  I’m so excited omg n happy omg lowkwey having a fan girl Moment just because of how much I missed his content
The annoying orange is back and the Dolans are doing candles. IM LEARNING!!!
13:01 instead of being scared, this picture made me smile thinking how fun the 19th century folk must have had with their version of photoshop
I'm so happy your back Shane.❤
LMFAOOO YALL RLLY DO SWITCH UP
DONT STOPPPP CREATING 🖤🖤🖤🖤
lee ya ha
creepy shane
Those tiktoks videos happening my job made news because of that trend 😡
The drumming being a pump jack is most likely, lived out in roggen here in Colorado and the pump jacks used to scare the crap out of me at night so bad my dad had to drive me out to one and show me it was nothing lol
*When you get câncelled so you film an overdramatic, insensitive "documentary" about the slaughtering of an indigenous tribe as a return.* Stop filtering the comments if you're too much of a côward to face the truth.
people are waaaaay too sensitive these days, only reason shane got cancelled in the first place. I didn’t see anyone complaining back then when he was posting the skits they were popular as hell. grow a pear
I missed you too
Please, if you're going to use indigenous tragedy for views and your comeback, please do a fund for them, promote #StopPipeline3, and help us find our missing sisters.
Shane you really came at the best time. So glad your back and your happy. 🖤
Lmao I’ll see you in the after life *as he talks to an old lady “” I know he didn’t mean it like that but I’m high so I took it like that and I was like FAAAAWWWWWWWKKKK 💀😂😂😂😂😂
love kendall Rae
Shane making videos about where we all went for spooky fun in high school is trippy
go back to not posting please i miss it so much
I literally love how white people can literally do whatever they want then return to the internet and everyone is having this positive reaction
Did you guys see the shadow behind Shane?? I thought it was Morgan but she’s on the other side of the room. Look back on 8:59 💀
this video is so poorly edited it's insane 😂😂
BRUCE OUT HERE WITH THE REAL NEWS
How about a theory video of you being skinny
I love how y’all switch up so fast lmao.
My birthday present - I'll take it.  Welcome back!
I sell Toilet Partitions & Accessories for a living. Any schools contact me & I'll quote you to replace everything these bad ass kids have destroyed. We have install screws as well that can come demo what they destroyed and put new units in.
YAY NOW I DONT HAVE TO WATCH SHANE'S OLD VIDEOS
Where I’m from we call the rural area the boonies
morgan is gorgeous omg. i swear she is prettier every time we see her!!
is no one going to question that 5 minutes of this is just random headlines and dramatic music??
im sorry but there is a 0% chance that you’re *more* likely to get murdered in a rural town than in LA lmfaoooo. LA is so dangerous and dirty, you should def be more scared there.
OMG !!!! i miss you shane !!
Y’all should totally get Kendall in a video! That’d be bad ass
good to have you back Shane :)
I MISSED YOU SM
Rylands dad talking about kids destroying school buildings  Ryland: I’m going to need some more context 👵👓🤏🤳
okay uhhhh… i love ryland’s dad??? what a king
Only pretty people move back home to Colorado
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
“Everything. Like ghost? Demons? Me?” 😆😆😆😆 Ryland wins most adorable Fiancé award 🥇 in my POV! 🤍
I would very much appreciate it if the editor stopped over dramatising these. Whats with the horror movie music n sht cmonnnn...
In high school we went to third bridge, it was very unsettling
When I saw posted new vid I needed to rub my eyes I was so happy but so confused
Thank you for coming back <3
Love u Shane, love ur videos welcome back.
the constant unnecessary sound effects makes the video unwatchable. it's like constant car honking.
Let’s be real there’s dead body’s under us everywhere we walk
Shanes personality is cringe af
boy Just bring The Old shit back and give us some Damn conspiracy theories
Why did I miss this 😢
I love Rylands dad 😂
Also if you didn't care what people think then why are you deleting comments lol
I wenr to third bridge, we heard foot steps and when we got back to the car there was hand prints from steam all over the car like the car was on or foggy
Lol he deleted my comment   Anyway he literally just stole documentaries to explain the bridge and it's history his video didn't explain jack.
honestly, I love these videos but I think Shane needs to sit down and make an apology to everyone who he's endangered over the years by allowing rapists and pedos to hid within his one community. no jokes, no crying, and no jump-cutting. 3 videos won't keep you relevant forever,
I missed you shaaane! Low key you never left because I’ve been keeping up through Rylands vlogs haha
For anyone that wants to visit this place you should be careful. The property around 3rd Bridge is owned and they do not like it when people trespass at night looking for paranormal phenomena. Be respectful and remember that everyone in CO is carrying lmao.
morgan lol with te annoying orange thing lol
I love you Shane
1:03 "Aspiration"?🤔😂 I think she meant apparition. Lol
Thank you for coming back Shane. ❤
honestly i dont like the other video montages i feel like It's too long. Would love to see them telling whatever story rather than random videos from youtube
Soooo hear me out, Shane, you do a series based on local town histories, and you do like a visit for a week, interview and then ghost hunt? I would more than watch that! We could all learn about important (not well discussed) history, and we can call get spooked and better educated.
I LOVE that your back! 💕
The videos being more about family have restored the cozy, upbeat, familiar, intimate vibe from my favourite videos of yours :) glad it’s back to this
ShAne plzzz don’t go back to makeup stay on this bro plz
Rylands Dad is funny ahaha his awesome
So did that governor have that guy and his family scalped to blame them...???
Yo when is part 3
Loving this series
morgan is so beautiful, i love their family
To the editor: please that black background and dark red font is sooo hard to read.
they have to be deleting negative comments there’s no way lmao
SHANEE I MISSED YOU
A collab with Kendall would be awesome!
can we talk about how good morgan looks though
This is what i needed. Welcome back Shane ❤️
Forgot u were even a YouTuber.
talk about how you were profiting off of r4c1st merch in your store up until recently.....
Shane...I had the weirdest dream last night. You were somehow sitting in my kitchen sink, watching tiktoks, looking depressed AF
talk about how it was wrong of you to share a murd3r fantasy you had about a b14ck woman who called out your r4c1sm and how you still owe her an apology......
talk about how it was wrong of you to hold that poor dh. 0gs head still while he struggled to pull away so you could force it to make out with you .......
talk about the 1itt1e gir1 you k1ssed and how she's sti11 waiting on an apology ......
talk about Tr4v0n Mart1n and how you mocked his murd3r since you like talking about that so much.....
wait when is part 3 😭😭😭
The world was a wonderful place when this steaming piece of garbage wasn't allowed on the internet.
Shane Morgan and ryland are the best trio♥️😟
Still fucking cats?
Hey Shane love your videos and love these type of videos more, hope to run into you in Denver sometime
So glad you are back and with spooky stuff too! <3
Begone nonce 🤢
they should definitely get amanda raye on ghost hunting videos
ive missed u so much shane!!! your my fucking idol! ps. my dogs chewed up my conspiracy pallet the day you launched your coming back vid! how fucking weridddddddddddddddddddddddd! spooookyyy
“I hope I don’t die” “yeah” LMAO
Why'd I read his shirt as "spear-a-ling"? 🤦 Got so confused
10k dislikes and counting, love to see it
no one:    shanes intro for the next year: I've missed you
I missed you bro
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO SEE SHANE AND KENDALL RAE COLLABORATION 🙏🙏🙏😩😩😩🙌🙌🙌
You’re back! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bri I love your content and I grew up with natives. That’s my fam. Sometimes I just hate being white as Fuck cuz I don’t relate to be white as fuck. My town has tons in natives and I grew up with them. That’s my family and hearing this shit breaks my heart.
Yea I remember hearing about this In History Class actually. This is a big part of history
Im so happy that shane came back. He's really has helped me over the years with stress , because when i was i would watch his vids and it would make me happy. And I wouldn't be stressed out again I'm just really happy that Shane is back. Because I've missed him and his videos and I hope he keeps creating videos for us and I love the series.💕
i love morgan so damn much
Chris is so annoying
I missed Shane so much ❤️ he came back finally 😩❤️‍🔥
The editing is just too much
I'm so happy you're back shane! Welcome ❤️
I am Cheyenne and it was very cool to see some of my ancestors get their story told on such a huge platform. Thank you, Shane.
Wouldn't extra coffins be costly? Have to Google this 🤔
I want this to be good so bad but this did not need to be 3 parts like it’s just boring waiting weeks in between uploads
Here we go boys, coming back around for Shane's millionth racial insensitivity
I’ve missed you guys so much, haven’t been on YouTube since you left 😂
has anyone realised that shane hasn't been online or on the platform in a year and i am so greatful to have him back!!!
Ryland's that is my guru. He is goals.
shanes back !!!!
morgan <3
Rylands family are adorable!!
omg shane i missed u so much i m glad u r back sweetie
I was just craving your conspiracy theory’s till now this fking Awsome
I think almost all of us are happy to be here and having Shane back! But with everyone saying that he’s boring, the video sucks, or that the editing sucks….. let’s put things into perspective. Shane has been gone for almost two years I believe! Give him some time. If we discourage him by nit picking all these little things he may not want to get back into it… he’s just trying to get back in the groove. I think these videos was just him trying to put himself back out there so let’s be thankful and happy to finally see him again and get some videos!
I thought youtube demonitized shanes vids?
Fat
He really needs to calm down with these side effects
It still hasn't sunk in that you guys live like 3 hours away from me now. Hope you like it here. 🙂
You tease too much. Can we do spooky shit now?
Yep, went there as a teen. You can certainly hear the drums and I saw a ghosty horse with no legs. Shane - look into The Croke-Patterson Inn. Went there 10/31/2020 during a full moon, lots of activity. Dreamt someone was smothering me with a pillow and woke up feeling it still with FULL sleep paralysis!! It was insane! The owner said that happens a lot in the room we were next to, which the two used to be one giant room anyhow.
✨spooky music✨ oh it's died....like the massacre victims
Morgan so pretty while I'm here looking like my dog's  sh!t 🖐😭
omg if i get jumpscared with that skeleton coming from the ground ONE MORE TIME im gonna break my pc
Hi, I'm here. Goodbye now, I don't like Shane Dawson.
I missed u & ur conspiracies so much🥺
Morgan lookin like a snack tbh. She looks more confident too
You don’t deserve a platform. I don’t get why your stupid fans don’t understand the horrible things you’ve done in the past & pretend like it never even happened.
Shane is always scruffy and wearing old tshirts and sweatshirts. I thought he had money
Woke up on the wrong side of my floor.. clothes still smell like the night before where am I why am I talking to myself.
Came back when we needed him most
weird how they just let P3d0s come back to the internet like nothing happened...
"Children playing in the park at night strangely dissapeared". Yes, expected, pedos and all
Mmmm. Okay. But what does Rylands mom do as a living tho 😭🤣💞💞
Some criticism but this video lack a clear Story line the viewer can follow. It jumps all over the place for no real reason than content padding This series is about the paranormal so keep it about that
Building a park on top of a graveyard is so disrespectful.
The story about the Native Americans made me cry 😢
ele invadiu um cemitério indigena...
when’s part 3?
Casually walking on old cementaries that turned into something else? Welcome to europe, guys.
HE'S BACK? AND PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING HIM!?!?!
not gonna lie, wasn’t sure how i felt about shane coming back to youtube, but these 2 videos were good.
"I'll be seeing you"  "In the afterlife" 💀🪦☠️😂😭
The TikTok part, this is why I don’t like teens
Broo finally u back 😭😭😭😭I legit waited so long
Gosh Morgan you are stunning! 🔥
from a native american: thanks for laughing at our tragedys 🤩
Bruce is everything 🤣🤣
I have a hard time believing the top comments are real accounts.
LITERALLY USING OTHER PEOPLES CONTENT MORE THAN UR OWN IN THIS VID dude…
vid is rly all over the place too hard to follow
this feels like a long trailer the first half this wasn’t a good one shane lol
I’m so happy you’re back 😇 missed you and you’re videos so much
So how are we feeling about him returning. I have mixed feelings considering I really liked Shane before all this, but he addressed it. I’m conflicted
missed you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤️
Never been more happy in my whole life! Welcome back
So glad your back home woop 🙌 if I was you I would keep your privet life private and turn your comments off for every video and just stick to your crime stuff and conspiracy stuff and short movies makes life a little easier for you, you don't need people's crap etc keep every thing on the Internet strictly private and work based best way to be my love

More adventures PLEASSSSSE! ♥
Why is everyone just disregarding his past  it is not something that should be taken lightly and forgiven so easily
I love Ryland's family so much
i am ecstatic to see Shane back. i really missed his presence here for the past 2 years.
I remember how popular Shane's documentary was, people would literally wait for it and the views were crazy ❤ Quality Content
I will never forget what you did
Honestly  the best thing to do is do research of the area and make peace personally since Morgan did that you all could find a local relative with that Tribe relation   have them say a prayer  make an offering like burn tobacco plant tree do something nice  that they loved a powerful white man came and took  their lives and land pretty much the same with all native  stories there’s so much we can make right even if it wasn’t us individually the spirits will see that as a effort
if he wants to see crazy he should go see the aurora mall 💀
What the fuck. This is so unbelievably disrespectful. You literally know it is and then laugh it off anyways.
The person filming this has the most annoying laugh. It's so distracting and obnoxious.
shane is filtering the comments so there isn't hate lmao
I love ryland's grandma lmao 🥺🥺
OH MY GOD  I"M IN LOVE WITH YOUR EDITING SHANE
Shane’s back 😭❤️
Missed you Shane especially the weird side but if you ever feel the need to do makeup please do who cares just be silly you again love this video the smacking of the teachers is the tick tock challenge I  can’t understand that’s also a thing  did they run out of dances?😂😂😂 classic Shane ❤️
I love that he lives in my home state and is exploring the hauntings here! It's so exciting seeing Shane mentioning places I grew up with and explored.
So does anyone know when part 3 comes out?!?!
I actually might cry I can’t believe he’s back🥺
Shaneeee! I know I’m late but I’m so happy you’re back!!🥰❤️🥺
And now i go watch something that will let me sleep
You came back I kept checking your acc because I love you honestly and I missed you so much..
why am i watching this at 2 am 😰😭😭
35 minutes of: - talking without saying anything - being disrespectful and having 0 empathy  - bad editing and extensive camera shaking  - staged "real"-talk  Who the hell gives this video a thumbs up?
I love you shane! Im happy your back!! ❤️❤️
Guess his career didn’t end. My lord
This video proves you have NOT learned, grown, or changed at all following your past bring brought into question. There should have been an apology in this video. Grow the f***k up and own up to your past.
Looks like Shane's reddit is the only things that's not having comments deleted. RIP. Shane's a big phony. Too bad people forgot that you're a predator. Never forget the countless people you hurt. Sad to see.
7:27 he spitting facts
LMAOOOO AND PEOPLE TAKING OFF TOIELT SEATS N SHIT  my dads a janitor for a high school and he said someone shitted on the fucking wall   And my principle won’t shut abt it that much and at my friends other school they’re only allowed to go in the office bathroom like the waiting list for that bitch is from Tuesday
he is back carefull he is a herooooo
This is nit how you do a come back after backlash for racism, transphobia and pedophelia... like maybe make a real video where literally anything happens?
Happy to see you back, but the new camera guy is terrible. The footage is so wobbly & unsteady & the zooming is too abrupt and loud.
Really going to talk about Native Americans and this tragic thing (one of MANY) that happened to them for nearly the entire video…PROFIT off of it, and not donate anything back to that community???? This is really so fucking distasteful and disrespectful.
So glad to see Shane. He seems happy
Honestly had to fast forward thought about 10-15mins of this video to skip through all the parts that just didn’t seem to fit there. Not that I don’t love ryland and his family but a whole montage before explaining the story behind everything came so late in my mind. Honestly felt that this video could have been wayyy shorter…. It just had a lot of fluff and filler. (Again! Love you and that your finally back!) The editing just seemed so out of place and clumsy deff not your style of videos.
Ryland’s dad is awesome. 😂😂
Morgan is so pretty and funny and a sweetie. Why isn't she married yet? She needs a good man that will encourage and uplift her. She deserves is.
Best part of the video is Morgan telling everyone annoying orange is back. Vital information.
Morgan is legit gorgeous
finna leave battery packs at that bridge
so glad he's back i haven't laughed in so long lmao
I've missed these videos so much. Love watching you do theories
Morgan tho>>
Awesome video love you all so much xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
It’s fun to watch these
Who else loves kendall rae 💖💖
"I hope I don't die"  "Yea"  LMAO
Morgan looks so pretty!!
https://youtu.be/LX4MXvb4TZI
This seemed to drag on a bit
Ew. As a horror fan and writer I am offended by everything you did in this, and the fact that you think despite all feedback your “horror documentaries” are anywhere near good. As a human being, I’m disgusted and offended by your general return and presence. I can’t believe you’re using indigenous tragedies for your boring “horror” fodder. Just add it to the list I guess.
alr so everyone forgot who Shane really is and went back to blindly supporting his mediocre content...cool.
It made my heart happy knowing that they acknowledged the massacre, our people deserved so much more than what they got :(
Too bad the content still sucks
I have a ghost around me every day. It's my dad
I wish I could go on one of those trips with you tbh :/
🥺🥺🥺🥺
PLEASE GO THERE NEXT WEEK
Yesss!! Welcome to Colorado!!! I hope you love it!! ❤❤❤❄❄❄ Thank you for coming back!!
i get what his dads saying at the end lmao
18:33 La Llorona 👀
This is so bizarre because we went to third bridge once a week in Highschool
Shane this is really not funny  That story morgen ( I hope I spelled that right ) Said a story which is about a sensitive topic  You should put a trigger warning telling people about these sensitive topic  Me and other people got really uncomfortable with this  Please add a trigger warning
Thank you for bringing light to the Massacre story. I feel like our stories were buried by the government not teaching these stories. We have the freedom now to bring awareness and research ourselves our true history. 👍  can't wait to see the next video!!! 💜🖤
These comments are so annoying lol
we don’t want or need you still waiting for jenna go away
Yk it’s real when Omar is involved 😇
an apology without change is just manipulation.
an apology without change is just manipulation.
an apology without change is just manipulation.
an apology without change is just manipulation. where are the reparations? we just go straight to laughing about dead native americans? gotcha. sorry but i'm out for good. hope you grow up someday.
Shane, Native American?!? How can we be native to a country that didn't/ doesn't exist? Please get it right soon...I like you but I can't believe you are still being so offensive in your new videos. Did you consult the indigenous people of the region before exploiting this story? I'm sad for you again. You must do better.
Y'all did Grandma wrong lol
❤️ you Shane and glad you back.😊
How are y’all in these comments saying y’all missed him knowing what type of person he is.
people are so brainwashed atp- LIKE HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT SOMEONE LIKE THIS-
I kinda want a Bailey Sarian and Shane Dawson collab
I feel so sad for grandma 🥺 I wish everyone would speak loud even if they’re not talking to her
Comments are definitely getting deleted
Do YouTubers run out of money so they post a video once a year to gain the account back up ? …. If so … I’m here for it
I’m pretty sure this is the same bridge the creature hub visited that one time.
YESSSS SHANE YOU BACK
I'm sorry but this was very boring. Especially the repeating clips and and the like 10+ minutes of just other people explaining. And then the useless part about the toilets and tiktok thing. Then you have finally an actual introduction like around 19:20. Then absolutely nothing happens no one goes to the bridge or park and the acting was really bad. It's really hard to watch through fully without dozing off or distracting yourself with something else. I hope everyone has a great day and share your opinions. (Also not really against the video but taking a girl or boy to the woods with no service so they would make out with you is creepy, sounds like something a serial killer would do.)
I missed you so much Shane.  Super excited to see the next two parts!
im native american :0
i would be so mad if i died and shane dawson does a fucking haunted conspiracy video about me
I look into the comments and see a lot of hate. Why y'all still here if you hate him? You could be doing way better things. And yes, I've seen all the videos and of course they were disgusting, but I thing people have the ability to change. It just makes no since why haters are hanging around. But I guess the saying goes, haters will always be your biggest fans.
My senior daughter came home and said this boy was ligit trying to carry out a whole toilet....
Is anyone else bored? Like it doesn't feel like anything is actually happening. I swear Shane's videos used to be so much more interesting than this. Edit: I'm aware of the drama that unfolded with his disgusting ped0philia- i just watched cuz it was in my recommended at 3 am 😂
Hello from Chicago Shane
4:41 that don't look like ketchup...
What kind of dog is Stella? Very cute.
Interesting and educating video. I learned a lot.  When you have a slide of text on your videos can you give us more time to read the entire paragraph. I had to stop and go back a couple times to read what you wrote. Thanks again for the content. Happy to have you back.
I can't say how much I love your videos I can't wait to see the movie you create 💗
Morgan is so fricken pretty ❤️
IVE MISSED YOU SHANE!!!!!!
Shane thank you for coming back, fight the cancel culture
So fucking disrespectful to native Americans.
The pacing in this video is awful. Editing was unessasarily excessive and the length was needlessly long. Drama aside, I was excited for your return because of your entertaining videos, but this is a disappointment.
devious licks 😩
I am so at peace now that I can relax and watch new Shane videos again!!!!
that camera man is forcing that laugh fr what the hell did shane say that was THAT funny..
Who needs history class when you have Morgan
Sometimes forgiveness is okay  But not with Shane  It’s disgusting to me.
4:25 my school closed most of the bathrooms in my school because of it.
You should do a Wyoming version of this and feature Jeffree star ⭐️ it would be iconic 🐈‍⬛
2 whole videos and still no actual investigation.
Still love you Shane .. been years man yeeeeaaaarrrrrrssssss
I’m so glad you’re back. I always looked forward to your videos and I can’t wait to see what else you release.
Wow I feel like they filter out all the negative comments because how is no one talking about how blatantly disrespectful this was to Native Americans
Someone get rid of this sicko
Honestly moving back to your home town after moving away shows GROWTH. You’ve proven you can do it on your own, building a business, starting a family. The want and need to be near to your roots is as real as wanting to get away from them. Your nesting and that’s okay, and I think Shane needs the opportunity to also prove he came move from his hometown and make it. Don’t think of it as regression, you returned home with wealth is so many different forms and now it’s time to relish in it. Just my thoughts as a lot of my friends have been moving back home and really struggling as well.
Kay why ess
People are still crying about shan returning🤣🤣 yall need to get off your high horses and grow up and grow some balls 😂
Evil spirit, BEEEEGOOOOONNEEEEE!!!!!!
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE!?
What the fuck is this, you spent a bunch of the video talking about the fucked up history of the aboriginals around there, and then went ehe jk this isn't about them though dw guys, but then talked about how you can hear banging of the native drums, like you're literally going to aboriginal land and looking for ghosts, how did you think that was okay how did you learn absolutely nothing these last few years, especially with the widespread  talk about what happened in Canada, I know yall are in the states but you aren't new, why on earth would you think perpetuating the disrespect of native land now of all times is gucci??
Exploiting and making light of a traumatic event in indigenous history. Real classy.
What is wrong with all of you
I seriously can't stand ryland or his family. ESPECIALLY Morgan. He was so better without them. Ryland since his podcast especially even before that annoys the fuck out of me. I can't stand people like him.
I mean i feel like i've already seen the entire finale through all of the preview cuts 😂
Why is no one talking about Ryland ?  The whole taking girls somewhere he knew they’d feel afraid so he would have a better shot at getting intimate..was.. concerning ? Like wtf was that ??

shane is BACK. im so glad, because i can also get merch finally 😫😫 im 14 (9th grade) and have been watching shane since i was in like 4-5th grade and have never been able to get merch, so im definitely getting some i just dont know his official merch website
Jesus Loves Yall And Is The Way To Everlasting Life 🙏
For the past week I’ve been watching ur old videos and THEN U ACTUALLY POSTED?? So happy u r back
why is shane dawson so untalented
Omg love this
chris keeps on laughing i don't hear them anymore 😰
UGH! I'm so INFATUATED with Morgan! I've always found her beautiful but she has only gotten more beautiful since moving out of LA. <3
Lmfao Bruce angrily describing the vandalism is sending me. 😂 😂 😂 😂 I love him!
Putting a spotlight on the high school vandalism is gonna make them continue it 🙄 you’re dramatizing it. That’s exactly what they want to happen
This is literally unwatchable. Just filler of stock footage and other people’s documentaries on shit with loud screeching over it. This video makes me watch to tear out my eardrums.
i live for shanes horror content
Morgan is sweet you will find true love
Was just in a car accident and I'm resting right now but so far I'm living for these videos! 🖤 Love you guys!
It's so good to have u back Shane!! YouTube feels whole again♡
I am so happy to see that you are back to posting and that you are so happy and ready to post. I can’t wait to see what you have for us and just know that you don’t owe anyone anything and just do what makes you happy !!!
I love looking at the dislikes so I can get s sense of how many people have something mentally wrong with them.
Bruce is right, Cali is toxic for them...sorry Ryland:((((
“its dead……….. like the massacre victims”😭
this is the only history i only listen too
Why did legit nothing happen in this episode? If you’re gonna come back at least make it interesting.
…. The fuck is this editing 😵‍💫
I wonder why shane has not uploaded in a while
FA+
i cannot believe he is being forgiven so easily, if you can forgive him somehow for all his passed behavior u still shouldn't forgive him for being a behind the scenes bully and most NOTABLY being incredibly cringe
Hi, where's Cheeto?
Not me having my quinceañera pictures taken  at cheeseman park 😭🤣
He could make a horror movie
choke
This is actually so disrespectful to the indigenous and those who were affected by this massacre. I can’t believe this is what you post after all that “accountability stuff.” You haven’t changed at all.
I love Shane and will never cancel him!
We're gonna find out real quick
Oh god pls no...
Morgan is Glowing, ugh I love her
& we’ve missed you !!
Not saying you guys should go, but Riverdale Road… would probably like to see you guys do a video on it but just the history cause I’ve heard a lot of wild things from that place
Well this is god awfully embarrassing.
"Everything follows me" checks twitter for 3rd bridge.
The like-dislike ratio is priceless. I love it. The marks the end of the cancel culture!!
WELCOME BACK <3
YOU ARE BACKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSS
why did everyone forget what he did
this is very cool 👍👍👍
damn i’ve missed this <3
So glad Shane is back. Missed these videos
Haven't seen Morgan in a while and she was always so beautiful,  but DAMN!!!! She looks stunning!!!!
“Can you do it Shane?”  …. Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
18:37 man licks battery
We just gonna pretend he didn’t laugh at a tragedy, completely disrespecting it, and then say he wasn’t going to the quote on quote haunted place due to this tragedy after covering it for 10+ minutes and profiting off of it? Damn, thats weird guys.
Omg please make a video with Kendall Rae!!
I love this we use to always go to third birdge when we were teenagers. I new this was the place your going.
Omg how come I'm just seeing this!!! YES Shane's Back! Waited for ever!!💜💜💜
someone lit the bathroom on fire at my school
Shane In reaction to the TikTok videos of students stealing soap dispensers,  "Did  they just run out of dance moves?"
I guessed this is where you guys were gonna go! I’ve been there when I was younger. Saw some weird stuff!
Need to come check out the baby graves, along with hanford, the most contaminated place in the us, here in eastern wa. We're super haunted here!
lawlz go back on hiatus <3
Third time watching this, love me some Shane! And Morgan’s got me 🤣 love y’all!🥰 so glad to have you back!
I love that Shane came back. I miss his videos. Always been a fan and I will always STAY a fan. ☺️♥️ I just love Shane's scary/hunting videos. Just like the old times. 😁😩 THANK YOU SOO MUCH FOR COMING BACK TO MAKE SCARY VIDEOS. I LOVE YOU soo much for that Shane.🐈💕
Them talking about the devious licks at school made me cackle 💀💀
Can you do a video on the Shane Beastiality & blatant racism theory? Thanks Shane!
Did anyone else think it would be better? I’m actually kinda bored
Can we please get more Bruce in these videos 😂😂😂
This is so bizarre. I live in Colorado and I've been to that park. I knew it use to be a cemetery, but I didn't realize a lot of the horrifying detail in this video.
did y'all forget what shane did or what
the grandma comments I cant
Love the dad TELL THESE KIDS WASSUP LOL
✝️✝️i dont claim negative energy from this video✝️✝️i love god 🙏
I hope the 3rd video is better 😏
when said "You're Watching..." i legit thought he was gonna say the Disney channel
Why does it says part 3? Isnt it part 2?
I missed Shane’s videos so much ahh 😫
HES BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im obsessed w this. fall spooky vibes w shane.
I’m super happy you put clips of Omar in this! He’s awesome!
this is so all over the place from high school bathrooms to the grandmas dead x husband,  to cheeseman park.  i lived next to for 5 years, nothing ever happened.  sucks to say but i couldn't make it  through the entire video  lame.
Haunted bridges everywhere. Been to 9. So far, haven't seen nor heard anything scary, hohum,yawn.......NEXT!!!!
morgan is literally so freaking pretty
Please collab with Kendall Rae and Josh now that you guys are all in Colorado!
As a Knotts Berry Farm Employee I can confirm that kids are indeed DESTROYING BATHROOMS and STEALING ANYTHING THEY CAN…. but ya know “it’s a joke”🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ryland’s dad look’s like Chad Michaels
I'm SOOOOO glad his back!!!!!😭💗
YAy he’s back pls post more I miss ur videos
I've learned more history, in this one video then I have in high school EVER....😐😭
Rylands dad is iconic lmao
So is the deal here that he deletes comments or are y’all that brainwashed
Mom and dad relaying the haunted...........not scary
Rylands dad is so funny
So are we just never gunna see them actually going??
Man I miss Shane Dawson’s videos
Aspiration? 😂 you mean apparition??
Hahah rylands dad 😹😹😹
This is very disrespectful to native Americans and as a native American its so messed up to laugh about tragedies....
Rylands family is so amazing. You both are very lucky to have such supportive people in your life 💖
listen i don’t support him as a person bcuz of his words and actions but his content is amazing
YES COLLAB WITH KENDALL RAE
Third bridge story is exactly the same as green light bridge here in Louisiana
New here 👍🤗 very interesting 🤔 God bless you all 🙏🏼❤️peace & love
Shane: gets scared of physically going to a haunted place  Me: gets scared of watching someone go to a haunted place
so did we all just forget or????????
Love you shane
morgan looks uncomfortable in my opinion
Morgan is so 😍
Shane, you’ve still done deplorable things for years, and you’re still not taking the right “Accountability” for any of it. Explain the mistakes you’ve made, fully admit to them ON CAMERA, on this main channel, and apologize for sectionalizing (can’t say the real word or YT will flag me) children in your old videos.
When you gonna upload again
I'm angry at youtube that even tho I have notifications for your videos, youtube just decides that it's fine if I don't see your newest video "on time". Glad you're back Shane.
Kids love to stuff the sink where I work with paper and turn on the hot water, put graffiti over all the stalls and walls, steal the paper stands, smear shit all over the wall!!!???  It’s so intense
I missed your videos! So happy you’re back! I live in Parker. We are close now! Welcome to Colorado.
The devious lick 😈😭
i missed you the absolute most💛
The editing of this video is the epitome of "I can't make good content myself so I'm going to cut up a hundred different news stories and edit them in an overly dramatic way". This is pathetic. It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad. Ya'll spent nearly 20 mins talking about the history of the place before even fucking going. That's not good ghost hunting, nor is it entertaining. If I wanted to watch overly dramatic and terribly edited news footage I'd watch Fox News. This is bad, and ya'll should feel bad.
Ngl Shane could totally make a horror movie and it would be really good, his editing is so creepy and good
Was the bang at the end necessary!? 😬😬🤣🤣
YES YES THANK YOU OMG I MISSED YOUR CONTENT SO MUCH THANK YOU <3
So glad to see Shane back!
Morgan had a glow up damn!!
NO THE ANNOYING ORANGE IS NOT BACK
something at 3:11 said “shane” 😳
Shane i needed this omg
hey, I live in cheesman park and this is bullshit. just for anyone who was curious.
hey, I live in cheesman park and this is bullshit. just for anyone who was curious.
10:16 Thank you for adding this music in… I’ve missed it. ♥️♥️
This is getting drug out lol can part 3 get here already. All this interviewing is funny and interesting but I ready for the action
Morgan is so cute
Yes ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hopefully we don't die😂😂😂 Grandma: yep😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/WwJuuG1w2CE
Tbh fuck all the haters and the people who tried canceling you. I love your videos and I’m glad you’re back. 🤩
rylands family is so youthful
I am a fan but with how many of my comments get deleted as soon as I post them, I'm starting to think that people are right about you Shane. Nothing happened in this video and you are probably gonna make bank, most of it is stolen content as well. And when someone points it out you delete it?
yall switch up so fast 💀
I love that you put @OmarGoshTV in this 🥺 he’s such a kind soul.
Rylan saying "we took our girlfriends there to scare them so they are more likely to make out with us" made me pause and take a minute to process how absurd it is to leave that in the video. Gross my dude. Gross.
Morgan forever
8:44 the dog trying to bite the other dog  🤣  🤣
SHANE SHANE OMG I MISSED H SO MYCH OMG OMG IM CRYONG IM SO GLAD UR BACK
Did y'all forget?? Just like that??? 🤨
God I've literally missed Shane so much🙌 🙏 praise God your back!! 🙏 🙌
Morgan looks AMAZING  how happy does Shane seem?!  Ryland’s family seem like the most un-toxic people to be around 😩😍
Damn dude no! I was so looking forward to the second part and it drags so hard damn…
😪😪😪🙏🙏😪🙏🙏🙏You have two hands.  One to help oneself and the other to help others.   10.  Helping others is the fare of being in your world.  So don’t be arrogant about it.   11.  Helping someone may not change the world, but it can change that person.   12.  Today I found that if you want to love someone, you have to bring out the best version of him by helping him and not by changing him.
Yessss
Is my comment getting deleted? I just said that I think this vid was not entertaining it wasnt hate
Im watching this video again while waiting for the next part 😊
Omg Morgan is so cute!!! I hit the like button when she showed up lol
17:11 HOLY FUCK MORGAN. HOLY FUCK
i love rylands family, they are all so lovable
i missed him so bad. i !!!
So glad to see you back, Shane. <3 BTW if you want some serious ghost content I highly recommend checking out the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, AR. It’s one of, if not the #1, most haunted hotels in the US. The history of both the town and the hotel is DEEP.
wait what i thought he was dead... bruh what happened to u guys
Shane... that isn’t just a dark entity. That is the hatman.
Welcome back Shane 😁
I never knew about that Native story... As someone with Native heritage, I really appreciate you guys bringing that up, and speaking out it. Morgan spoke so eloquently about it. It's just so horribly sad. The park that was a burial ground as well... Jesus humans are so messed up.   On a lighter note, I loved Ryland's dad going on about the TikTok kids. I didn't even know about that "trend", but I guess it's hip to document evidence of your own crimes now lol. He really believed you could put a stop to the trend and prosecute all of them. That was so wholesome.
The Native American drum goes to the beat of your heart beat. We play the drum to the rhythm of the heart beat. Native American here. ❤️ love u and Rylan, Shane ❤️
I’m so happy Shane’s uploading I missed his videos so much
Shadow people in hats are very dangerous
YESSSSSS
Morgan lookin' sexy in this vid.
Ion like this man but u bet I’m gonna watch this☠️
shane should do conspiracy theory videos again!
SHANES BACK BABE WAKE THE FUCK UP SHANES BACK!!! BABE??! oh shit i forgot. BUT FUCKING SHANE IS BACK.
❤❤❤
Shane is back and my anxiety might be cured 🥲🙃
Bet they're deleting every comment pointing out how you shouldn't have even returned to the internet. You're old news, Shane. You've done sick twisted things with nasty vulgar jokes. You can say you've moved on from that past but have you really?
Morgan is gorgeous.
Rylands dad is hilarious 😭
I’m a high school teacher and we literally had to put locks on all the bathroom except for 2 in senior hall. We just reopened the bathrooms last week. It was disgusting. They broke things, then threw used toilet paper all over the floors in the bathroom. It was so gross. I don’t understand these “trends” now a days.
I’m so relieved to hear the “drums” are an oil rig. I took my 15 yo aspiring ghost hunter to 3rd bridge & heard them twice. It’s bothered me ever since. (Summer 2021)
Anddddd on that note Welcome to Colorado Shane😃
The amount of support he has is disappointing
I love Shane!!
Can anyone tell me what happened to previous camera man?
I miss your mini films 🙌🏼
how have you not been arrested wtf?
a poltergeist park? yikes!
Morgan is seriously so gorgeous 😭
Shane start doing your conspiracy theory videos again!!!
SHANE THIS EDITING, you need to direct a film. I’m so here for this and you 🥺
I love that Shane is back. But I think this “haunted/ghosts series” just isn’t good content or at all entertaining. People aren’t driven to ghost hunting videos, we want the conspiracy theory videos, we want that series Shane. Those vids are iconic! The mystery and suspense made people want watch, made people want to delve deeper into it all and it was exciting and you wanted to watch it over and over!!! This ghost stuff is not it and they aren’t drawing the views like before because there is no mystery there, ghosts aren’t real! no amount of facial expressions and scary sounding background music can fix that.   How about a conspiracy theory video on “cancel culture”!!! Oh my god you would be the fucking King of all social media if you expose and destroy that shit with one video or a series!!!   Cancel culture is just plain horrible and needs to be stopped. And you can be the one who stops it!! You could literally control social media narratives, you could be leader
devious licksss
These likes/views prove that none of you actually care about holding people accountable for their actions.
This video is great and it’s great to see Omar and his friend get some more exposure in this video! I can’t wait for the next part!
I needed Shane back in my life, I swear this made my whole week
I Miss garret☹️😓
It’s so obvious that you’re using Chris in an attempt to replace Andr*w, all the way down to his laugh and mannerisms. makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch
Love the video guys
MORGAN!!! You look stunning!!!
that guys laugh is going to have to take some getting use to..  :d
It’s starting to seem pretty common that cemeteries get built over after time. We have many places in NY like that and they are all known to be haunted.
I need a Shane Bailey Sarian collab
5:23 yeah shane, remember that lol
Holy shit he’s uploading frequently
The fake that you‘re literally living a horror movie. I wan’t this lol
I’m literally going to obsess over his channel again and I’m living for it. Sorry Sam and Colby. Shane Dawson forever.
This is you putting more "good" into the world? This is you cashing in on fake news and stupid nonsense to make a buck. Don't worry, your sheep will follow.
Shane we missed you too. Never leave us again
When Shane uploads…  Me: MY CHILDHOOD IS BACK *grabs every snack in the kitchen*
I'm glad Shane's back but it's so annoying how the camera guy keeps laughing and speaking his opinion every 2 minutes 😒
Hi Shane, my teenager daugther end me miss you so match. Thanks for to back.
now do one about covid
I’ve missed him sm
I love your grandma.
I'm obsessed that he is back
We missed you shaney🥺 been watching since o was 13 Had to see the thrill when you came back !
8:44 Oliver is a jealous doggy
I need the new video uploaded like now !!! 😆😆😆
it’s so weird seeing like, news anchors i watched, places i’ve been, that i live near, etc. on his channel it’s so weird to me
i dont really care about shane’s controversial stuff  but i missed you and your conspiracy theories  you saved your bestie from russian or ukraine human trafficker
God, on one of my old phones I'm still subbed but dang first a friend recommended you to me and God now my YouTuber
I’m so happy shane is back
Im LIVING for a Shane ghost hunting channel
Shane i have been watching you since the very beginning and I’m so happy you’re back !!!! I love all your videos and can’t wait to see more 💜💜
Morgan is fine as fuck
Mehh…way too many news cuts etc…I know it’s been some time since he’s made content so it’s only natural his storytelling is rusty but this series just seems all over the place
13 min in and im shitless scared
OMG THE SCARIEST THING ABOUT THIS VIDEO IS THERE'S A PARK WHERE I LIVE THAT WAS ONCE A CEMETERY AND NOW PARK!! it's said there's still bodies under that park too!! This is so creepy!!
Oof, he's deleting comments calling out his sexually abusive behavior... Not a great look man
i’m so happy shane is back<3 we love you SHANEEEE
i’m so happy shane is back
wasn't expecting to see a Shane video on my recommended but here we are
This is beyond brutal
I’ll always love you Shane, I’m glad you are back and ready to prove your worth.🖤
Yasss we love Omargoshtv
omg this is crazy
I love the dads energy💀
lol Shane “family” haha
I missed you deadass FINALLY I have something to watch
Who’s Chris
omg i missed youuu
Grandma and Ryland’s dad are pure wholesome goodness🥺 Missed you Shane!!! Back and better than ever!
So happy hes back
WELCOME BACK QUEEN!!!!!!!
watching this in my car on work break people staring at me cuz of the bass in my car 😂😂😂 I feel like I'm in the movie theatre! I should have thought of this a long time ago lolol  (I have an amp and speaker box in my trunk lol)
that review that morgan read.... asperation... which has to do with breathing in food or water LOLOL they meant APPARITION. lmfao
Will you stop uploading
Doing theories and ghost videos are the best thing Shane ♥️😂 especially for this month
So excited for the final!!!! Omg missed you Shane
I missed you!❤️ welcome back Shane! I’m so excited for new content!❤️
So many stories it blows my mind, the energy you must feel when you go there must be unreal
Why the fuck is this dude back
did everyone in the comments just forget orrrrr
It’s weird to see a Shane video with not even 2 million views after 2 days and only 15k comments 😭
can we talk about morgans glow up from 2018 to now⁉⁉⁉
Thankyouuuuuuuuuuu for coming back.
Honestly Ryland's family is iconic. Shane fits right in! So glad Shane is around amazing-postive people who support him😊
This is giving me paranormal activity vibes
Can't wait for part 3
You’re so great! 😍
Everybody is talking about how good Morgan looks ( which is the truth, she is dazzling!❤️) but can we appreciate Shane too? He is happy and it shows🤍🤍🤍
im sorry but idk how people can believe in ghost hunting crap its fun for the scare but to actually believe in it like
This is awesome. To see them talking about some true history. I never hear people mention native horrors like this, so to see some representation of people that could have been my anscestors is for real touching. Ya'll are amazing for talking about this stuff.
*The Audacity*
WE'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH SHANE!!!!
:)
HE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!
This could have been one video… I typically love long form series and have in the past enjoyed these multiparts from Shane but so far everything interesting has been teased in each part and then amounted to very little. Kinda dull.
i also believe Shane is back to humble Ryan a bit for taking his spotlight and replacing it with boringness, im so happy shane is back
Shane Dawson Just Made YouTube Great Again!! 💙🤗 #IvemissedyouShaneDawson #Trending
we’ve missed you so much shane ! thankyou for coming back ❤️
ACTUAL creepy youtubers to watch instead of this clickbait garbage where nothing happens: Nightmind, Alex Bale, Nick Crowley, Atrocity Guide
Im also glad your videos are back to entertain!
I love the thing mentioned in the first 5 minutes of this video is the devious lick trend. Omllll
his content is ridiculous
Shane you should make a horror video with Jeffrey star
His video is 80% old news report videos
The editing in this is literally so fucking bad
I LOVE THIS MAN WITH MY WHOLE HEART OMGGGG❤️❤️❤️
Can I just say seeing them all in Colorado I feel like they can actually heal and learn to be better people
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Is it weird I just wanna hug Shane and squeeze his cheeks? I’m sorry , not really, but Shane’s face is utterly adorable. Add some brown floppy puppy ears and he’s a literal adorable puppy 😍 big brown eyes, his fluffy looking brown hair, an the way he tilts his head when he’s thinking. Reminds me of a puppy. I jus wanna squeeze his cheeks lol 😂 yaaaaa I’m weird ik  On another note.. Shane if u want a CREEPY AS HELL feeling…u need to come to Arizona an spend a night in my mother’s old house down the street. More specifically MY old bedroom. I got no idea what it was about the double door closet but EVERYONE who stayed in that room got heebie-jeebies. After I n my sis moved out my adoptive sis took that room. She LITERALLY put a big ass chest of drawers with a mirror an two shelves in front of the closet against the doors. Why? Because, like what happened when I was growing up in that house, no matter  if we LOCKED the closet doors before we went to bed, they’d ALWAYS be open by morning with either couple stuffed animals on the floor in the closet doorways or these old vintage porcelain dolls would be on the floor when they were kept on the closet shelves. Needless to say I HATED that bedroom. It was brand new  mobile home my parents bought an moved onto the property. So zero clue why it’s haunted. My family an I got a LOOOOT more creepy haunting stories if u wanna hear em
"Is gramma coming?"  Ryland- "she wouldn't hear them coming." 藍藍藍💀💀
You can’t just come back dude
Hi
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
i am LIVING for rylands dad
I missed your amazing content
Chris laughs too much on camera sorry 😭😭
Jesus Loves YOU!!!  John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life.  Isaiah 54:10 Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,” says the LORD, who has compassion on you.  Numbers 6:24-26 - The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.  God Bless You All.
I’m so invested
Wait Morgan moved back with her parents?  I thought she bought a house?
Who really scalped Hungate?
Morgan is so pretty!! 😩😍
EVERY TIME i see shane's black matte studded starbucks cup i SCREAM bc i have the same one 😭😭😭
So much is well done in this video! All of Ryland's family members are AMAZING! His father is HILARIOUS!!
Does anyone know when part 3 comes out ?
Devious lick be like….
If part 3 isn’t an hour long, I don’t want it.🤣
Shane, come check out Riverdale Road next!
i swear Ryland’s dad and i could be best friends 😂😂
Pt 3😫
I am the phantom lord who has cursed the land that they have visited and if they are to survive with no injuries then you know it's fact!!
The people disliking are honestly hilarious. You don’t like Shane?…. Then don’t come looking for his videos! Funniest thing is they are helping him out just reacting to his vids in any way lol
And sorry, but I cannot get over the disgusting things you did/said. Especially towards your own animals. As a pet owner myself, I just can't forgive it, sorry, not sorry.
20% of this is good content the rest is just Shane going 😧😦😯
Shane, I’m so happy you came back. I’m glad you didn’t leave us forever, but I am happy you had a good break to breathe some fresh air. Now please don’t leave us again!!
This one was really boring and mostly other people's content. Just saying. I thought *something* would happen ig.
so you can go murder there and people will just think it’s ghosts theyre hearing
OMG WELCOME BACK LEGEND
the devious licks XD
IM SORRY THE DEVIOUS LICK WITH THE OVER DRAMATIC MUSIC HAD ME DEAD BECAUSE ITS NOT THAT. Scary  🤣🤣
Well Chris, I guess u should have gone to the queen mary with them
Can we just talk about how beautiful morgan is😍
Why the fuck was this recommended to me. I’ve literally never watched one of these predator’s videos. Get off the internet.
Dude I live in cheeseman park and I hate walking my dog at night 😭😂
This video was great 👌
why is this just now in my recommended
This dude ain't arrested yet?
*The Ghosts of San Antonio's Train Track* You guys should look up that one
Wait, so is Morgan still living in her new ranch house that she is renovating? Or has she moved home again?  Someone please help me clear up these timelines 🤪
Wait because 18:38 took me out 😂 who is that guy?? Iconic.
I swear Morgan just keeps getting prettier and prettier.
I love Rylands whole family lol
I hope you take this as constructive criticism, but I think people tune in to watch you and your friends and I think you use too many cuts of footage that isn’t your footage, like the news clips and other youtubers clips.
Shane thank you for missing us but we missed you wayyy more!! Welcome back Dad!!
I guess it is worse places to be buried than a park.
I love how he came back in spooky season 🖤
Vicki Bruce and Grandma are legends! The best part of this video is the family dynamics and the classic shane humor! I've missed this so much!!
I have MDD and your videos always helped me when i was in a bad day and when you where gone my life was spiraling downwards too but through self love i am trying to get better and now that you are back warms my heart in a way unexplainable. Please never stop because those who love you will always be here ❤️
Rylands dad made the whole video
I miss the old Shane 😩❤️
Zyl hare
Jou uitgedroogte bok oë moet gaan skuit
Fok jou vissie hol
Haven’t seen Morgan in awhile.  She look beautiful.  Have more confidence in yourself, girl.  You look great.  🙂
Shane doesn’t know about the TikTok devious licks he been living under a rock
HI SHANE! I’m hoping there’s at least a slim chance you get to read this comment, I am so happy to see you back on YouTube. Your content genuinely brings me so much JOY. I have one request PLEASE, I really don’t handle jumpscares well. It’s not the actual “horror” or subject that bothers me at all...its just jumpscares that make my soul leave my body monentarily. I really want to watch your content and I’m so excited to see your new series but I’m finding myself watching it at almost muted level, holding the phone a foot away from my face and tilted away from my eyes and at 1 minute 8 seconds in tho this video I just have to stop watching completely. If including the jumpscares is an integral part of your vision for the series, I’m wondering if you could PLEASE PLEASE consider listing timestamps in the descriptions of the videos so that I can sort of watch around/fast forward them. Sorry to be a snowflake...at my age I should be a little braver but I’m just not haha and I feel sad not being able to watch your new content. Thank you 🙏🏼 sending my love and good wishes to you and your family from over here in Auckland, New Zealand! 🙏🏼
I’ve done some really dark things in Cheesman park.. at night.. with strangers.. in the bushes.. I don’t know about screaming but I have definitely heard some moaning. Go back to California pleeeease you are ruining my hometown for me and countless others. Just. Stop.
@1:05 Morgan: ASSpiration 😂😂😂
Devious licks.....dumbest trend since tide pods.
Why does Shane include so much pointless unrelated footage in these series it’s too much
😱
When you realize cheeseman park is 16 minutes away
what are you going to say when you go befor him guys hell is real you don't want to spend youre eternity in hell burning and saying if only i would have accepted Jesus as my savior come to his arms he is waiting for you!!!! i love you in Jesus name i just want you to be saved God bless you Don't have to respond just think about it he gave us free will so is youre choice if you let him in your heart and let the holy spirit change you life
I’ve missed Shane’s videos so much. This made me feel home for awhile when I’ve been feeling insanely homesick ❤️
I love Shane’s personality and spirit. Seriously loving this documentary
YAY YOUR BACK!!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
MISSED YOU SM SHANE WELCOME BACK
Did I miss part 2 o.O
i love that you put omargosh in this! he’s an awesome guy!
Can we acknowledge the fact that there are NO ADDS in this video. thank you Shane
Where the content???
Please get a new camera man 😩
I started rewatching this next to my pantry while making coffee (my pantry has given me the creeps since I moved in. My apartment built 1934 my suit was a dentist office) and my power went out. On the whole block. I have never turned off a video so fast
I love grandma she’s so wholesome
What a bunch of bullsh*t.
No hate but another boring video, I’d rather watch@Layze,At least I can have some laugh
The camera mans laugh is HELLA annoying honestly haha.
Holy shit am I dreaming 💕😩💕
I love Morgan
Poor native Americans they were just living in peace   Raping women and scalping each other. They were so civil.
You'd think with all that money Shane would get a better camera than 1080p quality
Shane uploaded a video? Time to leave my room and go to the big tv.
ngl i missed this i don’t care
this video is so chaotic i retained absolutely nothing
the fact that they mentioned kendall rae makes me so happy
Was it just me or was this so boring
not me watching this at 4am. bruh im lowkey scared
This video was a waste of time! Comeon.... 30h for nothing???? Shane...
My friends and I used to go on haunted adventures late at night in Mount Vernon, Indiana. One night we were out in the country and we parked the car. We heard rhythmic drumming just like in this video. We drove a little further and passed a large decorated Teepee. There wasn’t anyone at the Teepee and the drumming sounded like it was farther away, no chanting or singing or anything either.
Shane good to see you back but your new camera man is trash watching your vids is making me nauseous the camera shakes soo much got me thinkin he's got Parkinson's lol
Shane says something follows him, yes demon(s). I’m actually not joking. As a former satanist and witch, now Christian, people unfortunately allow the demonic in their life through sinful behaviors and other means. I also used to do paranormal investigating. Just turn away from all this stuff and get right with Jesus Christ. This is a serious message even though many will mock it.
Grandma being oblivious to most of the conversation is the mood. I am Grandma
W O W 🌠🎑
Also you should talk to omargosh his videos are crazy good he may let you do a video with u
Glad to see you back 👍
I think its great that you are all living in the same town again
We've missed you too, it has been great seeing you in Ryland's videos but now it's even better to have you back on your own channel
Just give him a chance
My altime fave kind of videos
Shane posting again just made my entire month
Yayy Shane's backkkk !
how the hell is there no more negative comments. how can anyone forgive this man and excuse his actions.
Fakeeeee
Why would anyone think it's a good idea to build anything over a cemetery 🙄🤦‍♀️
Go play in traffic Ronald McDonald
The high school my kids go to has had several kids get arrested for stealing urinals 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️So glad I raised my kids to be smarter than that. I'm sorry but who in their right mind would steal a toilet or urinal so gross🤮
rylands whole family is just the cutest thing ever omg
There's absolutely no way there isn't a single hate comment in this comment section. You don't deserve shit.
Rylands dad is Adorable
Hm am I the only one remembering that he was supposed to be cancelled bc of what he did in the past ?
Nice video. Looking forward to the next one.
morgan is hot. i just have to say that HAHAHAHAHAHA
Shane is literally the master of building suspense in a modern video format. So excited to see the rest of the series!!
We finally got shane back.. now jenna 😭😭❤️
off topic but Morgan is so stunning I hope she’s doing well back home
Omg I’m crying rn I saw that black figure when I was younger cowboy hat and coat and everything wtf I’m so scared rn
Glad that they respectfully acknowledged the Native American history and the tragedy that took place here, instead of just being like “ooh spooky” and not treating it with any respect. Glad to see you back Shane and fam! ❤️
Keep rolling Shane, keep rolling.
https://youtu.be/mM1iMBroN0M
My KING. I will always support you.
I hope I’m not being disrespectful for asking this, but is the massacre what happened in spirit stallion of the cimmaron? When the army charged the Shiyans camp (I think that’s how you spell it) because isn’t little creek a Shiyan?   Im just genially curious I mean no disrespect at all and my heart aches for what those poor souls has to go through!
ah so lucky I got a notification to let me know to unsubscribe lmao
Soo, Third Bridge is Karak in Malaysia
SHANE IS BACK 📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢
Yall switch up so fast. Man I'm disappointed in all of yall, looking at you Shane.
I'm so happy shane is back. We all needed this
whens the next episode coming im tired of boredom
seriously how does this garbage have more likes then dislikes he doesnt even remotely feel sorry for what he has done acting like the things he did was just a small mistake like oops i am sorry it was a small accident it will never happen again
How is he still relevant?
I’m so glad people are forgiving him and giving him a second chance ☺️when shane stopped doing videos i was lost. It’s was the only thing I looked forward too❤️
I can't with this editing haha 😑
Looking forward to the finale :)))) hoping for a the most scare filled one!! pull of the stops!!
papa Bruce is the hero in this video.
When did Shane Dawson become loved again?
Moragan explainig the history was immaculate!!!!
Maybe Shane could bring attention to all the trafficking thats happening of the native american women. I would love to see that documented and bought attention too  edit: I understand all the people who believe Shane may not be the most appropriate person to bring awareness to this topic however that's the problem, lack of awareness. the fact of the matter is, Shane is a storyteller who has a huge platform, and if bringing attention to this topic can stop even one of these cases from happening then I think it would be worth putting aside any discourse on who is covering it. Trafficking especially on the Native American community is so prevalent because the monsters who are doing it are facing no consequences because these women are invisible in today's media.
NOT THE MAN THAT RAISED ME COMING BACK!!!!!!!! SLAY US. DO IT, PLEASE. PLEASE. P L E A S E.
I just want to say I'm really happy you're back Shane, and I hope people reading this can just be kind to eachother or if they can't, just put your energy elsewhere, it's not wanted here and all you're doing is attracting really bad things into your life. Life is about so much more than what you think is important right now in you're own tiny little bubble. You'll live to regret these nasty things one day when you get older and then it'll be too late.
As a Native American, thank you Shane for acknowledging our history in your videos. Means a lot of the awareness of our horrible past
Missed you shane! love that format so much  a lighthearted vlog and at the same time spooky as hell I would love for you to do a video on modern witchcraft and all that comes with it some time
Love how rylands dad casually talked about the devious licks
So Happy Shane's Back
Onision Lite is back
Ur scaring the fuck outta me . <3 <3 <3
Go away creep
Of course I have to quarantine when Shane starts posting- I only have one choice- it's a sign- must binge
<3 <3
you could not have came back at a more important time in my life thanks you for always being there when I need
I’m happy Shane’s back. His old content he got cancelled over was disgusting but years ago he was punished for it and he apologised then switched his content for the better.
yesss the Kendall Rae shout outtt✨✨
I'm glad shane is back but the editing and music in these videos makes them almost unwatchable lol
I miss you too shane, welcome back😊
Morgan you are beautiful inside and out :)
In the first car seen a few mins in the camera guy says I’m sweaty an just as Morgan says something some boy says hello, isn’t anybody in the car as voice sounds like a kid
so glad your back shane!! literally stopped watching youtube when you left <3 been here since the start love you
Shane already trending 😳
California is toxic lol
Damn I watch 2 videos you just let us along man Now we have to wait for part 3
Ryland said “young girl screaming” I immediately started to tear up
I was about to watch this at 4am then I realized THAT is a TERRIBLE IDEA this is probably scarier than any movie
I LOVE YOU
Can not wait to see your first horror movie on the big screen one day
LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU SHANE
I’m so happy you’re back SHANE we missed you too. Keep doing you. You’re doing AMAZING SWEETIE
Is no one going to mention the "ASPIRATION" of a young girl verses the "apparition" !!!
Whats the skeleton coming out of the ground jump scare what movie is that from?
Woah wtf
I posted in your last video that I was so happy you’re back, I will die on that hill. So glad you’re back Shane life has sucked without you!!
Wow y’all really just forgot damn ok 👌
Idk though, the second Shane Dawson comes back to the internet I get covid. Coincidence 🤷‍♀️
Watching this at 3am
Shane, i still love u for no reason when i shouldnt so pls keep making horror vids
I thirsted for his conspiracy videos
Now all we need is for jenna marbles to come back too
Not everyone still supporting him.
It’s good to have you back… Maybe try and do some more conspiracy theories?
I feel like everything was just all over the place..the Editing, the content, the comedic relief. I know that it was supposed to be about spooky stuff, but i wish it was more clear lined and understandable. The topic jumped from one thing to another so quick and randomly that it was hard to follow. i am honestly just left confused as to what was that all about~ but i learned that teenagers destroying bathroom in their schools is apparently a thing that happens in america..so thats something😅
Pee Pee Poo Poo
California is TOXIC 🥺
Love or hate Shane…. The man knows how to make a suspenseful movie
I’ve lived her almost 20 years and never knew any of that and I’m so horrified, like I just want to go to say sorry and pay respects
I'm so excited! I'm really happy you're back Shane!🥺❤
I’m so glad he’s back fuck cancel culture
did you hear that ghost, it sounded like it said "i whip my hair back and fourth"
Dramatic intro frfr more dramatic than x files
Y’all just forgot what he did. Yikes.
I am so happy to see them all again. Morgan looks incredibly beautiful! Shane is still my sense of humor twin.
Morgan is a great case manager eaoooo😉
I’m so glad Shane is posting again I missed his content
Y’all are acting like nothing happened.Crazy.
Wait..what?  It's part 3? I thought it's part 1 last week
Morgan with the phatty 🍑 ❤️ (in the beginning)
Shane is trending, life is good again.
"Is gramma coming?"  Ryland- "she wouldn't hear them coming."
Yeah these comments are disappointing 💀
Welcome back! I was so excited to see new videos from you! I don't watch alot of YouTube but you have always been one of my favs! Missed you!
I LOVE YOU SIS AWWWWWWWAAASWWAASSAASW
Gun club road is a scary road
It's crazy how many people have gotten in accidents or killed around that area
I’m really glad Shane is back it feels like post pandemic vibes
U should cheer yourself up and watch the muppets. They were cute in the 80s xo better for your mental health than this dark stuff. Love you Shane! 😀 xo
Amazing content. Wouldn’t have expected any different <3
Who is the goth chick narrating?
Half the video was just other videos inserted every 10 seconds 😭 It feels way too jumpy.
Oh, and one more thing: Your channel is THIS big, and the camera person STILL seems like they're filming during a fucking earthquake?? This looks like something filmed by children ffs
23:00 I feel like I learned this in US HISTORY
ayo did no one catch rylands comment at 20:40 predator vibes ew
Wow, Rylands dad is iconic🤣
That was more like drunk history than a kendall rae video
So are we pretending like nothing happened and just accepting he’s back ew pass
What movie was the girl in the red shirt flying up the stairs scene from? I can't find it anywhere. Also, Shane I am so glad you're back!!!
I’m sorry 1 hour into the series and we haven’t even left yet
When Morgan said ASPIRATION… lololol I love her.
Glad you're back Shane. I used to watch you guys so often I had a dream that we took fireball shits together. *Shots. Not shits. 🥲
shane- "if you lay on the ground..." Rylands dad- "youll feel em"👁👄👁
Aahhhhh im SO FRIGGIN HAPPY, FIRST YOU MOVE TO MY STATE AND THEN YOU POST AGAIN!!. I AM LITERALLY SO FRIGGIN PROUD OF YOU AND HOW FAR YOU HAVE COME IN YOUR LIFE. THANK YOU!. I HAVE MISSED YOU BEAUTIFUL FACE!!
Tell me why everyone was okay with Ryland saying “we used to bring girls out here so they would have no service, be scared and make out with us” that is NOT okay. Why would they think it is okay to bring girls into bad situations, make them scared and make sure they couldn’t contact anyone? This is totally not okay and creepy.
I miss Shane’s mom
Im sorry offtopic but morgan is gorgeous
SO HAPPY you're back dude!! About time too hahahaha. Missed you a lot. 💞
I missed u so much
I love all you guys so much buttttttttt I HATE CHRIS'S LAUGH SOOOO MUCHHH. It literally drives me crazy😅😅😅😅 love you guy tho 😍😅
Bro the park was my childhood I don't care about of the body's burried it connected me to  one of my moms bf that was the best to come to me and give me a few years of  a bit of a good childhood of a semi dad figure. That day was the best and I missed those days.
The fact that this man's comeback has been praised by his fanbase just shows the morality of his fans. I think that in their eyes he literally can do no wrong and honestly that's scarier than if someone harasses and stalks him because they're willing to forgive anything he does it's 100% part of a cult mentality.
I love this Shane 🎥❤️
Sorry to be that guy but Morgan hella thick at 0:40
I’m so glad you’re back Shane 🖤🖤🖤
so happy he’s back :)
Shane and his bf are disgusting people. So are their fans
I thought this guy was a nonce
how are y'all hating on shane when you literally watch david make it make sense
what makes you think you can just waltz back in here like nothing happened
Is just me or Morgan is literally so gorgeous!
please make a horror movie.
I missed you guys!!
U R canceled
Did y’all hear what Ryland said 👀
Still on trending 🔥
Why the fuck does everyone suddenly like shane he’s literally on TRENDING like huh
Absolutely love Grandma!!😊
This may be the best video ever!! So glad you’re back Shane ❤️
Shane’s my childhood and I LOVE HIM FOREVER! you were never cancelled to me babe ❤️
I liked the Mila Kunis cameo
Loving this series 😍❤️😍❤️😍
i feel like shane came back right when i needed him. classes started back up again and i think my fbi agent might’ve unalived himself if he saw me put on my “spooky shane” playlist for the thousandth time while i do 19 missing assignments 💀💀
we ain t forget
1.7m in two days ooouuuchhhh 😐🤭
The NASA shirt!!!  Lol
Summary of the 75 mins so far:  Shane moved to Colorado
Js hit a lick😈
Shame there weren’t any underage or animal ghosts for you to touch and have fun with
ACTUAL legitimate creep content creators to watch instead of a p3d0 who made this video sleeping pill: Nightmind , Atrocity guide, Nick Crowley - they talk about it right away and dont sit on their ugly furniture with their extended family talking about unrelated shit for 33 mins
I missed you love ❤️‍🔥
Guys it's a predator, back just in time for spooky season! 😱
OMG SHANEEE @3$4$4@3 finally back!!! My life is complete now
I CANNOT WAIT! PLEASE make more!!
I’m so happy to see Shane back! I didn’t realize just how much I missed new content from him. His videos have a certain style that cannot be replicated.
Can we Jenna back tho?
I understand the whole build up part of it but damn this too was such a boring ass video.
Normalize cemeteries. Everybody dies
Whoever edited this needs to never edit anything ever again.
Shane, get off the internet. No one likes you.
I love that the students fuck up the bathroom. They go through hell at schoool so I mean
omg fine I like that your back but I’m not gonna forget about…… I forgot…
Shane you’re still in trouble why you pretending you’re not? Hmmmm
Imagine Shane having a tv show
I missed you shane!
I love how Shane edited it to keep the seriousness of the situation but allow comedic relief at the appropriate times.
Im glad you are back shane. I never agreed with you being cancelled
damn yall rlly switch up fast
Cemeteries are the LEAST haunted places. Not many people are attached to a place that they have probably never been to before, but it's just a place for their bodies. People get attached to where they live, people they love or things that hold memories. Cemeteries are not it, folks...
Aw the love in your family is real 🥺
So happy you are back Shane. Looking forward to part 3! Keep moving forward, your a good person. We all have demons from our past, don't let them hold you back. <3
More than an hour worth of content…and they’re still just talking about it…😒
How is he still relevant??
Yoooo
People that are STILL hating on shane just have no life and are  part of the butthurt generation 🧸🥂
Ryland and Chris have literally the same voice, that’s scary! Lol
Hey Shane, I am personally a Colorado native and you should check out Riverdale Road the most haunted road in Colorado. It starts in Commerce City and and ends in Brighton. There are many stories about suicides, murders and just the scariest shit. My boyfriend is terrified of driving down it because of its notorious deaths. I highly recommend it, but also warn you Morgan, Vicki, and Ryland to be very careful. Thank you and Happy Halloween!! 💀💀🎃🎃❤❤❤
Fantastic! Love it!! I live in Denver and it’s just tons of fun watching my fave YouTube people covering this! More more more!! Please have coffee with me in Denver one day?? ✨😊🙏💛☀️✨
Everyone makes mistakes, I hope his learned from them but I definitely missed him
I couldn't hear the info over that music, PLS.
Miss your grandma Shane🥺💖
i’m so sad for native americans :(
I love them ALL! They're so adorable! I miss you Shane!
I’m so glad Shane is back. 👻
3rd bridge has to be one of the worst places you could have possibly gone
Ok this really scared me lol it’s taken me two days to watch it 😂😂
did everyone just forget what he did
Welcome back!🤍🤗
A whole mood 👑 Bucket list: go around the world on a scary tour field trip with your friend. 🖤 Post a pic and caption reads: having the best time of my life retirement with my ghost friends ✌️💀🖤 who are low key planning to murder me and use my body as a vessel 😂

Please go away, we didn't want you back
I MISSED YOU SHANE
Not me literally about to go to aurora Colorado next weekend and I had NO IDEA it was such a haunted city!!!!!
Wish you would’ve stayed off
Went there as a teen and it’s 100% real… everyone from Aurora, Colorado knows about 3rd bridge, scary!!!
Chris’s laugh is like: 😯😗💨😯😗💨
Went there as a teen and it’s 100% real… everyone from Colorado knows about 3rd bridge, scary!!!
Sweet, Shane’s always wanted to do a show like this. Now he’s hit the restart button and took a break, he can do this now. Very cool!
When will you post the other video?
33:13 that laugh tho 🤣🤣
What's the other dogs name?
I'm only a couple minutes in and I have to say... Morgan looks SO good!!
33:13
so hear me out LOL.  shane dawson does a colab with  Brittany_Broski and her mom. ghost hunting. =D both are hilarious and fun to watch!!!!
Love ya Shane but I hope this FINALE is epic AF.  2 videos of hyping us up with your family.  Pls man.
I’m really just trying to give constructive criticism but this video was everywhere from the house is haunted, the park, the bridge then just sitting around talking about the tik tok bathroom thing/ clips of random people saying the same thing over and over  I was skipping so much idk If it was just me ? My ADHD brain couldn’t handle it
We have a haunted house here in Ohio called Cheesemans named after the “Park”
I'm so glad you're back
Welcome back sir! You were dearly missed. Xo 🥰🥰 now drop part 3 were all waiting like 👀👀👀
Morgan is a star!
i’m sorry but morgan is gorgeous
I think Shane needs to bring back up just incase because this is mad
Ryland's dad is my new favorite person
I live in Aurora. Went to third bridge years ago. Lots of activity there. Welcome to Colorado! Want to go to a very cool place? Go to Victor and stay at the Victor Hotel.
love you shane im so happy you came back. you make me so happy i really needed it lately :).
Third Bridge!!!!! i love it there. I have seen the red car
I missed your sarcastic ass
I love you thanks for the upload 🥺
Good to have you back
love this but I have to come on here and say that the camera is driving me nuts. it's shaky, all over the place, dizzying, lots of times not focused you guys need to get a stabilizer or steadycam something please
Tell it to leave in the name of Jesus guys, ghosts r demons mocking humans
Talk about Dave chappelle
10:00 the boston terrier is SO. CUTE!!!!
Wait, why does rylands mom sound like ellen
at the beginning it really looked like it could be a movie lol
Omg your back I am sooooo happy ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I’m glad your back lad
Good take on the native american history. Hope we see more of this where the content is actually helping out minorities by creating these conversations. It seems only right after the whole messy content Shane used to do. Excited to see the new content.
Morgan is so pretty
CHEESEMAN PARK IS HAUNTED!!! I rode a scooter through the park at night to my best friends house and shewww never again will I go out there at night. Also a lot of boys go cruising out there too but yeahhhh
i can't tell where one chin ends and the other begins.
… all of you need to touch some grass the people who cant get rid of their horrible fav hows comeback is time filling and profiting off and making a mocery of tragedies and native deaths considering part of the reason he “left” pls stay gone it’s disgusting this is right on the back of indegenous people week if anyone cared in the prouduction of this he would serve research and respect not shocked faces and rumored clips and a cute little story from sis in law. chok€
I love how Shane is still trending…. Welcome back Shane king of YouTube
Rylands grandmother may be suffering from hearing loss. Helping her get the treatment or device she needs would go a long way to increasing her quality of life. She always understands what's happening once she hears what's being said!
Utah is the same way you think everyone is here nice but so many serial killers have lived there and a lot of them were Mormon
11:02 Rylands reaction is literally saying “people never learn…”
Conspiracy theories!!!!! Bring them back!! N
There’s no better time for this. Kids asleep & I’m on the couch with a snack. I’ve been waiting for this moment the past 2 days to watch!
Okay but Rylans Dad is so wholesome, cool and sweet, he needs his own YouTube channel haha!
I am so glad your back ❤️❤️
2 years for this jeez
leave.
Im skuuuurreeedddd and i like it!  Yay Shane!
ok i seriously missed these videos
I thought we were done giving pedos a platform?
I’m glad Shane is back. I miss you you crazy bishh
Imagine being a grown man and still believing in ghosts.
i love that youre back with this but you used so many videos from a haunting in Colorado. i feel like you shouldve been speaking on the research you found like how you do in your other conspiracy videos or maybe morgan couldve had a small segment with a more professional looking area to talk about the situation. i think its a good start back but please go back to how you used to do it cause we could just watch a haunting in colorados videos and just skip to the end of yours for all the context but your fans wanna watch you for you i loved seeing you sit infront of the camera and talking about stuff.
4:40 It reached my school. Its called the lick trend... it'ss so stupid...😒😒
dusgusting, you shouldnt have any type of platform
I really wish your camera guy could control himself. Not everything that’s said is funny or a que for him to laugh. He’s so distracting
Why is somebody in the trunk?  I laughed so hard . I have missed these videos  so much!!oh!! Roland's grandmother is so sweet..
The scariest thing this halloween is that this dude is back
😂😂
OMG Morgan at 17:24 is absolutely stunninggggg
i can't believe this is real and i'm not in a weird coma
yooo gunther from shake it up?!
bruce really loves to sprinkle in that “national” about the tiktok licks 😂😂
Hurry up with the next video🙄
You're everything 💖💖✨
Now this is the content that Shane needs to be doing. I've always loved his paranormal series and stand alone videos. I'm so glad you are back Shane.
I’m so happy to see your again! Welcome back!
Looking at how far apart the like/dislike bar is this video is giving me hope that people are willing to forgive Shane and move on
Too much editing in of other people's videos and their coverage on the area/story... It's way better in pervious series when Shane and everyone just do it themselves and add in maybe 1 or 2 clips of outside material.
genuinely, morgan is so beautiful.
Shane came back just to be insensitive and make 'creepy' stories out of tragic historical events for Native American people
Loved the video Shane!! You are doing amazing
We need to go in some serious ghost hunts or new conspiracy theories plzzzzz Shane!!!! Whose with me for Conspiracy theories??? 😳👻🛸👽🧜‍♀️🐷💄🎥
Anyone else sometimes wait to watch videos like this so theres not too much time in-between uploads? Thats me 😅 Shane i can speak for us all and say you can go ahead and make hour long videos...but i get it, one step at a time 💝
SHANE POST THE NEW VID NOWWWW
:,) I missed this
Please do a Kendall Rae collab!!
Morgan is so adorable when she is talking about the history of third bridge!! :)
おかえりー！
It’s dead like the  Massacre victims. Lmaooo
I’ve missed you so much I’m so glad your bad a hope you post a lot you make me laugh liu
This is kinda boring. I prefer to see his everyday life with Ryland, the animals and the new house
Are they filtering hate comments?
Why does Shane overreact when hearing creepy stuff? Like yes it’s scary but you’re not gonna get killed for hearing it😂
I’m so glad he didn’t let a bunch of dumbass kids who try to cancel everyone run him off the internet man. You’re only cancelled if you cancel yourself. I’m glad he’s now not gonna give a fuck and do his own thing. No more addressing old shit every 2 years. Welcome back Shane, I missed you
It makes me sad that the Third bridge is now known as such a "scary and haunted" place when it really was just a home for those who were victims of an awful mass murder hours away. I hope this video reaches out to those in Colorado and it can become a beautiful memorial for the innocent, instead of being viewed as a horrific place.
50% other people content 20% unnecessary scary sounds  30% shane being awkward, dramatic and funny in the wrong moments
I love how over dramatic this whole video is lol It makes me jiggle instead of feeling scared
It’s the grandmother for me.
https://youtu.be/pmvtliYEhdY Shane kissed a 12 year old !
https://youtu.be/pmvtliYEhdY
Morgan is so pretty!!! 👀👀👀❤❤❤❤❤
K so I love Ryland's dad lol
So glad you’re back, Shane!
Why’s this #18 on tending and not #1. Love Grandma btw.
disgusting massacre.
Morgan rubbing her hands 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼lol
Shane is crying at 28:03 when he realizes this is more than just paranormal hoopla. I am right with him.  I would be torn if I were him as well.  This was a great idea until we heard all of the stories and then it was frightening.     Yes, I said hoopla.  Let the fun pooking begin.  LOL I doubt very much if Shane would ever see this comment, but I think he was crack up at "hoopla"   haha
I saw part 2 posted - immediately turned out the lights, grabbed a snack, and got comfy
Naked Goat Farms has some great ointment for super dry skin and for demons to calm the eff down. --side note
“I’m just a big ole white man that just wants to show the creepy spookies.” 😭
This is what I wanted four years ago.
I forgot how much joy watching these made me
I need you guys to drop the next video! I miss you all so much and want to keep binge watching 😭💚
So that’s all that happened ? Shane is just back now ?
The profile pic is bringing me back flash backs
look- i don’t like or support shane for what he did but i missed watching his videos. he was my comfort youtuber and he made me laugh when i needed him
In san Diego they have the same thing - a park where they removed most of the headstones but not the bodies if they couldn't afford to be moved
Insteaď of making a big fiasco of lost or unrested souls,  go find some professional mediums to HELP THEM move on or CROSS OVER. ( please )
honestly kind of cool as a native American myself that Shane is showing our history and the things we still go through now is horrible. im also a quarter asian too so its been hard during covid too.
Shane. You left and my life went to sh!+ don't ever leave me again. I missed you. 🫂
IM SO FUCKING HAPPY TO SEE SHANES NAME POP UP BC HES POSTING AGAIN
morgan looks so pretty
Im Here for the camera mans laugh 😂 💗
Yeah I think Colorado is the most haunted place in America
OMG Grandma is just the cutest! I'm so glad you're back Shane! I'm proud of you!
Morgan looked so gorgeous in this video like she literally looks like Megan Fox
no one is going to talk about what ryland said about the girls???…
MORGAN HAD A GLOW UP
I’ve missed you so much I’m so glad that you’re back love you thank you for making contact
18:20 i like how the guy dont give af abt the ghost 😭🤚🏻
Thank you for including the native history of the area. Current generations need to learn these things so they understand the Native American struggles, even now. All of that gets lost in the "history" classes.
ive literally been to this park and had no idea-
I haven’t seen the whole video yet, but they should totally go checkout Riverdale Road too. In Thornton.
Thank you for mentioning our indigenous history
Rip to all the innocent souls who died !
So glad your back Shane, missed all this and glad everyone is doing so well ❤️
I love that Shane's back I missed him and the fam their so funny I love it
Hello, Loved the video, Can you make the PINK PIG BACKPACK available in CHILE? I tried buying it on the website and my country wasn't on the options
Downtown Ottawa Canada is built right on top of a huge burial ground. Many of the buildings there are deemed to be haunted. There are also parts of Montreal like that as well.
Im so happy that he is back im sure the rest of you feel the same.
Jesus i really need this right now
Missed you Shane thank you for coming back!
I'm so happy to have your videos again ❤
Why is this one so short? :(
Someone definitely manifested his comeback.
Like just get to the point already..??
mr.dawson, how utterly disgusting to see you again
The hero I needed and wanted.
why are you still here…
I’m from Colorado, shane should go to Riverdale road!
FINALLY MY BOY😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH
absolutely disrespectful for you to show human remains because 1- you did not warn anyone and 2- you're not educating anyone. these are real people and everyone single one of you involved in making this video (talking to you shane!) are disrespectful idiots, get off the internet.
I find it so funny when people who have lived in towns/cities their whole lives go out even a little ways into the country and freak out.😂😂 “Do people live out here? No it’s WAY out..” I’m pretty sure since people own the land out there for their cattle they don’t live THAT far away. A large portion of the country’s population live in very rural areas. But people who have lived in towns/cities their whole lives seem to forget that or have a difficult time understanding it. Also love how such people always mention how DARK it is…well yea…when you don’t have streetlights every so many feet it’s going to be dark at night unless there’s a full moon!😂😂 —I’ve lived my entire life 45min from the nearest real town. Our property is literally surrounded by 100s of thousand of acres of National Forest. And I live in what people call the Deep South just 2hrs from New Orleans. People in the ghost hunting community say the South is heavily haunted which I would agree with. Our 98 acre property was the main part of a cotton plantation in the past and the owners of that plantation are actually buried in a tiny cemetery on our property less than a 100yrds from the house. Plus an actually proven Native American burial mound was discovered & investigated(aka dug thru & artifacts removed)by the local college’s & the state’s archeology depts at the back edge of our property.  — That being said…look at the story about the park in the middle of downtown Denver! There are spooky, creepy & haunted places everywhere humans have lived for any length of time. I think it just seems safer in towns/cities bc there are always other people & police nearby. But out in the country there often isn’t anyone close enough to hear if you scream for help and often you lose cell service as well…so you can’t even call for help. It’s only been in the last year that we’ve started getting some cell service out where I live. Which is why everyone in the area still has landlines as their main phones for when they’re home.  — I do hope they are careful bc one of the real dangers of such places which are far enough out to be considered “remote” but still relatively close to town is that many such spots end up being used for selling drugs & other illegal activities.😕
Oh Shane. How I love thee. Been here since 2005 and we are around the same age just a few months apart but born on my hubby’s birthday
I love rylands dad
How did YouTube not notify me of this how am I 2 days late 😭😭
yay shanes back!
why tf do all the comments sound so sarcastic
This "spooky" stuff is truly over reaching.  It must be so scary in the Colorado suburbs. Like really??
What an absolute train wreck this has been. Nothing but dissapointment.
I love the video!  The music is a littler much but overall; welcome back!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
We can't hear the drums because you talked over it the whole time -_-
I love Ryland’s grandma tho
Okay but Morgan is so pretty damn...
i love kendall rae so much i would die if you got her on
Tiny shane hands
Omg I can't wait till the next one. They just talked about it for 30 minutes and we didn't get to see them go do anything.
The “no service” thing with Ryland was a little…concerning.
I grew up in Aurora Colorado and its so crazy to hear all the stories about third bridge. I graduated high school in 2019 and its still so talked about and visited.
the king is back
y r u still relevant
the dad is so invested in the school trashing 😂
amazing production value!!!
Had to pause the video just to say how Gorgeous Morgan is. SHEESH!! That's all.
SHANE OMG YOURE BACK WE MISSED YOU
hm
25:30
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨Shane please help tell my haunting story! The house is still haunted by the ghost who haunted me and we could film there!!! PLEASE!!!🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
I feel like I'm watching an "Editing is everything" Edit of shanes normal videos
This whole video could have been an email…
bro... how did you spend five whole boring minutes on the history of a place you don't even go to in the video? talk about a waste of time. and using other people's videos to explain everything lol
Meow meow
i honestly don’t care if y’all get mad at me for this ik what he’s done and stuff but shane was my comfort you tubers when i was in a bad mental state and i’m getting there now so to watch his videos and be able to laugh is so refreshing
so everyone just forgot what he did or???
everyone making the park sound so bad because it used to be cemetery meanwhile im here like ...okay and? because my city has its own park that used to be a cemetery and we even call it dead mans park and ive lived here my whole life sooooo hahaha
Shane is so handsome 🥰 wish he was into women also lol
i love rylandsdad hes giving Taurus heavilyyyyy lmao
I'm genuinely so happy he's back he brings so much comfort to me, what he did was wrong but you can tell he's changing as a person
Shane should have to the story, not Morgan. 🙄
Shane did you lose weight?
I hope they go to all those haunted places they talked about in different series. 🥰
So three parts to go to one place? That’s a little insane
Im a day late😤😤🖤
YOU CAME BACK YESSSS
Third time watching!  Can’t stop Won’t stop  O B S E S S E D👻
Me being native and watching this lol 😂 damn good luck
welcome back,missed you <3
delete it fat
Morgan is so beautiful i just can’t. She looks like a blond Megan Fox
The Sand Creek Massacre actually happened very close to my town, and my family and I drive by the memorial almost everyday
The school bathroom vandalism happened at my school too. They needed to lock all but 1 bathroom in the building where we had the best camera in the halls. There was a sign in sign out sheet and a teacher was always there to monitor it.
The PR team for that cities parks and recs watching this like: 👁️👄👁️
When Morgan said “Aspiration” instead of “Apparition” it sent me to my grave 🤣😭❤️
I love this, just in the first few minutes it feels so comforting and relaxing and as the vide goes on it gets scarier. I love it!
The number of times Morgans says "soooooooo"
https://youtube.com/shorts/IUHggkYipB8?feature=share
Is nobody going to talk about what Ryland said at 20:45 ? That's so fucked up. Boys should not grow up thinking behavior like this is okay.
Shane, I kept checking your YouTube in the whole time you were gone, it's such a breath of fresh air that you're back, back with a BANG! please don't go away this time, bring on more of your awesome spooky content, loved loved loved your conspiracy and horror videos! Keep it coming dude! Love from Pakistan. ❤️
Shane we miss you a lot! Thanks for coming back! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍
How funny, I live in Arapaho county too in Denver! Hope to meet y’all someday!
sobbing and throwing up missed u
I would've had a lot more respect for you if you stayed gone and actually worked on yourself
People are seriously letting this freak back on the internet again?
Shane... About the Native graves/land ,As a Native I feel i need to tell you guys, Please be careful, respectful & mindful of the ground in which y'all reside. Show her respect,cause her no harm and speak for them if its laid upon you. Show them the respect they were not offered in life. If you do y'all will be just fine. Even more so, may even become protected. It's within the soul, not the skin color in which they retaliate. Yes, I'm fully aware of how crazy this sounds. No, idk if it's truly real. I do know I've been to many Nation wide and those areas have a way about them.

we really needed this shit. missed ya shane and gang:)
MUCH prefer the comment section I’ve seen on this video! No one can deny that Shane makes/produces quality content, regardless of his past.   Cancel culture is cringy 🥴
I love this so hard!!!!!
I hate this guy
Dude I never realized how pretty Morgan is
Hes back lesgo
And here I thought everyone actually hated Shane. Or was that just the "cool" thing to do for some of you??
Glad he is back. But this editing😓
Pdf files like shane should get lined up against the wall.
Shane you're taunting spirits that could seriously hurt you
This is absolutely terrifying in real life. I’m from Colorado and the park is all sorts of wrong. I can confirm that all background info is real and Shane put a lot of work into that research
WE'VE MISSED YOU SOOO MUCH!!!
Wow that's actually sad, like hearing about these deaths makes me sad and scared
I always loved you Shane, even if I disagreed with your controversial past! Glad you're back on track! Don't let the haters get you down!
mistake at 20:17?
Shane thank you for coming back!! We really did miss you, At least those of us who are here to actually be your fans and support you, Those who are here because they have no life and enjoy making others feel bad for their own sick joy should be ignored, you don’t need that negativity. Wishing you the best and hope to see more videos!! You’ve been a huge inspiration for me and my sister for years now, Keep being you because you’re amazing!!
So glad to see Shane back. Welcome to CO! 😁
I’ve seen a few comments as to people saying that this is inappropriate and disrespectful that you released this, but I have to disagree. Until now, I have never even heard of this massacre and was completely unaware of what happened to those innocent people. I think it is incredibly important to remember history as a way to not repeat it, and I like that Shane is using his platform to educate on an extremely prevalent historical event such as this. He did not make light of anything that Morgan talked about and he was empathetic of the whole situation.
Wow Shane nice video! Really loved the part where you exploited indigenous people’s massacre 😀😀😀 Seriously tho, wtf are you doing going to a place where so many Native Americans were massacred and treating it like a spooky hunt really man?
F U to all the ppl that disliked the video
i want part 3 out rn its so good so far
I love these haunted videos that Shane Dawson does because I like supernatural things and I also watch Kendall I love her videos
man i thought you were fucking cancelled
You should definitely look into Overtoun bridge here in Scotland. It’s known for dogs to commit suicide there. A man also threw his baby off of the bridge. It’s really weird
YESSS SHANE YOUR BACKKKK FINALLY
HESSS BACKKKKKKKK
Shane!!!!! God how I've missed you!!! You're my spirit animal 1000% 🧡
Bru did you really think we'd forgive & forget?
Lol the spookiest part was that guy using a metal fork on a pan ☠💀 30:28
“hopefully we don’t die”  gramma : “yep”  😂😂😂😂
ITS THE WHOLE FAMILY!
OMG, pardon me for getting so excited when I saw Omar pop up!! He’s one of my fav you tubers and is somehow forgotten by other explorers!!
1:25 Shane thinking about young kids again 🤔
HES FUCKING BACK
It would be kinda neat if you guys went to these locations with a medium! That way you could hopefully gather the ghosts experience, or help them find peace and go to the other side.
Idk if the cameraman is really laughing or if he’s faking it 🥲
love youuuuuuuu
This is genuinely some of the worst editing I’ve ever seen…..there is literally no focus at all in both this and the first part…
We love you shane!!!
im going to colorado tonight. im gonna try to go to those places
wait i live in colorado and my school is literally called sand creek 💀 i had no idea there was a whole back story i just knew i lived near a creek called sand creek 😭
An aspiration of a little girl!! 🤣😆😭
no one who’s “cancelled” is really ever cancelled.
Morgan is too pretty !!!!
i love rylands dad!!!! he needs to be in more videos!
This video made me feel like I was hanging out my moms side of the family in the best way possible
This is a very diabolical video
Hiding comments now huh? SHANE KISSED A 13 YEAR OLD ON CAMERA AS AN ADULT
Oh my god Morgan is so prettyyy
Spooky/conspiracy Shane is my favorite Shane.  I’d love to see more of this in his vids☺️ It’s his specialty!
Shane so happy you are making videos. 💓 Please make more. If I can just say, camera is so shaky got nauseated 3 times. Also I'm like the only one, but not a fan of Megan 🙄
I needed this
Ok the craziest thing is that I have not been following up on Shane in a long time and randomly I really want to watch one of his conspiracy videos and then I find this
So you know that clip when they were talking about like the Parkplace and how it had to be like closed or whatever because to me weird things were happening The place that they showed at night no joke I’ve seen that in one of my dreams before
Dis is a classic Shane edit
Is been said that when you have buried a body and then move it to another place and is not complete that soul doesn’t Rest In Peace .. and is the same happens when a body is cremated and you take the aches and divided them to give them let’s say to family members that should doesn’t Rest In Peace earthier …. The body have to remain with all his parts together.
I just wanna be best friends with Morgan
Ok so I really don’t care but can you like find Jenna Marbles and bring her back instead thanks
It doesn't matter what Shane makes its always going to be trending. Crazy
It was good until it got political. I came here to get away from everything else that has unfortunately become political. It's literally the only thing on TV, being talked about, being bitchched about, it's everywhere. I was so excited and so ready for Shane to come back but this is like he's jumping in this because that's what's popular at the moment. It's very disheartening.
Someone has a link to the 2018 Shane video?
Im very happy Shane is back ! and bringing the spooky vibes~~~ I honestly love him so much
I really really needed some Shane, Ryland and Morgan fam today. YouTube just isn't the same without you all. 🥲 I'm so fkn happy you guys are back. we love & support you, Shane! 💖🙏✨
I don't care bro, I love you Shane Dawson, cancel me you cancel culture rats
Uhm what are you doing here again?
Can you please react to ,,,THE LADY OF HEAVEN Movie Trailler,,,🙏🙏🏻🙏🏻😍
I have literally never seen so many bots in the comments (aside from a bitcoin video)
Literally what why have i never heard of this before
YouTube was kinda stale until Shane came back
No offense to Chris, but for gods sake just buy a camera stablizer!
We love Ryland's family especially his dad😆😆😆
we are all happy you are doing this!
Literally is very evident in the comments people are playing his comments on natives for laughs also alot of pick mes in this comments. I hope he fucking leaves and never comes back this is beyond excusable
Morgan is sooooo daaaaamn fineeee thick curvy beautiful blonde I wonder if she knows how good she is
Yay! Couldn't wait for part 2 & now I can't wait for part 3 😍
Can you please quit again
I live a few miles from where the actual sand creek massacre took place and the actual sight is super, super haunted, too. A lot of people say if you go up there at night you can still figures and hear noises there, I've had a couple really weird experiences there.
"There's all these abandoned houses that were the houses of people who once resided there."  They sure are 😂😂
that ch1ld you messaged on a1m saying you'd b10w him deserves an apology shane......
trayv0n mart1n's family is still waiting on an apology from when you made fun of their son getting mur.dered shane......
Shane!!! These videos are EVERYTHING🔥 I cannot wait till the next video 😬
As a Native American when I heard that natives were slaughtered there I was like “girllllll natives don’t play”
God I’m so f*cking happy Shane is back, thank you for creating for us again :) and I’m so happy you’re doing well
Ryland is meeeee 💀  “Everything follows you, ghost, demons, me “ 😂😂
I like this but it’s just soooooooooooooooooo repetitive it’s like hearing the same stuff over and over again in one video it’s weird
I’m not canceling him idc 😭
morgan is so pretty
almost every comment is boosted by several b0t responses, lmao thats why engagement is so high. same old pdf- file up to his old bulls1t
Steve from blues clues came back. Shane came back. My year is pretty emotionally okay right now
whos mour new camera man
Thanks for disabling negative comments. They can all go vent on twitter.
Get Grandma a new hearing aid already geez! Poor woman.
Makes me so happy to see Shane back and happy and just being his funny self your a strong willed person and your coming back on top I can’t wait too see more and love the family like vlogs too ❤️ much love from Newfoundland Canada
Yes! So glad you're back
this is really cringy but fun
You came back just in time for spooky season, I am so happy you're doing better. Watching this during the daytime cause I want to sleep at night. :D
Shane I am so happy you are back! YES keep running 💩 YouTube is not the same without you ❤️
I love how shane lives in this echo chamber of opinions. Like he asked if it was disrespecful to profit off of an indigenous massacre like its some silly little urban story noone in the room told him that it was. They just laughed it off like it was nothing and not a genocide that is still being denied to this day. The least he could do for using native peoples tragedies as a gag is donate the millions he did and will do off this video to a covid fund or sum. This man does not care and neither his white fans who still agree with him 🖕
I can't wait for more of your content .  I do believe in spirits and specially ones that are still wandering as I have several in my home but they seem happy with me and my son as we have ghost equipment and they like when we talk with them .
love the series but the cameraman gots to go
My moms family lives in aurora I wonder were this is
ok but the kids destroying the bathrooms is so fucking funny
Welcome  back 🤍🤍
On the queen Mary video I seen a reflection of a little girl in the window that you guys dident see but she was standing on the bed with a dress on and it was clearly a little girl not one of yous this was in the room where you slept in I think
These videos are actually some of the dumbest content on YouTube.
That it was unus annus again with the intro
Rylan's dad looks like clairvoyant from Człuchów; Krzysztof Jackowski.
“Uhh… dead…….. like the massacre victims” 🤣🤣🤣 who is that guy I need to sub to him ASAP
Gah damn nothing happed in this video. It was a preface
the cowboy ghost is actually micah bell
I love and missed Shane so so much.
Jenna please be next
ryland's parents: you ready to make your internet comeback shane? also ryland's parents: aight king we need you to take down tiktok rq
FINALLY your back!!!! love your videos!! your an amzing soul.:)
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🎈
Y'all think 5,000 bodies are scary.... Come to Charleston. There's 100s of thousands of bodies under streets, buildings and just everywhere.
why is the Dawson Adams squad so iconic and relatable- LMAO
Morgan has always been pretty but omg she had like a mega glow up she’s SHININGGGG☝️
Yes love your videos 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
)
Happy, you're back!!!
Wow… the “motivation” behind the sand creek massacre is disgusting.. and that the native people were even flying the American flag and a truce flag but they still showed no mercy. Horrible and tragic
Okay, I have to know what Rylands mom does for a living with that HUGE monitor.
I lived in Colorado Springs, and have visited the Sand Creek Massacre site. Yeah, Colorado is weirder than most places, perhaps because people there are getting less oxygen to their brain from the altitude? 😂
but i love you shaneeee
i’m watching this video and i get a message that my godfather passed away. this youtube channel is HAUNTED
The amount of people in the comments just pretending as if what he did was small and can be quickly moved on from is disturbing
We are so happy you're back and that you've been healing, can't wait to see what's to come 💖
Absolutely nothing has changed
Today is my wedding day and this made it so much less stressful 🥰
Ugh I miss you Shane and all you guys I love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how unintentionally sarcastic Morgan is🤣
I feel bad for these two. This is so embarrassing
please never stop posting
Chris' little test run song is so WHOLESOME! :')
I dont like him as a person but ill still watch him cause his videos are extremely interesting
😵
it’s sad how shane seemed so close to getting it but continued and released these videos, u were right when u asked if these this would be disrespectful.

Yes he’s back
shane i’ve missed tf outta you and these horror videos 😭
Omg that clip of the bathroom and the wall hanging out is at my school💀😂
Morgan is so pretty I couldn’t stop looking at her the whole time 🥺🥺
Love this video well done and welcome back ! Happy your back 🙌🏽💕
This seemed really forced, the terror was to exaggerated, most of the video was just other videos. these aren’t giving the same vibe :/ ghost videos were only good because of the spooky boys gotta be honest.
Ms. Kendall Rae made n appearance 😂❤️ I love kendall!
YouTube really needs more cool reality tv style ghost shows
Please do a new conspiracy theory series on all the UFO govt docs that came out during the pandemic. It would be soooo cool!
Ryland's dad is everything
What’s the name of where they go?!
Clicked paused and disliked. This man is perverse
I completely needed you to come back and here we are 🥰
I hate how ryland acts and talks😂 he makes me cringe
Did y’all just forget what he did or something 😐🤨
omg, I crush so hard on Morgan! Good to see you all back and well.
no bc why are all these comments positive? y'all really never cared about the fucked up things he did, did you?
I’m so glad you are back Shane!!!
I've watched the two come-back videos about 8 times each. I'm so happy. Proud of your growth!
Kids legit started a fire in my school building. We had to evacuate and dismiss the rest of the day. No one could get back in for their items until the next day, us teachers included. Sucked.
Ok next part please 🙏
" I hope I don't die" "...yeah"
Your editing skills makes ur videos 100% better
Good to see y'all again but ummm..where TF you been buddy?
I think the scariest thing in Colorado is you, Shane.
i need part 3 nowwww
Loved both videos so far. I'm happy to see you back, even if it is only possibly going to be a short time. Ease yourself into being back slowly, that way you will know how you feel at that specific time and know if you want to do more. Looking forward to the last part, stay well.
The Kendal shoutout hahaha
I'm so happy to see these series again. Welcome back Shane and crew ❤️🤙
ChoMo
Hes a teacher and affords a house like that in CO??? 🤔
I am so enjoying that you are back, it is so fun and you new place looks amazing!  can't wait to see what you'll create here.  You both look blissful!
I love how honest Ryland's dad is
Did you all just forget what this pos did???? Wtf
I swear cancel culture is just fake. Accept it twitter snowflakes
I love Ryland Mom and Dad  from one Vickie to another Vickie your awesome.
Omg we love you Shane! So glad to se you post!
the lady really said "ghosts need energy to survive" like they aren't already dead...
Welcome back, Shane
So happy you are back shane!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
does morgan not know how hot she looks wow, and shane u look so good as well
I'm so glad I can just sit and enjoy some spoopy Shane again.
WELCOME BACK MISS YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK. LOVE YOU AND RYLAND!!!! YOU ARE A INSPIRATION TO ME. sorry for screaming capitals Shane but I am so happy to see you back and hope you do more of these video I have always love them . STAY POSITIVE.
Rylan looks just like his grandmother!
Morgan is so pretty wtf
Rylands dad is hilarious
“I feel like Kendall Rae”😭
YESSSSS IM SO GLAD YOURE BACK
10% of the comments are taking about rylands family  90% of the comments are about how good Morgan looks
DID ANYONE ELSE THINK SHANES APOLOGY WAS LIKE THE MOST GENUINE THING EVER AND GOT CONFUSED WHEN EVERYONE WAS MAD AT HIM LIKE I STILL DUNNO  I THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD APOLOGY
Man why they always gotta say it's a black guy😂💀
Y’all should come to Oklahoma! We have a Spook light right by Quapaw reservation! So much history here.
Where is Shane’s mom 🥲 need her back in the vids
Idc about your past! I’ll always love you!! Your amazing and I find you so funny hehe you are literally my favourite <3 welcome back
You need to take a weekend drive to New Mexico. The entire city of Santa Fe is haunted one way or the other. You can actually afford to stay in one of the many old haunted mansions/hotels So you can get up close and personal with them. There are Hotels and B&Bs in old haunted Hospitals, mansions, and churches. Take your pick. Ghost hunting in style. I would looooove to see that.
see bc now you just playing .. last vid said this was going to be the video ya actually go to the place and now it’s in the 3rd video .. boi
“She wouldn’t hear them coming” omg 😂😂😂😂
i missseeeddd you so much, you guys literally  make me so happy
broooo morgan looks so gooooood. cute queen!!!!
We missed you❤
I literally jumped up and down clapping and squealing when I seen this 2nd post! Haha. Love that you’re back! 🥰🥰🥰
honestly I can listen to Morgan telling stories all day.  this series is giving me the creeps.
I love the background music/into so atmospheric x
А
Morgan still fine
Ryland’s dad is literally every dad I know  “I was in science class and my penis caught on fire” 😂😂😂😂
Youtubers; "Dry scooping trend on tik tok, new trend of destroying school bathrooms..." My tik tok FYP; "BERRIES AND CREAM..."
Morgan looks so beautiful with her hair long I love it!!
Shane, thank you. I needed your videos SO BADLY
22:20  Just like how George bush did in 9/11
Let's go Brandon.  Better dead than red.
woooooooo ur back
Shane: That's so sweet, I hope I don't die.... Grandma: yeah! .......literally dead x_x   LOOOOOOOOOL
Say what y’all want I’m glad Shane’s back
I hope Shane’s family moved to Colorado too so that Shane has both his support system and Ryland’s too! I’m so happy he is back!!!
damn... Morgan :O
Out of LA looks good on yall
morgan looks so pretty 🤩
Shane’s a great youtuber and entertainer, I enjoy watching his videos and glad he’s back. If you think that because of the past he should stop his career - just unfollow and stop watching 🤷‍♀️
27:20 LMAOOOO
side note: morgan looks stunning in this video
I get why kids would steal toilet paper/ soap but not all the other stuff
Lmfao, the school punished everyone in the school because someone did the bathroom TikTok trend
https://youtu.be/zUmNYtjIPik
Shane Dawson sir...can we make the videos longer? I could watch a 24 hour video of you guys just goofing around...I honestly need it at this point 😭🤣❤
Oh Shane, how I've missed you!
Glad you're back!!
wait ppl are actually happy this horrible man is uploading?
Can i just say why is morgan so pretty :(
Shane's back to breaking the internet 🤣
Y'all are really acting like nothing happened???
please stay this time oml <33
What if there was a TikTok trend of teens cleaning up the bathroom to help overworked janitors or something. That might sound lame but school staff are underpaid so imagine if kids helped them out instead of being pieces of shit lol
I never stopped loving Shane. His videos helped me and Shane basically raised me for a whole summer when I was younger.
thank god your back
We are literally all for cancel culture unless it’s someone we like huh?
we don’t gaf
Omg I literally missed you so much
Welcome to Colorado land of the haunted lol I look forward to exploring the places you go to, to see for myself
Grandma doesn’t have her hearing aids in.
Rylands Dad is hilarious haha
The new camera man laughs too much a little. He is lovely and we love him already but sometimes he just laughs for no reason. 😅maybe he should chill a little. I know he is probably just nervous
Loving these new videos
Cemetery > Flat grass field
Morgan - I was more afraid in California but actually here your more likely to get murdered  Shane ….. cool… ok great  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rest In Peace to all those natives who passed
Miss you Shane and friends!
We knew you weren’t really sorry for all the nasty things you’ve done. You just can’t get enough attention.. narcissist.
You’re still the worst, Shane.
again with the kids. jesus. leave the kids alone.
rest in peace to the sand creek massacre victims
Oh my gosh I love this I can’t wait for the next episode!
yall yes back 💀
This was great 🤣Not all spirits or ghosts need living people's energy to "survive". I don't know why so many psychics say this but this is not true. Lower vibrational spirits like earth-bound spirits do and most of those are so negative they suck the energy just because they simply want to for more power and control. Thank you for featuring me again! If you ever want a psychic on one of your adventures, hit me up! 💜
Who knows that girl with the black lipstick YouTube channel?
I missed your videos so much 🥺❤️
21:28
Literally missed you Shane so so much!!
I missed you
Yassssssss
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
SHANE POST MORE PLEASE IM IN THE HOSPITAL AND IM BORED AND I WANT PART 3!
love u shane!! 💜💜💜
I really love how he talked about the native americans, not enough awareness is spread about how peaceful and how wronged they were. We know it was wrong but we never get to understand how wrong this literally made me tear up how they even hung the white flag but still suffered😢
WHO YOU GONE CALL?? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Welcome to NASA 😂😂😂Great video! And a great start to a rainy Saturday morning ! Cheers ✌ ❤ 🔪🎃
Gramma is my favourite <3
So yall just gonna forget everything that he has done?
So glad Shane is back 💕
Plz save the Bangladeshi Hindus they Deserve to live 🇧🇩 #Stop_Communal_Attack   #Save_Bangladeshi_Hindus #BangladeshiHinduWantSafety #SaveBangladeshiHindus #WeDemandSafety #WeDemandJustice #SaveHindus
Love you Shane! I’m so proud of you! 💜💜
I’m not even gonna cap right now when they described the tall man in a trench coat with the hat my ENTIRE BODY got chills. I’ve seen that shadow man since I was a kid. I’m kinda relieved that others have seen him as well.
SO glad your views are terrible
Morgan so pretty
Stay off the internet. We don't want you.
Nope I used to love Shane but I can't get over the past
SHANE! YOURE BACK!!!! OMG WE MISSED YOU! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
https://youtu.be/CbEQa9xf1vk  How tf do you people forget about this shit? Shane demonstrates repeated, disgusting behavior, and only “changes” when caught. Fr internet get your shit together.
0:21 - when Shane finds some _kids_ on discount
Ryland's dad being a vibe
Welcome back shane iv missed ur videos here in the UK 🇬🇧
White men literally get everything handed to them in this world because this video is absolute shit, but there's people in the comments claiming it's like a Netflix documentary
perfect timing…. saw this as soon as i got off night shift!! time to watch my all time favorite before going to sleep 😊
ahh 1864, the year that native americans were killed for no reason and the year the salvatore brothers became vampires🤗
Bro this was 35 minutes of them saying the same shit in their living room/kitchen
Welcome back.
I'm so glad you're back Shane! I'll follow you anywhere too! 👻👻🤣🤣
When i tell u i yelled so loud when it said he posted
I think the botanical garden is kind of beautiful. It represents a cycle and the circle of life. The dead’s soil is being used to bloom beautiful pedals and leaves. I “dig” it.
#7 ON TRENDING
Welcome back Shane 🥰
HEY SHANES BACK! LOVED THIS VID MISSED YOU💗
Yay Shane!!! My kind of videos!
Get that night vision camera please
Why am I simping for Morgan is she single?
What’s so crazy is this happened with a park in my home town. It was a giant cemetery and is now a park and a lot of bodies remain there.
My anxiety has been so awful lately and I have missed Shane’s Videos so much
What's your new camera man's name? Chris? He's so shaky with the camera. Chris, would you please try to be a little more still when you're focusing on a subject? When you're reacting, the view trembles a lot with your laughter.
Bruh get out of here we do not like you 😍 respectfully
Im trying to watch this, but that camera guys laugh, i cant listen to
Finally....
UM MORGAN IS GORGEOUS WHAT
Morgan looks so good and healthy.
When the world needed him the most he vanished... Two years later my sister and I discovered the youtuber named shane although his editing skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Shane Dawson can save the world.
morgan is 🔥 my lord
Thanks for coming back Shane. I miss the spooky videos
I missed you too
When is part 3 and also I love the videos keep it up
I’m all for Shane trying to come back but using clips from that “psychic demonologist” last frontier woman ain’t the way🤷🏼‍♀️
The music at 24:17 pleeeeaase
I love this new series!I don't want it to ever end!☺👻💀👀👾👽👃👣
Shane I'm so happy you're back
I despise,  the whole “antic-dote.. pause… overt laughter” in every single scene of every single video.
Every time I see an animal I can hear Shane’s boner grow 5%.
ugh i love them sm
Shane! At 3:15 you can see the license plate. Just a heads up. 💜
The cancel bandwagon switched to another person 🤣
The Tik Tok challenge is called “Devious Licks” and the kids have moved on to assaulting teachers/faculty. My best friend teaches at a high school and this has really affected her mental health. It needs to stop!!
I love Shane sm, my brother and I used too always watch him. my mum loved him too. I haven't watched the video yet but I can't wait!
I randomly found your channel and enjoyed the content 😊🤗
Morgan is really pretty
Yessss
Rylands dad is boss man yessssss sir ban tiktok #bantiktok 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣✌
The editing was confusing,  and overall the way you talk about the history of the Park is really inappropriate.  You can't make Jokes about those things..
Welcome back Shane! 👍😁
That disclaimer in the beginning reminded me of Michael  Jackson's thriller
always trending, i’m glad he’s back
i feel as though there’s tension between shane and ryland over this move
At minute 6:39 Shane asks where’s Morgan and mama ryland says, “SHES UP IN HER ROOM” BUT I THOUGHT the realtor that sold Shane and ryland their home was MORGANS realtor. AKA SHE SOLD MORGAN A HOUSE!!! IF THATS THE CASE, WHY IS SHE STILL LIVING AT HOME!!!   Can someone explain to me what the heck is happening!!!!!! AND AT MINUTE 8:14 ryland clearly states that she is LIVING WITH HER PARENTS!!!
It ended unexpectedly.. I was hoping to see you go to the bridge in the end... Can't wait to see your trip to the bridge🥺
This is my shane
This is perfect for the Halloween also I love Chris and the joke he makes. Its always more fun when the person behind the camera is also entertaining and fun.
You've no idea how glad I am you're back!❤️
*FOREVER CANCELED!*
this vid is heavily appropriating indigenous stories but sure, trust the dude with a r*cist past to cover it with sensitivity 🤪🥰💕  edit: waiting to see how long it takes for this comment to disappear like the others lmao
was the annoyingorange ever gone?
Shane baby , I need the last part ....this is lit af
Shane, audio is abit too much this time when talking about the park. Love the rest xx
Meow?
Dad need his own segment lmao !!
Rylands family seem so loving 🥺🥰🥰
Morgan looks so beautiful 🤩🤩 her story telling is epic .. had us all drawn in ..welcome back Shane welcome back !!!
Perfect series for Spooktober. Welcome back, Shane!
So happy you’re back!!
This is the first time I've seen a Shane Dawson video since like 2010 and what happened to shanaynay??
Everybody forgot? K.
We love you Shane 💖💖💖💖
I love how everyone is so shocked that the park is build on top of a cemetery. Meanwhile I live in Paris, the entire city is build on top of the catacombs, and there are more people buried in it than people actually living in Paris.
Maybe it wasn't Shane with the talent. Starting to think his old cameraman helped alot.
Its Saturday morning, drinking coffee, under my blanket, watching this and it is everything i needed after a horrible work week. p.s Morgan looks so gooood!
I was doing my makeup while watching this and next thing I know my back starts burning around the time they started talking about third bridge. I pull my shirt up and see 3 scratch marks on my back… I’m scared
I would love to see @shane and mykie @glamandgore hunting ghosts together 🙈
Welcome back !!!
I'm so happy they mention the sand creek massacre alot of people don't even know about it
My sons school was shut down cuz of it. Now they're challenging kids to slap a teacher and the governor was at my sons school yesterday because of it.
Why are the ghosts ALWAYS from around the 1800s???? Where are all the ghosts from other timeperiods?????
The editing on this 👌🏾 spectacular
gov. polis actually just signed an executive order rescinding the proclamations given by territorial gov. evans in 1864 to “kill and destroy...hostile” Native People. so nearly 157 years after the orders they’ve finally been rescinded. several coloradans are currently petitioning to rename mount evans, which was named after john evans.
SO GLAD SHANE IS BACK!
God I am so glad you’re back, I missed you so much
I've been there twice at night with my best friend and we saw nothing at all! Only thing was a repeated "ting" sound but it could've been the houses next to the bridge 😔
Morgan is looking so beautiful! Amazing aura coming from her
I haven't missed you
Can Morgan be my bestie 🥲💖
YOUTUBE has never been more exciting. I LOVE this! Glad to see you back Shane!
Rylands dad: “ We closed down high schools all over bathrooms”
Im sure shane doesn't know who is elon Musk if he knows then he will stop making this series
I guess the ghost wanted Shane to get uncancelled
shane is scarier than this video
AHHHHHH SHANE CAME BACK AND HALLOWEEN'S RIGHT AT THE CORNER!!! I CAN'T
So frickin happy right now 🙌
scalped no wig snatched yes
Every time I watch his scary conspiracy I turn my lights on  and get paranoid 😩 n look around I be feelin it too much 😭
Need part 2 ASAP😫
Can we appreciate Morgan for telling the story
Dear Shane, you can't even imagine how happy I am to see your content. Best regards, Sonia :D
I missed this so much
I needed this today Shane. ❤️❤️
When I was in high school someone moved one of the toilets in the girls room off the plumbing and before they could fix it several different people used it.  It’s not just for TikTok, teenagers are wild.
You're back
Chris has some insanely funny laughs! He either sounds like he's gasping for air or he sounds like he's the evil villain in a movie who is about to murder someone! LOL! Love him!
I remember when he used to do incredibly offensive content. Those were the awesome Days
I wouldn’t believe anything Omar says anyway. He’s fake AF
He keeps removing my comments COWARD
We missed you 😮‍💨
Probably the first time I see ryland scared in a Shane video
Shane keep removing my comments coward u kno it’s true, no one misses you
i missed you a lot
hello :)
I think it's really important for everyone to know that you can call 911 even if you have no phone service!!! (referring to Morgan's story of a car following her) Stay safe!!

im sorry this is so boring. i love morgan but why are u tryna drag this out so much, just go to the place
I’m really happy this platform is being used to share some facts about indigenous Americans. May their lives never be forgotten.
p3d0, we aint forget
GAY Shane is back after he break up with Jeffree Star. Cringe
The whole Kendall Rae reference had me dying 😂😂😂 I love hers and your channel 🤍
Me and my sister were literally talking about how we missed Shane! SO glad he is back!! We have missed you!!!
Forgot how annoying Shane's editing was
Also my critique would be to PLEASE LOWER the sounds effects like at 11:40. It hard to understand when people are talking especially when you’re quadrilingual
Morgan looks so beautiful 😍
The fact this has 1 5 mil in 1 hour
PLS?? what was that fucking edit on the devious licks stuff
Having Shane be in Aurora Co is insane to me cause I live here and Aurora Co sucks!! 😭😭😂😂
Glad you’re back Shane 🧡🖤
why the fuck you come back from a year long break and start talking about the deaths of native americans for fun??????? tf
The only thing that's scary is how easily people forgive Shane for all the crimes he did 🙄
Hide your kids hide your animals... cause shane dawson is back ..... oh noooo
Last time I went to third bridge I got so scared I literally lost my breathe and my heart dropped because I saw something.
This guy should be in JAIL for wht he did !!!
Notice how all the positive comments are White people :) this is why I can't trust yall
Im SCREAMING SHANE I WILL HAVE YOUR BABIES FOR YOU N RYLAN😂😂😂 BUT ill keep you Shane 💋💋😂😂
Shane ! So happy your back !🤗💕

Loving this series, it feels like old Shane (pre- beauty guru drama era). So happy Daddy Shane is back just in time for Spooky Season!!  🖤 🧡👻⚰🪦🕯😈💀🧡
I’m honestly so happy to see Shane back on the internet, my comfort YouTuber is back and I’m happy again ️️
I’m too high for this
He's back!!!!!!!!!!!
You can tell that I’m from El Paso and Teller counties, cause I’ve never heard of any of these places. Lol.

shane we missed uuuu
Shane I literally love you don’t leave again
watching this in the dark... in a haunted and abandoned military barrack... I missed these theories with Shane...
Pls come back Shane don’t listen to the haters
It’s 2:04 am. Ugh.
This man used to get 10M views in one day what happened 😩
Meow meow
The park with bodies buried under it, there’s also one like that in san diego, near old town. But the creepiest part, its right next to an elementary
I love these Docu series. So happy Shane is back to scare the daylights out of us..🤭
UMMMM MY GRANDPARENTS ARE FROM AURORA WTF. MY MOM WAS BORN THERE HOLY SHIT
Damn I missed these
I know Shane has been a bit messed up in the past, but ngl, I’ve missed these videos. They’re some of the only videos I am interested in..
"Is gramma coming?"  Ryland- "she wouldn't hear them coming." 🤣🤣🤣💀💀
I seriously had to STOP watching as soon as the medium mentioned the trench coat hat man, CHILLS. So many stories of him here in Saskatchewan, Canada.
this is what i need after a long week at work! ♥
I just love this ❤️
I am a 44 year old female. I was turned on to Shane Dawson via my teenage son about two years ago. He mentioned him and I wasn’t super present on YouTube. I watched the videos based on a couple years ago to have a thing in common with my son and something to engage about. I right away liked the content and his humor and his ability to create good videos and editing. The Jeffree Star series came out and my son and myself became obsessed. As soon as a new video came out we were both on watching.  Finally!!! Shane got to a point of what he sooo deserved and made real money from a launch of a product that broke so so many records. Good for him!! Then. Then. The haters come out.  The gen z’s. My son whom turned me on to Shane is one of them and he bought into the hate. Made me mad. Now I’m. Fighting for a YouTuber my son turned me into. I was pissed and backed up the being against cancel culture. My son at the time vowed to never watch again. Then all of a sudden today said “hey, did you see there is a new video from Shane Dawson!”  I said yeah there are actually two and I’ve watched both and so should you. He watched them had totally changed his opinion and can’t wait for episode 3. Good job Shane. From an 44 yr old lady with a gen Z.
i needed this so bad today. THANK YOUUUU
Can we vote the adams family as our royals?? Love all of you. Shane thanks for these videos, we all missed you! Morgan- you’re a stunning queen 👑
me watching this in the morning instead of the night so i can sleep tonight
This series seems kind of bullshit… like is anyone actually scared watching this? I thought they’d do something legit
spooky 👻
These videos are like 70% clips of other people's videos. Does anyone else get fed up of seeing random people talking? lol.
I will always love and support Shane ❤️ HES literally the best !!
See this is what I'm talking about. I missed this so much. I love Rylands family. ❤ Omargosh in the videos!
7:10 *Ryland’s dad: is talking about kids tearing about bathrooms on TikTok* *Shane: did they just run out of dance moves?*  🤣
I am so glad Shane returned just in time for Spooky Season.  Also, I adore how he is trying desperately to be respectful of the Arapahoe and Cheyenne who lost their lives at Sand Creek. 💜 As a Native American myself, this was so nice.
https://youtu.be/NvjxKVcRKXc
More than half of this “vlog” is just recycled content, where’s the originality and creativeness that he wanted to share
Shane came back at the best time. Xx
We want conspiracies
I’ll always love shane
Rest in peace to all the innocent souls that died. I hope they can find their way if all of this is true
morgan has got more gorgeous i love her
Go back Shane we don't want u here 👹
Chris’s laughs annoying im sorry😭😭
Off topic but Morgan is so pretty wow
Is it just me or does anyone feel bad Shane left his mom all the way in California ? :\
oh there are restless souls in a territory were native americans were massacred? who would have thought? Seriously this video is so insensitive and gross
nice
My favorite spooky youtuber is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As a Native American, thank you Shane for acknowledging our history in your videos. Means a lot of the awareness of our horrible past
Oh man I can't wait!!! I need the next episode! Come onn!!!
this series is giving me life.
keep em coming shane
Morgan looks tf good!!! Go off sis!!
I’m arapaho and hearing Morgan talk about my tribe got me excited lmao
yk what got me, may just be me but, they heard the drums? as opposed to trumpets, ifykyk
Grandma is the cutest, she’s funny without trying. I think that just runs in Rylands family. 🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if after this mini series, we're going to have the story-type conspiracy theories.. I really miss those <33
That editing tho
This is what i needed! Is Shane to upload to know my life was alright 🥰❤😥 missed you shane
Can I hang out with Ryland's family? I love them!
Ummmm i live in Colorado and aurora is creepy 🤯🤯
Shane is already curing my mental health. Omg!!!! I’m so fucking happy 😊!!! Jenna Marbles, we love her too! But I think I can make it now
Being bisexual and finding ALL 3 of them attractive is amazing for me lol 💜🥴💜😍💜 I LOVE YOU SHANE!
what is the name of the song played at 22:38
one day maybe please collaborate with Patti Negri?? <3
How are people still watching him??
Not Shane trying to steal bunny’s content 😂🤣 with the paranormal stuff 😂🤣
admit it, *we missed this.*
I’m from Australia and even like my high school bathrooms have been damaged didn’t even know that this was going on in America aswell 😬
I hope all you trash eaters get your fill
I’m honestly so happy to see Shane back on the internet, my comfort YouTuber is back and I’m happy again 😂❤️❤️
i wish you stayed gone
OmargoshTV!! I’m so happy he made a quick cameo
Glad you're back ❤️
Im So happy to be watching videos from Shane again!! Gosh I really missed u!!
I love how rylands dad is talking about devious licks the whole time
I have really enjoyed the past 2 videos and I love to hear and see about ghost stuff so can't wait for the finale!! 💚🧡💜
I'm 10 minutes in and already just the family conversation is amazing. Ryland's dad is hilarious.
I dislike cancel culture a lot, but Shane Dawson is one of the people who legitimately deserved to be canceled.
I don't think Morgan meant trunk. I think what she's referring to is what hatchback cars have, we used to call it the back-back as in the front seat, the back seat and the back-back. Sitting in the back-back you're directly behind the back seat and can peek over the back of the back seat. You aren't inside a small compartment in the dark away from the rest of the passengers and driver.
So I didn’t expect to get this scared…I live in Capitol Hill next to Cheesman Park and knew about the bodies but didn’t realize how deep it went.
I’m just a big old white man tryna show the creepy spookys 😂😂😂
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Oh gosh Grandma she's too funny ..Shane is almost crying like gram is like yeah your going to die oh my hahaa on a funny but I guess morbid lol but hey she can't hear well aww!! Lol ... I love all you guys and to FINALLY SEE SHANE BACK LEGIT I CRIED ! WE ALL LOVE YOU SHANE!! EVERYONE ONE YOU GUYS ! CANT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ONE! YAYY!! 💥💥♥️🤎♥️💥💥
Why am I gonna watch this at night when I know I'm gonna get the shit scared out of me? Sheesh
SHANEE !! : Can you come to indiana and do a video on hauntings here, This was indigenous land and they’re were so many deaths, Also indiana was built on limestone which holds energy !!
If Shane and Ryan went to third bridge, shane would offer Ryan’s heart for peace 😂
Im so happy ur back
I’m so happy rn
I literally love how Mama Adam's went too. She is a gangsta! 😆 🤣 And Dad Adam's coming in hot wth the tea!! Lol I am so glad you're back Shane!
plz do more conspiracys and dont listen to haters
Love this❤️
why do i feel like all the bad comments were deleted :/
it's called a DEVIOUS LICK BRUCE
I need to go and check on something outside at night... Yea I think I'm gonna do it BEFORE watching this episode lol. I know afterwards I'll be afraid to go into the next room. Ahh, the greatness of Shane's videos.
i dont fuck with demons and sky guy but I summoned a whole ass church choir before watching this video.
I'm so glad your back Shane!! I really miss when you made the creepy conspiracy videos.
Ryland's dad is the GOAT LOL
Im so happy you're doing videos again. Love all you guys together. I hope Shanes Mom is well. I like her in vids too
Just commenting to say Im happy to have you back Shane 🥰
Shane being back is a sign that cancel culture is dumb. He absolutely deserves this comeback and I for one is STOKED he's uploading again.
Why did they blur Nathan’s face !?
Dearest Shane and Morgan,  My children love your videos and i was wondering how to explain to them what a “kiki” is. They have been repeatedly asking and quite frankly I’m not going to watch the full video to answer the question.  Thanks in advance, kindest regards,  A concerned mother
when he said cali is very toxic i immediately agreed
@youtube please promote this more!!!
I wonder why Daniel Hungate's photo is blurred? Out of respect?
I love the creepy background music
Life is about forgiveness. If us as human beings can never grow from our mistakes and life choices than how can we better ourselves? Shane grew up in a time when technology was starting to boom. New social media sites were blazing into society. Being viral was limited to a news clip or article. Just as television from the earlier times to now has matured in their dialogue, the same goes to social media. Shane has accepted what he has done was wrong. Allow him to show us. YouTube grew up with Shane and Shane with YouTube. They both have had a bad past of ignoring social mishaps. I’m happy to see Shane back.
Morgan is so damn beautiful
You showed OmarGoshTV!! So cool.
Grandma needs a YouTube channel!
Morgan looks a lot like Ella Henderson
I can have a happy spooky season now :)
Daddy's a WEIRDO 27:11
I thought they canceled this guy
Bro my sister said i should stop watching u cause of younger u making jokes but i know u have grown up and wont say anything like that anymore i just wanna see you post and be happy like back in the days
Rylands dad is unusually obsessed with those bathrooms hahahaha
I’m so happy Shane is back!
Welcome back Shane!  Glad to see your in good health!
The park is what freaks me out. The desecration of thousands of graves??? 13 ghosts, more like 13,000 ghosts.
I don’t think it’s disrespectful, especially since you guys educated yourself about it first. It would be a nice gesture for you to donate some of the income from this video to a fund supportive of native Americans though. Just an idea. Love the content you’ve been making, Shane, and I can’t wait for more! :)
I've missed your content, I've missed you and your humor. I'm so glad you're back. It feels like old times, only it gets better every time. Missed everyone. MORGAN LOOKS AMAZINGG! Lol love yall 💓
love seeing Ohmargosh 🤍
Rylands mom trying to cancel Shane again so your doing this thing 😂😂😂
If the next video is not an hour long,im not watching 🖐🏻😩 Love you ❤️
Love you Shane! So happy you are back
I think Vicky got a little crush on Chris
Morgan looks like Khloe Kardashian
Yay !!! So happy to see u back !!!
Overwhelming success. Shane people never really hated you. It was just people were upset but I thibk lost of us forgive you
I love that they have a Boston Terrier!
why did i get a disney chancel ad?
Awesome show
Shane needs to go to Roche Harbor in the San Juan islands and do a video about the McMillen Family - feel like he would love that
If these videos were 3 hours long each I'd still watch them 😩
He's Back....
Shane…… my Dad passed this week and it’s the most pain I have ever been in. I have to say, you came back to the internet at the perfect time for me. Thank you. I grew up watching your videos and I’m so glad I can watch you again during this rough time. Thank you for all that you do 💙
Why did I decide to watch this 11 at night ? By myself ? Home alone 😂🧟‍♀️🙊
i’d be the single friend in the trunk
Omgg my math 8th grade math teacher was in the news and in ur video 😭😭
OK BUT THANK YOU SHANE FOR NOT ONLY COMING BACK....BUT FOR DELIVERINGGGGG
Ryland's family is 💜
We literally just learned about this in my history 207 class
“ things follow me Chris..”  You can tell he was thinking of a lot more than just ghosts when he said that..
Bro someone stole the toilet in my school…
25:02 She's literally just using the drums from Blur - Song 2
There’s so much more to the third bridge story, like the school bus that flipped and suicides. Also people stopped going because the man who lives down the road got tired of hearing screaming kids all night and started calling csp.
I am so happy that your back!! I've missed you and everyone!! I love you guys!
The way you said creepy spookies has me rolling😂😂 I missed your energy. It's like getting the warmest internal hug from your moms chicken noodle soup. It makes everything feel better. You're so talented without even trying. Sending you lots of 💜💜 Proud of you homie 💜
men will literally blame ghost for their problems before taking self responsibility lmao
Omg omar gosh lol
Wait whare is part two? I saw one and now it says part 3
Shane needs to disappear before it gets worse bro.
I like Morgan but the fact she moved back to Colorado and includes her family in everything is why I stopped watching her. Hopefully Shane and Ryland don't lean on mom and grandma as much as she does going forward.
With all the stress in my life I needed the laughs, Thanks! ❤
grandma is a MOOD  girl boss
"I believe he's from the 1800's" - that old chesnut.
Can we talk about how good Morgan looks!! Sis is glowing😍
WE LOVE KENDALLRAEEE
Morgan did a great job narrating the video!
leave
Kendall Rae is the queen
I am so glad ur back Shane. I have missed ur videos ur AWESOME!! nd u are right ur past is ur past.

shane im begging PLS PART 3 PLSS
Shane literally came back when we needed him the most
Okay but can we just keep this series going as long as possible?? These videos are life.
Even though I’m fully subscribed and notified, I didn’t even see this come up in my subscription feed. I had to scroll way down. Only found it through Peter Monn. Hopefully the algorithm learns quickly. Apparently it hasn’t heard of sabbaticals.
Hello,😁 this is not an attack but I want to share the Gospel to you.❤  Sin entered the world by Adam and Eve's distrust and disobedience towards God. The sins that they had committed caused physical and spiritual death to everything, including humanity and also separated all mankind from God(spiritual death). As God deemed this situation unfit, he sent his one and only son(Jesus) to come to the world and give all who believe in Jesus eternal life. He did this out of LOVE.❤ On this earth Jesus lived a sinless life, facing every temptation known to man. Jesus willingly and unjustly was beaten and put on a cross, bearing the sins of all upon himself.( mind you Jesus is 100% God and 100% of man, and Jesus is God because God is only one deity...if you need help understanding you can comment below) Jesus' death was the payment of sin for those who would believe in Him as their savior. The reason why he had to die was because of God's righteous wrath towards sin that was pointed towards us but God mercifully and graciously let Jesus be in our role. Christ's death also makes us holy and blameless in the sight of God when we believe. Then 3 days after his death, he was resurrected by God from the grave giving victory over sin and death once and for all who believe in Jesus Christ.  The things that we do that mess up/destroy our lives, we now have a way to overpower them in Christ. We are new creations in Jesus, the old unpleasant stuff has permanently passed away and we have a new future full of genuine purpose. Following Christ will not be easy but God is with you and will help you by the guidance and strength of the Holy Spirit. God is a father to those who believe in Jesus Christ.
Glad that Shane’s back. But will I be terrified if I watch this tonight? Yes, but this is a craving I can’t deny.
Does Bruce work in a school? My dad is head of maintenance at our local school and it’s been hell.
Here for the creepy spookies 👻 I love Ryland's family, they definitely seem like amazing people. I wanna see what spookies Shane comes up when he does his own shit.
I already miss the hour long videos
Love it !
Morgan looked stunning when she first appeared. And always. She looks so good
Back in scaring the hell out of people like always
Sad
the internet was getting so boring but now ur back so we’re all good again ,thank god
Lol I love dad
It's like the reverse of avatar instead of disappearing he has reappeared 🥳🥳🥳
My wife watched the video where you put the lipstick under your eyes and the foundation whenever she is feeling down. Always makes her laugh. I’m glad you’re back.
It's fluffy shane
Well if this isn't just disrespectful
everyone is GLOWING!!!!
YESSSS I MISSED YOU
i’m so happy you’re back shane i love you so much
Okay but they’re all literally glowing 🥰
Yes, love that you are back!!!! Missed you both so much
Mentioning the American Holocaust and you guys still went there.. It's like going to Auswitchz for the "spookies"
Me laying down eating my day old mcchicken enjoying this magnificent video❤️
boomers
The dad❤️
I've missed you ,Shane so happy you are backkk 💖😭
Well I just wasted 34 mins, and 55 secs of my life.
i’ve never been so excited in my life shane i missed your vids so much
Having an anxiety filled evening. Things are just so damn hard. Post panic attack laying in bed watching Shane. This is literally the only joy in this day.
Leviticus 20:13
I missed you Shane I’ve been watching you since I was in 6th grade, I’m really happy you’re back you’ve been my idol for a long time, I’ve really missed you and your videos! Thank you for coming back you made my year!
We need hottie Austin in the videos .😏
Spooky theories for the spooky seasonn, so glad to see shane back.
I heard about a couple kids who broke off a stall door broke off a few panels in the roof and then shoved the stall door up there! By themselves like five or six of them
What’s bothering me about the comment section is that people are willing to give views for something they don’t like or agree with....chose a fucking side and stay there like wtf. If you don’t like him WHY waste your time watching and commenting???? Dick riding is at an all time high!!!
Can you leave the internet again , it was better here without you.
Omg could you guys get on drunk history?? Lol
Wait...he's back?....HES BACK AHHHH OMG FINALLY  2021 HAF SOMETHING  GOOD
everytime a slideshow of different videos saying the same thing comes on my brain literally shits off cuz it cant keep up. ADHD things i guess idk, either way, probably could use alot less of that and free up 20 minutes to new information. I love the long vids, but bruh we need more stimulation.
Are we gonna have a video with all the thing you have see at the bridge ?
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like they’re super haunted after watching shanes videos but u have the same humour so u laugh if off w him lmao
'the most important bodies, those who could afford it were moved first' 'the remaining people were criminals and bad people'. poor = bad, got it lmao
👏🏻 NEVER 👏🏻 LEAVE 👏🏻 ME 👏🏻 AGAIN 👏🏻
Filtering the comments huh? What are u afraid of Shane CANT with this dude we haven’t forgiven him
Im in love with Morgan.. she is amazing!!!
Can y'all please stop talking shit on California/ LA y'all don't like it but yet love being out here.  It blows my mind that the people that save up their money to come and move out here and move back home are the ones that talk the most shit on LA you guys come here and try to be someone you're not & THATS WHY IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.  Next time try being who you really are and maybe you're like it. People from Colorado shouldn't even be talking y'all full of KILLERS Now on with the video 📹
OMG I MISSED YOU
They are definitely filtering the comments
I love this video!
What happened to everyone understanding and holding him accountable for his actions all of a sudden we decided to stop caring about his actions because we enjoy his content now?
Shane, pls don’t ever leave us again! This content is amazing! There’s so many ppl that are so proud of u, and I’m one of them!!! Keep up the good work!
first date kikis!!!
https://youtu.be/7zkgVzkHQ9w
shane i am glad you are back i missed you 🥰😘
I’ve learned more American history in this one video than I ever did in school and that says a lot lol
I can’t with the camera mans laugh 😂
Shane literally came back when I needed him most and with FIRE CONTENT!!! IM SO EXCITED FOR THESE TYPES OF VIDEOS!!! Been here since day one love you so much you’ve saved my life without even knowing it!❤️
I saw the notification and I was like shhhaaannnnneeeee I havent seen this bitch in awhile 👀❤️
Any Illuminati?
I am not a believer but HOLY SHIT Shane really knows how to sell a story. He’d be a great sales person
1 Morgan is HOTTTTTT like okay queen and 2 I love Chris’s energy and how engaged he is with everyone but omggggg the shakiness of the camera gives me such a headache but I’m sure it’ll get better when he gets more use to it.
I love most of omars haunted exploration videos too 😭💕
Uhm can we please check on that man that casually licked a BATTERY?!
Cheese man park is the sesh spot
You need to do a video with Brittany Broskis Mum!!
Shane really needs chapstick. It blows my mind how ashy his lips are in every video
no no no who tf said you were welcomed back
Denver person here- ran around Cheeseman park for YEARS- night and day- always safe!
Bro stop deleting negative comments, it's not helping your case to keep on deleting them
💕💕
Okay I know I’m supposed to hate Shane but ngl I really missed his videos
I was so excited for this video and it’s finally here !! Who cares about my homework this is 1000x better lmao
I'm so glad to see you back Shane, you have been so missed.   I love that you and Rylands are out of California it is toxic.  Rylands family always seems to be laughing and joking and loving on the 2 of you. You deserve all the happiness you can get. Much love from Western North Carolina.
BRUCE ADAMS IS AN ICON!!!
I missed you boo boo
YOURE FINALLY BACK WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH SHANE❤️
I’ve never gave up on you and so happy you came to save our dark days
I agree with rylands dad... my son said the maturity level of these kids is sad. He said soap dispensers,urinals, everything is damaged and it gets old fast.
Shane your amazing thank you for comming back
Devious licks😈

i am so happyyyyy that shane is back omfg i can not tell you how much i check to see if he uploaded i literally cried when i got the upload notifications i love shane so much its my dream to meet him
Just came here after actually sobbing my fucking eyes out for the last hour.. thanks Shane   :,)
Yasss he is back love ya Shane btw while u were gone I became Demisexual and gay 😩💅🏻
Shane, you need to do a haunting travel tour, go to the most haunted places in America. Have one fan or two who lives in each state you visit give you the details of their states haunted places. One being South Carolina. 😊
If you support Shane you are genuinely disgusting
I'm still on the fence wether I can forgive and forget what you've done, but I'm glad you made this video
So y’all really just forgot about what he’s done huh?
why is no one talking about 18:37 I'm absolutely dead
I love rylands family they’re all so sweet
all the top comments are bots 💀
the never ending montage was annoying .
That Kendal Rae reference / joke 👌🏿
chill with the background noise music goddamn wtf
My birthday is November 29th 😅
🤌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 The king of suspense !
Omg next video: Columbine tour
Jesus my soul left my body with that thing at the very very end!!!!
No ma’am
I’ve never missed a YouTuber so much…thanks for coming back Shane
I love morgan
Denver really is fucking wacky haha and the airport lets not forget !!!!!
This is remarkably terrible. Please stop making content.
im so happy ur back we missed u <3
Missed You!
Why did they blur Daniel's face? Somebody explain please🤔
Morgan looks so good
I missed you ❤️
Anyone else notice those “ tacos “?
Whitest most privileged moment on YouTube thanks to Ryland: "How did this happen, it's the middle of nowhere!" Native Americans: "Uhhh bruh?"
I have missed Shane so much. I feel like I relate to him more then anyone else on this platform. And he makes me laugh a lot.
Shane! I would love to share some scary stories with you 👻
Shane, why you needed to put Omar fckn Gosh in your vodeo is mind boggling 🙄  he is the fakest of the fckn fake... he's the epitome of i need likes sooo let's dress my wife in a brides dress and tell ppl its all real scumbag.... wtf...whyyyyy?!?  You're better than his bullshit.....
Does anyone know the background music at 23:17
The whole reel of the back story of the park gave me the heebie-jeebies 😳
Morgan: is grandma coming Ryland: I mean she wouldn’t hear them coming!!  😂😂😂☠️ I’m sorry but I bursted out laughing. Lmao
S/O to Morgan at 21:00 for saving Ryland’s ass,  you don’t take girls to a place with no service to make it more likely and use that factor as intimidation to be with you
Okay first.. Happy to have shane back. Second.. been crushing on Morgan and I'm glad everyone fucking sees it now
Absolutely stunning. No doubt.
I love Shane's videos ❤
Imagine getting canceled but your trending again yassss Shane ❤️❤️
So glad your back
I cant express I’m words how much I love this
They shut down the boys bathrooms at my school because of vandalism . They half to use one that’s in the schools office now and over half of the students that go to my school are male .
YAYYY HES BACK
SHANE YOUR BACK HI😄
"The little shit taking a piss..." my GOD I DIED. I love rylands dad
as an indigenous person, this is incredibly insensitive and shitty. shane needs to be deplatformed. he clearly hasn't learned anything.
MORGAN IS A 10/10
Worst thumbnail i think ive ever seen
This really feels like a movie
Okay soooo.... you're NOT going to Cheesman Park?
This editing is so good. I see some real talent in shane and his movie dreams
Honestly love Morgan 💞
YB better
Shane looks scuffed and Morgan is chubby >.>
Morgan be THICC!!!
Taxpayers money to these damn schools just to have ur kids go and rip it all apart
Ryland and Morgan’s family is so pure.
Shane was totally problematic back in the day. I stopped following him because of it, but came back after he grew up and started making stuff like this. I'm here for the growth and to enjoy his talent. I'm looking forward to more series like this and more!
That laugh lol 🤣
Just leave tobacco near a tree or bridge and smudge when you get home then you should be fine. 🤗
THE ANNOYING ORANGE IS BACK
It isn’t your fucking place to talk about the atrocities committed against the Indigenous people. This is so exploitative that it makes me sick.
I love love!!! I am full blood Native American.. Thank you for bringing it to light of the horrible things Native Americans have gone through..I feel like Native Americans have been forgotten about. I love you and your videos!!! I am so happy to see Bruce come into more of the videos!!!
That camera guy needs to chill. I swear he ruined this video for me. I was just waiting for that laugh every moment.  That's too much. Ok once in a while but every time.
Some people have no respect for the dead. That’s so sad 😭
For the record, it’s Nathan Hungate and he refused to shoot the women and children!
So glad to see that you’re back.. WE TRULY MISSED YOUUU..!!! 😭💖💖
Yay more uploads
I’m going to rewatch these until more come out
https://youtu.be/pmvtliYEhdY
https://youtu.be/pmvtliYEhdY
Dude shane dawsons literally becoming one of those 3 am calling videos
Rylands dad is  mood 😂
You should visit the columbine high school
I love you Shane.
My son is a custodian at a junior high and that challenge was brutal for him. The worst being a soap dispenser thrown into the toilet, and pooped on! He mentioned there was no use of toilet paper....
Scalping natives was very common. Watch gone with the wind. They would get money for every scalp they got.
Conspiracy theories about covid plz!/?
Omg I missed him so much I can’t wait to see more uploads from you
The most haunted theory is your weird infatuation with kids
Am I the only who thinks Morgan is perfect 😍 she a lil thicky and beautiful ❤️
Ummm can we talk about how awesome rylands family is!! I absolutely love his mom dad and grandma. Especially his dad! ….”Those little shits” lmao
Omg guys plz collab with Kendall Rae or Mile Higher!! I’m obsessed with the both of you guys!
Tell your followers about this shane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg3Vnfu4Pk&t=1882s
Not a haunted place called CHEESEMAN PARK😂
So happy you’re back ❤️ only the true fans waited for this moment and didn’t jump on the hate train
Shane: I’m ready to squash…. Welcome back.   Me: choked on chocolate milk and it came out my nose.
morgan... accountant or accountable? either is cool but just wondering what you meant....
We love you Shane! Welcome back.
Grandma is a vibe
When will white people stop profiting off of indigenous tragedies?
I actually just remembered how much I love shane
Yass new upload I love your vids shane ✨
I don't understand how you're constantly joking about native genocide. It's disgusting.
The amount of ppl that have switched up on Shane blows my mind, he’s still the same dude as he was before
Every time you post my life is ruined even more, demon
Are you gonna start doing conspiracy theories again?
Can't wait for part 3 glad your back.
Morgan is back 😍😍 oh yeah and shane too
we miss u, shane!! <3
i really needed this thanks for having the strength to come back after all the shit man, your real fans know you not the same person you were 10+ years ago 💕Everyone is capable for change and helping inspire change in others!
He’s back!!!! 🙌🏽🙀
omg i think i’m in love with morgan she’s literally so beautiful OMG AHHH
WHY IN MY CITY? AURORA ALREADY SUCKS BRO I DIDN’T NEED TO REMEMBER HOW DISTURBING IT IS IN SOME PLACES!
These last two videos seem much more genuine
They killed hundreds of thousands of First Nations people. And even after all that, and what native people have bin through, they don’t want revenge. They just want recognition. So who really is the more civil one here…
I missed this ! 😂
O native genocide funni funni genocide funni disrespectful jokes funni funni
I love how Shane asks a room of white people if it’s okay if he profits off of the massacre of native Americans lol
😟
“I hope the little shit takes a piss and then we will find out who it is” 😂😂😂OMG I LOVE RYS DAD WE NEED MORE OF IT
I HAVE MISSED YOU ALL (together) SO MUCH I CANNOT EXPLAIN
Love love love yoou
You have no idea how happy your videos made me ❤️ after a hard year it feels great to see a familiar face who has always made me smile thank you Shane ❤️❤️❤️
YES SHANE
Yay! I am so happy omg. We missed you Shane
I HAVE AN ORAL REPORT I SHOULD BE WRITING/PRACTICING FOR BUT INSTEAD I AM WATCHING THIS! SHANE IF I FAIL ITS ON YOU BESTIE!
Who doubts they’ll actually catch any ghosts on camera or we’ll actually see any paranormal activity outside of scratching noises and chest pressure? ✋🏻
Been going to the third bridge for years, place is weird for sure, I have many stories
The fact that you came back with a creepy 3 parter during spoopy season is everything! ❤💀👻
When they talking about devious licks, I knew what we did😈
So bloody disrespectful to build ontoP of buried graves. This is not what the people laid to rest there or their families would wish for
Gross.
Glad to see you back, Shane!
Marty, I’m scared.
8:05 most relatable shit ever
Love how Rylands dad said he thinks Cali is toxic. Preach queen. Nothing like being around good family and good vibes. I'm glad to see you guys happy.
Im just so excited for Shane and i love how all the comments are just full of love that how much we missed u
Rylands dad telling it like it is! LA is toxic; so toxic it warps your whole perspective of self and daily reality
Glad to have you back!
Love you all xx
We love how people forget he’s a monster
Why the hell is the fucking creep is back on.
Bundy did some things in Colorado too, but omg we missed you!
*u suxj=/ cuz
I love Ryland's reaction to Shane at 27:32 like he loves him to death and is just shakes his head when Shane makes silly jokes lol
This is just pure trolling.... still. Dang contents kinda slacking for that long of a break imo
Shane i got a story for you. My dad apparently when to high school with a guy who murdered his own grandma with a hammer...
If they’re going to the 3rd bridge in Parker I got so much anxiety going there. I heard Native American drumming and that’s as long as I could stay. I was GONE after that
Rylands dads commentary is everything 🤣
Morgan looks SO GOOD
sooo weird to hear them mention King Soopers😂
i absolutely HATE this. how dare you come back. disgusting. you should have stayed off the internet FOR GOOD
Did ryland just say he used to take girls out there to scare them into making out with him? Fucking YIKES
Shane’s back, my life’s complete.
came to dislike <3
Petition for the next series to be all about Bruce and his take on big events
Grandma: I’ll be seeing ya.   Shane: In the after life 😳🔦  🤣😂🤣
Completely irrelevant but totally necessary - Morgan is BEAUTIFUL
I love that your back shane!!! You was missed❤
Shane!  I’ve missed you!
I’ve been needing this lately
When he used Omar Gosh as a source I just disintegrated. He’s so fake smh
this is f....up but cool great job guys
They all look so much happier Colorado.
There’s so much like editing and stuff I can’t focus on one thing so im like uhhhhhh
A video by Shane Dawson appears in my feed after all this time.  What the fuck?
Don’t get me wrong I’m excited for Shane content, but this was 75% other people’s videos in a compilation. Annoying af
I'm here for iiiittttttt
Hey, missed your face.
Happy to see these videos again.
I have been a fan for years and usually don't say anything but im so glad your making content again. Brings some laugh to my day
I just learned that colonizers would go and scalp native Americans, and sell the scalps for some kind of power. That’s where we get the term “redskins” because of the piles of bodies covered in blood from being scalped
It truly is beautiful to see Shane back in his smile and laugh doing what he was made to do. And when the world is falling apart, and we need the laugh and smile of Shane.
Your the best at spooky videos 📹  please dont stop creating, so many people love your efforts!
Ya someone hit the biggest lick of all they stole a baking teachers car
Ew
is no one going to say how beautiful morgan is like especially @17:11 🥺🤩
I fucking died laughing the way they were talking about it in the first video I was prepared for something actually scary "ooooOOOOoooooooOoooooOooOOOOoo it's a park on top of a cemetery ooooooOoOOOOoOOOOO" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact that you are using the genocide of Native Americans for clicks on a spooky video just shows that you have not changed at all. Show some respect and decency, for fuck's sake.
Scott on tape just did a video about this in California about the parks
I feel like I waited forever for this
After 1 week only 4.5 mil views on previous vid. I wonder if Shane was gone too long. As long as he’s happy. Love his new surroundings.
The zoom on the dog at 20:34 is all I needed from this video. Thank you
FINAAAAAALLLLLY
Yooo OMARGOSHTV!!! I love ittt
:D
There is a road in Vaughan, Canada called Kirby Road and it is haunted. My best friend went a few days ago and a van tried chasing her car away then the van disappeared. And apparently a girl named Selina died there and her ghost is still there or something. Others have died there too in crashes and their tombstones are there. There is a haunted house there called Hell House or something. So if you ever visit Canada, I recommend if you wanna visit Kirby Road and film some of it!
this looks like it was edited by a 12 year old. what is with all the jump cuts? I could not find a more disjointed video if I tried.
Can’t wait for the next installment!
I’m I the only one that loves rylands dad, he’s so funny!
Watching for the second time and admiring Morgan.
The only thing paranormal here is you trying bring your career back from the dead.  Stephen king has made it pretty clear what happens when you don’t let dead things lie…
content=bad, editing makes it watchable?
this reminds me a lot of what we call "satansville" out here in PA
18:37 LMAO I LOVE HIM
Rylands dad omg love him
So we’re ignoring the fact everyone just suddenly forgets what he did?
Morgan is so beautiful wow
This comment section is horrifying and Shane you’re a tone deaf, pity party throwing loser. Do better.
Kinda felt disrespectful how you spoke about the history with the indigenous people. Kinda like you made it a joke. You even admitted that it would be kind of disrespectful to go “ghost hunting” there but still didn’t not care.
currently wearing my spiraling hoodie while watching this series 🖤I love you so much, Shane!
So happy he’s back I just don’t like this new camera guy 😭😂☠️
y'all really gonna just let everything he did go? there is literally video of him kissing a 13 year old in his 20s. disgusting.
Bruce would have an aneurysm if he knew that it’s happening in not only Canada but Nova Scotia
morgan is so pretty omg
Morgan is literally stunning, just sayin’.
Do Riverdale road next!!!!! It's in Thornton!
I’m only watching this video because Morgan is hot as fuck🥴🥴🥴 lip bite emoji*
Off topic but Morgan is GLOWING
Ryland's family is a MOOD
Many stores in the United States have gone bankrupt! Because of long-term losses! Raising prices is the only way to save these stores! If the price is too low, there will be a phenomenon of pouring capitalist milk! So we must raise commodity prices! Maintain market prosperity!
morgan, please stop saying kiki. please lol
I liked the minute they started talking about squashing tik tokers destroying bathrooms 😂
Nah
I’ve missed Shane so much ❤️🥺
You gotta look up fort collins hell tree and Strauss Cabin. Its our own local horror story. That’s where a goat farmer used to hang his workers, until they rebelled and hanged him from the same tree. And now you can see ghosts swinging from the limbs of hells tree after dark. Fort collins is only a hour away from yall and its one of colorados most haunted city's. Rich with dark and blood stained history fort collins had many haunted historical cites and any of its residences will tell u a number of public and private locations known for major hauntings. We even have our own abandoned tunnel system under the city which was closed after it was found to be used for drug trafficing and moving bodies through out the city. One of our biggest cemeteries here you can go to at night and hear womans screams at night and shadows following you between head stones.
So glad you’re back!!!
I have been waiting for a Kendall Rae and Shane colab since 2017!
Good to see your critics have aged into irrelevance.
ugh love this
You started it off like the conjuring with that quote & it literally gave me goosebumps
everyone in these comments a year ago: “BLM” “SAVE OUR CHILDREN” *A year later now that they dont care anymore*: Shane! YASSSS
*hears haunted noise* “oh those are just house settling noises” 😂😂 i remember my mum telling me that after i had seen a couple ghosts in my house to try calm me down 😂
missed your humour and personality :)
Your videos bring so much happiness to such a tiring life
Ryland’s dad cameos cracked me up every time! It’s so good to have Shane back!
I’m NOT watching this until the last one is ready. I want to watch them together and I don’t like waiting. Please hurry my friend. Please.
I swear from your Diyarbakir come back video …. You back just when I needed you 🥰
It’s the bridge from supernatural
i’ve missed this so much
Morgan got really hot
Morgan looks so good omg 😭😭
Bruce is such an ICON
Shane what’s the most haunted place in LA?
thank you for coming back. it’s been a hard month and you always put a smile on my face!
Canceled? Where?! Missed you shane!! 🙌🏼❤️
Rylands dad is hilarious
I'm so happy your back I've been watching you for a long time now and I was so upset when I thought you quit glad to finally have you back 🥺💖
Camera mans laugh triggers my misophonia. I want to vomit and destroy everything around me, at the same time. It fills me with so much rage. I don’t think I’ll be able to watch anymore videos if he is heehawing (with peace and love) into the mic. It’s not his fault… it’s the damn misophonia… but LAWD I CANT HANDLE IT!
I have the same cup as Shane…TWINNNNSSSSS 😂🖤🖤
“I was in science class and my penis caught on fire” 😂😂😂 ryland’s dad needs to be in more videos in the future! love that guy!
YOURE A MILLIONAIRE. DONATE TO INDIGENOUS CAUSES
we didnt forget
we never forgot
Just make it two really good parts. Wack
I’m just a big old white man who wants to show the creepy spookies
Glad ur back Shane
:)))
so excited for the finale
IVE MISSED U TOO
Please go back in hiding , the world was much much better .
Shane is the example that if you are white and rich, you can get away with anything.
I kinda missed Shane… Dont hate me for this, I just like his content
Anyone else feel like this video was literally any other footage but his own?
When he plays footage from every haunting video on yt but can barely make his own😭😭
OMG SHANE
This is the content I need to see 😩 love October
So glad ur back!!😩❤️
I'm not at all a fan of scary stuff but I love  Shane's videos! xoxo
I’m so glad you’re back Shane. Haters gonna’ hate. Keep it up ✌🏻
god i love this also i hope you restock the black water bottle thing i want one so bad it looks so sleek
I missed Shane so much 😘😘😘
When’s the next one!!!!
Shane I have always stay by you !!   I love you ❤️
Rylands dads humor is hilarious 😂😂😂
Omargosh gave you a shout out in his queen mary video and you gave him a cameo! That was so awesome!
I'm so sorry but I cannot stand hearing Chris behind the camera. It is too much
Shane motorboated dogs penis!? :O
SO HAPPY YOU’RE BACK!! I can’t wait for the last episode! Thank you for telling my bloodlines story so respectfully! 💖 I love y’all so much! So wholesome 🥰
I don’t think I’ve ever commented on a video before, and it actually took me nearly a minute to figure out how.. BUT, I am so beyond excited that my FAVORITE youtuber/family is back. The Shane spooks are what I live for! Also, Morgan is looking freaking amazingly gorgeous. Much love 💛
Started watching this about 2am this morning. Got super freaked out and had to stop until now. Lmao. The editing here is amazing.
lets go!!!! Need the finale asap ;)
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU
Good job shane:) I missed you, thank you for being brave enough to come back. Welcome back
Rylands Dad dropping truth!!!
Shane I’ve missed you soooo much. I love your dark ass sense of humor, makes my depression better 💜💜
"Whatever you put on social media will stay there forever"  Shane learned this the hard way
There’s a primary school in my town that is built over a burial ground, it was where nuns were buried and it’s right next to a church
The piano music 🎹 🎶 has me deceased
Missed you too! You are so awesome!
Morgan be looking beau-ti-ful you keep doing you girl 🔥
Shane just came up like telling scary stories or telling the ghost version stories I just couldn’t open one of my eyes right now I just saw a shallow behind Shane oh wait it’s Shane’s shallow walking towards Ryland and Morgan I just left my away over them like I just walk by my side like their side of the story came up lol?  And I couldn’t stop laughing while Shane making that mood face like a shallow version of Shane Dawson around my arms I couldn’t even feel it lol?
THE EDITING IS BEYOND WORDS CAN EXPLAIN OUTSTANDING
Me going to Denver for Christmas for the second time 🧔🏿‍♀️
Ahh finally Shane!!
IN ENGLAND EVERY PARK THAT YOU SIT ON OR PLAY IN WAS ONCE A BURIAL GROUND!! Death gives us Life!
Great to have you back, Shane!! Can't wait to see more of you!
Rylands math at the beginning is like 1+1 = 2
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
WHY IS HE BACK? WE NEED TO CANCEL HIM OUT!
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
GIMME THE REST OF THE VIDEO SHANEEE
Y’all are so goofy to still support someone who never addressed his pedophilia head on 😳😳
Dad is going off in this video 😌🤣😭
If Shane can come back so can Jenna 😔
It’s about fucking time....
Hi Shane and Ryland. Interesting video u might like. End times productions- "they fooled us all" on youtube.  Love u guys. Xo penny
You are an awful looking human being please get a professional shave
why the fuck is he back
this sucks
I couldn’t hear shit
As someone that lives in California I agree we are toxic it’s coo lmao
I've lived in Colorado for so long. I was dying to know where it would be. I feel like Gold Camp Road would be such a cool series too.
I’m sorry but... he’ll never be Adele...
I'VE MISSED YOU TOOOOOOO
You guys should go to Gold Camp Rd in the springs
yeah this is yikes, why didn’t you bother to consult indigenous people
OMG!!!! I NEEDED THIS😍😃😃 SHANE WE LOVE AND HAVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!! Screw everyone else do what makes you happy and your real fans who know you are in no way a malicious person will always be behind you. Thanks so much for this goofy smile on my face. You are the best ❤💜❤
Rylands dad definitely has the Taurus ♉️ energy
Yes thank you!! We missed you shane
Literally just came from an article about a park bathroom being vandalized—$10,000 worth of damage.  Also, Shane & friends…I just moved from CO a year ago and we miss it. Give Colorado a big hug for us!
I don’t think some people realize how real satan/demons are and you have to be careful with this kind of stuff
When the girl telling the story about Cheesman Park said the people left there are “criminals and bad people” simply for being poor was ugly and rubbed me the wrong way. Lol
If you listen “you can hear the drums” yeah if you shut up maybe I will dude 😂😂
Please collab with Kendall 🥺
I'm still disappointed at how you addressed everything Shane and ignored the bulk of things you should have apologised for..... Aaaand Realistically the whole world is a burial ground through time we just keep building on top if we didn't we would run out of planet think of the thousands of generations of humanity the came before us they're all still here... ish
Pleeeease I don't care that ashamed came back but not this ghost Bs stuff. Y'all know that none of them actually believe this and are playing it up because their viewers are kids right?
Taking to long Shane. Your losing a lot of us.
Shane your back!!!! God I missed you
I’m so happy you’re back 😭
GO TO THE CONJURING HOUSE NEXT PLZZZ
I love this whole group lmao Ryan's family is funny AF
love the way you joke about indigenous people being slaughtered! at least you’re open about having learned absolutely nothing and still being an unempathetic, ignorant degenerate.
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it. Never quit youtube you guys!!!
Also in the beginning when the intro started I swear I screamed at the top of my lungs "YAS QUEEN"
SHANE IS BACK!!! 😁💪
I'm loving this, Shane! Especially for bring attention to the atrocities perpetrated on Native Americans peoples.
Shane's editing style is amazing!
This is ok but it’s just x2 episodes of talking … Garret did a class video very similar to this it’s really good !
may the poor innocent souls rest in peace. thank you for bringing light on the slaughter of natives, which is well overdue!
I love Bruce omg
how much did he cash app y’all to comment this sh!t
YESSSSSÅ
How are you even allowed to post still
I'm so hyped Shane is back this month. Halloween wouldn't of been the same 🥰
Can we talk about how pretty Morgan is ..
Love you Shane and I’m so glad your back ❤️
Use bigger letters if using red, or use another background color other than black.
no, leave again
it kinda makes me sad how we never hear about shanes more be keeps saying family but  olny is saying it when he is talking about Rayland's family not his mom or brother
literally love this 😍
I am so happy Shane came back. I was literally waiting for this moment to happen.
I missed old Shane...welcome back!!!
Shane! YouTube is a much better place with you in it! 🥰 please stay.
I remember when I was in my teens people would always pull up to third bridge so everyone would just link up there and meet new people so we never heard anything
No cuz there's no way all of these comments are real they talking like robots.  Anyway leave this site!!!! ❤
So happy you came back when you did. I love looking forward to being curled up in a blanket on a friday night in October watching your videos. I have endless love and appreciation  for you Shane<3
I feel like the whole segment about the cheesman park was kinda pointless. It was a lot of flash for no reason.
DEVIOUS LICK
Ummm Morgan looks FRIGIN AMAZING‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
yay
#4 bitches,,,thats the shit!....  I just hope we don't have to wait several days for part3, DONT FRET over the edit,,,just post that shit shane!, POST IT!,,, xoxoxo
*eats dogs genitals *
I think this is the graveyard Ariana Grande went too
I wish this episode was longer 😩 a whole week now until we actually see them go there
"Im just a big old white man tryna show the creepy spookies" 😂 dead
Aren’t you canceled
Yaaassss!!! I was hoping you would do Chessman Park!!! So fascinating
Morgan fine ass
you make me happy
There's too much drama...... I'm here watching with popcorn how people hate/support shane, cancel culture is just fun amd cringy to watch 😎🍿
love how he still hasn’t properly addressed his racism but will make a video of him going to the cite of a native american massacre
the nostalgia
I love Ryland and Morgan’s family so much!! And Colorado! I get why they moved there
Shane you know exactly how to make videos omg 😳 I loved your videos you made these two you released ! Thanks for coming back ! We love you so much from all my family to yours  may God bless you and much success your my favorite 🤩 thanks for all you do! Love you
LMAO the devious licks
So.. you're just gonna pretend you didn't have a bunch of prepubescent girls twerk for you huh? The clips are still all over the internet Shane lol
That's a sad story of Cheesman Park, but the Boston Common is a pretty similar story. However the Common's bodies that were buried under are mostly from the 1600s.
I love your content! Be safe out there everyone 💜💜💜💜
This man needs to leave again
you guys switch up on him so fast it doesnt change what he did or the excuses he made
I can't hear anything through this background music!! Please make it less loud. I don't wanna miss a word!
devious licks
my mom always knocked and walked like that. never my dad.
I'm an ancestor of the northern Cheyenne tribe.
SO GLAD U ARE BACK
Honestly I would love if if he had his own show and their were seasons. It would be on the tops of my list to binge watch
More more more we need more now! Lol
“Oh it’s dead, like the massacre victims” bro has no chill😭😭
Finally omg something good on YouTube
Shane. Its over. Seriously. You’re too out of touch to make a comeback “still making jokes from 2016:/“  We will miss you but this content is so corny and boring. Good luck man<3
I want to see your animal crossing tour!! Do you have a dream address?
I can’t explain how happy I am too be able to sit down and watch Shane I was re watching his old videos I love the new ones
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Your next conspiracy theory video needs to include the covid vaccines and how they are trying to control us
Why is there literally over five minutes of just random footage…. We get it you’re trying to make it longer but pls make it less obvious and actually entertaining
Seriously love you Shane and the whole family. Such a fun series! So glad you are back! Can’t wait for next week! 🙌🏻
ooooooh spooky
Idc what ppl gotta say I’m soo happy Shane back and posting 🥺❤️
Okay Ryland literally made me scream @ 30:10
I needed this, watched all conspiracy videos a thousand times already
I used to love Shane so much, I just wish he would actually apologize about the stuff he’s done instead of the back handed apology’s he has done over the years. Do better Shane Dawson I know you can I can’t even justify watching your content anymore and it’s heartbreaking.
Repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ to be saved from hell.
WHY ARE U POSTING AGAIN WHAT TGE FUCK WHY IS EVERYONE FORGETTING WHAT HE DID
When Kendall Rae was mentioned I lost it
I grew up on the plains of Colorado, in a tiny town. I was always followed around by the unseen. Welcome to Colorado!
Morgan is literally stunning, such a queen
Born & raised in Denver baby!!!   Let’s goooooo🤟🏻💖💖
I don’t have my post notifications on and forgot you started posting and just woke up and saw this was posted a DAY AGO I’m so happy
Im soo happy your back! and right at the time I move to colorado too!
I can't even hate watch it all the way through bc the editing is just so fucking annoying. they can't talk for 10 seconds without being interrupted by a clip from another video.🙄
Shane I missed you too!!! I love Rylans fam so much
Bruce fast becoming the most hilarious family member!
lets go!
Looking forward to the final part!!! So exited!!! 💕💕💕
Petition to change the G wagon’s name to “The Ghost Wagon” 👻 🚗.
NOT THE DEVIOUS LICK TIKTOKS LMAAOOO
YESSSSSS UR BACKKKK 😭
Morgan just so you know.. if you started doing true crime content like Kendall Rae, I would most definitely tune in!! 💯 like this if you would as well.
is noone going to mention anything he did-
Please continue posting video. I miss you Shane sorry for unsubscribing before
we will never forgive you shane. you will always be held accountable for what you did and your apology was shit.
Please, sir, can I have some more? 🥺🥣
I'm a fan of rylands dad....
Haha this guy is still alive?
I swear Morgan gets prettier in every video!! 😍
Gannon staunch was murdered by his step mom in Colorado last year 😭 I suggest looking the case up
Make moreeeee , I feel at ease watching you again… I lost myself for a year and now I am loving myself again and doing/watching the things I love
You’re more likely to run into Maris the Great at Cheesman Park than anything really scary.
“*lick lick* ugh its dead..like the masacr victims…anyways what im…” 😭
Why are you forsing ghost stories? 😐
when you would post everyday that was my smile of the day when u we’re gone from youtube i couldn’t find that smile but your back now thank you❤️
where's Colby and Sam lil
i miss your videos they are so comforting
A kid did that and recorded running it over with a mower
We missed you FUCK YEAH SHANE!!!
I MISSED YOU
I MISSED
Cameraman laughs like David Dobrik
lets go i have been waiting for this for a year
This makes me happy
i love you!!!
FaMiLy
Farts loudly
who else finds it weird how many good comments there are? i just posted one calling shane out on his past and it went missing hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... :) seems like they're filtering the comment section...
I absolutely love the video but it was really hard to listen to with all the freaking violins in the background
Shane and Adele. The world is saved
I want more of Ryland’s parents!
Scariness aside Morgan looks soo beautiful
Colorado native!!! 💕 and yes cheeseman park is haunted! Seen some weird stuff there!
this video is so bad I expected better for a come back vid lol all the unnecessary edits/cut scenes make it worse
Hey I live in Aurora!
Upper class white people that have no real problems have to actually make up problems in their lives AKA hauntings or demons in order to trigger their adrenaline responyet for there are journal in response to evolutionarily promote their healthy original systems this is ridiculous cancel Saint Shane Dawson again
I just can’t we wanted Shane. Back for soo long and when we need him the most he comes back love you Shane ❤️
Brilliant 😃😃
Shane I’m so happy you’re back and doing well! But please change your shirt! You’ve been wearing it for weeks now!!!
I'M SO HAPPYYYY WTF
Shane if you want to go to another creepy place and investigate supposedly Riverdale Road in Thornton Colorado is known to be haunted!!!!!
So happy you are back, Shane! I've missed you so much. Loving this mini series. I hope you continue to do more, friend. I hope you are proud of yourself for being so brave and making a comeback. I know I am proud of you! 🖤
If you would have just stayed doing your conspiracy videos everything would have been great
I like how Shane Dawson get's cancelled every year for the same thing lmao. Makes no sense at all.
#everychildmatters 🧡🧡
WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT
You’re #3 on trending!!
I’m honestly so happy Shane is back. I am really upset that I have had notifications turned on (never turned them off) and just found out he came back due to not showing on my feed. Shane you look incredible and so happy to see you moving forward! Rooting for you over in Ohio! Thank you for bringing back your amazing content👏🏻
Hi shanne!!! I am soo happy you are back. I've been a fan for so long but hey everyone isn't perfect and make mistakes. But isn't that what every human goes thru famous or not. But if you grow from it and realize right from wrong, because trust me I have made mistakes in my life and still learn. Anyways please be careful going on reservation lands! I don't ever go outside alone when I go home to my grandma on the Navajo reservation because of stories of heard. All of that is real and those demons should not be messed with. So please be careful ok. And respect the chiefs and the natives that once lived there shane.
Please can you do you old conspiracy theory videos
The annoying orange returns as well as shane dawson. felt personal lmao
Can’t wait for the next video !!!!
Loved
I hate that I need to wait until the 3rd video for them to actually go there, like dude, cut to the point.
We've missed you Shane 🥺🥺🥺🥺
“Like ghosts, demons, me” Ryland 😂
HES BACK FINALLY
Marry me mayonase
🖤
27:20 Yes. It is. Shane you know what you are doing is wrong,  profiting off a native American deaths and making it out too be spooky and scary. Like you said, You are a white man who is getting money from this video about innocent people that were killed, and making it out to be something scary that their ghosts are supposedly here.
You are back doing what you love I like watching your videos especially when you go to the haunted places I believe and paranoia a 100%
Nah sorry, too scary 4 me.
Rylands grandma looks fabulous!
Shane you don’t need to make everything scary you live in colarado 😭
After everything that came out and now hes back 🤔 to watch or not to watch ?
shane came back out of no where and he is already trending
Yaaay, 10:15PM, it's Shane time!
Ryans dad is the best!
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
Oh how I missed this. Thank u Shane 🙏🙏🙏
Side side side note... Trust me on this one you have a spirit that likes the song the taruntella.... Play that near you x
im literally so happy that Shane is back on YouTube because I am so excited for this series!
Living for this entire family ❤️ They are Amazing 💕 Hahah Rylands Dad talking about the horrible new TikTok trend 😂 So happy Shane is back 🎉 Loving everything about this 🌟
Anyone else miss the videos of him sitting in front of the camera and  putting tacos on pizza? 🍕 Or trying prison food? Just me? 😔
It’s the back to back trending for meeeeee. ✨
I've missed you so much Shane so greatful you're back
I promise to watch it properly tomorrow when I have more time....so good to see you back shane and honestly you are looking healthy and good. Blessings to all of your friends and family; even if you don't know it you kept a lot of us going through lockdown binge watching everything lol..... On a side note I have some ghost stories for you! My dad was an organist at a local church and we had many pictures taken of an evil entity around my head that a spiritualist told us to get rid of...seriously... And after that I can see and feel spirits.. I know people don't believe it but I have the photos. I believe things follow you x
I'll be there
Didn't want this
oh shane… come to savannah, ga. this type of stuff is normal around here
a buried dead man could be pulled out looking exactly like a zombie.  But needless to say I'm actually shook that we're almost getting closer to Halloween night.  however it has nothing to do with The Walking Dead.  As if.
Omfg where da fuck have you been??!!!
IM AM SO GLAD THAT SHANE IS BACK🤩🌟 I love you video Shane don’t let the haters get to you 🖤
Morgan is so incredibly gorgeous oh my goodness
Thank god for everything God is king and is coming back get right right him before it’s too late Jesus died for us and came back 3 days later so spread his word they are coming back sooner then you no
dont like shane at all but will still watch his videos because they are that good
Here to make a point to the Shane Dawson fans. I’m sure you know everything that he’s done, and I’m sure that your justification for still loving him is the fact that he has apologized. But is he really sorry? This whole video seems just a little bit iffy against Native Americans. Not only that, but he has a scandal like this about every few years, apologizes for it, and then everyone forgets about everything and continues watching him. If he was really sorry, than these things would stop happening. My next point is that he isn’t sorry if he’s acting like he’s a victim of cancel culture, rather than him being the reason that it happened in the first place. In the whole first video, he acted like he was the victim. Lastly, if you’re going to tell me to not watch if I don’t like his videos, I’m going to tell you that the reason is that I just wanted to make this point to everybody since he has underage fans.
Shit Alief is where I live
Honestly those drum beats sound like a firing range very very far away, Fort Carson isnt too far and they do night firing often
Ahhh I missed Shane and his over dramatics
Shane is so good at editing!! It’s wonderful to have him back doing what he lives!
What a loser
The whites have forgiven Shane 😍
morgan looks so good
Hitting devious licks 😭
lmfao who’s deleting all the hate comments
Episode 2 and literally nothing has happened, worst comeback ever 😅
bro can yall stop with the annoying tense music going on for 5 minutes straight it doesn't make the video scarier it just gives me headache :/
When the screen goes black and I see my reflection 👁👄👁
Bro this is actually amazing I missed Shane so much
omg cancelled
Shane and crew aka ghost busters 👻 👊
I'm so glad you're back to posting. I love the horror videos 😍
we got Shane and his crew back :)))))
This is a great series Shane.  Please dont make us wait another year, before you post another series? Please??? Love you  and so glad your back!
I need part 3 now…..
I have enjoyed this so much. I recently binged some of Shane's conspiracy videos and was wishing he would go back to his old content...and here we are. ❤️❤️❤️
I really enjoy the new content, good work!
I'm from Madeira, Portugal. The biggest park in our capital, Funchal, was a cemetery for many years!
Shane, I don't want to hate.I never write negative comments.But right now I just feel like you need some constructive criticism. Your conspiracy videos were so entertaining and real. But these series.They just seem too naive, childish and WAYY OVER EXAGGERATED! I believe that your viewers are smart people and not naive,so they deserve some spooks of higher quality. 😊
Shane look funny, why do you look like that? Have a shower
i am so happy you are posting videos again shane!!  can’t wait to see what comes next! ❤️🙈👻😁
Rylands dad is a mood 🤣
I wanna he friends with Rylands dad 🤣
I’m a sucker for this shit😭😭I love it
i litterly missed you omfg
U don’t know how much i needed this, thank you
OMARGOsH ahhh lol was not expecting that lol
I have severe depression & seeing Shane back made me even worse off. Feels like total shit! 💕
DUDE its OMAR!! thats awesome.
I missed you Shane 😭♥️
Feeling better when watching Shane. Feels like a hug. ❤️
Just started watching the video.. min 8:59 - 9:00 you can see a shadow pass on the sun thats reflecting on one of the chairs. (i hope I explained it correctly)
Love you're doing spooky!
I can't explain it but I feel a certain happiness that I haven't felt in a while while watching Shane's videos and I'm so glad he back ❤️❤️
Collective hysteria: this video has it in spades.
i said please say he posted again and YAY he posted again!!!
Rylands mom gives me monsters university mom vibes
GRANDMA WOULDNT HEAR THEM COMING
Why can't Youtube take control of these cringe sex bot comment thingies.
No one else annoyed how many clips he added and interrupted so many parts
33:11 I love grandma so much 😭😭
Does anyone know where their old cameraman went ?
I’ve lived in CO my whole life and never knew about cheesman park
That volts urinal joke was funny
I just love Rylan Dad! -- and seriously Colorado is haunted as f*ck every little town has its ghosts, some areas more than others (Chesman Park is really creepy at night) and holy crap third bridge.. all the nope
in my opinion you should never want to encounter a ghost and such. once u let them in they never stop.
Mom hurry get in here! it’s the dude who asked kids to twerk hes back!
California is toxic 😂
I have a new track on the canoe, please, please, and I'll write a hit for you! https://youtu.be/E-YsQaNlsNo
no
Proof 2022 will be a fantastic year. Shane is back!
I know Shane ain’t worried about his bad karma all of a sudden 🙄
YESSS THEIR FINALLY BACK I CANT DESCRIBE HOW HAPPY I AM
Please let the finale be multiple hours in length, lord. Amen
You have no idea how fucking happy I am to see a new video of yours on my reccomended again. Please don't stoppp
Yesss!!! Finally shane!!! 😲😳😀😀 im glad they are back!!! And here in my homwtown!!! Yaaasss im living for this!!!
Morgan is one of the most beautiful human beings I’ve ever laid eyes on
The third bridge area literally looks like the place where they shot Friday the 13th.
22:38 song?
I live for Rylands dad and the urinal comment 😂
Cámara man needs to shhhhh a lil bit
Hi nonce
God Morgan is so pretty. I missed her.
Ohh i missed this, especially the part when they discussed the things in the basement
I’m watching this in my car in my work parking lot and after a while I realize I’m hearing drums outside. But I’m across the street from a school and it’s band practice but I’ve never been more scared 😂
So happy your back !
I am personally so happy Shane came back. And I love the spooky content, he's always been good at covering these kind of things. I know he's 'controversial' but he got canceled over a person he used to be, it wasn't exactly fair because he was a different person then he was back then. He took a break to atone for his past actions, and  now he's back.  Now we just need Jenna Marbles to come back, we miss you girl <3
Yes Shane is problematic and kinda apologized, but I missed his content so much.
hi the camerawork hurts my eyes. pay this Chris guy wayyyyyy more cuz this is bs
Can we just acknowledge how much of an glow up Morgan had🥰👏🏻🌹✨
My depression gotten really bad but ever since Shane has started on posting my depression has made me feel a little bit better he's just making me feel better
Can you believe this guy used to make food with colours 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I did know the annoying orange was back, i’m watching his video right now
😂 - Bruce “ The little shit” jajaja how is Shane not going to love Rylands family ❤️ specially grandma ❤️
Totally agree with ya Bruce... on everything 😂
warm blankets, hot drink, snacks and this is such a comfortable nostalgic feeling! so happy you’re back
https://youtu.be/pmvtliYEhdY
I am so glad Shane is back, I love all his scary vids
absolutely no hate but... grandma's commentary is carrying this episode :D
Fcking tiktokers
That laugh tho lol i die everytime the guy filming 😅 laughs
I'm here for Shane posting spooky content!
I missed your Videos Shane👍🏽❤️
In Britain, most of the city parks are built on top of victims of the bubonic plague just like Cheesman. They had mass graves made, so removal would have been too difficult, and they wanted to utilize the space so they put parks on them! It was a public health debate when they were first discussing it
I love that ya’ll are still defending him. Very very interesting. These videos also seem like they have zero thought behind them and they are very scattered. Hm.
I truly hope that you aren’t being hard on yourself due to the amount of views based on your past. There are still over a million people that are interested in you. You were a huge part of my life and still are I proudly wear your merch please don’t stop you are so loved ❤️
The school thing is so funny. So they were destroying every thing and taking stuff but now the trend is to make the bathrooms better. Like there adding a bunch of stuff them.
I like that Shane gets cancelled then on his big come back uses an indigenous massacre for views. "I'm not that person anymore" LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I have heard the “oh those are just house settling noises” too many times in my life
go back to being silent
i love this whole family, everyone is so happy to be together and you can see how much shane’s mental health has improved, i love seeing him so happy and surrounded by people who love him!
Ryland’s Dad is my fave… be more Bruce!!
i’m late but atleast i’m here
why is no one talking about chris??? I LOVE YOU.!
not me trying so hard to hear the drums playing through the screen. am i deaf or am i deaf
We love youuu
So y’all’s school aren’t stealing toilets….. interesting
the fact that this just made my entire week
omg, i could hear the fucking drums wtf, i have chills
This looks and sounds like shit lol
Morgan is literally so beautiful it’s crazy!
i missed this sm 😩
You don’t know how much i needed this! I love you Shane thanks for coming back 😫😫❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just love Ryland’s family
ugh im so happy shane is back
Rylands dad needs to be protected at all times did all see him cradling the dog 🥺
I’m so glad your back you helped me get out of a dark place in my life and I was rlly sad when you left
Literally I see a shadow that has a black coat and a hat and it followed us now it’s just looking at everyone at our house now my mom sees it and believes us
The zooming noise from the camera man is beyond aggravating love Shane but can we make that stop? 😊
we for sure need Spooky october🎃👻 with shane🙌🏻
Why did I watch this home alone ? … WHY DID I WATCH THIS HOME ALONE
I don’t know if i should cry or scream im that excited
Sad
No way are you literally going to place that is heavily famous by where I grew up 😂
Now I need Jenna Marbles to return.
31:50 most iconic part of the entire video
For someone that's so insecure about himself, you do put always your face very much zoomed in on all thumbnails and channel banners/profile pictures...
Shane is baaaaaaaackk yayyy😻❤❤❤
“Her haunted room?!!” IM DEAADDDD
when are u gonna post again??
grandma is always sitting in that spot looking good as always... queen
So good to see Shane again and not having to watch Untalented ryland channel to see creative  Shane
Queen Shane & Queen Kendal Rae have GOT to collab!
Videos of Rylands dad only from now on
20:40 I'm sorry, what? That's a weird thing to admit to Ryland. ''We would take them there because there was no service...'' Ew
Where you been atttttttt
when is pt3 tho??
Who else wished this was just a 3 hour long video?
Glad ur back
I love Shane idc idc
PLS DO MIRE CONSPIRACY THEORIES
TRENDING MY GUY! ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEBACKS OF ALL TIME! SHANE WAS TRULY MISSED, THE VIEWS DONT LIE!
My Last Stopped Will be San Diego or Home.
The dude in the shed talking about the ghosts is fuckin brilliant
I love rylands dad🤣
shane trying to redeem himself but instead further proving that him and his friends are horrible fucking people
This actually a common practice in England.
Sighs. They say there’s a cancel culture but I see all the creeps out here free and loved. It be like that I guess.
Morgan please start doing true crime stuff pleasssseee
You are back!!!!!!! 💗
Can we just take a min to see how beautiful morgan is😌
You put omar on here!!!! Yay! Omar is such a good human. That makes me happy. It's nice too see you're face again Shane. Miss you.
Finally Shane you are coming back 💗💗💗
🐖❤️
Oh please … What is all the fuss with Cheeseman Park … all that for about 2000 bodies? Have you heard about the Catacombs in Paris? There are about 6 million people under the city. The underground walls are made of bones… no one is freaking out about it.
GET BACK WITH JEFFREE. THIS HAUNTING SHIT IS BORING AND LAME AS FUCK.
This is so funny to me as someone from Denver. Cheesman park was constructed on top of a cemetery. It’s really beautiful and peaceful, we used to smoke weed there every day in high school and it’s where everyone takes their prom pictures
What’s is funny Chris??
Simple: the bathrooms that the kids destroy don't fix it. They clearly don't want nice working bathrooms, so they don't need to have them.
You should totally collaborate with Kendall Raeeeeee omg pllease
who is doing the editing?
Yay!!! I’m so happy Shane is back!!
Bruce: “I think California is just very toxic” Me from California: 👁 👄 👁
Rylands dad is so adorable lol
This is embarrassing
Third bridge is scary. I’ve been there. That place is no joke.
Please don’t stop uploading we live one life what you did is in the past we live and we learn be safe I’m so glad your back <33

Rylands dad is awesome. 😂
morgan is looking fire 🔥 go giiirl
You should try going to the Riverdale Road I heard it’s haunted
Rest in peace to all the Native Americans who lost their lives during the Sand Creek Massacre. So devastating to learn about that, however thank you for shedding a light on it!
8:10 Morgan looks so gorgeous!!!
Welcome back
13:04 that’s where Jenny 69 from
IM SO HAPPY YOURE BACK I LOVE YOU
Aspiration 😂😂 I think that’s the wrong word
I’ve missed you 🥺❤️
bwahahahahahahaha 🐈
Instead of a 3 part series just make an hour long movie and cut the fluff out.
Hi
gooood i love u
this was boring
what's the girl's channel who is shown at 17:54 ??? it's not on the featured creators list :c
Thank you so much shane for coming back. Ive been in really deep depression, barely caring for my animals, i needed this. You always helped me. Currently home from school because im really sick. this helps me, ty.
Morgan did such a great job with that story for real. Thank you for including all that.
I feel like I just watched a 35 min preview again
I thought it was kind of weird how rylands dad was talking about the tik tok stuff.
Ryland dad is what all of us aspire to be
Ryland’s dad is the unexpected star of this ep
Love having the genocide of my ancestors mocked and used for “spooky” content. Fuck you Shane
Rylands dad seems so sweet
PLEASE COLLAB WITH TFIL /OVERNIGHT🙏🏼❤️🌹
Shane is the best doing videos, I just want to see the next video so bad 😩.
You’re back!  🥺
I’m also glad your uploading Shane!!🖤 Keep the spooky vids coming
Is this before Morgan moved into her house?
Finallyyyyyyyyyyy I missed youuuuuuu so much
SHANE… please don’t stop posting again. I love watching your videos no matter what it is!!
Bro ryland andMorgan’s mom could have a whole convo with a real life demon and then at the end be like “well they were nice”
Not the hit a lick challenge
How could they build a park over a mass burial site.... How utterly disgusting
Thank you Shane I'm happy you're back, please don't leave again. You really need to stay ❤
Welxome back love
Off topic MORGAN PLEASE KILL ME YOURE FUCKING GORGEOUS BABE
Get off the internet
Loving this series can’t wait for part 3 ❤️
i have to say that Rylands Dad gives me Trump supporter vibes
My god is back 😁😁
Rylands dad doesn't get enough hipe with his humor lol
90% of this is other youtube channels clips...
can we just stop and appreciate how Morgan is just always glowing ✨
https://youtu.be/awkkyBH2zEo
this video gives me: white people trying to milk something out of nothing!!! truly nothing has changed with Shane!!!
I hate tiktokers! They make me being shame to be human.
My life makes more sense now, that you are back shane! <3 ive missed you! you have help me so much with my mental health!! So has Ryland! So thank you! <3333 Love you!
this shit bussin no kizzy no cap yo , my gee
my god the editing is really bad
I feel so much more complete now that Shane is back. It’s the same feeling as coming home to your parents after being away from home for a long time ❤️❤️
Lmao the devious lick trend
the comments on this video 🤢🤢🤢
For real so happy your back!!
Shane…I have goosebumps all over my body. I have seen the “hat man” shadow figure several times in my childhood described at 16:40. I’m honestly terrified to keep watching because I’m so affected
you’re trying to make one of the most popular and walkable parks in Denver spooky… nothing is spookier than your comeback to this platform 🤢
Not good
Finally we have Shane back! Now we need Jenna Marbles and life will be complete.
Say what you want, but his editing is great. He literally makes everything out of nothing, lol.
first video from you i’ve watched in over a year!! so excited!!
Ryland’s family is so funny 😂. Loved Grandma. Can’t wait for the finale ❤️👻
Idk man i went there and played the ouija board and nothing
morgan is GLOWING
So glad to see Shane back!
Missed you so so unbelievably much Shane 🥺🥰
Are you excited for the new scream movie in January?
Cannot wait to watch this after work!!!!
Can we see the scary now?
My favorite part is when they realize what they are doing might be disrespectful and then just laugh about it.
Omg Morgan shouting out Kendall Rae 😍 love her!
YAYYYY I NEED U SO BAD RN
Thank you for the spookie wookies.
"did you guys know the annoying orange is back" - hahah no I did not but THANK YOU! Made my day
Dear Shane. Please bring Jenna marbles back too we missed u guys so much
“Creepy spookies” 💀
5:33 what was that woman doing there?😂😂 she weren't even on her phone or nothing.
the editing is annoying
I missed these videos! ❤️ Shane!  The calm guy talking about it while fixing a random object 😂 such a dad moment
I LOVE MORGANS MIDDLE PART
*HALLOWEEN VIDEOS I BETTER SEE THEM SHANE*
You all should check out Waverly Hills Sanatarium. It is hunted. It use to be a TB hospital. It’s super creepy up there and a lot of people died there.
Um that girl talking about Cheesman park us hella disrespectful. Especially when she said most of the bodies that remain there are bad people. Which is not entirely true. Yes there are many criminals but there are probably more women and children who were poor or those considered to be mentally ill and unable to afford a place to live and had no family. So noone could afford to move their bodies.
Literally nothing happened
Chris’s camera work is quite shaky. I think for the next series maybe they should work on that or maybe look into stabilizing equipment.
Let’s go Kendall Rae !
Shane and OmarGoshTv in the same video!! 🤯🤯
“I feel like Kendall Rae” 🤣
About Cheesman Park: That's so sad that a bunch of the bodies were cut up and spread around elsewhere :( and why werent the bodies in caskets to begin with?
Now, let's hope he goes back to these cool haunting and conspiracy videos and STAYS with them instead of doing anything that has to do with the toxic ass beauty community.
Morgan is so ✨beautiful✨
Impeccable Shane. Truly 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Please someone tell me why there’s so many porn bots copying commentssss it’s creepy and annoying
O M G!!!!!! I'm going to watch this later!!! Shane I missed you and I am super excited for your content!!
Someone in my school stole a toilet
yes i’m so happy you mentioned kendall rae i love her
Dude licking the battery stole the show.
Then knowing Kendal Rae though 😍😍
The Morgan - Kendall moment was everything 🤣🤣🙌🏼 I’m loving this series 👻🖤
this video is so boring lawddd. like there’s a lot of some random ass parts that make me think 'wtf is going on'. and the majority of this video just consists of other peoples footage, barley of his own. the editing is bad too. n the same stuff gets said over and over again. like we get it, go the the damn bridge already 😭😭
Glad to have you back shane!!! ❤❤❤😭
shane won
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
Paranormal Activity 7: Shane and Ryland
Yay Shane I’m glad to watch another video I missed you so so much ❤️ Morgan is such a babe so gorgeous
Morgan is 🔥
Morgan looks HOT🤩
The first two “intro” videos could’ve been compiled into one video. Just sucks to finally see a video from Shane be released and have to wait yet again for the actual climax of the video. Seems a bit redundant to me... looking forward to the finale. I hope Shane is getting pumped to create more of this horror work genre.
A weird fact about the Governor's law that led to the Sand Creek Massacre. It was still in effect until Sept 2021 so you could still legally kill a Native American in Colorado. The governor finally ended that law this year.
I missed Shane and his content so much, I'm so glad to see everyone together and having a good time and sharing it with us.
Who knew Angelina Jolie knew so much about Cheesman Park
I've missed you...love it can't wait for part three.  You look handsome in your shirt Shane!
This is so tacky wtf LOL
Oh! so you’ve learned nothing on your “break” and are just going to pretend like everything is the same! cool!
I AM SO GLAD HE IS BACK I LOVE HIM I MISSED HIM SM
“The moved some of the bodies, some.” In my mind : “you moved the cemetery but you left the bodies didn’t ya? You son on of a bitch you left the bodies and you only moved the headstones! You only moved the headstones! WHY!”
God I've missed shane so much!! So glad he is making content again
Yassss
I love this family 😂❤️
OMG SO HAPPY TO SEE YOUR NAME IVE WAITED SO LONG🥳🥳
Glad Shane is back with this type of content. My sister, mother and I love watching you Shane!
Congratulations on being listed on trending again, Shane. I'm happy for your success. 🤗
Ryland’s dad giving all the content 🤟🏼
So this is it then? Shane can return after taking a long enough brake without any consequenzes? Makes me wonder what this brake was for. For him to "grow and learn" or for your collective attention span to get attaced to a new drama and forget about every deplorable shit he did. This is literally why we cannot have long term structural change and douche bags like him win the upper hand while people like Jenna leave the platform for good.
*Can you adopt me Shane?*😂
I love that Shane is doing videos. Rylands family is awesome. They are so down to earth. These videos are great but they do creep me out a bit. 🤓🙈😳
I hate how people say oh well we beat the natives get over it we beat you. Yes but whites gave the natives space and land but then they were like oh just kidding we like this land so they started massacring natives just because "oh the soil is good or oh they're too close. Let's unalive them in their sleep. Let's unalive the buffalo's so they can starve to death. Oh Let's just shoot em all up right now." With no good reason none. None. I don't think we realize how tragic all the killing of natives really was
Okay but this is trending #3 So happyyyyyy
i missed shane and his hairy pits
The mom telling the dad to calm down is me with my husband. Lol.
A lot of bota commenting 😂😂
I don't understand - if you actually believe this and think that entities follow you, and you're making the decision to go to these spaces filled with negative energies and entities - would you not go the extra mile of learning all you can about to protect yourself energetically? Why are you not wearing or carrying obsidian and black tourmaline? Why are you not grounding before you set out on these types of journeys and dispelling that energy before walking into your home? Why play with fire and choose not to wear gloves??
Sorry, I had to stop the video at 12:01 to say something. I live in a home that was built in 2018. We just found out that our neighborhood was built on an old cemetery. It explains alot but just a reminder that we all technically live on a grave site of some sort. Anyways, I love that Shane is back making videos 💗.
That spirit she was talking about is called the Hat Man. I have had multiple physical encounters with it believe it or not it is a real thing.
I JUST GOT THE NOTIFICATION FOR THIS AND THE AMOUNT OF EXCITEMENT!!!!!! MISSED YOU SHANE!!!
13:47 i honestly thought someone or something 😳 was snapping their fingers in my house 🤣 but i went back it was from the video lol 😂
Hey that’s us at 18:05 ! So awesome glad you’re creating spooky content again!
shane is so manipulative
I don’t understand why Shane and other people spend so much time hating and they didn’t realize they try to cancel multiple of part and they were the bad part of cancel culture. And other youtubers where innocently victimized.
I live near this bridge and actually have to drive it frequently. I used to go there when I would get in fights with my family or have panic attacks because it would always calm me down!
Despite of what people say about Shane and his past; as a First Nation myself, I’m more than thankful that Shane and the rest of the family had produced education on the topic of what happened at this location. People brush over native Americans and what happened to us during the colonization period, so the fact that they even mentioned the story warms my heart. Thank you Shane and team ❤️
I love how homey the Adams family’s house is♥️
Can we talk about how pretty Morgan looked 😍
No matter that ryland is gay and Shane is bisexual , you still have privilege in you. And that privilege is just toxic in general. It’s pretty disgusting that you never talked about or supported the black live matter movement.
I thought everyone hated this dude lol
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Rylands grandma is my fav 🙌🏼
God I fucking love you SHANE DAWSON
shane is back???!!!????!?
Since you’re so close to Kansas, come visit Theorosa’s Bridge!
How did I not know Morgan was Ryland’s sister😌
The fact that they make the into like terrifying and the video is just hilarious
I’m so happy your back Shane!! I have so much nostalgia watching these omg!!
I have to admit I was one of those ones giving Shane a lot of hate when shit hit the fan and his past videos resurfaced but I do think people can learn and change and it seems like Shane has. I did really miss his content. Being someone who literally grew up watching Shane, It does make me happy having new Shane videos. The internet was just a cringy place back in the day, a lot of people would be canceled if we dug up their past, famous people and just regular ordinary people like you and I. People can change and it seems like Shane has.
can you make the subtitles or the words on your video some other color than red, please. We can't read them. Thanks Shane. I'm glad to see you again. I've missed you too.
I love love love how everyone is participating in the videos. Family fun
I’ve never heard that I tik tok that the students from school ripping off or destroying the restroom. Who the hell has time for that.
Wow it sure is great as an Indigenous person to see a bunch of whities laughing about a very real massacre that happened and continues to happen to my people, all while misusing terms about my people, and making money off of our deaths 😃 That was sarcasm, in case you couldn’t tell. Shane, you fail upwards, and it makes me sick
Is Shane trying to reach a word count? I’m 20 minutes in and nothing has happened…
the fact they do these things with out armed security is mind blowing.
I’ve missed thiiiss
These docu series are not cutting it for me. He always have white people in his YouTube videos.
The thing is that Shane Dawson don’t even know how to make humor. He only makes humor for white people to understand.
Calm Down Completely & Hear God's Voice...
YEESS HES BAAAACK
PLEASE START A HORROR PODCAST
This has been so interesting and chilling to watch. My favorite kind of videos.
the content is bad, the editing is bad, the layout is bad. “this is so sad” yet exploits native american deaths for content. get a grip
Love
we have a park here in Oslo, norway,  that was a cemetery before as well, called  Sofienbergparken.. 👻😨 just a tad smaller though ;)
Shannnnnneee, i love you 🥰 😍 you can't ever stop making videos!
I continue to pray on your downfall daily
Who is that sweet little brown pup oh my gosh that face
Please please please don’t let this man come back into your lives. He’s terrible and you all know it. Don’t let him get his fame on again
JUST LIKE THE CELECRATION OF HOLLOWEEN. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT DEMONS, AND SATANISM. THESE ARE NOT HAUNTINGS OF PEOPLE WITH UNFINISHED BUSINESS. IT IS A MANIFESTATION OF DEMONS. HOLLWEEN THEY SACRIFICE PEOPLE. INCLUDING CHILDREN
OMG SHANE!!! YOU ADDED A CLIP OF ME AND MY FAMILY FROM OUR OWN VIDEO ON 3rd BRIDGE!!! I’m fangirlling so hard!!!! 🤯❤️❤️❤️  I’m a paranormal nerd and know so much places in Colorado! I live in Denver and I would absolutely LOVE to tell you more amazing places to visit!!
PLS THE FACT THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE DEVIOUS LICK TREND💀
Loved this so much!!! Such amazing editing 😍💖
Ryland's dad is my favourite. 😭🥰
How disrespectful and inhumane can you be to build a whole fucking park on top of the cemetery where thousands of bodies were buried. These people deserve respect even when they’re dead. This is a basic human right. It’s also disrespectful to the families of these people. Like, transfer ALL the bodies or don’t build a fucking park on top of them. God’s land is huge why did they specifically choose this piece of land? I don’t understand. I truly believe that the place is haunted and for a damn good reason.
The only complaint I have is this video isn't  long enough lol
I don't care what anyone says, I love that you are back Shane!!! I NEEDED this creative/raw content!!!
Ok ngl ive missed him
Your music is always to loud. Its really hard to hear what people are saying.
Shane we are glad you're back. Everyone makes mistakes. We missed you
Shane: is this disrespectful?  Yes it is very disrespectful to indigenous people to use there deaths to make money on YouTube and you know its wrong and post it anyways
Omg Bruce is the best 😅😅
I love you Shane but I do not claim any negative energy from watching this 😭❤️
🤮🤡 mih gnitroppus rof ssorg era lla’Y msicar dna ailihpodep eht tuoba tegrof tsuj uoy diD
I laughed my ass off when this guy licked the batteries and said "ugh it's dead, like the massacre victims". The guy wasn't funny, but the fact that Shane put that in there was funny. So glad he's back.
Omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
Indigenous people have been killed for decades by Europeans. It’s sad that people were not taught this in school. I’m from Canada and since the bodies of ~6000 indigenous children were found under churches from when their was residential schools, the cruelty has finally been exposed with solid evidence. Educate yourselves please. 🧡
shane.just leave
She doesn't believe demons but she believes in god......I'm confused
Omg Morgan looks great she looks happy, healthy, she’s glowing, I love Morgan
Okay Morgan just casually walking in looking like a goddess like it’s nothing
YAYYYY
As a Native American I am happy to see some recognition for other tribes history. Native American scary stories are actually super spooky 😂
I have missed you!!!!!!
morgan is so pretty mygad! love it 😍
Everyone really just forgot your a literal dirtbag huh 🤔
I love Ryland’s dad
Noooo... when do we get the scaries!!! /pouts
You have no idea how happy I am that you’re posting again 😭🥲
Listing about the Cheesman park ghosts in the trees.   And, Knowing who they are 🤣
6:44 that was ✨haunting✨
Morgan I am a large, British, male, assistant accountant who is your age currently getting my accounting qualification. That’s is all…
Thank-you for coming back!!
for my disappointment, this was so boring to watch. not for the topic or you guys, but because of the editting style, sure it's like your signature style and that's what we've seen from you before, the same dramatic editting, music, a lot of clips that makes it look a compilation of others people videos, which kinda feels nostalgic but I was hoping for something new, also because if you see ryland's videos, you're already used to this style— if that makes sense. glad you're back tho! i hope we can see a better version of your talent and skills
You should visit the Stanley hotel in Estes park! I think y’all would enjoy that!
SHANE I missed you!!!
"He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32 Jesus Christ died on the cross for us all my friends, he is our Lord and Savior, and there is no salvation without him. Please, confess him as your Lord and Savior now! Believe in his death and resurrection on the cross, and that he died for your sins. Jesus is returning soon, REPENT, and believe. God Bless you all
LOVE Bruce. My goodness
I've been wanting Shane to come back for so long and here he is. His videos make my day
morgan seems so much more confident in herself now and i love it
You guys should pray before and after these missions. Shane if you feel like things latch onto you, rebuke them in Jesus name and ask for his protection
SHANEEEE
Apparently he’s been getting rid of comments bringing up his cancellation.
Loveeee Kendall Rae
Shane I respect you. Cuz I feel like you got famous. And didn't want to. But you seen what fame did. And now your tryna protect people. Thx bro
20:44 Because of the implication.
I do not claim any negative energy from this video, and may all of you be safe in the name of the Lord. ✝️💕
Seriously fucked up that this "man" gets support.
I cry for my ancestors
half of this video is just clips from other videos
Wow I can't believe how toxic rylan's parents are. Morgan is an adult and deserves privacy. Just because you're giving her a place to stay that doesn't mean you get to walk all over her
When ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is badly made content... like.. all of it. He shoulda taken some writing classes on his time "growing"
Holy shit he's really back.  I'm expecting more conspiracy videos, sir.
All you care about is yourself.
You abuse people to get forward in life.
ADD comment of the day. Ryland's family has the cutest dogs! Good video too.
LOve you shane !!!!!!!!
Love itttt
Goddamnit!!! Im so fuckin happy to see this post and you again Shane!!! We missed your funny ass!!!!
leave
You don't do anything good for society.
I litterly feel like my life has changed thank you for coming back
Get off the internet. You just abuse people for power and influence and sadly aren't getting enough backlash for it.
glad your back shane !You are my kathy griffen 😊 your videos make my life better even when I think it's been falling apart . I wish I had a friend like you filled with so much positive energy . ❤
Love your spooky videos; more entertaining than most movies to be honest.
Wuuuu!! Ya quería tiempo para poder verlo!! Te amo shane!!! U r that bitch💅😊
Dad Adams spittin facts about these damn kids 😂
Can’t with how happy I am that ur back
Shoes
how is this 3 parts and nothing happened in this episode
If you rearrange the letters in “depression” you get “I pressed on.” Your current situation is not your destination. Keep going. Your breakthrough is almost here.
When the world needed him most, he came back.
when is part 3 comingg
Can't wait for the next video 😍 😁
https://youtube.com/shorts/p_XMjOzEzok?feature=share
Morgan had me scroll through all annoying orange Videos trying to find the time gap in the Upload dates only to realize that they have been uploading continuously during the past 12 years!!! What do you mean its "back"?
We went last week to cheesman park and we saw a shadow of a kid, it seemed like he was playing hide and seek with us! Hiding behind a tree and walking back and forward!!!
serious question because i am out if the loop, is garret not the cameraman anymore because shane and ryland moved or did something happen between them? i am living for the new shane content though!
Why are people forgiving this man?
I love how all of them are so supportive of Shane.
->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
i love you i love you ty for coming back
I missed Shane
Rylands dad was the star 😂😂 also Morgan looks stunning!! I like the topic shane chose it’s very interesting and I cannot wait for the final part!
so this vid was shit and there was no point watching it
Shane are you still alive lol I’ll know once you upload episode three
This is the content yall were missing?ok.
OOOOF ITS 9 AM RN BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO WATCH THIS AT NIGHT OMG IM SO EXCITED
yk i was honestly scared that shane was coming back and i didnt want him to but now i relize how happier i was when i watched his contebnt
I am so glad that Shane started filming his series again. He is so talented with his editing. I just love it. So entertaining!
WE LOVE YOU SHANEEEE!!!!
YAY YOU'RE BACK!!!!<333
I'm sorry Shane and Chris but you need a better camera man. It was so shaky and Chris kept laughing all the time.. Come onnnn
I’m so happy Shane is back 😭✨✨✨💕💕💕💕
This is basically just stories about how disrespectful people have been to the dead causing the dead ones to get pissed, and that’s understandable tbh
I’ve been waiting for your return for too long now I can finally be happy
I love  rylands dad like please my pee caught on fire like I’m dead
Stay of YouTube creep
Can we keep him canceled?
Shane im so glad u decided to come back and do horror videos , literally my fav part about ur channel
Love the vid but at 8:49 can we appreciate the dogs like look at them being such good bois. :)
Can we talk about how Vicky is so happy for  Chris to be there
Didn’t we cancel this guy
He never “took accountability” because he never actually addressed anything. If he did take accountability then he should’ve stayed of this platform
This sht is fake .  All of it .
SHOUT OUT TO 💫KENDALL RAY💫
rylands grandma saying “nooo i don’t think so” when they asked if she was coming ghost hunting was so precious and polite
I heard the drums 🥶
Ayo didn't you wear black face for 12 years?
This editing is almost impossible to watch its way too much background music and random clips from random people?? I m trying to give it a go but it’s so over done
cats
I feel like I never learned anything in school but when a youtube video starts speaking facts about the past like in the 1800-1900’s. I pick it up and understand/ learn right away
Tea spill watching trying to find something to hate on 👁👄👁
kinda missed you
THIS. IS. EVERYTHING!!!!!
See at this point you could care less about canceling people cuz they did something wrong, you guys just want an outlet to be mad at.. then you go back to loving them lmao some of y'all make no' sense
omg just stop go away
Plot twist: the ghost is a pigmented man   And he's having fun, clearly☠
Shane is really back
I got so excited when my notifications showed up saying you posted
I JUST got the notification for this and I acc just got wetter than a wednesday in the Uk hahahha ly shane & Rylandddd AND AH THIS WAS CONNECTED TO MY SPEAKER at first like lord helpppp meh
Ryland's dad talking about the urinals LMFAO "I don't know, I was in science class and my piss caught on fire" LMFAO
Why does this remind me of Regular Show!? XD
Wait- Oh! its another one!!!
So everyone has decided to forgive
LIVING for this! I’m scared, I’m laughing, I’m crying. Everyone looks gorgeous and I can’t even
okay but morgan looks SO PRETTY
I would pay good money to see early releases of Shane Projects all at once like a long movie or Documentary...don't know if there would be a secure way to do that without people leaking it but it'd be cool and I bet a lot of fans would pay. I bought the Conspiracy Pallet just to financially support Shane and then gave it away as a gift. It could also be an awful idea because I'm stoned
20:18 i thought i accidently click next video 😂
Years, Legroom, Hey Shaneee
I would LOVE to see Shane so some callabs with other YouTube Ghost Hunting Channels…. Or do a documentary on Ghost Hunting or something along those lines… 👻😱😱
Omg pleaseee hit up Kendall 🤣🤣
ryland's parent's are just the cutest
Bruce had me dying. He made this video possible for me to watch this while I’m alone. 🤣😂
To be honest watching shane spooky videos make me have goosebumps
I live in Cherokee Nation in eastern Oklahoma... Right along THE TRAIL OF TEARS...   Lemme say this.. My house.. Not super old.. Ive had to look into what i can because we hear a melody late at night but its an old song. Cant make out the tune but hear it... Boots walking through the house... Cupboards open willy-nilly, a mans voice loud and booming, but my husband wasnt home, shadows and orbs.   My house is 100% haunted and it feels like its from an era gone by many years ago.
Omg love this ❤❤❤❤ I love rylands dad
Can we just talk about how the first theory was about the devious licks.
FINALLY I WANTED THIS SHANE UR THE BEST YOUTIBR
I got chills at  18:16
6:42 - i miss Queen Shane so much :D Let her Majesty out Shane, please ! :D
Morgan 🤣🤣 I feel like Kendall Rae rn
I get a little motion sick from the way the videos are filmed lately, anyone else? It's just shaky and unstable and alot of back and forth and focusing, maybe I'm just not used to the new guys way of filming?
These videos are life
Shane is such a bad actor 🤣🤣 I love him tho. I'm glad he is back ♥️🙏
This episode wasn’t it ngl.. I’ll still keep watching tho
glad to see you back
When we were teenagers we def made out in trunks of SUVs lol just like Morgan said haha
This made me feel so wholesome. These videos are genuinely my happy place. It’s almost like Shane takes me to a different world and I forget about reality. Thank you so much, Shane. Thank you for being so open and courageous to step back into your platform. Your true fans missed you more than you know. It’s only up from here ❤️
so..... the whole world just.... forgot about everything.....?
I subscribed
I'm so glad Morgan brought up that the annoying orange is back 🤣🤣🤣
I CANT WAIT FOR THE FINAL!❤️
I’m living in denver like 💀 ☹️
Rylan’s grandma is so wholesome I love her 😍
Don’t end this ohhhh my god😭 we have waited so long for you to come back! Please make this a series!! We neeeeeeeeed more
Ugh!!! I’m already ready for the next episode 😳😳😳   I love you Shane!
Morgan is so beautiful!  Every time I see her she looks prettier and prettier.  So nice to see them all hanging out as a family so often, now.  Excited for the next video, too.  This series looks like it's going to be a ride!
I can easily see Shane making more scary films like this.  The music. The imagery. It's creepy and gripping. He's got such talent for this.
“ is grandma gonna come? “  “she wouldn’t hear them coming”🤣🤣
Shane, seeing you back means so much to a lot of people (including me!). Seeing in you CO is so refreshing!  Please keep the videos coming!  You and your family are so loved! 💖
Thank you Morgan for mentioning my people (natives)… I think people forget that we are still here. I am a member of the Blackfeet tribe. Love you Shane and ryland and Morgan 💕
Shane: posts  Me: stops my entire college essay to watch in the middle of my library 🤡
I’m so happy you’re back Shane. I’ve been anticipating your return since you took your hiatus. Love you all! Thanks for coming back!
4:06 didn’t realize we had the same parents 😂 always telling me their latest grievance 🥴
Am i the only one who worries about teresa (shane’s mother) really hope she is well and safe ♥️
So glad your back Shane, glad you didn’t let the negatives get you down, lots of love and best wishes to you and your family, ❤️ from Australia xo  😘
surely the finale is like 2 hours because i cant get enough of this :(
MCGOVERN?! Ah damn it we're so cursed
I’m so glad your back 🥺
Reminds me of old Shane videos. I'm so happy you're back, so excited for the next part ❤
the devious licks trend is the dumbest thing i’ve ever seen
😂😂😂 hell yeah Bruce
I want a Collab with you guys and Exploring with Josh!!!!
Well this proves that there is no such thing as cancelling, they just take long vacations and come back to make more millions :D Good for you shane! I don't think anyone shoulkd be cancelled for stupid shit they says while they are teen or close to those ages.
Aight fine imma watch this one shanayeaye
Wtf? Why didn't my phone notify me of thissssss?????
Is anyone going to talk about how the review Morgan was reading said “aspiration” instead of “apparition” ? That bothered me lol
The man who you guys cover his face is Captain Silas Soule and he is a hero   Everyone should know about him 🥀💔
This was fascinating ❤️
y’all love to act like nothing happened 💀
Ryland saying that they would take girls out there because there was no phone service and the girls would be more likely to make out with them…like come on guys you’re just coming back from being canceled 😭 and now you’re trynna find slaughtered Native American ghosts 😭 like why wouldn’t you go for more agreeable content to avoid being cancelled into oblivion
I think it would be amazing if Shane donated some of the add revenue to a local native charity or community. I think that would be so kind 😊😊😊😊
the editing on this video has me LMAO
Shout out to the Wizard who fished out Shane’s bloated body from the water and reanimated him.   🧙‍♂️ ⚡️ 🧟
I'll watch this in the morning xD
Well, this felt like a filler episode.
THANK ME LATER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noG1cye_UAM
Chris the camera-man never dies😤😊😂😂
cute video
flopped
came BACK at a perfect time to cuddle in for spooky seasonnuhh
You think this is bad, wait until you hear about how all of America was built on top of murdered, Indigienous people.
I love that Shane is trending again xox it brings me joy !!!!!  My heart is happy xoxo
I LOVE RYLAND'S DAD. 💜 Tik tok thing yes. Squash those tik tokers, please. And yes California is indeed toxic. Elon Musk left for a REASON.
dude ion kno what to be thinking rn lmaooo
Morgan is fire asf 🥲
Bruce was the main character
Rylands dad is fuming over those TikTok videos LOL.
Its me. I'm *things* 0:27
Oh my God I'm SOO glad to see you!!🙌😄😜..I love love love the haunted series & videos you post!! I've been waiting for videos from you forever! FUCK AALL the haters And Everyone Else! I👏 FUCKING👏LOVE👏YOU👏. I totally understand if you had to take time for yourself, but please keep on posting & keep the videos coming cuz you make me laugh when I'm having a Fucked up day & you Make my day when I watch your videos! ❤️ ❤️. So proud of you though honestly. That's what it comes down to👍👍☺
Bruce and grandma are the funniest.
Rylands dad is bringing them all the laughs and energy. plus They all look very happy to see Shane and Ryland. And Morgan? gorgeous woman. <3
Missed you man
We still love you Shane!!!
Did she say aspiration
I’m only a few mins in and literally dying at Rylands dad 🤣🤣 “little shits” hahahaha
Morgan start doing true crime stories mustangs or whatever pls
I’ve missed these videos so much ❤️
The quality of this is awful. If shane wants to make horror movies, he really needs to step up his game.
Okay great video but the background music is a bit much. Especially when talking about the facts about the park.
It's so good to see ya'll happy in Colorado!!
Just have to say, I live in an area where this is also very common. Our entire city is a burial ground and if they find bodies, they just move them to the next hole. Like there’s so many, you would have to demolish the entire city to get them ALL out. My friend is currently working on a huge dig, she’s an archeologist, and they’re pulling bodies from beside a hospital. Our park is called Skeleton Park, for obvious reasons.
WEVE MISSSSEDD YOU
I LOVE their Dad he's so funny and genuine
Bruce continually bringing the topic back to tiktok "it's national!" And Vicki just "don't say that on camera!"  Feels just like being home 😂🙈
feelin a presence isnt always necessarily a bad thing but if it disturbes ur flight or fight response that tends to be leaning on the scale of something unmoral
What is what ?? ?
I’m so happy shane is back :D
can't WAIT for the 3rd video!! 😱😍
✨I love these haunted theories and conspiracy theories I always found them interesting and sometimes mind blowing lol I watch these a types of videos all the time Shane’s face is like wtf ✨😬😂🖤
I MISSED YOU TOO! Welcome back to YouTube! I love you so much Shane. It feels so right seeing you live a life of happiness and laughter.❤️
Spook-tober... welcome home Shane  🎃 🤪 ❤ 🧙‍♀️ 🪄 🧹 🧙‍♂️ ♎ ⚖
This kinda story is so needed tho. It’s lighthearted but I also had no idea about the Sandcreek Massacre. This was actually very informative
Shane. I never stop wishing you were back. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. Thank you. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
I can't wait for the next one.
How was I asleep when the notification came through 18 hours ago! Also, was gonna have a productive morning and now I'm snuggling back in bed to watch Shane, the fambam and the magic. ❤️
I would shut the bathrooms down and make them go in a porta potty🤦🏻‍♀️
His Dad is the most typical white American dad with his sayings, I swear 😂
My boy trending again! Glad to have you back Shane, like your best life for YOU ❤️
where is part 2?
Disgusting that he’s still making content. Even more disgusting that people still support him.
Can we literally talk about how much time and effort he puts into putting content out for us!!! 🥺❤️
i love you shane sm like omfg your my idle. like dont let anyone knock you down shane.
I'm so happy y'all put Omar in there! He is amazing
I’ve been waiting for one of your conspiracy theory videos for so long
Grandma is a savage
I’m a newbie witch and a spiritual person as of last December I went to the culinary institute of America in Hyde park New York. There is a graveyard there and a monastery that you can go to the front gates of it. I’ve seen things I can’t explain and other students have seen the same.
I think they all look so much happier after moving from CA.....  On another note interesting video! Can't wait for the hunt!
I LOVE YOU SHANE DAWSON
Croke already
Everyone: talks about spooky stuff Morgan: The annoying orange is back
Exactly!!! Like did Tiktok run out of dance moves ????
Can’t wait to see the next episode
dam I love you Shane but there's way too much build up and nothing happening... Super disappointing to have to way an other week for something to maybe happen...
YES SHANEEEEEEE
morgan u slay
OMMGGGGGG YOUR BACKKKK THANK GOD 😩😩😩😩😩😩😭😭😭😭😭😭
Let's not forget the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park and the Denver airport theories 😳
Hmm I thought YouTube demonetized Shane? But I got multiple ads
RYLAND 💀💀 “she wouldn’t hear them coming”
"She wouldn't hear them coming" Ryland....😭😭😭😭
Your awesome shane thank you for coming back stronger then ever ,#3 on trending great job 👏
I don’t mean to burst anyone’s bubble, but if you “hear children getting hurt”, either you’re within a couple miles of something that’s actually occurring irl OR you are a perpetrator who can only store or retrieve an audio recording in your brain of something that occurred. Ghosts don’t scream if you weren’t a witness to the event that happened irl.
Morgan looks so gorgeous in this vid
i love shane
Also, isn't funny how Shane has no PoC friends? 👀
Omg Kendall Rae hearted my comment yesterday on Twitter! That would be EVERYTHING if you guys did a video with Kendall and Josh (Her hubby) I'M HERE FOR IT!
I'm probably outing myself but I don't care... I have NEVER related to someone more than when Morgan said "Trunk" I literally screamed and am still dying of laughter! <3
Cant wait for the finale!
Living for the Kendall Rae shoutout. She's the best
Okay but Shane is the LAST person who should be calling out anyone for filming self incriminating things....
Love you Shane
I can’t explain how glad I am that you’re back Shane❤️ I love your videoes and I feel really sad that people are still hating on you, when I can clearly see that you’re just a genuine good person who has done some mistakes. I hope you will stay this time!❤️
I am so glad that Shane is back 🥰 I've been missing his videos and I can't wait to see him and Ryland get married 🥰
SHANE❤️❤️❤️
SHANE'S BACCCKKK YAYTTT! BITCH I MISSED U
I love Rylands’ dad 👏🏻
So glad to have you back! Never stopped loving and supporting you ❤️
The zoom in on the dogs is much appreciated Chris
Morgan is literally so gorgeous
DON'T EVER LEAVE AGAIN SHANE!! PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES..What is most important is you forgive yourself!!
I feel like that’s extremely disrespectful that Denver would move a cemetery :/ it doesn’t matter the reason, those restless souls are going to be mad they can’t find their bodies because they were moved
Ion care wat ppl say bout Shane, I will always care bout him ☺️
Morgan I think we have the same moms bc mine does the SAME EXACT thing when coming into my room🙄😂
enjoying the  new  content
1 million views!  Way to go Shane!
wow morgan is so beautiful
Used to live next door to a family for CO and her son was wanted for murder in CO he was 18 years old and ended up being killed by Marshall’s. Y’all really got some shit going on there.
These damn cliffhangers Shane😭😭  You all look so great and genuinely happy❤️❤️
demonic spirits are real trust me I had to deal with one at my dads apartment and most people don't believe in paranormal but it's important to know these evil spirits are real and I might mention you to one of the ghost adventures crew I think it would be cool for them to check it out. Stay safe don't let any sprits fellow you home . I actually take the paranormal seriously.
This editing was to over the place take it easy over here
I never feel uneasy watching Shane's videos but the Cheesman park cemetary part left me feeling weird.
Morgan looks fabulous! Gorgeous!
What's with all the ads? 🙄
I'm sorry did Ryland just admit to taking girls to this place to force them to make out or
Cool that you're back and all but what is the point of this video... Especially if the place you are talking about isn't the place you are going... It doesn't make sense. If you didn't have enough footage to make 3 parts then don't try and make it three parts.
So happy you’re posting again Shane!!!!
The kids are also posting their fake IDS 🤦‍♀️
A fun fact about 3rd bridge. I used to be in the process of getting hired for Arapahoe police department.. and on my ride alongs there was always teens out at what they thought was 3rd bridge. In reality it's not the real one. The county/police spread a false location to keep people from going to the real one
Morgan is so gorgeous omg I'm literally falling for her
I always found Morgan very attractive, but right now... The glow surrounding her, the happiness in her eyes. That is one stunning woman. Goddam
shane i have missed you sooooo much you came back at the most perfect time when everyone needs you.were all so proud of you coming back to you tube and facing your fears(and btw the video is amazing)
“Nationally”
Spooky seasonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!
I've missed you!❤❤❤it's great to have you back!
my lights flickered as I was watching this. then they turned off completely. that's never happened  now they're back on!
So fucking happy you are back Shane, we all love you boo
damn! Bruce is funny! 7:47
Lmaoooo out of everything Morgan is like who cares what follows Shane did u know the annoying orange is back lmaooo gotta love her but she just unlocked a whole memory for me lol I’m so happy Shane is back he makes my skin glow 😌
Not Morgan saying aspiration instead of apparition, I love it!😂😂😂😂
Shane! Im still so glad your back. Your missed welcome back so good see whole fam <3
I hope Ryland is doing okay.
Anyone know where that one road is that has a dip in it where a bus of school kids died? I remember hearing stories that the kids were at the bottom of the dip and when your at the top, you can turn your car off, put it in neutral and take your foot off the brakes. Your car would roll down the hill and when you get to the bottom of the dip some kind of energy will push your car all the way back up the dip and away from it. Scientist were trying to say it’s a magnetic field, while everyone else says it’s the kids pushing your car away from the danger where they died. I wish I could remember where it was located. Not that I would go. I try to avoid haunted places as I don’t want to take anything back home with me. 🥺
Vandalising is dumb but vandalising and videotaping it is even dumber.
Ryland's family is so sweet! Specially grandma. ♥️
You are one of my favorite humans Shane! Thanks for always being REAL! I admire you and your strength! Much love ❤ Ps Your my dream guest on my conspiracy channel I just started Totally Blunt With Cher  ✌👽🛸🌬🙏💙💚❤💜🦚🦄
Wait I would live and die for a Kendal Rae collab
Ryland's dad needs a channel 😆 🤣  Please!!
Hearing all this stuff about Third Bridge definitely takes me back to high school, lol.
Can't wait for the finale!!
I officially love Ryland"s dad!  He tells it like it is girl.
This was part 1 B. Wtf. Get on with the spookys.
Shane's matte black tumbler is giving me ✨redacted✨ flash backs. "Get into my coupé" - if you understand this: let's be friends
The comeback I never knew I needed.👏👏
Is it just me or is this completely boring to watch?? I miss the conspiracy theory videos!! Being super problematic and boring isn’t it…
33:10 lol
So happy you’re back.
so nostalgic and comforting
Bruce’s passion about the devious licks TikTok trend has me rolling
awww I want to read Grandma!
Morgan’s very naturally beautiful
My daughter knows of a guy who killed his wife and they lived in Colorado Springs just last year. A lot of nasty crazy horrible things happen in Colorado. You should try going to the movie theater where the murder happened inside the theater. My sister lives in aurora and they've experienced a lot there
Grandma made the video 😂
18:45 💀idk why its funny to me
so good -missed you so much!!!! keep gong
Next time, take me
It’s so wholesome, them all living so close and having their little family. Dad is right, California is toxic! The move was a very good decision, I’m happy for them.
Why the fuck do I need to watch 1 minute of commercial
im so glad ur back..... youtube has been boring as fuck
plz stay cancelled u monster
The only thing haunted about chessman is the squirrels
YouTube was getting boring without you guys
This was tough to watch, kinda boring sorry to say.
All of you are pathetic or just as sick as this "man" is. Seriously society has hit a new low but then again its the youtube community what should i expect.
Lol there is no way the comments are not filtered
YESS
At our school someone peed in the soap dispensers and destroyed our trophies and started 3 fires in 3 different bathrooms
It's true about the viral tiktok challenge. (Main reason I'm don't waste my time on that mindless app. It's making people stupid) I was on the train with these high school's / college kids in Aurora (Same location) they told me that the kids are trashing the schools because of this Tik-Tok challenge. I was sitting with girls. They stated that it was very stupid but it was very real. Then they had the "slap your teacher" challenge. The girls had explained to me that the teachers are not going to stop their curriculum to tell students what they shouldn't be doing already. Plus, it's also not the teacher's job to handle the schools. Their job is to teach. It's really sad. The girls said they thought it all was really stupid. And these were straight A students. The dad cracks me up lmfao 🤣
Sad to hear stories like this.... WE were treated like animals... And to this day... A lot of people still have no respect for us as NATIVES ... #NATIVEPRIDE🪶❤️
Oh my gosh I’m so glad that you’re back. Amazing amazing work. I hope that one day I get to meet you! You’re such an inspiration to people. Don’t ever stop being you. Let the haters hate but know that the people who really truly love and appreciate you and support you!
morgan is so pretty omg
We´ve missed you too, my love!
The lack of proper acknowledgment to country is pretty characteristic of Shane
Haunted theories with Shane Docile
Two seconds of Rylands dad and I can tell he's a Ken, votes republican, and watches Fox News... 😬
Bagi saya sangat sangat menyenangkan untuk ngumpul rame2,
I’ve missed Shane so fucking much!!
Honestly not a fan of ghost/haunting related content, it feels forced to me. Hope that Shane makes a variety of different videos in the future!
am  i the only one who doesnt care abt rylands family,  like at all.
Say what you want about your personal feelings about Shane but no one can say he isn't amazingly talented! YouTube has missed you sweetie. <3 Glad to have you back for Spooky Szn!
I love Omargosh!  Gimme kiss!!
Gosh. That TikTok trend where they destroy school bathrooms is outrageous. That's so stupid to do for views.
that was a cool history lesson, i’m looking forward to the next video. :) And i just have to say the black and white dog -Sooo cute!!! lol. It was really fun seeing the family again- love them. :) Thank you for another fun video. xo
i'd missed watching his docuseriess
DAD !  We need dad time.  Just 5 minutes a day of Rs papa preach !
Boo I need more !
Rylands dad needs to be in politics 🤣
Ugh i wish he uploaded every day cause i cant get enough of his amazing videos😩
If the native americans are the ones hunting the place… then that’s ok😒😒
I’m so happy to wake up with Shane again it literally made my day!!
The fact that this came out of literally no where makes it all the more better.
Has Shane been the annoying orange this whole time
You need to come check Riverdale Road In Thornton. It just made the news again, and it would be cool if you did a video on it and its history.
@26:48 what was that little animal running infront of the car? 😶 put the speed of the video at 0.5x
So glad you're back 😩
Shane!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
The grandma is SO FREAKIN CUTE
Omg I just love Rylands family 🤣 🤣 🤣
I love rylands dad 😂
I've missed Shane so much....   Shane needs to do a series with Exploring with Josh! Would be so amazing
Actually really good video I watched in full love the natural family vibes  good luck with everything 💜 Ps grandma as class
So glad ur back
Vicki and Bruce are LITERALLY my parents  Vicki: “you better stop, you’re annoying me” Bruce:👁👁 “we’re gonna find out real quick”
I need part 3 nowwww
OK BUT THIS SERIES ARE REMINDING ME OF MY FAVORITE SHOW SUPERNATURAL SO MUCH!!
I LOVE YOU OMFG IM SO GLAD UR BACK MY LIFE JUST GOT A LITTLE BETTER
my man back at it again . Letzz gooooo
Welcome back to YouTube Shane! I still have your pallet my bf got me lol
Your videos about creepy stuff always start  like first minutes of scary movie. So intense. Love it
"ugh it's dead, like the massacre victims- ANYWAY"
The nameton
Well that's disturbing and happy I am watching this in morning hours 🙃
Sounds like a railroad track. The drum sounded like with a train sounds like on a track
SHANE IS FINALLY COMING BACKKKKKKK
Ryland’s dad is right. LA is beyond toxic.
I love it!  I love scary stuff.    I understand what the governor did was horrible but I really wish we would stop with the stupid “white” guy and all the name calling.  Again I am not diminishing what the governor did it was very Horrible.  All of the stuff happened many many years ago and that is NOT who we are today.  I have so many friends of all colors and I work in the public and everyone is SOOO nice.  Let’s just get along but the media just won’t let it happen.  They have to keep us divided. 😤
The P3d0 is posting again!!!!!!
I’m sorry to be negative, mainly because I have such a deep respect for Shane, his family, and the community that surrounds him, but that “demonologist” is totally full of crap. She talks about how at first she thought Shane was lying but now she totally believes him and then goes on to give “facts” about the entity, like seriously? She’s only jumping on the bandwagon and trying to drag everyone she can manipulate along into believing her bull. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying Shane doesn’t have something following him, I believed it from the moment he told us when he lived in the old house where he used to film the Spooky Boys vids, but that lady is so full on her own ego. Again I apologize, I love your videos both old and new, but seeing someone like that worming her way into the community just sickens me.
Omg I started researching it as soon as shane mentioned it this sht is scary
#3 on Trending!!  I love that!!  SO happy for you!! :):)
That tik tok challenge is totally disrespectful and stupid.
Literally how is everyone being nice wtf
After this series ended,Shane should do a series called the life of famous Tiktokers
Why can’t people accept the fact that you can be a completely different person after a few years.  Watch the video and enjoy it or don’t bother coming to his channel to spread hate if you don’t like him.
Rylands dad needs to be in more videos he’s hilarious 😂
These spooky vibes are just what the doctor ordered👻👻👻
Ryland’s nana reminds me of my nana, except my nana is always dressed like she’s about to do some roadworks.😅 Bruce is a vibe I can get behind.  I watch way too much true crime and dark history, so I’ll probably avoid Colorado if I was to visit the US. As beautiful as it looks, I feel like I would be haunted or murdered.🤣 I’ll be haunting people because I just want to go home.
Trending baby!!!
I hate when the background music is louder then the audio of ppl speaking i have to hold my phone close to try and hear what ppl say. This ust gives off a foced vibe.
I needed Shane's videos right now!
🙏🙏🤗 https://youtube.com/channel/UC04nwNJLZq_894HGw1-S_Uw
so shane dawson’s content is taking other people’s videos and shopping it together with spooky music  with a few snippets of family jokes and him going oh my god
i wonder how many comments were filtered and deleted so more positive ones come up
Lol I don’t know if to be offended or to agree with Rylans dad. “California is toxic”.
I’ve missed your videos so much!
This could be an amazing ongoing series!
So glad Shane’s back, used to love his theory videos 🥰
ew.
CANT WAIT FOR PART 3
I really just wanted to say Morgan looks so pretty in this video. Also she has a good name 😉.
What a sick bastard that governor was Jesus Christ. I got like a gut wrenching sick feeling when that photo of that guy came up…
I love how ryland's dad is genuinely concerned about the tik tok trend thing  <3
I love California and I wish I could live there some day, but I agree with Bruce... it’s toxic af 😂
Literally reminds me of my family. And I just moved back to my hometown from Florida. Now I live in a town with a population of like 1,000 compared to 20,000 🤦🏻‍♀️😫. Small town problems. They always bring you back.
Everyone in the comments: "Literally"
People really say Shane is bad at editing, just because they don't like him. I think this video and his other edited videos are better than most on this site.
California is toxic! Especially SoCal, just the atmosphere here is awful. Planning on moving to Montana!
the music stopping at the guy talking about the bridge is pure comedy
8:50 puppy dog eyes AWWWW
So that clown dad is bringing more attention to those ticktok idiots
Na don't do my girl Morgan like that. House and apartments are way too expensive these days its hard to stay in one
The start of this was like we are getting American Vandal season 3 lol
This is not anything new. They did the same thing in Chicago with Lincoln park.  There are some signs around that tell you the history. I look at it as were all dancing together. The living and the dead. Haha.
geez
all the adams have such perfect teeth
Morgan. She’s just so beautiful 😍
the kids are revolting from the education system not completely for views. listen to us. we live on a floating rock why do we have to sit in a blank room for 7 hrs a day?
Can I just say Ryland’s dad is hilarious and Shane your face when he was researching Cheesman park lol that would be me also who is that beautiful girl in the beginning of the Cheesman park history bit? I wanna be friends with her lol 😅🖤
I don't really belive in ghosts, but I also belive to not "invite" scary stuff in my live. Like challenging the spirits to prove me wrong 🙃. But I have to say that I feel American places seem to have a lot more ghost stories that I heard of in Europe (of cause except from England... So does that meen mean spirits and ghosts prefer places where English is spoken? Or is believing in ghosts and being hunted a tradition that was brought by British people to America. Because I have the feeling we just don't have this in Germany. 🙄
The music is too loud.  I could barely watch it.  I had to turn the volume way down at times.
So happy to see positive response from everybody. So glad Shane is back!
Random question. Does anyone know what Rylands mum does for work!?
The first story reminds me of a local legend/it actually mightve been real idk. Basically theres this mansion in the town (i live on the outskirts of town) and down the road about 2 miles is a creek and a bridge that goes over the creek. I dont want to write a book here, but her family pretty much ostracized her and made her live in the guest house by herself and she was never allowed in the mansion and was treated awfully. So one day she walked down to the bridge and drowned herself in the stream, and now she haunts the main house where she never got to be. People live there now and they have like a "ghost tour" every year but ive never been on it and dont know much about it
IDC IDGAFFFFFF I LIKE I SUBSCRIBE I MISSED YOU SHANE
shane i’m so happy you’re back i missed you
Yayyyy Shane’s back 😁
20:58 is that Karen fillipelli, anne, rashinda jones? Lmao
Papa Bruce’s personality is coming out!!! Love it
As a fellow person who lives in Colorado I actually had 0 idea about the massacre and Third Bridge. When I think about scary places I think about Cottonwood park and other places like that. So to say the least I’m excited to see the next video!! I wanna learn more about the bridge and see what happens when they go! Keep up the great work Shane! It’s great to have you back!
Them: a woman walking around in a white gown  Those of us that watch supernatural: ah, so a woman in white, gotcha. Already know the basis of her story with no context
SHANE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have missed you so much!
Shane: "I hope I don't die "  Grandma: "Yeah "  I love Rylands grandma lmaoooo
Great video as always. I do need to rewatch it because I was half asleep when I watched it through the first time. Damn sleep aid.
It's the #3 on trending for me 💙💙💙💙
Yessss so excited to watch this 👀👀👀
Ryland's dad is such.....a dad. lmao
I never left you side shane. Love you forever
I’m so happy you’re back!!!!!
i needed these back
I hope I don’t die grandma yeah  LAMAOAOAOA
Omargosh!  LOVE his videos!  Been addicted to them since 2017.  So cool to see him in a Shane Dawson video even for a few small clips.  Gimme kiss 😘
This was like a 35 minute trailer.
Not sleeping today works out bc I have hw to do anyways
Anyone: says anything  Rylands Dad: We'll find out real quick who it is
I LOVE Ryland’s grandma
Shane. I missed you but thank you so much for showing me Morgan she is absolutely gorgeous I’m this video
That sounds like good fun. Make out in terror😂💕
Tbh a lot of this could’ve been chopped
Yeh his back any shape or form now I can watch all for me I watched Shane all the time in the past then I watched Rylands and his sister Morgan so all three now complete any way love you guys Nanny Star blue mountains Australia 🦘
Welcome back, Shane!
25:51 I can hear them, also... WOW!
Okay Rylands dad is SO fucking funny😭😭
morgan’s face @34:30, and you just hear Shane go 🌈“family”🌈🥺gives me life💞
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ugh I’m so happy you’re back!!!
I'm so glad Shane is back, it makes me so happy watching these videos. Morgan's story telling was awesome, It made me want to research more about the story.
I love Ryland's family, I can see it why shane moved there, so much positive energy. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 I like it very much
Mr Adams is so funny! He has a lot of British cut throat honesty 🤣🤣🤣 he’s just like my dad 😆 love him! More of his rants please!!  And then where he’s cuddling the dog saying LA is toxic then starts ranting ‘it’s National’ about the TikTok craze again 😆brilliant!
Ryland’s dad is a whole mood and I am here for it. We need more Bruce in videos!
I’m so glad your back! My wife and I waited so long for you to make more videos. I love how you can make them spooky and funny at the same time.
@omargoshtv you are in Shane's video!! 😳😃
we need more content with Ryland's dad😂😂😂
Morgan needs an accountant!!
I’m so happy that you guys are radiant and healthy! Welcome home, guys!
morgan had such a big glow up and looks so pretty, but the camera guy just needs to be quiet hes so obnoxious
OMG YESSSS😭
So happy to have Shane back and doing his spooky videos again! Please keep it up!
I'm so glad you are posting again, many of us missed you!! <3
HESSS BAAAAACKKKKKK WITCHESSSSSS
I love you shane! Youre doing great
This is such a bull-shit . They are building tension with clips and music while they are not doing anything . THIS IS REALLY A BAD COME BACK SERIES
Shane's back!!!
I MISS YOU GUYS
I love you Shane despite who you used to be you've grown so much and I'm 0proud to say you are a lot less offensive these days
Morgan is so pretty 💜💜💜
I really like this kind of content 👻👻
Okay no sleeping tonight!!!  Thanks Shane for an amazing series! Cannot wait for more! ❤❤❤
Lol?
im not super into spooky stuff, but this editing is *chefs kiss
This is ok … but the background music is so cringe
Why are Shane and Ryland reminding me of Mitch and Cam from Modern Family, But serious.
I may welcome him back but i will always remember why he was cancelled and his past.
Did shane forgot how to edit videos? How long do you think it is okay to keep "an eerie violin royalty free track" playing in the background while the entire and unnecessary history of a messed up contractor with choppy editing playing in the background? I feel mildly sick tbf
why y’all acting like this man isn’t a predator
Whoa Omar made an appearance on Shane's video ? I love Omar's channel!
I love Rylands dad 😂😂
So happy to have you back, and glad that you humanized the horrific things that happened to the Native Americans.  Not much is ever said about this type of history.  And it is history that needs to be remembered.  Thank you!  But I am looking forward to your little adventure.
HE IS BACK!!! Thank God!!!
"IVE MISSED YOU" My brain : "awwe I missed you to "
14:32 This is one the most retarded shit I've seen for a long time, also "IT SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN FLESH" well some plants actually smell like that naturally because they want to attract flies.
Omg ryland and morgans dad cracks me up.
BYE IM LITERALLY SO HAPPY I MISSED U SHANE
You know... why burry dead people in the first place? Burning is much cleaner...
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Ryland‘s grandma is soo cute 🥰
You better do a chessman park video!!!. Please make this a series!!
Papi is back 😩😩😩😩
Missed you Shane
Ryland's dad is hilarious lol!!
i litterally could never hate shane. I love him too much . He brings me so much joy when he’s not scaring the f out of me 😅
While hes stop making videos he just playing minecraft
I swear every Park in Tasmania where I live is built on an old Graveyard.They don't even bother trying to move it,just cover it up and chuck some swings and a slide on top...it's all good!👍😂
I'm so happy you are back Shane ♡
Hear me out, conspiracy video on Covid 19 ‼️
I am so FUCKING HAPPY you’re back 😭
Ryland's dad just made this video so much better XD Just by existing XD
I love that my names Morgan as well
Ryland’s family are all such pretty people. They got those good genes lol
As a Colorado native, I am SO stoked that Shane and Ryland live here now, and are exploring locations in Colorado for videos and vlogs. When Shane went to CO back in 2018 and Morgan told the story about her ghost Angie that she brought home from Lookout Mountain, I was like, I can see Lookout from my house!! It's just so cool seeing them in my state <3
My life is dead so much better with Shane in it he’s so funny and entertaining ❤️❤️
Third bridge is so freaky. We went all the time there’s a certain spot calls hella gate and we never made it that far
I”f you take that you’re done” okeeey☹️😂
Loving this. Happy to have shane back. I like the new camera guy, he does a great job. But his laughing is a bit too loud and sometimes unnecessary. I hope he grows more into his role.
Does anybody else watch all of Shane’s videos at least twice? We don’t get much content so have to make the most of it! 😂 Much love to Shane, Ryland, Morgan and family, all the way from the UK 🇬🇧
That lady who's a demonologist doesn't know what she's talking about. There are only demons or angels and anything creepy you deal with is just a demon. And by the way most priests can't really get rid of these you need to go to a Godly person who knows about demons.
devious licks
Omg I can’t believe there is only 3 episodes I need a weekly video of Shane just talking crap I would legit watch it religiously !!!   I’ve had covid and been really ill here in the uk and these videos honestly has kept me going.
why are sOme kids now so weird? omg. have some dignity and common sense.  anyway, Shane thank you for coming back. :)
Shane! Omg fucking yasssss!! I am so glad you're feeling healthy enough to create content and be back in the public eye! You don't know it but I love you so much! Back in 2019 when I was in my darkest days you got me through it! Your content was my only happy place and I will always appreciate that 🖤🖤🖤🖤 I absolutely adore your merch! Although I don't have much the three pieces I have I cherish especially the piggy backpack! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 Forever a fan! 🖤🖤🖤
Omg a Morgan & Kendall Rae collab would be soooo cool 🤣 I neeeeed it
Can we just say thank you for making videos shane and Morgan look amazing
i watched this 4 time 😍❤️
So glad Shane is backkkkk!!!
has everyone literally just forgotten? because how the f could you forgive
WE MISSED YOU, SHANE!!!!! ❤️
This is so funny and intense all at the same time 🤌🏼❤️
I am so happy that Shane is back. When YouTube send me a notification that he uploaded, I thought I am hallucinating 😂 Much love to you all ❤️❤️
Great storytelling Morgan!!
AHH so soon after the last video. Thank you, Shane!
Don't ever use the dolan twins or emma in ur vids i will haunt u for ever!!!! ☠
*licks battery aggressively*
NGL…I could do with only the finale. The two episodes so far are super underwhelming. Besides Morgan’s story, nothing was brought to the table. Just my opinion.
When we needed you you came thru QUEEN
Rylands Dad has jokes lol such a sweet family ❤️
I’m 14 mins in and this is terrifying! I love the creepy music and man have I missed your content Shane!
Morgan looks amazing
You should do a ghost hunting video with Mykie from Glam and gore 😊
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PHONE SERVICE STILL TRY YOUR EMERGENCY NUMBER (911, 000, honestly that's all I can remember)  The emergency number will allow your phone to connect to ANY service it can find. ALWAYS TRY TO CALL YOUR EMERGENCY NUMBER!!!!! Don't look at your bars and be like I can't. TRY!!!
18:43 like the massacre anyways
Okay I NEEDED these uploads. Thank you so much for coming back Shane. We missed you!
"I feel like kendall rae right now" ❤❤
Love love love ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘
Shane we needed this so happy ur back u do love us 😂 much love n respect from jersey
Shane only has one shirt 🤣
This man literally joked about pedophilia and not only that he has done some bad things yet everyone’s praising him like as if his Jesus…come on, after all that bs he did last year I don’t like him
I adore Ryland's family, reminds me of mine. Also this ghost hunting series is everything i needed. Please keep it up shane!
I've missed shane, I believe in growth and change you have grown so much since your first video and during that growth you found love ❤  don't listen to the haters continue all the great work your true fans know who you are and never stopped believing in you thank you for coming back we missed you too lots of love and hugs all the way from Ireland 🇮🇪 ❤
Please put a warning for motion sickness. Legit can't watch.
I’m so happy he’s back !!! Really needed this ✨
How To Make Opinion That Using Time Machine is Dangerous illogical 1. Invent time machine. 2. Travel to 22nd century. 3. Invent a machine that can change probability to make probability certain that opinion that using time machine is dangerous is Extremely illogical.
Shane think:  you, New Orleans, Afro-Cuban religion special, just think about it
SHUT UP EVRY ONE THIS IS GOOOD AF I LOVE IT
I’ve decided I don’t like Rylands dad
Shane* Anyway we’ll do that another time.   Video ends lol 😂 they all go home
gosh morgan is so beautiful
I missed this so much
im soo sorry but were is the whole squad  its just not complete.
Are you going to do this forever..????  I FUCKING LOVE THIS SHIT! ❤
Morgan iOS looking 🤤
So happy Shane is back but this bores me. He is so funny, hope he does more real life material.
I love Shane😀
Rylands gma is presh asf
No
Okay but Rylands parents house is BEAUTIFUL
Cannot express how much I've missed these videos!!! I just want MORE MORE MORE!!!!   Glad your back 🖤🖤
I’m so excited he’s doing this again 😭😢❤️
Not me praying that the last episode is atleast an hour long, we missed you
chris' tagline: "im sweating"
who let him outta the cage😭
LOVE the Kendall Rae reference 😂 you guys should link up!
the absolute BEST spooky season content!!
Thank you Shane, a million times thank you, your videos bring so much joy to my day 🥰💕
Wooo
WTF. They built a Park on a cemetery?!
Shane is a genius businessman. Creates a series on developing a makeup line… makeup line blows up and he makes millions of $$$. Shane creates a series about finding inspiration for producing scary movies. Therefore no doubt the movie will make him big $$$.   I don’t know how I feel about Shane. Does he make videos for just the fun of it or is it all a big marketing scheme to him?
Shane, you don't know how much I missed your videos.
Wow the kid that stole the fire alarm is truely sick. Hope theres not a fire. Ughh
I live in nyc, literally all our popular parks were burial grounds, Madison Square, Bryant Park, Washington Square, city hall park, and so many more
So he’s just gonna drop one of these without even properly apologizing?
I can easily see Shane making more scary films like this.  The music. The imagery. It's creepy and gripping. He's got such talent for this.
You re back!!!!!!
It's Showtime!
Yes! We need that collab with Kendall Rae!
I’m so happy I just had my baby couple days ago and my anxiety is kicking my ass so watching ur videos and other YouTubers made me relax and forget about anxiety
OmarGoshTV featured <3
No wonder weed is legal in Colorado that place is terrifying you need something to Cope
THIS IS A COMEBACK OF A LIFETIME SHANE! IM SO PROUD❤️
8:49 Dad's right, California is toxic asf.
Thank you Morgan for mentioning my people (natives)… I think people forget that we are still here. I am a member of the Blackfeet tribe. Love you Shane and ryland and Morgan 💕
When your daughter climbs out the bed and sneaks in the living room while you’re watching this. 😩 bout scared me shitless
You kick ass shane
Im here for rylands dad and the Boston terrier doggie!
18:37 dude licks a battery....wtf?
Rylins dad is too funny
Yay Shane's BACK!!
am I the only one who feels like it’s not that big of a deal to build a park over a cemetery if the bodies were unclaimed?? lol am I insane???
The demonologist cracks me up. Lol. She is so fake. A ghost from the 18th century.... bahaha.   Love seeing the Goth girls though!!!! 🖤🖤🖤
Your videos fill me with joy. Happy you’re back, Shane!!!
THIS, THIS IS WHAT WE NEED
Cjdjdjdjdj I'M EXCITED
He’s really peeved about those tik toking juvies!
Grandma Is The Main Character 😂❤️
Chris’ laugh 😂
Ok who are those 2 Adams dogs? Are they friends with Uno & Honey?
I missed you Shane you were my a favorite YouTuber I was so sad to see you go. But now I’m twice as happy to see that your back!!!
This was so informative. I like that aspect and believe that in itself shows respect for the RIP. Anxiously awaiting the next installment.
Not the fork in the pan 💀 thats real horror.
YES
It’s lovely to see you all so happy together, and Morgan you look stunning!! Being back home suits you. Can’t wait for part 3 !!
OMG YESSSSSSSSS I NEEDED THIS
LOVE y’all’s grandma! She’s so funny and cute❤️
All i can say is trolls being here talking crap will not persuade us supporters to not watch or to change our view about shane. Keep it pushing. If you ever gain weight i hope to god someone brings that to your attention in a spiteful way! Nobody is perfect. And some have a twisted sense of humor. Everyone attacks him as if a girl came out and said he SA or R her. Twisted humor is one thing but actually acting on stuff is another. I only seen one video that he didnt use good judgement on. Regardless he has amazing content and i respect that and his return to face people like the trolls instead of being forced into hiding instead of LIVING. ❤❤Shane keep posting cause you have sooo many who support you!
the bathroom destruction tik tok subplot had me crying
Was anyone else excited seeing Omar!?🤩
We love you Shane! Please stay!🤍
Welcome back Shane! It's truly wonderful to have you back :-)  It's even better to see you so happy and healthy. Many congrats on your gorgeous new home with the lovely Ryland in Colorado. Great move! ;-)  Thank you for all your previous videos, thank you for your present ones. You are a gifted film maker Mr Dawson <3   Much love from Melbourne (the leper state), Australia xxx
🥰
amazing we need this action back.
Yei, Shane is uploading! Don't ever go missing again!!
Yo, this new camera guy is trying way too hard to replace your old guy. Also, stop featuring Morgan, she’s so annoying I just waited for her to shut up.
Life is better since you came back 😍😍
Good soup shane. Great to get a second part! :)
Has everyone just forgot what happened? Like seriously..
Seeing new upload Shane notifications literally gives me goosebumps. With how crazy the world is it’s so comforting to know that this channel will always feel like home. ❤️
We love you Shane, we missed you, keep doing what you’re doing ❤️
I don't care what anyone says - I'm not gonna judge someone on their crappy actions 10 years ago - if were all doing life right then we should be a more evolved version than our past selves and Shane has done a LOT of evolving. Shane's apologised several times and has done a lot to distance himself from his past. I don't think if i ever met him we would be friends but I do enjoy his content. There are definitely a of Youtubers CURRENTLY producing harmful content and I would rather focus my energy on them then a guy who is "reformed" and doesn't even make harmful videos anymore. (also forever....#JENNACOMEBACKPLEASEWEMISSYOU)
Missed Shane’s content. Honestly since he left after the canceling I stopped watching YouTube 😂😭 nothing was the same
When I was watching the beginning, my brother was sitting in the same room as me, he said "What movie trailer are you watching?" Hopefully, I can watch an actual trailer of an actual 'Shane Dawson' horror movie one day in the near future and he'll ask me the same thing. Love you, Shane! 💞💞
Does anyone think this fell short, like the best part of this whole episode was Rylands dad's rants which where  💯
The damaging trend has hit mcdonalds too, kids will come into our work and rip the soap dispensers off the wall. For no reason?
The only horror in this film is colonialism
Wut happened to cheeto n dat one dog
He backkkkk
Anyone else  missing mumma Dawson
Everyone deserves another chance, we are all humans 💗 I’m really happy to see that Shane is back
i’m all about a comeback but your obsession with trying to make your life/experiences seem spooky is lowkey pathetic.
Is no one talking about the fact Morgan said "aspiration" instead of "apparition" 😂😂
I watched it last night and I honestly didn't want it to end 😢
The vandalism isnt even a trend LOLL his dads a karen
At lest we don’t have to watch 30 ads to get thru the video now 😂😂
Why are people so dumb like are people so brainwashed to jump on the bandwagon and damage property for literally no reason?! Like that costs money dumbass and is just overall so effing stupid. Grow a brain
The final Part better be Movie Length because I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Series!
Shane is handsom ngl
Wow, I wish I had a melt down that resulted in 2 $3mil houses with land!!😂
Yeah the school thing is happening and we are not alowed to go to the bathroom
Why is everything in the US so haunted?  If everywhere that someone died a violent death is haunted this entire country  (Germany) would cease to exist.  Either we got very used to ghosts ooooooor they're not a thing.
Ghosts are not dead people
Love it! ❤️ so glad you're back Shane!
Ok but is Shane going to dig into creepshow art I feel like if anyone can get a response it would be shane
Missu shane
I am so damn happy to see you uploading again! You can tell that you and ryland just seem a lot happier. Morgan you look beautiful as always! ♥️
Alright it's official, I'm moving to Colorado !!!
*in whining baby voice* "everyone changed their attitudes about him from last year you sick fucks" MISS ME WITH THAT. Some of us never cancelled him, but got shut down and just silently waited for his return. If you're mad, go away because NOBODY cares 👋
This feels like found footage where they all die in the end.......
Is it weird how attracted to Morgan I am?
Morgan and fam. You are mingling with demons by speaking as if they are a game. You need to plead the blood of Jesus Christ over your home yourself friends ands fam life
Your editing skills are amazing.
Morgan looks so gorgeous and seems happy
i forgot u were gonna post and now im honestly so happy. i look forward to living bc ur back
So we all just here rn watching this at 4:05 am
i gasped when i saw that he had posted a new vid
Talk about the flash backs w the movie poltergeist... It kinda makes sense to me tho ..... The placement the warnings... Shane u would make a kick ass movie ... I can't believe the talent and skill u have and eye for this .... Like my mind is blown
Poor grandma lol leave her at home
Turning 25 hit me hard as 24 was such a difficult year for me. This is my favourite birthday present to be honest
lol
Love the video but the music is sometimes a bit to much
I had the worst nightmares after watching this. God I missed you 😹💗💗
I have a grandmother that would totally go ghost hunting with me, I'd love to hang out with y'all and find some spirits
You sure you aren't gonna spread your cats chicken legs?
Im sooo relieved that shane is actually back and looking great too
Chessman park isn’t the only place that was built on a burial ground. My neighborhood and part of the city I live was also built on a burial ground, it my grandmothers house. When I wasn’t living here I always felt scared to come here. But now I don’t. I don’t feel like it’s haunted but I always feel like the is someone standing on the middle part of the stairs.
I'm so glad you're back. You don't deserve to be cancelled because of your past actions. I know I have said some crazy shieeet growing up that I would never say or joke about anymore so it would suck if everyone gave up on me after seeing a video of me saying something crazy like 10 years ago. <3
Morgan you look stunning, the hair the eye make up, all amazing
we need a whole series of rylands family😩 i love them
Can we take a moment and appreciate the editing
Morgan is like, so pretty, i cant even....she's is just So pretty!
The way rylands mom tries to protect Bruce from saying anything bad , she trying to protect him from a scandal😂
Im glad ryland grew his hair back.he looks way better, younger, with hair rather than a buzz cut
FUK YES HES BAK
i'm so glad you're back. shane videos are just a happy nostalgia kinda thing for me. brings me back to when life was a little less messed up.
omg hes back waited long enough
I’ve bloody missed you so much
Morgan looks fucking gorgeous
So glad your back Shane, glad you didn’t let the negatives get you down, lots of love and best wishes to you and your family, ❤️ from Australia xo  😘
I am literally scared to watch the finale!! This is giving me the chills!!
Plz make a YouTube channel where Bruce tells us daily news every morning😂😭
here before a mil views
i love this
Hey!! Can't wait to see what your guy's experience was at The 3rd Bridge that place is nuts!!! 👻
Shane love having u back and the family vlog are where it’s at omg I laughed u all are so funny
Love this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️pleaseeeee make more parts 🍀
Well, I know what park I will NOT. be going to.
Shane , Im just a big old fat man trying to show the spookies 😂😂😂
OMG MORGAN LOOKS SOOOO GOOOOOOD
I'm so excited about this series its been great so far!!! You can tell its exactly what you love to do Shane and it shows!!! ❤
listen shane I love you but the unnecessary intense music about the tiktok bathroom thieves was hilariously over the top LMAO (I know that was probably the point)
Aright, i know that Shane’s done shit on the internet, most YouTube’s do.. the fact he teamed up with JS is why y’all brought up his past otherwise no fucks giving. Tbh he’s better off with JS & he needs to focus on his family & do more ghost haunting videos! Enough said.
YEEEEEES SHANE IS BACK. WE NEEDED YOU AND WE MISSED YOU TOO.
Omar gosh!!! ❤️😂😂
Liked the Video before watching ✅ SHANE DAWSON made this so I know it's gonna be great 👍♥️
I haven’t been so amped about a YouTuber posting new videos since…….well since I used to get this amped two-ten years ago to watch Shane’s videos 😂   We’re so glad you’re back, Shane. Watching new your new content feels like a much needed reunion with that friend you’ve had in your life so long you think of them as family.
good to see him back 😍🙌 hope to see more content from him 🙌 morgan  is love 😍😍❤ i wish i could marry her 😍😛😛
As a native; I don’t know about other reservations but our people used drums for ceremonial purposes, like welcoming newborns, adopted kids, gatherings. Our people didn’t have a “war song”. Also I’d appreciate it if you’d talk about the residential schools, day schools, and MMIW (missing murdered indigenous women)
Shane, Morgan and Kendall should all totally do a collab together! A collab with Omgosh and maybe even Brittany Crabb would also be cool too if it could happen.
I LOVE ryland’s dad, he needs his own podcast 😂😂😂
The longest trailer for a movie ever and I’m living for it! Shane’s editing makes you beg for more!
A young girl screaming
ur backk!!
Got to my lowest point in my life and Shane came back when I needed his videos the most. 😭
The camera is so shaking
Everyone looks so amazing and refreshed. I’m just so happy for you all, Shane. 🥺🖤
Check out Missing 411 stuff Shane! That stuff is ridiculously strange!
morgan is literally gorgeous
You need to do a video with Kendall Rae!!
I have Said from the start, its lovley to have you back, its human to do wrong, hope you dont joke about Kids and melatonin color again, you know how it make you feel when someone say something about you, say your sorry when you do meen it. Ppl jus to love you, i love all human and no one is free from wrong doing. And do your thing now, you are in a place of love, you have money, you are doing great, i love your videos and hope this sesong change is your new beginning.💙💕💞
COMMENT
Perfect time for spooky season! 👻          -  All I know about Colorado is that it's beautiful  & that unfortunately during the past few years, I keep hearing about wives  & or kids  coming up missing &  or deceased due to a spouse or parent 😢
Omargoshtv!!!!
Why did I actually just learn about the sand creek massacre in history class like not even 5 days before this video was posted wtf
I'm just so happy Shane is back I can't get over it. Love watching Ryland's channel obvi but I missed Shane Shane.
Rylands dad is so real.
i'm happy you're doing this too Shane thank you so much
This should've been posted on Morgan's channel
WE WANT THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES BACK!!!!
POV: you can’t find the comments you were looking for 👀
God I’ve missed the shit outta you 😏🖤🖤
"Big ol' white man that wants to show the creepy spookies" Lol
Was not feeling this episode.  Meh.
I've missed you so much Shane! 😭🖤
Rylands dad is the star of this video 😂😂😂
I know one like isn't enough, but I'm so glad Shane came back! Any like is enough, I hope. Thank you for being so brave, Shane.
Ryland’s dad is based
Look up Seattle area haunted places!!! 13 steps to hell is REAL!!!
Well come back we missed you and missed your work 😊
why are you still here
Finally ur back Shane!! I hope ur doing better, I'd just like u to know I grew up on ur content and I missed u, you truly insipre me
I don't believe in supernatural things like ghosts and such myself, but I am always very entertained by your excellent film making skills. I think you are all great, kind hearted people, that I love to watch and laugh with - never at.
Ain't no one gonna make me feel bad for loving you, Shane. I'm an old school G from my teens to thirty I've been watching and I'll never stop if you never stop.
I literally almost just choked on my piece of gum…..I’m close to the end but when they were all just chit chatting about everything and Morgan asked “is grandma going to be coming?” And then Ryland was like “ummm well she’s not going to hear then coming”  lol 😂 it was just the way it was said , that got me laughing 😂
Shane needs to collaborate with tfil with their overnights 😂
SORRY I CANT NOT THE DEVIOUS LICK TIKTOKS LMAOAO
i absolutely love yal and im happy youre back shane! i cant wait to explore more fucked up shit with you and the squad 😄 press on and be yourselves! put your best foot forward and create, take that creative shit 🤣. i hope to meet you all one day & have some fun and good conversation 😍😄😇
Morgan is so pretty & smart & I love her!!!
2.39 did you hear a person say hello ?

Shane… Come to investigate in Bulgaria.  My town school was built over a turkish cemetery, while building it they found a couple of grave stones
love this series Shane! it’s genuinely scary for me! good job man! so glad you’re back! 🧡🧡
Much love and respect you guys! Am so happy that you didn’t let haters control your lives , life is too short to let others control you. I love what you are doing, there’s a lot of deaths in American that has been hidden as it puts so much shame. Thank you so much for being true to yourself and try not to be hard as we all have to walk through life and learn more about ourselves and others. Much love from Melbourne Victoria Australian 💜💜💜💜🌹🌹🌹🌹🕊🐶🦉😻🦄🦂🕸🕷🌈🇨🇱🇦🇺🙋🏻‍♀️
🤢😪
I love that Ryland’s dad is the one that has to update them on TikTok trends
Yay!!! Part 2!!!!!
the camera is so shaky im getting motionsick :(
Shane: "Things follow me, Chris." to Ryland: "Don't things follow me?" 20,1M subscribers: Hello there!
Ryland's dad is so funny lmao
I loveeeeeeeee you shane
YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO thats all  i gotta say
Kinda happy he’s back ngl
I'd been rewatching Shane's ghost hunting videos, wishing he would come back and give us more, then he comes back with this!! Thank you Shane, we missed you <3
Ok but is Chris seeing anybody?????
OMGOOODNESSSSSS, I CAN NOT SAY HOW HAPPY I AM THAT SHANE IS BACKKKKKK,  I AM GOING TO BE HAPPY ONCE AGAIN!!!!!!
A kiki is an lgbt get together where people hang out and gossip..  not really a date between two hetero people lol
Morgan is literally stunning here , glowing 💖
jesus i can’t with those kids in america
Lemme get settled with mah snacks
The creepy spookies 😂💗
I grew up in a small town in rural NSW Australia and our town pool was made on top of what was once a cemetery. When the town started to grow they decided to move the cemetery and they crushed up the tomb stones to make into paths. Another local place that we would go to growing up that was family orientated was a man made lake and when they created it they decided to leave the church and cemetery so whenever there is a drought the water levels drop and the church and tomb stones arise.
God..... I've missed this
20 Million Subscribers have it right. Good job
Love that Shane is back, the camera man's shaking is making me sick though. 😑
Morgan was so awesomeee and amazing at telling the storyyyy🥺🥺❤
Good for you!!! I’m glad you’re following you’re passion. You’re worth more than those naysayers.  I’ll have to watch this with the sound down and peeking behind one hand ☺️
IM SO HAPPY HE IS BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER SO HAPPY FOR HIM AND WISH HIM THE BEST HE DESERVES IT 😭💙
“ Licks battery” Dead like the massacre victims anyways”
Talk about corona conspiracy
Shaneee this is such a filler episodeeee
Love this Love Shane 💘I just got home from working at tacobell
Okay but Morgan looks SO GOOD omg
Of course im watching this right now at 5am. I love the fact anything I watch anymore in the recommended is Shane's videos again. It just makes me so happy. I love how involved bruce was in this video hes so precious. Really fun family.
Grandma "I'll be seeing you"  Shane "In the after life"  Ryland "SHANE"
This always happens. He adds in so much of unneeded talking and rants (not the one where Megan is talking about the bridge) but the jokes and everything to an extent is fun but when you title the video like that we don’t expect an hour long discussion and nothing spooky at all. We want the real deal. Man It’s getting old at this point.
Yay! Welcome back Shane, I’m so so so happy you’re back!
morgan looks gorgeous ı cant take my eyes of her
Please never leave us I needed you ❤️
Ryland’s mom look so young
cant wait, love u shane
The only thing I don't like is that we have to wait for the next part!! So glad you are back!! So good to see everyone's faces!
I'm so happy that you are back Shane. I was starting to wonder just how many time I could keep watching your food videos... You have been missed 😊
Love the support around youuuuu 🥺💗
I just noticed Shane didn’t ever mentioned his mom! What happened to her she was his biggest supporter!
Soo this episode 60% was just rambling again... great
Boring episode
Why is a predator making haunted videos for you guessed it, children?
Lol everyone in the comments switched up quick!! 😂
I literally dropped all my plans when I realized that Shane uploaded a new video. Great to have him back!
He’s releasing new videos when I needed it the most 😫
💗💗💗💗💗
💗💗💗💗
I loved this video the grandma at the end made so happy when she was happy he was making videos 🥺🥺
You really should get that medium Amanda to come over. Seen her in Sam and Colby's videos
Love how people are freaked out about the park but Poland is filled with mass graves and no one gives af 😂
Hope u guys film with Kendall Rae that would be amazing 😍😍😍
Previous comment made but thank you for coming back- I needed this
Y'all really chose to forget that this man built his career on racism for some shitty content that's only meant to make him richer?
Roland’s gran 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Rest in peace to all the Native Americans who lost their lives during the Sand Creek Massacre. So devastating to learn about that, however thank you for shedding a light on it!
Rylands dad is an entire mood🤣
I am so glad he’s back. still couldn’t believe it when I saw he had uploaded again!! 😭 I waited almost 2 years for this series!
A good video to pass time while breast pumping 😭😂
Wait what .. you can know that a battery is dead by licking it?
We missed you
Shane! F-ing finally!
Now I'm scared
Morgan looks so pretty 🥰
Loved the video I can’t wait for the next one! Also loved the shoutout to my boiiii Omar 🤟
Shaaaaaaane!!!!!! I’ve missed you!! And I’m so glad your comeback video is about a haunting! I’ve missed them! I’ve just been rewatching the old ones 😄 Welcome back! 🧡
nobody cares
i'm obsessed honestly
I need more!!! Roll on part 3
I missed this type of shane content. Sorry not sorry😄
27:26 lmfao litterally I needed that
I love how Ryland's dad balance the energy in the room. His comments are everything.
I don't care what anyone says, I missed Shane, and I am SO glad he's back!! I've been a fan of Shane's for so long that when he was "cancelled" in the summer of 2020, I was already aware of most of the things he was getting cancelled for. And over the years, he had already apologized for like 97% of those things. So I felt like I had already forgiven him for the immature/edgy crap he was known for doing early in his career. I had watched his content go from being super immature, and totally dependent on shock value, to the incredibly awesome series that he's been known for making the last few years. Internet humor was also much different back when YouTube was just starting out. Very few things weren't allowed to be shown, and people could pretty much say and do whatever they wanted. It was totally unlike what people were used to seeing in every day, traditional media. That was one of the things that made watching videos online so desirable. And the people who were saying the most ridiculous and shocking things were getting the most attention from the young people of my generation who were looking to find the next best shocking and/or hilarious viral video. So yes, I'm very happy that Shane is back. I feel like there will always be a place for his content on YouTube. And I know that I'm not the only one who doesn't want to let other people dictate what content I should and shouldn't enjoy online. I missed you Shane, Ryland, and Morgan!!! Thanks for coming back right when your content was needed the most!!😊🤍💫✨
how come shane videos titles are so uninspired and boring
Really setting the scene here. Im freaked out already and we havent even seen anything yet.
Shane will you PLEASE bring back your throw back conspiracy videos?!?! I’d love u just a lil bit more for it 😄😂😁
I missed you guys so much luv you Shane xx
Morgan is looking beautiful
Morgan is so hot
Collab with Kendall Rae is a must!
I LITERALLY DROPPED MY JAW WHEN I SAW THIS ON MY NOTIFICATIONS SKEHENKEHDHEJD  WELCOME BACK SHAAANNEEE I MISS YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU I HOPE YOU'RE DOING FINEEE 😭😭💖💖💖💖
31:39 in the Mexican lore, urban legends whatever you want to call it. The man in the fedora is considered to be the very devil himself
This left me wanting the next part so bad! 👀
Ngl I miss "the squad" but this is alright
Guys, can someone recommend a good book? Like with this kind of vibe? Something spooky or a thriller?
Really appreciate the chill jazz vibes at the end of the videos. Keeps me from pissing my pants
I so hope you keep this spooky stuff going I absolutely love it, I've rewatched the queen Mary and the Stanley Hotel, the graveyard one etc etc. You are the best shane so happy you are BACK! 👍🏼🥰👻🎃
the grandma is the coolest
shane’s content feels so nostalgic and comforting, i cant even begin to explain how happy i am for him to be back :D
Oh my goodness, I'm dying to see what'll happen in part 3, I just learned a lot about Colorado, it was really interesting.
Just in time for spooky season! Heeeey! Omar!
But if it is a restricted area, you should not he there ever
A 34min montage of other people's content 👍
Im so excited to watch this but I have to get my dishes done and dinner cooked so I can settle in and pay attention! Literally do not get excited for any other YouTuber.
i love rylands dad
Native American here! Unless you mean harm, as in you're doing harm on the land or you mean harm, or you're disrespectful. You should be ok
can't believe ur making me wait for the next episode 😒
I've missed u most shane😍
Love ya Shane. I’m so happy you’re back. Will always support you ❤️
Rylands grandma is so sweet
Shane can you please hire an editor?
You're still a terrible person. Please go away again
OMFG GF
irrelevant but morgan is so so pretty
I love Shane but I think he’s trying way too hard to make things that aren’t scary seem scary.
Omg Morgan looks beautiful 😭😭
I’m just angry that this was only 30 min long *hmph*  -_-
I wanna see less of other vloggers and more of shaneeeeeee
The only thing I hate about this is that it doesn’t go forever. I missed you so much!
I’m crying so much as a Native American with a native family this make me sad 😢 I’m glad your uploading again tho
Ohh noo don't bring poor grandma.she so sweet and funny,I don't want her to feel fear or Dred or anything bad at all.I love your grandma.and your mom and dad.GOSH I REALLY LOVE YOU ALL I just ff to the end,and nooo,no ghost hunting today either.but I'm still gonna watch it and enjoy it HARD.
👍
Why not wait till 3:30 am to watch this haha.
The end with the clock reminds me of unnus annus 😭
I am First Nations and I feel so bad about the other First Nation people in the war plz respect it
LMAO love how the parents are on tiktok and shane and ryland arent
Omg can Morgan be my bff and we can start a podcast!! FR
I am born and bread in Colorado 💯 and when I like and enjoy hearing new things I didn’t know before… but this video is making it seem way more than what is. Colorado is a native word… plus other states like California and Nevada and Arizona… it was native lands before so obviously there’s history… right?! Lots of history, the Wild West and prior.
Morgan is so hot
So glad Shane is back ! Like if you agree
Ive been to third bridge a few times. Its weird as hell and ive experienced some weird shit there
Omg  so excited for this video!!!! Love all you guys so much,the Adams family is the best. Hahahaha, Shane Dawson goes ghost hunting with the Addams family  I love being a part of the process,seeing you do research,and clips from the house etc,but I hope we get to the actual "hunt" today.
Ryland's family is so amazing! Love them and you to Shane! Keep going, you are so talented!!!
Ummm Guy’s did y’all not learn anything, why are y’all watching, liking, and leaving nice comments on his channel. MAJOR RED FLAG for all y’all doin that bs!!!
This is good , shane. I missed you. Please don't go back to the dark times. Please please please
Morgan is so freakin beautiful!
we gotta protect rylands father at all cost
Bruce was extra funny today 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is so good! Can’t wait to see the rest!
Um, Morgans eyeliner is GORGEOUS :D I didn't know what cool word to use.
No you are still wrong
Just thrilled your back!! Your an old soul shane..You have many more adventures ahead of you💚
Can ghosts skip through videos?.... i fell haunted just watching it 😅
These Shane series are the best
surely the finale is like 2 hours because i cant get enough of this :(
Colorado is such a beautiful place, but at the same time it has such a history! RIP to all the innocent that passed away in that massacre, I know this series is not going to be about them, but it was such a tragedy!
I want you to disappear but I also want spoopy content 😠
Sooooooo.... Happy YOU are Back!! You have a Beautiful Heart... Thank You ...
tbh Shane's videos' editing is keeping me
Are my 👀 deceiving me? Welcome back hunnii!💜💋
Shane, you’re killing me! I need part 3 now!!! Please don’t make us wait a whole week 😩
Awesome video Shane. I was so excited to watch this. Love how Morgan told the history. She's a awesome story teller. I love that you're back. Roland's family is so adorable.  Love how y'all are together. I can't wait for the next video.
"I might die..." "Yeah" 😂😂😂  Poor grandma is hard of hearing and just didn't hear what they said she just wanted to agree 😂
you can really hear the drums
wow
Love! Love! Love!!! Can’t wait for the finale! 👻💋💋
This video was great after a long final ❤️ so worth the wait.
I can't wait for part 3 I am so happy you are doing this shane 💗💖
WE’VE ALL MISSED YOU TOO!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There’s a city in Michigan called Wyandotte.. a suburb of Detroit..all the houses & businesses were built on top of a Native American burial ground..Yes, majority of the homes & businesses *ARE HAUNTED* !! I have family that live in Wyandotte, & I have experienced paranormal activity myself.. I don’t go to their houses at nighttime.. No thank you, sir 😳😩
Love the family xxx
10 minutes in. This is just a fake vlog at Ryans home
🥳❤️‍🔥
Shane is trying to talk about ghosts and Ryland and his dad are interrupting and talking about the devious licks challenge. 💀💀💀
Such a full circle moment for me to see Omar’s content being used in the video, so excited for the finale!!
Thank goodness you're back.
Another vid already!!!! oh baby lets go
Definitely cant wait for the next vid!
So glad he's back, I've had this void of dark humor that i couldnt fill
Not to be dramatic or anything but i’ll die for that brown dog (who looks like a pit) 🥺🥺
Wait  the male reporter named "Shannon"?
I grow up by cheesman park
Anyone think he’s deleting hate comments??? 🤔 Cause I’m not seeing any. I’m surprised he came back with all the drama he caused. I’m waiting for the Shane stans. ☕️
wat
LOl soverignern the n gurl comment's was not found. her "essay" might be deleted 🤣n
Loving the content Shane! So glad you’re back!
Shane y'all should got to riverdale rd in thortan! It's suppose to be haunted! Go so I can find out if it's worth it or not lol
Yesss!!!!The Best Start of my day!!!! Coffee ☕ + Shane's video yaaay 🎉🎊 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Shane's back and NOW Wants to torture us with the "TO BE CONTINUED...   😭
Ryland’s grandma is so sweet
Ohhhh yes god
How are we halfway through the video and nothing has happened yet
Keep going! This is great! Just, do be careful. Please.
Oh wow, Omar Gosh 👻💀
I remember my school days when we would fuck around in the bathroom and shit all before this trend lmfao
I kinda feel this is a bit draggy,  beatin around the bush...  A 3 part for just 1 place.
Life is better with Shane in the world 💖❤️🌍💖💕💋💗💖❤️💕🌍💖💖
Shane please do a conspiracy theory about Coronavirus and The Lab leak theory!
Wait… why are dads so weird?! 👀😸
Wait, why do ghost need Energy yo survive? I mean they’re dead?
Bye! Why was I still subbing tho this horrible man?
We hear and see a man running on our roof, he’s been doing it since my grandma was a kid
the fact you're back makes my heart so happy!
The annoying orange ??😂.........
I love you sm, thank you for coming back❤
Loved this!! Can’t wait for the next episode
why is shane standing off in the opening to the kitchen while everyone's sitting on the couch, giving off a not comfortable around ryland's family vibe.
Forever using the term creepy spookies AHAHAHA
Shane X Sam and Colby or Shane x TFIL Or even Shane X Omargosh
I’ve watched you since 2009 and I admire the person you have grown into. It makes me really happy to see you posting in a way that just feels genuine and raw. I think anybody that has seen you through the years would say that you have come a long way from those times. We are all products of our environments and unlearning prejudice and societal bullshit looks different on everyone. But when the effort is there it is clear. Thanks for being here Shane.
Morgan's sooo pretty! She's glowing! We love to see it!
Okay Ryland's Dad steals the show
I can't believe that they had omargosh in their video.
Rylands dad gives me life lmao
I can’t lie I’m thrilled to watch these kinds of videos from Shane again. No one can say they resonate 100% with all of the choices they made in their past.
The camera guys laugh🥴
Rylands family melts my fucking heart 🤗
Love to see you back making content again! It always felt like Colorado, North Carolina and Florida always seems to have the crazy cases. I'm sure it's just a coincidence but just something I've noticed.
I need part 3 & I need the DATE for it now 😭👀👻
PEEFECT FOR OCTOBER  SO CALULATED LMFAO   ABOUT TO WATCH OMG HERE WE GO SEATBELT BITCHES!!! 😬💋😅
Morgan is giving me Khloe Kardashian vibes dunno why 🤷🏼‍♀️ also I'm so excited for episode 3!!! I'm hooked 🎣
why are you back go away
The only thing that's scared me so far is how dirty Ryland's car front window is 😬
How cute is Rylands parents though 😩☺️
Excited
Noooooo anybody knows when The next episode is coming?
Your back!!!!
There are only positive comments on here… seems suspicious…….
Can we appreciate the fact that the editing of these video are so good! They look like Horror  Movies.
I watched this then had a scary sleep paralysis dream 😭 haven’t had one since I was a kid
I lived on humbolt in Capitol Hill 2012-2013 and went to cheesman park. Never had anything weird happen. Got v drunk for the 4th of July there tho lol
I’m *SOOOO* glad you’re back !! & I needed this video more than anything today !! Rough days lately 😩😩 Anyway, nice to see you genuinely happy, Shane 😎😎💙💙 Love from Detroit Xx
Ryland's dad about the urinal literally had me dying laughing ⚡⚡😂😂😂😂😂
When he ain't sagging cats he's pretty nice
Literally can't wait for the next one & why did that old dude did that to all of them i think that guy is so fu*kd up curse him who else agree with me
didn’t shame get cancelled
Probably shouldn’t have watched this at 2am
So glad you’re back!
I love this series, it was a perfect way to ease back into creating content. This was amazing ❤️
Are Shane you Pokemon! ! Why you making us wait for a week !!!!!    Just keep posting dude ! You don't know how much I've been waiting for this series , Post the Part 3 !!!!?????!!
33:01 "I'm happy that he's going to be doing this" awwwwww!!!! 🥺🥺❤❤
Yaaay we've missed you Shane! Love seeing y'all back on here ❤
🐈 🐈 🐈 hmm
Loving this series so SO MUCH! I hope Shane puts more content out soon following this. This is top notch and I know we’re ALL loving it. Thanks for gracing us with your presence when we all needed you !
Growing up going to chessman it’s definitely creepy and not somewhere to go alone at night.
This is the shit that I love!!!!!!
YAYYYY I love these even if they are stupid, I like to see people’s ideas and theories
...we waited for... This?
Shane what is the music that you guys used for the intro because i want it for my own short horror film
what’s with those kids destroying toilets for klicks. lmao. wtf is wrong with them.😂😂
Morgan’s dump truck and small waist OOO
I’m really happy Shane came back 💙🛸
I love you, Shane! You are the best ❤️!
Yuss! Living for this series!! Although in all fairness I would have loved anything that you brought out 🤪❤️
Even though I have zero belief in the paranormal, I love the spooky parts of life. I love October and Halloween. Most of all, I love that you’re back Shane. Life is just better with you in it.
I couldn’t believe my eyes 🥺💕💕💕💕💕💕
Yes.
I am enjoying Shane's new series. It brings back his old video vibes. And also, ghost hunting in Stanley hotel is also one of my favourite series from his spooky topic. I hope he is going to make more videos like this!
The fact that Morgan is single goes against the laws of Physics- CAPs.
Thankfully tik tok has taken down all of the vandalizing videos! Wtf kind of challenge is it to destroy your school bathroom. You’re only fu*king up your own bathrooms and potentially getting criminal charges!   Ppl really will do anything for likes!! These likes aren’t going to equal anything tho! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I’m back to life thanks for coming back I missed you guys !! Keep making videos for us we love you Shane and friends
I was watching this on my phone and my phone shut off 👀👀
I grew up in Aurora and third bridge was a huge deal to go to. We used to pack our car up in the middle of the night with no phone's ( I'm old ha ha) to try and hear the drums beating and stuff. But it was the middle of nowhere and the terrain was rough to try and navigate in the dark. I ended up breaking my leg because there was a cow crossing grate in the ground I didn't see and my leg slipped through and down I went lol. We grew up knowing about the sandcreek massacre and what happened there. Looking back we're probably lucky we didn't get shot going on private property in the middle of the night.
I need to look into the massacre to find out what evidence was found to prove the governor was responsible, was there a journal or something? Or do people just assume he did this fucked up thing?
The tribes have cursed the land, that is why many bad things happen there, I feel their Anger towards everyone that has taken over their land, specially the ones that were bad people.
I swear I never clicked nothing faster in my life an when I got here it just posted 38 seconds ago. I’m honestly so happy you came back to us an I speak for the millions of fans that are devoted and love you very much Shane! We’re all human an we grow! We’ve missed you dearly! ❤️
Apparition! Lol not Assparition. 🤣
How do the comments detect negativity and block it?? Crazy how you can just filter out the accountability 🙄
I'm just so happy for Shane. What the stuff he used to long for are now getting fulfilled. I'm really happy that he found Ryan and Ryan found him.
“OMG GUYS SONIC DOT E X E” vibes
I’m sorry but that brown dog is the absolute cutest 🤗🥺🥺🥺
Damn in the preview of the first video I thought Morgan lost weight, but clearly i was wrong
Yessssss
This feels like their town's Crybaby Bridge lol
The Adams family (omg wait) has a way of making me feel like I’m in the same room laughing
I'm very happy, that Shane is back! OMG! I'm SUPER HYPED!!!!!!
Don’t end this ohhhh my god😭 we have waited so long for you to come back! Please make this a series!! We neeeeeeeeed more
Morgan is a babe 💖
🧡🤟👌💕👍
I’m so happy you’re back Shane. I’ve been anticipating your return since you took your hiatus. Love you all! Thanks for coming back!
Okay love ! But did u have to scare me at the very very end of the video like that 😭😭
Was anyone actually there and correctly paid respect to the people who was unjustly murdered
Oh wow,well we were watching this vid,and my aunt says that my uncle,grandma,grandpa,and my dad are in these jars in our cabinet,that's creepy,so that makes this place haunted.....fluff that shiz.
YAAAS BITCHH 💖💖💖
Morgan speaking facts about Colorado!  I’m here for it and hope that the creativity keeps on keepin on!!!
Love you shaneee
Yes!!!! ❤❤❤
thanks shane
So glad i decided 255 am is a good time to watch this spooky shit
May be it's just me but Chris sounds just like RYLAND 😳🤯
This was a horrible experience. Shane which I love… should be embarrassed for hosting this terrible experience……
"I'm just a big ol white man that wants to show the creepy spookys" LMAO I lost it
Welcome back Shane❤️❤️ I only have one small thing, your camera guy! His laugh is the same as David Dobricks laugh. The over the top inhale and it gives out the “1-2-3 LAUGH!!” vibe. Very ennoying Besides that - love your series, about time you returned!❤️❤️
And most of you who said you are happy he’s back are the same people that cancelled him.
Entertainingly intense video aside Morgan is so beautiful
I’ve got to say. The editing on these videos is incredible. I love the ghost hunting documentaries because you guys are just so funny. Keep up the good work guys. 👍🏻
Makes me so happy that his back, he sure knows how to make a series addictive! Welcome back Shane we have missed you!Bruce is a legend too
I’m curious, is he not getting any money for these vids from YouTube?
Wow being from Colorado & never knowing this history- I’m blown away. It’s so insane & heartbreaking knowing that happened in this state I love so much. I really love the series so far & I can’t wait to see how it ends! Proud of you Shane ❤️
When I lived in Aurora, I remember going to Cheesman Park!
An aspiration of a young girl? Aspiration?
Thank you so much for coming back ❤️❤️ obsessed with your videos.
why are people allowing him to come back
I am beyond happy and excited Shane is back!
Im ligit doing the sand creek masacare in history lmao
It’s the most despicable lick 😈
❤️
This shit stupid.. hes walking around Ramblin looking like he's always scared of everything . So fucking annoying.  Shane's YouTube was better in silence..
“awe well i hope i don’t die”  “yea 😁” LMFAO IM DYING.
missed you bro
It’s the most despicable lick 😈
This editing actually feels like a movie. Shane is so talented.
Why did I decide to watch this late at night while laying in the dark..... 😟
I'm psychic, and I hate to possibly expose a secret but I see Shane secretly working on a horror movie now or soon, It does extremely well.
when i came to know he was cancelled i was so sad but NOT ANYMOREEEEE
Ryland’s dad is the main character!
Wow...I'm speechless. Fantastic Editing,Fantastic subject, Whole video was so interesting and chilling..Great Job Shane Welcome Back!!
“Everything follows me” 20m people on YouTube… 😂😂
I missed your videos so much !!!! I am SO HAPPY !! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️
Im so happy your back omg love you shane ❤️
Morgan is so pretty ❤️
The editing isn't great
You do not know how much I needed this in my life right now. I love you so much Shane. I never comment on videos but I feel like you bring me so much joy I just need to tell you that ❤
"Did they run out of dance moves" 🤣
YES OMG IVE MISSED HIM SO MUCH
The school bathrooms just look like a normal bathroom at south african schools😂
anyone from colorado wanna go explore cheesman? Lol
Grandma: I'm so happy he's doing this. Shane: Hope I don't die. Grandma: Yeah....   😂😂😂
Take it from someone who's mother passed away in their home then started having phenomenal experiences happen around the house. Someone who never believed in afterlife. All of the things thats happend to me im supposed im not in a mental ward 😪 stay safe out there all of you please 🙏  loving this so much.
OMG GREAT NOW WERE TALKING ABOUT MY COUNTY, CUTE
I love when Shane does scary videos. It’s different from anyone else who goes to haunted places because it’s not only dramatic scary it has tons on humor.
I needed you to come back and you did! I really thought you were done for real🥺 got me in my damn feelins
this is what i needed in my life. thank you for saving me
I’m so happy you’re filming again, butttttt I wish part 2 would’ve actually been visiting the 3rd bridge part. Too much talking not enough ghost hunting
Oh when you showed OmargoshTV, he’s such a good ghost «hunter»!! So scary, loved this!
Been waiting all week for this🖤
Ugh I’ve missed this.
I’m so glad you are back. I watch your videos when I’m spiraling
Thank God I was drunk for this
When Shane uploads it makes me so happy 🥰🥰
Bruh this is boring af
love this, love you guys so much i can't wait for the next part
Miss u and I’m so happy your back ❤️
Let me tell you I was not ready.
There were a couple kids who tore up the Walmart bathroom in the town i live in and then they caught it on fire and recorded it for TikTok. Lil shits had us shut down for a few days. We couldn't get diapers or baby food when we ran out. I live in Litchfield IL. Pretty sure u can look it up.
im glade shane i back i had a hard time and id just pull up shane vids and die at him being me
I’m excited for the series I can’t fricken wait have missed you so much Shane I’m glad your back not sane without you ..!!!!!!!!!! I enjoy your videos they brighten my day ☺️🙌🙌
Wow I love that this is like 10 mins from where I live great Shane thanks 😍
The comment section isn’t what you thought it was gonna be
God I missed Morgan so much
Colorado has some creepy crimes.
I'm still a fannn.❤️
Should do a video with omargosh great guy thanks for putting him in video
Rylands dad is everything !!! Lol moms needs to let him talk and stop being so uptight lol hes hilarious !!! More dad and grandma please 😂😂😂
I lived in capital hill. It’s really fucking haunted. Especially the apartments I lived in.
It’s crazy because I’ve been wanting a horror movie that leaves me scared afterwards so be careful what you wish for is so fitting because IM SCARED
Okk but Morgan's glow up is Everything!
this was amazing again, i’ve missed you 🥰
Now im exited to go to estes park again i hope i run into shane and ryland that would make the whole trip better
Is it just me, or do they all look happier and healthier since moving?  Shane looks great, and Morgan is full on glowing.
Hey shane, would be so cool if you could include captions so it is more inclusive. If you like i would do it in English & german :) Lot of love ❤️
Hey Shane... this comment might not get to you since there are a lot of others commenting on your content but.. if it is, then please, listen. I used to be a huge fan, I would watch your videos beginning to end of day, everyday.. but.. I just can't get over the fact that you've been sexual towards children and animals... its just not a topic I want to be supporting.. please understand my decision, as it is one I'm sure many have made. Have a good day 🤍
Watching this at 2:30 am😮‍💨 wish me luck
This is edited and put together so well Shane🧡I’m so proud of you, can’t wait to watch one of your horror movies some day
I watch a LOT of spooky stuff yet had never heard of this park yet. It definitely scared me!
Shane can't wait for part 3. Hoping you all are doing well. The whole time i was watching i was laughing then got the spookies lol. Love seeing everyone. Grandma you tell them lol. Dad needs to go to the schools find out who tearing up the bathrooms. Might save someone's, ya know lol  With love & Hugs to all. 👻❤️❤️👻
Shane we love you. Thank you for coming back. 👐❤️
YAYYY
“If you declare with your mouth “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). Now is the time to accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior. Obey His commands and repent of your sins because Jesus is coming back soon. Tomorrow isn’t promised.
Rylands dad is literally the main character in this video 😭😭
Every time I see a video with Morgan in it, she’s more stunning than last time
Love u Shane, Ryland and Morgan!! I'm  So proud of all!
Im sorry, but if Shane and Kendall do some type of a collab or investigation i would dieee🤩🤩🤩
I love Kendall Rae!! Would love to see a collab 💕
So is pedophilia like that thing people could get forgiven for now ? 😂😂
I’ve been there and I heard the drums 😭
So glad you’re back Shane !
Shane: always uncomfortable when talking about hauntings and ghosts and dead people  also Shane: constantly makes hauntings videos.   Dude. I didn't even hate you for the old videos, I hate you for this dumbass act you put on where you act like you give a fuck about a ghost story. Stop doing that shit. It's so fake, it's so unbelievable, it's so demeaning to the audience to act like they're dumb enough to believe it, it's just insulting. Honestly, what the fuck are you even going for here? You constantly act like you're super emotionally impacted by a fucking ghost story and then proceed to make a 30 minute, highly-produced video discussing it and profit off of that. Just be honest and act interested in it like we know you are. Don't fake this fragile, emotional wreck that you want people to think you are. You're a fucking millionaire. If you're that fragile, you can afford help. If you're too fragile to return to SM, that is on YOU.
The schools deserve it they waste all their money teaching the dumbest shit
Did I tell you my grandfather died peacefully in his sleep? The passengers weren't so lucky they died screaming as the car toppled down the canyon..... 😉
MORGAN IS GORGEOUS, she need to stop playin
Shane, seeing you back means so much to a lot of people (including me!). Seeing in you CO is so refreshing!  Please keep the videos coming!  You and your family are so loved! 💖
Okay kendall!
Bruce is such an OG
Shane I missed you so much!! Love the family. Morgan looks beautiful 😍
I can’t tell you how much I missed these videos from u Shane. These are my one of my favorite videos (conspiracy/haunting videos) on YouTube and I just love them so much. I’m so glad you came back and I so glad this is what you love to do because it’s what I love to watch
Really sucks Shane had to dick suck the media and apologize for something he never did wrong in. Miss OG Shane and his real crew.
So glad you are back Shane I so needed some content from you as recently I've survived the Dixie fire, vandalism, theft, family member in intensive care..... thank you for the smiles I REALLY need them.
Is grandma gonna come?   Ryland: she wouldn’t hear them coming…  Everyone 👀👀👀  😂😂😂
This watches like a A24 film and I love it
I can't believe they just said f*CK it and built some shit on top off all those people  left behind  lol jeeeeeeezzz 😭
Hm interesting
I've  missed you too.
Yesssssssss finally.  😁😁😁😁😁
watching this in 1.5x is an ✨experience✨
Im scared
Sooooo just saying.....humans have been practicing the act of human burial for 1000’s of years soooooo....the probability of you standing or sitting on a dead body at all times is almost 100%....so the fact that cheeseman park is on top of a cemetery isn’t that significant...
Damnit. I knew i should've waited till it All came out. Grrrr
The hat man would haunt me too when I was younger…haven’t seen him in years tho
Glad your back Shane !
I'm happy that Shane is back. I hate cancel  culture. We all made mistakes.  I really missed Shane's content. I really do feel so bad for him. He seems like a really nice guy and I would love to met him one day
I'm sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for next part
The fact EVERYONE was shocked Morgan was speaking such fluent sentences without messing up or stopping 😂😂 I was like wow Morgan congrats lmao
wow this video really taught me a lot about key moments in history!! like at 32:09. i had no idea the annoying orange was back
Despite the bad things and errors shane has committed im still a fan everyone makes mistakes some worse than others but i gotta give him the benefit of the doubt ive watched him since 2009 and im glad he’s back.
This is everything!! I love that you are Back and hopfully happy:)) sending love from Czech republik
I want to use the ouija board in third bridge ibh i wanna mess with the souls of the damned
Y’all gotta go to Riverdale road in Colorado
“Did you know the annoying orange is back”
Yup 👍🏼 I’m team Dad
My heart is literally so freaking happy that you're back! Like, words cannot express how much I've missed you. <3 <3 <3 I can't wait for part 3!!!
Can we talk about how happy and radiant Morgan looks lately?!
posted this at night now i have to wait till watch it till morning
I’ve been to the bridge… it’s so creepy!!
AND I HAVE MISSED YOU!!!!
Wow “20+ deaths since the 1980s” whoopty do. There been 20+killings in the past month alone in nyc
Easily some of the best videos on YouTube
Ugh please don’t make us wait another week!! Lol
This cameraman is overreacting
Thank god you’re back, your content literally (not even kidding) stops my panic attacks and anxiety  😂 I’ve missed you 💖 looking forward to your amazing one of a kind content once again! 😄
flop
My husband doing the kindergarten drop off and me watching this while getting ready must be the best start for a Friday 🤗 greetings from Germany
Ryan's dad is spot on. People cancelled Shane for making jokes they didn't like or understand but no one gaf about the kids actually commiting crimes and destroying their schools.... Don't they read The Crucible in school anymore?
I knewwwwww cheesman park was gonna be brought up. Welcome to Denver Shane 😉😉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“you’ll feel ‘em” 😂😂🤣🤣
you coming back clearly proves you don't care about what you did
Ryland. Humble yourself
Why are these white people surprised of the slaughter of native americans
bullying is ok sometimes
So glad Shane's back man.... truly we needed you Shane.
shane uploading again is literally the highlight of my whole year.
This comment is for the haters since I see a lot of them responding to ppl.                    *Just leave. We all know what happened and what didn't, so it's fine if u don't want to forgive. Leave us alone 💋*
SO glad your back!! I've missed you so much!!!
it's called a devious lick
My favorite kind of series!!! Especially from you, it’s just a great mixture of humor and interesting details… Proud of you Shane!! 🥲 Thanks for always being real, and being literally my comfort YouTuber, so excited to see more from you!!!!
I love you but why did you make us wait a week for investigation only to have banter and back stories :/
really Shane? You make a big come back and come with this? Disrespectful.  Native American massacres are not something you should film about without a basic knowledge of race.
Missed you Shane. Glade to see new videos.❤❤
douglas county things 🤩
I miss the og crew
"California is toxic" me, who moved 3k miles to California in january: 👁👄👁 yes
I'm so loving that you're back Shane. I was distracted when you got cancelled but I've always supported you. You did NOTHING WRONG. I'm loving trying to explain to idiots what humour is. Please don't let anyone tell you what to say again. I miss your dark humour. One day we are going to be like "remember the Social Justice puritanism of the early 2020s? Wasn't it awful? Never again...."
Rylands dad is hilarious and so passionate about these bathrooms.  Bruce for School Board 2022-2023
Thank you for posting again shane ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Shane: "I hope I don't die 😢"  Grandma: "Yeah 😁"  I love Rylands grandma lmaoooo
I’m so glad ur back Shane ur absolutely amazing
I used to get so upset when my aunts would take me to cheesman Park. Only when I got older I understood why I disliked that place so much.
The ghosts at cheeseman are cruising
So great Shane telling grandma well I hope I don’t die grandma yeah🤣😂 that’s great
Not the creepy nursery music 😭
Sooo excited for the next ep! I’m glad Shane is back. Every video of his never fails to make me laugh!
😭 PLEASE MAKE MORE THEORIES  😭
Nothing better than coming home from a long day off work to a glass of wine and Shane's new scary video. That's what I call ending the night right 🍾🍷
MORE CONSPIRACY THEORY VIDEOS PLSSS
some of these edits have me dying like at 14:59
Uggg...now I gotta wait for part 3 😭  Glad you're back Shane!
I love you
STOPPP I used to sleep in my car in Cheesman Park when I would skip class LOL was woken up several times by some veryyy interesting people
I am coming from omar!!!🥰🥰
Yesss!!! We've missed you too!! Only watched the first 40 seconds but gonna like it anyways because I know it's gonna be great!!
Not sure who’s editing the videos but a little constructive criticism but the background audio is so loud it is kind of distracting and makes it hard to hear what you all are saying but other than that it was a great video. 😊
the corpse flower has absolutely nothing to do with corpses. It's called that because it smells like a corpse to attract pollinators
I’m so happy he’s posting again
Shane you need spirit box for these series.
ummm Rylands dad is the main character
I just have to say Morgan keeps blossoming more and more beautifully every time I see her! What an absolute QUEENUHHHH!!! 🌺🌺🌺
LOVE this series and can’t wait for even more!!! Love you Shane!!!!❤️❤️ been supporting since day 1
didn’t know i needed this… but i guess i did
You know what makes me wonder  . . Why don’t we ever see animal or dinosaur ghosts/spirits?
See this place reminds me of Egypt Valley in Morristown,OH. I’ve had so many experiences there like witches and ghosts. I’ve had people in hooded clocks chase after my car at one of the two cemeteries that are located in Egypt Valley. Fr so many legends of ghosts and people that have passed there. Like lady bend hill leads right to Egypt Valley and some women had passed there and you’ll see her down in the pond located at the end of the road which is old route 40 stops there
When I first started watching the screen was completely black and all I was getting was audio I thought that was how the intro was but then it continued on and I was completely invested in only hearing this video until I realized that it was a malfunction and I re started YouTube and watched it in all of its splendor 😂
So I see cancel culture don't apply to the yts
I hate the Annoying Orange 😂
To all in the video please, please remember to call them indigenous peoples!!!
White man so bad
Please give Grandma Janice a hug. I lost my own Grandma Janice (it was her name too) in July and it still hurts everyday. 😢 Its so great to see her fully involved in the family squad and being loved. :)
I have waited for a chance to sit back all week and enjoy your return. Just watched last weeks and getting ready to watch this now. Welcome Home. You were missed and I L O V E your new house. So warm and rich (not monetary) the colors and feel yum. Hope you guys are enjoying the reset and looking forward to your content. Grow, learn and keep moving forward. What is the line from Star Trek discovery?...She says "Helpless is a shitty feeling, but it is not forever, and it doesn't make you any less capable." Powerful words to take in...Please do. Again Welcome home. 🤗
Does anybody else think Morgan looks fantastic? Like she looks really good
Shane delivers!! This is soooo good, like a TV movie. I'm so glad he got his mojo back and we're the lucky recipients of his creative genius. Perfect timing around 🎃 Halloween.
"I don't wanna die" grandma: "yeah" lol also Morgan would be good speaking about spooky stories! I'd watch that quick!
That park is just a smaller version of Savannah GA 🙆🏼‍♀️
Omar is my favorite investigator so made me happy to see him so I believe 100% I’m invested now
Omg Kendall Rae 😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️✨
ayyy his back
It’s too fucking short and nothing happens like come on you can’t come back with something a little better than this? Do you really need to space them out a week apart after everyone has been waiting and then it’s 30 minutes of you talking to Ryan’s family.
Why did you come back😐 we didnt forget😐
Shane I sure did miss you
Lol I love the passion when Ryland’s dad talks about the kids vandalism the schools etc and about the creepy park etc…..it’s like you can almost feel his energy
fake ass videos 🤦‍♂️
Love that your back shane but i completely forgot i cannot watch your vids at night 💀😂 have me up scared as shit
Woot ..part 2...here we GOOOOO!
Rylands grandma is the one we all need right now! we must save her at every cost!!!!
Morgan, you are such a good story teller! I have goosebumps 😳.
So good to have you back man ♥️ Means so much, to so many people.  I mean, people make mistakes, but they also learn from it. Besides, we all have made mistakes, and he’s just as human as you and me. We’ve missed you Shane!! And I would live to have a family like that!! I would live to have a family at all 🥺
F I N A L L Y!!!!!!!!! 🙌🏽
Bailey sarian has a podcast talking about this battle  Dark history episode 4 & 8  I just listened to it today it’s mind blowing
Yessssss so excited
this is so funny i literally live across the st. from cheesemane park LOL
The scary clips and jump scares ALWAYS get me! STOP THE OVER-EDITING plssssss
Camera man & the editing have gone down noticeably.
Shane We have needed you so much this past year 😫 I'm so happy to see a post 🙏🏾❤️
Wow! Shane , I have missed you. Nice to see you back  living large! ( no that was not a reference to weight) Ryland and Morgan, good to see you both looking as good as Shane! Morgan you are  still so smart and  Beautiful! So who is Chris, besides the cameraman?
Devious licks vs Rylands dad
Omg Morgan looks great!
The guy who licked the battery killed me😂😭
Ryland’s dad seems like the person you just want to sit down with a beer and watch a football game with.
Dude the editing- I can’t take this serious 😳
Kinda mid.. we need more scares and less clips of other YouTubers.
that was the longest consecutive thing that ive ever said jsjd me
I cannot wait for the next one!!!
“I hope I don’t die” “Yeah”
YESSSSSSSSSS
I wish the episode was Longer….
✨ iconic ✨
third bridge is also so fucked up, i went once and saw a shadow of a woman and refuse to ever go back
You’re making those haunted forest YouTube videos back when YouTube was new but you’re actually making it good
I have had a horrible day at work but coming home and seeing you’ve posted a another video has brought me so much joy💕💕💕
Morgans so pretty🥺
Y’all did a 180 REALLL QUICK
The fact that I possibly live like 30-40 minutes from them is amazing to me. I’m sure they get their stuff delivered but the chance to even meet them is oof! And Morgan if you read this I’m new around here and have no friends 😂 you ever wanna just shoot the shit sometime as friends let me know
You can tell Shane is depressed :(
Happiness looks good on you Shane! Great to have you back darls
Been waiting forever for you to make videos again your my favorite I love you!!!!! Keep doing your shid baddie 🤪
I make bad decisions to watch these before I go to bed 😭✋
Can’t wait
The thing is, the video isn’t scary but the editing is.
Please someone buy Chris a Camera Grip...
I seriously hope this series continues!! I love it and I’m glad your back!!!
Any other Aussie watching this and laughing at the reaction to the kids destroying bathrooms bc in Australian high schools that’s just normal
Finally something that I can watch ❤😆
Shane’s back 💕✨
I literally love grandma 🤩🥺 such a sweet soul.
what’s up with the music during the cemetery scene.
Does anyone know the date for the continuation on the part where they actually go?
Me coming back to work like nothing after disappearing cus my bank account low

Creepy
can we please talk about MORGAN???? she looks so pretty.
Note on the TikTok challenge! My sisters school has this happening! I went to get her homecoming tickets and as I was entering a mother was screaming at her son for ripping a teachers hair off!!
Still glad you're back Shane, I'm eager to watch more of your adventures
Welcome back shane
Just like a park here in Kingston ontario, mass graves of people who died from the plague, were buried and in the 80’s90’s was turned into a park and it’s haunted along with all the houses surrounding it
UGH I FUCKING LOVE U SHANE
Yes!!! When will the finale be coming up!
I love seeing them describe *devious licks*   I want them to do the ☁️Holy Yields☁️
I DARE YOU TO PLAY RANDONAUTICA....

Thank you Shane Had a long day at work and this was perfect to relax me  Awesome work as always! 🙌❤
Bruh these lil clips he be showing be scary af
So glad Shane is back! All we need is Jenna Marbles to make a come back. Literally the king and queen of YT.
Lived there "peacefully". LOL I don't know if I'd really call murder, torture, r@pe, and slave trade "peaceful", but sure.
He’s back :D
31.40 the cowboy shadow creeped me out. U have to pause at the right time.
My old routine was watching Shane's videos before I go to bed. Im so glad I can do that again 😭💙 Thank you Shane!!!

i missed you omg
What happened to Morgan’s Colorado home?
I love it I need more missed you love you
SHANE WE ALL MISSED YOU, PLEASE NEVER LEAVE AND KEEP DOING WHAT YOU LOVE <3
I once did a Ouija board session at cheesman park and the person we were communicating with told us that they were unhappy about their final resting place. Very cool to have you in Colorado and have you covering stuff like this ❤️
lame
Shane’s gone back to what everyone dislikes, bro be for real, be organic, everyone is sick of your “front” your Shane, you have money, you got canceled, step up, move on.
Rylands dad cracks me up I love Shane’s videos
I love ghost hunting shane!
Talk about perfect timing…. Love you Shane, fan since 2008 from Saudi Arabia
I mean, Bruce is not wrong about California 😂😂😂
Next part of this series shoild be an hour long or im suing lol i love you shane so glad ur'e back in the most amazing time!  Its halloween season!!!! 🤣❤
SHANE WE MISSED YOU
Immediately looking for the new annoying orange after this is over 🤣
Can Rylands family adopt me 🥺
i really appreciate his growth after being cancelled. i think he really worked on himself which is all anybody could ask for.
OMG WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US SHANE . YOU REALLY GONNA SHOW US YOU GOING TO THE BRIDGE PART 3
Morgan looks so much happier. I’m so glad for her.
I keep thinking that Morgan is Tana-
Absolutely love Ryland's family! Reminds me so much of my family and of when my grandma was still alive. We live in a rural community near Canada which has the same type of feels. So glad you're back!! :)
rylands dad talking about the devious licks 😭
Love you daddy Shane ,I am so happy to see you posting again been watching you since I was 10 I'm now 22. Wouldn't change that for nothin
"Don't things follow me?" - At least 20.1 million of us. lol
So good to see you back, Shane ❤️ Can't wait for the last part! And I hope there's much more to come, your videos always make me feel so happy 😊 They are interesting, funny and spoopy (yes, I, for one, still use spoopy!) in all the right places!  And don't care about the haters. I sure as hell don't. So you haters might as well save your breath and go hate on somewhere else 😘🤗
My brother and his friends went there, and the scariest thing that happened was that his friend accidentally stepped on a baby bunny and killed it. I have the video if you wanna see
Wow this is some serious history <3
Can I just talk about how people ridicule Shane for being a lot of horrible things, yet how do we even know he IS those things? I mean, how do you know it wasn't just messed up jokes? I'm not trying to condone the actions or anything, it's just. Maybe you should actually know the intentions behind them before judging.
Omg Shane you guy’s should go and maybe start a little series about that scary ass park
I love the family❤️
Yess!!!!! The queen is back in action !!!!
Thanks so much for that jump scare at the VERY END
Just starting the video and its confusing is this the 3rd part?
You HAVE to go to riverdale road!!!!!
Collab with Omar ,
i live in Denver and have been to Cheesman park hundreds of times and that place is MESSED UP
Shane and Kendall Rae just posted new videos today, I have never been more excited lol
Watching shane video about ghost ..it reminded me about my ghost experience..like I'm 26 right now ..but when I was 12 year old..I had my door locked..im relaxing in my bed ..eye close but just relaxing..I felt a cold like very cold hand ..grabbing my right ankle..like hard way ..when I wake up ..the hand feeling was gone ..no one was in my room ..my room was lock ..I was freaking creepy out ..even ask my little brother or parents..if they sneak into my room ..touch my right ankle with cold hands..they all said nope ..I was like 😱 ..my mom said it might been my guardian angel..so far it ever happened again ..but I always keep thinking about it ..sometimes..who touched my ankle like a ghost or was it really a guardian angel 🤔
I feel like the editing in this video is so strange…
I’m so happy!!
I'm scared
The "okay..." from Ms. Adams sent me
Omg it's Omar gosh tv here .😃
👁👁😲 I'm scared 😱 🥶🤯
I’m so glad you are back, I loved watching your videos but people made me feel horrible for watching it. I’m so glad your back I missed your vids so much❤️
I’m so freakin happy and excited for Shane. He’s finally back and doing spooky vids again and now he has a bunch more places to explore/film being in Colorado! Makes me happy that he’s doing what makes him happy
I’m so happy to see you happy Shane! Keep it up you make the most comforting videos i’ve ever seen😃
I am so glad you're back shane 🥺❤
Yaaaaay shane!!!
I agree with ryland’s dad. Fuck California! So damn toxic
Holy shit, Cheesman Park is _literally_ the real life “Poltergeist”.
I am so glad your back! I can’t wait to see what comes next 😊
Morgan is so freaking Pretty!
Shane just makes my life better. Period. ✨
I’m going to have so many nightmares. Love you Shane 😂♥️
You guys should go to the Batman Movie Theater! I didn't realize you were in Aurora
I don't care about your past. You've grown so much and I love you for that.
Shane’s killing me with these 3 parts. He’s been gone too long I feel like he never even left tho
Ryland's dad is hilarious 😅💀💀💀🙈
My great grandpa was full Cherokee Indiana this has me crying.
Enjoying this series...especially since it’s October, the weather is cooler and the wind is blowing...👀👣🔪⚰️☠️. I just spooked myself just commenting this comment...😱😅
Please Dont stop shane
Shane I am so glad you are back making the incredible content you are so great at. Your artistic ability and your creative story lines to your videos surpass any youtuber on this platform! You are such an inspiration coming back still being yourself, being so authentic. You know the critics and their bs and nit pick everything goes to show they wish they could be half the artistic icon that you are! I am so happy you are back, much love to you and Ryland. Haters are gonna hate and be honest if they don't get it their just thick headed. Keep on keeping on my friend! Much love here from DEUCELone!
Rylands g ma seems very cool. I bet she has some pretty exciting stories and I'd love to hear them.
Best part of my week so happy you back and making this masterpiece 🖤
I love cheesman park I’m like 30 minutes away from there I go a lot!!
Quick btw Morgan is looking more beautiful everyday.
rylands grandma is a literal gem. i love her so much
When I saw he posted two YouTube videos finally, I literally called in sick from work so I can just make a quick cup of coffee and watch this. I was feeling so stressed and when I saw his videos again I was just in the zone. I'm so happy he is doing better and that he is moving forward from the things that happened. I think it was a safe move from him. Mistakes happens. Always will love Shane ☺️
I just love the part where Morgan’s like ‘someone’s in the trunk.’ And Shane’s just like ‘why is someone is the trunk?’ XD
Ryland’s mom trying to keep Ryland’s dad from getting cancelled by telling him to shut up every time he starts going too far is everything, lol!  😆
I’ve missed you more❤️😊
Rylands dad is my new fav person!!!!
Best start of the morning!
im not arapahoe or cheyanne, im lakota. but i never knew of the sand creek massacre and that just made me tear up, it reminds me of the wounded knee massacre
HE POSTED I CAN T BELIEVE ITTTT HE POSTED AAAAAA
Are we just forgetting everything he did
Cool
“A 3-part Shane Dawson Special” - chills. So incredibly happy to see those words again
Please don’t end these Shane, it’s so enlightening and educating to know these things in history because no one touches on them anymore, they’re just “forgot about”. There’s so much indigenous history in my country as they were out first settlers and they NEVER taught us any of it in school yet go on google and there’s historic sights that are protected now that holds MUCH history that some of us will never comprehend. Metaphysics, indigenous extraterrestrial type history also
And now iam scared to live in Colorado iam on haunted soil grate
I absolutely love this for you! So happy you’re back to uploading❤️👏🏼.   You dropped this about 2 years ago….👑here you go king
Okay… at 31:39 freaked me out a little. Then I realized you guys had added that in.
Love you Shane! Keep going with these videos! Haters are nothing but haters!! You deserve this platform ❤
Nothing like watching Shane’s video and realizing my 10 year old sister really just got in school suspension from these stupid TikTok challenges wtf LOL
Honestly this is ridiculous. I live in Colorado - and it is WAY populated, you are NOT more likely to get murdered here, and it isn't more haunted than California. This is reaching.
YES! The most I've laughed all week!! I hope the next episode comes quick!
I just want to say I appreciate Morgan speaking about Native Americans in such a respectful, tasteful way.. Also Morgan you look so good, your glow up was REALLL!
I used to live in Cap Hill not far from Cheesman park! You never went there at night. Ghosts aside, it’s really scary to be there at night. Lot of hiding places along the trail.
Anyone know how Momma Dawson is? I would love to see her. Some of my favourite Shane videos were the ones where he would show up randomly and she was always so excited to see him every time. When he brought over Jesus 😂 I just miss Shane and mom content
i've been waiting for this ❤❤❤
I love how grandma will say something incredibly nice and endearing and then look into the camera and say “yeah” so proud 😂😭
I just wanna say that I missed this. I was one of the people who unsubscribed because I hated what he did in the past. I saw that he posted again and rolled my eyes and that was it. Two nights ago I was up late and saw the first video on my recommended and scrolled past it and then I went back and clicked on it. I saw the piano bit at the beginning and laughed my ass off. I was smiling through the whole damn thing. I went and watched all the videos about the house and the move on Ryland's channel and I couldn't believe how much I missed you Shane. I've been watching since I was about 13 years old and now I am 18. I resubscribed last night. I can't believe I ever left someone who brought me so much joy and laughter. The spooky videos were always my favorite, so it's fitting that one would bring me back. I hope you don't stop again on account of people like me. I hope you keep growing and making a life for yourself and Ryland. And I hope to whatever higher power there is that you keep making me laugh like this. I love you Shane, and I'm not leaving again.
Come to Helltown, Ohio
Old day content using modern day technique 👌😌👌
Morgan looks so hot 🥵 I think I’m not gay anymore 🤪
Ryland’s parents is like the best
I’m so easily scared. Like, I haven’t seen most of the og conspiracy videos because I’m that scared….but I’m watching this all the way no matter what! 😂
Rylands family is so pure ❤ I love them!
Uhhh…. Chris W didn’t kill/ burry his wife and kids on the west side of America. This happened in SC/NC state so I don’t understand what the relationship is with you bringing this up on y’all’s West side….. there’s no relationship, especially with spirits so….
Ok i need part 3 ASAP!!
Yo…Morgan lookin hella good!!😍
Yes!!!!!! Shane is back!!!! This is gonna be gooooodddd💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
Love this series.  We are so glad you're back Shane!
Welcome Back ! #WWG1WGA🇺🇲
I love your family. Shane you are lucky to have them and they are also lucky to have you. ❤
Ayeee that’s my mom 💀 26:12
Some evil entity might follow you back from the haunted place.
SO FUCKING EXCITED YOU ARE BACK! LOVE YALL! XOXO
The house I used to live in it was a grave yard. And they didn’t move the bodies! We had a spirit that was pissed and we has abs shit happen! We moved out after the spirit tries to take me over and started to smell something horrible like sulfur and rotten body!!!!
Yawn
I hope Shane did his homework on how Omargoshtv stages his videos
Shane is back<3333 I love it
My brother lived out there for a few yrs. But now back in IN
As a Native American, I don't think it's necessarily offensive what you're doing but just know that we would never go there, like we don't mess with that kind of stuff lol I mean all these cultures that go to war over petty differences and one of the things they all agree on is not to mess with the dead. I'm just saying. Maybe its for good reason.
Morgan is so beautiful💕
Rylands dad reminds me of my step dad. Same humor and all 🤣
Missed these videos 💕
Omg Morgan is so beautiful 😍
Shane have you heard of riverdale road in Thornton, Colorado?
Looking forward to next episode!
This is some bullshit I want the ghosts and I’m tired of waiting this has been prolonged for 3 parts when it could’ve been one hour long special I love Shane but this shouldn’t have been a series
I feel like they can my my history better
Morgan is so hot
the editing is atrocious, get a tripod, get better lighting, a mic. draw out a story board so ur shits cohesive, cut unnecessary shit out. don't mass compile clips from other people, use ur own footage. i mean all this after a year break?
Can't wait for 3
NO WORDS. If I start talking we'll be here all night. BUT, We all need to commend Shane for bringing awareness to Native History. Shane has the ability to highlight issues and he chose this.
Man. I needed this. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Rylands dad is my fav. He’s so pure.
I thought Morgan bought a farm house in Colorado too? Her n Ryland said they’d have matching tractors lol. But now she’s living back home! Does anyone know what happened??
the jump scare 😭🥲
SHANE. WHY U GOTTA ATTACK DENVER BOTANIC GARDENS LIKE THAT
Finalyyyyyyyyy ive been waiting so long for a video!! Welcome back OG!
17:13 got the step sis energy
i’m so happy shane is filming again
The dad is so funny omg we need more of him.😂😂😂
Lol I’m watching this at 3:24 am 😹😹
Gosh finally woo-hoo been waiting for your return and on my birthday! And during October! Best time!
Morgan is so beautiful
Bruce said it best, “California is just toxic” AMEN, HALLELUJER 😭😂
That is the saddest fucking story ever about the Native Americans 🥺 They were just trying to live a good life with their families not bothering anyone
Welcome back!!!
Can we talk about how gorg Morgan is? like, hello?!
ryland’s family is everything
take a shower jesus christ
I really missed your conspiracy and creepy videos
i’m native american 🥺
It’s so good to have you all back 💜✌️
Eeeeee the Kendall Rae moments in there
Chris’s laugh >>🥲🤍
am i gonna get haunted watching this💀
okay but Morgan is BEAUTIFUL
Man I missed Shane and I just hope he continues to upload more..
HES BACK WHAAAAATTTT
This is too creepy to finish watching at night, I’ll watch the rest tomorrow morning
It's still so surreal to see you pop up on my recommended. I'm so happy you're back x3
💘🥺❤️
Morgan honestly looks amazing 🤩 live your life girl!
Shane came back for spooky season ❤️👻
So happy your back ♥️
Ive been watching ryland vlogs and shane uploaded.
When they were making fun of grandmas hearing 😭💀😂
“it’s just a prank bro 🤪” the prank: 21:55
You all need to go up to black hawk, CO. Everything is haunted there. Knights of pythias cemetery is so haunted
Shane, I’ve missed your videos sooo much!! 🥺🤍
Dude, my mom is now living in Colorado now (for the past 5 years) and I just texted her about these locations!  She never heard of them til now, Im gonna send her this video too!
Please contact Denver’s botanical garden’s security service or someone similar who works there. They have multiple tapes of paranormal entities of the surrounding area and park that walk around (more like crouch and peek). I’ve been on plenty of ghost tours throughout the States and never seen anything like it. You guys need to see it
Shane, please stay off Twitter..if you ever want to know why people are the way they are, reach out to me. I have A LOT to tell you! Btw, the fires in California were to drive out the Republicans and middle class. California is where the bots live.
Can't wait to see more Shane!
Been here and a sub from about 16-17ish...now I'm 26 and still here, been here..not long ago it was almost "how dare you stan Shane Dawson" like it was "cool" and "trendy" to hate on/cancel him, I'VE NEVER HID MY LOVE FOR SHANE AND HIS VIDEOS! BTW is it too much to say I cried at 2am when I seen he was #1 TRENDING on YouTube..maybe lol but it's the truth, KEEP DOING YOU SHANE CUZ NOT JUST ME BUT MANY OTHERS ARE HERE FOR IT! ❤️💯
This is amazing Shane! I am so proud of you!! Welcome back to the king of horror ❤️❤️🎉
Side note, tell Ryland to clean his windshield 😂
WTF was this crap!?!
Have all the videos been this heavily edited before? Its really getting on my nerves.
So happy your back Shane!! Cant wait for the awesome content 🥰❤
Yayyy! I have had such a bad day and a stressful week and I’m just glad that I have Shane, Ryland, Morgan, and Chris to put a smile on my face 💕Shane, even though I’ve had a rough week and I’m slightly depressed you have helped me so much! Your motivation and pure happiness gives me strength! 🥺
You came back at the right time, Shane 😔
Around 13:00 it starts to give me the ring video type vibes. Almost like I’m watching a cursed film and I’m scared to go to bed now. Lol
I DONT LIKE THE CAMERAMAN, ID RATHER HAVE RYLAND
id never move to Colorado 💀💀
Omg I love that brown dogs face! So expressive with his light brown eyebrows.
Can we talk about how you can hear the drums playing in all audios even in Shane’s clip like clear as day 🤯 I had to put my phone up to my ear but just bc their was talking but then you hear it and it gave me the chills 😱 literally so excited for pt.3 to see more of that clip with the drums playing bc that was wild. Perfect timing for Halloween 🎃 love ya guys always 💓
I love how his dads so mad about kids destroy public school bathrooms like he paid and made the bathrooms 🤣
why does ryland keep talking over people
Got news I got a new job today. Got off my other job and come home to a new Shane video. Ugh my life is good rn
Morgan is literally the prettiest person ever
I like how he’s prepping us for this place by telling us about the dark history there and being respectful about it in the process 🥺 I wait with baited breath for part 3
Omg I live for this!! Yassss
I’m going to be so sad when this is over... I really hope you actually start a series like this where you go to multiple haunted places not just in Colorado but all over! & eventually come out with a scary movie. All the scary movies these days suck.. I think it’s time for a Shane Dawson one!! 🙏🏻🙌🏻💙 so happy your back, let’s keep it that way! Love you so much. Xoxo
The wait is over 😈
so happy you're back Shane, missed you so much❤️
So freaking weird.  I’ve been haunted by a guy that looks like that.  My son saw him in his dreams.  He’s always in the water.  Rivers oceans etc.
This is literally what I needed for spooky season🎃! Love Shane’s videos!💗
Shane is not a busta. Haters are fool!
Did I get a second notification from Shane?
This was such a teaser. Can't wait to see the finale. Keep up the awesome work Shane. Missed these. 😊
You can definitely tell the difference on how Shane’s videos are edited now. I think the beginning was a bit too much idk 🤷‍♀️ I’m exited for the series tho. Btw Morgan looks so ✨stunning✨
Who else watching before bed
YESSSS
The corpse flowers scientific name is Amorphallus titanum, from ancient Greek meaning Giant Misshapen Penis. Do with that info what you will.
SHOUT OUT to OmarGoshTv ... GimmaKiss😘
Morgan did give me slight Kendall Rae vibes while talking on the couch about third bridge.
so excited about this series!!! can’t wait for the next part! i’m so glad you guys made it home safely <3
I feel the camera man needs to practice  😵‍💫
I missed you💖
I just literally don’t care about whatever stupid shit Shane said in his past. I am so happy to have his videos back and I love his sense of humour so much. And I know he means well in his heart. You go Shane 👏🏽🙌🏽👏🏽
yes been waiting for this
Editing is on point. So glad to have you back!
Rylands dad is like 70 years old and hes worried about school bathrooms.. old people must perish
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Shane, thank you for coming back!!! We all missed youuu!! Nothing scares me more than your scary videos I love it!!! Love you Shane!!!
What terrible content lmfao
I love these videos because they have so much rewatch ability glad Shane is making more authentic content
Moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is horrible and embarrassing lmao
I was having such a down day and I really needed this. Thank u for getting me out of my head for 34 minutes.
Shane: “I hope I don’t die” Grandma: “yeah 😁”
Shane and Ryland are already DAMAGED but I feel bad for the kids watching this and being fooled like clowns
Omg I am absolutely in love Shane!!! You are going somewhere I have been 3rd bridge. And yes we heard the Drums heard the screaming and yes our car died in the middle of the bridge. I will never go back. So thank you so much 🤗🤗🤗🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍 for letting me relive happy memories.
I have to be honest, I’m not into this haunting ish, gives me the heebee jeebees. I just watch for Shane, Ryland, and family.  Just saying.  Still love your editing 🥰
Ryland has a Hank Hill dad and I love it😂
Not me going to the Denver botanical gardens earlier this year and not knowing I was stepping on dead bodies 👀
The way Morgan is staring at the camera man😅😏😏
Really want to watch but im a 🐔  Ill wait till morning 😐
I love Kendall Rae!!!
Ryan's dad like any other dad/parent that knows a little about socialmedia.... tic toc and the bathrooms on repeat... haha  gladly not a thing on our school
I need more of this series! So interesting to hear backstories of haunted places. As a Indigenous person, so glad the tribes in Colorado were acknowledge.
I’ve never felt so safe while watching a YouTube video ❤️❤️ I love you Shane
I actually cried thinking about the Native American who were invaded, robbed from their own homeland, and killed. Thinking that it could have happened to Indonesia back in the day, in a way... well...
“I’m just a big old white man that wants to show the creepy-spookies” 🤣☠️
Morgan gets prettier every seconds
Shane’s videos are always so entertaining there is never a dull moment. ❤️❤️
Ryland’s dad and his grandma are the funniest ppl on earth. They literally crack me up. 🤣
His dad is on something he’s tweakin brush
We have a very similar folklore story here in San Antonio with railroad tracks that are haunted 😮 where kids who have passed will push your car to safety
Omg I’ve been to that park😧
Morgan is gorgeous ❤️
❤️❤️
The whole video is clips of other videos
"i was taking a piss in the boys bathroom and my penis caught on fire!!" IM DEADFDBNWAJUIK TGBWAUJIKTR
Yesss!! So excited for part 2!! Thanks shane!!
New series idea: "Shane pulls off the most Devious of Licks"
AH YES, FINALLY
Ok the angie video is still giving me chills
Love ur work
Greetings from Nickisnotgreen's stream ✌️
Damn i kinda wish the first part was more like a part 0 and he’s just like Hey im back! Then had the three parts.
This paranormal shit is boring and probably a foreshadowing of a new eyeshadow pallet “the paranormal pallet by Jeffrey star and shane.
Omg the third bridge! Hello from a Parker Colorado native!!!
i missed u so much i am so happy
I hope you do a vid on Cheesemen Park!!!!!!! 🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾
ANNNNDD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY RESPONSE ESSAY 3 TOPIC  FOR ENGLISH CLASS ,   As some one who as have some Native American (not sure what tribe YET) in them I love when bring light to these topic
Love to see you back shane 😭
I’ve always said a lot of sad things happen in Colorado. 3 mass shootings happened there.
*Side note: Morgan is glowing ✨
Ffs thank you. Iv so bored with YouTube without you guys
I feel bad for the people around Shane. They had to deal with much of the hate that Shane brought on himself. The guy sold his soul to Jeffrey star
Shane's videos just bring me sooooooo much comfort
Some people last month at my school, stole a projector from someones classroom
I am having SO MUCH trouble focusing on this being spooky when they keep saying "Cheesman"
THIS is the Shane content  I  always enjoyed. I am glad he is back to posting this content.
7:50 students at the high school around here put a snap/ tiktok out for the principal foreskin 🤣  These kids are getting dumber and dumber the labels on crap for what not to do is going to start being a small chapter book at this rate.🤣🤣🤣 Also the school lost 3 toilets and 4 sinks and even more paper towel dispensers and hand dryers. It’s just getting bad.
Where is the scary? You guys just keep talking and talking ..... I have to wait another week isn't it? 😭😭
I just have one question where is shanes mom?????
This series is everything 😂 love Shane and the Adams family 😂♥️♥️ always golden content
noooooo its only 30 minutes long i wish it was an hour!
So happy you're back!
The scary music stopping every time it panned over to the old guy in the glasses 😂😂💀
most of this video is just bad jokes and you using other peoples content man
What a foul video, I thought this series was about ghosts. so far the first episode was just 80% filler and the other 20% is Shane actually ghost related. The same issue is within this episode, 50% of the episode was them saying the same things they have already said, and I can’t believe Shane even brought up the Native American, adding sad/intense music, and trying to gain sympathy to distract us about what the actual episode was suppose to be which is ghosts. Now we’re going to the 3rd episode and we still haven’t seen them at the haunted location, I wouldn’t be surprised if they made this a 10 episode series but only 2 episodes actually there. I’m not hating if that’s what you guys think I just want to leave some valid criticism so hopefully the next series isn’t like this disappointment.
Back off leave this poor old woman alone
Yayyyyy I’m like so happy when I first saw that he posted I was hood up lemme get my chips and my popcorn
Shane: I hope I don’t die!  Grandma: Ya
I am going to start a motion to have Shane go out searching for Brian Laundrie he will definitely be faster than the FBI
not the annoying orange lmao
I’m from Akron Ohio and in our neighborhood there’s a park that was built on the graveyard for an old asylum. There’s something like 384 graves unmarked there. It was always an urban legend until a few years ago When it was confirmed with scans on the ground
It’s great when you’re picking up dog shit and see the notification that Shane Dawson posted a new video! I love rylands dad!!
Omargosh!!! 💕 I love him!
Look how pretty Morgan is damn girl
Hahahahaha Shane “I hope I don’t die “ Grandmom “ya”  Lol I love it. U guys made the best move EVER.
I’ve been missing this content
As a school cleaner, please think of the staff who have to clean up the mess and damage you cause. We are people too.
"Did they run out of dance moves" 💀
Are there really NO bad comments? I'm living for that! I love Shane, but even people who don't love him should really just go on with their lives. Life is WAY too short to be worried about some guy on the internet that you'll never meet. Y'all keep up them good vibes. Hating on someone, only makes YOU miserable.
I'm a school cleaner in Canada and I can confirm that kids are destroying the bathrooms even here 😅
yes omg shane squash the idiot tictokers😂😂😂
shanes gotta be paying a comment moderator good ass money lmao no way this comment section is this nice
Loved this so much 🖤🖤
Been waiting 6 hours to cuddle up with my tea and blankies and candles and snacks to watch this!!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
I love my amazing ideas to watch the videos around midnight every time. such a great idea!
Cheeseman park is kinda creepy, spent a lot of time there growing up.
Im so excited for the next part and more videos to come, dont be discrouaged Shane!
I'm so happy you got OmargoshTV he's amazing but his friend Moe is a fake.
i miss shannon ogden... :(
Jesus dude go crawl into a hole again until you can actually genuinely apologize
OMG I’m related to black kettle!
Scariest part @15:27
I always watch shanes videos at 4 am and it gets me so creeped
keep going on Shane. Love your content. Ryland is just as fab as ever. This is from a disabled combat vet, keep going. The shyte only lasts a little while, after that, it is a better you doing better things
I really would have liked to see the faces of these heinous individuals. Why hide them now???
Glad the content is back shane. Btw morgan is sooooooooo damn fine😜😭
wished this episode was longer, i soo soo soo missed jumping into bed wih a snack and watching your videos, cant wait for more to come
IM SO HAPPY FOR U SHANE! loving the content ❤️
Learn your lesson Shane
Morgan is literally so pretty. Jealous. haha
First reaction upon seeing a video by Shane…. 👁👄👁 am I being punked?  OMGGGGOOOOOSSHHHH 🤯😍😍😍😍😱😱😱🤗🤗🤗🤗😭😭😭😭 Lots of emotions! Ok now I can watch the video ❤️
I need part 3 noooow! 🤩🤩🤯🤯
❤❤❤❤❤
Yay
I been to 3rd bridge and we sat there until like in the middle of no where we heard someone screaming as they was being  hurt badly
I've missed you Shane!! and also plz do more conspiracy videos
Love you Shane 🥰
Shane will probably never read this, but this is for him. as someone who struggles to find anything to look forward to (genuinely) and has also gone into isolation and wiped themselves from the internet due to mental health issues, I’m so glad you’re back shane. Really. Thank you for deciding to rise above everything and do what you love.  I know the internet is really good and really quick at making you feel as if your impact on the world is negative. It’s never been the case. from shanaynay, all the way to now, every version and character of yours has had a great impact on alot of lives. you are putting a lot of smiles on people’s faces, and taking me out of my world and 100mph mind for 30-55 minutes. Or even 5-10 minutes back when the food videos were a thing, that was always the first thing I’d watch everyday after school. Anyways, love you shane and I’m so grateful you’re back. I hope I get to meet you some day. xx
Third bridge just seems like Munger road but to the MAX
A kid in my school stole the whole urinal
I havent even watched this yet but I want people to realize that if you FORCE an apology out of someone.... is it really an apology? Its not genuine. When hes ready to talk, im sure he will with us, but hes staying onn brand and just having fun. We should let him, cancelation ruins LIVES.
finally
Yyyyyyaaaaasssss. Was waiting
Love your inlaws shane your truly blessed ❤
Boy the way you edit. A masterpiece!
So how scary is this on a scale of 1-10? Wondering if I should watch alone...at night lol
OMG Ryland’s family and your in-laws are amazing! I wish i could be a part of it too! Y’all all are so freaking amazing!!!! Love love love you!
I'm absolutely loving this. Thank you for coming back.
Did ryland really just say that they used to bring girls to a place specifically because there was no service in order to try to have sex with them and they can't call for help?? Wow...
Omfg im glad you back ive been watching the old haunted videos wishing for more 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞please bring back the conspiracies cuz there is a lot to cover ☺️👍
So happy your back 💗
Morgan is such a vibe!!!
I stan rylands dad 🤣
finally omg
Welcome back 😁
Protect grandma at all costs !!!!!
AHAHHHHH im so happy shanes back in the game <3 my life is slowly getting better now
Incredible!!!
Omggg i cant wait for part .... 3  :D
Y’all look great    Morgan is gorgeous
CAME BACK IN CLUTCH
Love it cant wait to see more. You should also do an alien or alien sky investigation series at some point. Youd make it rad
I can’t believe that stuff was in 2018
Absolutely nothing happened. I used to like your "series" or "docs" but now i just can't seem to get into it. So long and drawn out and way too thick with background horror theme music. just not doing it for me. sorry
Okay but the cameraman was annoying I was trying to hear the drums and he kept talking lol
Morgan you're smarter than this bullshit run while you can, NOW
I love the part when Shane says "they follow me right? , Ryland said "who ghost , demons me 😅😅😅💖💖y'all are so cute living for this series missed you Shane 💓
😎. P. S Morgan when is ur next video 📷 girls I'm getting old just by waiting for u📷🧓
Top tier editing with the cheeseman park explanation! Very spooky
Papa Bruce was the start of today’s episode to be honest
Ryland's dad is a whole mood!😂 I love it!
Why does Shane have the ability to make me so happy? ❤️
❤❤❤
Should be doing this series with graveyard girrl 🥺🥺🥺
Shane should make a video on the Devious lick or a reaction to Devious lick
I feel bad for being white! What a terrible thing that happened 😔
Ryland's dad is a whole mood 🤣
Shane uploads… I sit down at night and freak myself out…and at the same time I am the happiest person ever 😂😅
bro the dumb devious lick challenge- literally we have to get hall passes now and sign a sheet before using a restroom 😭
“Big old white man that wants to show the creepy spookies” lmao I missed you Shane!
I audibly cackled at “she wouldn’t see them comin’”
OMGGG YESSSS
bro they have a park like this in my city in canada, right by the boarder if you want a tour/description of my stories ;)
Morgan should be a history teacher. I would of A+ it if the line started with “idk some governor that sucked. “ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cheesman Park sounds like a cool origin zombie movie.
The way Shane expects everyone to stay serious for his videos but does whatever he wants when he’s on anyone else’s vlog 🙄
So happy for your new series can’t wait for more
Morgan looks AMAZING!
Thanx for raising awareness Shane I missed u! Iv done dumb af shit when I was young as well. Still luvz u, Im new too! Shane and Britney's back bitchez!
I can't wait to watch this new masterpiece when I survived work 🖤
STOP POSTING
I'm finally out of work and can watch thiiiiiiss
Fun fact I used to pick strawberries outside a cemetery when I was a kid until I got old enough to know they are literally growing on top of bodies. Maybe that’s why I’m so fucked up today 🤷‍♀️ people juice berries.
Rylands family is the best ❤️
love your videos :D
Am I the only one that rewatched all his videos waiting for him to come back ??🤣
I had a conspiracy about shawn been dead, it's good to see he is alive.
I've cried after watching both videos because I've with you since 2010 and we've been riding this Rollercoaster with you and I'm so damn proud of you Shane. YOU deserve to be here and happy. I love you and always will. Thank you for coming back. ❤
The Kendal Rae appreciation was great
The way these videos are edited is the best.

i forgive you shane
Shane is great at storytelling,  you can't deny the talent and editing skills
no one forgives you
i dont forgive you shane
You should go to Riverdale road in Colorado. It’s said to be super haunted as well as “the gates of hell” is in Colorado to.
I love that shanes back. Seing his videos pop up again gets me so excited
I will forever love Shane idc and I never will
Im luvinit...i watch alot of crime stuff such as crime talk and that chapter...also loved the show homicide hunter w/lt joe kenda who solved some of the most horrific murders in colorado...needless to say id rather admire colorado from a distance...
0:39 *lmao i thought it was Shane's body*
ryland's dad is suuuuch a dad, and I'm here for it!!! 😂
I fucking love that he’s back !!!!!!!!!!
I fucking love Bruce
Shane!!!!!!! I’m so happy to see your face again
Bruce was very entertaining in this video his song lyrics at the end were quite something lmao!! Loved the video thanks Shane. I really appreciated hearing the entire backstory to where you're going and the sad historical events that you shared.
So sad I have to wait a whole week for the next one! 😩😩 we missed you Shane! 👻
8:59 look at the chair & table behind shane please someone debunk this shadow???
Spooky vids are coming back at the perfect time
Love the fact that everyone stops what they’re doing to watch Shane lmao
Only Shane can make me hysterical laugh one minute and then scare tf out of me the next. I needed this in my life.
Glad your back man
I like how it’s the dad talking to his kids about tik toks threads and not vise versa lmao
"im just a big ol white man that wants to show the creepy spookies". me too shane. me too. except im a woman. lol.  i am truly captivated by this episode. makes me wish you made videos all the time. you are talented and i hope you do get to make movies and documentaries one day. i think you would be amazing at it. ty for sharing this with us all. <3
Bro you have no idea how long I have been upset that you left this platform I love you with all my heart!
Tell me why i’m a legit Colorado native and I had no idea Colorado was so haunted 😂😂 and i’m way into the paranormal too. How did I miss this
This Cheeseman park is nuts. And bone 🦴 chilling😢😭😭ewww the botanical garden smells like rotting flesh
Shane posts. Me: SHUT UP! Dads on 🥸
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how beautiful Morgan is!! ❤
Ryland's whole family look just so nice and welcoming
These long news compilation edits are legit giving me motion sickness somehow. What is this editing?
Okay so I waited till night time to watch lol I want to be Morgan’s friend. She has such good vibe. Not that you and Ryland don’t it’s just … yup lol
I know he’s done some shit, we all have, but this and the last video made me laugh so hard and i haven’t had a good laugh in a long time. Thank you shane🖤
I can't wait to see the last part I love this series ❤️❤️ I love horror movies paranormal anything spooky since I was 5 watching nightmare on elm street and child's play.  There is a channel called TFIL that go to haunted places like asylums prisons Lizzy Bordon house axe murder house etc that's where I get my spooky content past year and half. I would love to see Shane do something like that not every video be investigating but maybe once a month ❤️ Also I want your movies you written to hurry up and be made lol I can only imagine how amazing they will be I love you Shane ❤️❤️❤️
I was going nuts trying to figure out the news anchor Shannon Ogden 🙃 he was an anchor where I live.
God I love it shane, spooky season baby!
Woahhhhh that's wild.. most of this i never knew... ty for posting loved it..
The amount of joy I got when you posted again . Thank you
I’ve got to stop watching these at night god damn it
So glad you’re back shane, you’re my comfort youtuber
Morgan is honestly so gorgeous <3
YES SHANE AND KENDAL
Omg GRANDMA aliens have landed and are destroying the entire planet!!!  Grandma: HUH?
everyone here is as basic as they can get
My thoughts on this video:  Morgan is literally stunning.  The park that has bodies on it is horrifying.  The family is back and I love it so much!
I could not get my eyes off Morgan the girl is literally glowing 😍
Everytime one of your videos ends, im not ready haha; I want to keep watching!  Can’t wait for the next one!
I missed you so much Shane!♥️
Im guts
Shane is the only one that can make a paranormal video cosy and comforting at the same time. Loneliness feels less depressing. Thank you shane
Bruce: “California’s toxic”, no lie was detected and I’m from California lol
"California is toxic" never were there truer words said! Love it!
Shane your videos puts me in such a good mood!! Been waiting all week for part 2!!!! 👻👻🖤
just retire already omg
Yes so Excited been waiting for PT 2 all week thank you for returning
I've missed the Morgan, Ryland, and Shane OG crew
Bruh the one guy who licks the battery and then goes "sigh.. its dead.. like those massacre victims..."
People building on top of areas you shouldn't, not only is the USA sick but it is also Spirituality sick
I LOVE YOUUU
14:12  not Morgan breaking the tension 🤣🤣🤣
Shane's editing still on point😁
shane if you want to make contact with light beings look into doing a CE5 ceremony with Dr steven greer.  look up the documentary close encounters of the fifth kind. real  light beings are a blessing and might help you heal. not dark entities  light beings aint scary tho so idk dif kinda vid idea
Love this series! Thank you Shane!!  I live in northern New Mexico and I loved hearing about the history of the area and the stories that are legendary of the land. Incredible series, again, THANK YOU 🙏
Yass 🙃
I'm so happy I finally have something to look forward to again I have always loved your videos ❤❤
I feel like i earned extra credit on social studies for listening to that lesson
I don’t believe in ghosts, but I miss Shane’s content and it’s more like a scary movie for me lol 💕
y’all wth
I wish I could just benge watch this 😭 so excited for part 2
I’ve always heard that if you hear the drums to run and get inside😶
The ghoul squad is finally back
Oh yeah.  This is what I've been waiting for since March '20.  Got me some Ryland, some Morgan, and now some Shane!  Man, when you came back I was so psyched, thought it would be "testing the waters."  But no, you got Chris (new icon) and decided "we are DOING THIS!"  Love me a man who does what he loves and we love what he's doing.  You never left, I never unsubscribed, I believed your talent was too strong and you would come "back" to the room when it was the right time. It's def the right time!!!  YAY!!! 👏
can Bruce Report the news for me
Omg I am so excited about these videos. Shout  out to Omar Gosh.. love his channel and he is such an amazing person. So nice to see him on your channel. I can't wait for the finale 😍😬
The content I NEED rn 😙
Look at Shannon Ogden the news guy. I racked my brain wondering where I knew his face from, and realized he used to be the news anchor here in Jacksonville florida. Small world.
Can I rent grandma? I need that kinda love and comfort in my life, shes the sweetest thing
Need more shane vids. Stat!
editting/mood is a bit much chris. dont make it seem like one big trailer.
Tell me I'm wrong, but that brown dog looks like the sweetest thing in the whole entire world- im literally crying
This was a great teaser , I can’t wait till next episode, I  have missed Shane’s videos , the  supernatural, ghosts and conspiracies. Welcome back❤️
Literally please stop saying ki ki  You sound so ignorant idk it’s not a word you can use
Ryland’s dad: “we’re going to find out real quick who it is” 😂
I literally have chills watching this video I hate scary stuff but I find this so interesting 😳
Me: :) Shane uploads Me: :(
Ive been feeling sick today, my father just bought me a rly good hamburger, it just stormed, I got tickets for a Billie eilish concert. And Shane posted this.  I rly like today.
Ok but now ima need like a 2 hour long episode
morgan looks like the girl that played charlie on good luck charlie
I love how they showed omargoshtv that was one of his videos going to the bridge
LoL...in regards to students completely destroying bathrooms. I can confirm. My son is in middle school and when he needs to use the lavatory he has to sign in at the time that he enters. Mind you there is a gentleman guarding the entrance. So, yet again. He signs when exiting. Whilst dealing with girls, a female would be present to monitor. As stated before...the young lady will sign in  to use the bathroom and sign out once she is done using the bathroom. I surmise that kids these days are a bit out of control. It all just seems a bit f***ed. Correct me if I'm wrong. At the very least, hold onto the kids phones while they are in class. Hold the phones once they arrive. Return the phones at the end of the day. When I was growing up I absolutely had no access to a cell. These young kids don't need access to cell phones either. Just my opinion.
Bruh I am shaking, I am watching this in vr (on my phone to type this comment). So Scarry, glad your back Shane!
i agree with bruce , these kids get away with too much, and janitors don’t get paid enough to put up with their bullshit
My name is Krys. Every time you say "Things follow me Chris" I get chills!!!
My question is, if the dude doing the transporting got paid per casket, what would dismembering the bodies do? It doesn’t actually give you more caskets to move? Unless he was provided with unlimited caskets per body part?
Aren’t u gonna delete my posts ?
Poor little Boston Terrior can’t get daddy’s love, though he tries.
needed u. <3
Well shit now my pregnant ass wants to go check the third brigde out lol might go this weekend 🥴
ThAnk you thank you thank you thank you
This was everything 😂 i really need this energy and laugh ! I love you guys so much 🥺💓
1:06 ASPIRATION  OF A LITTLE GIRL.  I cackled. Apparition lmao 🤣
Ahhhh omg omargosh made it to shaneeeesssss vid🥺💙💙💙
Not them talking about the diabolical lick 🤣🤣
"Im ready to squash ..lets do this...welcome back !!" 😂😂😂😂
Bruce is awesome!🤣
“Ghosts, demons…me “ lol I love Ryland 🤣🤣
Shane lying on his back in Cheesman Park at night. Yes? Yes.
Rylands dad was really on one this video
nice 30 minute long trailer Shane.
Ghosties we missed you!! Hi Shane Missed you friend!!!
Mr. Adams has some reallllll strong feelings on the tiktok trends lmfao I freaking love thst family!
Don’t pull a Logan Paul
Thrilled to have you back, and definitely feeling the nostalgia watching this video.
ummmm i would rather one long video instead of three parts
I didn't watch this u til I got food, wow I'm literally speechless
Another great installment.   Really looking forward to next week.  Thanks for adding in the history as well, you tell a story lie no one else!
*sees a new Shane video*  Me: welp, good thing this movie is almost over, because I definitely don’t care, I’m already in bed with flaming hot Cheetos and root beer (diet)
Im honestly happy that shane is uploading again tbh. His vids brings me comfort!
Ryland's grandmother reminds my of my grandma that passed away in 2006 please give her a hug from me and all your fans and please love and cherish her while she's still here because i miss mine dearly she is such a beautiful soul!! ❤❤❤
I've been waiting for you!   Welcome back 🖤❤🖤
I’m convince Morgan just heard someone else say the word kiki and does NOT know what it means.
Does he reply? 🥺🤍
I've always loved Shane's content. My siblings and I have been watching him for years now and watching him now after not seeing him for so long brings back so many memories. Thank you for coming back Shane. We missed you. I can't wait to see whats in store
So excited for the third video 😊
Missed you Shane xoxoxo
I fell in love in 2011 at the Denver Botanical Gardens. I wanted to hurt myself for 6 years after. I felt like something horrible attached itself to me and I couldn’t figure out what was happening until I separated myself from Denver overall. Something strange is happening in that city.
Fr they still haven't gone 😑
Holy shit. I drove up to this place while on vacation this summer and had no idea
okay i'm hella scared right now watching this, but can we also talk about how pretty morgan is!!!
Shane look up Gold Camp Road :)
It is so good to see Shane back and doing what he loves.
Morgan and Shane sitting on the couch gave me such Tana crying to Shane about Tanacon vibes
the camera man is so annoying!!!! like stfu with the unbearable laugh
Shane do you know about Riverdale road?
This place sounds just like Black Star Canyon in Orange County, CA. Been there. It’s terrifying.
I don't know if you're ever gonna read this but Shane you got me through the worst breakup a few years back. And now you just came in on time when I'm having a breakup now. We love you, thank you.
so happy you're making videos again! Rylands Dad is hysterical.
Kendall Rae 💕
I have a ghost 👻/ spirt that lives in my new house and to EVERYONE out there….this is EXTREMELY real and I suggest to leave the spirts/demons alone….they can attach on to you or do far more more worse! This is not something to joke about….the 2 past owners of my house died from heart attacks and were only 30-40 years old and were completely healthy….I bought the house alittle over a year ago and knew NOTHING about its history and out of the past year I have only spent on and off all together maybe a month and we are trying to sell it.  My four year old son was being attacked and kept saying there was someone in his room at night and even though I believe 100% in spirits etc I just thought he was scared to sleep in his new room alone and then he started getting huge deep stretches all the way down his back….and I knew he was telling the truth bc he couldn’t reach these spots that he was getting the 4-5 inch long stretches….all I can say is that we have been staying in a hotel since the last time where he had 3 long stretches but the last time actually drew blood 🩸 I have the pictures and plenty more evidence….we just had a priest come to bless the house but he had to leave before he could even go in our basement and he suggested to us to no longer stay there and that’s another reason we’re staying in a hotel but I just want everyone to know THIS SHIT IS REALLY REAL…. I have and still am very intrigued in the spiritual world but know I understand and respect it to a WHOLE different level! It’s terrifying to see your four year old with blood dripping down his back and saying they said he was bad and just awful things! So I just ask for everyone to be safe and to understand what your doing and the consequences of your actions!
Okay but why does Ryland's house give me paranormal activities vibes
This new season of dexter is wild
Im 100% sure that these comments can’t be unmoderated
i thought ryland was gay
So little happened in this video.
I haven't watched anything on YouTube in forever. Gets notification Shane drops video, welp I guess it's time to go back. So happy to see you :)
As a Native American persons, (& I only speak on my own behalf), I would be low key offended but only if you go there and mock what you hear or feel or see. You need to go there with GOOD intentions and an open  mind. If I were you guys, I’d take a Native American with you to Smudge beforehand & maybe even to sing an honour song on their behalf. Let them know they are not forgotten.
Lol Morgan was def channeling Kendall! I would love to see you all in a video together you’re all my favorite!
Finally the wait is over. I missed u
When mom comes in and explains it all with house settling noises
Thank you for posting youtube links of featured content creators 😊👍
“she wouldn’t hear em comin” 😭😭😭😭
Bruce is a legend! ❤
Does anyone else get the Adams Family theme song stuck in their head when Ryland's fam are featured? Despite this annoyance, love seeing them. They're iconic.
I was going to say "The ending music is so peaceful!" then BOOM.
I am so so happy your back shane ❤  this series reads so you and I love it
i forget so often this man is fucking 30 YEARS OLD LMAOOO
Bruce is my favorite now
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
we missed you more shane. love u forever 🥰🥰
plz plz keep making content like this 🙏  its so good and WE missed you soooooo much, king 💖  ily ily ily 💕
Im scared “ did you guys hire somebody “ lol
Be waiting all day to watch this !! I'm so glad your back
morgan looks so pretty 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I'm so glad your posting again you helped through such a dark time and got me out of it  and now I'm going through again. I buried my dad yesterday and and my grandpa last Thursday due to covid and it's hitting me hard. Thank you.
Wow, congratulations. You literally put out two 35 minute "investigation" type videos that are just irrelevant to anything paranormal, really.
Shane I say this every time. Your talent creating videos that make you feel like you watching documentaries movies blows my mind. 🤯  I feel like I am watching something I should be paying for. Your talent is beyond amazing! I'm always awe with what you create. Thank you. Love you! ❤
What about your mom Shane?!?!? Did you just leave her like that 😥😥😥
“Whatever you post on social media stays forever.”  Damn ain’t that the truth, Shane.
life finally felt complete when shane starts uploading vids again!
My eyes are WATTERING WATCHING THIS AHHHHH WHO WOULD BUILD A FUCKING PARK ON A GRAVEYARD
An infamous place to visit and that is within close proximity to my home town is a place called Bloods Point/Bloods Point Cemetery. Google will give you any information you might want to know.   I’ve seen a lot in my life and have lived even more, but have been close to death for the last six years now. When you are dying more quickly than others, you tend to experience what most cannot. But that place…that place does things to you. It did to me. And that was back when I was still alive, so to speak.
Remember yall, when youre a problematic youtuber just go away for a bit. The internet forgets.
SHOUTOUT KENDALL RAE MY QUEEN ♥️♥️
I'm so glad you're back Shane. You were missed very much. Love you
I’m glad your back and I remember when I was having a hard time I would put on your videos and laugh
MORGAN IS SO FUCKING STUNNING😩
Why do I always wait to watch at night
Tell me why I learned more in this video than history class
17:10 was the ACTUAL moment I fell in love with Morgan. Holy moly she’s gorgeous, funny ugh I wish she liked girl
You have me in suspense, third part better be worth the wait…
Thick Thick Morgan have my bald babies please
Rylands dad gives me major trump supporter vibes.... like boomer in a bad way...
grandma a whole vibe lmao
Yay!!
Why do I hear zak Bagans voice
hey you literally kissed a 12 yr old GIRL wtf…? WHY ARE PPL SUPPORTING HIM???
The fact that this is my neighborhood makes me jealous I wasn’t invited to come along for the adventure.
Yes!!! I’m so happy you uploaded!!!! I’ve had a terrible week and this is just what I needed to make it better! Thank you so much Shane! ❤️
well grabbing my filming equipment and heading to this Third Bridge this weekend.
This might seem like a dumb question but why did he blur that Nathan guy’s face??
I think Bruce Adams is my favorite person.
literally what is this he’s a manipulative weirdo don’t let him have a platform !!!
shane, for real look up what’s been happening in canada this year. hundreds of bodies of children found buried at multiple indigenous residential schools across the country. similar to the bodies buried under the parks…
Love that your posting again Shane, but there’s one thing I’d like you to address. Remember Eugina Cooney? The girl that you made that video about? Where you made highly insensitive jokes about your weight after knowing she had a eating disorder?
Honestly, this channel can be a dedicated horror related things and I’ll watch it every time!
we've missed you bitch!! welcome back
The devious lick thing is still funny . 😁 I would’ve loved to have been in school during this trend. I wouldn’t participate but, I would love to sit back and watch the chaos unfold. 👩🏼‍🌾👩🏼‍🌾👩🏼‍🌾
I absolutely love this and I love the family side that you guys brought into it! It's the family everyone wants to be a part of and wishes that they had. Thanks for letting us join your adventure
Yaaaas I loved the video🐷❤️🤣
Nooo one more week of waiting 😭
These are actually pretty boring I couldn’t finish the first one and I thought this one would be better I’m not even past the half .. /:
I love that Shane’s back. I’ve missed him
The video could have done without Some of the background music
Grandma is the STAR!!! 🌟
Haunted theories with Shane Dawson— five minutes in it goes to tik tok challenges lmao love that 😂
Funny they think it’s ghost in Colorado when it’s really aliens 👽
i missed you sm
Yay!!!
Shane we miss your conspiracy theories! Like Chuck e cheese aha
I WAS NEVER SUB TO THIS DUDE AND NOW IM????????????? F OFF wtf why im subbed to someone i dont f know
Ok Im made the mistake of watching this at night….
this is lazy
I really hope people don't start going to that bridge because of this.. I live in Aurora, CO and it's no joke
I can't believe there's only one more part after this, I'm going to be so sad when this series is over. I hope you keep doing more spooky content like this in Colorado, it's so good Shane <3
bro no one CARES
Spoopy Shane is back and I’m living for it!
Shane you have no idea how happy I am that you are back! I literally cried! You are so much more than a YouTuber! You bring smiles hope and love to our lives 💕 thank you for being you and we love you!
❤️❤️❤️
PLEASE COLLAB WITH KENDALL
i literally have chills at 5 years old i use to see a man just like the one the youtuber described tall black shadow with a hat and a trench coat. I did some research on it and everything i described has happened before to other people. This man would stay in my hall way but never entered my room and would scare me to the point that i couldnt sleep. He also never had foot steps when he walked through my house i heard like shuffling of his feet like walking through leaves or wearing slippers. Shane i really hope you see this and look into it wouldnt mind explaining further ofc.  love your videos btw happy to see you back
miss this type of videos so much
So so so happy that you are doing these videos again!! Can’t wait for the next one❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yasssss👏👏👏
was this supposed to be scary cause I laughed the whole video
I MISSED YOU
Yay!
im three minutes in and i love this video already. the editing and story telling is on point and i dont want this video to end.
Shane!!!  I  have MISSED YOU!!!!!!  I am so happy your back!!!!!!!!!  This is everything!!!
YYYAAAASSSSSSS
The girl you keep clipping too saying it’s a cowboy spirit from 1800s is just making stuff up. The ghost is a girl in her 20s. She can be seen in a few if her videos. She’s got dark brown hair and looks to have been in a car accident or beaten up. She seems like she just wants Morgan as a friend.
Thank you for including the tale of the Indigenous people of the now-called Colorado area. In US history, Indigenous people are ignored and made invisible but they deserve every right to be seen and treated with respect. I love how Morgan understood that what that white govenor did was awful to the native people of the land and how the video rightfully portrays that action as morally wrong. If anyone cares, knowing the native and un-ceeded land that they live on and supporting those Indigenous communities can help reconcile them against the evil wrongdoings of the white men in power.
jay station vibes
my favorite youtuber is back 😭😭😭😭😭
not them talking about devious licks😭😭
How does Ryland have better skin than Morgan 😭😭😭
So cool, can't wait for the Finale! Creepy times...
I need a dad like rylands one. A whole mood!
I’m so glad you’re back, you saved me <3
Morgan is glowing 😍😍😍so gorgeous even Shane noticed when she walked in the room he was like wow😂❣️
If only he could tone down a bit the eary music and the jump scares, it gets annoying at some point throughout the video.
I'm native. And you documenting this , isnt disrespectful To me.. you're not making fun of it.. Morgan was saying facts..
I'm happy you're back
So glad your back missed this content! ❤
Damn I’ve missed Shane , truly hope he has grown as a person and it isn’t just a facade 💙
The cameraman is so irritating.  He talks too much and tries too hard.  I can’t believe he doesn’t drop the camera because he laughs way too hard and LOUD.  He’s distracting.  Other than Chris I’m loving seeing Shane return.  I also wish the video was longer.
NO.  I HAVE MISSED YOU SR.! 🖤
He’s baaaaackkkk
Love ya Shane
I’m so happy to be watching your videos again :)
Well I’m going to Denver Colorado tomorrow !!! So I’m gonna check this place out
You know how they say if you play a rock song backwards, you'll hear the devil? Well, if you play a country song backwards you get a lovely story about a man whose dog comes back to life and his wife wants him back, and his pick up truck miraculously starts working again.
Grandma is a vibe all on her own. <3 Loving her so much! Ryland's dad too. The whole family is so pleasant to listen to. :) Very humorous. So glad Shanes back man.... truly we needed you Shane.
Love love love love love you! Thank you for being you ♡♡♡♡
Omg Mama Adams came on the ghost hunt I can’t wait to see
My friend came back from third bridge with ice cold hand prints on his car. Colorado is spooky lol.
Fuck the ones who are hating. I’m loving the scary content 🖤💀
I just have to say, Morgan looks absolutely stunning. She keeps getting more and more beautiful. Inside and out. ❤️
This is terrifying
Hello I am happy and glad that you are Shining Light on these atrocities that happened to the Sand Creek Massacre, I am Northern Arapaho and my grandmother is a direct descendant from Sand Creek, she would tell me that stories passed down through time that what happened there wasn't our fault. Let me tell you that once you step foot out there whatever you do Not and I mean DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING that looks Native American craft work. Because it will affect you and your family Ten Fold
MY. FREAKING. QUEEN.
I stan Bruce
lol come to Connecticut if you think that park is crazy… almost every city green is just an old burial site
I’m happy asf rn 🥺 we miss you too Shane!!! F**k the haters , PLEASE STAY!!!!!
I loooove this! And proud of you for being respectful and telling the back story! I hope you keep the spooky coming and I'm so glad you are back!
Morgan is so pretty
Morgan looks so pretty
just a side note IVE ALWAYS had a crush on morgan LIKE SHES SO PRETTY i just wish i was older so i could have a chance (im 17)
This video actually started scaring me lol
Ollie the whole time: 👁👅👁
What’s with Ryan’s Mom She seems bothered  🤔 😕
Woah Im like this is toooo short!!!!! Can’t wait for part 3!
Never been this happy....shanes videos give me life
Is it a dad thing that you have your iPad on the keyboard thing ready to google anything. Because my father i law will spend his dad there with his iPad and glasses on the tip of his nose ready to find answers in google 😂
He used a clip from omargosh and I love that
why did I think Morgan was Tana in the thumbnail
Another creepy Colorado fact, Ted Bundy committed some of his murders there.
Ryland’s family is amazing! I’m so happy that you and Ryland moved closer to them! 🥰
omg i think this has to be one of the scariest videos you made shane  i mean i had chills watching this so glad youer back shane we all missed you
Welcome back Shane. As a Native Canadian and a granddaughter of a residential school survivor. It touches my heart you are talking about the truth of our people. It was never just dark history. It's what happened and today I am still affected by it.
Hate this guy, but honestly, these types of videos he makes brings me some sort of comfort?
glad ur back n doing spooky stuff! my fave! u shoud stick 2 this theme n keep em comin ur gd @ them n conspiracy stuff x ill deffo keep watchin if u do
Ayyyyyyye.... I love Omar and the Fam 🥰
So creepy! I love it!
Where do I sign up to be apart of your family/group bc that’s my DREAM!!!!
Shane uploading makes up for so much stress in my life.  Thank you thank you thank you!❤❤❤
Oh my stars, Rylands dad is my dad's twin I'm sure! Lol
I LOVE MORGAN LMAO she’s so underrated r u kidding 🤍
I laughed when he locked the g wagon in his parents driveway. Idk why I laughed, because I don’t even have a g wagon to lock.
I’m glad that Shane is posting again  Though, this whole thing just feels like a really long drawn out sensationalistic commercial
👻😱💀🎉
Seriously came back late from lunch to see this lol my manager 😠 me 😛
Cheeseman park used to be a potters field, then a park. It was better money to take bits and parts into baby coffins and sometimes things got left behind😬 They find bones a lot there
Part 3 hype!!
I love the annoying orange
This brings me so much joy, glad you are back Shane
Bruce, the icon 2021 needs 💙
We need more of Ryland’s dad. I Stan.
Classic parents. Me : hears a loud house shaking thump on the bedroom floor above me. Dad : That's the house settling. Me : Ehm...
Not on topic of this video but Morgan is so beautiful ✨ Every time the camera was on Morgan I couldn’t help but notice how gorgeous she is
Good Shane Is do amazing his videos helped me with alot
this video hit me hard because i’m from colorado. i’m far from home but i think about it all the time, but im just so happy shane found a home in my home <3 rest in peace to my native ancestors
Yay!!! Please stay!! Don't leave us again.
my principal made an announcement to the school about the vandilation. one kid took the pipes to the urinal off the wall along with a soap dispenser
This is more sad then scary, those poor innocent people, Rest In Peace
from where im from. most schools were cemeteries turned to hospital turned to school
As I’m watching I think of two things. 1. How much Morgan grew up from 2018 to 2021. 2. I forgot this was a YouTube video. Lol.
So spooky I love this!!
k the inclusion of the tick tock challenge stuff was not relevant and distracting to your video, not irronicly funny.
I loved part one but watching this it felt like Shane never left. Great seeing Morgan again too.  Can't wait for part 3 Shane!
Glad to have you back you great human being you.  Love to ryland and your family and may the drama addicts find themselves being silent
Morgan is GORGEOUS just needed to say that and I'm not gay but for Morgan I think I'd try to be lol
It needs to be an hour long sis
not y'all still supporting him, what the fuck?
You'll feel em 🤠👻
Enjoyed this video Shane, glad your back 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️
I love you soo much Shane! I'm so glad that you came back just in time for Halloween which my favorite holiday. I love spooky stories and conspiracy theories so all of this mixed together makes me a very happy girl! 😃
Just in time for spooky season!
Half way through and its been grandma and a dad talking about school days
I’m not sure about the drum beating being dispelled as a pumpjack. I live in Texas and have been near many. They’re almost silent. Only the occasional squeak, they definitely don’t sound like drums being beaten.
I LOVE SHANE DAWSON AMD I FORGIVE YOU AND I HATE ALL THE HATERS AND COMMENTATORS THAT TRY TO PUT YOU DOWN !!!!!!!!
Jump to 10:30 if you wanna skip all the dumb shit
I agree, California (LA specifically) does seem hella toxic lmao.
I kind of don't know about this one. he's diverting the attention too much. if the title wasn't given I would be confused about what the video was about. Also, it feels like he's trying to force some of the scariness of it with music and jump cuts. makes it feel a bit cheesy.
Having Shane uploads again has filled a void in me I didn't know I had! So glad he returned!
Shane Pls next video conspiracy theories
go to goat man’s bridge
Yesssss starting video now!!! So excited!!! Thank you, Shane.😊👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
The grandma is so fucking cute can't stand it
We literally couldn’t stop laughing when Ryland’s dad was talking about the kids destroying bathrooms and when grandma was just sitting on the couch and Shane asks “do you know what they’re talking about?” and she says “no"😂😂😂 we missed your vids Shane and cannot wait to watch this series!!🥺 We hope to entertain people on the scale you do one day. Have an amazing weekend everyone! ❤
Kendall Rae and Shane Dawson having a collab would destroy YouTube
Did that comment say aspiration of a little girl and nobody correct it?? It's apparition. Also, this 3 part haunted whatever is only gonna have 1 video with the haunted whatever? This is dumb.
I was literally in Aurora, Cheesman Park, AND the Botanic Gardens like 4 days ago!!!!!
yess queen is posting again
Love it , can't wait for more :)
Please make as many videos as you can you are my therapy 💕
I said I was gonna go to bed  “Shane uploads”
I appreciate Morgan doing some research to tell this story of the Arapahoe tribe. Burn sage and fan the smoke on yourselves if you feel like one of the spirits followed you back home.
"I think California is pretty toxic." You're not wrong. It's the part of America we just kind of look at and say, "Glad I don't live there."
Can I move to Colorado too! Idaho is even more toxic!!! They are crazy here!
I’m so enjoying this series!!
Funny thing is these kids think it’s funny taking shit off the walls. But for vandalism, you can get up to 4-5 YEARS in prison. Expecally when they’ve already warned kids about it, over PA’s and notes to parents etc etc. like.. it’s expensive as FUCK to supply and run the bathrooms. Sure as fuck their gunna prosecute a bunch of the kids
Shane you are teasing us UGHHH!!  Now I have to wait for the next video!!!
I'm happy anytime I get to see Morgan, so ...
Great video!  I visit cemeteries and communicate with the people who died in the 1800's to early 1900's and you can no longer read their names on the tomb-stones.  Lot's of fascinating experiences!!!
Morgan looks gorgeous 😍
Ryland's grandma is my favorite person ever lmao
morgan is so pretty
What was this
I’m so happy you are back on YouTube I was so happy to hear you was coming back your videos make me laugh and feel better when I’m depressed and your amazing Shane keep up with the good work 😊😊😊🥺🥺🥰🥰
I can't believe you're back! I never stopped loving you btw. 🥺
I CANT WAIT FOR THE FINALE, give it to me now! Lol
Couldn't watch more than 3 mins
I’m sooo happy you’re uploading again!!!
All those avoiding their midterms and instead watching this episode and congregating in the comments 👏👏
Ughh cant wait for the next one!
I AM SO PUMPED FOR THIS MISSED YOU SHANE💕
I officially stan Bruce 😂
I never even knew about the Sand Creek Massacre. Just how many of these went on that hardly anyone knows about? 😰
Who is the camera man?! It doesn’t sound like the same guy as before
I glad Shane  came back and the fact that he didn’t care that was cancelled such a queen 👑
Ok but Morgan it's so beautiful 😳
Shane you wanted us to take you back. Get to the point. 2 vids in now and no ghost hunting
Just wanted to take a moment to say that Morgan looks amazing and so much more confident and comfortable in her own skin. Yes queen!
Me on my half an hour break
Shane's reaction to the backstory: I just wanted to go for the spookies lol I love these videos
“you’ll feel ‘em” IM PEEING OMG
Morgan is hilarious!!! I love her.
morgan is hot
im so happy ur back, ur my literal childhood and you give me so much comfort
Ps DO NOT watch this while high with earbuds on 😭
Im from noco and ive never heard of this place before tbh
WE BACKKKKKK
Welcome back
i LOVE the fact they call making out kikis i love it a lot actually
Idc if he’s problematic IM SO EXCITED
The editing of this video was  *chefs kiss*  ugh obsessed with this series!!!
I am so happy you are back!!!! Now if you want a real scare come visit me in South Jersey and I'll take you to multiple places that will scare the hell out of you!! 😍😍😘😘
Shane! I'm glad your back on youtube. Iove your videos.❤ please don't leave us again lol. Love you.😅🙃
I know Shane was canceled and all but I really did miss his videos and Im so happy he's posting again
Oh Morgan is neurodivergent?
Can someone tell me why Morgan is literally SO FREAKING PRETTY?!
Only watching this for Morgan
LETS GOOOO PART 2
Why was that guys face blurred out?
I’m LIVING for BRUCE😂😂😂🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼❤️❤️❤️
Oh no. He posted again. I can't with this anymore, goodnight.
Bruce is literally my dad. I’m crying laughing rn 😂😂😂
Nothing happened.. again.
🤣 Love the Dad
I love cheeseman Park, I didn't know it was haunted but the 2 times I've been there its so gorgeous
This should be part 1.4 or part 1
4:42 I love how they are like soap dispensers are being ripped off the wall while at my school someone stole a whole toilet
Loved the presentation Morgan. Well done! 😁👍
im just so happy he is back
The guy with the Fork in the pan was the worst part of this whole video
Right on!
Can we talk about how beautiful morgan looks 😍 she looks like shes glowing
Thank god Shane  saved spooky season with this series. All the stories were really interesting. Can’t wait for the next video…I wonder what will happen🤔
I am so happy to see you posting again Shane. I think you are amazing!!! I literally watched your videos during my chemo treatments...they really got me through so much...I was waiting patiently hoping you would return.WELCOME BACK!!!!!!!!! <3 <3
i 100% agree with Rylands dad about those kids destroying everything! Karma needs to come bite them in the ass and hard!!
Yessss Queen!!!
Yall live near a conservation center make a video off it if u can
I love Kendall Rae !! 🤩
I've definitely been ghost hunting all over CO. Been to 3rd bridge multiple times and my main advice would be 1. Make sure you fill up with gas BEFORE you head out there. 2. Cops frequently watch for young people heading out that way. So be careful not to get in trouble. 3. Have fun, get spooked, be respectful!
OMG Shane now that you are back an living here in Colorado, look up Gold Camp Road. Thats here in Colorado Springs and super haunted. Lot's of scary stuff happens there. I have experienced it several times.
The school bathroom thing is unreal … like why is this a trend….
That one dude just casually talking about brutal murders while fidgeting with something
I’m so happy you’re making these videos again😊 I missed you!!!!!
OH MY GOD A KENDALL RAE COLLAB PLEASE
Yessss I’ve been waiting for this 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Edit: I want to adopt or be adopted by Ryland’s family. Grandma is the absolute cutest and everyone’s sense of humor is amazing.   Please go to that creepy park!
Making another dinner for my boyfriend cause he eats late sees Shane posted..WELL sorry babe but you're waiting until I watch every last second.
Colo-RAD-O
YESSSSS I’m so hype
Did she mean to say apparition? not asperation lmfao
MORGAN IS SO BEAUTIFUL 😭❤️
I love rylands grama
Grandma is literally the SWEETEST human.  You got super lucky to marry someone with such an amazing family!
Ryland's parents seem to really respect Shane. The way they came to him about the tik tok stuff. And Shane did highlight it. I love that. They take his work serious. That kind of support is priceless.
I used to live in Arapahoe county (Aurora), and I didn't know about the haunted Third Bridge. I live in El Paso county now. But I have a friend who lives in Aurora, so I'll let her know to avoid Third Bridge.
Shane’s back 🥺😊
How long till Shane convinces Ryland to get a Tesla to detect ghosts in cemeteries
Morgan needs to do true crime/scary videos !!! Who agrees????
Why’s that mans photo blurred?
Used to live in aurora and literally felt like I was always being followed by dead people and I’m not one to believe in paranormal stuff either. Also my grandparents house in lone tree had the creepiest sound in the basement, like an electronic doll or something. I went through the whole storage room multiple times and could never find it.
Has anyone tried taking someone “ghost hunting” that has had one of those near death experiences? Just thinking out loud but, theoretically,  wouldn’t someone that’s already seen the other side be more sensitive to these things? Idk. I don’t actually believe in ghosts but I do believe in a life after death (Either heaven or eternal damnation) and I believe some people have seen the other side and come back.
OMG the legend of Shane Dawson - Its been so long I feel like my grandma use to tell me about him as a kid.
omg almost 2 years and his editing is still on fleek..how
Me, a native americans…  👁👄👁
Was having a bad night. This just made me happy. 😊
Now we know where Morgan gets her humor 😆 Ryland on the other hand takes after their mom 🥰
whenever you posted this we won our last volleyball game so now i get to watch❤️
ok...between the 3 of u guys...someone buy poor grandma some hearing aids
I got sam and Colby vibes from the intro
Im not in school anymore but my school definitely deserved more than a vandalized bathroom. They treated us terribly and denied us our IEP's and 504's. the system is broke. I have been grabbed hard on the arm by the principal to be dress coded. They have even swept illegal strip searched under the rug. They let a kid get away with hitting my car and leaking my phone number bc he would've been kicked off the baseball team if he got in trouble bc of their oath. Ive been denied being able to call my mother during a medical emergency and almost had to go to the hospital bc of my kidneys. I myself who has a learning disability had to help the other kids who were less fortunate than me bc they were denied help and asking many questions. Shout out to the kid that burned down the outside bathroom with fireworks. Dude has mine and the rest of my old classmates respect. They had it coming.
I hate how short these are, I’ve missed you so much omgggg 🥺❤️ when theres only a few min left i get so sad
I love Rylands family so much! 🥺 especially his dad with his joke about the kids getting in trouble for vandalizing the school 😂 can’t wait for the next video!
4:30 yea it's so stupid and childish. Things kids do to get some damn views. Our schools have taken away access to have your phone on you during school hours completely now because for weeks they couldn't get kids to stop the damn TikTok "trends"
rylands dad did indeed NOT like devious licks
I'm so glad shane is back but wow the editing in this video is very hyper sensationalized.
Literally just learned about sand creek in class today, Shane’s timing is unmatched❤️
Nothing happened. Put out the next ep!! I want the scaries.
Rylands dad is such a mood I can not ✋💀🤣🤣🤣
I've been so wrapped up in all the crazy coming upon our nation and world, Shane putting our vids again is the first thing that's been able to fully take my mind off all that, and just relax for a bit! We missed ya Shane!
I miss this 😭  P.s MORGAN YOUR SO PRETTY 😭
Grandma's gonna kick it at home while y'all get terrified. She's like I'm good here 😂😂
Grandma is legend.
Rylands grandma and dad are prob my fav besides Morgan 💜
So cool to see Omar here! I love his channel!
Fuck algebra homework
why do i feel like part 3 is going to be anticlimatic and overly dramatic over someone stepping on a tree branch? am i the only one that sees this being the outcome
I love it , the gang is back 🤣 Shane Family 😝😝😝😝😝😝👻
I love Kendal Rae
Bro people die everywhere all the time it's not that deep
I am so happy I get to be excited again for Shane posting new YT videos .. I’ve been waiting for this so lonnngggggg!! 🖤😆🙌🏼
IM FREAKING OUR BROOO! I STILL CANT COMPREHEND THIS IS HAPPENING
You all look great but I have to say that Morgan looks FABULOUS!!!
what is the song at the beginning called
i love all of you so much ♥
Why would kids destroy bathrooms at school? What were they thinking?🙄
I wanna date Morgan lol but oh my god I missed these vids
we love this!!
Me: Why is this video so short?! Also me: damn it's more than half an hour
I am so 😄you are back!!! ❤️
Please bring Kendal Rae!
Yassssssssss qween!
Great video! So proud of you Shane! Morgan is looking fooiiiinneee too.
Morgan is adorable 🥰
I love how Bruce is like advocating for Cheeseman park haha
We all make mistakes I love these videos
This was amazing! 😊 I can’t wait for the finale!
The statement of the haunting is not to. Hurt anyone like they were it's them protecting there land like they couldn't in life so in death it's still there's that's why they play dirty and fuck up ur cars they weren't into that kinda devolpment to ruining it when it comes on there area is kinda a low key fuck u and ur bullshit leave or we make u one way or the next
Just got an AD for the new Scream movie on a Shane video. I don’t think it can get more ICONIC ❤️
Hi everyone!
Shane definitely deleting comments
Shane: *uploads* ME:
Shane so happy you’re back!! Can’t wait to see the finale!!!
The last part better be long
this video was pointless when the hell is the juicy cemetery robbing??
I missed your videos! Totally has a laugh and was spooked !!!!!!!!!!!
so happy your back shane!!!!<3
i love you shane so glad ur back <3 i miss the times when me and my now ex gf binged all ur videos ...
I love seeing all the stuff about Cheesman Park on here! I'm going on a spirit tour this saturday there!
why does morgan still have a room at moms when she bought the barn
Shane has never been canceled with me. Keep the videos coming!
Bruce is a riot!!!!! 😆 Shane!!!! I’m so happy you’re back! 🥰
Loving the new series Shane! Missed you on YouTube! You should look into the Brown Palace...very haunted place! Plus they have high tea...time to spill the tea I say! 🤪
Omg! I love that Shane is back. I hope he posts more and more. I like seeing the whole group Shane, Ryland, Morgan and the family! They look so much happier there, like the fog and drama faded when they hit the end of the California line... Morgan you are fabulous girl! ❤️😉❤️😉
ugh when is the next episode!!! i can’t wait anymore!!😫
Bruce is carrying this video
Sounds of horses at night, scares me even more in Colorado
I would like to take a moment to admire and appreciate what a great job your new camera friend is doing. He kept the style of your older videos, making it feel like nothing really changed in film style.
Need moreeeee please make these longer! I miss the 2 hours specials lol
I love you guys 💜
Miss Shane mom in his videos
Can confirm California is VERY toxic 😩🙄
Apparition not aspiration.  Anyway...
Hey Shane have always loved u all u make my day better I'm so glad your back you should definitely look up the Victoria Martin's case
I love this and i love you shane but with all respect the music was killing  at the past of the video of the park
not Kendall Rae!!!!!
Why would they build a park on top if a cemetery how disrespectful..the ppl who approved it should be hunted
I'm happy Shane is back! I loved seeing Omar's face so many times!
morgan saying “I feel like kendall rae right now” made me LOL omg love kendall
I haven't finished the whole video yet but I thank you for acknowledging Native Americans!! In whole!!!
Any Indonesians watching this video??
I wish I could like this video 1000x
Is BAAAAAACKKKK!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕😍
What was the point of this episode
"It's dead... like the massacre victims"
I love ryalnds parents Boston terrier
I missed youuuuuuu
Rylands family is EVERYTHING!!! Get his dad a tik tok so he can rage about tik tokers!!!
I live in Aurora, and it's so weird to suddenly recognize the streets and landmarks in the background of the videos
Woo OmarGosh! Lol I love him!
I always laugh watching your videos Shane !😂🤣
That fu’ken pisses me off, omg how can people do that to incident people..!!! I am First Nation, indigenous from Canada 🇨🇦 and there has been so many massacres here as well but it just makes me soooo upset just listening to something like that..!! I guess you can say I’m triggered...! BTW love the video Shane..!!
I'm so invested in this I can't wait for another upload
I love that these vids are back but we also need the OG Conspiracy vids!
Missed you Shane, I'm glad you're making such an awesome series. Just in time for spooky season 🎃
I don't know if this helps but since I'm Native American I prayed to whoever's native American spirits are there to not hurt you and told them you mean no harm. I hope it helps at least a little bit :)
This makes my heart so happy 😊  welcome back
is david dobrik behind the camera
Morgan is glowing
i’ve had a really bad day, this is just what i needed
so happy I had some wine for this lol.       p.s Shane can you please do like a Netflix series on YouTube and put all  the episodes out at once  I hate waiting for you to get your sh#t together and post! love you!
Rylands dad needs to be in many more videos in the future he is too funny 😂
I missed this soooo much!! Also, Ryland’s dad is hilarious. 💙
ohhhboy i wished these were longer :')
I’m here for Morgan :} ya yas girl
Rylands dad is so adamant about these damn Tik toker’s😂💓
You have such a wholesome family and I'm here for it!!
Pls give us longer episodes 😭❤️
i have so many ghost experiences, and my mom has told me A LOT of scary stories that happened around where she lives, i absolutely love listening to them
This got me fuuuuuuuucked up
Going to a native massacre site for views lol still the same shitty person
Its the editing for me
i'm afraid to even talk about my ghost stories, i don't want them to find me :c love you long time<3
Love u Shane so happy ur back xox
I love bruce
Love u Shane so happy ur back💘🥺
I am so proud of you!! 😍
Also alot more fucked up shit happens in LA but those evil people have the money to cover it up. And also the news that circulates around LA they only report about the celebs spotted and their babies and drama and all that bullshit rather then reporting about the important shit. They find it more important to report about the bullshit celebrity's lives rather then the evil shit going on cuz their being paid off to report about those people instead of the important shit.
He’s back and I’m happy. We do grow. We do make amends. Those who have not fucked up (yet) don’t understand and never will. Great content.
Shane I love you so much and am happy you're back
"I'm just a big old man that wants to show the creepy spookies!" 🤣
I am native and heard of the park many times.... Might have ancestors there
Few things:  1. Shane, I am so glad you’re back. You’re one of the reasons I got out of a deep depression back in 2017-2018. I’ll never forget the laughs you brought me. 2. Ryland’s dad is really is cracking me up with how pissed and disgusted he is about the kids destroying schools. 3. Ryland’s grandma & mom are stunning!  4. I’m just so happy right now that this trio is back together.  Life is good. 💜
Part 3 !!!
I can sympathise with Shane having things follow him because it’s been happening to me, too, ever since I was little. I have stories. One involves children’s handprints and another involves an object moving of its own accord. Also I have a story about being on horseback in a cemetery and the horse completely freaking out. Also right now I live next door to a 15 room old mansion that looks like a haunted house and it’s weird because the rest of the neighborhood is lower middle class. Anyhoo, I can relate. :)
Yaaaay! So excited for part 3!
That chicks channel is about to bloowwwww up
Shane post video about ghost  Me: stops my college work due in like 10 mins and watches the video
I get so excited when Shane uploads a new video.  They seriously give me a break from real life issues, and entertain me so much.
Does anyone know the piano music at 24:00?
I love seeing Shane with Ryland’s grandma. It’s so obvious how much he’s missed that type of love, and she’s such a loving lady ❤️ he and Ryan are meant to be
I honestly love the family dynamic so much! I love that they all have something to say and aren’t afraid of saying it! I love these. Especially Morgan and Grandma hahahaha
😍😍
When I heard Shane came back literally was in tears. His content makes me so happy. I can literally watch his videos for hours.
Went to the Denver botanical garden for a family vacation, it was lovely.
I went there a couple weeks ago with my man! He lives in Colorado and I'm in North Carolina about to move there! It was crazy to hear those drums dude!
Another great one 💚💚
Listening to Ryland’s grandma reminded me of a childhood memory of my own; my great grandmother lived in a little house by herself until she went into a nursing home and passed in the early 1980s but I remember that she had two bedrooms; one she used and the other was always closed off. It was fully decorated and everything and was just off the living room but it was always freezing in there and she had central heating and that room always felt heavy to me and as a kid I would only go in there to get something for my grandma and rush right back out.
GOD I MISSED THIS
How did nobody make a "snatched" joke?
The guy licking his dead battery sent me ☠️
I'm glad you're back 😁
This is everything. Rylands Grandma is quite literally everything. Currently watching this I’m the dark because why tf not. So happy seeing you creating again Shane. I LOVE BRUCE HAHA.
Omg Omar!! I love him! Also missed these videos. I know your changing and I can see it
I will always love you. We all have a past and we've all made mistakes.  What makes you strong is you own up to your mistakes and you've grown from them. I can't wait to see what else you put out
Me and my wife don't agree on to many videos but anything that Shane puts out we watch together.
@7:08 Does the dog that Roland's grandma is petting have a heart shape of hair on its head? It looks like it. So cute.
SO EXCITING!!!
OMG!!! it was only for a split second but you put Omar from omargoshtv into the video!!! I love him too!
Me being a dare devil and watching this in the dark..in the basement
You should do Riverdale road in adams County and adams County fair grounds and that lake!... I have had some crazy experiences there!
I LOVE SEEING U BACK 💙🧿 I hope everything is okay .
OK HELLO MORGAN😍😍🔥🔥🔥
I’m the only energy source they can find!?!!? Awww nah baby they better go play with an outlet
This editing is perfect. Shane is very talented. LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! WELCOME BACK!
Shane should make movies. he's amazing at making only videos. imagine the movies he would make guys! he has potential!!
At 8:59 put the speed at 0.25x and you will see a shadow move across a chair in the dinning room.
Rylands dad is so funny, electric cars gonna attack lol, I get where he was goin with that .  My only complaint, episodes are so short! I need at least an hour or more !  I am already excited for the next series. Never leave again!
Thank you Shane for making such amazing content
❤
Morgan had me dying 🤣😭🤣
Morgan is entitled to boundaries around her personal space regardless of who the home belongs to.
Shane I need your help with some advice 💔
Ryland's grandma is such a delight.
there’s no way his ass isn’t deleting comments
Ryland’s dad should write country music! 😂
Creepy spookies 😂😂😂
Can't wait for the next one,  and hopefully many more to come!!
Shane I’ve missed your videos!! THIS IS GIVING ME LIFE!!! Thank you!
All in favor of grandma getting her own channel? 🙌
Love ray dad ❣️❣️
Morgan looks absolutely stunning here....
**pours drink & gets comfy**
Shane, if you ever make a horror movie, can I play a role in it?? 😂👍👍
I've been waiting days for this, I even had to Google MDT time zone cuz I didn't know what time it was 😂 I was still late.
Ok but Rylands Dad is a whole mood 😎👌
Ahhh oh my fuck!!!!! Hes back!!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
29:52 Ryland has a "I know you're trying to fuck my man" look on is face 😬
I don’t care what y’all say, thank god he returned
I just really miss the squad. :<
OMG... This whole family looks FUN and Ryland dad oh my.
Hope Shane keeps doing videos like this ❤️😁❤️

Love you all <3
Wait the annoying orange is back?!
I love Ryland's dad! Heck yeah!
GO FIND THE GHOSTS. !!!QUIT DESTROYING THE BATHROOMS YOU LITTLE SHITS!!!  *Seriously its not funny or cool.
Omar Gosh!!! Love to see your work incorporated❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
WELCOME BACK SHANE I LOVE YOU!!!!
Ok Shane.. you gotta get to work… I’m not ready for this series to be over next week.  I NEED more content from you ASAP!! 🤟🏼👻🖤
My grandma just moved out of the mobile home and when I was staying there it was terrible it was so haunted I couldn’t sleep and always woke up at 3 am feeling like someone or whatever is watching me
Okay I’m here to support Shane but like dude where’s the haunted shit. I’m here for the spooky so where’s the spooky 👻
I love this family
As an indigenous person, really liked that acknowledgment of what happened in those tragic events.   I missed Shane's series!!
If you want to see scary, I went to mortuary school in Denver and we partially did our training at Fairmount Cemetery. Underneath the Masoleum is nightmare fuel with the old basement and unused prep rooms. Pretty cool and terrifying altogether to see history like that.
I cant with Morgan's beauty!! Sis, give me someeee
I recently moved into this house (been here for 8 months)  where 5 years before a girl was brutally murdered with a hatchet by her bf and he stuffed her body under the porch, i just found this out not too long ago.... ive been having weird thing happen like i have tape over my light switch so the only way to turn on the light is to pull the string.... one night at like 1am i was falling asleep and something pulled on the string turning on my light.... i was a little freaked out but turned it back off and fell asleep, than one day i was home alone and doing laundry in the garage and i heard walking around in the kitchen... i did start to get freaked out but tried to shrug it off,  night i was watching anime and eating and i go to look up at my door and see a white human shape mist literally walking out through the door.. my heart dropped and i was in shock and my eyes got teary but after that i havent had anything really happen but sometimes ill be gaming and ill feel a brush of FREEZING cold air and my body will feel heavy and limp and ill feel light headed like something went through me and ive had a dream where i was in this house pitch black and something is crawling around the house... i really Fing hate living here but also love it?? Im so into ghost and spooky things.
I’ve fuckin missed you Shane❤️
Welcome home, baby❤️
I love how small the world is, I used to go here in high school with all my friends.
Gimmie gimmie more gimmie more gimmie gimmie more
Just a few points of constructive criticism for your editor:  - Tone down the volume of the music, it's on the verge of being earr4p3 - Tone down the amount of clips, especially recycling the same clips over again from your previous videos  I know you want to do longform content for the algorithm, but this video could have been cut down like 10-15 minutes if it wasn't so redundant.
My boy is back and i am so happy! I hope he makes good choices and keeps blessing us with great content.

ughhhhh Morgan, come to the gay side! You're gorgeous and so funny!
The Kendall Rae reference ❤️
So glad you are back Shane! 🖤🧡🖤

Ok but Morgan is so gorgeous!!!! Ugh I lovvvvvve that Shane is back !! I count the days till the next video is up 😩😍🎉
No more fillers Morgan 💔
Morgan coming in and saving the day after that very scary edit
I’m loving this content. What a comeback!!! I can’t wait for the finale and then to see what’s next. Whatever it is, I know it will be great! ❤️
Forgot how much I missed Shane
hiiiiyaaa love u glad ur back can i politely request that we chillski on the background music or just like turn it down a little especially when theres a lot of other talking going on or information being shared it makes it really difficult to follow ok thx love u byeeee
Your videos give me something to look forward too ♥️
This is so gooddddd im actually feeling the suspense. Im looking forward to the last part. Welcome back again Shane! u did a good job battling ur inner demons , coming back and  making a new series of vids. I hope this is for good cause we really miss u and love u.
Glad you’re back Shane!
"I hope I don't die!" "heh, yeah..."
It's nice to see Shane actually getting out more and doing things instead of hiding in the house all the time. 🥰
You really should make horror movies.. You really know have a talent Shane!!!! This is before I’m even seeing this video.. the beginning is perfect
Im saying this as a native, you don't want an angry native spirit coming after you. Please becareful!
risking the nightmares to watch this before bed
It’s 3 am. I can’t sleep… LETS GO!
Loving part 2 Shane!! Please tell me you’ve watched Destination Fear on the Travel Channel?! They go to places like this and spend the night. Some episodes are sooo scary!!
POV: You are hiding in the comments
Not gonna lie shane deserves a shorty awards for such great vids
Yes queen!!! Love it Shane!! So glad you are back ❤️❤️
Come to Greeley Colorado 😭😂
Love the video but turn down da music please can’t hear shit
This was pretty creepy.
I always forget that there’s a good chance not everyone who watches Shane has been watching Ryland and Morgan over the last couple years. When he introduced rylands childhood home, I was like yes. We have been here.
*Grabs Diet Coke and snacks*. LLLLLEEEEETTTTSSS GGGGGGOOOOOOO!!!!
Uhm hello skinny legend 💁🏼‍♀️
The next episode better be at least an hour!
Damn he really keeps teasing us and didn’t bring us the spooky vibes in this one
have to agree with him...California  is toxic for SO many reasons..tell him to give black and white doggy love to
*Damn Morgan* 0:40😍
😂 no one in co is unaware of what cheeseman park contains
In the beginning I thought I was watching another paranormal activity movie
I get so happy for these notifications !!
Bruce is king for sure. I love rylands family and Shane's momma. So proud of you shane
Please the devious lick part was so dramatic
Hi y'all
IDK but I never liked rylands mom.
I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!
Shane returned to YouTube right when my life started to feel dark again. I’m so happy to see him getting back to what he loves. We missed you queen thanks for cheering us up with your videos
seriously really super duper enjoying you being back to yourself and letting your personality shine again, Shane ❤❤🌈💪🤗
so happy you posted!
:)
SO thrilled to have Shane back
ugh.. i cannot wait for the finale!!! Shane you really do know how to keep an audience. I am so glad you are Back in Action!!! I cant wait to see what you have in store this year for us... i hope it feels good to be back because it is so nice to have u back!!!!
Morgan would be great doing Kendall Rae type videos I love listening to her
OMAR GOSH. i love that you included him 🥲
Thanks for recognizing the past of our Indigenous people in this video.

I have missed you so much!!
You already know your gonna have a good time when you see Morgan ryland and Shane in the thumbnail😄😁

So did people just forget the horrible things Shane did or what???
Shane having regrets shows how scary Third Bridge really is...
We miss you  Shane!!
Filler episode
Yikes
Third bridge ?? Lol here in Marshalltown iowa we have whats called 3 bridges. Coincidence? Military conspiracy?
YESS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS :)
Sad there wasn’t much ghost hunting on this one
Morgan looking THICCC in the beginning of the video !!!
I didn’t expect another upload this early but I am so fucking excited holy shit 😬
Stop rylands dad screams Republican😭
Poor native people ;-;
i literally just did a presentation about sand creek. and i grew up around there for a hot minute
yessssssssssss!
YES!!! My favorite YouTuber and his family doing paranormal things now!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!! 👻👻👻
That Boston Terrier is hysterical!
Love to hear grandma talking. She doesn't say too much, usually.  So, when she talks, everybody listens.  And she never disappoints, either. THAT is wisdom.
Shane your Pond Lake is lovely!
Im watching this at 3 am, SHIT!
You down bad for not going yet :( I can't wait for part three!!
Ryland and Morgan's family is absolutely adorable
You have me hanging on for this one 😱
Okay, I lived in Colorado almost my entire life and how did I not know the dark history of Cheesman Park? 😳
Lmao house settling noices!! Thats what i always tell myself. One thing my mom told me was "the whole world is a cemetery" and that stuck with me in a sense to not be afraid of ghost and that ghost are people too! 😁
Love you all!!
They should go to riverdale road. It’s haunted af
Where is part 2
Shane 🥲 we missed you!!
Now that you’re in Colorado, check put Gold Camp Road!!! Don’t be scared of the ghosts, just be scared of the hobos!
Me: okay I'll finish my school works now  *sees Shane's upload*  Me: nahhh it can wait. I'll watch this first
why are his fonts always so ugly T_T
The Spooky boy is back and we are all here for it!!!!!
That LAST SCARE at 34:51 😳 ☠💀 Damn, I missed this Shane!
So glad to see Shane back Just in time for Spooky season!!
How tf is Morgan still single?? She's so lovely and beautiful.
This videos crazy two of my best friends dyed in that car crash Morgan was talking about in 2016 if you guys ever do go there be careful because some times it gets really foggy at night and the road is like a roller coaster with crazy hills so don’t drive fast RIP Levi and Angelo Andazola
1:40 American imperialism amiright?
i mean morgan should hit me up. i will treat her billion times better then anyone else.
Amazing!!!
These videos need to be longer! 30 mins felt like 10!
NO WAY SHANE POSTED. IM CRYING.
Ive missed shane and these videos cant wait till part 3 ❤️😁
Haunting theory * look at video in notification time says 34:56 click video time says 34:55
Let’s goooo!!!!!!!
Roland's dad is the best😂
Poopy poopy fart fart booty cheeks
Shane!!!!!!! So happy you're back!!!!!!! You made me 💩 my pants. Hahahahaha. Have missed you!!!!!!!!!
OMAR HI OMG🥺🥺
Starting to enjoy this spooky series.
Shane you need to go to River Dale road. It's right by Denver! I had the CRAZIEST paranormal experience. Make sure you do research first to see what you're getting yourself into.
Ryland's grandma and the rest of us: 33:00 💕
Why is no one talking about how pretty morgan looks tho, but so glad shanes back
I was so excited to see a Shane Dawson video uploaded, made my day. 😸😸😸
Shanes back..and im here for it.
Omg yes get Kendall Rae 😍
omg.. ya'll didn't just include Omar in this... *sighs*
I thought u were canceled
Finally done after a busy work day you got my view Shane 👻🖤
Shane I missed you so much thank you for coming back. I really needed you 💕
Well that’s time out of my life I’ll never get back, all y’all did was tell a shitty ghost story, this literally could have been 10 minutes long. Gotta milk it for the “Documentary” and make that $$$ I guess lmao!
omg i am literally so happy you are uploading again, i've missed you sm shane. i always rewatch your old videos to cheer me up, im literally watching this video in my fourth period because my science teacher is bOrINg.. anyways, keep up the good work and keep making people happy, please do not stop uploading, me and my family loves your videos. <3333
I love how honest rylands dad is. He just threw the entire state of California under the bus.😂
Love you Shane! So Happy your back... Oh lord please have a Halloween Special!!! Morgan you look so pretty.
ok, but in Europe it is so common to build parks on old cementaries, especially in countries where its borders changed over the centuries. it's just so funny seeing the dramatic editing while it's normal here 😆
Is Shane going to be on nuke's top 5 videos now? Nice.
pov: it’s nearly 3am but you realised shane posted another video so your gona watch it and get scared at 3am
I am so happy your making videos again!!!!
Omg I LOVE GRANDMA
So glad that you're enjoying family... :)
Morgan is so pretty
Everytime you upload I always feel excitement, it never went away ♥ Thanks for staying Shane ☻
Gosh I haven't been to 3rd Bridge or Cheesman park in years. It's great to have you back Shane. The news clips and back story were so well done.
I'm glad you're uploading again, don't let negativity discourage you from doing what you love to do. Your fans will always be here to watch your haunted videos or conspiracy videos. Those were always my favorite <3
Did yall just completely forget why he was cancelled-
Bro wtf I lived in Denver for two years and I would do yoga at cheesman park, I had no idea it used to be a cemetery 😭
Bruh im so happy he's back 😭 been too long
A lotta bugs out there?!? Your Gs windshield is ripped.  If you're going to drive THAT vehicle around THERE.. It had better be clean
I don't want Shane's series to ever end I'm so happy your back Shane
all snuggled up in my warm bed watching this
ok but Bruce speaks straight facts! lol
😊😊😊😊😘😊😊😊😊👍💖💖💖💖💖Shane.
welcome back shane, missed u king
Colorado native here. There’s a place in Pueblo county called the Honor Farm. It’s been demolished, however a lot of people ghost hunt there. And there has been a horror film made about it. Pueblo is known for being kind of a crappy place in Colorado, but there’s a lot of rich history there from the Steele Mill, to the Meat Factory, the state hospital, and the honor farm. There was also a massive flood that wiped out most of the town, and secret tunnels underground.
Shaneee !! I missed you soooo freaking much ! I’m so happy your back 🎃 👻
Glad you're back man 🙏🏽
20mil subs still ? I'm shocked . You would think somebody who got cancelled that bad wouldn't have even a fraction of this
Rylands dad is the main character
Morgan, “there’s a front seat middle seat and back!” 😂
These videos are like when you an your best friend see eachother for the first time in years😭😭 damnit Shane, I missed you😭😭
I love grandma so much! She seems clueless but she just keeps it real  Also - I love how Morgan put out a picture of her and cookie in the family room
My step dad jokingly told me he would haunt me when he passed,then died unexpectedly and he definitely did i never question the paranormal anymore...i only wish we had cameras to catch what happened..i was ready to move and wouldnt talk about it inside the house for years .. My cats saw it too which made it even more scary 😭
Look into Wyoming 🙃
Cooking dinner watching this
I felt like I was struggling to breathe after this video
I am so happy you are back. You are one of the only youtubers with actually funny dark humor and charisma and I am so glad you decided to come back for us,  the ones who believe in you. Seeing ur growth from neon yellow backgrounds to this is why I respect you, your editing and stories have done nothing but improve sir. You have people with you Shane!!
misses your content !!
Shaaaane you have no idea how much I’ve missed these videos I haven’t laughed this hard in such a long time! I needed this 😂
I’m wondering if the “I’ve missed you” is a hint to the movie you’re writing? 👻👀
Loving all of Bruce’s comments!
Shane, I love you💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I love OmarGosh!!!
im high and watching a scary Shane video, it's like I'm back in hs
i'm so happy you are back shane,  i've missed you !!!!
Chris laugh reminds me of andew’s 😂
It’s been a busy week, so I’ve been looking forwards to it! 🥰👻 The Frenchie is so cute! 😍
One day I'll be as fearless as that man licking the battery!😂👌 #goals
I love the Kendall Rae shoutout! By far one of my favorite youtubers!
Been waiting for another video!!!!!
Shane day! Yay!
Staatsangehörigkeit ÖSTERREICH
SHANE YOU'RE BACK! IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCHHHHH!!!!!!
Lol ryland’s dad was a whole as mood
At my sons high school in Brighton, the kids lit the bathroom on fire
We don’t want you.
Staatsangehörigkeit DEUTSCH
Idc I still and will always love Shane
Shane uploads:  Me: OMG I NEED TO FORGET ABOUT WHAT IM DOING AND WATCH THIS ASAP
❤️❤️
Omg I love Ryland’s Dad!! ❤️
Someone buy grandma some good hearing aid PLEASE?!
This video was literally pointless
I am STOKED! I sooo needed this today. Too much insanity happening rn. Yay! Shaaane!!!
Shane uploads:   Me: runs around the house screaming “SHANE UPLOADED”🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♀️
Shane we missed you sooooo much!!! Your videos are my safe space 💗 Im glad you’re doing better
My dad is native and his family grew up in fear of the what ifs. So they started to identify as white. My dad still does and he's a dark skin I asked why bc he nor anyone else on his side looks white my great grandma ×4 was a servant and took on her owners name and race. So ya racial identity is harder for older generations
The last six months have been the literal worst of my life. Struggling so freaking hard, just to survive with winter coming, and just so much overwhelming stuff collapsing me all at once. And this series is such a wonderful thing to come into my life when I needed it most. Shane, you have never failed to put a smile on my face, and I love your content and how no matter what happens, you fight back and stay true to yourself. You give me hope that I can get through this difficult time, and I want to thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I can't wait to see the next one. 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Morgan looks perfect love that
So happy to see you doing something about my home state and even happier to see that you're back! I can confirm that 3rd bridge is where the teens go to get spooked. Please be careful, it's super dark out there. Also, please take caution when visiting Cheesman park at night, back when I was still living there it was a high crime area. Side note, y'all heard of riverdale road?
can we admire how pretty morgan looks <3
Wow. This was so shockingly boring. Seems like the only necessary episode is the last one. Didn't need to be a series. Just make one good video instead of a series of mediocre ones.
“Do you know what they are talking about grandma?”  Grandma: “No”  😂 she is precious
Man just licks a battery and casually says “dead just like the victims of the massacre “😂😂😂
ok, I so happy and excited to see you back Shane and the grew. i don't want to sound saying this or be rude to your new videographer, just the camera is so shaky. I'm not trying to be mean, just wanted to give some feedback. I don't know if you can try. to stabilise the camera or whatever. just I think it would make a difference.  love you Shane
PLS WHY DID HE MAKE THE DEVIOUS LICK TREND SO INTENSE
shane uploading cured my depression
I am so happy you're back!! 🥰🥰🥰
Hands down this is going to be a hella awesomener then Mindseed TV!!!
So weird hearing local spots in a YouTube video. Please don’t ruin them for me 😭
Did you put in the man with the hat at 31:36....
happy ur back!
I am living for Ryland's family. Can they please adopt me?
Soooooooooo happy to see you posting again, please never stop creating ❤️
I love that y’all moved to Colorado…the vibe there is so much calmer and y’all seem so much happier! Plus I got to say I love Ryland’s family…they are so sweet! Sending love and good vibes your way ♥️
Omg!!! Waiting for these videos feels like old time!! Missed Ya bunch Shane!!!
literally have been waiting forever i love u shane no matter whatttt <33
I mean Shane does have some content creating talent, you can’t deny that, let him do his thing already
The only critique I have is that majority of this video was news clippings. The clips are helpful but too many of them gets annoying.
This is so whack
I love all ya'll. Littttttterrrrally makes my whole day and week! We love the content ❤❤❤
Bye bc I have a trip to Colorado soon and definitely could have been better not knowing that some parts I was looking forward to have literal bodies under them 😭😭
Literally can NOT handle him only once a week. Like i miss shaaaane and need the ghost tours more. The laughs and love is everything.
Everytime they said cheesman park all I heard was chisme lol
I always love hearing from Grandma! She is so sweet.  Dad and mom make my day and always put a smile on my face...you are all so very lucky.. I hope, one day I will be as lucky, blessed and happy as you all!!  Life has been the worst and it scares me..I am Sad
The amount of times I’ve been dummy wasted at cheesman park and had no idea 👁👄👁
That was amazing well done shane! 😃😊💙🖤💜💕💞
The new camera guy is a little cringe
These videos have documentary music but reality TV content, cant believe it hasn't been picked up by TLC yet
I’m SO excited for your new series. Don’t let us down Shane. We’re all rooting for you. ♥️
The little kids crying in the woods thing could be bobcats, they can sound crazy when they cry and are often mistaken for babies,kids even women’s crying/screaming
Rylands parents do seem like the type to knock while they enter lol respect morgan a lil more shes an adult now cmon
I definitely learned about the specific Native American story they were talking about in school obviously bc it’s apart of history but that’s so crazy
Ugh... I've missed this
Im soooo happy your back!! Also can you PLEASE visit Jak haunted museum in las vegas. I am not sure if you hear: of it, but Jak collects actual artifacts from murder houses, things used in ritual or haunted houses. Also the museum its in, the basement was used to do satanic rituals. Apparently its the real deal...but idk it might be too much 😅
Dying at the guy who tested the battery with his tongue 🤣 those clips
I have to say I am so happy Shane is back. Is it too much to ask to have a daily hour or two long video? To see the twinkle back in his eyes, makes me happy for him❤️❤️
why is no one talking abt how STUNNING morgan looks
I love the editing
SHANE WE MISSED YOU TOO
Morgan is so beautiful!!!!!!
I love looking forward to your videos again ☺️we’ve missed you! Can’t wait for part 3!
So happy Shane’s back! So sick of drama! He’s a creative man who deserves to continue to be creative! I am and always will be a fan, n invested! Can’t wait for part 3!!!!
i am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY your back!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shane the editing with the guy explaining third bridge where you keep pausing the dramatic music SENT ME.
This just makes me too happy… Shane never leave us again !!!! ❤️❤️❤️😭😭
SHANE 💖
I'm absolutely LIVING for this series!!! Im so glad to have you back Shane 🎃 P.S When those new hoodies dropping 🎃🎃🎃🎃
I’m sorry, I love Ry & Morgan’s dad! He’s like the dads where I come from…jus sayin.🥰✌🏼
My husand who is a custodian to a high school, this tik tok trend is a serious issue and dad Adams has the right idea #eastcoast
"Did you know that the annoying orange is back?" Morgan 2021 😂😂😂😂😂😂
👁👁
Rylands dad calling the kids “little shits” while the mom was telling to it say that was funny asl.
"Oh its dead.... like the massacre victims..." 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that guy was so funny
I'm loving the fact I can now have a Shane Dawson video to look forward to watching every week 😍😍😍 just wish it was a 40 part series not a 3 😭😭
Shane thank you so much for being respectful for all the Native American lives that were lost. It’s means a lot. Love you♡︎
love u queen
There was no signal out there and girls would make out with us when they were more scared...... *Dennis Reynolds comes in* ".....Because of the implication"
They've all grown so much as people and the amount of happiness you can tell they're in is astounding I'm so glad they're finally finding the things that makes them really happy and I'm so glad he's posting again! <3
“Ghost, Demons, me.” I love Ryland so much!
LOVE THIS!
Darn rylands dad comin in with the truth!
i'm so happy ur back i love ur videos shane <333
Shane I'm so glad you're back. This has been a great series so far. I'm excited for the finale! You definitely saved the best for last I can feel it. Welcome back Shane, we missed you too!
Not Morgan looking SNATCHED af 💃🏻
That was awesome can’t wait to see more !!!! Rylands family is adorable!
Grandma is such a little sweetheart. 🥺
I am so so happy and grateful you as yourself are back. I have missed you, your videos, your true inspiration, creativity and love.   I hope the videos get longer then these last 2 because I know there could and wished there would be more of the adventure with the history/information about the area over the video more..I was really looking forward to more of the adventure verses the sit downs.. Again please know this is all from my heart and with love..the first 2 videos should have been put together or not as far apart..I found myself getting board... Again, this is all with love ❤
As an Indigenous person I applaud you shane. I hope one day more influencers will share more of our truths. As a Canadian, our history is also so very tragic.
Yeah whoever started that tearing up the bathroom trend in schools has royally pissed me off! My daughter is in 4th grade and can't even go to the damn bathroom unless she's escorted by a teacher and that's complete b******* to me that my daughter can't even go to the bathroom when she wants on her own time!!
The laugh behind the camera I just can’t 😩 it’s like forced, fake and sounds like hyperventilating. It’s awful. SO hard to focus. 33:15 like wow
I think "3" and "part" are supposed to be hyphenated Because it's an adjective
“She would not hear them coming” I laughed so hard.
Morgan is so beautiful, i couldn't stop looking at her. Glad you are back Shane, i missed you and your family,you made my day 💗
Kids destroying school bathrooms was a thing before tick tock ..sorry to burst the bubble of ' all social media is super duper evil'  PS. I don't have tick tock I don't get it maybe I'm too old and I should get off the net 🤷🏻‍♀️
My mother is from Aurora, CO. Everything that people say about that place is true. She’s experienced it herself 🥴. It’s very spooky and she’s told me so many stories about it
Can't wait for the finale. Glad you're back Shane. We need you.
The camera man laugh is so ugly
no but like, the fact that it’s HIGHSCHOOL kids doing this shit. do they not realize THEY will have to pay for shit to be replaced and can get arrested
The drums are called hand drums and pow wow drums. To describe the beat, it’s pow wow music or even ceremonial music. Not “Native American war beats” or even “Native American drums” 😅 but I’m just here to educate from my point of view :)
What an incredibly lovely family…I thoroughly enjoy watching you guys, it really makes my day🥰
I’m a direct descendant of survivors of Sand Creek Massacre, Arthur and Ellen Brady(Cheyenne). My grandfather is Steve Brady Sr.(Northern Cheyenne), the one who was presenting in the Sand Creek Massacre video. He was a leading role in the formation of the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site which opened in 2007. He was a fluent Cheyenne speaker and a traditional leader with an inherent responsibility to protect and preserve the Cheyenne way of life. This year marks 157 years since the Sand Creek Massacre.
even tho shane got cancelled i will forever love him and love his work he puts into his videos <333 everyone still loves u shane dont give up
The dog was my fav part , a Boston terrier? I have two , they’re the best breed
I'm so glad you're back. With every commentary video I see pop up I get worried, I hope I'm not the only one. We missed you!
horror stories with history 🙏
I’ve actually been to third bridge in high school! It is so fucking scary!!! I’ve heard the drums!
Listen old man. How many times do we need to teach you a lesson?
RETURRNNN YESSS
Omg, my mom always did that “knock and open at the same time” combo, too! It was so stressful
This is the best! I missed you Shane!!!!! 🥰
Kendall raes so good but also Eleanor neale!!! She’s so good as well as Kendall ❤️
Morgan is so beautiful ❤️
Best thing I’ve seen on YouTube in a loooooong time !!
Says that they’re not making light of it then proceeds to laugh at the whole situation 😐
OMG Shane said my name badkarma
Me being on fall break not thinking about work and the four bathrooms that have gotten destroyed at my school by students in the last two months 🤦🏼‍♀️😐
We need the finale TMR ASAP
Omg grandma is so funny
PRAYERS UP FOR OUR INDIGENOUS ANCESTORS THAT WERE VICTIMS OF THE SAND CREEK MASSACRE  🙌🏽♥️
Shane X Mindseed 📺👻
ok??? so morgan has always been beautiful???? but somehow glo-d up from a glo up??? she's impossibly gorgeous in this like. the black turtleneck/red lips/blonde curls aesthetic what a LOOK. WHAT A VIBE. DAMN. when chris was setting the shot at 17:10 my heart stopped
As someone who lives like an hour and a half from here, its all true.
i have to say, i really missed you shane, and morgan is gorgeous.  :)
Seeing my girl Kendall Rae made me so happy!! 😍
can't wait for the next one
missed you Shane love both ur channels you and Ryland always watch them don't listen to those haters u guys r the best I love hearing stories and secrets lol I wish someone would go with me to haunted place that be cool
Australia had a "white a**hole" problem too.
Shane and Kendall Rae collab please 🙏
Couldn’t hear any drum beat over all the talking
Morgan: You are more likely to get murdered here.  Shane: cOOOL....
Shane /Ryland & Kendall / Josh mashup video let’s go!
I MISSED THIS!
Vickie is lookin HOT 🥵
Grandma literally had me absolutely snort laughing at her comments! She's so amazing. And I'm so glad to see Shane posting again.
yes slay queen!! map pride!! 🧸✨
Rylands dads anger over the bathrooms, an absolute legend. Truly love this man
SO happy you’re uploading again shane!!
Oh how I missed these spooky vids
I love rylands Dad, he is everything, and I love you guys live there now!!!!!!
I been counting the days and months waiting for your return, Shane. Happy for your new found happiness. Also, Morgan, you are great. An inspiration 🙌
morgan looks so amazing!! i’m so glad to see her!
I want Morgan to do more history telling and spooky vids, I like how she narrates things.
love how people still coming after Shane like bro stop 😐
Shane being horrified about scalping, while actually scalping us with this comeback 🔥
Uh, just here because Morgan looks incredible.
I LOVE this
“Ghost, Demonds, me?” 🤣🤣🤣🖤🖤🖤
I can’t wait to watch the final one . Ugggggh make longer videos  so it won’t end so soon 😩🥰😂
Lmao! Morgan's story about her mom knocking at 8:08 reminds me so much of my childhood when I watched an episode of The Fairly Odd Parents and Timmy's dad was like "I'm both respecting your privacy by knocking but asserting my authority as your father by coming in anyway." I found that line hilarious cuz it's so true xD  Love seeing the family interact. Glad you're back shane!
i like that shanes back but i don't like video editing too many cuts and shifts
they built a park over a cemetery here in chicago too! same thing where they didn’t move everyone and just built over their graves
Ok but like rylands dad is so into what’s going on he went Wikipedia on all of us 💪😭 he needs a channel like NOW 😌
Morgan looks amazing, I feel she went through late puberty and now she just all glowned up
I wanted to see the ghost huntttttttt! ☹️
"She can't hear them coming "  OMG I love this!! Please don't stop after 3!!
Ryland's dad is a SAVAGE LMAO I LOVE IT 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Bruce reminds me so much of my grandpa lmaooo
We need to protect grandma at all costs
😂🤣 every Coloradans thought on California but Rylands dad put it nicely 😂
I feel like Shane is playing it a little bit safe. Almost like he didn’t want to put his whole self into something if we were just going to hate on it/him. Hopefully he sees we still love him😭💛💛💛💛💛
As someone who lives around Denver, I can confirm Cheeseman Park is really friggin' creepy.
Morgan is so freaking pretty
The trailer for the finale is EVERYBLING! So hyped for Part 3!
I am in support of this and I love it, but this doesn’t feel like a series. It’s more of an hour and a half video cut into 3 videos. I would watch a full 2 hour video if you put it out!
I'm loving and living for this new era of Shane. I missed him
My favorite people!!! SHANE!! Morgan, grandma!!!!!!!!!! Love it u did an AMAZING job Shane couldn’t love it more
Loving the new uploads. And Morgan looks GORGEOUS!!!
I love when haters come here and spam the commenters hateful words just bc they’re looking for something to watch. I didn’t accept what Shane did in the past but I accepted his apology. He makes good videos and I respect him as an amazing editor to draw his viewers in it’s always entertaining to watch him no matter what your opinion of him is. The haters here just have too much time on their hands and comment hate but yet they’re supporting him by clicking on his video and commenting on anything will support him so idk why y’all haters are here if you haters wanna reply to me go ahead I’d love to see what you wanna say or be silently mad at me behind your screen I’m sure you got nothing else better to do in your free time <3
Bruce is a mood. LOL
Rylands dad got really into this lmao
I loveeeee that your back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can’t wait for the next part, also grandma is a queen 👑
I wanna see Trinity get in on these too.
Why is this predator trending?
I don’t claim any energy from this video
“i was in science class and my penis caught on fire” !!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can’t stop admiring Morgan 🥺 she’s so damn gorgeous!!!!
Let me join in ur crew bro
Omgsh this is the most ive heard  rylands dad talk and hes a whole vibe😎i love him he's so funny. He's a great dad and his dad jokes are on point btw I get what he meant with the new country songs 😉
Shane! Why do I gotta wait a WEEK to see Part 2?
That's so horrible that all those people never got a peaceful final resting place and that so many of them were mutilated and spread into different cemeteries
I love how the first shot getting into it is jus Morgan lookin thick asfff 🤣😂😂
OMG SHANE IS BACKKKKK IM SO HAPPY!! GLAD TO SEE YOU AND RYLAND ARE DOING OKAY!! IVE BEEN SEEING YOUR INSTA POSTS WAITING FOR THIS!!
Ooooh girl ! That was good. Great build up….I can’t wait  Rylands family it’s like everything haha love them
16:09 sounds like a ghost said Austin. It sounded female.
Omg I was so excited when I saw Omargosh in the video! I love watching his stuff!
OMG why can't these vlogs be hours long. Now I'm gonna have to go back and watch the queen Mary vlogs
Ugh love that youre back shane. Also why did the tiktok bathroom montage make me laugh out loud? 😳 lol oh well
Loove the series and can’t wait for the finale…but also I will be sad 😢 when it’s over
look im here for this idc- <3
I’ve missed you all so much! Please come back more often Shane!
Why am I not getting notified. Y’all may have cancelled Shane, but I didn’t. I clicked the bell so I want my notification, YouTube.
Shane, I am a spiritual sensitive and i breakout in a stress psioriasis fit on my elbows when im spiritually heightened.... Just an fyi
Nearly 35 minutes of other people's content padded with irrelevant vlog moments. This has to be a joke right? Why would Shane come back with this? He must take all his followers for fools if he thinks this is up to snuff.
does anyone see this?? 9:54 what the actual fuck is that behind Shane's head???
Hi Shane! Iʻm glad youre back, a bit of advice- The background b roll sound effects are a bit distracting and loud. Had to re watch multiple times. Just advice! Love the video.
Bitch Aurora in general is just the worst place to drive, the worst place to be in, and it’s literally where my Mom’s uncle lives and we thought he’d be legit dead by now, but he surpassed my Dad with brain cancer so 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Thank you for staying Shane. 💖 I can’t believe we get to say that we have a new Shane series to watch. I’m so insanely proud of how far you’ve come to get to this point!
Thank you so much for this!! 🤗🤗
Thank you for coming back.  You help my heart happy.
Shane I'm just putting this comment here because I think if you are needing more spooky inspiration Colorado Springs is the place to be honey!! Gold Camp Rd. I've heard is the most insane place for ghosts etc. I'd check it out if I were you 😉 love love love having you back!
Love you Shane. Glad you guys are back!
Im so happy he’s back I missed his videos so much
Damn Shane must have cancel culture ptsd with all the no disrespect disclaimers added lol
I missed you Shane<3
Shane should come down to Colorado Springs, Gold Camp, Old stage, Manitou Springs and the other creepy shit here.
The way the grandma said she was happy Shane was doing YouTube again made my heart melt 😫❤️
YES.
God you always deliver the best content
Same bs
Rylands family are just icons
The likes will always outweigh the dislikes. Obsessors, give up.
YES SHANE KEEP MAKING MORE
Mogan got so pretty
Ryland's dad's comments on the school destruction were everything!!!!!
I would do everything to Morgan
I appreciate Shane’s empathy towards everything and everyone. It shows how much he’s grown as a person
Wait..What?? Next chapter soon, please
Shane I love you and I love this series and I’m so glad your happy where u are in life…. Have a good trip lol
I’m from Colorado and I literally can’t explain how happy it makes me feel to see Shane just glowing in such a beautiful place!!
Grandma looks like she’s fighting her own demons 😔 she be sitting there half dead
Thank you Shane for giving my life meaning again. Now please never leave again! ❤
This video just made me appreciate how wholesome grandma is ♥️
I’ve been waiting for this all week.. thank you Shane xxx
Can we please get new Shane merch that says "What what?.....Family"
Grandma would scare all the ghosts away, just watch her
Ep 2 baby I bloody missed you Shane!
The fact that the chief flew the American flag AND a truce flag to try to stop the massacre and they were just IGNORED. So sick. So sad.
Shane im literally crying omg YOUR BACK! and with what a comeback! Shane ive missed you an im so gald to see you back on Youtube!
Dammit I wanted to see it nowwww😭
Fact: the aboriginals or Native Americans never did any scalping it was the white man that framed the aborigines to make them look bad. Very tragic. I’m from Canada and settlers from Europe and the Roman Catholic Church built school to house the aboriginals mainly children. They took by force kids from their home and killed, abused and neglected thousands and thousands of innocent children to wipe them of their culture to make them act white. These school were called residential school. It makes me sad that this happened. Breaks my heart 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡💛
I 'm subscribed to Ryland's channel so i have been watching the move and the new house. I was just wondering where is Shane's Mom?
"youre doing amazing sweetie"🤣<3
Thank you for never giving up Shane. Been here since the Shanna Malcom Days ❤️
I've missed you..
I have waited 3 days that felt like a week. Did I miss when the next part is coming? Whyyyy hook me and make me wait 😭
Glad to see you back king 🤴! Missed you thank you for bringing people smiles to their face
Shane please post the finale tomorrow
When Shane uploads my day gets 100 times better
So happy to see new content
Lmao y'all changed your opinion quick on a empty apology
And I love rylands daddy and mama and I loved how upset over the the tiktok shit with the bathrooms and his mom is too fucking cool
I’ve missed these videos once a week
Alright I have to comment, Morgan looks soo pretty.  Love you Shane, glad you are back.
Morgan looks so pretty
Shane: "Why is somebody in the trunk?! " Me: spits diet coke everywhere 🤣
LOVE YOU SO MUCH SHANE: THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK♥️♥️♥️
I do not claim any bad energy from this video✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️LIKE TO CLAIM
I mean this purely in the “please provide me with the big spooks!” way, but two intro videos, I need scares lmao
Morgan is so gosh pretty, anyone else agree?
I love how invested Rylands dad is about that tik tok challange lol.
LAWD, WELCOME BACK <3
⚠️Morgan please make Kendall Rae style videos⚠️ ur a natural!
“I missed you” BITCH WE MISSED YOU MORE BOO 🖤🖤🖤
Gets a notification that Shane uploaded  Me: literally chucked my homework and started watching.  Ps. Love you Shane so happy you are back❤️
A cliff hanger I’m not mad at
I’m so obsessed with rylands family and his grandma SHES ADORABLE 😂 also rylands dad with the tik tok vandalism😂😂
What is this series about?
Everyone clowning on grandma 😭😭
Shane should do something about lake Lanier
Finally it’s been 5days
Love you, Shane!! I've been watching your videos ever since you started YouTube, and I'm so happy you started Filming and uploading again!!❤️
Spooky 😳 scary spookie
shane. . . YAW
Shane is back and I am living for it!!!! ...also Ryland is so adorable and Morgan is stunning.....(Shane you are still my favorite of course)
You guys should look into gold camp road
Hahahahahahahaha. Oh my goooooooood. Roland's dad is funny. I hope the little shits taking a piss.........7:26
OK but when they mention third bridge I almost threw up in my mouth I live in Colorado and no no no no no no
Day made 💜👻
Bruce is low key iconic 😂
Morgan is seriously so pretty. But I’m glad to see you back Shane
no one talking about the tiktok challenge
I love Grandma and thank u for telling the true story about the natives that was killed for nothing...I'm native American and I'm proud....but I can't understand y the white people hated and hate natives....xoxo
Awesome video! I was a little worried because video one was too much cutting yourself down and not enough good stuff- This video however was epic!  WELCOME BACK!!
Already know I’m gonna love this vid :)
This literally gave me chills when you were talking about the massacre that happened. Im so glad your back canada loves you 💗 💓 🇨🇦🇨🇦
im terrified of fictional horror movies but perfectly fine with irl horror films. makes perfect sense 😌
"My electric car attacked my ass" 😂😂😂  I love their family!
RIGHT ON TIME
I can already say, nothing will happen in part 3
I have missed your uploads soooooo much like you don’t understand I checked your channel basically every day until I saw you uploaded I’m so happy😃
Rylands dad trying to help with scary video ideas and be cool by keeping up with the trends is so wholesome
Okay btw MORGAN LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL
I never clicked a video so fckng fast 😭😭
Chris's laugh makes me giggle
I really like morgan! Shes so beautiful
Keep posting pls I been a fan four years
I love the serieus Shane!!!  Great series!!
Good lord the cemetery/park creeped me tf out 💀 good series I've got chills!
Love u
I’m a teacher and we’ve discussed the TikTok thing less than Bruce. He’s killing it in this episode. I hope we get more now that you live in Colorado. I really want to see you all go to Chessman Park.
justice for the annoying orange
i am sooo excited for this series!!! I have been binging on paranormal videos and I am so happy you put in clips from OmargoshTV. He is truly a great investigator (I don't think he calls himself that) but this is amazing!! So glad you are coming back.
RYLANDS DAD TALKING ABOUT THE DEVIOUS LICKS IS SENDING ME
I'm so, so, so happy you're back, doing what you love..sharing your gifts. I'm so excited about part 2!!
I live for these series, thank u for coming back shane🧎
Lol Morgan says "an aspiration"..totally her 🤣 Also, her makeup game has been stepped UP!
Yikes , that third bridge sounds like a eerie and  spooky place. Look forward to the finale 😊
The random destroying bathroom thing was so funny
Going back to the part about kids trashing the restrooms it's not just at the schools. At my work we had a hand sanitizer ripped off the wall. People who do that are annoying and childish please grow up, your not funny and your not cute your simple very annoying. I would say keep that shit at school but don't even do it there it's very childish and disrespectful. I'm 16 and hate school very very much but that is just very disrespectful. Too the people who do that learn some respect.
just realized Shane moved to my home town and right up the street from my best friend… wtf
Definitely didn’t stop studying for my midterms because this is more important
Shane's back, B!TCH!!! PLEASE, DO NOT STOP!! We love and have missed you!
Things follow me “Chris “ did Shane just get possessed there for a second
please stop
I waited all day for this video! It did not disappoint. Thank you Shane and all the family. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up when you mentioned the native Americans. Caint wait for till the  next one.👍💯👻🎃
This video really made me realize how much i missed Shane's editing 😭😭😭.
❤️😂LoL when Shane at 7:11 said “..did they just ran out of dance moves??”😂❤️
I'm all for listening to Dad talk about stories
Glad to see you again Shane so excited to see what’s next much love. 😊
Still can’t believe your back Shane! I’m so happy!
I love these and understand but waiting a week in between kills me 😖
i cannot describe how happy I am that you are posting again. Welcome back :)
Honestly, Shane makes the best videos
“Ugh it’s dead 👹like the massacre victims👹.. well anyways so what I’m doing now…” Lmfaoo what 😭  18:38
no cus istg morgan is that gorgeous for no reason <3 i am living for this series, we missed you more!!
I've missed you too I love that you're backkkk
MORGAN is so beautiful i cannot pay attention 💀
hey, i love your documentaries! when you make your horror movies you should do them in like a documentary style like the Blair witch project or the taking of Deborah Logan, you would do so well with those!
not the devious lick challenge PLS😭
Bruce is an unappreciated character! I love his honesty and just overall dad vibes! King!!
I waited all day for this video! It did not disappoint. Thank you Shane and all the family. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up when you mentioned the native Americans. Caint wait for till the next one.👍💯👻🎃
Missed these videos!! So happy you're back Shane!
I had plans to visit Colorado until Morgan said it’s more likely to die here than in California I backed out in a heart beat lol
I am super happy Shane is back! It feels like my family is complete again with Shane and the gang!
My man Omar😁
So glad Shane is finding his truth .!!! Came running here from my notifications!!
Very sad story of what happened to our indigenous people many years ago. Appreciate the acknowledged history in this video. Nice to see Shane back!
29:25 yeahhhhh Colorado is scary… but it can also be fun as long as you have the proper protection!
CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT YOUTUBE VIDEO TO COME OUT💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Noooooo...it ended too soon 👻
Love the shout out to Omargoshtv!!!
They remind me of my family . But all my family died except my aunt and uncle even my mom is dead . I'm so lonely . His grandma reminds me of my grandma barb
You mean Kai Kai Morgan
I definitely UNsubbed why am I resubbed??
Didn’t Morgan get a house in Colorado?
First off, GRANDMA is a LEGEND!! Secondly, my kids school system sent a message out to all the parents and families talking about the school destruction tik toks and the ramifications they would get for doing so. Lastly, I always seriously appreciate the hell out of the editing of your videos! I love how you put the clips in all throughout with any explanations, news clips, video clips and all. It helps so much and really brings the stories to life!! I love it!
This series came just in time for spooky season 👻 Can’t wait for the next video!
❣💞
😊😊😊
i’m so happy about this series it’s amazing
YES ITS UP
Raise your hand if you went to the Cherry Creek school District 👋 I went to smoky
Honestly think bout it where are all the graves of the ones past we are walking and living on graves that are no longer marked
the ppl who disliked are the ones who dont want to be haunted after watching this video
I can’t wait for next week episode now. I really hope we’re going to see loads more of these kinda videos from Shane as love these. ❤️
When is the truck reviel btw ryland teased it and it hasn't came through 😩👀
God I'm so happy Shane is back... I've been watching this dude since I was 8 like during spooky season? Literally so happy
i cant believe he seriously is just moving on like its all good now lol. what a clown
Morgan is so well spoken, I just love her!
is grandma coming???? she wouldnt hear it!!! LOL hahaha priceless...  Shane im so glad your back... what better time to come back then October babyyy
Being from Colorado and seeing this is crazy. I had no idea there was anything like this in Denver.
AWESOME JOB SHANE, AWESOME FUCKING JOB!!! SOOO DAMN GLAD YOU’RE BACK!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I got so excited when I saw that he posted I’ve missed him so much
Every beat this people made with there mouth is totally incorrect. Most drums have several individual paying it, or several with there own drums. And there’s not just WAR drums their used for many other spiritual reasons ..
The fact that he mentioned the devious licks is hilarious! My school had to shut two of the batjrooms down to stop them.
so we just gon forget that this man is a master manipulator.. aight.
According to the ads on this video First of all... I need JESUS! And I need to find love using astrology or something lol
Hmm having parks on former cemeteries is completely normal here in Europe. They are even called old cemeteries and they have old tombstones and stuff… I guess we just don’t have as much space here to think this a bad or unusual thing
This is the most active I've been on YouTube since u left lol I have zero reasons to be here unless it's to watch ur videos.
I love how Shane always uses small creators as sources for his videos ❤️
Morgan is looking absolutely stunning… AS ALWAYS!
so glad to have you back shaneyyyyy
the music is ridiculous
Don't die yet Shane we love you😂💖
It's not spooky season without you, Shane!  So glad you're back <3
A Channel of rylands dad and grandma please
She’s 24?!?
I've been craving for these whole quarantine now we got it!
Shane you certainly didn't disappoint, 😁👌🏽 not that I expected you too 😉  it was so nice to see you happy again and enjoying life.🙌  Your a great guy don't ever forget that ☺  a talented 👏  great guy at that 😬 can't wait for the final finally 😀
I been there so many time and it’s crazy each time I went we alway be running out
Ryland's granma is so precious ❤️❤️🥺🥺
I love being high bc I put myself in a senario in my head where I met Shane Dawson an just cried happy tears bc he the best love you shannee!!❤️
I LOVE YOU SHANE ❤️❤️
oh thank god, i needed something actually good to watch, so glad your back, literally fuck the haters, us lot that are still here should matter more, as we still love ya xxxxxx
Dude I saw this post and my finger literally froze, tears immediately filled my eyes and I literally started scream whispering “HES BACK SHANES BACK”
I can't wait for the next video!!!!!!! Loving this !!
Love. 😂❤️
youtube is so much better now that your back!! yay so happy ✌️💕
glad your back love you shane! <3
Y’all forgive too easy
Wait didn’t Morgan just buy a house?
LITERALLY our bathrooms were closed for 2 weeks. an it was only the boys bathroom
I’m going to need these to be longer 🥲
I need a final soon I'm going to die
Am I the only person a little frustrated 2 episodes in and no ghost hunting.
SHANE WE MISSED YOU😔
Currantly watching this with a chinchilla running around the room
Ya'll need to do a series on Cheesman Park with Papa Bruce next. Love how into the researching he is.
Grandma is a treasure.
Now this is what i needed today. Shane is just a great guy who has the best videos. So talented!
I'm convinced that no matter the actual length of the video; that because of the editing, content, people, etc., Shane's Amazing videos just go by too quickly!!  But, I'll take what I can get, better short Shane videos/documentaries than none at all!
I’ve been waiting so long for Shane to come back😫❤️
I can't wait for part three and Morgan miss story teller now doing her research lol you go girl ❕❗ Morgan: "Did you know the Annoying Orange is back ❔❓" Me: *pauses video to look and make sure it's true* 😅
Here for Morgan
RYLANDS DAD TALKING ABOUT DEVIOUS LICKS HAHAHHAHA
I probably shouldn’t be watching this at night…alone…in the country where no one can hear me if I scream. WELP.
I do believe that the veil is being lifted and the "spirit world" is becoming more visible. Dark entities etc are harder to hide. I think the world is going to get a lot crazier before it gets better..... so many are oblivious to the real darkness ruling this world... whether they choose to believe or not, truth is stranger than fiction....
8:51 Born, raised and still live in CA… Papa Adams is 💯 correct. I hate it here. Overrated
Yass!!! Glad your backkkkk
Morgan is such vibes
“Right to his dick” i love Bruce
Shook !
I wanna show the creepy spookies hahahhaa I love that
I live near an oil pump and I'm pretty sure it doesn't make noise
Shane: "Do you know what they are talking about grandma?" Grandma: "Nope!"  Why is this me
And I also said third bridge lol
Ryland’s dad is my hero.
Dark out now so watching for the second time today. Even creepier this time around.
This looks so good! The story telling was great to learn more about history as well as the ghost stuff we all live from you. Also Morgan do you know just how beautiful you are
We missed you too
Please do more conspiracy and or ghosty vids I loved when you went to like queen marry and stuff okay happy Halloween I’m gonna watch now 🥰
"Grandma wouldn't hear them coming." Love her heart. She is a treasure and should be protected forever!!
this is why we made you that book of notes 🥰 we needed you back! you are so loved Shane, keep making the spoopy content i’m living for it.
If I don’t get genuinely scared in the next part………then I’ll get slightly disappointed
I just want to know why Bruce’s on tiktok???? 😂😂😂😂😂
Ditto, Grandma, I'm glad Shane is doing this too <3
Shane seems so happy, so excited for part 3😩
I’m so happy your back, I love your content <3
Please I needed this video for so long
Shane ! This is wonderful 💞 So excited to see your face online again ! I love that you and Ryland have family around.
Will always love Shane 😭
Yay! I can get all cozy in bed with snick-snacks and watch spooky Shane Dawson content. Literally obsessed.  🥰
I’m so happy you’re back
Soooo Morgan is STUNNING 🥴😍
Them devious licks
33:54 : Be careful what you wish for, me : Parker
Yay, you have @OmarGoshTv featured in your video :)
Morgan: I feel like Kendall Rae    We stan a queen 💕
I gotta say, I was really into this video until I saw OmarGoshTV.  Nothing against you Shane, it's just he is known for faking his videos.  When I see someone like him in a video like this, it really takes me out of the spooky vibe.  I am glad to see you back!  I hope everything is good with you and yours!
🌻
OH YES! THIS WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!
BRING DOWN TIK TOK SHANE
Shane: "yeah, everything follows me, right Ryland?"  Ryland: "Ummm demons, ghosts or do you mean... me..?"  loved that
i missed you so much!! i missed this CONTENT!! i love you!! <33
i still love him idc. after everything that's happened this past year, i need this
Shane Poopson
U post😟💕
Omg finally !!!!
Morgan looks SO stunning in this video💕
Ohh my lord I needed this! Love you Shane ❤️
Shane: posts  Me: stops my entire college essay to watch in the middle of my library 🤡
Shane coming back has been the absolute highlight of my month and honestly I plan on moving to Colorado with my husband and I hope that I can finally meet you (my idol)
Morgan looks so beautiful here🔥
We have a mountain names Mt. Evans. However because of this story people want to change to name of that mountain
WE MISSED YOU
Rylands dad so proud of his shocking penis joke sent me soaring. Such a dad moment 😂
The only horror series I’m watching this Halloween is Shane Dawson
this episode feels misplaced. like it should've been longer. feels like the series is being drug out too long. not hate, just seems like the beginning of the investigation could've been added to this episode... would've left me more excited for the next one.
I am so hyped for this!! Love u Shane ❤️❤️
So either you did die at the place and someone is posting all of these video for you, or you all live and your fine but had something follow you back home? orrr something did happen... Gah cant not wait for the last episode I need to know what's going to happen.
I’m a broken record but I’m SO glad you’re back!
just woke up todays is gonna be a draining one..thanks shane this brightened up my day ❤
I hope the last part is longer, long videos from you are the best!
Okay Morgan is thiccccc 🤍🤍🤍
I don't claim any negative energy from this video🙏
Morgan is so beautiful!
Okay so one time I was sleeping and then I woke up to a cut inside my lip I was so  sacred and I had no idea how I got it also I had bruises in my arms
Imagine a Mr. Ballen and Shane collab...
Shane you are the best at making stuff so suspenseful, and leave us begging & dying wanting more!!!
I love that Shane posting new vids but I hate the way camera moved it made me nauseated 😭
Mama Vicki: "Don't say that on camera." 🤣
in 15 seconds it goes from: i guess you didn't know that,things follow me Chris to: hey did you guys know that the annoying orange is back
I love it when Morgan complained about mom knocking as she's walking in. Moms house moms rule. You get to stay and mom gets to rule
Ugh shaneeeee youre killing me dude!  I dont wanna wait till next week to see what happens!
I love grandma can she be my grandma ❤️
When is #3? :(
🤗
This was SOOO well edited
When is the final video come out I need to know😑😶
Grandma is an icon. Also im glad to see you back shane, im also glad to see you doing better mentally. I wish you the best and im excited for the last part!
morgan is so stunning
is shane a dairy farmer now? with how much he is milking all of this XD luv ya gurl
Shane, things don’t follow you, you have the biblical spiritual gift of discernment, look it up, this gift is also what gives you deep empathy. Trust you’re fake internet Mama on this, i know because i am very strong in this gift. The things you sense are always around, most people are just not tuned into it. You are.  Its a legit biblical thing.  Trust.
Shane Dawson, you are awesome...I am so glad to see your face, Makes me smile inside everytime....in a good way, lmao. We have gone through tremendous changes of pop culture and social media since I was young ( I'm only 38 ffs)....opinions aren't allowed and even comedy gets turned into negativity and hate. Sending love and positivity from Nova Scotia Canada ❤️.
Dang it.  I thought it was going to be more then what it was for this video. Can't wait for the next one!
My YouTube suppressed the hellllllll out of this, was hard to find 😅😅
I thought Shane did something bad? Why did you all switch up so quickly? can someone explain what he did?
Grandma owns my heart ✋🏻
I literally have been waiting so long for Shane to come back! You are an amazing editor! Love you Shane!
I'm in Longmont CO and this is so awesome for m lol
Omigosh he’s back yess we needed this
Shane really needs to tighten his edits, this is a really slow series and while he's trying to build tension it doesn't happen when there's so much breathing space.
Im native American and i have never heard this story before😦 Thank you shane for coming back 💕
*Shane comes back* Me: *jumps in bed and grabs some snacks* ahhh memories. Here we go again. Back into depression with Shane 😂 he only understands
finally❤❤❤❤
Fucking love you Shane so glad you are back
When I saw the title I thought it was gonna be one of the conspiracy theories videos like he did before
I loving the Series I can’t wait till the third part
🥰🥰🥰
So happy Shane is uploading again, 2020 and 2021 has been so rough for me. This is what I needed 🙏🏻♥️
I am having a really hard time picturing Ryland with girlfriends
Omg i need the finale!!!
I fucken missed this lol
This is sooo well done!!! Awesome job Shane! I'm glad your back 💕
I knew it. shane was trying to come back by appearing in rylands channel.
Ryland’s dad is a whole mood talking about how those kids get karma 😂😂😂
did shane cry when he said "things follow me" like i got sad for a moment (yes I cry to small things like that lmao)
Ryland's dad was cracking me up and I would totally listen to a song called my electric car attacked my ass...just saying
I knew it! The last video I kept saying Cheesman park and sure enough!
Shanes back! F*ck Yeah!!
AMAZING
I'm so happy to have Shane back and I absolutely love the whole family💙
I got my snacks and I’m ready!!
Was so disappointed to see it’s only 34mins😭❤️❤️❤️.
So excited your back shane HUGS now if Jenna Marbles comes back too my life would be complete
It’s about time sis. Needed for spooky szn 😫🙏
I guess you can do countless horrible things, pretend you've changed, and go back to making millions.  Good job YouTube 👏👏👏
you don’t understand how long i’ve waited for this
Yayyyyy I missed y’all so much!!!!
Omargosh TV!!! ❤️🥰
I wanna see part 3 already!!
I think the scariest thing in this video was that guy using a fork in a metal pan.
😍😘😍
Did anyone else find the creepy music and sound effects on the part where they explain Cheesman Park extremely distracting and annoying?
Who else wishes it was jenna that came back 😭 sorry Shane I like you and all but Jenna would be the light in this shit worls right now.
i hope rylands dad catches those whippersnappers destroying the urinals
I'm so happy that your back, I missed your videos. I have been pretty depressed lately so seeing this video made my day.
this is so wild being from colorado and like growing up and going to cheeseman park and shit
SHANE!!! You should do to riverdale rd in colorado there is the gates of hell out there!!!
Omargoshtv!!!!!! Fantastic!!!
I can explain how much I missed Shane and the squad  😫😫 love you guys 🥺
OMGGGGG I MISSED HIM😩📎
Rylands dad is kinda EVERYTHING!
Shane: "Colorado is WEIRD." Meanwhile in Wisconsin: Literally the same kind of shit lol
All it takes is a Shane uploaded notification and all of a sudden my day is 100 xs better <3
This is exactly what I need this spooky season!!! Shane Dawson back in the game doing his thing😊😊❤❤
Not me asking my boss for an extension on my lunch break for this 😐
I can’t with the hyperventilating laugh.. is that the camera guy?
SHANE SAYS THAT HE MISSED US BUT THEN IM LIKE NO HUNTI MAMA, WE MISSED U
I’m so nervous for the finale lol
SOOOOOOO GLAD UR BACK WE'VE MISSED U SOOOOOOO MUCH. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
Love u shane so glad ur in my state !!!
I am so glad to see you back! I’ve missed you! 💜
PART 3 WHEN?
Love this video but the music was a little distracting in the background. Maybe lower the volume down a bit.
Welcome back Shane!!! Pls pls pls keep doing content like this and the conspiracy one miss you all so much!! The worlds a mess right now glad you are back! And screw the haters real fans missed you💖
Okay but Morgan is way too pretty for no reason
What Shane didn't realize was that as soon as he uploaded a new ghost video he would go from cancelled to loved and told he was missed quicker then he could blink..    He'll always be one of YouTube's biggest and brightest.   That's just a fact.
Loving this series and loving more that ur back 😁
You were all entertaining before but I feel like everyone's really gotten even funnier and wittier.
This is creepy AF. Heck if you wanna do a jokey ghost hunters like show that would be awesome because that’s what I do when things get creepy I try and laugh about stuff cause if I get too scared I feel like I’m feeding what’s there to try and hurt me. But if I laugh at it all they can do is get frustrated and not hurt me.
“California’s very toxic.” * wishes teenagers harm
Oh yeah
Morgan is the GOAT, well, maybe Grandma then Morgan 🤣.   I can not wait until the next episode!!!
Lel
I’m so damn happy you’re back!
It's weird that when shane uploads  videos it takes me back to a simpler time in my life ❤
Thats it ? 😐
Need to wait till next Thursday 😭😩
This comment section is disgraceful 🤮
I can't wait for part 3!
I'm so glad ur makin scary series again I love them sm I love u all aswell seeing u and Ryan together having a good time just makes me super happii 🖤💕💕<3 !!!
Morgan looks more beautiful and happier than ever
You can’t lie He knows how to edit his video to be interesting
The most happy your slowly coming back to YouTube! & the internet in general!!   Also me watching these knowing I hate scary stuff 😅 but watching it cause I missed your videos!!
Can we please all agree Papa Bruce was the MVP of this video?
Ryland's Grandma is the sweetest thing. I wish I had that in my life. The whole family really seems very genuine and it's a breath of fresh air.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Ryland’s family! LMAO!! 🤣🤣🤣
shane im sorry what didnt we drive you off the internet lmai
their called devious licks💪 they also put a sign in my school saying how would u like if there was no soap or toilet paper. and they locked all the bathrooms for like a week

I'm sorry but this is too cringey.
I missed you ❤️
It's so nice having your videos to look forward to again, Shane. You were missed my friend. There's always going to be negative ppl out there that are miserable themselves so they don't have the ability to move past things in life. There are a lot MORE of us out here that not only respect and understand your capacity for growth. We love you Shane, thanks again!!
I wish the video was longer. It’s about to be over and I feel a overwhelming feeling. His videos makes me forget about the bad thts going on in my life. I love you Shane. ❤️
Ok I’m from a oil Field area and I’ve never heard any drum like sounds from any of the equipment
I LOVE GRANDMA!!!!! What an amazing lady. She is so fun and loves you so much.
So glad you’re back ❤️ got so overly excited when I got the notification ❤️
I’m so happy you’re back.❤️

im so excited rn😹😹😭 we miss you
I need Bruce to tell me to get my shit together
Shane thank you. You're videos get me out of the world and my head.
i missed this lol i stopped everything i’m doing to watch ❤️
Shane's face when Ryland was talking about bringing his girlfriends to the bridge to make out was priceless 😂
I literally stopped everything to watch this
Everyone's talking about how amazing grandma is but y'all we need to acknowledge how amazing Bruce has been in all the videos including Morgan's. He's so precious!
I am so happy to have you back ! Love you 😍
Rylands family is so nice and sweet. I love it.
Best content on youtube, hands down
😃🤩 I’ve missed seeing your name pop up on my notifications for new videos, so glad you’re back, we missed you!!! 🙌🏼🤗🧡🧡🧡
Thank you so much for this Shane my mom passed away 7 years ago today and this video lifted my spirits so very much. Thank you for getting me through today ❤
STOP EVERYTHING - SHANE JUST UPLOADED TWICE IN ONE WEEK!!!!!!!!
WOW Morgan is stunninggggg
Grandma Janice is a whole Mood, Sis bye- 🪦
So when does the haunting part start? Is that part coming soon?

I'm so happy you're posting again Shane I missed you so much. Your content makes my day.
I wanna like this but I'm bored
I think I’m going to investigate the haunted areas we have here where we live…
Ahhhhhh missed you so much Shane! Just what we all needed in 2021 🥰🥰🥰
I NEEDED THIS
I will be right back to watch this ..after I clean up my house and dry up my fucking dogs piss…..then off to the fridge to grab 6 Budweiser’s and watch this vid tipsy cause u know what I had the worst day of my life today and I know this vid will make me feel better …glad your back Shane I missed you

So happy to see you in your element Shane. I hope this series continues to inspire you for ur future in movie making! Love and appreciate u always, ❤❤❤
Kind of sad this coming out so soon I wish it was just a bit closer to Halloween 🎃

I’ve missed you Shane ….. Do you like scary movies what’s your favorite kind of scary movie
McGovern :(
Yessss Shane! This is what we’ve needed!!!  Also, I’m scared.
YESS!! shane uploaded!!!
God, i've missed you sooooo much❤❤
Thankyou for coming back Shane ♡ when you post it feels like everything is back to normal - pre covid.  Its like a second of fresh air 🙌🏼❤
Not everybody closing YouTube at 4 minutes 57 seconds in and opening tik tok searching for the trend that's ongoing 😂😂😂
I MISSED YOU GUYSSSS! I’m so glad ur backkk
Omg I can’t wait for the finale!  Please do more Shane!  Love y’all ❤️
I am not sorry but this was the worst paranormal video shane tried to make.
More looked so young in that clip from 2018.
Loving grandma 🥺
Hey Shane love your content thanks to my fiancé. She met you at book con in New York. Was wondering if you be willing to go some where haunted in Connecticut!? Please let me know through here! I only have Facebook and email!
To be a part of Shane horror.. #Dream
How did I not get the notification😪
I’m so happy your back. Can’t wait for the final x
BUT ARE WE GETTING A HALLOWEEN SPECIAL?!! <3
7 Minutes in and I already love Rylands Dad LOL hes hilarious :)
There is a park in Kingston, Ontario the same as cheesman, same story about a burial dumping ground. Lovely picnic spot!
27:26 🤣🤣🤣
In my opinion, native Californians are pretty chill. The toxic people obsessed with “being a star” from the Midwest and the South keep coming here and stinking it up though. 😩
Protip for teenagers: Don't go anywhere where there is no reception on a first date. That's just basic common sense.
WHY WAS I NOT NOTIFIED, YOUTUBE
Literally can't help but laugh when shane goes " i hope i dont die!" grandma : " yeah.."  :'D
Shane really came back with a bang. SO GOOD. These new videos are making me soooo happy ❤️
Omg Rylands dad had me dying talking about kids messing up bathrooms. And when Ryland said grandma wouldn't hear them coming I lost it. I love grandma, so happy your back Shane.
I've been waiting until it got dark just to watch this <3 8 on the dot
I LOVE SHANE, ALWAYS HAVE, ALWAYS WILL.
i’m so glad you’re back shane!
CHEESEMAN PARK?!? It’s scary because the homeless population moved in after covid. There are so many more haunted places in Colorado. Cheeseman is so far from anything even remotely haunted
why is everyone being so nice in the comments? i used to be fan so I get it if you like him or his content nd you're expressing that but I find it so hard to be at all positive about him after what has come out and what I now know about his past things. Some of that stuff is unforgivable and I don't understand how everyone is switching up so fast to cancelling him and then suddenly being huge supporters
OOOOOOOOH! :D
This is so cool. Well done Shane. Missed you 👏😎💕
YES SHANE I MISSED YOUR SPOOKY VIDSS
we all missed you so much shane.
Omg Morgan and Kendall Rae do a video..I'd be dead  ❤❤ love ya shane
Where’s the old camera man
I’ve missed these vibes 👻
Ugh I can’t wait!!!!! I need to know what happens!!!!!  I have been thinking about this all week
YOU CAME BACK WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED YOU MOST, BOO❤
yall i cant be the only onw who was literally in tears when he posted
Shane, please!! Put us some subtitles! Sometimes i don't catch what someone says and tho my english is awesome, it remains my second language 😅 so happy you're back btw. This seems good, you look better and I've missed you and this content SO MUCH ♥️
Eeek!! 👻 Shane and Halloween 🎃!!! 🥰🥰 couldn’t be more content!!
I'm so, so  happy you're back!!!💜💜💜
Ryland, “ she wouldn’t hear them coming.”
Glad to see you back 👍🏽
Rylands dad needs his own Chanel please !
At some point when you were talking with your family, ryland's parents, grandma and sister I felt something so homey and warm as if I was there and kinda forgot my own life for a second... My family is great but... For a second there it felt like the family I never had but always wanted... Thank you for sharing this moment...
Rylands dad speaking facts
the freaking king is back!!!!!!!
Rylands dad is literally giving me life 😂😂❤️he’s hilarious
Morgan looks amazing ❤️❤️
Absolutely love that your creating again! I have looked so forward to this!! Can’t wait for part 3!!!
If Shane wasnt famous, no one would forgive him. He was a grown ass adult man when he did that shit. Not some stupid 13 year old. Shame on all of you.
Ah I love this so much. Shane I love your videos. Can’t wait for the finale.
Love the editing btw, can't wait for the finale
EXCITED FOR PART 3!!  I used to explore abandoned places and just freaky places!! I was never alone and filmed the experiences. LOVE THIS.  Let's go Shane! 👻🙃
I missed u Shane so much and u are so sweet and kind and I just love u and I can’t wait to see more videos
With Shane back my life feels normal again! <3
Ahhh Shane! Love you! Leaving me hanging for part 3!!!😜🥰😘💞🍂🍁🎈
Shane I like the content BUT WHY IS IT SO DRAMATIC OMG
Why is everyone so happy and fake in the comments they all been accused of the same thing too?
is it just me or did this feel like a 34 minute trailer
I love that Ryland’s dad talked more in this video! He seems so nice.
Morgan is so pretty
Nice to have you back! Missed watching your videos
Can Shane comment? And like?
**scary music**  Morgan: Did you know the annoying orange is back? :D
I’m so happy Morgan is finally glowing and loving her life. (Okay but even if she isn’t feeling the happiest, whatever she is doing is bringing her to the greater good and that’s FACTS!!) love u mojo mogo
YESS!!!! FINALLY!!!! MORE MORE MORE MORE PLEASE MORE
Not me signing to move into an apartment a couple blocks from cheesman yesterday 🙃
People are crazier in Colorado. I lived there for 1 year and I'll never go back.
“ is grandma coming?” “ she wouldn’t hear anything anyway”   😂😂  We love grandma!!
I’m so glad Shane is back seriously 😩
Shane Ik you may not see this comment but I just wanted to say I missed you so much and I love how much you’ve grown and love your videos. I’ve been watching your videos for years and I want to become an influencer in my own way too! You’re a big inspiration to who I am and I wanted to say thank you for being the light in my life for so long. 💖💖💖
Omg you look amazing 🤩
Finally something GOOD TO WATCh and and excuse to relax and stop everything your doing 😭
I’m sorry but that girl in the black hoodie explaining Shane being haunted is annoying like stfu what do u know
Man, I just moved out of Aurora last year! I never heard of Third Bridge or the Sand Creek Massacre until now :o what an interesting/tragic place and event to learn about! I didn't even know the story of Cheesman Park either.. I'm so glad you are back Shane!
ryans dads so cute
Had to look twice at my notifications!!! So excited to see Shane and his scary series!!🤗🤗🤗
shana pls start making conspiracies again
My jaw was just wide open in the shock of that story of the undertaker and Cheesman park, so spoopy! (gotta say spoopy so it makes it less scary)
This was so fun to watch! Literally every second held my interest. Love love love creepy stuff and I love how the family was included. Feeling freaked out and happy all at the same time lol ❤️👏👍
Please tell me he's gonna do more stuff after this series.
Oliver is the scariest thing in the video.
Nooo i was so ready for you guys to start heading to Third Bridge then it ended!! But i’m scared anyways so i have to get myself ready
I appreciate the history lesson about the Sand Creek Massacre, I've never heard of it till now. How sad 😔
Hey Shane! 🎃
omg please collab with Kendall Rae love her sooooo much
I love how passionate and infuriated Ryland's dad with people on tiktok destroying school properties.
Nurse! Nurse! My pen15 spontaneously combusted in class!
i love you shane & everyone else
I missed u
Glad you're back. You and Jenna were my youtube ogs
I'm hooked up from minute 1 and only at the end I noticed 30 min went by and I was invested the whole time. I've missed you Shane and indeed the way you create. So rare in today's content - whilst I can be entertained by 50 second clips - I am much more interested in the progress of a developing story and clearly its build up can be as interesting as the conclusion. Cannot wait for Part 3. <3
SHANE WHENS PART THREE COMING OUT I CANT WAITTTTTT😂😂❤️
I love Shane with all of my heart
You should talk about Dont Hug Me I’m Scared
Get to the ghost hunting!!
Omg seeing the flashbacks from 2018 was so surreal! I’m so happy we have had so many years of these amazing videos and seeing rylands family!!
I have missed Shane so much! This is exactly what I needed. No one else's videos compare. He needs his own nextflix series.
YOOOOUUUURRRR BACK YAAAY!
I went to cheesman Park at night to go ghost hunting but didn't find or feel anything
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER NOW YAYYU
“i hope i don’t die🥺” “yeah😃” PLEASE grandma janice is so unintentionally funny
Am I like the only one who’s OBSESSED with rylands dad ? He’s funny asffff. I came here to comment that as I’m watching it on my tv😂😂
I'm loving the spooky videos!
HES BACKKK OMGG
U need to do a colab with Bailey Sarian Shane. I loooooove her and I love u. Match made in spooky heaven... Xo D.G.
After all you been through, I missed you shane, your a funny guy to watch, you deserve a lot of love❤, you should make trying out food videos again, lol... cough!.. " Arby's is trash",. Lmfao. Keep up the good work Queen.👑☺👍
Comments: "6,666" ... well okay wow. LOL Also, I am so happy Shane is back, there are no words. I'm so ready to have some drinks and snacks, and enjoy another epic video from my favorite YouTuber/celebrity of all time... <3 WB Shane!
❤ Shane is back ❤ Spooky season ❤ Morgan is gorg ❤ Colorado > LA ❤ Grandma Janice ❤
Love this conversation Shane has started with all of us. No matter where you live we all know a story about a spooky place. Some of the stories came from our parents. Where I'm from it was the Stone House. Crazy stories about that place.
I'm super jealous, my family refuses to be my ghost hunting crew 💀
Mr. Adams should be happy. He can capitalize on the bathrooms being destroyed.
Shane I'm so happy you're back 😭😭❤️❤️
Ryland’s parents are soooo sweet!
Omg 😳 I can’t wait until the next episode. Every time I see Shane has posted something I get my ear buds and click on the video, because I know it’s going to be awesome 😎. I have never been disappointed with any of Shane’s videos.
So crazy the first add before the video started was Scream how crazy is that
did they move
I love when Shane says something dark and Rylan always says "Shane!"
Shane please just acknowledge me I know you’re active you just posted a video
Can’t wait for part 3!!!
Oh my god!! I’m SOOOOO HAPPY right now 😁😁😁 I have grabbed my coffee and settled in, Shane I HAVE MISSED YOUUUUU 😘😘😘😘😘
Always a great night when there's a Shane video to watch. :) That same thing happened half a block away from my house. When they extended our street to make room for a subdivision and nursing homes, they accidently dug up bodies from a really, really old cemetery that was supposed to have been moved years before. Instead, the contractor just moved the headstones. There was also a second location in town where it happened too. In the end, work had to be halted while all the bodies were relocated. Unfortunately, they all wound up being reburied in a mass grave because none were identifiable by then.  So sad. :(
this is so boring
We have a park with an old burial ground in my city too.
Brilliant .. I'm so excited not only for part 3 but for Shane in general, so great to have you back 🤩🥰
This was really good. Glad your back Shane ☺
Very excited about this!! 🎃🕷️💀 So happy to see Shane posting
Ghost hunting aside Morgan is so gorgeous 🥺👉👈
YESSIRRRRR
Didn’t this guy do something with animals?
Ryland tell Morgan I said wassup 😎🥰
Now watch all the haters make a reaction video about Shane’s new video.  Monetized too……. They should be thanking Shane for the revenue he is giving them for using his content.
Minus 11.5 million views in one day? What did you delete?
Shane we all missed you so much, so happy for you and excited for this series
im so happy he’s back. Shane, i sincerely hope you have learned from your past and you can grow from it<3 i wish you the best in your youtube and filming career, you will always have a very significant spot in my childhood xoxoxo<3
I can't cope with scary stuff but I'm so happy to see Shane upload again that I'm watching regardless 😅
Awhh grandma ❤
Hi Shane I missed you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who wants to watch the video bout the time I was almost possessed while we wait for part 3 https://youtu.be/WBBIZbLR1Lw
I love & miss youu Shane !!
I called it in the last video that they would be going to Third Bridge. I grew up in that area and everyone goes out there at some time. I know tons of people who have experienced things there. Also, Ryland's dad is totally right about Cheeseman Park. I have stories from that place too.
The background 'creepy' music is ridiculous and annoying.
Omg I've been looking forward to this!!!
fav morgan quote "did you guys know?... sorry.. That the annoying orange is back?"
Bruce is a gem. We all need a Bruce in our lives!
I've been binging Shane's old conspiracies all week omgggggg
WE HAVE MISSED YOU!  Welcome back Shane!
Ah yes the so called devious licks 🙄
Shane, where i grew up in Illinois is where the 7 gates of Hell start. You want to know some scary stuff and that also has ties to satanic sacrifices. its wild
Goes on about the new tiktok trend me thinking do they now have soap at home 😂
The way Ryland is JUST like his dad especially with his mannerisms is crazy!!!! Love yall!
⭐ *I'VE MISSED YOU TOO* 😘 ... CAN'T WAIT FOR VIDEO # 3 Everyone  , Stay Safe 😷 & 💖 Much Love ~ 😈🔺🦋
So glad you’re back, Shane! I knew you would. You have a gift, so definitely you’d eventually go back to what makes you happy and fulfills you. Hope no one takes that away from you <3
OMG YASSS!! So soo happy you're back!! All time BOSS of YouTube!!! Love you!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰💟💟💟💟
I live in Southeastern Colorado (the not pretty mountain part) and there are so many creepy ghost stories over here. You should check it out sometime. Also the old mining towns etc. Super creepy stuff! And interesting history.
LIVING! For new Shane videos! So glad you're back for Good!!
i thought the yellow flashlight that shane was holding was a corn
I faked being sick just so i could have the day off and watch this
Shane I wished you made this series longer I need full 1 or 2 hours to watch each episode that's how good your at making videos!
BRUCE IS A GEM LOL
Cheeseman Park is just like a golf course in Sarasota Florida where it used to be a burial ground for Ringling Circus animals.
pissing screaming crying
Audio is so gooood
Ryland's dad is the Tea, and it's refreshing.
Oh, Lord... They killed native Americans???!! This is why America has never been in peace, with massive unstable mental people 😣 In my country Indonesia, Kalimantan, we do have native people, they said you can live here but don't disturb us inside the forest. If you mess up with them, believe me, your head will be cut off by a flying sword. Just google Sampit Conflict in Borneo. For those who do not believe it, I dare them to try to mess up with original native/ethnic people and see If they can survive 🙄 Be careful Shane 💕💕💕 Love your videos 🌹🌹🌹
AND ITS ALREADY POSTED
Rylands dad is fkn hilarious, and then we have mom in background saying don't say that on camera..
Hell yea! Needed this today
I’m sooooooooo happy that you are back love you
Me just getting my merch from him and now sitting and watching this IN HIS MERCH, couldn't be happier <3
Talking about bathrooms do y’all clean them mfs ? No
😋I'm so happy he's back
OH MY GOD!!!!!!! Ok this is going to sound completely unbelievable but at around 17:10 there is a ghost being described by the woman about a cowboy with a trench coat and a hat from the 1800s. My husband, my sister in law, and myself have all seen this ghost several times at their childhood home and he looks exactly like this!!! I showed my husband this part of the video and he got goosebumps and started to tear up when he listened to her describe the figure. This is so creepy!!!!
I went to third bridge as a teenager and it is SUPER eerie 🥴
THIS IS A MOVIE!!!!
not me like getting into the video then "IN THE NEXT PART" pops up SHANE GIVE US THE THIRD PART NOW!!!!!!!
Poor smaller doggo just wanted to be pet too by rylands dad and he never did :(
I haven’t been this exited since the last video HAHAHAH❤️😭
this makes me want to make more paranormal videos
OMG I am the happiest ever that Shane is back doing what he does best. I am so scared watching these videos but they are sooo good. I've even went back to watch the Queen Mary and Stanley Hotel videos because I missed Shanes scary videos so much. Well just missed Shane on YouTube in general. Its actually made my wee heart so happy that he's happy they way he should be  ❤❤❤ love you Shane 😍
Like I know it’s fake but it’s still interesting to watch LMAO
"is grandma gonna come?" "she wouldn't hear em comin" 😭
I love that you’re back I missed you
I love these so much, i rly missed shanes series
jinkies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😱
shane’s 30 minute MOVIES are what is getting me through mid terms! shane is back!😍
i’ve missed you shane !!!
Around minute 11:20, when they say "And they walk around there at night!" my computer froze 😵
*Anyone mentions ghosts or anything slightly spooky ever*  Shane: 6:52
eating pizza in my closet while i watch this.. thats what my life has come too and im not mad about it.
My freakin face hurts from smiling…  My husband recorded me watching this like a freaking fangirl. Thank you.
The Sand Creek massacre is an absolutely heartbreaking and sad stain on my beautiful state’s history.
'familyyy' 😂
Omg your back yay :)
That news anchor oh yummy sent me💀🤣
I still can’t believe you’re back. It’s amazing! Can’t wait for part 3 😁
can we take a moment and talk about how shane and ryland have the same reaction at 0:23
Shane, your talent at making these videos has never ceased to amaze me. You are the only YouTuber that I've ever been able to really sit down and just binge watch their videos. No matter what you go through in life just remember that your talent shines so bright and you truly are just amazing. Never let anyone take that from you. We all go through terrible times and periods in our life where it really just feels like the whole world is against us but remember that there are a lot of us out here that are not against you. Just so happy to see you back.
THIS WAS SO SCARY AND NOTHING HAS EVEN HAPPENED YET
I need Bailey Sarian to do a history podcast on this place.
Glad you're back in action!!!!💙
I am so happy you are back Shane!!!  Missed your vids sm 💛
Ayy
I love these videos. I cant wait for the next one
Arapahoe? You mean like… Cardi B? 😂
But is anyone going to talk about what really went on in the bushes at Cheeseman Park at night back in the day? If you’re gay, then you know 🤫😉. But for real, the park is creepy nonetheless!
Shane is a good dude. You can tell he is one of those people you just get a good vibe from. Glad he’s back and making me smile and laugh because I really needed it!!!
rylands dad so funny
i love ryland's dad omg
MISSED YOU SHANE!!!
I’ve missed you ❤️
HUNNIE I LOVE that you're back!! I knew you would be, hold your head up high! We cannot go back, but ALWAYS FORWARD.  SPARKLE ON
YESSSSSSSSSS

Shane I'm loving you're back, especially with this format of video.
Morgan is GLOWinnnggg😍😍😍
Having Shane back feels like the song from when Jack comes back to Halloween town safety after his Christmas hijinx and I love it 💖

Annoying orange was gone
This is going to be so amazing !!!!
Shane you're such an amazing creator. I love you bitch ❤
I'm a simple person. Shane uploads, I forget about the assignment I have due and watch.
Me waiting until my kids go to bed to watch Shane so I can completely focus on his video because I’ve missed him so much.
grandma is so precious 😭😭😭
Was hoping to actually hear Shane talk about the ghosts in this video but oh well 😂🤷
Feels good to be watching new Shane videos again ❤️
Ryland: “grandma are you coming ghost hunting with us?!”  Grandma: “huh”
Shane we really needed this!!! Welcome back❤️❤️
i used to live right next to where the sand creek massacre happened. Very interesting stories and a very tragic history.
Shane you have no idea how happy your videos make me I'm so glad that you're making YouTube videos again
hold on lemme get comfortable
I do not claim any negative energy from this video 🥰
So good to have you back!!!!!
Omg Shane I missed you so fucking much❤
I missed the camera mama laugh more than anything lol
I really missed videos from Shane! So excited he’s posting again and doing good! ❤️❤️
Bruce is not the main character.. Bruce is that extremely CRUCIAL side character that is freaking REAL and hilarious and nothing would be balanced without him 😂. WE STAN BRUCE
Shane is the ice-cream cake and Ryland , Morgan and there family are the frosting and milk! I love yall from Texas!
It brings back so many memories of watching Shane's theory videos, I'm happy that he's back doing these again
The editing on this was incredible with all the different news clips telling the backstory. This made my whole week and I can’t wait to see the finale. I’m so happy you’re back, Shane. ❤️❤️❤️
That tik Tok challenging got way to out of hand... it was actually sad
Okay to be fair I don’t know all of the drama involving Shane but I do know it somewhat had to deal with some jokes he made YEARS ago(I’ll be fair and say some of them where questionable at the very least) but it’s nice to see Shane is back just in time for my final year of HS can wait for future uploads :)
Poor Shane you can tell he’s scared to say things cause he doesn’t want to get canceled , it’s sucks that he needs to walk on eggshells
Omg the whole thing about vandalism. We had incidents of this at my school in Indiana😬😅
Shane we need part three!!! Please post it! 😩
SHANE ive been watching you from the beginning and I adore you. I am so happy to see you again. Thank you for all the joy you have given me. Ive always watch rylands videos just in case you were there.... but i adore ryland too!!! dream team. I LOVE YALL. thank you for giving an example of what love is.
"Is grandma coming?" .... well she wouldn't hear them coming ☠😭🤣
I will say this, nobody can build suspense on YouTube quiet like you 😱   I chewed my nails through this entire video, jonesing for part 3 already. Granny was smart to stay home, I'm scared already.    So happy you're back, missed you ❤
This is the content we've been waiting for!🥰
Ok, I 100% need Vicki’s monitor set up. I’m in software development. Pls. Share Mama Adams!

Freaking LOVED this ! So happy to see. @Shane back  in action and feeling  good.  Watching while Enjoying  my Texas roadhouse  rolls with cinna butter. 💣👌🤣👍
I really enjoyed that, Shane. I missed your haunted videos, you're so good at them!
Love the video !!! I wished it was longer tho
I've been checking my notifications every day waiting for part 2! Sooooooo much love for Shane and so happy to see him back at it💜
all my happiness is coming back now that shane is posting again
I can see you becoming huge.. like Tim burton.. your work is jaw dropping good!!
loving rylans dad
3rd bridge is actually the fourth bridge you encounter, after the actual 3rd bridge you see along the dirt road.
Haha look at all these terrible people (minus Morgan)
Dude, we have missed you so much!! You have such a bright and kind energy
Been here since 2007. Staying here forever!
You should visit a Mcdonald's for your next trip!  i've heard a lot of spooky things happen in their bathrooms. especially during family roadtrips 😰
What a stupid thing to do vandalizing bathrooms 🚽 when there is such serious supply issues at the port’s.
Truly happy to see you all again ❤️
Ryland’s dad is the star of this
I love that this is in October
Omg seeing you all together😍 I have missed your content SO much! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Y’all are just as bad for supporting him  Like he’s not that entertaining for y’all to be dickriding him like this
Hi
i missed these videos so much glad to have you back shane :))))
I like how the ad was a scream 5 ad lol
Morgan is looking so beautiful! Shine on, girl!
The way that this was edited reminds me of paranormal activity and I LOVE it. Great work.😁
Realising the reason I'm not followed by gohsts is because I just don't have the energy
Awesome video!
My great grandma was 1 of 4 kids. She had 1 older bother and 2 older sisters that were twins. She use to tall me all the time about a little boy and girl that ran around playing in her house. She was old so I just thought maybe she was confused and it was actually her grandkids playing. But then when the 2nd twin died like a month later my grandma said there were 2 little blonde girls playing and 1 boy. She never seen them straight on just in corner of her eyes and could her laughter and they would say her name too. One day she was watching TV and she said the boy stood directly in front of the television and my GMA realized it was her brother and her sisters, waiting for her. Another time maybe a week before gma died she was in her room and the family could hear her speaking to our great grandpa who had been gone for almost 15 years, grandma said to him, when are you gonna come get me, I miss you and am ready to see you. Was the sweetest beautiful thing but so so sad and emotional too  But he always said he would be there waiting for her to help her walk over the bridge. I know today they are together again
Editing. The skills. I aspire to be as great at editing as these videos present. It always blows my mind! I wish part 3 wasn't so far off.
I have no idea what’s going on like these vids are chaotic but I’m here for it ?! Lollll
Out of every fucking place you could go you chose something so devastating. You had a choice and you chose something disgusting. Filming, making jokes, knowing this bridge is linked to a fucking mass murder tragedy is so sad. I can not believe the image you are giving these victims; dangerous spirits that break down cars and cause death. In no way is it even respectful to go looking to aggravate these spirits, let alone record the experience AND make profit off of it. Honestly, not surprised.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SHANE
Seeing these videos pop up on my suggested again after months makes me so happy <3
Shane has sure been engaged a long time. When is the wedding 🛎 going to ring for you?
Yessss uploads
I hate things that scare me but I love watching shane
The new profile pic is super cool looks like not alot of work put into it but still simple and epic stay awesome shane thanks for taking us all on another awesome adventure with you!
i missed your family so MUUUUUUUUCH <3
I dont like Ryalands family in this vibe....
My uncle used to take me to Cheesman Park and let me tell you. It isn't the field that is scary it is the path that is across the street from the park. A lot of weird things have happened to me there. My uncle's dog was barking at a squirrel and randomly got really calm and stopped (that has NEVER happened before). Also, something just feels off there like people are breathing down your neck.
You have no idea how much I needed this today
Morgan describing her mom entering her room is basically every white Colorado mom ever
I LOVE SHANES LAUGH AT 33:12 😭😭😭
More more more
bro, watch all the tea channels flame shane for the grandma joke right at the end of the vid smh lol
:/
"I'm just a big ole white man that wants to show the creepy spookies"   omg I died! missed this so much
THIS IS WHAT I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!! ❤️🙌🏽
I missed you so much thank you for uploading again
Love the series! So nice to see you back Shane!
"...like ghosts, demons...me..." lmfao Rylaaaand
tis the season for Shane! 🖤🎃 so happy to have you back :,)❤️
I loooooove that one of your ads was the new Scream movie
T.T I need moreee
Legit pulled the car over to watch this 👀😆
I get that people like rylands mom don’t believe in the paranormal, but you should never ever take things from places that are on native land or anywhere haunted. It’s disrespectful.
**shane Dawson uploaded a video** **everyone liked that** ❤️❤️
I missed these type of videos. I remember always watching your conspiracy videos as soon as you uploaded them. I’m so glad you are back!
Excited for Part 3!
i got chills
honestly living off ryland and shanes recent videos im obsessed
Bag of chips/dark room/Shane on the tv. That’s a good night. Your vids are like a tv episode it’s so cool
Omg omg omg !!!!!!!
1. morgan looks gorgeous, she looks so much happier and confident now that shes left LA. 2. Who's chris?
devious licks were funny at first, but then it just got out of hand. went from small fun things to people trying to one up each other, to just pure destruction.
Idk if it’s just me but I think you can hear a kid say “hello”  around 2:38
I’ve been so ready for you to be back I’m so excited
This is so well edited and put together... really a work of art. I'm so happy you're back!!!
Shane. Really i was waiting for the real stuff to happen in this episode ughhhh now I have to wait for the NEXT EPISODE
Ugh give me more!
I love ghost stories and I'm readdddy

I’m so glad you’re doing better Shane, I can tell you have changed into a better person !!
Bruce is great  *Nurse nurse!" What happened?! "Idk I was in science class and my penis caught on fire"  I laughed way too hard at that
There aren’t any haunted farmhouses in Colorado.
#family
We love you Shane❤️❤️
Rylands dad coming for my home state 🤣😅
I missed these so much!! Thank you for having the strength to keep going and come back <3  collaborating with Kendall rae would be awesome. Rylands grandma is the best.
Ok next up: Conspiracy videos pls,ive watched all the old ones about 1000 times. anyways love you Shane this series is so fucking good <3
Imagine a channel where Rylands dad just teaches us stuff that’s useful in life??!
I’ve watched Shane for years. Since middle school and I’m 26 now. I’m so happy he came back and didn’t give up. Welcome back, Shane!
the movie poltergeist is also based off of a subdivision near houston  crosby texas in a subdivision there was a slave plantation and where the subdivision is is where the slaves were buried and then years later houses were built on top of them  when houses were built and they would dig pools many bodies were dug up  i live in this subdivision and we have felt and seen many things it is called the black hope curse if you’re interested
THE KING OF YOUTUBE IS BACK!!!!
man I love his vids, glad they're back !
I was just thinking about that old video where Shane looked at a disc with his old high school videos on them, was looking for it, then realized he just uploaded. Didn't know he was back. Also, if someone has that video, link it please.
my life is so much better with you back in it
This story is so sad ☹️ This reminds me of when I went to The Beast of Bray rd in Wisconsin and rode my bike down the road, we made it a video, if anyone wants to check it out feel free, it was super spooky 😅😅
The huge face in the thumbnail was funny :)
So happy to have you back I missed you
Oh I'm still subbed thanks for reminding me
I missed this so much. Watching Shane's videos always helped reduce my anxiety.
Chocolate, coffee in my Shane tumbler, wearing my Shane robe and kickin back on my day off, enjoying episode 2 of Shane's new series. No one makes docos like you do Shane!

Shane We love the new videos 😩
Another great video! I’m excited for part 3 😄
I'm so happy you are back!!
from what I heard about your haunting from that one girl; I was also haunted by him. I called him the top hat man and id look it up for anyone interested in that stuff but definitely don’t mess with him.
Ok FIRST OF ALL: hi welcome back.  SECONDLY: welcome to Colorado from a born and bread Coloradan!
okay but morgan is so gorgeous
This actually made me very sad.  Those poor Native Americans, so peaceful, so earthbound....and they just offed them. It's so disgusting and sad :'(
The tiktok thing is dumb it happened at my school. We have 5 boys bathrooms and they locked them and now the boys have one cause they kept doing it. With the soap dispensers and toilet paper.
Omar! That must have been an older video clip, y'all should colab my two favorite YouTubers!
There’s a cemetery turned park in Whittier CA near turnbull canyon.  it still has some bodies.
I. Miss. King. Supers. So. Damn. Much! 😭
Bruce is in the know. Squash the influencers!!!! California is toxic!!!!! Electrocute all the penis’!!!!!

I missed Shane so much. Didn’t know I was missing a part of my weekly routine until this series.
Take a shot each time Morgan says "So"
I’ve been waiting for Shane to come back!! I love these videos/documentaries so much. It’s edited so well and makes me keep wanting the next video. ❤️
Alright! Time to see what Nick DiRamio is gonna be talking about

Nothing like getting some good food and watching one of my favorite people in the world!!!
As a teacher I’ve never felt so supported than I do by Bruce rn
Grandma may be the cutest thing EVER. 🤣
Just love that a sudder ad came before the vid ❤❤❤ they know where shane is headed 😉
I’ve been watching Shane since 2008. It’s been amazing and truly a privilege to see the growth in himself & his videos. Im so happy for him. Keep up the good work, Shane. Im looking forward to everything you have in store for us. 💖
I remember telling ur theories to my 4th grade friends and they were so confused especially about the Illuminati Reptiles theories 💀 God bless their souls
Loved Morgan’s part but this was so much filler. Cut it down or fill it with more entertainment
I FORGOT YOU WAS POSTING TODAY AND IM SI GALD I WENT ON YOUTUBE 😭
Love love love it ,the only slightly off putting thing is the shaky camera but great work otherwise
WOOO WHO IS READY FOR NIGHTMARES BECAUSE IMA BOUT TO GO TO SLEEP AFTER THIS WOOOOOOOOOOO

I missed Shane so much!!! Not only his content, but actually to get to see him on screen.
I’m so glad you came back with this series
I really enjoy Rylands family especially grandma
I missed you Shane! Love you and Ryland!
yes i have waiting so long
can we take a second to talk about how stunning Morgan is?
YES YES YES !!!
I don’t care what anyone says. I missed Shane and watching new videos feels so nostalgic to me💗🥺
Hector watching this 👁👄👁
Someone even likes this guy anymore?
love the squad
Fuck i would take a serie on Ryan’s dad, he’s hilarious
Dad...Please pet the other dog!
ive missed shane vids tbh
I love Morgan energy 😩 wish I could date her but I’m probably not her type
how the hell does this man still have a fanbase??
WoW OmarGosh CONGRATULATIONS YOU MADE IT IN SHANE'S VIDEO  HOW EXCITING 😘👍👍🤩🐓
Welcome back, we've missed you!!
Anxiously awaiting pt 3.
THE SCARY VIBES ARE BACK
This is what was missing in my life
Do a ouija board
Shane and annoying Orange coming back
MORGAN LOOKS SO GOOD
Missed🥺
Grandma is a national treasure that needs protecting, she's just too precious
So happy shane is back!!! Life is complete now!!!
YES ILYSM SHANE SO GLAD UR BACK AND UR LITERALLY SO PRETTY STOPP
Who would have guessed we’d have to wait until the third part for any entertainment… 🙄 make that money honey. We deserved something better for sticking by and waiting Shane
Woooo! Second part!
Missed this amazing editing spooky/silly!!!! Couldn't wait for this! Rylands grandma is  so precious!!
Me who just moved to Colorado👁👄👁
I just wanna say, I’m proud that he didn’t let the Internet discourage him and he continued on. There will always be those who say “he just came back, there was no growth, he didn’t acknowledge anything etc”   All I have to say is: him moving, him seeking a therapist, him no longer running, is growth. These videos showed growth, and it’s those who already have a biased opinion that will decipher everything he says from now on and try to prove the opposite. I will forever enjoy Shane’s content and those who enjoy it also it does not make you a bad person. Being in Colorado I can see how humble and healthy all of them are and those who don’t see that have a negative view of these amazing people in there minds and it isn’t changing.  My point; I still enjoy his content and it doesn’t make me a bad person.
shane should do the tesla ghost thing where the tesla can sense spirits
my life is now complete!!! Shane is back!!!😭😭❤️❤️
Just in time for spooky season! 👻
I got my notification Shane uploaded and got in my car to get panda express to watch this😙
Thank you for shining light on the massacre. It’s so important they’re remembered and the atrocities never forgotten 💙
Shane i’m so happy that you’re back!! this series is just what i needed this spooky season!! i can’t wait for part 3!!!!👻💜
Omg I can’t wait for the final episode. So glad you are back Shane!
y'all makin devious licks look scary 💀💀💀💀
AAAAAH WEVE MISSED U SO MUCH THO
Keep it up Shane I love your videos pls never quit again
Why do I feel guilty for liking this series?
Omg cannot wait for the next one!!!! He is back praise the Lord!!!! Love you Shane!!!
When shane upload I stop whatever the fuck im doing and find a comfortable position HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
I’m so happy Shane is finally uploading again <3
It's funny, I've always thought Colorado was a bit sketch. I listen and watch so many true crime documentaries and podcasts and I had noticed there is a considerable amount of cases for that state, so many seems to be set there.
Shane I am so happy to see you’re back. I’ve been subscribed to you since your early days. I am sorry about the cancel culture that happened to you. Absolutely asinine. All of your earlier videos you should never be ashamed of. You were a comedian having a good time. I am sad you felt like you had to get rid of them because of cancel culture! Don’t ever allow these people to shame you of your great past videos and your future content! I’m so glad you’re back. ❤️ Shaniqua was my favorite character back in the day!
I work for a landscaping company in CO and we did some digging and dug up human bones. So yeah thats real. Congrats Shane on your return. Always looking forward to your videos:)
💜💜💜💜💜
Yes the ghost are back baby hell yeah!!!!!
Why do they blurr out the face of the dude whos family got killed? Will they reveal he looks like shane or what?
Love love love!!!!
I missed you shane!!!
So pleased Shane is back. Let's get jenna back next please.
So excited you're back. I've been watching you since I was in the 4th or 5th grade and now I'm 21. So over half my life. 🖤🖤🖤
this is amazing, shane & the editing is better than ever! good job & welcome back! :)
omggg delete ur chanel
Bruce came alive in this video with facts and laughs 😂
18:37 I CANT
Welcome back Shane, I hope you're doing well. This series is giving me such a good feeling, ive missed your videos. Thank you 💜
“I feel like Kendall Rae” BRUH I FUCKIN DEAD WHEN MORGAN SAID THAT!!!!😂😂😂😂
17:06 i feel a lot of people have this spirit with them. My mom has always seen him when she was younger outside her window on the street & still does see him to this day.  She says she knows he’s not bad, that he’s there protecting her somewhat like a guardian angel. I do believe I’ve seen him once when i was little.  I know a few people that seen this type of spirit with them but it always seem to be a bit older people that have him?
😊❤️❤️❤️
So glad you are back. I missed your videos! Love ya Shane!!
I’m so glad you’re back to posting Shane!
I’ll date you Morgan ❤️
I casually searched shane to watch his old videos and wtf.Yay he's back hohooooo!
So happy you're out of LA! It makes me happy to see you happy
Omg not Ryland casually talking about his manipulation of women for men's sexual pleasure😶
SHANES BACK!???? Last thing I was expecting today
I love that you add that little extra scene at the end. It has chill elevator music and a little comedy. It’s like how when you watch something scary you have to watch something funny before bed. 😍
Don't care what anyone says. Shane Dawson will always be the best.
I dont want any of this bad energy. Stay back spirits.
LMAOOOO I love Ryland's dad bro. You can tell he was serious too! 7:26
ME HITTING LIKE BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
These videos are so damn good. I wish they were hours long
I hate this fuck but I’ve lowkey missed his videos
When they all started saying "Im not gonna die" and then chris said "i will" i literally laughedd so hard im sorry but chris in this group is the type of character who would die first in a horror movie
I’m loving this series so much! It’s so well done and so comforting at the same time❤️
Rylands family needs their own reality show! 😂🤣
His "spooky" videos have never once been the slightest bit scary lol
OMG WELCOME BACK
MORGAN IS GLOWING
Watching your videos is so comforting 🥺 spooky or not<3
Love that the whole family is part of this video. Morgan is so relatable and Shane you and Ryland are awesome!
Just absolutely love you Shane!! So glad your back and producing such incredible work. Should be proud of yourself!! I know we all are ❤️ Sending love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 xx
GUYS STOP SUPPORTING HIM HE LITERALLY DID BLACK FACE 🤮🤮
Yayyyy shane is back!!! Time to put off my homework!!
I feel insanely good now that Shane is back😩❤
Just called my best friend screaming about how you posted, we were both so excited. Good to have you back Shane, you’ve been missed.
I feel like I've been given so much information that's not even connected to third Bridge. So I just feel a little bit confused😕
Welcome back Shane... We missed you
"The people who could afford it were moved first, so the people who were left were just criminals and bad people." Anyone find issue with this quote?
Happy your back Shane! 👍
No wonder I’ve always had a little voice in my head telling me to stay the fuck away 🥲
I’ve been waiting ❤️
Morgan is just getting more and more gorgeous! You go girl!
This series is giving me life ❤️
@Shane you've been missed! Lub you!
Words can’t express how happy I am right now that Shane is back. Never stopped loving u boo. Also I love Rylands family! Morgan is stunning!   We missed you too Shane. Ur humor and editing and story telling is unmatched!!!!! Can’t wait for part 3!
Ryland’s mom def has a crush on Chris
I am sooooo glad you're back!!!!!
So happy you’re back ❤️ thanks for blessing my day!
YES OMG I am reasy
I want one of the ghosts to bust it down like Thotiana
I swear i always find myself saying out loud when i click on a new Shane video.. "Please be a long one please be a long one!" Love your videos so much.. They're so much different and on another level then any other creator!
Yes Kendall Rae is QUEEN 👑
cheese?
Oommgg iimm ssoo hhaappiiee shane is postiing again an agaaiinn yessssssssss heeyyy grroouuppiieess
34:50 wow did not expect that  I almost fell of my bed 😂
Chris and Shane have the same "long" laugh
sooooo are we all just forgetting the sexual comments he made about an underage girl as a "joke"? we're just cool with that now? yikes.
Finally thanks Shane
Missed you soooo much🥺❤️
Thank you so much for coming back to share your talent with us ❤️
I love this series so much every episode keeps you on edge!!! You're amazing Shane!!!💜💜💜
Them talking about schools being vandalised in America, whilst I'm just sat here in the Uk being like 'Wait your schools don't always look like that normally? Mine usually always does.' 🤥💀
WHY is everyone leaving us on cliffhangers?!?!? I can't take it 😫
Someone give Bruce, Ryland's dad, a huge hug for getting the past tense of the word hang in the context of ending a life with a rope. It is hanged  not hung, thank you Bruce 🙏
🙌 🙌
My love for Bruce grows and grows the more he’s in the videos 😂 “my Penis caught on fire” 😂
shane i'm happy you're back 🙏❤
This was fantastic!!! Dad was on point for jokes!!! And Shane it’s so nice to see you again I love you guys altogether!!!! Ryland Morgan Mom Dad grandma you guys are the best…. Family 🖤
Can we get a shirt with a picture of Rylands dad holding the dog & it saying “I think California is very toxic” ??? 😂😂💀💀
I can’t get enough of shaneeeeee
Yay!!!! WELCOME BACK SHANE!!!!! We missed you SO SO SO SO MUCH!!!! 🤗🤗🤗.....  This happened literally ALL over the US. It’s how the European’s colonized the US is by slaughtering Native Americans and then forcing the rest of my people who weren’t slaughtered onto reservations. US History is extremely dark and school texts books are rarely accurate.
Yay!
2018 morgan vs 2021 morgan such a difference XD 16:04 I dont think she will be alone for ever to cute for that XD but then again its been 3 years 0.0 lol jk that is not long time of being single she probably was not even single this whole time XD
As an indigenous person, the first time I heard about the sand creek massacre I bawled my eyes out. The story is really tragic and I appreciate Morgan doing her research
Shane, I’m SO HAPPY that you’re back! 😩😩😭😭👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
better than a Netflix documentary
Do anybody know at all if the old lady got driver's license?
Morgan is looking so GOOD, she looks really happy too!!
Now this is what Shane is supposed to be doing 💯
Why is rylands dad so mad about the kids tearing up the schools 😂 does he work at the schools or is he in high school or like what’s the deal 😂 he’s taking it real personally
Bruce is sending me--
Man great having you back Shane and I also learn crazy history thank you keep doing you
I have been dying waiting for you to come back 😭😍😍😍❤️
Im so happy shanes learning about the area ! He looks so happy, im excited hes backk
Me: washing dishes Me: hears notification on phone and glances at screen Me: sees that Shane uploaded part 2 Me: literally drops the bowl and sponge in the sink  Me: shuts off the water and furiously dries her hands Me: trips over herself running to her room to watch on the PC I AM SO. FUCKING. HERE. FOR THIS. YAAAS SHANE! Really hope this is just the first 3 parts of like a 30 part anthology BTW.
ok but i missed this…
Love you and missed you sooooooooo much!!!!
❤️ you Shane and glad you back.😊
I'll watch this after I'm done my work  ily Shane <3
I am in love with this series!  👏🏻Also, rylands grandma is a queen and an icon 👑
Morgan is soooo pretty, she looks so happy 🥲
🎃🎥🍿
Nooooo I have an exam coming up!  I was hoping you would upload this after my exam. I guess I’ll fail now.
Ryland's dad is so adorable 😭😂
OMG please collab with Kendall Rae
I watch omar sometimes. I was really hoping this episode would have a little bit of the ghost hunting going on, dang it. I'm way too impatient!
Thanks Shane, it’s 2PM and now I can’t sleep! :(
“I just want to show the creepy spookies! 😱 😅”
Shane you’re soul food 🥘 don’t you ever go again ♥️
My world is so much better now that Shane is back!
Rylands family is so warm and friendly, Shane literally deserves all of it. Weve waited with our fingers crossed for years for Shane to come back, and I’m so so happy we have him just in time for Halloween 🎃 and Christmas 🎄
maybe a 3 part doc on the native women that go missing across Canada and the U
Morgan is so pretty
Morgan looks gorgeous!  Love being able to look forward to a Shane video! ❤️
Bruce is hilarious!!!
YESSS SHANE I LOVE YOU
I miss the old conspiracy theories videos. Like 911, Aliens, government coverups, weirdly shaped pizzas, MIB.  But it’s cool that he’s getting back with this kind of videos.  Hope to see more of it and less of makeups.  Welcome back, Shane!
« I don’t wish harm on anybody BUT I hope the little shit who’s taking a piss… » 💀
Love having you back Shane
Woohooo! A video to watch with some starbucks while it's raining 🌧
this series is good soo far cant wait for part 3
We miss you ❤️
So y’all just gonna forgive him 🤔🤨
Shane: “I hope i don’t die”  Grandma Janice: “yeah”  pls i love her💀
As a Denver native tht park not hunted it’s where I go to smoke my blunts
YOUR BACK
In high school, a few friends and I were going to go to a haunted place on top of a mountain near us.  Thank god plans fell through because there was a shooting there that night over drugs.
Oh I have missed this
So happy to see you back Shane ☺️
It feels like 2018 and all is right with the world again. Very much enjoyed this and please please please do more explorations!!
talk a cliffhanger come on Shane. also, shanes  arms look amazing
OMG Cheesman Park! Yesssss.
i love shane but chris needs a fucking inhaler and a chill pill
I have missed these videos so much. The  editing is awesome!
YAY SHANE IS BACK YALL
E
I love Rylands dad😩 hes so on top of trends sdljadlLJAFJLAJAH
That dad is such a loser. Buddy cares way too much about his job. Who gives a f about soap dispensers.
I love horror shows… I love Shane… PERFECT!!!!
I went to that park with my Polaroid camera and got an orb mid day
Oh my God. I love this man!!! I get to sleep then once I wake up on my own I see he uploads, and a ghost video, and with Morgan! God is playing with me
Some years ago I went with a group of friends we parked in the middle of the bridge turned off the car and one of the boys kept trying to scare us at some point he said “ I hope one of our tires pops”  mind you we never left the car . we later tried to leave and what do you know we had a flat !!! We drove off and made it to a gas station had to call someone to bring us an extra lol but that was scary !
27:27 i died so hard laughing! great video shane! so happy u are back in the game love you so much!
Mmmkkk so I see ryland has the wedding band now! 👀 ❤️  So excited for this series! 👻 I live in West Tx no damn pump jack sounds like that.
Morgan’s history lesson is everything (and super sad)
Morgan looks gorgeous
I need more of this, thank you
Dear Shane Thank you so much for your upload!!!  Thank you so much for not giving up. Thank you so much for taking the time to feel and start to heal. And thank you for not just going away from this platform, because.. I wouldn't blame you at this point.  People treated you worse than someone who has done literally worse. Everyone has a past and like you said last time, you already had your turn to apologize and took the chance to change and to grow.  Why people felt the need to put you through this again but ten times worse. I just don't know.  You are an unique creator, one of a kind and we all can be really happy to have you back. Seriously, Youtube is an empty and colorless place without your creations. I appreciate you being here so, so freaking much!!  I wish for you that you can heal and forgive. Your life is so important and I am so happy you and your loved ones are doing well.  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to this.. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart!!!  Much love and many hugs from Croatia 💖
Morgan looks amazing. Shane looks more relaxed and I’m LOVING it. Shane we missed you so much! It’s comforting to see uploads from him! 🥰🥰🥰
Awesome, ready for it
Ryland's dad is seriously passionate about catching these toilet  bandits
Shane if U see this, turns out I did go to school, BUT don’t worry I finished the video before I went so. ALSO I finished this video too and I love it I’m so exited for part 3. Also pls don’t die xoxo 🤍
I waited so long for this. I am so happy you are back. It’s a level of comfort I forgot how much I appreciated. You make me feel good in my own company. Thanks for your help and great content
Woohoo great to see yet another video by Shane glad he's back we missed him
bruce just letting it ALLLL it is everything 😂 he doesn’t give any f’s
is anyone else bored watching these videos, seems like the same old stuff ....
Wait Morgan’s back at home? I thought she bought a house
Yes yes yes I was so excited to see this notification YAAAAAAS
My heart just skipped a beat this man actually posted 💓
The tick tock bs the parents should have to pay for what they're kids tear up in the schools. Hope you all were safe.  Spirits can attach themselves to you. It's not good mojo to mess with stuff like this.  I hope you cleansed yourselves when you were done.
I want more!
They said Shane can you squash the tik tok thing 🤣
Shane: “I hope I don’t die”  Grandma: “….yeah”  I died 😂😂☠️
I can't wait  to see the final SHANE! I'm so excited you're back! :) YAY!
And you are right almost all bad murders you hear about come from Colorado Ohio California and Tex’s Arizona
And why does Rayland's dad care so much about the school bathroom. If they they are dumb enough to destroyed the bathroom then no more bathroom privileges and kids can't escape to the bathroom for any reason. Like if they need a break away, to skip class, visit friends, or whatever now the kids have no reason to leave the classroom more learning for them. Or make them use a Porta-Potty I bet they would make them stop lol Also it's on tiktok and I'm pretty sure in 2021 school have cameras as well kids are dumb and they do the dumbest ish on the regular, I know cuz we all have been there lol if they really wanted to find out who's doing what the can easily find out
Love that the new scream trailer was an ad on this video
my bathrooms were so messed up too they were all closed
I hollered at "I'll save you, Chris" lol
Now I adore every single person in Rylands family but he’s Dad is my favorite!!! They genuinely seem like the family every single person could get along with that they are just loving period!
If my history tearcher taught like this I swore I would have passed
The civil war was supposed to be a distraction from this
ghosties time :D
Interested to know what Rylands Mum does for work
I’m so freaking happy to be watching a Shane series again!! I’m sorry but he is the VERY BEST at what he does. I get depressed when it’s over. Just glad your back! FINALLY something worth watching. Kudos Shane!!!! 👊🏼
at least i can flex that i been in a shane dawson video😭😭 5:19
YT really needs to work on its spam comments omg
omg that park that used to be a graveyard and there is still bodies there poltergeist much ----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh_W6FLaMvA
Love love love this episode! I cannot wait until next week.
YES I LOVE THESE VIDEOSS!!!
Need it to be longer!!!! (The video)
Kendall Rae is the best!!!!!!!
IVE MISSED YOU BYE
So excited! Btw the dark red text on black background make it really difficult to read
Ok.  Chris needs to do something about that laugh.. lol
Exactly why I’m being CREMATED 👍🏽
Come to Pennsylvania and go to Gettysburg at night. You wanna see some scary shit go there. I love you Shane.
I cant just see this notification and watch it. I first get snacks and turn on that smart tv on. Relaxing time
the amount of times morgan says keke in this video is insane😂😂
Had to watch the last video before this. Popcorn anyone?
OMG what a teeeeeeeeeeease! 😱
Seriously Shane! This tik tok shit needs to stop. My daughter's school had to send emails home about it and now kids can't use the bathrooms! Use your platform and try to reach these idiots
I’m sorry but the camera guy is so shit GET A NEW CAMERA MAN
This is SO GOOD I can’t wait for the final!
I haven't clicked so fast in months!!
I just took 4 exams back to back😫 I needed this video drop🥺🥺🥺❤️
YESSSSSSSSSS
"oou it's dead.. like the massacre victims"  omg 😂😂😂😂
Man I miss me some Shane Dawson……hopefully you’ll keep the videos coming and I hope that all of y’all r alright and happy.
free morgan‼️ shes being held hostage😒
You guys should totally go to Cheeseman Park! That's one of the creepiest true stories I've ever heard.
FUCK YEAH SHANE WOOHOOO
How else got scream for their ad 👻👻
I'm so glad to see Shane uploading again. I've missed him so much!
That guy who licked the battery got me LOL.
man I kinda feel like this episode was just total filler 😬
I love you guys being back with rylands fam, so sweet and happy ❤ cant wait for the finale!
Your haunted content has always been the BEST! I'm ecstatic for this!
This is exactly what I needed
hey I have a Boston terrier too🥰
Love your videos so much and I'm so happy that you came back to YouTube ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👑👑👑👑👑
Yessss I’ve been waitingggg
This guy is so talented man. He’s a YouTube legend regardless of whatever happened, idrk what happened tbh. He used to break the internet after every upload.
In England, we have “commons”. Common grounds that are like this park. Lots of them, not all,  have the bodies of plague victims, and other long ago pandemic victims, buried there.
Nice! Shane is back :D
What movie is referenced in this video? Wanna watch!
Can Ryland’s Dad please start his own channel?? ☺️☺️☺️
Grandma is a viiiiiiiibe 😂
Perfect way to start my night with a drink watching Shane love that he’s back I was waiting for this🥰🥰
aww i missed u
Shaneee your back 🤧😊😊😊 I missed you!!
Omg Shane is back yahoo. Cant wait to see what you have in store for us. I love that your whole family is involved. Now you just need to get your mom out to di videos as well.   All jokes aside I for one have been waiting for you to come back Shane I am proud of you Shane.  This must have not been easy but  the future looks brighter now.  Please stay safe and take care your fan Michelle from Canada 🇨🇦
WB Shane!!!❤❤❤
Shane, Ryland, Morgan, Chris, & Lizzie plus Ryland family.... most comforting videos to watch for good vibes.
This is the best thing 2021 has to brought me, nothing tops this - SHANE IS BACK!!! 🤴🏼
SO GOOD!!!!! We are so glad you’re back Shane!!!!
I cant get over how excited I am that shane is making videos again!
Dammit I knew the music in the end was too chill
make longer videos, I´m obsessed!
i’m so glad ur back
I just got home drunk from the bar and i’m watching Shane 2021 is wild
And life feels okay again😌
chris’s laugh is so annoying, even rylands mom asked him to stop laughing the colorado way
I'm so happy Shane is back! I'm living for this!
Shane you are meant to do these spooky videos forever!!! Pls never stop 🥰
Rylands dad is funny af & doesn’t even try
Morgan saying how everyone gets murdered there but didnt she must buy a house out in the country lol
Wait. … Morgan… you are so freaking beautiful like.. wowowow SOMEONE WAS BLESSED… ☺️😆🥲
They did that to our school on tiktok its disgusting
Can we talk about how I've been waiting for Shane and then he's back and Im so happy. And now each week the wait between these videos feels longer then he was gone. I just missed him so EFFING much. He makes shit I like. I don't like many youtubers. I have only ever got merch from Shane and Colleen. But I love hoodies so that's my thing.
I just wanted to say I love you Shane 💓
Missed you Shane
Finally something worth watching. Im here for it.
Such suspense for next episode! Ahhhhhh can't wait !
I recently just moved to Colorado with my family and its crazy to know you live here too!!! Any future haunted places you go to im totally gonna try to visit with friends
❤️
How come the photo of that guy is blurred out? It’s an old, old photo so I can’t figure out what the anonymity is for.
Yassssss 👏👏👏👏 Hercules Hercules Hercules 😂
The horror music and dramatic as fucc “justice will be swift” news broadcasts over some silly kid vandalism videos was goddamn hilarious. Toilet paper on the flooooor?????? Ketchup on the tOliEtS???? Who darrrrrre????? The horror!!!!!!! THE HORROR!!! Lock ‘em up, knock ‘em dead....electrocute their ballllllsssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im not even scared im just intrigued by this story like omg
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE DEVIOUS LICKS 🤣🤣🤣🤣 THEY DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT ITS CALLED
Loving these ..... What a sweet family im loving these more and more and grandma so sweet ..
Please do not support Last Frontier Medium, she was against BLM.
Omg so excited for you and everything to come ! These are my favourite videos you make but I love them all but these are just what I like scary and real stuff have happened to know the history too . I hope the 3rd part doesn’t take long to come out !
didn’t expect this but i don’t mind
I missed the spooky videos so much.
Cannot wait for part 3!!!
5 min in and we out here talking about how Shane might just put a stop to the damn lick trend lmao i laughed for 10 min straight omg
School recently started and causes me so much stress so I’m very happy and excited that Shane’s posting again now I have something interesting to look forward to <3333
I'm so happy you're back ♥️
I missed you I literally stopped what I was doing🦈🙌
Lived in CO my entire life & never knew of the haunted areas in the Denver area! Governor Evans is such a piece of shit had no idea he massacred the natives. My middle school was named after him, but it was destroyed as it should be.
Please just be a spooky channel from now on
So glad you’re back. You have a real talent for editing and making your videos so intriguing 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
i love how seriously adults take tiktok trends 😭 anyways imma go cop another devious lick 😈
Love this Shane 👏🏼 also Morgan is so gorgeous
I love Shane I really Missed his content
Morgan’s HOT
Randonautica documentary next???
I like watching Shane’s videos but I hate how much they get off topic. It makes videos less scary. I don’t mind the comedy but I hate how they just started talking about TikTok
I MISSED HIM SO MUCHHHHH
Great video series Shane 👍🤩
WOOOOOOO
I hate it because I can't just listen to the video in the background. I actually have to drop everything I'm doing for the required time.
did yall forget………..what he did……..what happened………yall a MESS fuck yall im mad at you guys
I have missed you so much!! 😭😭 Thanks for making a video again 🤧🤗😍🥳
i am enjoying every second of this video <3
As a Native American (Navajo/kiawa Apache), that broke my heart when they mentioned the sand creek massacre! St*pid colonizers🤬
Yessss, I missed this shit😁
Moved _most_ of the bodies 😳😳
I'm watching this on my phone, the phone went black and I almost 💩💩 myself because I thought the reflection of my light on my roof was a person's face!!! 😂
I love Morgan. I'm wondering at 1:00 when she was reading that someone saw an  "aspiration" of a ghost girl. I think they meant apparition?
Lived in Colorado my whole life. Used to think my "experiences" were a fluke until my family also started mentioning their same experiences.
"It sounds like native American war."
Okay but why am I not getting the notifications for this even though it’s turned on 😩 is anyone else having this issue?
You're baaackkkk!
Love it!!!!!!!!!
I’m suddenly falling in love with YouTube again. Shane, glad to have you back ❤️❤️!
shane’s backkk
That graveyard turned into a park reminded me this Poppy's lyric: "Bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete turn me into a street"
Please do more series like this. . Can’t wait for the conclusion of this series . I really hope you continue with many more haunted series , you do these better than anyone else .
leave 😐
I'm so excited for the next part! I love your ghost hunting adventures! So glad to have you back, Shane! 💖💖💖
I think any kid destroying school property should be immediately expelled and their families should be sued for the damages. Those fuckers will rot in prison eventually anyway
GOD IM SO FUCKIN HERE FOR THIS COMEBACK YESSSSSS
Morgan is so good at telling stories. Girl you are funny and beautiful! Don’t ever doubt yourself!
Am I the only one loving the two dogs in the video? So, so cute <3
Hes back stronger than ever
Aspiration 😂😂
I want you to hear these drums but let me talk thru 90% of the drums... Smh I mean I heard them but Chris baby shhhh we can't hear it all if u talking boo lol but that's the ONLY thing bad I'd say about Chris or these two vids. Welcome back Shane people fuck up and as someone with a gross too far humor myself at times I get it. But you live you learn you come back better stronger harder and more successful. Show them why tf YOU ARE SHANE DAWSON. Lol sending love and blessings ♥️♥️
There is nothing like a Shane video 🙀love this spooky series 👻 your family cracks me up, I love all of you together. Can't wait for the finale 🎃🖤
I’ve been to Cheeseman park how many times, even took quince pictures there, and I’m just now finding this out????
Funny how he says to not go to third bridge when I’ve been there like 3 times all at night 😭 I didn’t even know what it looked like during the day until now
That girl looks more like Mila Kunis than Mila Kunis
morgan gets hotter everytime i see her omfg
Yesss 🙌🏾 I’ve missed you!! ❤️
Got the notification for this as I was watching "the demon in my house" we have missed you Shane 🖤❤
I'm just here for Morgan
Bruce’s genuine concern with these TikTokers destroying bathrooms is giving me so much life.
I've walked through cheeseman Park and it's horrifying I love it so much  😭
we’ve missed you bestie ❤️❤️ as always so excited to watch
Ok I’m scared… I can’t get passed 26:09 my phone keeps rewinding everytime it gets to that timestamp ummm ima go now thanks Shane loved it but I’m scared hahahahahaha
HES BACK
I have lived in Colorado my entire life and have never heard of the bridge or park! Scary!
How dare YouTube not notify me of this!!! I get like 1,000 notifications a day from them! Good thing Shane made a post of upload time so I knew!!
My uncles house in Ohio is haunted by a lady who lived there before him. He's had friends over in the backyard sitting around a fire who didn't know anything about it look at the window and ask "who's in the house? There was some girl at the window" and a few years ago when my mom and I were staying over she said I sat up in the middle of the night shaking like a leaf pointing at the door saying "do you see her"
Omargosh fakes all his vids
This is such a good series!!
is that all we get??
I missed this
Yesss Shane Love your videos glad your back I need your videos after what happened in 2020🤧🤧😁😁
Why must you tease us
Noooo I know what Morgan means with the trunk thing, just the backmost seat. XD Lots of Subies or Jeeps have a big cargo space, not a separated off like “kidnapper-throws-you-in-back-and-slams-the-hatch” type of trunk lmaooo. I had my first kiss in the “trunk” of a Jeep Cherokee in the parking lot of a trailhead in the mountains lol
Shane we need more content 😅 we missed you
aspiration XD...think they meant apparition
Shane came back just when we needed him 🥺
I literally used to spend my summer Nights looking for haunted places There are so many here in Colorado
OMG I AM SO EXCITED.. Why didn’t I get a notification? Love u so much.. We have missed u too Shane Dawson..
Y'all I can't be the only person who experienced some SERIOUS glitching in the videography throughout the entire video, despite having perfect signal and no issues with wifi. I've even checked to see if it was a YouTube issue and it wasn't, every other video I've watched has no issues. The spirit shit must be serious LOL
I think the trend was called hitting licks or like devious licks. Lick is slang for stealing so it’s just kids doing stupid stuff for tiktok views
When morgan was serious talking about ghost, shane is like joking it’s like killing the mood and situations
Glad your back with new material! I think you guys are so much better off with family in Colorado. Family is most important ✌🏽
I forgot I was going to watch this when it came out but love the video ｡◕‿◕｡
God I love these videos. Shane’s such a good editor and now he’s giving me history lessons. Like I’m learning shit end it’s not just a scary video. Plus how was I gonna know that the annoying orange was back if I didn’t watch this video. 😂
im so happy you are back
Rylands Dad : That electricity is gonna exit ... had me dead asf 😂
This literally feels like I’m watching a movie. I Love it
New series...      Shane gets canceled by the dead 🤣🤣🤣   Love you Shane! Glad you're back
No one makes these videos like you Shane. Love the vibe and thank you!
Not me living right by Cheesman park like 😬😳😅
These videos are what your meant to do . So so entertaining.
💙💙💙💙💙
Thank you for coming back. I feel too happy
I mean I can't even be mad at this...
Yyyeesss
Love you Shane
Morgan is so pretty ❤️
Love you guys!!💖
Finally shane is back with ghosts ❤👍
Who said you can come back?
Never forget what he did 😕   https://youtu.be/K6cM36Cm27U
Does watching the old offensive videos turn my stomach? Yes. Do I make excuses for it? No. Did I just get off work,  see that he uploaded, grab my food, and snuggle in bed to watch? Yes I sure did.
Just cracking open a cold root beer as I click on this video
so happy that you're posting again! hope to see more after this!!
Ugh I love rylands family so much. He is so lucky to have such a beautiful loving family. They really make me feel like I am home. ☺️🤗
The 3 adds i got in the beginning 😩😩😩
Im literally so happy shane is posting again
I'm nervous about him mentioning kendall uhhHhHh
WE BACK
So excited that Shane is back and making great content <3
So glad to see you uploading again.
So can't wait for Part 3! So down when Part 2 ended! I was like "noooooo, I want more Shane" Please don't stop making awesome content EVER AGAIN! 😘😍😎😁
I’m laughing because I also watch H3H3 . I am an unbiased viewer and just enjoy both Shane and Ethan’s content .   Ethan has been debating to choose the name “Bruce” for his un-born son. Come to find out it’s Ryland’s father’s name 🤣   Oh the irony !
A online trend isn’t a trend until boomers freak out and put it on the local news across the country thus giving the same three photos the legs to become replicated.  If kids are looking for attention - maybe giving them front page breaking news status isn’t the cure you think it is?  See tide pods.
I’m just here to see what’s going on
See I like Bailey sarian a lot better than Kendall. I just couldn't get into her story telling. Mr. Ballen is my favorite male story teller for sure. I wish Morgan loved closer to me, id definitely become her best friend. We have the same vibes lol
16:50 I’m sorry if I’m misinterpreting this wrong, but…? “He IS full black…” Sis *please* tell me you meant like a dark shadow figure and not a Black person 🤨   (I haven’t watched whoever that is’s full vid so idk what the context was, but it just doesn’t sound right off the bat)
Haha I called that they were going to thrid bridge
I love you Shane!!!
What a great family, you’re lucky to have them in your life! I am so excited for this series!
Omg them talking about devious licks ….
Can someone please tell Morgan how pretty she is!! OMGGG girl growin' into herself so well
Ie missed you too shane i am very glad your back
if you're waiting for them to actually go somewhere in this video they don't
I work in a HS in California. This is facts. We literally got a work email end of September warning us the next "challenge" for Oct on TikTok was smack a teachers ass.
Welp I’m now terrified 🥲
Anyone know who did the piano music
Omg I love Kendal Rae, a collab would be amazing !!!
Yr back 😍😍
gurl not me hiding In the comments
The guy talking about third bridge and licked the dead battery, that would be Bruce if he started a yt channel.
I think its a made up story so people would bother to learn about them.
So happy you are back!!
Shane's videos>me
Yessss I’m excited for this !
So happy to see Shane again!!
I'm so happy to see shane surrounded by the love and laughter of his family and friends. I can't wait for the next episode! 💕
Just as a general aside, its always horrifying to hear how indigenous people were treated in their own country by colonisers. I'm Australian and our country carries a lot of shame and sounds like America does too.
I love you Shane your bring me life
i hope he keeps uploading this october 😩
I want moooooooore 🖤🥺
Love that you included Omargoshtv! He's the best!
Not Shane posting one hours before ADELE.  I was getting ready 😩🤞🏽
E
Rylands family feels so heartwarming, it feels like home.  ☺️☺️☺️
Nicely done Shane.
Anyways remember to unsubscribe from Shane!
I waited a week for this shit just get in with it
Shane’s comeback has been nothing short of amazing. Got me scared as hell.
Luv you shane so excited your back luv light n respected from bloody Harlan Kentucky.... 👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻     🌹🍷🌹🍷🌹🍷🌻🍷🌹🍷
Am I at work?yes.....but am I about to take my 45 minutes break now to watch this and process....absolutely
OMG his parents are so similar to mine, the mom and dad crack me up ❤️
Kendall would be good to have on the show
I missed Shane so much so glad he’s back
Throws a like makes this comment and runs away screaming cause I'm a shitebag.
You are an amazing human being and I am so glad you're back!!
Morgan’s body is goals asf!! I love you Morgan!!
K...Ryland's grandmother has been featured in videos for quite a while now and I'm getting really sick of them making light of her hearing impairment. They always laugh when she can't hear what's being said or pauses for a long time. It's degrading. Have some respect, it's not even funny anwyway.
Shane posting is the best birthday present <3
Is it just me who wishes Rylan would stay on his own channel? He’s so annoying 😂
can we talk about how GORGEOUS morgan looked here?? she’s literally glowing
Please- I’m literally so exited to watch This
SHANEEEE!!! IM SO FREAKING GLAD YOU ARE BACK MISSED YOU IM TOO EXCITED!!!!
i love you
Kprc channel 2 is Houston tx station. Here to represent 🙋🏻‍♀️
So excited to watch this!
So glad you're back!
There is a place in ? where eve kidbehindacameras place there is a park next to the water in charelston downtown and it is like same story they oofed alot of pirates there makes you wonder what if walking parks where all bad places we still dont know about and that is why cops are sus of people at night at them cause they dont want them to find out truth 0.0
Aspiration do y’all mean apparition?
So happy for another Shane video!! Life is back to Normal!!!!! We love you Shane!!
I couldn’t wait for these videos to come back
I love Bruce’s energy!! HE NEEDS A SPECIAL WITH SHANE!
Oh shhh... There's an episode of dead files of someone who lives not far from there and the medium picked up on and gave details of the dead and how angry they are. Esp one guy... She had him drawn and it's NOT PRETTY...
THANK YOU FOR POSTING SHANE I APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH
Yes yes yes I ABSOLUTELY your father and everything he said about these kids doing this to there school there learning in it’s just not right at all I have two in high school and they both told me how ignorant they thought it was to and sad I love your father and that he stands up for the right thing after the past year we’ve all had I’m sure by now most can see what’s really happening and the truth be the right thing I think we should just vote California off already haha
U better bring a strap out there
Bro Morgan did so good explaining I was so surprised!!! She’s def came a long way. Love to see it 🤍🤍🤍
I adore Shane but I live here and it ain’t no kinda haunted.
Not me setting a timer for when this video will come out haha
guy at 25:30 sounds like frank grillo
Loving this ❤
Nobody will stop the devious licks
OMG ITS HAPPENING ITS HAPPENING! EVERYONE STAY CALM!!
They've been damaging school and stealing things from schools like sinks, it's not just a trend it's cuz of them acting out over everything that's been going on since covid and distance learning and all that
The intro was so confusing/random without any explanation I just skipped the video
I love the parts in the spooky videos where the vibe gets cheery and cozy again.
I'm so glad he's uploading again, I would have forgotten to unsubscribe otherwise
I loooooove that Shane is back. Perfect series to come out just before Halloween
Shane 💕
❤️💕❤️💕❤️
I love this so much!!! I feel like I have earned so much. Also love Shane when Morgan couldn't remember the name. Just shrug his shoulders "idk". Such a me thing to do lol  Love ya Shane keep it up!
Morgan is so gorgeous damn
We’ve missed you too, Shane
Let's hope we actually see some ghost tho
Okay Rylands dad is freaking awesome! Side note omg Morgan is so freaking beautiful.
I love how i only 3 miles away from cheeseman park
So ready for part 3 🙌🏼
Yeeey shane is baaaaack
SooOOoOooOooo unhappy you're back! 🤪

This isn’t where I thought Shane’s channel would go 😂
FInally Something good to watch 🤓
I hope he does a TIKTOK series to investigate the trends, influence and stuff.
I mean... I'll watch anyway but i'm not interested in this kind of paranormal videos thanks
Shane🐷
hype
I am so here for this shit! So glad y’all are back!
I’m so happy you’re back
Morgan: is Grandma comin'? Ryland: she wouldn't hear em coming
Got the Scream trailer ad on this video!!! 🤩
Waited all week for this and it didn’t disappoint 💜❤️
I'm so fucking happy that Shane is back! I dropped everything as soon as I got the notification that part 2 was out!
So excited for the next video!!!
I can’t believe we have to wait another week for the next episode 😩 this is soooo good!!!!!
y’all mfs have post notifications on just to dislike😂y’all secretly fans
Rylands family is so funny!
Bro the only thing i hate is having to wait so long for the next part of the video lol 😭
So happy that Shane has came back I’m just sick of him being cancelled over things from years ago he is one of the greatest youtubers to be on this platform ever. I cant wait for part 3
Ugh I wish I could binge watch this series
God I love spooky season🎃
And peace
Who else thought Hectors full name was Hector Aurora Colorado?
I can't wait to watch this, thanks shane!
Yassssssssssss SHAAAANE WTFFFFFF U UPLOADED THANK GODDDDDDD. FUCKING LOVE U
Morgan is literally breathe taking 😍
we love you shain!
Shane and ryland you should talk to omargoshtv do a haunted adventure with them they go all over 👻
ID WATCH A SHANE VIDEO THAT'S OVER 1 HOUR LONG 🥰
i feel bad for shane’s mom, she must be so lonely now in California. hopefully she will move to Colorado soon to spend her years with shane and ryan and his family
Omgggg yesssssss part 2 i was dead Eager for this part 2 to come already!!!!! 😬😬😬😘😘😘
Nope you dont just get to leave for a few months not address anything and just come back, apologize for what you actually did not the half assed vague apologize where you say sorry for things way less bad than the actual criticism. Own up to it and stop being a coward.
GET RID OF SHANE AND BRING BACK JENNA. 😊
Morgan actually makes a good point, there has got to be something sinister going on in that state. A majority of the tragedies we hear about happening all seem to come from Colorado.
🖤
I'm just a big old white man that wants to show the creepy spookies 👻👻👻 And Ryland just shaking his head 😂
Welcome back Shane!!! 💚🐽💚
rylands dad is like a bathroom wariior ok ok tiktotk is doing that please continue XD
Who’s the YouTuber at 31:01
Morgan looks so beautiful! 😍 So happy you're back Shane!!!
Thank you so much shane this is my comfort right now 😭 You're so effortlessly funny 😍
I've missed my birthday twin so much. Glad you are back queen.
That’s so heartbreaking. That they could surrender and that be ignored, they trusted in the humanity of the us soldiers.
Shane uploads…….. I stop working and sit down. Client walks in and witnesses me slacking 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️😂😂😂
Shane’s videos always brings comfort. I just get cozy and grab my snacks and forget about life for a bit
I wish I was in your guys friend group. You guys are so funny 😂
I just want to say I appreciate do much that you released some spooky shit during spooky season.
YAAASSSS!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Hi Shane !  Welcome back .I have an opinion why you think Things follow you every house you  move into. Its just a suggestion . I think ypu should remove all the toys n stuffed animals and statues from your house ... just put them together away in the basement for example . Try for a week .Maybe all the sounds and feelings go away.. i know u just moved and put all your nice things around the house but try it someday . Love you and God Bless you !!
THEY ARE DESTROYING THE BATHROOMS IN CANADA TOO!! Lol 😂
Shane uploads:  Me: Time too eat my soup
we didn't forget Shane
Your editing is so good I could cry ♥🌞
This is what i needed honestly, I missed him so much! love you always Shane and family x
is morgan moving back home temporarily while remodeling her house, or did something happen ?? 😱
29:09 LMAOO SHANE
Shane's eyes when he says things always follow him omg
Shane posting cured my depression
Morgan is so articulate, well-spoken and grounded. She should actually host a show!
Loving every minute of it! Welcome back!
Love this dude so glad ur back
PLEASE collab with Kendall Rae. That would be awesome.
I love that Shane is in Colorado, it’s so dope seeing someone I’ve been watching for years do scary videos on places in the city I’m from 👻💯
LFG
Morgan if you ever bat for the same team , would love to take you on a date beautiful
I fucking love Shane for this scary ass series and did any one else get the PREVIEW OF THE BLACK PHONE def going to go watch it!!!!
So happy you are uploading again! That background info on the bridge is pretty crazy. So sad.
The research, the effort, the editing, the comedy! This is the quality content I've been searching for for so long🙏 you've saved me once again Shane Dawson, I've missed you❤️
As a co native  I’m seriously loving this. Chessman park and sunken garden parks were both cemetery’s. Sunken Garden was a graveyard and they filled it in and made it a pool and then people kept dying in drowning in the pool and then they filled it in and made it park also downtown Ish Denver
Glad Shane is back
Yassssss!!!!
Very well done, love it!
I was so mad because I was in the middle of watching something when he dropped this. I love you Shane.
From a local Denverite (I’m not from CO but went to college here and I live/work here now): go into any tourist shop here and you’ll see a “ghost stories of denver and colorado” book they have for sale.
I missed you so so much!!!
Ahhh yay he posted again I was constantly waiting for this post and will. e for part 3 ! 👍💯 love u Shane keep up the great work! Ur doing so good.
Shane are you okay? You feel weird
shane should invest in a ghost box for these types of outings or have graveyardgirl go with him to would be cool. but im excited
Thank god you’re back. I needed those deep belly laughs And the banter between you and everyone is just unlike anything else
Did I miss it? When is the next one coming out
OMG the dog. I cant
COME ON MAN I NEED PART 3
Hello King welcome back to the platform
Grandma needs her own podcast
AHHHH
when’s the finale???!!
MORGAN IS GLOWING! 😍
I’ll watch this tomorrow I’m getting freaked out 😰
I live in denver right by cheesman.
Lol Bruce dragging the high school students
🖤
The only notification Ive got this week that I was actually waiting for and it did not disappoint. Thanks Shane!
Shane Dawson has saved me!! I love him so much and I have watched him since I was 9 I am 16 now. He reminds me I am worth something and that I shouldn’t stop doing what I want to do if people don’t like me,, Shane if you read this your my hero I love you with all my heart, I am so glad you safe and feeling better!!! You deserve the world❤️❤️❤️
I Spy Kendall Rae 👀
I love having videos to look forward to again. im so happy Shane is back and providing content to those who actually enjoy it. he is genuinely entertaining and doesn't deserve the hate.
Really wanna watch this but imma save it for tomorrow it’s 1235 am shit gonna get me scared 🤣
I clicked your video before Morgan’s.. that says something lmfaoo
omg Shane Dawson+MorganAdams+Kendall Rae COLLAB! Scary collab! Spooky collab. Someone call on Kendall! <3 LOVE KENDALL! Watch her videos always!! Shes the BEST true crime youtube there IS!!! and Shane is the BEST scary videos but also documentary youtuber there IS! Love how he edits his videos! CANT wait for the third video!!
What does Rylands mom do for work?
These videos are just 30-40 minutes of clips spliced together and absolutely nothing happening..
i’ve missed the spooky gang
I cannot fathom how much I missed watching Shane’s videos
Fun fact: A bison is not a buffalo.
so straight white girls get to say kiking now? great. just. great.
Another video that's getting me hyped- Really glad you're back and better, Shane. We missed you. :) Very excited to see the next part, man.      Also just to clarify, if you die my partner and I are gonna contact you- like- a lot-- Sorry if that gets annoying to your ghost self-----
So happy I can enjoy your content again 😊
Shane uploaded! Better go get my blanket and snuggle up. This is the best part of my day.
Ryland, why is your dad Hank Hill?
I'm so ready for this!!
It 12 am and i am watching this🙂🙃 Shane said things follow me🥶
THE EDITING OH MU GOD TBIS IS SO GOOD
Whenever I hear the word massacre, I think of tanacon.
I just bought a house with a 1 acre pond!  I keep calling it my lake...  Now that we both own lakes...how the hell do we take care of them?!
I missed this 💛
I NEED PART 3 RIGHT NOW
I laughed so many times throughout this video.
THIS WAS SO FUCKING GOOD???? HOLY SHIT
Miss Morgan is so pretty!!!!
More
Ugh That place is creepy and so disrespectful! How do people build a park over a cemetery?? Never disturb the dead. 🧿🧿🧿
IM SCREAMING
Awe snap, he’s at it again.
I feel like Shane would make such good horror movies, I hope he does in the futures. He us such a creative mind, the '6 hours earlier' and stuff. I'm rooting for him. I think he could sell out some cinemas. Ily shane, since day one and forever. SO glad you're back and please don't die.
Rylands and morgans parents kitchen looks like shanes old first kitchen
Dad's back 🥺
grandma has no idea what’s going on
Ryland’s dad being pissed at gen z is a *mood*
Chris talking over the sound really irritating lol
32:37 — LMFAO!   “I’ll be seeing ya”  “In the afterlife…”
I love the video, Shane!  However, some constructive criticism: I feel like the guy behind the camera has an annoying laugh and it bothers the hell out of me.   I keep cringing and waiting to hear his laugh in my ear again.  I think he could be a great camera man if he could just tape and try not to laugh directly in the the camera?  At times, I could barely hear you guys because the guy was laughing so much and so loudly.  Just my opinion of course, and other people might not feel this way, but I noticed it during both videos and wanted to let you know.  Keep giving us the new videos, we are SO glad you're back.
I love how Shane's videos are like a documentary movie like it's just so entertaining IT FEELS like a movie
This is actually terrifying. I hate scary stuff but i have to watch all of Shane’s videos so I’m trying to hold this one out….
Rest In Peace to all the Native Americans that had lost their lives shit is sad
I want more videos😣👄💅🏽🙄🦠🤦🏽‍♂️🙈🤭💕
I'm just so happy you're back!!!
anyone else think the camera's man laugh is annoying??? jw
He’s being hunted by a black man? The irony
Bring conspiracy videos back!!!
You can tell Ryland’s dad believes every Facebook conspiracy 😂
YESS ITS HEREE
This video style is giving me the paranormal activity movies style and I'm loving it
I MISS U SM
Clicked so fast when I saw he’d uploaded again!!
is colorado one of the places with skin walkers/wendigos?
Can someone time stamp me for when the video starts going into conspiracy/paranormal investigation?
omg i loooove Kendall Rae and her channel
Once I saw the “Aurora Colorado.” Part all I could think of was the video where the guys like “I’m in the ghetto ratatata.” 🤣🤣
I just wanna say... thank you for posting this during the day, so I don't have to hide in the comments .
3 kids got arrested at my school bc they completely vandalized the buses and git fined $15,000
The Native Americans flying the American flag and the truce flag made me start crying. It just shows how evil we humans are ):  I hate this is our legacy.
It looks like things are back to normal
Shane now that you're in Colorado maybe you can look at Skinwalkers? They have been seen in some parts there!
I hope i dont die!".. Gramma: yeahhh...lmfao!...
I am the same age as Morgan but I swear, she's wayyy more mature than me lol.
I really have to stop watching your videos at night... :D
Legit thanks Shane I missed you so much! Today my mom almost passed away its been hard and my job doesnt understand thanks for the content to rest my mind a bit... ♥ hope you love it here in Colorado so far.
I want a family like this
My dad would have livid about the little shite fucking up the bathrooms too.   Miss you Dad.  Please wear a mask. Its real, and it took my Dad. He was one of the strongest men ive ever met
Made my day
Literally have been watching Shane for 10 years, I’m so glad we’re getting some new content
K, this all random clips. It definitely doesn't need to be a series.
I feel sorry for the bodies left in the park. They never got their FINAL RESTING PLACE IN PEACE 😢💀👻
Me: Has two midterm exams tomorrow so I’m studying  Shane:part 2  Me:okay time for a study break!!   So excited to watch part 2😍😍
We need 2 hour long videos 🙏🏼🙏🏼
“why was somebody in the trunk? Colorado is WEIRD”   lmaoooo shaneeee I’m ded 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t wait for the finale, that bridge looks insane! Love Ryland’s family, they should have their own channel 😂 So good to see you use Omar’s clips too, he’s amazing! I’m so happy you’re back, please don’t stay away that long again! ❤️ xx
Morgan doesn’t have her house anymore?
I don't feel like Colorado is a place suited for Shane
Cant wait for the next vid
Morgan is so beautiful
I’m confused, why exactly is Third Bridge not safe?
Thank fucking godddd
SO GOOD SHANE!!! Your editing skills are unmatched!!! Can't wait for part 3! You're killing it!!!🔪🩸
I can't wait for part three!!! <3
Shane needs to meet Omar! I love them so so much
I love ryland and Morgan’s dad!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I wish they were longer 😢
MORGAN YOU LOOK SO GOOD BABYYY💜💜💜
I am happy that shane is uploading vedios ..just my day is completely completed
SHANE I LOVE YOUUUUU OFC U WOULD POST DURKNG SPOOKY SZN ILY ILT N I FORGIVE U WHY LIE /.\
definitely watching this when I get out of work🤭🤡
ngl i dont have an opinion on shane anymore, but the video was entertaining, BESIDES THE FACT a whole lotta nothing happened? like havent even left the house yet
So I wanna hear more about the cemetery park. That’s awesome
Yessss finally yr back !! Missed yr vlogs !
It’s my birthday today and Shane uploading a video makes it extra good 😄
That Kendall Rae mention aye🤙
welcome back shane👍👍
I missed you!!
love love love love love kendall rae ❤️❤️❤️
Morgan, youre not sucking out fluid from a boyle... Youre looking for SPIRITS. Lol. ×APPARITION×
I love Kendall Rae
Omg that was epic! I'm on pins and needles and need to see the rest, you are all awesome people and sending many more blessings your way, intriguing to no end! Kudos! :D
i just wanted to say i love you and growing up in colorado one case that i will always remember is the Kelsey Barreth case, it just never sat right with me and took place in woodland park, co and i just thought it might inspire you :) thank you for everything you do.
not morgan saying "aspiration" instead of  "apparition" and no one noticing 💀😂
Rylands dad is hilarious 😁
Jesus fuck, you actually got my heart racing during the Cheesman Park stuff lol I don't scare easily anymore, but that got me
Gold Camp Road in Colorado is also a crazy place, lots of activity, things I’ve experienced myself 😭 and crazy things that are constantly happening
ou my god he's actually posting
Is that Kevin Costner in the purple shirt sitting at Cheesman Park? 🤣🤣
I  love that the haters are still here giving him views.
Er ma gerd Love Morgan and Ryland but ur reference to Omar and a few other utubers was epic. ❤️U!
Love the series  ..   and family is the best definitely 💓
*them talking about haunted park and bridge in Denver* How come I didn’t know about this sooner  -_-
Such a good episode!! Can’t wait until the finale👏🏼
Having Shane post again brings me back to good days wen he use to post a simpler time I'm so happy
as a native, i don't think you should be editing the story of burial grounds as if it was a spooky fictional story, especially since that segment was before the confirmation that it was the result of a native american massacre. i appreciate the story being told because so many of our death are just forgotten, but i hope there wasn't more native voices you did not because a lot of this felt like white people telling a campfire story that was about white people committing hate crimes and contributing to genocide. please have more care. thank you.
The first 40 seconds you hear me screaming OK MORGAN!! I SEE YOU!! COME THROUGH THICKNESS!!
Yay!
Shane : “I hope I don’t die” Og Grandma: “Yeah😃”
Rylands dad is my dad.
👻👻👻👻👻
I'm so excited to see Shane again!! Make some more scary conspiracy videos!! Please!!
Not me hiding in the comments because I’m scared 🥺
Not me making a bowl of popcorn just for this
Yeah😍! Welcome back Shane
Morgan's so pretty bruh
I missed Shane’s posts
Are you this close to your mom Shane? I wonder...
This was so short 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ bring us a 2 hours episode 😂
😴😴😴
Wish my family was like theres🥴
Took to long to get into.  Good though. Shorten intros
Do you think we are worthy of a conspiracy theory video narrated in the old way? That'd be magnificent 😭💯
YES! He’s back!!!!!!
Ohhh me hearing chisme park🥴
Rylands dad is me in 30 years.
Iam so glad he came back to yt like u do not know how long ive been wait for this one moment ahhhhh i screamed when i saw this i already saw the first one ilysm shane😄😄😭
That was rylands childhood home? Yet he acts like he grew up poor? Um  no sir

We missed you Shane! Don't listen to the haters focus on all the people who love and appreciate you and the light you bring to this world💙
The night time shots of them driving reminds me of  No Through Road
Shane decided to post on my birthday   incredible
Love!!!
I’m soo excited
My day just got a whole lot better, glad you're back Shane ❤.
Shane does not care about anything but himself. It’s obvious he has not changed.
OmarGoshTV!! Such an amazing youtuber
Thank you for coming back when I’m going through such a rough time in my life
Welcome back

everyone hates you pleeeeease just leave again
I love you so much Shane I truly do and I missed you so much
Morgan is hot
Love that I got a scream ad before the video spooky vibes

"We saw an aspiration of a little girl" 😂
yes yes YES THIS IS WHAT I LIVE FOR my life has new meaning again 👌 love you Shane and  The whole family :D
Also it's about time.

I honestly can’t wait for the next part
It's 2:30 am here in Dubai so imagine me watching this alone 😅
Omg yay! Shane!!!  The moment I saw this pop up, I closed everything else. Yay!
Honestly Morgan looks absolutely beautiful 💚
ITS MY BIRTHDAY THIS MAKE MY DAY!!!♥♥♥♥
This is the type of video we have been needing!
33:07
go go go yes yes yes but plz make conspiracy theory videos me and my fiancee have been waitong for too much time plzzzzzzzz
Ahhhhh!! I missed this 😍
I hate this new cameraman, makes me nauseous. Can't keep the damn camera steady.
Welcome back Shane :) missed you on here watched you from the early days and sucks past things that at the time we’re funny come back to bite you later in life keep up the great work it’s always been amazing :)
Grandma: “huh” 😚✌️👁👄👁🌝
Rylands dad is a full fucking mood 😂❤️
Wtf. Go away
I'm sad! Working at the moment but watching this when I get off work!!
Love this comment section 💖
I'm glad you posted this when I'm on my dayoff❤️ Love you Shane❤️
WOOOO ghosties are back 🤩
Damn I waited a week n still haven't gotten to the ghost hunt
SHANE PLSSSSS GO TO HOT SPRINGS (ARKANSAS)!!! THERES A LOT TO DO THERE BUT ITS KNOWN FOR HAVING EXTREME HAUNTED HISTORY! ITS COOL BUT ALSO RLY FRIGHTENING AT THE SAME TIME. but anywho, love the vids
Since when does Morgan know history like that? Ok Ms. Adams
Yessssss Shane..... we missed you.
The beginning with the clock ticking reminds me so much of the intro to the Unus Annus videos 🥲😭 Memories are flooding back like crazy...  ..Uh.. I-I mean, what memories? What's Unus Annus? There's no such thing 🤐   ....You saw nothing.
Loving the comment section thus far... I know there’s some people that come here to literally only click the thumbs down button. What a sad existence.
YESSS THE 2ND EPISODE!!!!
He’s back
i’ve live in colorado my whole life (i’m 15), and i never knew that there were bodies under the park or the botanical gardens
Love u all
its like a scary movie where it starts off all happy and then spooky shit starts happening 😂
This wasn't near long enough. So glad Shane's content is back.  Nobody does this like Shane
Love you Shane and fam. But this gives me such anxiety.
Love u Shane, glad your bk
Love that Bruce is just going for everyone today lol
WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE
I love how much rylands family loves you! I wish my in-laws did ha! Another amazing episodes guys!!! I’m going to be so freakin sad after the 3rd episode airs. You have no clue how much I’ve been looking forward to this🖤
Waited all week for this lol literally marked my calendar
Omargoshtv yay 😊
35 minutes, Shane?? Really???? When you upload a video it better be AT LEAST 1 hr!
I can't wait another week for the 3rd part!
Another Shane video to make my day. ☀️ time to watch this on repeat until the finale is posted. Love you Shane 😁
shane and the gang are my fave so glad hes backkkkkk
HONESTLY THO IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE IDIOT STUDENTS THAT TRASHED YA SCHOOL...LMFAO YOU STILL ARENT COOL...and this is why nobody likes "our generation" sigh
Cant wait to watch after soccer practice !!!
It's disgusting what people did to the bodies buried at that park. That dude who chopped and moved pieces of bodies to make more money is like the evil version of construction crews starting 15 projects and leaving them unfinished for MONTHS and doing little things to milk the pay check from labor hours. Why do in one week and get paid standard, what you can do over several months for WAY more. I feel so bad for those people's families who have ancestors with unrested souls.
I mean Colorado is a perfect place for you to start making horror films and maybe documentaries on all these haunted places. That would be amazing
Glad you are back Shane. Looking forward to the next video. Blessed Be
I’m so excited😅💞
Just watch buzzfeed unsolved supernatural this is so unnecessarily long and boring
Cried hearing about the natives putting up the us flag and truce flag only to be slaughtered anyway
I swear to god,if I’m ever in an accident,and fall into a coma, just whisper in my ear that Shane Dawson has just uploaded. That’ll do it. I’ll wake up.😍
I LOVE MORGAN
Candy man? Nah, Cheesman
hey shane! if your interested in native americans there’s a movie called bury my heart at wounded knee. it’s not about what you talked about but it’s similar.
HE'S BACK?
STOP WHEN ID EP#3
there's too many positive comments he must be deleting the other ones
I NEED MOREEEEE
Loved this video! Cannot wait for part 3!
I kinda missed Shane
This went by way too quickly! Please keep making content no matter what it is ❤️❤️
Well I guess I don’t need to go to history class this week, professor Shane educating us all🍎
I lived in Denver for almost ten years and never knew this about Cheesman. My friends who lived their whole lives there don't even know! My husband and I went back to visit about a month ago, and now I have to go back for the park... Thanks for the info Shane!
34:13 literally my grandfather I love that
Shane could literally start a serie Reading the Telephone book and i would be Here for it.   Also, i Love how they interact with grandma. She ist so funny.
Please make sure you do the park one, that sounds interesting but to the one who created it, burying bodies like that smh but I would love to see what happens :)
I love Bruce
ok that was the most dragged out 30 mins of my life
Why does Morgan keep mentioning that the guy was white as if that's a bad thing? He's just an asshole. No race mention needed.
FUCK YES!!! Dark and disturbed....I LOVE IT!!!and he's giving us a 3 part series!!! MISSED YOU SO MUCH SHANE!!!!!! Oink Oink!!!🐷🐽
Omg wish it was longer
I’m used to Shane posting like hour long videos… this feels like it is dragging on
Kids are destroying bathrooms and recording it for tik tok?………….that’s it I give up 🤦‍♀️
We still gonna call these vlogs documentaries?
Did you guys notice that the dad has incognito at 10:10 lmao 😭
4:50 yeh. Here in the UK too. We’ve been banned from using props in Drama cause kids have been taking them and all the teachers stuff has been ripped up all over the floor
So I know this was posted less than 2 hours ago but uh..is the 3rd part out yet?😳
Once your fanbase is dedicated, You could murder someone and still get views. This is just sad.
I'm so happy to see shane again. Its time everyone moves forward from his past and let it go.
awh I love Omar🔥
I have my notification on, but I still didnt get notified of this video 🤔
I have been patiently waiting for this upload!!!!
Nothing new
Welcome back Shane. I'm proud you have grown past your past and are able to come back.
I literally stopped working when I saw the notification 😂😂😂
Yayyyyy to Shane being back bringing us the scary tea ☕️ 👻🎃
When you get two scary movie ads and watch both for Shane and the first one was scream
dad is so chaotic i love it
ohhhh the cliffhanger  ughhhhh youre really good at teasing us. Cant wait for the finale.
OMG! I'm so glad to have Shane back! I missed his content so much! I'm loving this! The cameraman's laugh is hilarious and I find myself laughing along with him!✌❤🇨🇦
YESS YOUR BACK 🤍
thank you shane
I HOPE TO GOD SHE SEES THESES COMMENTS BECAUSE SHE LOOKS AMAZING
Sooooooo glad you are back!!!!!!!
Morgan NEEDS to be a model
I was worried
No matter what they’re talking about, Shane always does the best job with the spooky music to get us all into the mood for hauntings.
LIKE I CANNOT BREATHE SHE SO SO BEAUTIFUL
Not totally video related but Colorado related has Shane been to Casa Bonita tho? For some reason I think he would enjoy it.
That Tik Tok trend is the silliest thing I've ever heard it probably lasted for like 2h
Ive missed you shane, so happy to see ur face 💗
*externally screaming*
Love u Shane! 🥰 praying for you, Ryland and Morgan. I cant watch bc im a christian but im so glad youre back. Xxx penny
Omg can't wait for the next part!!
Ryland bringing girls in that places and girls getting scared so “they’re more likely to make out with us”.. :/ that sounds like coercing girls which is sexual assault. This group make interesting content but now i can see how fucked up they are :/ also Morgan once said on a video, a guy basically forced her to have sex with him in the river because he wouldn’t give her pants back so she did and the guy still ended up throwing the pants in the river. That’s r3pe :/
And the editing is incredible
Are rylands parents republican? Because they are giving off that vibe.
They really don't want us to go there!! Well that was shit they didn't show anything 👎
Shane if you see this, there is a very haunted prison here in Ohio where I used to live, even MrBeast did a video on it. It is consider one of the most haunted prisons in the world, with a lot of evil entities and spirit. If you are interest let me know! I can send you everything about the place and town! Also its amazing that you are doing better mentally and its good to have such an unique style of humor, that this platform is lacking :)
MORGAN LOOKS SOOOO BEAUTIFUL
Bruce is a mood! And I'm here for it! He is the best dad ever! I love his level of concern for the schools and how funny he is. And he is always there for his kids and their partners. #TeamBruce
these comments have to be filtered ayo??
I know we all hate what you did BUT HELL YEAH CONSPIRACY THEORIESSSSSS
I have miss you Shane it feels like we have before  cancel Shane when he did ghost videos and go  to haunted places and just being his old self
Literally Tana pays so much for plastics just to look half as beautiful as Miss Morgan <3 stunning.
I'm in awwwwwwww
Yessss!!! I’ve missed you Shane!!  You are beautiful!! Keep shining your light!!
Okay Morgan looks literally amazing ugh love her sm
Yuck
Hi, so happy you’re back! Call Jenna, please xo miss her too :)
Yall i was eating ramen at the part where they said a guy was cutting peoples body parts that was gross asf😭😭
I’ve missed Shane so much! We have all done things in our past that we may not be proud of. And we would all want the opportunity to grow and learn from it, and still be loved. I think it’s only fair he gets that too. Welcome back Shane, you still have people who adore you.
You don't even know how I needed that kind of entertainment right now. Thank you Shane <3
Okay but can we talk about how beautiful Mrs. Adam's hair is?! I may be gay but I know a MILF when I see one!
"Morgan: Ryland's sister" as if she is not the main character always!
Love these videos but sometimes it just feels like a little to much editing and scary music like  I love the video topics but the show you put on with the editing just kinda take away from it
"It's dead🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️ like the massacre victims 😐" bruh had me laughing hard asf
There's way to many clips of other people's videos. It's like half the video. I'm not here to watch them 😂
Colorado looks  so beautiful
Anybody else on break at work watching? 💀😭
Honestly missed you Shane
The drum beats sound like when a train goes past... So I'd believe it could be the oil rig, or whatever you said it was.
I liked the video clips that shane used but I hate omargoshtv. Every single one of his videos are hilariously fake
Shane: I’ve missed you  Me:I THOUGHT YOU DIED
The dog steals the show
Keep filming 😃
Honestly we missed you too
what in the 2019 bs is this comment section 😀
Hi I love seeing you back to YouTube <3
Yesssss more shane dawson!! P.s Rylands dad needs to be in videos more..better yet his own channel.. He's hilarious!
Every time you upload I get SOSO happy <3
WHENS PART 3
I am so happy!!! I love your videos!
Omg almost every bathroom in my school is closed because girls are taking sinks off the walls, boys are stealing soap dispensers, and they’re even kicking stall doors in so you can’t lock it and have privacy! It’s crazy.
Love them all but that grandma is 🤌🏼
YESS FINALLY BACK THEY CANT STOP US WE <3 U
Soooooo glad y’all are back!!
Lol and Ethan wanted to say Shane was trying too hard Bc “you’re not gonna find a haunted ranch in Colorado”
Yasssssssss shane 👏🐷
im so exited!!!!!!
I need more !!!!!
Morgan is looking extremely beautiful and GLOWING.
THANK YOU SHANE FOR COMING BACK. LIFE IS COMPLETE NOW!!!!!
QUIT EDITING POP UPS ITS NOT OKAY 😭
The last time I was this early for a Shane video it was 2008
Yay Kendall Rae reference!! Just as I was thinking Morgan was doing such a good job with her research and storytelling 💖
YESSSS KEEP DOIN WHAT UR DOING 😩❤️
Grandma is so lost lol
It makes me happy that you decided that 3 part paranormal video was going to be your comeback. You went back to your creepy roots with a new version of you! I LOVE IT AND LOVE THAT FOR YOU!!!! <3
Omggg
Forgot to say this on ur first vid but I've been watching u since the emo hair and im glad to see u happy and back to doing YouTube
Shane , your amazing when doing haunted videos . Very entertaining !
The music and WHOMP noise was a tad loud during the Cheeseman Park bit Shane!
❤️❤️❤️
This is what I needed I never flipped on Shane stayed loyal to him purrrr
YES SHANE YOU JUST GOT ME ALL HAPPY
Sitting on my couch really comfy with my shane dawson hoodie and my fav soda(pop) coca cola and some chips 😬😝👏🏼 happy Shane's back love hearin his laugh 😌
Shane I'm so happy to see you back doing what you love. I've watched you right from the beginning and I'm 43. I have an omg omg omg pig shirt and never stopped believing one day you would finally b ready to come back. OMG I AM SHOOK!
❤️❤️❤️
Shane finally gets comfortable going out in public... Morgan "Yeah you have a higher chance of dying here"... oooookay then... lol
The fact that people still vibe really makes me question in reality.  And this is coming from a fan who has been a fan of him until the cancelation
Love you but this series is weird
tbh Morgan is such a queen
This turned my shitty day SO MUCH BETTER! So glad to have you back!
Ugh I’m so bummed it’s almost towards the endddd, need MORE!
So when is part 3 coming out?
20:19 kendall
That trend happened at my school all of the boys bathrooms were  closed because somebody stole a soap dispenser, a sink, and (attempted) to steal an entire stall door
in my home town Kingston Ontario, theres a popular park downtown called Skeleton Park. People find bones all the time. It was built on top of a grave yard also
Ryland’s dad needs his own podcast with nothing but his hot takes.
So you're telling me I have to wait until Thursday for a new one? 🤨 WTF.... I can't wait that long. Hell I barley survive waiting for wu-tang on wednesday. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Can I marry Morgan please
That brown dog with rylands dad looked so nervous lol also love that many parts of the first 10 minutes was literally talking about TikTok kids stealing from schools lmao
YOUR FINELY BACK
theories shane = best shane
Love you Shane I’m so happy your posting now
What is the small TikTok break 😂😂
HYPED
You need to do a series of haunted places in TX. There’s several spots
Missed you!!!!
JUST GOT HOME FROM A 12HR SHIFT.... ROLLING A BLUNT 🤤🤤 AND WATCHING THIS IS THE PERFECT REWARD That tik tok trend is dumb asf !! In my day we used to wet paper towels and throw them at the ceiling so they would stick.... NEVEEEEEER DESTROYED THE PROPERTY...
😍
these series are so dragged out n boring wow
Can someone please let me know if there’s any flashing lights in this video? And if there is can I have the time stamps so I can skip? :(
Ugh can you not wait another 5 days to post the ACTUAL video ughhhhh
Who's excited for PART 3!!!!!!!! :D
Shane upload on my birthday? best birthday ever.
I actually think third bridge isn't necessarily haunted, but there is an imprint there. An imprint is basically when something very traumatic happens in a certain location and the energy of that traumatic event leaves an imprint at that location. When you go to a location where there is an imprint you may feel the heaviness or the pain, see the souls, hear the sounds, etc.
Make these longerrrrrr like an hour! Haha I need moreeeeee x
Where is this at i live in colorado
Need this to fast forward to the ghosts hunting part... too excited!
youre definitely way more likely to get murdered in california than colorado lol
Gotta love shane Dawson…he’s one of the best content creators of all time
Just me at 1 am in Lebanon with no electricity watching this and scaring myself lol
Someone should’ve taken one for the team and carried grandma on their back so she could join in on the spooky fun 😂😆
I’m so happy Shane is back. He provides everything i look for in YouTube. Horror, comedy. And creativity. Plus just like me. His fave film is scream. Which has been my fave since the first time I saw it. When I was like 8. I’m 30 now
I am so happy Shane is back. His videos are everything 😍
Yaaaaaaaasssss I’ve been checking for this all day
Can we take a second to appreciate how GOOD Morgan’s butt looks😂🙌respectfully
Who cares about the devious lick challenge “prosecute them” what a silly thing to say yes let’s prosecute kids for being stupid
Happy you're back! Very excited for you to get back into what you love!
Morgan is so beautiful ♥️
Should come to NC and visit Dorothea Dix Hospital (1st psychiatric hospital in NC) which has now become a park and I am obsessed. I know ppl that worked there and there are tunnels underground that go from building to building and some of them had chains affixed to the walls and such. It is such a creepy vibe. I legit hang out in the cemetery there lol 🤷🏻‍♀️
I love these people
Yasssss
God I cant wait for the fiance! LOVE YOU SHANE! and Ryland too 💕
Oh hell nah
I don't believe in ghosts but I'm actually excited for part 3, it's gonna be entertaining.
This is to much build up Shane... With love and respect you didnt spend 3 out of the 5 Queen Mary episodes sitting in your house talking about the ship!   This should have been a 2 part series, prt 1 was nothing but catching up, part 2 was un-needed fluff talking about the place your going to in part 3 for 30 min with spooky editing!   Shane I love ya, Im happy your back, BUT THIS WAS NOT IT... You have tease this for 2 episodes, 1 and a half hours of video, and over a week of waiting and part 3 might just be a goofy let down. This was to much build up, please go back to the old style, this really felt like you said to yourself "I can milk a 30 minute video out of talking to Morgan about this place, before we go to the place!" Is this really the big comeback!?
I’ve been waiting a week for the scary stuff to happen and you’re making me wait more!?😩
this is edited so well
No university homework is worth of my time when Shane uploads
just wanted to say that Morgan is not only extremely pretty but also so charismatic and funny. i love her so much <3
Thank you for bringing light to the Sand Creek Massacre. They will never teach these things in schools but it’s the truth we need to hear.
The kendyl rae shout out♥️♥️ LOVE YOU QUEEN AND LOVE YOU SHANE
Love Shane... 💕❣️💕
This video was actually so amazing 😭
OMG LET ME GO GET MY SNACKS !
When my husband died(he passed young) I kind of stopped believing in ghosts. The major thing that makes me think maybe, is a video I captured, that many years ago, me and him went to a cemetery and it was during the day. We stopped to read a historical plaque of this tiny run down cemetery. I was fine, until we were about to walk towards this one area and I got this overwhelming feeling that something was there, just total dread and fear. I turned on my crappy digital camera and took a quick video. We left, went to taco bell, I came home and watched the video clip and freaked out. There's this red human shaped figure walking right where I was afraid of walking to. We were alone, I would love a logical answer to what this thing was, I've watched the video countless times😂 it's actually up on my channel(I'm not a YouTuber lol I just posted it to my channel for my mother in law, because you can hear my late husband talking in the clip)
The prob Ihave w/ Shane is he always says he has ghosts in his home/with him, then he hears things on ships, etc. But he has a video using & disrespecting ouija boards. If you believe in this shit then why do that?
I love you all so much! Especially Morgan 😏❤️❤️❤️
Morgan is gorgeous woman 🤍
bestie you should be real ashamed for coming back, you haven’t taken enough time away and your whiteness is the only thing keeping you supported and  protecting you from truly being cancelled
ok next video out when
Love that Shane is back!!
I was playing pubg. I saw my notification of shane uploading. Literally stop playing and exit pubg after that😂
Rylands dad talking about devious licks and shane making it dramatic is hilarious
From Brittney Spears documentary to public school toilets? You're circling the drane, Shane.
I missed you hunnie welcome back ‼️‼️‼️
Can ANYONE. Post what the words on the black screens say?
here for the comments
I honestly forgot it was thursday
I'm so happy the spooky content is back!
Got the notification on my way home. A bitch might have sped home...❤
the fact that dad is updating them on the latest tiktok trends LOL
i don’t like the new camera man
😍😍
I love that Shane is uploading again! Just a quick question though… do you think you could not use so many clips from other youtubers or news videos? It takes up so much of the episode and I get the effect your trying to give BUT I want to watch you and your family, not another youtuber
Didn’t you grape someone?
Please do a video with @Kendall Rae
This makes me so happy. ❤️
Mr. Adams is too pure for this world.
That background music playing during the description of the park is annoying af..Jesus
Me too grandma 😂😂😂
Shane with this series, is actually bringing me back into the spooky spirit. Feels like i'm a teenager again
The school vandalizing is happening like even in my school
Looking forward to the next part.  Keeping it all real.  Thank You  :)  xx
video: 35 minutes long me: wow it’s over already???? Damn
Me wanting to watch a short scary video: sees its 34 minutes Me:*face palms* well looks like imma be here a while it's totally worth it
It’s never long enough! The camera mans laugh sounds like his old camera man! Lol
I got 2 baby pigs on my page. 🥰🥰
Ok seeing Omar on here was AWESOME! 😄 I’m a huge Omargosh fan, awesome Youtuber along with hearing Aiden too.. I definitely needa rewatch Omar visit the Third Bridge. I can’t wait to see the finale 😁
Pretty weak part, all padding - so you guys are only gonna DO something in the third part ? The park Ryland's dad talked about sounds WAY more interesting than that bridge...Why not go there ? The bridge stuff basically got debunked in this video already.  And the editing is A LOT lol... I hope Part 3 is longer and action packed cuz...
ily
Never unsubscribed , I knew you’d come back ❤️
i love this
Please don't make us wait another whole week!! I need more asap 🙏🙏🙏
so glad he's back 😭❤️
It’s crazy Shane because we just moved to aurora CO and we love the horror series so far maybe we could come along to one of the haunts I’m all about the scary shit and definitely should do an episode about the conspiracy of the airport I’ve heard about that one before someone did a documentary on it awhile ago but I’m sure yours will be better much love my guy
Claim "here before a million views" award here✨✨✨
America’s education system doesn’t do any justice of emphasizing what we truly put Native Americans through. We literally have a holiday for a person who didn’t even discover America but not for the thousands of lives lost that were here originally????
New challenge on tiktok but the new one is slapping the teachers or something🤦‍♀️ I love that you are back though! And I love these haunted videos. Rylands grandmas should come on the adventures
I hate school for making me miss this masterpiece 🥲
This man really just started posting out of nowhere lol.  Hey if Fed can come back on Twitch after sexually assaulting his friends. I guess Shane can come back from the shit he has done.
“did they run out of dance moves?” 💀💀🤚
💜 Glad to have you back Shane and the rest of the family too, but most of all Grandma. 💜
I love Rylands dad he's so honest hahah
I’m so happy Shane is back for spooky season
I’m SOOOOO glad you’re back and just in time for Halloween. 👻
I hate how most of the video is kinda crap vlogging tbh
I love grandma. Without her I would not be able to watch this without being spooked.
Such a tease omg  I can’t wait
Love you bitch
I've missed this sweet family so much❤ Can't wait for the next episode!! And Morgan, you're still just as beautiful as ever!!! Lots of love to you all🥰
Shane after Morgans done telling him that horrible history- " *i was excited to go back into the world* " with the saddest face! But so excited to see how this will go down next episode.......
Loved the video! Can't wait till part 3!
Im convinced the haters  have notifications on just to dislike the video.. that's sad
We love 2 horror movie trailers on Shane's video
Omg omg omg yayyyyyyyyyyy
umm where’s all the hate comments
IM INVESTED IN THIS OMGGG
I clicked on the video, and I excitedly looked to see how long it would be, hoping it was like at least an hour.  I literally said, “Only 34 mi- Shane!”  I will take what I can get though! Loving this series already! ❤️
I was not someone that liked these videos . Umm fckit I still get scared   But Mrballen trained me to love these videos
Love love love!!
Hm its dead 😂😂
I'm super emotional over how fucking much I needed my nigga shane back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Come to NYC my guy
yay I'm so happy! Shane being back makes my heart feel so warm!
I love this and you…. That’s all
i miss rylands moms short hair 😭😭
Hahahaha. Now I’ll just wait for Morgan’s dad to say: “Let’s go Brandon”.  If you know, you know 😂😂😂😂
That's what I'm sighing for
MORRRRRRRGGGGGAAAAANNNNNN 😍
The music transition at like 3:00 ish is KILLING me. So funny from "mom you shouldn't have taken it! You'd be dead" in dark car with scary music, to bright sunshine, twinkling bell music. Love the juxtaposition! Nice editing!
What they did to my culture of Indigenous people infuriates me so fucjimg much ugh 😡
Stop nkt the devious licks
us: *just enjoying watching the video*  shane: “i’m just a big ol white man that wants to show the creepy spookys”
Missed you all!
Yayayayayata
“Cheesme” park 💀💀
The music in the background is WAY TOO LOUD 😫 my poor eardrums..... still watched the ENTIRE  video though because I've been loving and waiting Shane's comeback video series!!!!
Getting Blair witch vibes pls stap
Yess I’m so glad you’re making videos again it brings joy to my week ❤️😭
I'm sorry I just can't watch a Shane video how I used to anymore.
When your first video dropped l was talking to my daughter that you ha e a video and we both agreed that we jave just missed shane everything l missed your laugh and mina said l just missed shane we need this two things we love scary paranormal stuff with a Shane twist love thiss always xx
Oh thank God something good!

Our local high school the boys broke the urinal off and took it home in pieces in their bookbags 🙄 the teacher now goes in and looks over and under the stalls as they are in there😂a little violating but stop being idiots.  Honestly just stop watching the vandalizing tiktoks.
I want the third part soooo bad
So happy you are back!
I love Rylands grandma😂😂😂
The man in the red t shirt is flipping epic need more of him Shane please xx
This was so cool!!!
i slept the day away just so i could watch Shane when  i woke up lmao
Can we talk about how beautiful Morgan is?! Wow
Anyone find it funny how Ryland used to never believed in ghost
I got goosebumps just by your opening scene 🖤🖤🖤👻👻👻
I need some videos of the cheesman park. That is insane
OK next on my to-do list is…. Shane posted? DROP EVERYTHING let’s go!!! 🏃🏽‍♀️
so happy you're back Shane <3
Ryland's dad has no filter, I love it.
Omar!  Who else is a fan of him? Also love your videos Shane
Shane-  “I hope I don’t die” Grandma- “Yeah 😃”  😂😂😂
Really Great how you are including other deserving you-tubers.  Cool series! I saw Poltergiest at 12 and went back to see it several times... the Original movie at theatre ...no VCR’s then lol. Ghosts are real... my son and I saw my deceased husband walk through the house. Looking forward to your next video. Much love!
woooooo! grabbing my beer and snacks, I already wish the video was longer and I haven't hit play yet!!
❤️
I didn’t realize how early I am lmao I’m halfway through and it was posted 30 mins ago
Okay so Rylands dad needs a channel.
morgan is so pretty u.u i wish she'd model!!
all ghosts aside let’s talk about how freaking pretty morgan is
YESH!!
Grandma casually laughing saying "yeah" lol she's so funny
Lmao Ryland's response to Shane asking if thing's follow him "like what ghosts, demons, me"
King is back
Shane, your videos make me happy. I get excited seeing the notifications for them, and the editing has always been on point. So glad you're back 🖤
We've missed you more! So excited for this series and whatever else you wanna send our way!
I love that phat bussy you got there, keep doing yo thang shawty
does anyone else love rylands moms hair
Oh Bruce
One of the workers from the Denver botanical gardens said not too long ago they found more coffins / bodys when they recently made the children's garden section of the garden
Best part of video.. Morgan "did you guys know the annoying orange is back?" No I didn't but yay!!
M: "Is grandma gonna come?" Ryland: "she wouldn't hear em coming" "she'd feel the essence" When I say I laughed out loud foreal 🤣💀💀💀
So glad you're back Shane. Morgan has such a beautiful face, hair. I'm in love w Ryland's parents Boston Terrier, just ADORABLE. Please don't joke about getting killed!! Stop it OMG...
Once again, Bruce is the best
cannot wait for the finale!!
My step brothers passed away on the road to 3rd bridge 😢
This is PERFECT for my after school snack and wind down!!! Missed you
I fucking missed you.
I fw with the content but damn another 30 minute trailer 🙄
We all been waiting for shane return
It's so nice to see Shane back again! This series seems to be really interesting and I hope there's gonna be more of this kind, even when it's not Halloween season 👻.
I can’t hear the drums when people record shit they need to be quiet lol
“Did they run out of dance moves?” LMAO god I hope so, those cringy fuckers need to stop
Please go to that park it’s so interesting and sounds like a great video I kinda wanna go there too
SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY HES BACK😭
Okay but imagine an entire series based on historical events / tragedies that educates and talks about hauntings in a respectful way. It would be important cause I feel like a lot of people werent taught a lot about our societal history. And now people dont like certain aspects of it so they want it removed. But history isnt there to agree with or disagree with it's to learn from. If you destroy / remove it  you get rid of its potential lessons.
Ew
Im loving every second of this new series.
Yasss!!!!  Love u Shane so glad to see you creating again
Yessssss 🙌🙌 shaneeeeeeeeee ❤️
Chessman ain't haunted.
…Morgan is back at her parents house? Huh, what happened to the big new barn house move?!
Nothing better to kick of going to see Halloween Kills tonight than pregaming that with THIS.
Ah yes… the devious licks lol
No I can't wait for the next one 😭😭🎃👻
We missed you as well Queen!!! u_U I even became a pewdipie simp and stop doing my makeup ever since u left....
Yaaaaay you’re back 🥺🥰❤️
I’m so happy you’re back Shane , your pass does not define your present. We love you!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
My favvvvvv
Next episode needs to hurry up. I love Morgan's hair like this, looking beaut, just FYI.
ok but morgan is GLOWING
Morgan is so pretty ♡
My favourite spooky squad!!❤❤❤
I'm with rylands dad I couldn't wash my hands for weeks after beating my meat 😐 at school like I will not stand for this.
Geuss I can stay awake longer watch some Shane content ❤💯
Your family is just the absolute best!
I missed him 🥺🫂
Damn, I’ve missed this. Thank you and welcome back Shane💛
Wow, Morgan looks really beautiful. Can't put my finger on what's changed. Maybe she looks more mature.
My god, i haven't clicked this fast in a looong time. Welcome back Shane ❤
YES SHANE I MISSED YOU
I love uuu
Morgan is BFF for life energy
I’m using earbuds and the music seems so much louder than anything anyone is saying. Had to turn it down soooo much. Anyone else having that problem?
Shane, I just have to say, I’m SO glad you’re back! I’ve been following you for a long time.  You have such an incredible light that the world needs more of. You have a beautiful soul and you and Ryland are such an adorable couple. Wishing you lots of success and happiness on this next chapter in your life. Sending love and big hugs to you both! ~ Amy
Shane: things follow me Also Shane: let's go to the most haunted bridge where there are tons of spirits.   🤣🤣
It literally didn't feel like 35 minutes at all, I could watch for hours
shane extremely good job on this video
I thought he got canceled 🤔
Nothing happened...It was a video where they filmed conversations. Such a dope series to make a return for. Oh my bad, I meant, "Yay, I'm so happy Shane is back!" "Shane: posts a series that I've waited so long for. Me: Like, literally putting on my jammies because with Shane my life is now complete again"
I think my favorite part has got to be how trendy Rylands dad is
And he's finally back. I needed some interesting content.
OHHHHHH WHY DO I HATE RYLAND AND MORGAN SO MUCH   !!! IM A BAD PERSON YES INO BUT ALSO WE SUBBED TO SHANE NOT SHANE AND LEECH BOYFRIEND AND HIS WEIRD SISTER
🙋‍♂️ Your back 🥰!!!!
Me listening to the story of Cheesman Park like  👁👄👁wtf
Ryland’s grandma seems so sweet ❤️ his whole family does honestly
I couldn’t ghost hunt, I wouldn’t take it seriously I would be laughing to much and screaming in Spanish lol 😂
Your doing good sweetie
I’m just waiting for the actual paranormal part though
OMG I MISSED YOU SM
i love the haunted comeback. it’s pretty interesting..
I NEEDED THIS TODAY!!!
Loveee that you're back!! I really lol missed your editing style 😍
Me- watching Kendal Rae *Shane posts*  Me- sorry Kendall 😬  THEN KENDALL GETS MENTIONED?!  👁️👄👁️ Wut.
CAN'T wait for the next one
Rylands dad is the best 😂
Watching this at midnight might not have been my best idea
I am loving this new content! Thank you for the spooky videos. 👻👻
Listening to Morgan tell the tale:🍿😲
I just wanted to say, I've watched the first 30 second and as a horror fan I'm officially spooked *thank yew*
I love rylands parents his dad cracked me up in this video
yessir
I ❤️ Ryland’s Gramma so much
i love bruce’s concern for the devious licks bombarding the nation
Morgan is beautiful
OH MY GOD JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO GET INTO BED !!!! YASSSSS
hmm, i seem to be interested…
Shane I can't tell u how happy I am your have you back!! Ilysm and always grandma is the best
Legit LOVING coming home from work, and having a NEW SHANE video to watch 🤩🤗😍💖👊🏼 Thank You Fam 😉☺🙌🏼
👑🥺
🙌🙏🙌
I have never clicked so fast on a video
Actually, it is quite believable that sounds and smells stick to a place. If you think about energy and how it "behaves", you will find some explanation and some answers on why what we consider to be "ghosts" is actually pretty realistic. It does not make it unscary. We just have to shift our idea of a ghost and that it might not be a creepy girl with long black hair or a white blanket hovering over a table. If we see things from a energy perspective - U can't deny that it is real, that it effects us - And that energy stays and never really goes away, it just shifts.
Me: Asks Siri every hour what time it is in Colorado so that I don’t miss this.  My boss: 🤨
😍👍
omfg y’all switch up so fast😭😭😭
So far Shane 🙀 Hugs to grandma  she’s the best  Rylands dad is real says  how it is .
Love the twist on conspiracy theories now being haunted theories!!!!
this gives me vibes when they went to that haunted ship like 3 years ago. favorite shane era
Excited for next video already!
13:35 did anyone else look at their phone for a text message...? lol
oop- chile
granny appreciation post
The humor lol 18:37 Shane perfect editing. made me laugh! lol
Honest review: this episode went on too long with the history. I was expecting to see them of out and look around. But guess have to wait till next video. I even skipped ahead because I got bored. Just MY own opinion.
Absolutely loving it cannot wait for the next episode ♥️
idk if it’s just me but I feel like chris forces most of his laughs
In all seriousness I know this video is about haunting a of Colorado. However, I can not express enough how much I have missed rylands family being in the videos more. My favorite types of videos from ryland Shane and Morgan are when they are centered around their family in Colorado. They are all so funny and kind and warm my heart. Grammy is the start of it all
Is grandma gonna come? Well she couldn’t hear it coming 😂
Not me watching this in the middle of the night 👀 oof
Shane posts and all is right with today.
Anyone else been waiting all week and it's the only thing you were looking forward to?  No just me ok 😔
I literally can NOT express how happy I am that Shane is back
My daughter says there’s a man in her closet a lot at night. She’s 6 ends of sleeping in our room a lot
lol i live like two blocks from cheesman park 👻 it’s cool to see shane highlight stories from colorado!
Havent seen this man in years
Love you and love this Shane!!! Thank you ❤️
man I have missed him.
you do not understand how happy i am shane is back
Grandma is a cutie pie and Rylands dad is hilarious 😂
Literally stoped everything got on my bed to watch this lol
I screamed when I saw you were in Aurora 🥲 that’s where I live. I wish I would’ve met you ugh
saw this stop everything what i was doing Get snacks sit and watch
Ryland's dad looks like a straight Chad Michaels..
Tell Chris to not laugh as loud lol
So I'm at 13:39 and had to pause watching because I got so freaked out 😭
Um, why is everyone forgiving him? Some of you only called him to fit in with everyone else, and it shows. I’m beyond tired of this performative shit
I haaaaaate the camera work…it’s soo shaky!! ☹️
Yey Shane ❤️❤️ but the camera man laughing is super distracting... 🙄 Inhale laughing
One Piece got less filler than this episode
I told myself to watch 5 minutes only to save it for later and i ended up watching the whole thing i just can't stop LMAO
GRANDMA! ❤ 5:43 and already my favourite person is on screen
Im sorry Shane I hate the sounds of the vibrations. 😂
*Shane has posted a video* I am so happy to see this notification again!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I damn near sprained my thumb with how hard I clicked this notification
I'm so HAPPY your back! Don't let anyone keep you from showingbyiur talent. They're more supportive fans then not. 💞
WARNING: Before you watch this video, make sure to get some snacks and a beverage to get the utmost enjoyment out of watching this video, you're welcome!🙌
I really hope you start posting regularly again. Missed your videos!!!
Anyone else get vampire diaries feels since the battle took place in 1864? No? Just me? Sounds about right

Hi Shane!! 🤪🥰

This makes me happy and scared
Bruce is a wise man. facts
🔥🔥🔥
great video
Don't mind me, just hiding in the comments....it's 3:30am and I'm scared 🤣
Why are all the comments supportive?
I can't WAIT for part 3!!! So excited!!! I love Ryland's family, and Chris seems so sweet!
ah, so... now this guy can just come back? Although it's obvious he hasn't changed at all. You're  all pathetic!
Thank you and much love to you, Shane!  So happy you’re back and I cannot wait for the finale!!!  Great episode this week and Morgan rocked it!
Shane you look gorgeous
so shane is back, AND the comments aren’t crazy toxic yet?? i must be dreaming
Let's GOOO. I'm excited. But also. Nah cause I hate spooky stuff. Like I'm just a snow flake and thing sorta just stick to my brain. Let me make it clear I'm gonna watch all Shane spooky video..but I'm gonna need it to be a very lite room with the sun still out.
wake up babe, shane dawson just posted!
Ryland’s family is so wholesome
Welcome back shane
I fucking love him ❤
I'm so happy your back Shane! I clicked as soon as I noticed you uploaded.
SHANE OMG MISSED YOU AND THESE VIDEOS 😭
Shane needs some more money 😁
WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UPPPP
Mom is always making me feel so homie
I love it how everyone thinks this is real. Ghosts don't exist!
is this a sick joke
We went once and as soon as we opened the car doors we heard a really loud scream. We went another time and we have photos of hand prints on the back of our car. We've heard drums and screams. It was so crazy.
Literally the most important person on YouTube is BACK
Woo hoo! Let’s go!!! 😀🎃👻
You’re filling a hole in my heart. Thank u
Morgan looks GORGEOUS. RICH! Fuck! Living for it!
Idk if I believe in this sorta stuff but I’ll say, my smalltown has their own version. The story is basically that a 13 year old girl here got in trouble by her parents for talking to older guys online. Just high schoolers that she actually knew in real life but still. Dirty stuff. But when they confronted her on it, they argued and (she posted this allegation) her dad was so mad that he called her a whore. She broke down and admitted that the only guy she’s ever hooked up with was actually her mom’s brother that lived down at the end of their street. They called her a liar, again just allegations she’d shared on her socials. Well, two weeks later, *everybody* is talking about her posts, including the school administrations from her middle school and our high school. Still, no one even bothers to investigate or question the uncle, just her messages with guys. Not even a week after the schools hold assemblies to warn everybody of the dangers and laws around sexting and underage/consent laws, this girl goes missing. For legit like 3 days. Her street is adjacent to a public park that acts as a preschool park sometimes (it’s across the street from the school and has more space and equipment than theirs) and her backyard is separated from the park by a fence that her family put up/owns. Right behind their fence is probably 20-30 yards of trees and then the park opens up. She hanged herself in one of those trees. I think the paper said it was like 13 yards from her backyard. They searched this entire town for 72 hours and she was right there the entire time. They found tied into her necklace that said she was “there” because of her uncle. Any way, now, everybody in that area reports hearing a girl screaming and/or crying late at night. Her uncle moved away after all the backlash (from us, not the cops or her parents...) and the family that bought his house claim it’s haunted and they think by a young teenage girl (even though when they first mentioned it, they hadn’t heard the story of this girl and the uncle, etc.) That was three years ago now. The last two years, we’ve had tornadoes come through that NEVER happened before. I mean, so bad that Trump (🤮) visited for one of them...her parents’ fence in the backyard was destroyed by falling trees from the park during *BOTH* storms... 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’m just so happy that Shane is creating and doing what he loves again. I’m so disappointed in people bashing him. This is his art.
I love Grandma!! 😂❤ I thought some ish was about to go down..I can't wait!!!
LOVED IT!!
I missed you so much ngl I danced when I saw that u posted a video :)
I passed out at the Kendall Rae reference 🥺 I love her
I need the next series now!!! So glad your back Shane

Okay wait can we talk about how terrible that taco "meat" looked? That's the spookiest thing I saw in this video
💞I'm gonna keep saying it "WELCOME BACK SHANE!" 💞
Feels like old times and I’m here for it
I was just at cheeseman park with my girlfriend, all of this completely unbeknownst to me
Long Island iced tea, cashew clusters, Shane Dawson. Yess....
I’ve missed you too Shane. Love seeing you happy and hearing your laugh!

I see the annoying thing following Shane. 😒
Tbh most of us are probably living on top of centuries old bodies, or parks or other buildings are on them too. Everywhere has been a graveyard at some point 😁
So happy Shane is back !!!! I missed him a lot youtube was not the same ...
Wish these was longer I love them and more  of them

Let’s gooooo 🔥
When i tell you i audibly screamed when i got the notification😆😆🥰🥰
Qweeeeeeeeeeen!👌🏻 so glad your back!!!!!!!
Got here quicker than covid spreading
My mom scared a lot of people after she died. She always wanted to be a ghost. I wish she would have tried to scare me, but I was the only one she didn't bother. Guess she was happy I took care of her in my home so she wasn't alone.
Too soon, still canceled.
Morgans so preeeeetty 🥰
I'm so happy he's back

“In the after life” 😭 I’m so glad to have you back 🤍
Hi
Yes, The queen lives to give us another video
Dear Shane, I'm a huge supporter and I'll watch anything you post really and do (rewatch) a lot of old videos as well.  However, these series seem to be a lot of filler content and not a lot of real action.  I'd much rather see more of your own footage - even if it's boring..than watching these appropriated clips from other videos or news clips. I just wish there was more meat n potatoes to these videos. Like I said though.. you won't lose a follower in me but I do hope you can keep elevating.  Much love from Brookly, NY xxo
Grandma is so cute and adorable!
Oh no, OMARGOSH is the BIGGEST faker in the paranormal YouTube world.
*shane posts* me: TIME TO NOT SLEEP TONIGHT!
.
*WARNING everything you're about to watch may make you question everything you thought you knew. Viewers discretion is advised.*
I’ve been looking forward to this all day 🥰
Shane...please bring the scary boys back!
BORIIING!
Thanks for coming back into my life, Shane!
Enjoyed the second as much as the first, now I’m dying for the finale😪
Canceled my ass.
Shane a scratch is from a demon it’s following you
We've missed you!!!!  😭😭
How did 30 minutes go by so fast?!
Shane you gotta make "Scandal Candles"
clicks video for ghosts. stays for soap dispensers
He knew when to come bakc right when we needed him. I'm so happy you dont understand
am I the only one that got the ad about chicken nuggets made from plants after hearing about that whole park thing
Wish Shane would go on tfil one time 🤭
I knew it was third bridge! I spent a lot of time there in high school lol
14:46  -15:09 omg shane your editing is hilarious and ridiculous at the same time.  i didnt know whether to laugh or cringe haha.    this part i almost died.
Oh yay...a new token fake laughing camera man. Original.
I can't believe he is posting again 💖
Screaming when I saw Kendal 😂🥰

Omg shane I love you and 8 missed you so much  I'm glad your back ♡~♡
Papa Bruce ready to squash tik tok is everything I love him! Don't vandalize property on his watch! 🤣
Why is every house they move into haunted my house is over 150 years old and is not haunted no house I’ve lived in has been haunted. I can’t get a ghost to save mah life 👻
THIS IS GIVING ME 2018 VIBES AND IM SO HERE FOR IT!!
WHY do I keep watching these videos before bed???
I'm so happy, literally dancing. YouTube just isn't the same without you, Shane. Everything feels right in the world now. I love you, keep on keepin' on, kween ♥️🌹💫
I'm STOKED he's back with this type of vibe... miss conspiracy shit with him... YAYYY SHANEE
I'm so glad that Shane is back I was missing him
min 3:07 dont tell me I´m the only one who saw it on the dashboard
I am 2minutes and 58 seconds into this movie. my mind is blown 🤯 yes bitch! a movie! You took the characters we know and love (which is yourselves) and you created such detailed perfect characters you created your first horror movie Shane😏 you accomplished what you set out to do from DAY 1 ✅ horror movie off your list ✅ never been so fucking frightened in my life 🙀
Not me watching this during my university class
Have not slept in 3 nights: Tonight I could have. But I up just for Shane. My health and mental state can wait 🤣🤣
Jesus Christ love you
I’m so happy that I’m barely 2minutes in and I’m already excited for part 3 😍😍😍
THANK YOU FOR POSTING AGAIN!! We have missed you! Seeing you post again has made my year and i cant wait to watch the rest of this series and more!! Much love to you and your family!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Apparition, Morgan. Not aspiration. I'm sure it was just someone misspelling it but I just wanted you guys to know the real name they use for a spirit that is basically appearing out of nowhere Also yes teen kids are stealing basically anything they can from school. One person stole a entire chalk board, a urinal, screen projector 📽️, a parking sign that said principal parking only. Letters off the school names. The most random stuff that you would definitely not think a kid could just walk out of school with it.
The stupid tiktok challage is so fucking dumb. I hate kids it happened to my school too
This is a whole thing omg I can’t believe he’s back and this video is good for the spooky season
The only thing I am mad about is the fact the video is only 34 minutes
Yes!!!
are yawl gonna hunt for the windigo
Whenever he talks to Chris I get chills because my names Chris lol
💜💜
Shane dawson literally mentioned kendall rae 😭💓
this entire video is just bait - they don't actually GO ghost hunting, they just _talk about it_ for half an hour pleeeeease get to the point
Best cinematographer on YT
AAAAH, I’ve gone to Easter service at Cheeseman park and have a membership to Botanical gardens. Great job Shane! So glad your back.
<3 <3 <3
grandma is a vibe
I love this series! Would u ever Colab with Kendall Rae again ?
Thank the lord he’s back!
Ohh, this was so good, I am already scared again 😅😅 It's midnight here, so it's even scarier 😂 I can't wait for the last part, though I'll probably watch that the next morning 😅
Shane, I love your videos but I swear to god if you don’t tell your camera man to shut the fuck up I swear down ima do something
I’m so happy that you are back and making your videos where I live ❤️❤️❤️don’t ever leave . Morgan look so gorgeous as always
Just finished it was amazing! I've missed the way you so beautifully weave a story together! It was funny, creepy, entertaining and everything we love about your brilliant storytelling/filmmaking abilities ❤ So hyped for Part 2!
Love this
LOL, I love Grandma! 💙
anyone notice the 666 likes?
Yay dads here!
❤❤❤
Greetings to the Tw*tter children. Thanks for giving Shane the views, you wannabes.
YASSSSSS!!! The King of YouTube is back! We missed you so much!
Shane gave content when every other creator rn said fuck it
Yay! Shane is back btw Shane have you used a Quija board? because if you did that could make a demon follow you
He really is amazing.  He could really do horror movies for Netflix.
yesss the second epp
Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Mine is that it's been an awful few years and I missed Shane's uploads. Period. The past is exactly where it needs to be, in the past. Just happy to see the new stuff!
Waited all week for this❗
the way he focused on the whole tiktok challenge one reminded me of his conspiracy theories
4:47 that’s my school! Yeah they just left that water fountain flooding the cafeteria
I'm so ready for this
I’m so happy you’re back 🥺
The editing. The humor. The research. Stunning. Welcome back.

So glad to have you back Shane and friends. We love you.

I kinda feel like at the start Morgan was kinda disinterested in it and definitely not like she use to be.
im so mf happy ur back 😭
When shane said “in the after life” and INSTANTLY regretted it is MEEEE in a serious situation 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He is so Shakey it's kind of annoying
I’ve been waiting for this all day
Welcome back Shane! We have misst u, and hope everything is good with u❤️
Oh em gee! Morgan gets me! I literally ask my mom the same thing! Why knock when you’re coming in anyways!
Remember all those haters that said Shane wouldnt get 1 view.    BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahhhh I’m so excited
Morgan, you’re breathtaking! 💕

YASSSSS QWEEN
Omg thank you so much for using our video! This means so much to me!! 😍
Morgan looks SO pretty!!
You NEED to bring out a horror movie
It’s all about the angelic yields. 😇👌
I'm so happy he's back!
Love u Shane always keep your head up!!!
Wait so no one is talking abt all bullshit he did and he just comes back like nothing happened? Wow.......just 😒🤦🏽‍♀️
Wow he’s back!!
YES! YES! YAAAAS!!!!
Also, Morgan is looking so pretty!! I’m on edge I need part 3 now!
The vibe is different
With what happened is kinda messed up obviously, but I genuinely love his theory vids so I’m glad he’s back
Cut to an ad for the new Sream movie. Couldn't have picked it better myself.
Love this, I'm glad Shane is back!
YASSS SHANE
What’s with all these stans in the comment section! Your literally enabling his awful behavior that he has not yet truly apologized for.
If all Shane did was ghost hunt I would watch every video
Bruce is iconic! God bless him 😂
We’re back baby
Ryland’s Dad is VERY bothered by the little A-holes destroying bathrooms 🤣 I love it, sir! So am I, so am I! 🙇🏽‍♀️
Hate me if you want but I’m glad to see him back because y’all try and cancel legit anyone everyone be soft asf for tryna cancel him. I miss when Ppl were able to take shit and not get offended by every little thing
I love how ryland's father is so mad about the TikTok trend. I also love that he knew about it and Shane and ryland didn't
I hope the next series is about the park after the finally
Grandma is soo cute!
I missed you :)
Excited to watch this!!
This could of been episode one
hearing the “drums” made my heart drop. that place is filled with sorrow. may those souls rest in peace.
Rylands family: “spooky stuff right” 👁 👄 👁  Chris the camera man: *hyperventilating* “hehe yeah” 💀
Yoooooo
yo
i wish y’all could go ghost hunting with kendall rae and her husband cuz that would be so cool but with everything that happened, i really doubt they would want to
Drop the camera man, his laugh aint it
Nice
*I really am beyond happy that Shane is back!* I still can’t get over it 💜
When it says in the finale and you get sad because you don’t know how long it’ll be between the finale and his next video 😞💕
I was waiting for this!!!!
Y’all some fake ass people but I’m just glad Shane is back💚

We need conspiracy theorys Shane!!!
I love to see that shane is back!❤ hope to see Jeffree and him soon!
the history lesson with Morgan was so interesting

I now see why Rylands dad loves Shane.. because he’s literally Shane in 30 years 😭😂😂 I love it
Shane returning marks the end of COVID

To Shane's new camera guy; keep that shit still and looking down so it doesn't give everyone double chins.   You're trying too hard to make it have a "The Office" vibe with the zoom. Cut it out.
SHANEEEE ILYSMMMMNM

it's raining so much outside and shane just posted what more could I ask of ahh
that lady really said ghosts need your energy to survive. SURVIVE?!
Yaaaasssss Shane we missed you. #fellowCancer #DON'TLEAVEUSAGAIN
To all the people complaining that shane is back and replying to people's comments. Just dont watch him. It's that simple. How is he supposed to move on if people keep bringing up his past mistakes which he apologised for years ago
👏👏👏👏👏
Shane- “I hope I don’t die” Grandma- “Yeah 😃”  😂😂😂
I’m ready for the next part 😀
Editing is amazing!! Always!
Omg your back..... Yay
I love Chris’s commentary and laughs😂
morgan’s glow up tho 😍
these added sound effects are so obnoxious and way too loud. yall need a sound mixer wtf
We love you Shane
welcome back Shane!! loving this series excited for more :)
I couldn't get home fast enough 😍
Lol!!! Shane is ready to see the world..then mention all the likely you could get murdered. (Shane ~ "Cool" )

Arapahoe county is where I lived for 7 years, I miss CO so much 😭😭
Morgan is so pretty like wtf 🤭
Devious Licks are taking over the World 😈🤌
Wait, what? Is dis a dream?
So happy to see Shane back! ❤
I'll never stop loving him, he defined my fuck up sense of humor
ok how many likes for shane to collab with sam and colby?
But I still wanna go 👀
The school destroying thing is true I work at a school kids stole a sink and now the kid is juvenile detention Center.
Finally, a content that I’ve been wanting and waiting for.
"the most important bodies were moved first" even in death there is inequality
Shane: Two thousand bodies remain
I’ve gone like 5 times and ive never seen or heard anything 🤷🏼‍♀️
Why am I watching right before going to sleep 😩😭
I insta clicked
Seek Jesus & fear no evil 🤍🙏✝️
Loveeee q spooky queen
I'm scared 😳
This 34 minutes went so fast! I've missed you so much 😭
I'm sorry, but MORGAN WHAT A GLOW UP 👏
YeEeEeEeEes lord!
KENDALL!!! ❤
Are we ever gunna found out what the name of this place is
Can we have part 3 now please?

We need to protect rylands dad at all costs. I love this man. 😂
I would love to see Shane do some sort of true crime series!
should have stayed cancelled
Welcome back Shane!
Ya never see “ghosts” dressed in plaid from like 1997. Why is that? 😂
Your the best shane
Im so glad Shane is back. I've missed YouTube.
Get the man a gimble, i cant stand the shakiness
I’ve never clicked so fast on anything in my life 🙌🏼
LETS GOOOOOOO IM SO HYPED FOR MORE SHANE VIDEOS
Dad needs his own channel. Yes I called him Dad, he’s all of our Dad now. 🤍
Can Grandma be a regular? She’s great
i love grandma!! i lost all of my grandparents and seeing her in these videos makes me smile. THANK YOU SHANE
Unsubbed. And blocked. Please save us time and leave your metro life off the internet. Ginja.
So this is another Gold Camp Road in Colorado lol? I grew up in Colorado Springs so yeah Colorado is very spiritual/paranormal. I know that they've shut down Gold Camp off and on throughout the years, even going as far back as when my mom was a teen (the 70's).
I'm with Ryland's dad, I hope the little b@stards get a little zap where it counts.
🖤
WB!
felix was right  shane would make a comeback
AMAZING! THANK YOU SHANE FOR ANOTHER PERFECT VIDEO. CAN'T EVEN PUT INTO WORDS HOW HAPPY THIS MAKES ME... 🙌💞🙌💞 LOVE YOU 💞🙌💞🙌
Absolutely love rylands dad. Wholesome.
Make conspiracy videos please
Ok but Ryland’s Dad is so funny and cute ahhaha
loved this so much!!!
Shane comes back and teaches us more than history class did. Thank you❤️
dear shane and the squad..... i love yous
Yayyyyyyyyy
Im excited for part 3
I’m here. Never left. ✌️❤️
morgan is so bad bruh
So fucking happy to have you back.. Congrats on the new/farm/lake house.. Love & light from Philadelphia ☮
I LOVE THAT SHANE IS BACK! MY LIFE IS COMPLETE AGAIN! iM SO PROUD OF HIM XO
Oh the suspense! Ugh you’re killing me. Can’t wait!
Shane: things follow me…  Morgan: did you guys know that annoying orange is back?!   Lol I died!!!!!
🙌🏻
If you don’t like Shane for things he did 5-10 years ago then don’t watch, what’s the point of being negative in the comment section that’s full of positive vibes and something called forgiveness something that’s not in this current day vocabulary I guess because of all the cancel culture and people thinking they’re perfect
The dramatic effects that aren’t meant to look fake r funny af
Ok shane came back during my most boring class 🤤 period boutta put in my airpods 😫
This is amazing... The Annoying Orange is 🍊 back 🍊
I literally can NOT express how happy I am that Shane is back   Edit: holy shit 400 likes in 2 min, thanks guys! Lol
I ordered food for this
Please people. If you do go to Third Bridge, please be respectful. There is a man who owns a farm right next to the bridge and he will come and chase you with his shotgun. People do call the cops if you linger there too long. Please please be careful for going there. It is not a place to be a tourist attraction.  Please like this for awareness
People grow. Welcome back Shane!
I've missed your videos so much shane !
I love you ❤️
Omfg I’ve missed you so much 💕We’ve been waiting 🥺
Random fact : the sand creek massacre happened the same time as the civil war
Yaaaasss I love this!!!!
this episode was better, more focused
Shane’s uploaded a video on my birthday 🥳
I think they should do a cross country ghost hunt.
Day made 🥺
Bro..you were literally in Colorado, and you didn’t come and say HI? I feel betrayed 🥺
So happy you are posting again
Can’t wait to watch this after work 😃
So glad you are back!!, Iv missed you!!!!
morgan looks so good
Love you Shane and your work is amazing
Morgan should make conspiracy theories videos 😂
I want to watch a scary video not listen to a half hour History lesson🙄 I'm sorry but this episode sucked
Lol..shane.😂.im just a big ol white man tryna show the creepy spookies!"..i love his humor😂
Yassssssss
Why is this literally the cure to my depression 😭😭
Morgan really doesn't realize how pretty she is. Like she is absolutely stunning.
I’m so happy your back Shane!!
Please fire whoever is holding the camera , i cant stand it .
Enjoyed the first part of the new series. Looking forward to this entry. Glad you're back dude.
Shane knows how to market an audience.
How is it that I have lived in Colorado for over 30 years and have never heard about the Sand Creek Massacre. So sad and tragic 😞
shane come to new orleans! perfect place to continue this series 🥰
why is the title card literally me when  i go into a depression and i come back "ive missed you"
Shane's face when Ryland said he would take girls and make out thr! PRICELESS. 28:15
I missed you so much Shane!!!!!
Yes I so needed a video like this right now! Thank you Shane 😘!!
Omg YOURE BACKKKKKK BLESSSSS THE INTERNET
I’m excited to watch this! :]
That I intro is amazing
Surely I’m not the only one thinking how beautiful Morgan is! Not saying that the others aren’t beautiful, but Morgan looks so much prettier ❤️
Excited to watch this while also watching the first snow fall of the season in Colorado! Welcome home! Spooky blessings to all! 🎃 👻 🧙‍♀️
I'm literally sick in bed. Had to go get some things at Walgreens. Now I xan lay back down n enjoy Shane.   Oh that a blessing lol.  Thanks Shane I enjoy ur videos. Thanks for coming back.
Okay but Morgan is soo beautiful !!!
Why was I notified 40 min later...... whatever I'm watching now 👀
PLS NOT THE DEVIOUS LICK
How appropriate that YouTube showed me an ad for the new Scream movie before this.
I’m surprised Shane didn’t get into Randonautica !
More more more!
Best gift for my bday is having you back!!
It's my anniversary so I won't be able to watch until later but holy crap I'm so excited!
You literally are the best at editing
Only 34 mins late and I’m ready!!
leave it to shane to make a series on something that could be condensed into a 10 minute video
Shane really should have his own Netflix Series
:)
He did this at the best time 😫
So we waited a week for a vlog…
Why must he post when I'm alone at night
Morgan looks BEAUTIFUL
He says Ryland's mom is working for nasa while wearing a nasa shirt
School custodians know
Glad you’re finally posting again Shane! You were a huge part of my life growing up. A lot of people don’t understand that humor on the internet was so fucked up 10-15 years ago. But you deserve forgiveness. Who the fuck cares what we all did. If you focus on what happened in the past or freak out about the future you’re pissing on today.
Morgan trying to say Apparition is everything!
Not the devious licks
It’s 10.30pm here in Scotland and I’ve been waiting all day for the upload 😍😍 so glad to see you back filming! x
Shane will probably never see my comments but I’m so happy you’re back! True fans will always wait for you when you take the time you need ❤️ also please don’t get killed by demons 😩
I would be lying if I didn’t say I miss these series
Sounds like there's enough haunted places to have this series be more than just for Spooky October Month. Im hoping it will continue long after😇
There are no ghosts, ONLY DEMONS. Stop being filled by these people telling you other wise.
Honestly I’m bored
Oh wow I heard native drums *begins beatboxing*
Morgan giving Kendall Rae vibes 😃
can’t wait for part three
Shanes videos are always amazing and you can tell how much time and dedication he puts into his work.
Kendall Rae stans I’m with it babyyyyy
so glad your back!!
We love it!!
I’m glad shane is back I was getting so sad watching the same videos over and over and now we have his amazingly amazing content again! So excited
No good watching this at night ahahaha
Creepy spookies needs to be a shirt now lol  Also, anyone else excited for SCREAM 5??? Preimires January 12, 2022!!
omfg yes
My body.... is ready
Rylands dad is so funny
I'm a little late...BUT LET'S GOOOO

Yesss queen❤
I wish I had family :(
I smiled for the first time in a while thx Shane
I LOVE SHANE so glad the entire gang is back.

Im happy you’re back
You’re back!!!!!!!!
When Morgan walked in I was like DAMN SHE IS GLOWING. Y’all all look so good lately❤️
Im just sad we have to wait for your next video ❤️♥️🙌 we missed you more than you could ever imagine 💋
“Oh yummy”
Wow I am lost for words this is incredible I could watch this content for ever
morgan is so pretty
Omg, this intro kinda reminded me of a Sam and colby video. I would so love to see you guys do a video with Sam and Colby it would be so much fun
Morgan is so beautiful wth 🥵
Cancelled who? :) Yay so happy you're uploading again.
I truly hope the negative comments didn’t scare Shane away from reading comments all together. I hope he sees how many people have missed his content and how much we’re loving this series.
Typical of North American history Much darker than ppl want to admit Nothing but blood on their hands HAUNT EM ALL MY ANCESTORS   Lol jk 🙄   Just good to see the truth revealing itself w. This and the residential schools coming to light. We have waited long enuff ✊🪶
I'd love to do this shit w Shane so much
Want to watch this immediately but waiting until I can snuggle in bed and watch with no distractions 🍿
can we just appreciate how good Morgan looks ?
You came back just when I ran out of Shane videos to watch
🙈🙈🙈
YAY
People talk shit but still watch the WHOLE video
I always be looking through the comments to see if anyone is hating but it’s all positive.
SO EXCITED !!
I am so glad he is back. I also love how he mentions everyone he uses down in the description box so u can go check it out yourself.
Shane on the "The Sip" saying he needs inspo to post again.... span to a couple weeks later and he comes out with a BANGER OF A SERIES and WE👏🏼ARE👏🏼HERE👏🏼FOR 👏🏼IT!!
I can't wait for conspiracy theories. It's been too long. 😭
Not much of a trend mfs been vandalizing the bathroom since before I was in hs
please link w kendall rae
Can we all acknowledge how beautiful Morgan is?
AHHHH I'M SO EXCITED!
He came back when the world needed him the most.
I'm so scared and so exited
*Mr Ballin, Shane & Kendall Rae* all uploaded today so fucking blessed by alll 🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡
I so exsited
I got me a bowl of icecream and I am so ready!!!! So happy your back!!! I actually get excited to see a video being posted again!!!!
Yes! So thankful for you Shane!❤️
I definitely think you should get some of the equipment and see if any of spirits speak to you
I literally live for these videos
please keep postinggg !
I know everyone hates him but i love this type of videos and i think it was time
At the sand creek Massacre there was also records of the soldiers wearing body parts as trophies as well as cutting out unborn fetuses from pregnant natives and wearing the dismembered fetuses
Wow shocked to see a video post awesome.
Ryland's dad/ stepdad? is so adorable, I love him!
The queen is back!!!!!
Posted.  Clicked.  Watched.  Loved
SO GLAD YOU ARE BACK MY KING
right when i saw the notification i clicked it! missed him sm!
The king is back!! 👑👑👑👑
Yall forgetting the disgusting shit this man did it’s embarrassing
I was hoping you still upload. I love you shane no matter what.
Im paciently waiting for morgan to post on her channel
Dzaaamn....i clicked so fast SHANE.
I don’t necessarily believe in spirits or ghosts, but I know building a park on top of a graveyard is wrong on so many levels
Ryland used to be a skeptic now look at him 😂 welcome back shane we've missed you too ❤️
And a bunch of white kids exploiting native land for a pay check.
15:33
The old Shane is BACK !!! 🥳
YAYYY I love you Shane
So wild how he is getting such overwhelming support. These YouTubers can legit do anything and take a few months off and they come back and everyone of there fans has amnesia
Sorry but rylans dad needs his own channel 1part - building 2nd part hus take on the world news.
OH FUCK YAAA
DUDE i love seeing this. went to third bridge when i was in High school definitely was a place that everyone went to
can morgan and rylands family adopt me pls
Love Shane, but Ryland' s dads obsession with tiktok trends is weird. Imagine being an older guy, and a father, and your main thing in life is watching videos of kids trashing school bathrooms.
Oh I’ve missed you Shane
OMG 😂😂 I love Bruce Even more now after he said the little shit… 😂
Literally on my lunch break, what perfect timing, welcome back Shane ❤️❤️
They are stealing things from schools, not just destroying things in bathrooms. At one school, a kid jumped in a school bus and drive it around before he got out. Smh.
Shout out Kendall Rae 🙌
just what i needed <3
I really shouldn't watch this at 11:31 pm 🙃
I've never clicked on anything so fast! I'm so happy you're back! Im proud of you.
No
MORGAN LOOKS STUNNING!!!!!
LETS GOOOOOO
You're back!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤😊
Just finished a 3 hour assignment....I am so ready to watch this!!!!!  Thank you for making my life less dull!! <3
I WAS STALKING AND NOW IM EARLY YESS
The cemetery made into a park 😲 when my grandma died, my grandpa asked the cemetery a million crazy questions and one of them was "what happens if this place is no longer profitable and you sell it to some realtor to build condos, will my family be able to take the bench and cremation holder stone"(we bought burial plots but they both wanted to be cremated so it's this headstone that holds the urn inside) and we all burst out laughing, because it was such a absurd concern. The cemetery worker was like "we've been here for 80 years, nobody is going to build condos or A PARK or anything over the cemetery"
What happened to cheeto?
Iiving for this series !
Bruce is talking about devious licks LMAOOOOO
Grandma is my spits it animal. “Do you know what they are talking about grandma?” “No” hahaha
WOOT SHANES BACK!!!!🎉🙏👏💖
Ive Never clicked on something so fast in my entire life.
Aww Rylands parents dogs are soooo cute Shane I’ve truly truly truly missed you I been watching you for 8 years and I read both of your books😍😍😍
i like that Shane came back doing what he likes the most, horrors, after pulling through all the pressure and reflecting on himself
cant wait
OMG THE KENDALL RAE SHOUT OUT 😭
I never cared about the stupid drama, I just want to be ENTERTAINED THROUGH SOME GOOD CONTENT!!! Glad Shane is back :)
“You can do it, Shane.” She either has the best or the worst understanding of Shane’s online career.
So great to have you back man
yesss part 2 im all hyped up now
You won’t die, the camera man never dies in movies😂
Shane, i missed your videos. Always make me laugh :)
when the world needed him the most, he came back
18:37 idk who this is but i love him already 🤣
When I was 4 years old I ran off into a cemetery and seen a man on his knees crying to a stone head. I went over and started crying and comforting the man. My parents and brothers grabbed me and asked me “what are you doing, there’s nobody there” I was sure and stayed. I was never walked through there again. Years later that man sat on the end of my bed, he went to speak to me so I turned over and went back to sleep. To this day he follows me x
Beginning to really love Friday mornings! (Australian here 🇦🇺) Loving the new content! 💜🖤💜🖤
Lol I love how ryland's dad is so concerned about the tik tokers
I LOVEEE kendall rae lol 😆
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 Find Brian, for us, Shane!!!!!!!
My new comfort videos, for sure 😭❤️
WELCOME BACK  and  PLEASE  PLEASE PLEASE NEVER LEAVE FOR THAT LONG AGAIN
Fuck yes. This is exactly what I needed to see. I was stressed as fuck 😂
California is very toxic!! I live here, and I agree 😬
Ryland’s dad is literally the best.
I’m actually scared to watch this video by myself
Yaaaasss!!!
😟
We cancelled cancel culture.....🇺🇲 welcome back Shane.
At my school when the devious lick was really popular, they pulled the fire alarm and we were outside for 30 minutes. The whole school schedule was messed up lol
Drama or not, I do think Shane, Ryland, and Morgan moving back to Colorado was a good idea for their mental health in the long run.
i'm so glad he's back idgaf what y'all say he deserves a 2nd chances unlike other youtubers
i mised you
Yo Shane! I’m in colorado too! I love it here. If ya need a friend in Denver, I’m here! 🤗
It feels so good that I can expect a video from Shane. It's been so long and I am so happy he is back.
Missed these documentaries man
Seeing the "Shane Dawson posted" notification makes me so happy
Okay but why does Morgan look better in her sweats than me dressed up to the nines?!?!?!
Welcome back! We missed you!!
I love you too much
sooooooooo, miss Shane! Love it. Thanks for the great video.
The moment the video came out I switched on all my lights to watch 👀👀👀
You guys should bring along a medium to see what’s following you, Amanda reye I think is how you spell it but she is a great medium
YES IM READY
Shane you are my comfort spot, I feel like at one point this feeling is going to be nostalgic! Miss you  💖
ANOTHER NEW VIDEO ALREADY? 🎉
Morgan is so gorgeous 😍
This is the Shane content I missed
I feel whatever is attached to Shane is a negative spirit however I need to meet him in person or do a video call in order to assess this I can communicate with the spirits emotionally so until I meet Shane I won’t know I’d love to meet and get to know everyone
i absolutely love this series, damn im so excited i count down the days and hours until he posts again!!<3 love you Shane I'll always watch your content mwah!!<3
I have missed you as well!!!!!!
F@ck cancel culture! Yeahhhhh for Shane being backkkk!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
We waited a year and a half for just a continuation of the last few videos . Lmfao
I’m so happy you’re back, please don’t ever leave again 🥺 you were one of the first Youtubers I’ve ever watched. You and your videos have been a part of my life for almost a decade.. I missed you and I’m glad you’re back 😊❤️
Shitza
I got chips and dip. I’m ready
The devious licks thing is so stupid.
I love you Shane!!!!
Let's  goooooooo. New chapter brother !!!
y'all switched your opinions on him real quick. yikes
This is the Shane I fell in love with (his vids)
So I'm finally watching it and I see why you fell in love with ryland, he's great and his family is great.. more like perfect for you and how you are. I love this for you my guy. 💯🏁
The background music is TOO LOUD
Eeekkwkekekek ❤️❤️❤️
I’m ✨living✨ for Ryan’s dad😭🤣👏🏽
HELLO
welcome back
IM SO EXCITED OMG WAIT
I love how the people who hate Shane are always so quick to comment... like we know you have notifications on 💀😭 why are you watching?
I am normally one for second chances however the comments toward an underage girl about her period is a bit past my boundaries of what can be forgiven. 💁‍♂️ let's see if this last
So why is that pic cencored? 🧐 interesting content en spooky🤯
Thank you for coming back💖💖💖
please stop trying to come back
The music at the start sends me😂😈😍😍
Hi Shane! Good work.
Shane posts. I automatically LIKE! 🔥💛✨
when i tell you i screamed when i refreshed youtube
Favorite time of the day❤️ ohhh how I’ve missed this
Yassssss💃❤🙌🏽 so excited for this series!
i’m so happy you’re back
I'm happyyyyyyyy
NO BC I WAS LITERALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW I MISSED THESE VIDEOS
missed these so much
I couldn't wait for this all week ; )
WAIT WHAT!!!!!
Wow Morgan glowed up
I INSTANTLY got snacks and plopped
so glad you're back!  throw us a bone and give us a random trying on girl products or conspiracy video for old times sake?
i m r e a d y y y
Omg Morgan is gorgeous!!!! Btw loooove this series
I haven't even watched part 1 yet 👀 I better catch up
YESSSS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Waahh😫 i knew u were gnna post right when my kids came home from school. Now i gotta wait till later tonight to watch in peace
This is too frickin creepy,my heart was pounding so fastly✋
Man I missed this
I was watching the other one like 30 mins ago and was hoping for this one soo
Ryland's dad is SOO CUTEE
I agree with Bruce this Tik Tok trend is a real issue!
Guy: *licks battery* hmm....dead...Like the massacre victims.....SO ANYWAY -
i had a dream today where i was watching a tape of people dying in caves and my face was put on their body parts.
LOVE YOU SHANE!
you cure my depression
Yes ur back best day ever
Why would cemeteries be haunted? It's not like the people died there? Sure, they are creepy but idk why the spirts of those bodies would haunt the area. If these things were true why would you bury your loved ones and essentially trap them there with these other souls.
Finally, let's goo
So excited for the next video! ❤️❤️ On another note, I didn’t know about that stupid TikTok trend. How awful, they should be held accountable for damages at least. I hate when there are dumb trends like that.
These videos help me to not think about the past with my ex😭😭 I love you Shane!
He is back when we needed him the most
Why isn't this a Netflix Series
Omg I had the worst fucking day- this is making it so much fucking better 😭♥️
OMG SHANE IM ONLY 2 MINUTES INTO THIS AND I ALREADY LOVE IT 😍 💕
I MISSED YOUUUUU BESTIE 😩
I can't wait to not sleep tonight! Shanes videos need to be a Netflix series, fr
You have no idea how much I needed you and this. Thank you for coming back.
Liked before I even watched it lol

I waited so long for this
Parts of this felt like I was watching paranormal activity for the first time lol
I'm so glad he's back and giving us these kinds of videos again
Not me forcing myself to watch something scary even though I hate horror just because it’s Shane
Shane I just want to say , Thank you for coming back .. seriously you don’t know how miserable I am these days and your videos always helps me to forget about my problems and just laugh with you 💜 I always loved you ! and I’ll always will 💜 thank you again and I hope you have a wonderful day 💜  Welcome back .

Rylands parents give very much republicans vibs. Especially the dad
14:27 that is really scary but...THATS WHAT SHE SAID!
Thank you Shane for making my day!

Lmfao, why do people think ghosts are more active at night?  Like if there's a real spirit there, day vs. night doesn't matter hahahahahah
I missed you all I've been watching all your videos It's like you all are raised from the dead
Bruce is a legend 😂
Morgan looks soooo good!!!
Shane i just want you to know, I don’t like scary movies or watching them but for you, I will go to the movies to get scared.
The whole family is so funny and Morgan is an icon ☺️
I’m living for this come back. I swear i have been so depressed since you’ve left youtube. I’d check weekly to see if you came back yet. & here we are!!
This “series” sucks. I feel like I’m in kindergarten
I just farted lol
I heart u Shane...and Ryland too! 🥰
I missed you so much words cannot describe, have been watching your other videos over and over! I'm so glad you're back.
I wanted it to be longer 😩😩😩

Heck yes. Glad to see you back buddy
Love Ryland dad lol, and not a good idea watching this a night,  it 10.24pm here at the mo in the uk
Yay!🤗
If you want to make videos of haunted places....how can I believe you is real?????..because you make horror movies. I want to see honest videos even if nothing extraordinary happen. I want to trust you ❤️

IV MISSED YOU TOO
Sheesh!

This gives me life
Hi hi hi hi hi
Yay!!!!! I’ve been waiting for this one!
Hey Shane! My kids and I have been watching since day one! ☺️ okay so,  my Son is 22 and my Daughter is 12. Tried to explain to my 12 year old that her older brother and I used to watch all of your movies 🎥 🍿  While she argues with me that Shane Dawson never made any movies Mom! 🙄 So yeah we basically watched you grow up on YouTube. And my children have grown up with you too.  We’ve always supported you my dear. Wish you the best because as fans from the very beginning we have always have known that your a down to earth, and kind genuine person. Were here no matter what you decide to do.  Much love ❤️ and support Shane. 😌☺️🥰
Shane returning to YouTube makes me feel life can get back to somewhat normal again. I missed him so much! 🫂
Glad to see you back Shane!!
I was just watching the other video and I refresh and see this
Ive been waiting all day for this.. aaaahah 💜💜

WE MISSED U SHANE 🧡
BRUCE IS JUST KING PERIOD DIDNCJSIOS

The 310 people that dislike the video are miserable people that hate themselves!!! Thanks for the view though lol!!!!
Relating to the whole TikTok vandalism challenge.. I work at a Subway and we’ve now had three wet floor signs stolen by the same kid in the last week and were like… wtf… we think it may be for TikTok lol

Beyond thankful and grateful you are back Shane! Your videos keep me sane on my worst days and make me even happier on my good ones! Seeing you back actually gives me hope for the mess that YouTube has turned into! Keep doing things that make you happy and never stop being you because not only just I love you so many people do ❤️❤️❤️🍭🍭
hello super glad your back !!
Yaaay Shane so good to see this
I'm going through a really rough time in my pregnancy. I'm 33 weeks and my pregnancy has gone downhill bad. This is what I needed to put a smile on my face 💜
IM SO HAPPY
I needed you the whole pandemic 😩
Yes HES BACKYOY
Morgan is so beautiful omg
this isn’t the YouTube come back I wanted. But I guess it’ll suffice.... I guess.  Ps we really want Jenna Marbles
The destruction trend is called  "devious licks"
YAASSSS!! Feels like it's been longer than a week!! Can't wait to get through this whole series I'm so curious! Hope you and Ryland are doing well settling in! 🖤💚
I live for watching stuff like this im really into the Paranormal and these kind of videos actually inspire me. It might sound crazy to some but with paranormal youtubers i watch. When Authentic its so peaceful. It can be negitive energy sometimes and thats why you take specific mesures to unsure your safety.
Wait... What?
"Did they just run out of dance moves?" 😆
As long as Shane posts, I will click on it every single time 👏 💕
All the colorado natives knew 3rd bridge was where they were going. But tbh i drive over 3rd bridge several times a month and never seen or heard anything 🤷‍♀️
I’m so excited!!!
Literally, I love you so much I didn’t realize you were cancelled. I thought you were just taking a break.
Early gang 😀
Shame on the mayor of this city. 😕 good job Shane for getting this out there. It is bullshit to desecrate burial grounds.
But if he were black, ijs. Aint no take a year vacation and come back like nothing happened
Lmao Omar 🤣

It’s suppose to be bedtime for me in the UK, looks like I’m not sleeping tonight😳😭
With Shane now living in Colorado, is his PO box still the same? 🤔

That was so sweet at around 3:30 minutes, Ryland opened the door for Shane. 🥰
There's a old asylum right by my house called Eloise and a few miles away is this empty looking overgrown field. If you know where to find it, it's hundreds of graves of people who died in the hospital, the graves were just marked with little bricks with numbers etched and most of the bricks have been stolen or moved. It's tragic.
I guess its time for full screan and snack now. 👌
Cheeseman Park is sooo haunted. Let's go! 🤭
YES
Hype
Just in time! * I’m about to clock out for the day *
Shane if you need any advice on protection let me know
When I say Shane’s videos bring me happiness, I mean it. Have been looking forward to your return ❤️
Shane HASSSS to do a video on Savannah Georgia, all of the parks downtown are built over massive mass Graves of people
I missed you SHANEEEEE
Oooh... I'm gonna watch this series so many times... and I'm so ready to enjoy it every damn time!!
I forgot you were posting today !!!!!!!! 💙💙💙💙💙
Shane, I literally cannot wait until you start making horror films like you want to. Your last couple videos have had some outstanding editing that really gives them a film like quality to them.
Love to see it

Shane, it is so good to see you back! All that hate that you got before was completely and utterly not deserved.

You are such an amazing, special person and I’m glad to have you back!!   💛💛😊😊🎥✌🏻
Hell yeah!!!!!!!! I missed this so much 🤩

Im just so happy you’re back 🤩 love your videos!!
Why is the intro the scariest fucking music I've ever heard?
I’m so proud of you for never giving up! Needed this notification today ♡
literally just finished the first one, saw the second one came out today, changed mdt to central time, saw it came out right now lmao.
Seen Shane posting get me so excited.
I love this 🤌✨
Love you Shane! ❤
I used to live in aurora. It’s a…. place 😬
Would rather have an regular conspiracy video..
why why why
As soon as Shane post I click immediately love you Shane your videos are awesome
ok got my milk and cookies… im ready to be scared😮‍💨
So glad you’re back Shane
i sat here refreshing and ended up being 7 minutes late 🥲
Omg the devious licks- 💀💀💀💀
seeing Shane happy gives me hope of a better tomorrow. I've been struggling mentally and physically for years and then losing my mom broke that last straw I was hanging to. I've lost interest in living and yet I couldn't end things myself because I know that's not what she would have wanted me from me so I Decided to work on myself and be a better version of myself to make her proud . so seeing Shane happy and productive is telling me that no matter what there's always a rainbow after rain and light after darkness and I'm looking forward to heading towards the light at the end of the tunnel. Also seeing him posts again after much much time puts a smile on face and I'm genuinely happy .💗 I love you 💗
Kids destroying stuff for tik tok so american come to Europe we are smart and keeped in 'leash' I mean we were raised the righ way
IM SO HYPED
Oo yayy! Here before the 100k views
I haven’t even watched it and I already clicked on the like button 🥰❤️
Yasssssssssssssssss I’ve been waiting all day for this 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
This reminds me of the “anaesthesia awarness and lucid dreaming videos shane would do but compiled into 1”
only three minutes in and already wishing pt. 2 was longer
Daddy
Yeees, what I need
I’ve missed you more
SHANEEEEE, I LOVE YOU SO SO SO SO MUCH, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK❤️
hi shane i’m in 4th period rn
My mans back on his grind 😍 We fucking love you Shane!!
I WAS JUST REWATCHING THE LAST ONE BC I MISSED YOU AND THIS POSTED IM SOOO HAPPY 😍😍😍
I remember 3 years ago when I saw the Stanley hotel video and I was so fascinated and I loved it and now Shane is upping his game going somewhere else and I’m finally going to the Stanley in a few weeks! Thank you for the memories Shane, you basically raised me 😂
God the amount of people still supporting him is astonishing and plain weird. Not surprised most of them are American lol.
I get a notification from Shane I click immediately, ik I’m not the only one
HES FUCKING ALIVE
All I saw was "Shane uploaded"  and "Haunted Theories" I was all in!!! I couldn't push play fast enough...lol!!! Shane I've missed you and your videos!!!
Rylands dad is a whole mood lmaooo
Love you buddy🙏   Knew you'd be back. You're not a quitter🙏 Be you and fuck the people who have something negative to say about it🙏
After 1 year you are back, I'm sooooo happy about that 💖 I was coming to your channel so often just to see if you were back, so happy about this 🥳
don't usually watch anyone on youtube, but will always love this guys uploads, so I'm hyped that he's uploading again. The content and humour here is absolutely incredible.
i hope Shane makes an “End of the world theories” video because likeeee is it me or time feels shorter? i fear a lot more now about my life & i  don’t know why… so weird
we love you shane
Damn we all this early lol we were waitin on this🤣🤣🤣  Side note: omg they watch Kendall Rae too! Lol
Ik my one like doesnt matter that much but I'd like to think it does because I dont like anyone elses videos
Omg yes the tiktokers!! Someone stole an entire water fountain at my daughters school. A whole ass WATER FOUNTAIN!
Eek! I'm so happy he's back, people hate me for supporting him but I rather them hate me for it than having people talk behind my back for liking him. Shanes my father figure, smd if you got a problem with it
I am so excited and happy that you are uploading again!!!!! We’ve missed you😭
I’m glad you back Shane! We missed you! 🥰
Its always amazing whenever Shane uploaded his video! You know its going to be on trending AGAIN!!!! 😍😍😍 take that haterssss!

my life feels complete now that he's back. that's what was missing. it was him all along.

Ily
I’m from Colorado, in Aurora and I grew up knowing about this place for so long. All the tales and stories, in high school I finally went and the car I was in shut off. No battery. Gas was gone. Drained. Most horrifying experience I’ve ever had.

Havent even watched the whole video yet and im READYyy
I’m happy you’re back. The people who believe you can’t grow from your old old old mistakes- probably have one too many demons in their own closet.  AND- guys that really be how the internet use to be like… things have changed clearly and wed all agree we’re happy to learn, but you can’t pick one person and slaughter them for making the old ass jokes all we use to make.
Yesss I have freaking missed your videos so much
👀
ahhhh I love you shaneee
Posted 1 minute ago and comments from 3 minutes ago 🧐 regardless, HI KING
Haven't watched yet, but I already know it's going to be good.  ♥️🐷♥️🐷♥️ So glad you're back!
i’ve missed these videos so much!!!!🥰🥰🥰
I miss you making videos on YouTube
glad to see everyone again 😂🤍 long time no seeee
:)
welcome back shane
it’s been a while. this makes me happy
So excited, I'm so happy that I got to be early for once
As someone who watched Shane as my comfort in my early teens, I don't think anyone will truly understand how much I needed him to come back. I just felt the same content in my heart receiving the notification for his upload.  And to anyone who does not forgive him, just do not watch his videos and live on in your life.
Butt
SHANE SHANE SHANE SHANE  ( bill nye theme style) LOVE YOU SHANE !!
Oh gee im early, I cant wait for those youtube "tea spilling" commentary channels to overuse this
