Listen to WWE’s Out of Character podcast: http://sprtspod.fox/OOC
what are they even talking about the lakers won tonight
Shannon Contradicts himself every show! Skip does as well! They should call this contradiction instead of undisputed!
😂😂😂
"It's just the preseason."   🤦‍♂️
It doesnt matter if they are hof players or role players or best friends or a rookie...you cannot force pieces that do not fit or work together to all a sudden work as a championship level team. Its that simple. Lakers gotta figure out who fits and who doesn't and fast!
Yeah  fuc the faker 😂🤣🤣🤡lol
Hey just run the Triangle offense lmao 😆😆😆😆
These players can't make a team. Leave it up to the coaches. You had your chances
Cast of dozens .. nobody can drop like skip …. Players that are a dime a dozen 😆
Lebron does not have high basketball iq and he is not the best passer in basketball
Shannon is concerned….this isn’t good
Tf yall expect lollll. The players that already played together looked good. Ion like rondo and westbrook at the same time. Westbrook gotta get comfortable. Lakers just gotta work on defense
😅😅😝😝😝
The flopper is lame asf anyway!!! The lakers  are doomed.  NO MORE RINGS. JUST SWITCH REAMS FOR RINGS AS USUAL 😂😂😂😂🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
this is bout to be epicly horriable for my lakers smh !!!!!!
It’s the preseason, this is what it’s for.
they should have kept Caruso
Guys they was only getting a good run in they not trying to go hard for no preseason.  We cannot judge this team from preseason.
LAKESHOW = SHITSHOW 💯
What kind of fire drill Mr. Sharp?
Do Skip think pre season games count?
Clowns speaking about others clowns.
They will learn to play together in a season or two. 😂
Shannon: "I saw things that got me like; damn! Imma hate to be dealing with Skip after these type of games."  Skip: "yep, you're about to deal with me right now!" 💀🤣🤣  This show is gold 🌹
Lakers gonna spend the whole season "trying to figure it out" then lose in the 2nd round of the playoffs.
trade russ for a specialist. shooter or defender.
IT left Cleveland half way through the season and they still made the finals. Get Russ out of there
On the flip side of this coin if GSW plays like this there bench is a problem.
Coz lebum's team wherever he goes, does not develop players. He get players from other teams
"He treats it like a football." 😂😂😂😂😂😂
They both need the ball it will b issues .Russ can spaz out ppl. Skip reasons  why kd left okc remember ball issues with russ .russ acting out
they never show the plays that they talk about.?
I never see Rus fitting in .  Let's see of they can build some chemistry by the halfway point in the season
Not going.....to work!!! Skip is completely right!!
This team can go two ways throughout the season, unstoppable force, or epic disaster.
Lol Lakers won't make playoffs just like Lechina first season with Lakers lol
Is gonna be a long season for Shanon.
If this team is trash, Russell Westbrook shouldn’t go down in history as a top player at all. I personally think he’s trash. He’s a player who ruins teams. But when he has a team with one of the best leaders lebron, one of the best big men we’ve seen in a LONG time in AD, and then someone who has learned his roll later in his career in Carmelo. If you can’t mesh with those guys you are fkin TRASH
What happen to watching the sports shows to see the highlights of the game. Now it’s just talk radio basically.
Shannon said something key at 1:06 - 1:11. Westbrook try things he shouldn't try. Thunder, Rockets, Washington now the Lakers. If Westbrook could not win with Durant 🤔 What is he going to do with an aging Lebron?  🤔
Why is this the only shop that we never see what they are looking at.  Cant afford it or what.
Like I said everybody can’t be ball dominant
The Lakers are so bad right now that even Skip is complementing Lebron.
Lol
Lebron is the leader is turnovers every year in the play offs. Either leads his team or the league
Ruh the Russ remind me of Soulja’s “Draaaake?”
Wow Skip really wears all that bitterness from all his years on his face. Dude looks awful
Jokic is currently the best passer in the NBA
Lakers are bad they won’t win a title the west is to strong queen James is done
Everyone has been conceding to Labron his whole career let's not forget  he's lost more chips than he's won HE'S NOT A TOM BRADY
The warriors had 20 in their last preseason game against the blazers and still blew them out it's the by product of a high motion offense experience on other teams doesn't bring cohesiveness
This whole show is laughable just like the lakers Labron sees the freight train coming that is the GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
Nba anybody please let them put the plays on the screen its like  they're looking at a wall
2 days later and u see em post a video saying they a championship team LOL
U can't  win without defending.
Skip take wild long to get to the point sometimes 😂
Hey Shannon, you look really nice today!!😘
And and and …to to tooo…🤭
Them new 711 sandwiches really be messing me up  at night 🚽😢
These comments will be even funnier after the Lakers win the title again.
i pray in Jesus Almighty name, We Rebuke and Cutting the Lossing Games; God bless a Victories for every Game, The La Lakers Team... Amen...
The Lakers won’t make the playoffs because of injuries
I think Melo is more of the big3 than Russ
preseason… relax
Wait, didn’t Sharpe say earlier that Russ was the missing piece??? Now it’s changing….
LMAO. LeBum WHO!? It’s a joke man. He set up an old team in a young man’s league. 😂💀
Protect the football 😂😂  That looked like a Sam Darnold pass  They both definitely hope he watches and he knows that he’s trippin
Big 3 what big 3, MELO MUST NOT PLAY FOR THE LAKERS, CAUSE AINT NO WAY HE NOT GETTING NO RECOGNITION
Lakers have a big 6
WEST COULD BE A 6 MAN ? RONDO IS THE FLOOR GENRAL
RONDO IS THE KEY WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING CHAMPIONSHIP
No highlights while talking be hilarious sometimes... Like we wanna see also
Lakers are old and unwatchable. These shows can talk Bron and Brady all day if they wish, but it won’t change the fact of how old they are and the failing interest they bring. Rating don’t lie.
Shannon loves lebron james.
3:29 “I always say sometimes I think that I can make into the basketball hall of fame because the criteria seems to be very low…”  -Skip Bayless    Also Skip Bayless: Averaged 2 points during his senior year & called himself Pistol Pete….
Raleigh Simmons Coached by Fred Tex Winter. Rusell needs to play the 2 Guard and let Rondo and Kendrick bring the ball up. LAKERS NEED TO PLAY THE GAME OF BASKETBALL. Lebron RUN THE LANES and let the point guards do their jobs. Lakes can come to gather in about 25-35- games there will be NO EXCUSES. Stay healthy. AM..... I.. R.......IGHT?
Lakers need more shooters
😂😂😂
Say it one time with me. PRESEASON.
I see alot of ppl who watched 1st take convert over to Undisputed in the comments🤔
Russ doesn’t seem to fit in anywhere
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless.//
This team is not good. They just a bunch of names on one team. It's time for LeBron to retire. All he doing is taking players and making teams. It's making the NBA worst and less competitive
LeBron need to sacrifice,  he's old anyways.
It is quote "pre-season" smh....  is this why you are no longer on espn 🤔
Yall really need to show the highlights in these videos when you're watching them.
RUSS !
When Dwight was pushing ,shoving and laughing when he played for Orlando the media thought it was a bad thing then. Now the media love it when he does it
"BIg 3"
LET'S LET THEM GET TO THE 10TH GAME.
I was waiting for Skip to mention Ben Simmon's Utah game :)
He's the Turnover King...When are they going to crown him?  Legfrod is about to be number 1 in the history of the Association..
I will never get used to not having the highlights running while they talk about them
The Lakers lost against a team that had no star player playing on the Warriors smh. Skip stay wilding on Russ lol
Imagine, everyone knows this wouldn't work... Just like in Houston... But everyone just expects it work. A point guards that's bad dominant turnover heavy and can't shoot threes will never work...
"I don't know why my baby let Russ come to his team" -leshannon Sharpe James
The most awkward hall of fame speeches will be  Carmelo "all I wanted to do was shoot" anthony  &   Russell "my iq never matched the speed at which I played the game" Westbrook
What is LeShannon going to do once lebron retires should he still be on the air? Is he going to finally become objective when it comes to basketball?
Whenever LeShannon says lebron's name, he should just say "my baby" instead Because we all know that's what he really means anyway
It's just Preseason games.! No problem.!
They will figure it out for sure.
Skupp is just waiting for shay to stop talking. To burn the lakers Anderson lol. Oii
Stop playing Lakers n4...blowouts and beatdowns coming soon to a hoop near you.... watch ...ijs lmao peace
Shannon: "Just take care of the football..the football? The Basketball." Skip: "He treats it like a football."  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LeBron the self proclaimed GOAT need to pick 20 more team mates
You expect Westbrook to get more wiser as he ages but he’s just getting stupider and stupider with his decision making
Shannon I feel your pain
Westbrook never made sense there. There's too much 'Iverson' in him. He needs to be able to 'improvise.' But he can't do that on this team.
I kinda wish they could have russ lead the second unit. No way it happens but imagine him coming off the bench. Would rip through a ton of benches
"We're literally losing everyday"- LeBozo James
Damn it's over already huh it's only preseason 🤣
Can your moderators of the UNDISPUTED Youtube Channel start posting the replays that Skip and Shannon are watching during these conversations in the youtube videos? Is it really that hard? It's been years and years of Skip looking at a monitor talking about some replays and we don't see what he's talking about, what they're commenting on. Come on now.
The problem is lequeen! His not going to le no one else control the ball and do there jobs because of lequeen.. I always hated lequeen his not LAKER material ive said, Just remember how he gives up like he did on ther teams he did that last year, His a drama queen i hate him like no other i hope he gives up and retires soon we dont need him, The bubble championship was not a clean season I hope Lakers do well its been my team since I was born but I hate lequeen, If I ever see him on the streets that will be his last day
It's time for Lebron to start the farewell tour. He WILL NOT stop holding the ball and will not move the ball fast enough.  Lebron is a flow buster...If I'm AD, I've got to get away from Lebron because he wont take a lesser role for the sake of winning and staying in the game....
It might take 4 to 10 weeks & all Russ gotta do is push the ball, get them in position to score easy
Once they build chemistry it’s OVER
Let's face it, LeBron and Russel are out of theirs primes, the youth in the NBA will out play them in the long run this season.... remember I told you first.
Its because there old less movement off the ball.Which causes the opposite team to use more energy on defense.There playing one on one basketball.They will lose against talented younger teams.its part of the reason Westbrook won't benefit playing with older players and will turn the ball over because there's no one moving without the ball.
They got a coach, he needs to 🚶 step up and coach this B.S.
Y’all real all dumb if u thinks the Lakers not goin to go crazy it’s a genius plan they look horrible during the preseason duh it’s all smart thinking watch when it counts it’s goin to be different
I really don’t care for the Lakers. It’s Preseason. Don’t over think it. They’ll get it together when it really matters.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him "go and sin no more"-Jesus
Dumb laker fan boys actually have hopes for this 2nd rate team.
Big three?? More like big two and an overrated ball hog
I think it should be Rondo, Westbrook, melo lebron AD / Dwight
Skips right but u gotta remember that it is still preseason
its just the preseason
Carmelo thinking he back in OKC with Russ lol
This is pre season or am I tripping  ?😂😂😂😂
Skip You couldn’t beat your way out of a wet paper bag 🤫
“That looked like a Sam Darnold pass” -Skip Bayless 🤣🤣🤣
They need a salary cap 600,000 per year for the most skilled players.  Money doesn't effect performance. The taxpayers paid for these stadiums and ticket prices should be cheaper.  They buy multi million dollar homes made out of stucco, foam and chicken wire. Lower wages wouldn't hurt their quality of life.
Rigged,rigged and rigged
The LeOlds not winning nothing.
It's not going to look like the team everybody's hoping for, cause outside of a few bench players, none of these old head's can shoot consistently...  Until they address this, they'll just be a good team, with a bunch of old dudes.
I love Russ but I’m sorry rondo needs to start
Westbrook not gone be feeding bron like wade hope he knows
How u expect labron in Russell to mix not a got mix
Lmaoo skip be doing alot
Iverson dribbled a football 🤷🏾‍♂️
Skips the only media member that wouldn't bow down and lick Lebron's sneakers.
Russ - turns ball over Shannon - Russ why? Russ - why not?
I'm curious if ledrama doesn't make the finals this year will he consider retiring?? He'll be going on 20 yrs in the league next season, what is he trying to prove??? Does he want to break Kareems record??
The chef didn't play and they still beat those overrated fakers  Next week it starts for real
RW and CA Cancer to any team .. Lakers ain't going nowhere..
Why skip have to talk about the cowboys in every videos?
Man ya knew Lakers weren’t doing much this season. Bron winning another ring but not this year.
🦝🧛🏻‍♂️
Bet skip will be in the 'i told you so," about Russ 😂
PREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE UHHHHH NEVERMIND
Lebron should’ve kept Kyrie.. Iz over with
What TF is turnover fever?   I like Cherry 🍒
Skip keeps sniffing. Wtf. Annoying.
@0:16. Skip holding it in with GREAT effort.
The first 5 games is there first impressions of there true identity.
LBJ is a ring chaser building super team to win a championship, lookin at the easy way out the NBA is getting soft.
It's preseason....give it some time and things will start flowing and piecing together. Just like when LeBron James went to Miami. The first season was rough at the beginning then things clicked
14:32  KD said: Sorry I can´t do it with him blah blah blah 😴 Skip can preach it how often he wants, it won´t excuse the biggest coward move in Team Sports history!
LeBron has never adjusted his game to fit others, it's always been the other way around.  Russ will need to adjust his game to fit LeBron's playstyle.  He will need to play off-ball.
These non skipping ads killing me
That's why KD left Russ
Am I the only one that jus be thinking "Skip get to the DAMN point"......
Damn that’s one fly suit mister sharpe

If kd don’t get hurt it’s over he will win the championship
They is not winning the big chip
They still need help
What company has paid the largest criminal fine?//
100% disagree with Skip's take on Westbrook's ego. Every NBA player has an ego to some degree, but his is minor compared to other high-profile NBA players. You don't play as hard as he does and have the type of ego that Skip is claiming he has.  The truth is just that Westbrook isn't a high-IQ basketball player. He's not a cognitive, cerebral-type of basketball player. And that's evidenced by his game never improving since he's been in the league. It's not to say he's a bad player, but his game is more-or-less the same as it was when he entered the league. A great athlete with some skill but very low IQ when it comes to actually thinking about things when he plays. Sometimes it's just like that.
Calm down guys.its preseason
I'm trying to get my music behind 1 of them laker commercials or at least have the DJ slap it during a game.
They wanted that game bad and still lost.  How yall big 3 lose to golden state bench 🤔 laker fans salty them old men tired 😫🤣 here come people saying it's only preseason.  Then why did they put in all they starters against Jordan poole and Andrew Wiggins 🤔
Half a season. I think we will be the 4th seed
First of all it will take a little for them to understand how each other ways of playing. They'll be fine then all these critics will be silent. How long it took the Dream teams to gel they practiced first clearly and learned each other.
Mannnnnn! Russ Can’t win… ONE minute he’s a BALL HOG and the NEXT minute he gettin’ done for TURNOVERS!! Smh
Russ was used to iso-ball playing all his NBA career, obviously, he was asked to share the ball to other players. It will take a long time to get use to decide when to shoot and when to pass.
No favors Shannon lol... don't give him a favor Skip... 😆 🤣 😂
"Russ why?" :(
It’ll be hilarious if the Lakers just destroy the warriors first game of the season.
Allen Iverson, Steve Francis, Russel Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, and their ilk, play or have played the PG position but are not true PGs. Being a PG is a mindset, not just talent. You have to know how to manage your team, the game and yourself. They’re big offensive machines in a “small” package.
It would be great to see the video yall see
Lebron is the all-time leader in turnovers. Go figure.
I wish I could see the clips they react to lol :D
I wish they would show the clips they are looking at
Ik people still need keep they jobs need something to talk about even in preseason. So much judgement and such just for preseason. It’s like trying out new moves mew tricks before actually open shop.
Who can help me please?
Here is the thing ..Performance Enhancement Drugs have weakened professional athletes skeletal system so bad half of the healthy players who start this year will be to injured to finish the season.
My boy skip getting old
hhhhhhhhhhhhh
Rondo is the floor general after Lebron. The team play immediately improves as soon as Rondo hits the floor.
It's the preseason
why are people acting all surprised? I TOLD yall wes was a bad idea for the Lakers. AND with having unhealthy players on IR, AND older players? 82 games? BRO ion think Lakers are gonna have a good season. A lot of injuries, but ALSO a lot of highlights. Think Lob-City Clippers, but with a lot of turnovers and not a lotta dubs.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my honor and privilege to present to you the Los Angeles Geriatric Kids formerly known as the Los Angeles Lakers.  My knees, my elbows, and my ankles, they all hurt...  (oo ) (oo) ( oo)!! Where's my Geritol!!??!!
My Guy Skip doesnt undersand the slang "a minute" 🤣
He should of went to the Bucks
I didn't ever think lakers would have got russ...why? Lakers Lakers want the big name 4 ticket sales more get n the right name that fits the team. Do u want chips or sales
Shannon: Russ gotta take care of the football 🤨 Skip: He treats it like a football 🔥 Me: Ooohhhhh‼️😯😅😅
The lakers were winning damn near the whole game and we had people playing that aren’t even on the team
Team chemistry is off Westbrook still learning
Wen will people realize Lebron is a black hole for other stars
We do this again bruh, without injuries the lakers are making the western conference finals ain't no team apart from the warriors at full strength are beating the lakers 4times . its just that simple
Russ slow down let the game come to you
Currently #9 on trending...👀
Skip really hate bron
Russssssss
Been a lakers fan for life its just pre season its gonna be fine 🏀💪
How did the Warriors look?
Nba basketball ughhhhhhhh
Shay is a true fanboy
Russ just needs more time
Bold statement: Denver vs. Phoenix in the WCF
Skip should do horror movies 😂😂😂😂he got that look 💯💯💯💯
Lakers big 3 is cool... but how bout them warriors? Poole is about to be the MIP, they're getting klay back, wiseman will get another year under his belt, and now Curry actually has teammates to space the floor. Warriors are back.
Did anybody expect the oldest team in the league to play hard in preseason games?  They are out their practicing
Before allstar game, LE gm gonna trade them all heheheh
It would be better if we could see the footage (short part of the game) that Skip is referring to. You guys can see the clips and comment. I can’t. Please take that under consideration.
The Lakers killed their chances of a ring because they signed Westbrook instead of Kyle Lowry
Russel for Ben Simmons???!
The Tune Squad played better than LBJ Laker's.🤣
I hate to admit it, but...I think LeBron should be the point guard and Russell should do layups.
Relax people... Y'all all starting to sound like people who don't know anything about lebron.. Remember this man took the Cavs to the finals.. This Lakers team is stacked. There is no way a team is going to stop them from getting a chip this season..
Bucks in 6
Shannon tripping.  I kno for a fact when the season start Lakers going to cook like crazy.   They don't take pre-season serious.
Honestly I like this team. They will be killer watch. I've always said if there is one guy who can command Westbrooks respect it's lebron.
The Lakers are not even trying and they didn't have all of their best people in
Man that Skip is funny
Turnovers can always be cleaned up.  This is what you call "preseason basketball ". It'll get cleaned up.
Lakers are old and have no chemistry. Warriors have a ridiculous bench, James Wiseman, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Curry, and Wiggins. You do the math.  Not to mention a breakout star named Jordan Poole😂.
Russ will go down as the worst player to ever win an mvp with jocic as a close second.
They will again speak about the lakers all year???!!
Preseason calm down guys this is preseason basketball lol
Skip looks rough! LA is gonna be a dumpster 🔥
Embarrassing for Lakers..
I couldn't have Russ on my team.
I said this from jump. They would have did better signing me then Rus!
Skip Bayless is a genius.
I predict Westbrook gets traded mid season
Chinese are not going to be happy lebron
Lakers team is only for game highlights not in championship team
We talking about PRESEASON!?!?
Skip ain’t making it into the NBA Hall of Fame averaging 1.4 ppg
I mean you cant put old pieces in a machine and expect it to work like new…..
Good game
This man said no one gets less for Brooklyn...what was he smoking.
They are all just overpaid clowns 🤡
Westbrick
preseason man wait till the mid to late season for them to get serious theyre just loose out there
The King is not a king, just a village idiot that can seem to connect with those titles.
They should start rondo and have Westbrook come off the bench with the second unit .
They did not lose becausr of russ. They lost because the team doen not play like a team. They ate scatteted all over the place
Buddy was a better choice… especially with melo shooting 40%.. buddy would be around 40-45% spacing would be best in the league… A.D wins mvp… lebron would score whenever he wants…
Lebron has the most turn overs in NBA history check it out.
Skip reaching with this one 🤣 it’s preseason man. I could care less what any player is doing right now
The big 2 and the dress wearing Russel.. is the correct title..
I don’t even think that they have to play a bunch on the court with each other just let Russ cook the other team second unit when Bron and AD resting up
Big names don’t mean better player
One game!!!!! you guys need another topic this LeBron thing is getting old
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH
Russel washbrook
Trade westbrook.
Somebody help Skip with his drug addiction please!
The heavenly heavy hellish brandy natively clip because india opportunely bubble worth a bashful word. torpid, unkempt cinema
#4 trending. Everyone is tuning in to see how the Lakers new big 3 are doing.
What kind of Mickey Mouse operation shows skip staring at replays off screen? Show the dam highlights to the viewing audience too.
U always agree with everything lebron said Shannon get off ur knees  Man you might be pregnant
LA has ammo just for half a game.
Lol they played like 6 min all together on the floor give them a break
lakers full force with all start and homecourt vs gsw no allstar. lebron said practice is more important to him. then he play full force to use and apply whats their learn and improve in the practice but lose to gsw with out steph. lakers no chance in the playoffs this year. maybe next year. lakers is more strong last year unlike now
Lebron/Lakers be like, its pre-season, dont worry bout it...   I be like.... BS!!!
looooooooooooooool
Why when they show replays of games we can’t see ?
I loved the kobe era lakers I can't trust these FAKERS 😒
Big ego payers like Russ and Melo do not fit well for deep playoffs teams because they simply do not adjust.
Lebron was dowing ok but u can see him looking old. Melo looks better than lebron and he shoots better to me melo a killer give him the ball and let melo get a flow gone ever game becase hes a shooter get the shooters gone ever game if lebron ant gone do anything use melo and westbrook u got ad to
🟣🟡💜
Allen Iverson dribbled a football before
LeBron needs kyrie n wade.. they will be the laughing stock after this.. all stars senior team getting embarrassed.. losing streak continue
It’s just preseason guys
Well it’s a new team .. chemistry takes time this is expected
Russell has to come off the bench.
LOL 0-5
How does a guy from triple doubles 2 like 4 3 and 12 turnovers like jus stop lakers. Lakers walking to the chip
Imagine this Lakers team but everyone is in their prime. It’s just preseason fellas. We will figure it out and we’ll be fine. I’ve never even seen anyone care about preseason this much but it’s going to come together.
This team going to lose alot. Period. Listening to LeBron make new excuses after every game is just music to the ears. Egos not going to win ball games.
Lakers lost to baby Warriors... only OG man on that field for them was Iggy everyone else is either new new or up and coming youngster
Is a lot of teams out there way better than lakers
The Lakers are the only I've seen get ultra critiqued about preseason
When are they going to add the highlights? Is that too much to ask for?
Rinky-Dink out fit Fox Sports. No monitors in the desk or off camera in line of sight than looking off set down at a screen of plays. $$$$$?
When will lebum ever learn...
Sniff Bayless and his year around allergies! ❄ 👃
Shannon's a hypocrite. First he said it's gonna take 3months. Now he saying it's just the preseason..lmfao😂😂😂😷🤧
They really need to show what they are looking at during replays. Just saying.
How is no one talking about the fact that the warriors look nice the didn’t even have steph or draymond give them some respect
Yup.... These pre season games are soooooo important.... Whoever wins the most pre season games always wins the chip................ Actually wait..... NO THEY DON'T!!! 🙄🙄🙄
I dont know how anyone watches any of the other sports debate shows. Skip and Shannon are killing it together. I do enjoy speak for yourself and a good second option. I literally just sat through 20 min over a preseason game... bravo skip and Shannon.
As a Clipper fan I'm laughing all the way to the bank can't wait for the flakers rollercoaster to start Westbrook is a cancer everywhere he goes
Like I said preseasons games don’t count they don’t try but I hope they don’t play like that in the regular season games
Shannon: " I wish Westbrook would take better care of the football. I mean basketball."  Skip: "Well he treats it like a football."   🤦🏾‍♂️😂🤣
I keep saying this, it's not like the Lakers won't get better, they will but honestly the warriors are going to wrench hearts right outta chests.. They coming.. Warriors ain't back yet, but they coming
This chemistry they have is great
LeBUM JAMES the goat hahahahaha
It’s October can we give them a few days to play together
It's a bit cringy it's like watching an all-star game and the team doesn't know who should take a shot
I doubt this gets seen but they gotta put the ball in russ hands and trust that he's ready to win his first title lebron has to last AD is second russ will win us the title. Lebron is A goat but we need to win now, let the young boys run
Every fkn year …🤣🤣. Skip, retire man.
Just take better care of the football 😂 Skip: he treats it like a football lol
1 game?
Skip sounds like he got COVID 😂
Play Russ at the 2 Bron and Rondo run point duh
It sounds like Russ is taking out a page out of LeBron promotion playbook. When the Lakers were eliminated last season LeBron post game interview was about his movie space jam. If the Lakers would have won those games the narrative would have been how great the team is. Now it’s about Russ and his documentary. That would be a good thing for the Lakers fan, if not then that means that he is really a bad fit for that team.
King James <3
That looked like a Sam darnold pass🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trade Brook for Kyrie! C’mon KD, I know you’re reading these comments. Make the GM move. You guys need a PG and this could be your redeem team. You’ll find redemption from all the fans who called you a cupcake for folding on OKC. Now you got the band together, and ya’ll looking for revenge. Do it KD!
A lot of ppl saying rondo is better but Westbrook HAS to start he makes over 44mil a year vs rondos 2 mil. You cant give  a 44 mil player less minutes, it’s all in with Westbrook for the lakers.
we back in trending bois
Are they called the Big 3 or The Weak 3. 😂😂
Regular season we going 10 and 0
Can u imagine the following players in their PRIME..... Melo, LeBron, Westbrook, Dwight, Rondo!!!!! But instead they were a decade too late. I said it, it's all up to AD and sadly he's injury prone
That opening game against the Warriors on Tuesday just became way more interesting.
LeBron should play point and Russ should operate as a shooting guard
I said this wasn't going to work both need the ball
Gang Gang!
u know what!  we don't have to work! because government will send u free money!  all we need to do it's making economy going to worst! then government will send u more free money!
Omg we absolutely suck
Check out 3:32 .................,.............  sorry skip no 1.4 a game hall of famers
Оденьте субтитры
GS had nobody on the floor and still smack the lakers. Lebum is garbage
Shannon “ man I can tell it was going take a month maybe 2 months”   Skip “ make it next year do it all over again” 🤣🤣😅😅
See how Shannon calmly analyze the sport compare to Stephen A Smith who yells all the time. I like this show better than First Take after they axed Max!!!! Even Skip is like a broken record lol I rather listen to him than SAS!!! With that said … Wesrtbrook has low bball IQ!!! That’s all he belongs on a 3v3 street ball not in the NBA…. Lebflunk made a mistake getting him at all……
This is one of the few times I would agree with what Skip said about LeBron and the Lakers
Michael Jordan won 6 championships without an allstar point guard or Center.
It would be great if undisputed would show us the highlights they be looking at… They do this all the time!  They look silly looking down like that talking about “come on Russ… Russ that’s a bad pass come on Russ… Russ!”
Westbrook Sucks this year so far.. Coach of lakers sucks, and the team is SLOW..
Skip is showing turnovers in a preseason game🙄😒
Let's get off Russ ....& Talk about how The GSW.... Outplayed the Lakers with Reserves & rookies
Lakers are trash with all those stars 😂😂
FJB
Why did they get Westbrook when they have rondo a true point guard and lebron a point guard too what they needed was a shooter like Caldwell pope he was money from tree and a great fit for lebron why they didn’t re sign him is beyond me Westbrook and lebron is a horrible duo Westbrook needs a team where his the man and is surrounded by role players the way Philadelphia did with iverson teaming him with lebron is gonna be a disaster pelinka sucks as a gm
I would love to see somebody with deep pockets bet Shannon however much money that he can't stop saying "like I said." 😂
They will be fine.. They will figure it out! Nothing to worry aboutb
What a time to be alive bubble championship doesn't count but PRESEASON GAMES DOES COUNT  😭🤣
Should’ve gotten Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook. Never listen to me. Never!!! And fail
Lebron needs to push but age is coming on... Its why he needs help
Fun fact. LeBron will retire as the all time turnover leader in the regular season and the playoffs.
Shannon changed his mind few weeks ago he was saying that westbrook was the missing link.  Anyway nothing makes happier to see lebron lose again and again.
Overreacting, trust me lebron will step up in the playoffs being a leader but he can only do so much. Is on russ if he wants this to work out.
LaBum needs to retire
Lakers defense sucks
Looking good is not enough u have to win ganes
Skip. This is the preseason!! Comeone now!! You are happy? 😂😂
56 wins
GS Bench players defeated Los Angeles Elders.
Skip thinking he could make the HOF😂😂😂
#1 and #9 in the all time NBA turnover list but of course westbricks turnover will be the highlight of unklutch sports media propaganda machine!
How about start Rondo and have Russ leading the 2nd unit?
I'm not a Lakers fan but I think they will play the kinks out and make it to the finals.  :)
They should trade Russ for Kyrie lol 😂😂
So why r they not showing the highlights that he’s looking at
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, Jesus said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Didn't the Clippers beat the Lakers on opening night but ended up choking in the playoffs while LeBron went on to win his 4th title? I remember Stephen A. blasting LeBron like it was literally game 7 of the finals. The Lakers don't look good right now but it's best to get these growing pains out the way in the preseason instead of a 5 game losing streak that could haunt them later on in the standings.
LMAO. He called Russ "Number 0 Rings" HAHAH.  Say what you want about Skip, but he's the master of troll nicknames for NBA players.
The Warriors missed 90 percent of their 3s in the first half. They were wide open. That’s not going to happen with Dray and Curry on the floor.
Love these guys!!! Best duo of all time!!!😂😂🤣🤣 Shannon a different kinda funny..that fun uncle funny!!! 🤣🤣🤣😂🥳🥳
Russ : By far the worst player that will be in the Hall of Fame. Maybe even the worst player ever in the NBA.
I called it as soon as I saw the trade. Worst fitting team ever. I'd be surprised if they got past 1st round.
I know this is the preseason but Kobe would’ve been disgusted losing 5 in a row🤷‍♀️
Got damn Jenny.
The Sam Darnold disrespect.
why wont yall talk about jordan poole and the warriors
The lakers are like a 45 year old newly divorced mom, hanging out at the club, trying to relive her missed youth, but doesn't realize that she is 20 years past her prime... it is time to go home momma.😢😢😢
So much better than listening to Stephen A. yell all the time
Plan an simple man like really , lebron should already have in mind to play off ball ….
Yeah the criteria ain’t that low skip
Laker clown fans will keep saying "only preseason" because they are 0-4 what else would they say 😭 if they were winning they claim they are the best 'from the same said "preseason game"
Love watching the Lakers lose
Skip just waits for moments like these
So it begins... Laker's get off to a 3-0 start..can the Lakers go 82-0...get off to a 0-3 start, will the Lakers miss the playoffs?  🤣🤣🤣... Also to come..should they trade Westbrook, who else should they get, etc.... it's coming people
You still have AD and Lebron who have played for over 2 years and should be winning them the game as Russ figures his stuff out. Westbrook was horrible the first half of the season for the Wizards last year but then switched it around after All Star break.
Westbrook will struggle getting his stats. Too many good players. He will have to learn. How to fit on this team.

Stop passing and drive … play your game … the Lakers need to find a way to adjust to his game.  I love Russ.  Don’t play him …UNLEASE HIM … HE IS ACHILLES …
Hahaha you know what the problem is? The Lakers put together an all star team OVERNIGHT coz the window of opportunity for LeBron is closing. They want to hurry up things coz they know the end is near. Let’s see what happens to this hastily formed Laker circus team this year
The Warriors are going to surprise a lot of teams. Bjelica, Porter and Iggy are huge bench pieces. And add Poole to that once Klay gets back.   Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney  Poole/Iggy/Otto/Bjelica/Wiseman  JTA/Moody/Kuminga.   That’s a deeeeep team with good defense and bunch of spacing.
Clones
Rondo is by far the better point guard vs Westbrook!!! Westbrick should come off the bench!!!
Brooklyn has the most talent!!!
All this talk about the Lakers but no praise on the warriors beating the big 3.
Nobody talking about the Warriors. They're going to win the West.
One word. Rondo. I'm saying that and I'm not a Lakers fan. Rondo will solve the PG prob
Jenny in purple 😍😍😍
This is too much. Rus ain't that much of a bad fit. Not a Laker fan. But they will meld together and be a force.
Well uhh I’m sure it is Skip 😂
Russ going to give you a double double in bricks and turnovers too😂😂😂
Everyone knows Fanky V ain't coaching the Lakers it's been LeBrick James calling the shots since hes got to L.A.! Its so funny how some professionals have been playing for years in league and cant figure out how to play on a team?!?! Psshh man get outta here with that!! Plain and simple it's just not going to work no defensive players all slow shooters and drivers to the rim. That being all said bagging the Lakers, I'm a die hard Lakers fan and I havent like my team since LeCrybaby James has gotten to the team. That bubble chamship everyone knows its was the worst year for players, Lakers just a good enough team to win that year. BAMM!
Russ has the weakest basketball fundamentals in the NBA.
Russ is amazing..... But he doesn't make those around him better.
If a part of your big 3 is an aging westbrick... Good luck to you.
They really got Russ so no one else has him lol
Why can't viewers see the highlights? Makes it hard to follow otherwise good commentary
The Lakers look like a old folks home team.
I saw russ getting frustrated in the game with the turnovers. The thing is, if he puts his ego aside and just strive to blend with the rest of the group. He could actually do better, His cross court passes are way too predictable, it wouldn't hurt to learn new things than Driving to the basket then bail out pass outside. Even if he leads the 2nd squad it might still work.
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
tf its the 1st game playing together plus its preseason yall dumb if you think the lakers arent going to be good they just need to adapt give  or take
So the Sixers wax the Nets without Ben Simmons Okay Skip
Skip- "He treats it like a football" 🤣
Too many star ⭐️ players on one ☝️ team.
Skip said rich Paul told them to not record one of bron’s turnovers 🤣🤣
It’s a new NBA, Lebron needs to go.
“Practice. We’re talking about practice.”   AI
You know the Lakers are bad when Skip is trying to be nice 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
imagine skip making the hall of fame with 1.4 pts in high school 😂
But Thkiup...
Shannon will pump anybody up, except the best quarterback to ever play the game. He should stick to making excuses for people and tone the negativity down a bit, he's better at it.
.
“You go” offense won’t fly. Run the triangle offense. Lebron and Russ take turns as the Kobe role, AD in the pay gasol role, then shooters shoot. It’s not that complicated Vogel baby
Already scape goating.
Don't you just hate it whenever skip looks at a replay and we can't see what he's watching??? I wish they would show the replays... Who's in charge? Who thought it would be a good idea for skip to talk about and look at a highlight but we can't see it?
So we just not gonna talk about how great the warriors are looking
Lol 😂 can't even win agains warriors bench. Better start trading all does super stars and keep lebron and ad and get shooters thats all you need to try to compete
Skip with that “Russ Russ”  Absolutely cracked me up 😆
That looked like a Sam Darnold pass LMAOOO
Lmao i thought everything bron touches was gold😂🤣🤣
Y’all realize almost the entire squad done 10-15 preseasons at this point they do not care😂
Maybe they would play better in China...
LOL @ analyzing a pre-season game like this..   Lakers will have chemistry issues for maybe half the season.   If this works, it will likely take off after the AS Break..
How come this account "Skip and Shannon: Undisputed" does not show the play clips while the other account "Undisputed: Skip and Shannon" does?  Which is the official channel?
Answer is the point guard
Rondo needs to start and Westbrook needs to come in as the 6th Man.
Mr. Zero ring. Lol.
That's why KD vacated Westbrook,
Ayo I'm a warriors fan and if we beat the Lakers ima be happy but I don't want to hear skip bayless saying lechoke
Come on Russ, Russ , Russ 😂😂😂😂
Lakers will have a coach Byron Scott season.
"i put a positive spin, im gonna need you to return the favor" lmao
Calm down completely & hear God's voice...
You know lebron will take the back seat as far as ball handling , it won’t be Westbrook.
They not winning it this year its James harden nets u better believe it
Shannon wishful thinking. A month or two? Try It might take a whole season.
Lakers are in trouble with this lineup ! Lol ! 🤣 They are not winning the West ! Nope
The Fakers will win the arthritis championship of the elderly but not the NBA championship.
This guy's lose to Warriors 2nd and 3rd unit and Lakers played 30 minutes while the 2nd unit played 18 minutes exactly.
Warriors will dominate this season
They will not win the championship this year no way 💯
number 0 for 0 rings 😂
Rondo (point) Westbrook (shooting guard) Melo (small forward) Lebron (big forward) Davis (center)
Russ played well with James Harden in the second half of that season. They can pull together as LeBron is the maestro.
Carmelo has no business being a starter. All he should do is catch and shoot. He is not and never has been any kind of playmaker or passer.
Meanwhile Warrior stans act like they won the Larry O'B last night.
Black guy giving excuses eeaarrrllllyyyy. Shameful.
Someone please explain the fire drill analogy to me
Skip always remind me of sum1 that could be a great heel manager / gm in wwe 🤣😂😂
the heat playin to win lets go🔥
The Lakers are doing a huge mistake. Lebron should play point guard and Westbrook should play shooting guard. This little change will make them championship contenders.
This Westbrook experiment might be a disaster
Remember the big 4 didn’t play in the 4th
were not talking about how good golden state and jordan poole is
Wow...you think?
Egos
Once skip starts rocking left to right before launching on LeBron James 🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣💯💯  This show, Shannon, all gold.🦾🦿🏋‍♂️
Preseason and Laker fans are panicking
why big 3 when Melo is with them.. should be big 4, right?  it’s kinda disrespectful to Melo! 🤭
Danggg 500k views in 7 hours and #4 trending  👀👀👀
Vogel can become coach of the year if he admits now that the best way for this to work, is for Westbrook to play with the second team.     The Lakers have the depth to put two different teams out on the court. So let’s do it!!    Time to recognize that Russ and LeBron will play better if they’re each asked to run their own offenses, separate from each other!     Let’s have Russ lead the best 2nd unit in the history of the NBA!     That would prove that all these new Lakers are truly committed to doing whatever it takes to win an NBA title. AND it just might be the best way to make all of this talent work.     Just a thought…🤔
The real problem with the Lakers is Lebrun    A superstar should never have to switch teams to win
Does LA trade Russ for Ben Simmons???
just when Skip said “…Yuup you gonna have to deal with me right now..” at 2:18 is when I click the X and find different things to watch
This is one of them situations where everyone gunna say WE TOLD YOU SO …
LAKERS WANT TO PLAY FAST PACE WITH OLD DUDES IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK.
Basketball is not rocket science. You have to pick a direction and then go from there. You can't be all willy-nilly and winging it. LeBron James has to come out with the energy and leadership that he has been held and praised for for the last decade. He has to come and set the tone as the leader. Or it's all going to crumble. For the record I don't believe they're going to win a championship. But I do believe the talent shouldn't be less than 3rd in the west. Barring 2 major imjuries
Russ should come off the bench i think that he will help the team to push the pace with the second unit
Anybody that watches basketball knew this wasn’t gonna work why are people surprised 😂🤣
😂 team nets they look they whack😂🙋🏽😂🙋🏽😂🙋🏽😂🙋🏽😂😂🙋🏽😂🙋🏽😂🙋🏽
Rondo still the lakers best PG
Wow, Lakers didn't have Trevor Ariza...
y dont u talk about other teams y is it always about lebrons team spread the love
James is trash the whole team is trash
Skip is right, Russ shouldn't handle the ball
On the bright side of things. It's just preseason.
Shannon begging for mercy just as he was finishing lol. Too soon to call it but Skip haters can go eat dung.
Shannon a joke the excuses are amazing
Y’all weird, you can’t expect people to work right away they played one preseason game together
Kobe was more consistent than LeBron he learned from the best mj
🤣🤣🤣🤣 skip loves the Russ entertainment 🤣🤣🤣 it just tickles him to death to explain Russ logic lol
how many Taiwan soldier wanna fight for caiyingwen?
Every LeBron team always starts like this it always takes them time to get things going, but they still wont beat the warriors with Klay.
Big Veteran squad with Lebron and AD start the game....And then Westrbook as sort of a 6th man, comes in with the young squad and is told to lead the 2nd team...2 different attacks, one slow paced and one fast paced...making the Lakers dangerous AF. Have they tried that or are they acting like Westrbook and Lebrom HAAAVE to start together....dumb
Lakers: Losing 4 straight persons games  Nets :  Losing Kryie due to Covid 19 vaccine   It looks like the Los Angeles Lakers and the Nets did very awesome in the off-season they gonna might fail from these results
Russ for Simmons
Russ trying to force to many assist
SHOW SOME HIGHLIGHTS!!!!!!!
Was this the first game of the playoffs ? What’s the big deal ?
Next time Undisputed does a Q&A let’s ask when will they show the replays
How about Russ as 6th man? Great fire power he would be off the bench? Hm
They looked like they needed to give melo the ball...
Hey apologist...this the league destroyer infront of you
So is everybody gonna skip over the fact that Shannon called the coach Frankie V hahahaha
Thats your king? When did Jordam have this low time performance???
I think Shannon is right about the triple doubles. I expect AD to gobble up too many rebounds when he's healthy, and Dwight to gobble up a bunch otherwise.
Dame > Westbrook
Skip talked about this early in the season….I’m a laker fan and even I saw Westbrook and Lebron having issues
Skip in the HOF? 😂
11 Turnovers between Westbrook and Bron in less that 30 min each. I say when they signed Westbrook that the Lakers will avg 20 Turnovers per game with these 2 playing. Wait and see....
Preseason, doesn't matter. I'll panic when the lakers are 0-10
If AD stays healthy they've def got a shot idk tho Russ Bron and Melo at this point in there careers seems kinda meh ..I could be wrong I didn't think they were gonna win the bubble title and they did..not a Lakers fan but would love to see Melo get a ring
The Lebron/Lakers brand….This video has 4 times the views than anything else they posted test
Warriors not my team but I won $25 on Lakers pre-season loss with my faker I mean laker friend. 💪
If I wanted to see a post reaction video it wouldn’t be of skip . This show is out of touch af
I wouldn't be. Of course if this extends to >10 games in the regular season, but Bron is just getting used to a new team. The heat one year 9-8 (first year together) then won 12 in a row.
lakers stink
Those 3 Lakers guys combined is just a game ticket driven machine which is used to draw audience, nothing more than that! They have no chance to even going to the NBA final for 2021-22 season, as long as Warriors’ main guys Curry and Thomson are healthy, period! Give them 2 months to get ready? Not even 2 seasons, it will not happen, Westbrook is a loose canon which nobody can control.
Going to be hilarious having Skip review Russ turnovers all season lol
Does Skip snort something? Always has a cold? A sinus problem?
Did Shannon really say "russ the only piece that don't belong"? Excuse me, you do kno this is the preseason right? You starting to sound like skip
Lebron fans bahaha
The only problem tht we got is turnovers westbrook shot look good rn and we gel good when our starter on the floor
AD is eventually going to get annoyed with Russ padding his stats and stealing rebounds all the time. Now way he should be getting so many with how many big guys Lakers have.
Lmao this is hilarious, it’s literally preseason 😂
If Vogel doesn't start Rondo, he gets fired. Take the heat for Westbrook.
Trade Ben Simmons for Westbrook.
lol see watch who you listen too. Trevor went to westchester. He’s from the city and always been a laker fan.
It’s gotta hurt Shannon to look across the table and admit skip was right about Russ.  😂
Gotta show the clips you are talking about,I ain't gonna watch you watch videos sry....I love this show otherwise.....
there are no teams in the NBA, it's just a bunch of guys playing basketball, facts.  Name another league they play against, right.
LOOK!  Russ is doing what players are SUPPOSED TO DO during the  PRE-SEASON! He is attempting these passes to different teammates (tht he will probably end up playing with in the lineup during the season) as a way of testing their awareness, speed and their tendencies this is a very intelligent way of getting a feel for the different players on the team. THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF PRE-SEASON! YES Lakers hve not won a game YET in the pre-season HOWEVER, once they get all of their pieces in place & into play they ARE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY,  DIFFICULT to defend and s or against!!!
Lol this is hilarious  that they are getting this much attention cause of a few pre-season games, however it just shows how much attention and pressure will be on these 3 to make it work.
😂
All the star players are "selfish",they all want to be the reason the Lakers win,they all want to be the "I"in Team.😖
It just comes down to reps. They’ll be fine the more they play together
Lakers need to take a look at the Bulls and how they are not being selfish when it comes to the ball.  Their guys are more than happy to pass the ball to a teammate if it's going to lead to a score.  That's the mentality Lakers gotta have with so many guys that hog the ball.  Take pride in those assists.
😅😅😅
I just cant wait for the injuries to settle in on the lakers.
Russell Out Of Control Turnover Westbrick. 20 turnovers in 6 quarters. WOWWWWWW😂
For Skip not to like Russ he sure keep up with him… damn u know about his movie too
Doesn’t matter if it’s preseason, NO ONE is trying, yet the lakers still get made to look like dog turds. LeBron needs to quit talking back to people and get this mess of a team together.
Agreed skip....Basketball hall of fame is nothing like the NFL hall of fame...You average 15 and 7 you probably in the NBA hall of fame....You had to be GREAT....To get into the nfl hall of fame....
Skip old man mannerisms are getting funnier as he ages it’s just cool to see him have all his mental faculties together at his age really shows the power of taking care of yourself
Idk why ppl are Tripping this is the preseason
Warrrrrrrrriiiiiooooorrrrrrssssss!!!!!
My guy Shannon looking Sharp(e) no pun intended. Suit on point
Not winning no championship. 😂🤷🏼‍♂️
If Russ can play into a role , he’ll win ring this year. Not saying he can’t control pac and still go right at people’s necks on fast break he can, he just has to relax and take notes instead of give them now… it’s going to be confusing and weird at times.
ik its preseason, but you’re still playing proffesional basketball and the lakers look like doodoo
🤣🤣🤣
Buddy Hield should have been picked, he is way more dynamic and scores in ways that don't get in the way of lebron
8:58 "That looked like a Sam Darnold pass" 💀 💀💀💀 skip is too funny
Russ and Harden both need a ring.
Why don't they build a specifc line around Russ to beat the teams that will beat. Let him be the spear and put Rondo in there to feed him? The potential with all this power is they can figure it out it will be spectacular.
I am Warriors fan, but come on, it's pre-season. Talk about Kyrie instead
Westbrook is just out of tune/ shape mentally
Ben Simmons and John Wall to the Lakers. Championships championships and more championships. 🏆
By the looks of things, Lakers is not going anywhere. Im a Lakers Fan.
All you Lakers fans gone be hella mad warriors knocking them out for sure Lakers got no shooters couldn’t even play against are bench Lakers have no bench
Commented my comment at 2:30
Russ is used to being the antentokumpo on the team.. as more practices go on, he’ll learn to live with his team as a practice player, and grow as ppl used to before him when he was on OKC like Dennis and Reggie Jackson. Russ will figure it out.
The entire team is new. It's not like it's the same team plus Russ. The entire team needs to get chemistry. Of course it's gonna take some time
Jajajajaja ni siquiera curry participó 🤣💨🔥
Hahah! A fire drill. That is going to be the Lakers the ENTIRE season. Whoever thought this Laker team stacked with boomers is going to win anything is delusional. They are past their prime, Lebron is done, he aint the GOAT, get over it Lebron / Laker fans.
LeBron is not better than Steph in passing.
The Lakers shot" them self  in the FOOT,..🏀 Westbrook, belongs with the Wizards,..
bron the bowling ball crashes threw the defenders               no call
They were beaten the warriors but the starters sat down and let the young players play they need a opportunity too The starters could have finish them off if they wanted to
Jenny looked surprisingly delicious announcing that football game I was shook when it said Jenny’s name and she was talking 😍😍
Shannon with the obvious hype up this isn't even a storyline it's preseason
I like how people said the lakers is OP ASF signing everybody in the league now people saying they not even going to make the playoffs is laughable 😂
jenny tries getting us all bricked up the only 4 seconds she’s on i swear
Takes time to learn each other's game.
Looked like a Sam darnold pass
we miss the lakers of Karim abduljabar and magic or Kobe and oneil! this lebron and superstars has no charm or dedication! + they traded Caruso what a bad move, they traded the guy who made them win the trophy last time(Rando helped as well)????
How about talk about the Warriors?
They got beat by the Warriors bench.
I think rondo needs to start at point.. Then bring in russ and melo to spear head second team..
Talk about something else
The Lakers season will end in April. These guys have played too many seasons.
Lakers going to trade russ for Ben simmons
Warriors win the game and no congrats, no talk about how they did, its always about lebron lebron  all when they lost everytime, so what about the warriors win, u aint going congratulate them
I said from the jump I didn’t like the Russ move. It’s hard to win with a pg who can’t hit 3s consistently now adays. Kyle lowery would of been a better fit
If Wade can fit with Bron than Russ can too. Stop being stubborn Russ, switch it up
The problem is this isn’t 2015!!!! Lmao
Lol, 🤣 everyting lebron can do, when he has no confident, cant win without allstar teams, so how if enybody its lebron, always acting as if lebron is god, even when lebron is washup its still lebron, 🤣😅
Didnt even mention the warriors???😂🤣
Do you let Russ facilitate to bron and AD and bron and AD focus on scoring or do you let Lebron facilitate to Russ and AD ?
Where the heck she come from
Russ is a prime example of Can't Get Right.. Russ belongs in a special Ed
I can smell trade later
It may take them two to three years to blend….
are these guys aware that we cannot see the highlights (plays) that they are looking at?
Dont believe the talk believe the results
Warriors bench plates out played Lakers big 4 I know it’s pre season.Lakers wanted to win they bench is trash
As a Warriors fan I was happy with the way they played, but it's preseason so calm down everyone.
In all honesty, we should have gone with Dame! Russ' game depends on handling the ball and calling the plays...
Skip “Water Pistol Pete” Bayless in Basketball HOF 😂🤣
You talking about practice..  practice. Man
The problem is lebron gotta reinvent his self play off the ball at the right time get the ball let Russ gain patience 4 even more greatness ..greatness takes understanding listening teamwork talking and belief .. That’s the only way Honestly they can’t win the ring. with lebron pushin it  all the time it’s takin away from who Russ really is ..
Undisputed would be so much better if we could actually see the plays skip n Shannon watch back
It’s the pre season like relaxxxxxx
Honestly Westbrook And Lebron Deserve each other !! These next 3 years are going to be some of the best basketball we’ve ever seen
Honestly Westbrook And Lebron Deserve each other !! These next 3 years are going to be some of the best basketball we’ve ever seen
Skip payed more attention to a Lakers preseason game than a Dodgers playoff game
Wilson is an elite athlete, not an elite basketball player. He relied on too much stat padding and is a terrible teammate in the floor. Too much history proves my point. Hes a TO factory as well.
While im not a big fan of the Lakers or Lebron, if one thing I always never forget is everything Lebron gets new teammates. And takes awhile before they find a grove to match there skills on the floor. The question is who will be the primary scorer ?
Bron play's chess all he's doin is putting the pieces together let's just hope russ falls in line
Westbrook sloopy play is going to cost them games. He'll end up blaming other guys on the team but it's him.
As a warriors fan I'm happy to see how our team is playing. But I'm not taking nothing from this game. It was the first of the Lakers big 3 together. I feel they will be better with chemistry but these are the 2 teams in the WCF an warriors in 6
If they don’t win it all. Russ better watch out. It will be his fault
Russ thinking about women's winter fashion.
keep dat same energy skiiiip
The Lakers are gon implode
the preseason is useless, Lebron led teams have always started slow. As long as AD and Lebron are healthy before the postseason seeding does not matter
Skipp is loving this...
LeBron said something similar about I.T
As Shannon would say… what a fraudulent team
Skip is hilarious asf saying Rich Paul went to scoring table to take Lebron's turnover away that's pure comedy Lol!!
Skip you really just tried to sneak in that you could make tha hof you scored 1.4 points in high school
Why do they show skips face instead of the play😂
This is why I don’t watch the NBA it’s like Lebron your suppose to be the Goat why can’t he win a championship with good players why does he need superstars to compete. You look at Curry he had no team that man carried them to wins almost making to the playoffs. I have no respect for Lebron I hope he loses and yes I’m a Lebron hater he’s not the goat.
Crazy all the people that was saying skip was dumb n this that n the third go missing once the things he says will happen , happens 😂
Watch Skip fire Shannon just like Maxwell got fire for always arguing with your boss haha
Where you guys see failure I see posibilities. The season just started. Once they get it together they will win the ring.
What do people expect when Lakers construct the team from senior day care center? 🤣
Lakers won’t make the playoffs this year. And, they’ll remain healthy.
What kind of production doesn't include the damn highlight they are talking about
7th seed Lakers
Mid season the Lakers and Nets exchange Westbrook for Kyrie lol
And way too early to be downplaying the Lakers or anybody else. It’s all just About to start and I am 1000% sure we are going to be having a different discussion later in the season
😂 I love skip
Drip Bayless!!! Take em to school Skiiuupp!!!
This chemistry they have is great
Nemine trip dubs, Russ after them quad dubs
All these over dramatic reactions. ITS PRESEASON. PRE... P-R-E
The pieces they added to the team don't complement each other, they overlap. If they don't figure it out they should just play as 2 teams, alternating between lbj and russ as the pg
GET EM SKIP!! YOU DONE TOLD EM!! THEY DIDNT WANNA LISTEN!! LET EM HAVE IT!! Bron the PG!! Westbrick at the 2!! They didn't wanna listen. Callt u a hater!! BULLJIVE!!!
Man skip is hilarious i meet him and his actually nice guy
Rondo Bron AD WBrook Melo Howard
I get exicted all the trash skip gives lafron 😂😂😂 ur team anit workin dj wtf u doin on that team ur mins anit nothing 2 it
"He tries things that you shouldn't try in those situations"? 🤔 You mean he displays bad decision making? Who knew? 🤷🤷🤫
The Washed boys will be the Welfare Boys after this season lol Westbrick has always been toxic thus EVERYONE has left his side. Only LeFlop James would be dumb enough to try to put such polar opposites together and expect a positive experience
Melo will be the unsung hero for the lakers
Shannon just be honest fam and admit if Russ is running the show you're looking at 6th or 7th seed at best and a 1st round exit!!!
Damn Lakers with all these injuries all ready...
Omg plot twist Lakers trade for Kyrie
Talented but Lacking Fundamentals   Go back to basic training; everyday in practice for this team. Because their talented enough but they’re bad habits have been coddled and tolerated for so long —you have to make them more disciplined in my opinion
Russ Russ russ lmaoo
Russell traded  to the Brooklyn as**** Irving leaving as we speak cause of covid
I like Westbrook but personally he wouldn’t be the ball handler for this team he’s a turnover machine and that won’t ever change far as I’m concern
Russell just gotta be the point guard and smarting up play smoother
What is preaseason??? Lol someone messed up spelling the topic
Can anyone tell me why lebron number has changed to 6?
The Lakers can not guard these young players this will be interesting all teams
They both wrong Lebron and the lakers is going to beat the other teams. Warriors full of shooters and real players. Other teams is going to get washed by lakers
It's the Coaches fault. Blame Coach Vogel.
Trade Westbrook for Kyrie Irving
Skip That Shirt Killing!!
Open night when the lakers win watch the excuses
The funniest thing on earth is when the lakers win the championship they geting judge of damn preseason games lol
What are you talking about Skip?? LeCon was averaging 5, 6 turnovers a game last season🤦🏾‍♂️😂🤣
Lebron gonna coast during the season, .....until the playoffs
They need to get used to everything and it might take 2 years man 😒
... main problem, none of those guys can shoot - its gonna be a long year for  the other team in la...🤣
I thought LeCon made “everyone better?” 😂🤣
Westbrook will destroy this team
The Laker got to many old legs in the court. And their main player AD is slow. Play s they guy with the liveliest legs is Russ but he doesn’t always make the best decisions.   Plus lento is just getting old. Lol 🤦🏾‍♂️ I wish he would work on his shot like how Vince Carter did in his later career.
Why cant we talk about the warriors win and how good they played not just why the lakers lost....
Just start Rondo...
Should've got DeRozan, they made it too complicated. Melo with DeRozan then you have reliable shooters.
All Russ needs to do is run high pick n roll with the bigs and LBJ. Play defense and worry more about getting teammates involved and less scoring. He also needs to play a little off ball this season.
FAN BOYZ/BRONSEXUALS & D’RIDERS be like: “It was nothing” “It’s just the pre-season”
Man these lakers are going to win it all they know what they doing
It’s too early to be feeling like this let the season start first ppl forget it’s yr 19 for lebron y’all are expecting to much from him
Isn’t it just pre season? For crying out loud.
Lakers gone have to figure it out and it’ll end up coming down to letting them run the offense through Bron
Russ is a perfect fit for the second unit. Let rondo start and let russ run the bench unit.
Lebron would trade Westbrook for kyrie
The Lakers are OLD and SLOW ..... Its over for them ....
Don’t NOBODY listen to me. I been said it’s not going to work. IK BASKETBALL FR!!!!
Russ might fit in the nuggets
LeCon needed a scapegoat & Russ Westbrook is it🧏🏾‍♂️😂
I just hope Russ gets the credit he deserves for being overrated
What?????
They loss????????
Russ need to come of the bench and run the second unit.
Russ & Lebron are literally water & oil. It's not going to work lol
Lakers defense gotta get better more energy up the court ..end of discussion ..they will be ok
The lakers are finding out that sometimes more doesn't mean better
SHANNON SHARPE
Everyone is always making fun of Skip...I think its time to start making fun of Shannon 😂😂😂
FOX must be paying GOOD money for them to talk about a pointless game for almost TWENTY MINUTES!!!!! SMH
So how long before Westbrook is traded?
Russ can can’t play off ball.. and he’s too erratic to be the main ball handler.. he needs to be the 3rd option
Bucks or nets champs
Lakers are good enough to make the playoffs but the problem is lack of shooting and lebron doing all the work again. Lebron is getting old he can't keep carrying the load
Shannon full of LeExcuses
Guys just never understand that these dudes only turn it up when they want.Its about the playoffs and championship to these guys.
I don’t think the Lakers make the playoffs this year and if they do they’re not making it past the second round.
Trade Westbrook for Kyrie😂
Hey just to let y'all know My Bulls looking so in tune with each other!!
He tries things that you shouldn't try on those situations. Have y'all ever watched Russ play?!
It’s too much I in team with the Lakers when they’re capable of playing as a team.
Why is Skip bayless paid to talk about basktball?
They passed on Demar and Buddy Hield to sign Russ? Damn! what a disaster. Lebron should not have as much influence as he does on who his team(s) sign(s). They needed to rein him in on this. Lebron is his own worst enemy.
They better win it all,or it's a buss and the talk of GOAT ends. You have to be productive and win it all. They can not play this way during regular season. They let GS handle them without their front tier players on the court.
What happened to “ the calm before the storm “?🤣
Lakers playing this bad in the preseason. I can only imagine the reg season. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Imagine starting Sam Darnold in week 5...
If they all where vaxed they would have won😂😂😂
Can we talk about how good the warriors look 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’m tired of watching this and every segment is about Lebron
Labrick is done should just try and save himself to play with his kid he will never get six rings not nba anyway maybe if he goes to jewelry store  lmao 😆
Not in sync with each other and  more impotrantly, Lakers have zero Defense!
Skip has no chill calling Russ  "Mr 0 Ring" 🤣
Preseason doesn't matter
I’ll b surprised if lakers win 45 games
Lol pre-season games… nba season don’t start until Christmas remember 🤣 😂
At 16:16 "...if he can navigate arourd *draws a zero in the air* number Zero Rings."  Skip pulled up and dumped on Russ with that one!😆😆💀
This Lakers Squad has 2 Years to make it work... Then Again ... No They Don't.. 🤣😂
Lakers needed Bradley Beal
Lakers is like Space Jam 2!!!    Its a TRASH!!!!
Lakers @$$
Bron always had a issue with turning the ball over...Dont blame Russ lmao The hate for dawg is real smh
I can see the narrative they already blaming Russ for LeGM losing in the playoff or finals
Fresh legs v.s old legs. Poole will be gsw franchise after curry, klay
The only thing that would make this better was if we could see the replays they are watching! But these guys are the best on tv!
Put Lebron at the point  Russ at the 2
Warriors look good this season! Jordan Poole is a future All-Star 💯
LAL will finish 3rd in the east..I'll come back to this post next year..
LeBron and AD will run the show and Russell will play garbage time. Problem solved.
The Lakers will be a force to be reckoned with before the all star weekend
It’s not going to work man the Lakers got beat by the warriors bench 😂😂
The Lakers haver rarely run plays in years. They just had Bron and AD to make up for it.  Honestly Westbrook will make this craziness work cause they don't run plays. Russ is right at home in silly ish.  Golden state runs a motion offense with constant movement Lakers been standing around since Phil Jackson left.
This is why fighters say you cant learn a skill overnight. A lot of what athletes do are reactions and reflexes.  Westbrooks passing isn't going to change from preseason to regular season. He's been passing like this for over a decade.
Nets & Lakers finals ain't happening, with Russ & Kyrie. Better enjoy Christmas matchup
bru if molly was more like this lady i could watch first take
Doubtful Lakers will be healthy for the playoffs..too elderly..Dubs will beat em in the 2nd rd
Skip said Lebron caught Russ fever. This shows you he knows nothing about Bball! Lebron is the NBA All~time Leader in Turnovers, So Russ has LBJ fever!
Harden and No Covid shot man needed the ball to play and adjusted. Stop pretending like they are off the Ball players
How hard is it to plug in the highlights while they talk about it? Cmon man!
When Russ has a great game everyone will be on his 🥜! The media is so emotional 😭
They were all saying this about Brady last season and look what happened. I’m a hawks fan so either way I’m good
If Russel has one more bad game the title is gonna be "Skip Calls Westbrook A bigger Dennis Schroder"
Lakers should start Rando instead of Russ
Lol it’s 1 game
In this comment thread I think for the first time I'll be using the dislikes today
By trying to fit to the system unfortunately Russ is not the Russ I like a lot. How can we find the balance ? That is the 1million $ Lakers question.
They lost to the Dubs without Steph, Klay, or Draymond 🤣🤦‍♂️
Looked like a CCP fire drill.
“Russ. RUSS.”   skip and shay both said: 🤦‍♂️
Give me a break.  It's preseason.  I watched the start of the game they looked good.  This team is going to be monstrous.  In the regular season Russ, Melo and Howard are going to be on the floor when AD and Lebron are on the bench.  These guys are going to be so rested by the end of the season its going to be ridiculous.
Trade for dame
If it’s still bad by January they should trade Westbrook for Simmons
Rus and bron played for so many teams they forgot what team they on
The Lakers gonna use Westbrook when Lebron "time managements" so the Lakers can win in the regular season and leave Lebron for the post season.
Too many past, present amd wanna be alpha in the Lakers. No pecking order or true leader on that team. Have you ever seen multiple male lions roaming around as a pack??
Shannon is always wrong.  somebody needs to put together an hour long montage of Shannon's takes where they're all wrong, and that would be cutting the highlights short a few hours.  Remember when he was hyping the big penguin in LA?  Shannon would be broke if he bet on his takes.
they will come together n time they always think things supposed to happen right away 🤷
Russ & Lebron looked really good. If really good is competing for most turnovers.
they literally said the same thing about RW last year... shut up
Let us see what yall talking about
Its early Skip, they'll figure it out.  Its PRESEASON bro.
Лохи которые даже не пытались навязать борьбу в конце игры. Лейкерс отстой моё субъективное мнение.
Amen
Give the lakers a little bit of time then they'll be fine!
To the people that’s not worried about the WARRIORS, you should be afraid. Come back to this post in April 🥶🤫
😂😂😂😂😂 SHANNON SHARPE POINTING 👉 👈 👇 ERS ALREADY BLAME EVERYONE ELSE 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🥱🥱
It looks like a fire drill suddenly….hmmm…what changed that made it that way?  😂
Naw People just gotta respect Steph and his Team GSW have an Archery program over there. EVERYBODY SHOOTS 🏹🏹🏹
All these injuries already....smh
Any team with Carmelo Anthony & Russell Westbrook is destined to lose. Early playoff exit no further than the 2nd round they go🤣
5 straight loss...so poor team
Russ wore a dress, trust me, he's in.
This is preseason. You people are idiots to comment about a team during preseason. There are different rotations and experimenting with combinations. Turnovers will be key. That needs to be cut down obviously and they need more steals.
Is that your king?
If they don't get Austin Reaves on the floor ahead of Ellington. Im gon lose my 💩
The age of a lot players is the problem why can’t people see that. The players know this and because of that it becomes a mental issue they didn’t want to get hurt so they won’t go all out. They over think or hesitate.
I  can't believe it Shannon told it like it was skip was on to something LeBron has his work cut out  trade dead line can't come fast enough  lol
Only casuals or deluded Lakers fans would think this team has most talent. Core players are way too old and past their prime + they have no shooting. Even if they make it healthy to playoffs grandpas cant play D.
Thank you Bron for solidifying MJ's legacy. 👌
Rondo is the floor general after Lebron. The team play immediately improves as soon as Rondo hits the floor.
Let's talk about the warriors tho no curry draymond and klay and still beat the lakers
Shay owes Skip 342 cases of Dew
Brah said that’s grad schoolish 😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Russ need to hit up dwade honestly
We’ll get better when the regular season starts trust and believe
Lebum always been a turnover machine, thats why I've never seen him as a great point guard or floor-runner because he usually has almost as many if not more turnovers as he does assists. He's been 2nd in the league in turnovers twice, 3rd once, 4th 4 times & 5th 3 more times. He's had 11 in a game which is tied for 4th most all time. He has the most career turnovers by far of anyone else with 4,592. He also has the most in the playoffs with 975 & the most in the finals with 217. He's tied with Magic with the most in finals series with 31. He's just below Magic with the most in a finals game with 8 but he also had 8 in another finals game, 7 in 3 other finals games, & 6 in 8 other finals games. He has the most for a playoff season at 94. He's just behind Harden & Luka with the most in a playoff game with 10 but he's did that in 2 playoff games, 9 in another 2 & he's had 8 in 10, TEN PLAYOFF GAMES. He's lead the league 5 times with the most turnovers in the playoffs, been 2nd 4 times & 4th 3 times.
its preseason cut it out
Why didn't they say this about Brooklyn???
How is this channel still uploading at 720p in 2021, c'mon son
So haters say the bubble didn’t count but now these preseason games count 🤣 keep that same energy please
I don’t care what anyone says Skip is a Basketball hall of famer, he averaged more points in high school than LeBron did in college. That’s first ballot status IMO
this big 3 would work if LBL is 5-10 years younger.. but he is not.
You can’t expect things to work this fast. This was the FIRST game they played together. Pump the breaks.
“That looked like a Sam Darnold pass” LOOOOL
I smell a coach is getting fired
sniffles in the intro tho
Put Russ as the 6 th man. Lakers need a strong bench and Russell can just take over. We can have a 30ppg 6th man. Dominant
If Russell step down a little the Lakers have a chance. He need to play smart like Rondo.
Ummm. Lal where up entire game by almost double digits, until 8 mins left in 4th when lbj, russ and ad dddnt play anymore lmao. Its PRESEASON.
The Lakers nation are in for a disastrous shock this year. Facts trump opinion. This is why: 1. LBJ  will be leaning on his past glory and achievements  2. RW is done, over hyped, he is not the same anymore  3. AD is a bebelac, before we know it, he will be missing games due to injury  4. Mello will be so so, hit or miss 5. DH, RJ,........so so This team is going no where.
Skiuuuppp having a field day this week !!! Come on unk
Will LeGM be back at it before the All-Star Game?
Skip killed it today I agree with most everything he said
Lakers will turn it around.
sometimes i feel old when i tell people i was in the backyard pretending to be shaq eddie jones and nick van excel!! being a 90's kid but kobe was a bench player for first 2 seasons!! i was pretending to be jordan, pippen, kukoach, kerr, that 99 and 2000 knicks team mark price, john starks and many others even shaq and penny!! most of the years before i hit puberity which was when i was 10!! the lakers and celtics were not that good!! plus like most late 80's early 90's babies true 90's kids and pre teens it was mostly jordan and bulls anyway!!
Bro it’s pre season
Trash lakers like always, Westbrook gonna get traded
Lebron was playing fast pace early But he can't keep that pace up
Skip might have a point with this westbrook take, i hope not but i see the logic in it
Skip is Naturally funny im a Lakerfan been one since00 and this is the craziest roster ive ever seen but it will work mark my words they will hold a trophy either this year or next year idc i just need 1 more before the celtics Lol
Just only a few games.let see after a month
Westbrook of the bench and problem fixed let him be the dominant guy on the second unit where he can use Dwight or deandre like he did with Steven Adam’s or better yet trade for Steven Adam’s so Russ can have a go to guy he can trust
I swear in other years no one cared this much about preseason now all of a sudden it’s the end of the world if you lose hey everyone idk if u know this or not but THE GAMES DO NOT COUNT
Lebron’s seamstress job is gonna take a lil bit longer I guess lol
Lakers don't work unless Westbrook is the 1. They need to move Bron to the 2. That's it. With weapons on every flank, the best passer on the floor is Russ.
Man who cares about preseason lol
Relax the game dont count
Lol when the lakers win y’all will have so many excuses
The only team getting segments on pre season games 😂
Is the Lakers situation not similar to Miami big 3?
It's all an act lakers going undefeated
If u gonna try something.. Preseason is when u try it.
BRUH...IT'S THA PRESEASON! Don't trip, we'll be there at the end! 🏆x18
Russ come on Russ, Russ, Russ 😂🤣
Cmon guys its pre season they didnt play full minutes the rotations were random. This team is built for LeBron period it wont work without him on the court. We'll be just fine
If I didn't like Unc so much I couldn't watch Skip's rehashing of his haterism or gushing to the OVER extreme.  Why you think Unc got so many gifs out there😆🤦🏾‍♂️
“That looked like a Sam Darnold pass” -Skip Bayless 🤣🤣🤣
The lakers looked good when they were trying lol y’all just like to talk that’s all the world is now .
Useless big 3
The only way for this to work is trade for kyrie
Westbrick has to go man
Skip and Shannon undisputed. In my opinion they should have Randell played a point and push Ross at the shooting guard. That way you have somebody to control the temple when LeBron is not. And then Ross can attack wow if he wants to from that position.
But is the ball is Westbrook's best friend 🥺
I told everyone Russ is an athlete not a ballar there's a difference. He can run fast but has no breaks witch is why he turns the ball over so much.  He shot has not motions its like he's lifting weights when he shots the ball. There isn't enough shots to go around with him Melo AD and LeBron.
no skip didn’t say he could make it in the Basketball Hall of fame 🤣🤣
Lakers champion's hahaha please they don't even going to be 5 th place for West bulls are better
Can somebody please tell me why we can’t see what they see when they’re watching a replay 🤷🏿‍♂️🤔 I’m so confused to why they are so old school and I dig it their banter but why don’t they show the replays they’re watching🤷🏿‍♂️
Too many egos on one team say what you want it's not gonna work real spill 💯
It’s hard to tell from a pre-season game. But IMO I don’t think the Lakers will start clicking til mid-season. With LeBron there and a healthier AD, this is still a playoff team. But as far as Melo and Russ, they need to adjust to LeBron, they can’t rely on their individual talents anymore. They have to play system basketball if they want a ship.
As long as RW doesn't get the ball in the clutch, cut down on TO's.. everything will work out.
lebron has highest bball iq??? who started this dumb narrative? stop it!!!
Melo looks great bro 🤷🏽‍♂️ he’s hooping!
Rondo, Bron, AD and Dwight has won a Championship together. We can alway sit Westbrook.
The Lakers will be just fine.
🤣😂😂
Vogel needs to have better plays where they run a high low action with AD. He would get a lot of easy looks at the rim. Next they need to run some  plays  were  they set some back pick plays to Melo to get open three. Lakers just need better spacing for Russ and Bron to drive it to basketball.
Side bar: Yo Shannon's fade is freeeeeeeeeessshh!
Lakers players are paid millions of dollars a year, they don't care if they lose a preseason game
If the Lakers click…THEY CAN BREAK THE 33 WIN STREAK…which will lead to another Chip.
Lebron is not the best passer in basketball skip. LaMelo is
in all my years of watching basketball, I've never seen a more talked about preseason ! They literally spent 20 mins analyzing a team with championship aspiration during a preseason game smh.
Skip skip
There’s way too much young talent in the NBA today, these young guys aren’t going to slow down and wait for the veterans to figure things out, even if they did they’re to slow, yes! Even Westbrook!
Lakers now still on the process of building chemisty still im a lakers fun no matter what happen
number 0 rings 🤣🤣🤣
Those vaccinations messing them up lol
lakers are not a championship team right now, it’s all a media frenzy. they’re top 5 teams right now maybe. not top 2. trade deadline better be violent this year.
Preseason lmaooooo.
I hope russ finds a rhythm
I hate that we can't see the highlights that they're looking and talking about...
Lakers gonna be a 5 or 6 seed. Not much will change all season unless Russ or Carmelo is traded mid season. I’m a Lebron fan, I saw all I needed to see. No wins in the preseason. That’s a bad sign for Laker Nation
Does skip do coke ???
These high draft picks always injured. They need to take better care of themselves. Greg oden, James wiseman, Blake griffin , etc
Shannon is so nervous that Westbrook is gonna ruin this title run for Lebron. 😂😂😂
Lebron is like hiring friends for 5x5 pickup games. He is the manager,coach and captain. He did it at Cavs and now in Lakers. He didnt get his ways with Pat Riley at Miami thats why they played like a team and won rings.
They always forget about melo smh 🤦‍♂️
Skip needs to stop repeating the exact same things.
PRE-season. Nobody wins a ring during PRE-season.
Their problem is not TOs. Their problem is old fashion basketball, that was good for the 90's
Can you please show the highlights so we know what Skip is talking about?
What do expect from them it’s pre season
When skip watching highlights, it's a good idea to show us what he's looking at
the disrespect media ppl are showing the warriors😔
if I'm watching these morons I have to dislike the video it's my rule when it comes to killing braincells
They got rid of there young players and got super old players there going to miss kuzma kuzma would play defense on his guy and LeBron guy cause LeBron don't play defense good luck this year with no kuzma!!!!
Number zero rings 😂😂😂😂
Gotta admit, as a Laker fan, this ish look bad
It's only the preseason they just in the motion
All i could imagine when skip was questioning russ was swaggy p’s meme face.
the lakers is trash...they got smoked by tha warriors bench!!😂😂😂😂😂
My opinion. We need to RUN a dam offense. To many tough shots they need to stay away from takin turns isoing. Nobody is getting each other easy shots that has to change just kuz they can all get their own bucket dont mean they should 247. Melo was gtn wide open shots in portland lets get him back to that.. get russ some easy layups and dunks. Fkn help russ get acclimated insteada watchin him figure it out alone this a Team
Westbrook should consider playing off the bench max minutes playing both point and the shooting guard whenever he's on the floor with Bron. He'd easily win the 6th man title at the end of the season.
It's pre season. Fire shannon he's so annoying and skip!
Russ should be primary ball handler in my opinion, that’s what he’s best at, LeBron can do whatever cuz he’s good at everything, plus it will take a load off Bron
How about have russ run the second unit? I mean for the sake of winning.
Rich paul: eh em, maybe we should call that 1 a blocked shot
Before I watch, it preseason
unpopular opinion- russ should come off the bench
If the Lakers win every pre season game the narrative would be "its just the pre season" 🤣. Calm down folks its literally just the pre season....
It's only preseason wow smh yall tweaking tweaking
Lakers will smoke the warriors opening night  mark my words
The fact that they have a screen behind the two of them, but never show highlights on it when they pull'em up to prove a point, is super annoying.  Always bothered me on this show.
Can yal please fix it to where we can see the highlights. I feel so left out☹️
So what he saying is skip was completely right? Skip called this a long time ago, and Shannon does not seem confident.  I said it since the beginning the reason he cannot win playoff games is he causes massive amount of turnovers. Turnovers don’t mean as much in a game where people scored two points. Turnovers get out of hand when guys steal them and could still shoot the three.  Every extra possession is a 40% chance of three points…. And that turnover cost you a potential three point. So a turnover used to be a four point swing now it’s a six point swing.
This is gonna be hilarious, lakers not gonna make the playoffs.
OMG the Lakers look disorganized, it's PRESEASON people chill out 😏
When the first string Lakers can't beat the Warriors bench.
LeBron is not the highest I.Q. in basketball.. Please wish these guys stop over hyping that dude's games and on court vision. Chris Paul I.Q is Better and , Stephen Curry, and  Rondo... Are better and I can name more but I'll stop there with it.
LEXCUSE has begun 😂😂😂😂😂 i wonder who will leBUm trade first and who will he blame first 😂😂😂😂😂
Russ for Kyrie??
Is it me or does Skip look 10yrs older then last yr 🤔
Wakeup, the Lakers problem and the rest of the NBA this season is The New and Improved Warriors. Forget about triple doubles they don't win games and besides, Westbrick had almost triple double turnovers in the last 3 games LOL!
Sleeping on the Warriors Klay back they go be in the mix!
I’m team BRON & I understand what Shannon means about what can’t be happening w/ Russ on a championship contender team but Shannon can’t be making Russ turnovers more or less important than others…. Bc Russ probably gave away more possessions but if they scored more off Bron turnovers then it’s not “JUST 6 turnovers” I don’t like how Bron can’t do no wrong in Shannon eyes…. But Bron is Goated lol
The real story is Warriors are gonna be crazy this year
Russ playing like Ross.
Bruh y'all are crazy... Just wait 😆 Russ will fit with Bron and they will take over
The minutes of Lebron and Russ need to be stacked. Westbrook would be the most expensive bench player ever
Pin this ima make it one more time before then season start Jordan Poole will be most improved player this year an putting up 18-22 points just watch I said it will happen last year now everybody see flashes of it now lol mess me with it let’s go dubs 😁😁😁😁😁 championship this year just watch
Did we watch the same game? They looked rusty at first, but obviously overpowered the Warriors when they felt like it. Then the main guys sat out for most of the 2nd half. No worries.
Everytime skip says let's see it they never show the highlight
Wow I didn't even know the Lakers acquired Carmello.  Good analysis guys!
Rondo needs to start and WB needs to lead the second unit! Periodt!
The Warriors are BACK.!!!!!!  GIVE IT UP SHAY SHAY
Lakers honestly played MUCH better with Rondo out there as opposed to Russ. Makes the whole russ deal look pointless.
This team would’ve been Great          5 years ago
A positive spin 😂🤣
Skip : That looked like a Sam Darnold pass 🤣🤣
Im not a Lakers fan but by December James and Westbrook will find there place.
The basketball gods are still wondering: why didn’t the Lakers pick up Buddy Heild….
Wow did Shannon sharpe actually mention LeBron James’ turnovers?
They deserve it. They should have got Hield.
I am a lakers fan
Why can't Shannon just take the Johnson out his mouth and admit that Leflop is done and this crew won't get it done.
I don't understand why people think the preseason means anything
Dress wearing westrbrick will falter the lakers Tuck
Shannon said it’s going to take them a long time for the Lakers to “FIT” yeah my bulls instantly had chemistry from Game 1. Face it popularity made your Lakers trash.
Lakers straight up stink. Lebron is not what he use to be. Westbrook is all over the place and AD injury prone.
LeBron caught the turnover fever??? Haha, please, him and Westbrook are king and prince respectively
Melo has been the best Laker this preseason
Father time has knocked on Lebrons door...Westbrook is gonna be westbrook & won't be brodie for another 6 months..AD is gonna fadeaway himself into an injury & turn into street clothes ,if he keeps playn the 4..Carmelo,Munk & Rondo's gonna shine..
Warriors should continue to play with they’re bench and Wiggins until they go under 600 win pct. They looked good.Chemistry was on point
Still time to hop on the Bulls bandwagon, Shannon. Don’t get caught flat-footed.
We really acting like pre-season matters. Are the Timberwolves suddenly title favorites, now?
4 Hall of Famers? Dwight Howard going to the hall without any doubt. Let's say 5 hall of famers
Rondo-PG Russ-SG Melo-SF Bron-PF Davis-C
Same old song and dance
LA needs 2 balls
I knew it ,when I heard that RW was coming to the Lakers,that it was one of the biggest trade blunder in the history of the Lakers ! This is ridiculous; A huge and exorbitant pay ,but lukewarm play ! I hope so bad ,that I am wrong !
Russell Westbrook is a leader he's not going to take back seat to no one and that's including LeBron James
Skip this is preseason calm down homie your to exited 🤦🏾‍♂️
I know these shows need things to talk about but they didn’t even run an offense most of the 1st half and nobody important played the 4th.
Melo definitely makes the 75th Team over T-Mac. T-Mac has NEVER made it out of the first round of the Playoffs and he's had more help than Melo.
Russ need to shoot more. A lot of his turnovers coming from wild pass attempts
Season hasn’t started yet.  Chill.
They trash
Allen Iverson: The answer   Russell Turnover Westbrick: The problem
7:35 yea skip JUST EXPOSED THE NBA
Russ is a lot of the time speeding things up when he sometimes always shouldn’t, resulting in turnovers, he needs to slow it down sometime. He needs to try and fit his role as a athletic slashing/feeding to the open shooters defender role on the team like they need him. Or run him off the bench and start rondo.
This is lakers first time playing with each other warriors 3 years plus also we been in every game in the beginning we will be dominated
Don’t sleep on Utah
"That looked like a Sam Darnold pass" lol
Westbrook should stand behind lebron when lebron drives when lebron drives pass to Westbrook. If he’s about to be in trouble pass back to lebron who should drive again and continue until there’s a hole in the defense
Too many old guys
Skip & Shannon like Russ, Russ, Russ wyd 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
“Russel Westbrook #0 Rings” 😂😂😂
"Number 0 rings" caught me off guard 😂
Chemistry is the key. We will see how the the Lakers season pan out.
Shannon’s suit is excellent. Where did you get it?
when you win you don't learn anything. it's better that they get out all the risky plays early so they know what works
THEY NOT GIVING PROPS TO THE WARRIORS?! 🤦🏾‍♂️
Melo being on the 75th Anniversary Team would be a Joke
Now this was just embracing to take an L from a team when you have your star players in and the other team has theirs out. lol
Institute the triangle
Put some respect on Jordan Pooles name
Why did neither of you mention the Lakers horrible defense. This seemed to be more the problem than the turn overs
0-5 dam
This is staged.  It's preseason.  It's makes the championship much better.  Their not gonna lose in a playoff series
Shannon doing nothing but giving a million excuses for Lefraud Blames the love of his life.
Skip "Water Gun" Bayless 1st ballot HOF'er 1.4 ppg in his senior year. He was his teams pistol pete
I have a suggestion for the Lakers’ front office: make Russell Westbrook play with the second unit ,as he doesn’t fit with the unit of Lebron and AD; Or better yet trade him for the disgruntled Kyrie Irving; Kyrie will bring huge upgrade to the Lakers , as he knows how to play with Lebron; Also ,he is very mature ,who reverted to Islam ; The Lakers always win big ,when Muslims are in their midst(Abdul Jabbar, Jamal Wilkes,….)!
Y'all crazy if you think the Lakers not going to be great this season.
Melo to la
Shannon looks so stressed in the thumbnail
In 2003 the Lakers put together a dream team, and we still lost. It’s not about the people. It’s about how they work collectively. 🤦🏾‍♂️🦾
They lost to a G league squad 😂😂😂
HAHA, Skip and Shannon acting like Russ hasn't "played out of control" his entire career. Good luck with that Lakers.
Russ plays hero ball, all his offense creation and crazy passing has lost his team more games than they've won. I don't know why they would start Russ instead of Dwight.
Why don't they show clips when shannon or skip is looking at the monitor explaining their play-by-play?🤔
Well.. look like Timmy Turners gonna have a pull a KD.
Uncle sharp is a real one he goes on the show and keep it 💯 win or lose
If you think you can win a title with Westbrook running the show LOL yeah ok
It’s pre-season.  Can we move on please? Lmao
LeBron is not a better passer than cp3
LMAO it has begun.  This will not work!
" Its the LA-ARP Lakers"!
It’s preseason guys its  all about healthy
It seems like Westbrook never figured out situations he’s very dumb as a decision maker if it wasn’t for his numbers and athleticism he wouldn’t be in the league…he literally doesn’t know which moves to deploy to win a game…everytime he gets the ball it’s a mystery box on what he’ll decide to do even though millions know what he should be doing at that moment lol
Trade Russell Westbrook for Kyrie Irving,as soon as the Lakers have a chance to do so ; RW looks disjointed,and completely out of his elements ,so to speak; He doesn’t fit with Lebron and AD ; Trade him ,when you have the chance ,and get rid of his albatross and insane salary : 44 Millions Dollars per year ; I wouldn’t pay one fourth for his rapidly decreasing talent and athleticism
The way skip says “Russ? Russ?” makes me chuckle every time 🤣
Anyone else notice, all of a sudden Shannon ain’t cocky
Why is he expecting them to go hard in a preseason is what I don’t understand
No credit to GSW…….just disrespectful…… Lakers lost at home……to half a GSW team…..
Man. He just gave away the NBA Finals this season. I thought about posting it, but naa. I'm good at this so I won't do that for free.
If wiseman plays better D Klay play like he did 2 yrs ago there right back in it cuz Poole a beast with Lee looney  Avery Bradley and AI off the bench 💯💯💯
They look better with Rondo at the point!!!!
PRESEASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pause o 0:00 look a jenn face dam 😂
Lakers are washed
Hats off to Shannon and skip they both are true scholars when speaking the truth.
LeHelp makes players better .. 🤦🏽‍♂️ lol
Skip laughing while watching the Russ lowlights was hilarious. 😂
They are going to have to play full speed and gel for a while before it clicks. Preseason can't help get Russ ready because he wants to go 120mph
Shannon changing his tune .....skip first guessed it from the time Russ joined the team , skip said it was not a natural fit and Russ has to have the ball and is a turnover machine.....Sharpe saying naah, the goat going to make it work ,we good ....now Sharpe repeating exactly what skip said from the beginning....idiot.....
Mr. 0 rings haha, Skip has the best nicknames
Are people being paid to NOT bring up how much better the Warriors are looking than the entire NBA media projected??? It's like the biggest story of the preseason, and no one's talking about it.
Skip: Sometimes I think even I could make the NBA Hall of Fame Jalen Rose: 🧐
Its PRE SEASON. The aim isnt to win its to TRY THINGS. It was the same with the Wizards early, Russ needs to figure out whos running with him and whos dragging they feet.  The Lakers gonna need to either speed up or Russ gonna need to slow down. Yall talk about guys needing time to gel then jump to conclusions after 2 or 3 PRE SEASON games.
Westbrook can't blend in with anyone. Super talented but he's a one man show.
The media will have an all time field day this season talkin about the Lakers. Btw, the season has even started yet and LA has 3 hurt players.
All our SG hurt 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
It's only preseason like chill
I still don’t understand why they get Westbrook over Buddy Hield which would’ve costed less, who made Dwayne Wade realize it was time to retire. LeBron will still be pg and they didn’t think they were getting rondo back but would u imagine if they had Buddy smh
You got Russell play the off-the-ball with the Lakers more  It's a process man!!!   LeBron play some point guard  You can let Carmelo point guard  We going to what they do!!!!
Health is going to take a toll on the older players. Haven't even started the season and one of my favorite players in Ariza is out for 2 months. I hope these guys stay healthy if they are going to win a chip.
Skip said he treats it like a football 🤣🤣🤣
Faker nation
As I said on the last Lakers video, The Warriors are licking their chops come opening night. Its going to be a scoring banaza on these old Lakers lol 😂
Lonzo looking real good now huh Lakers?
No one  Skip:Russ russs russssssssss Everyone:😭😭😭😭
Curry didn’t even play lmao
Nuggets in 4
Lost to the warriors bench LMAO!!!! WOW
The Lakers are a team with many pieces with no working parts.
Chicago going look like a team to beat
Lakers = play in lmfaooo watch
I could be wrong but I just don't believe a team with Russell Westbrook winning a championship
Friendly reminder that both suns and bucks finished without a win last preseason, and look how that season ended, so let's just see how this plays out when it matters?
Impossible to dribble a football?? Have you heard of Allen iverson?
Skip looks sleepy
Now I'm no NBA EXPERT  I never played in the NBA   But Skip, I'm almost 10000% positive every PLAYER in the HOF algorithm than 1.2 points per game ..   I'm almost certain of it   Someone fact check me
Russell Westbrook put up nice stats in an ugly game. 😑😑😑 Westbrook has to give the ball up outside the 3-point line (not deep in the paint) and relocate to the opposite wing.
Limit Russ minutes to 26-28. Until he can stop turn overing the ball.
If KD had played with with any point guard other than Westbrook when he was with OKC he would have had at least 5 championships.  Lakers are not going to make it to the playoff.   Westbrook is not only bad but he also makes everyone next to him looks real bad
Well. .  expectation is just that.  Look unbeaterble on paper, but on court???? Not so much.... Go Lakers??? Let's just hope that is their plans to fool every one.
Lakers better start to worry
Excuses excuses
I’m gonna first call this” Kylie Irving trade for Russell Westbrook “. If I’m laker GM I’m making some calls to Brooklyn
I already make my prediction for the Lakers this year. But if you people miss it, here I go again…… Lakers going to end up 8 place , eliminate in the first round and if the first round is against the Warriors, they are going to be 🧹. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shannon so nice and friendly when Bron plays bad 😂
Lakers need to trade Westbrook for kyrie. Then the OKC big three wouldm be back together
He said focus was on LBJ!! Im glad they not showing his videos!!! I guess they did nth nice
9-11 in the 1st 20 games…it’ll start 2 come 2getha after that…
I believe lebron picked russ amd carmelo since they are his friends. Lebron probably only care about his self or just want his friends to atleast get a title so he is forcing the situation. We should have stuck with buddy and derozen.
It's already brewing, there telling us who's going to be the escape Goat, instead of the fake Goat LeBron.
He will not say how good the D looked at times
So it's pre season game and Lebron is closing 37. Skip is funny and this show too.
So who better now Lonzo Ball or Kuzma lol y'all funny
How come we dnt get 2 see tha replays anymore? Even tho ii kno EXACTLY wat they be tlkin about , ii STILL wanna see tha replays!!! Tha producer & editor's need get it together dawg...
360? More like 180. Russ is not prime time material. He’s a stat padder.
I think it's going to work out fine ..it's 2 much fire power on dis team..when lebron,a.d,Russ and melo on the court I'm fully confident we can score with anybody😂😂
It’s just pre season guys let’s all get a grip
I think after All-Star break they are going to be the Lakers, ofcourse if healthy
As expected the warriors get no respect Jordan Poole mainly he’s been killing all preseason
Lakers. Could hundred molions smoke.
Skip funny af 😂
Last super team lebron had got split up because they couldnt play together i can see a couple but u got all that talent over there tryn melo is my boy but i feel sorry for him
I know there are receipts of y'all saying KD should have won with Russ. Now y'all trying to say he's a turnover waiting to happen with LeBron. Not the same energy y'all gave him earlier 🤣😂
in today's nba... lebron ranks 23rd in passer rating and passing efficiency!!!! how is a  23rd ranked passer the best passer in the league or even worse the best passer the game has ever seen?lmfao lmfao lmfao nevermind the fact lebron is the ALL TIME TURNOVER LEADER IN NBA HISTORY!!! LMFAO LMFAO LMFAO clickbait views create clickbait trash!!!
The thrill is gone for them. Russ doesn't belong on that team! And Lebronica need to stop trying to build teams around her.......I mean him.🤦😁
The turnovers are happening because the games don't matter yet
This might sound crazy, but Russ shouldn't start.
Lakers have more problems than just how well Russ & LeBron adjust to not being so ball dominant. Also, Dwight Howard is becoming a big version of Pat Bev, really annoying
I’ve never seen preseason being this important to people ever since Russ came to LA
1-2 months to get it together in the west will be DISASTROUS for the Lakers.
said it from jump...this Lakers team will struggle to even reach the post-season
"That look like a pass from Sam Darnold" I'm dead 🤣😂😂😂😂
Bron has had some high turnover games the last 3 years lol. Before russ
I do think Skips 0.4 ppg would be enough for the basketball hall of fame
It preseason Jesus
I really wish they didn’t go out and get Westbrook Hield should have been the guy they brought in
it’s preseason
I am so going to love this Lakers collapse... It's good for the NBA!  Tired of hearing about one or two teams every day 😆😆
Just take the ball Bron.. and work off of AD.. stop trying to appease ppl.. man I wish we got cp3 instead
I love when skip is right 😂
If I were the Lakers, I would be really worried about their bench.  Their big 3 will be fine during the season and in the playoffs but their bench is garbage.
With all these problems the Lakers and the Nets are having, Giannis is rubbing his hands together like Birdman 😂😂, Bucks in 6 on repeat 💪💪💯💯
Take care of the football ! 🤣
bro chill it’s preseason 😂😂😂😂😂
Start Rondo at PG!!!! Let Russ come off the bench!!! That will be crazy!!!!
Westbrook had a combined 28 turnovers in 5 games
Wtf was that game last night 😐😐 Lakers should have one 💀
on notha note, my Ws are DDEEEP this year....baby
Shannon any and everyone NBA said this was going to happen. 😂😂😂  Shannon giving a positive spin on the cowboys during the preseason???? I don’t remember all that. Lol
The Lakers make skip seem like the smartest man in the world
This time period has as much relavency come April as what I ate in March.
Lol. People love to talk at the begining but quiet when bron running through the finals.
I’ve seen Allen iverson dribble a football
1000th comment
I’m a dubs fan but it’s preseason, who cares. Nows the time for the Lakers to try stuff out, they’re a play when the playoffs come team.
bron played with D wade (star on his team) (bosh) also a star and ball dominant,  Kevin love star on his team and ball dominant.. lebron knows how to win with anybody in my opinion...
if it's not a natural fit... then it's not a fit.  you can wear thick socks for oversized shoes or thin socks for undersized shoes... the shoes still don't fit.
The Lakers looked old and slow on defense!
Shannon please,the Lakers could not beat, Warriors with B team!
Lakers bubble ring Doesnt count But the preseason does??? Crazy
Bron - PG Russ - SG Melo - SF AD - PF Superman - C  Simple as that.
I can only offer my assistance UNTIL...THE SEASON STARTS!!!
Feels like Unc is gonna have many these days this season. 😂
WNBA FINALS are tonight and we’re debating a preseason nba game ..
Westbrook is not a Big 3 player.. big joke.. Mistake.. let Rondo play.. should never signed Westbrook.. there’s a reason he has no rings..
Idk why people are freaking out it’s the preseason, they’re playing like they’re not taking the preseason seriously and are experimenting to see what works during games.
RUSS DOESN’T BELONG ON ANY TEAM! He’s a street baller. He belongs in THE RUCKER. 😂😂😂😂
Cant wait to see bron havin a fight with russ vice versa
lol why we not breaking down and analyzing the other games so far this hard?
Shannon, just admit it.. They are old and done!! It's not going to happen...
😂😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
They are all past their primes, at least it's funny to watch LA Jokers
Westbrook wanting to be a player that he ain’t ! a passers
Thumbnail hit different
Did skip just call Jordan Poole a “dozen” 😐😐😐😐
Rondo and AD are the big ticket with this team, kinda forget everyone else is on it. I think AD has the potential to be like Dirk with his shot creating, which we all know was unguardable, even Kobe borrowed from Dirk.
GSW's winning the chip.
Next season flakers
Oh now Shannon says its gonna take longer. Lol
Start rondo bench Ross. No egos
Stop being shocked when Westbrook gets turnovers. He by far has the highest turnovers per game average in NBA history.
Russ is the guy in pick up ball thats throws the ball at the back of your head while you're setting a screen for that one guy who's been knocking down 3s all day and then he gets mad because you didn't catch the pass.
The only way they can be success is thru fastbreak and defense also rondo should start
Ask Allen Iverson about dribbling a football
I like these two 😂
6 + 9 is 15?
Only in preseason lol  Sa season pa yan mag seryuso
They don't need him to facilitate and pass tho.. they got enough of that with LeBron..rondo Damn just run pick and roll with him ..mid range or lob .. easy and effective
All of y’all are super casual fans. It seems y’all don’t understand what CHEMISTRY in sports means. Real fans of any team sport understands how important it is to build chemistry with a new team. It’s also the effin’ PRESEASON! 😂😂😂
Nobody cares.
Hard to imagine 3 guys who love to pad the stat line not working out 🏋️ Brady must have deflated the balls 🏀.
The Bulls are gunna win a chip.
Lakers fans you know you won't be able to use that "It's only preseason calm down" forever right?
I mean the turnover is going to be high considering both russ and Bron lose the ball. What matters is how many turnovers can be overcome by the Lakers scoring
Impossible to dribble a football?  Skip never heard of Allen Iverson?
All the warriors doing the curry movement
I'll be surprised if this roster will be the same after next trade deadline
No curry or klay and lost? 😂😂😂
Skip really acts like he was the greatest player when he played lol
First of all it's a preseason game so stop the damn 🧢 and besides it's going to take time for them to figure it out it's a whole bunch of moving pieces brand new moving pieces so chill out be patient God damn y'all just expect perfection overnight Rome wasn't even built  in one day stop the 🧢!
Can someone please tell skip the clown to start blowing his nose before he gets on the air thanks in advance
Someone answer my question? How come Undisputed DOESN'T show plays/highlights (on YouTube)? Bc they do on cable tv🤔
🔥
Bulls >>>>Lakers. Lavine, Ball, DeRozan>>>>> LeCry, Davis, Westbrick....
I been saying it’s one ball 😂 y’all slow
Labrick James & Russell westbrick 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Since everyone else can catch and shoot, they should let Russell play his game and adapt to him. Let Russell lead the charge.
Russ needs to learn how to pace himself
Remember Lebron said keep that same energy when everyone said our team was old. Lmaoo yeah get Lebron tf off my team
They gone trade Russ before the playoffs lmao
respecting teams built step by step with a project, not one year winning teams
Why can’t they talk about how warriors played. Jordan Poole was 🔥. They literally spent 19 mins talking only about lakers and why they lost🤦🏾‍♀️
This the lakers last chance of winning a title and I don’t think it’s gonna happen
One game
Keep sleeping on my clippers don’t be surprised when we win it all in June
Who winning the preseason championship gosh.This serious smh.
They looked actually like they’re gonna be. A old slow team right now but injury riddled in the end period
Westbrook for Lillard -- do it already.
Hold on wait so if you block a shot and get the ball back that’s not a turnover ??!?! That’s  so dumb lol
Ahhh Joker james. Lost again. Their are so many better players.
They said AD looked good?? I swear he airballed a three and missed a few, remember what they’re called,   “free throws”
In a Meanwhile the tough guys in MIAMI HEAT are doing amazing!! 4-0👍
Lakers gotta figure out their lineup situation.  It’s a HUGE disaster if they start : WB, Bazemore, Bron, AD, Jordan.  No spacing for Bron or WB to slash & create. Little to no consistent 3 point shooting ( Bron & WB need shooters surrounding them) & no space for AD to go to work on the paint with DJ on the court
The 2004 Lakers all over again, hopefully not but it could be.
Relax Los Angeles! The 'Steve Nash' Lakers had their rough patches and everything worked out okay!
Lakers 2nd round exit
Skip didn't have to do sam darnold like that ☠
Why they stopped showing the videos ?🤔
Warriors basketball I told people we will be hard to stop this year plus the beat def in the nbd town bizz 💪🏿
Lakers just need identity they should be good!
Find it hilarious how these bron stans are complaining about russ turning the ball over when lebron himself is the turnover king 🤴
It's preseason
This team gives me Eagles “Dream Team” vibes. It just does. Too much on one team in my opinion.
BIG 3 🤣🤣 fukin JOKES. Can't even win one pre-season game even when other teams real stars ain't even playing. Ontop of that injury already started for the lakers and the regular season hasn't even started 🤣
You can’t win with Russell Westbrook he is an individual.Russ belongs in OKC where he should stay and retire
damn when you have a Rolls Royce that runs like a Prius!
Lakers got beat by a Warriors team with no Klay, no Curry, no Green, No Wiseman. And yet they had all three of their stars playing? It’s the preseason sure, but don’t be using that excuse during the regular season. This is giving me some 2017-2018 Cavs or OKC vibes rn
Skip being Skip. Thinking he's the smartest than anybody else. I wonder why he's still in the business? lol
He treats the basketball like a football 😃😂😂 (Westbrook)
*Itll take some time, but they looked COMPLETELY lost. It was almost like YMCA play. Free for all*
Westbrook needs to come off the bench
“That looked like a Sam Darnold pass…” 🤣🤣 why skip whyyy u do him so dirty 🤣
Whoever said clippers under radar, please, clippers have never been on anybody's radar, look up in raptors and see how many banners they got hanging??
Russ needs to come off the bench
Raleigh Simmons Coached by Fred Tex Winter. I will help you, Frank. Russell needs to get the ball first and push while Lebron is going to need to run THE LANES HARD AND STEADY. Lebron run the lanes and let Russell bring the ball up or Give it all to RONDO Frank he can bring it together. Rondo, Russell, Lebron, AD whos next?
Wow! Just simply look at how Lebron James constructed this older group of players and what is not shown is his lack of intellectual ability to discern that these guys are not winning any Championship unless those corrupt officials do what they do best for these shallow NBA fans!! Utterly pathetic to watch!!😎🤣😃😎🤣🤣
Wow I’m so sad and worried because preseason is super important., it matters more then the finals… wow I’m so scared for our season based off my judgement during PRESEASON
No need for monk and Nunn. They are streaky players (i.e. nick young, etc.) Good for a show, not for the Lake Show.   We need all around type of players
The way the Lakers looked at each other last night is the same way Lebron and Wade looked at each other their first year together....I just hope it's a different result
Who cares...... this is preseason. Yes I'm hoping the Lakers fall flat on their faces this season and lay an egg in the playoffs. But this is an over analysis of a preseason game.
I’m just keeping a close eye on Franki V 👀🥸
They should of got Chris paul
But there's are pro  basketball  players  just play basketball  pick cut  the basics
Russell gonna have to take over games James needs rest
Russ should come off the bench and they should start melo.
Should of kept Caruso,  and added DeRozan or B. Hield
Gotta give these guys credit, they can get thousands of people to watch a 20 minute discussion of pre-season turnovers.
LeBron gonna avg. 25 12 7
So, you mean to tell me that The Los Angeles Lakers lost to The Warrior's bench?! I'm surprised Shannon didn't call out today 🤣🤣
Russ looks lost or the whole team
good thing Lonzo already has the Ball
RW is always like that in any new team but the moment he clicks it's...over
To be honest with you Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony supposed to be a LA Lakers LeBron James grab them for his Legacy to get more rings
Warriors gonna cook dat asz all season, brah.
Never liked westbrook never will!  Skip is right this time it’s just not going to work with that guy
Brodie gonna have gray hairs sprouting everywhere with fans 🤣
BIG OLD 3
2004 Lakers repeat
current stats per 36 mins: Westbrick's  = 10 pt / 14%fg / 37 3pt% (WOOW) / 75%FT / 9.5 RB / 7.5 AS / 10 TO   RONDO= 8.2 pts/ 58.3% fg / 66.7% 3pt% / FT N/A but we know more than 75% / 9.6 rb / 8.2 ast / 4.1 TO   GIVE ME MORE RONDO WITH THE IMPORTANT LINEUPS, GIVE WestBrick 2n unit / garbage time please!!!
Russ took that skirt off finally ?
Skiiiiippppppppppp…. 🤣
Am I’m the only one who thinks the lakers should if they could trade for Ben Simmons?
The chemistry isn’t working probably going to be hard for lakers
Lebron Me7o Ad real big 3‼️‼️‼️
agree with rondo being a quarterback for LAL, WB can go with 2 and LBJ 3, Melo 4, and AD 5. i dont think russ have what it takes to become a playmaker like rondo did, he's a scorer not a playmaker
Lakers don’t have an offensive identity, and aren’t nearly as good on defense as they get credit for. They couldn’t stop a nose bleed last night ….. and the Warriors were terrible as it relates to 3 pt shooting, but the were able to get ANY shot they wanted. At some point you gotta run plays if you’re LA. - Didn’t see that.
Where is the footage from NBA?
Westbrook needs to come off of the bench with Melo
This the preseason yo damn chill please
Westbruk doesn't deserve this Cali weather ship him back to the East 🤚
Bulls are where its at lakers are trash
First round exit
you guys need to realize lebron is old and im pretty sure hes looking for somebody else to make plays. he doesnt wanna burn out before the playoffs. westbrook will play better as the season goes on. its a new team, hes still adjusting to make plays for his teammates
No excuses. They are bad. Skip and I have the same thought. The big three got pulled so they wouldn't get embarrassed by the Warriors bench.
Pistol Pete can't make the basketball Hall of Fame
Calling Anthony Davis a Hall of Famer is shameful.
We was just need kyle lowry but i hope lakers build chemistry
LeBron signed off on this
Ship might be right about Westbrook
Everybody need to pump their breaks the lakers will figure it out trust me, to many smart minds and too much experience, it’s not rock science it Sacrifices!!!
People really acted like Russ would become an efficient scorer and not turnover prone overnight
We are really breaking down which players is going to get what shots lol.. I think we're overthinking this the Lakers have i  repeat Anthony Davis LeBron James and Russell Westbrook on the same team I'll take my chances in a playoff series with that
As usual. Yall over reacting. Come mid season youll be crying lebron has too much help. Its coming
So Shannon is admitting that the stats are rigged
Imagine Lebron spotting up
Skip was hilarious this episode
Wake me up when it's June please and it's Lakers versus the Nets
If this is what it looks like after practice sessions and bond meetings and tape watching, i cannot imagine how bad it would have been initially. Need to calm down. Ominous signs :(
Is the nets interested in Westbrook trading for Kyrie? Better deal than none.
Bring Russ off the bench, problem solved
Russ Russ Drake Drake
RUSS😂😂 skip is hilarious
Lakers are gonna be just fine. I believe in Russ.
I think it's going to be hard to keep that many older players with egos healthy and in team mode to win in the playoffs.
Trust and believe Lebron will address this with Russ
I forgot what year was it but lakers was 0-8 in preseason and they fired the head coach.
ITS A PRE-SEASON GAME AGAINST GOLDEN STATE. WHAT RESULT WAS LEBRON OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER EXPECTING ? A 40  POINT BLOWOUT ?
Russ has never made his team or other players better. This will prove to be a desperate move for the Fakers.
Its the pre-season!!!..Skipp be reaching🤣😂
Media already setting up Russ to be the fall guy of the lakers don’t look great smh !
It’s crazy they skip doesn’t count the bubble but he’s so invested in the preseason 🤦🏽‍♂️
“WELCOME TO THE PRE SEASON” where lottery teams are UNDEFEATED 😂😂😂
This proves that KD decision was right, staying in OKC with westbrick would leave him ringless for the rest of his career
Ya gotta realize it’s a whole new team things don’t click fast
…did skip backhandedly give lebron a compliment
Worst part of russ’s game has always been his decision making.
I'm intrested in what is gonna happen with the nets before the season starts and the lakers injury's... because if this keeps up the JAZZ WILL TAKE THE FINALS
They already setting up Russ to be blamed if the Lakers season ends up in disaster.
missing 4 players is gonna make the adjustment period longer, players coming in and out can hurt. like the ad and russ connection. davis seems locked in on defense and him at the 5 looks good
Lakers will be fine.
Nobody plays sports to lose. May it be pre-season, team scrimmage, or in your local gym. No excuses.
The kurse of Kuzma
Man as long as Westbrook being playing and he still turns the ball over like this...it wont change. Its a reason why he has been on so many teams just out if control.. I think rondo would do better they have shooters
Melo and russ getting traded
Dwight5, AD4, Melo3, Russ2, and LBJ1 positions and starting 5/closing 5.
The best basketball intelligence is not Lebron, it's CP3 SKIP.
The Lakers will get bounced out of the playoffs right away if they even get in
Bron needs younger skilled players, instead of a bunch of vets that cant really run on fast break
I’d rather them talk about the bulls tbh.
Do y’all know the lakers are not even trying to win these games clowns 🤡
It Is PRESEASON!!! CHILL!!!
is it copyrights why they cant use video while speaking? haven't watched this show in awhile.
Chemistry disaster!!
Can WestBrick be limited for 30 or less mins per contest? please!!!! and Rondo Checks in immediately for Westbrook? wesbrook NOT sharing that many mins with LeBron & AD! NO 4th qrt Westbrook PLEASE!!!
Whoops lol
Skip i love the hate even n preseason
The point of preseason is to make mistakes and iron our your kinks. What's the use in playing preseason games and making everyone see your expected positioning and by the time the season starts, all teams knows your plays and weaknesses?
You can already tell that Westbrook won't really fit in here, and he's going to be the fall guy for this team.
All they seem “to work on” is defense but they need to focus on offense too because they are not a naturally good scoring team
Russ had a rough start with the Rockets & the Wizards so I am not panicking yet. The team has the same issues from the previous two seasons, TO’s FT’s & 3PT%. They better clean those up asap.
The Lakers need to feed the ball to whoever hot🔥. They're making the same mistakes the Dream Team made by showing too much respect for your own teammates which causes over passing the ball causing turnovers
NBA does Not start till after the AllStar Game
Russel needs to learn how to play without the ball in his hands in order for this to work, Labron will have to lead this offense for this to work!!!
Sorry Skip...1.4 ppg isn't enough to get you in
This is the 99' rockets all over again. Doomed to fail
westbrook should come of the bench. rondo is a much better floor general.
2010 allstar team ahahaha
Lebronze fans its only the pre season 😂
This is entertainment. What we say and think has no bearing on actual outcomes. Some analysts actually use analysis to predict while others create hysteria and controversy. Skip is a great actor and Shannon is an outstanding co star.
It’s just preseason
No Steph, no Klay, no Draymond, No Wiseman. Lakers still loss...??? What a trash 🗑.
Maybe next season Leact.
I'm waiting for a "practice" talk
Skip...The NFL Hall of Fame is Harder BC there are 3 separate entities to the sport...Basketball is 5 on 5 with all 3 Football entities in 1....! Basketball players are required to play offense, defense and special teams (free throws)....! And the obvious is..Football has more players than Basketball...!
We will be fine I’m getting sick of the doubt
This feels like the Cavs team that looked good on paper and looked "Better" than what they used to be, but they completely regretted getting Dwade, Isaiah Thomas, Derrick Rose, etc.
These games are important for building chemistry, I didn't really expect them to win though. The first ten regular season games are gonna be important too, hopefully they'll start clicking by then. If not, they're gonna be in big trouble.
give russ the second unit to run with in a james harden on the nets role because he’s so good at doing more with less
I WAS watching the Giants/Dodgers game.
20 turnovers in 6 quartes is COMICAL
There's archival footage of Iverson dribbling a football. It's not impossible. Just a little FYI.
Vogel could start westbrook and take him out in by 3 minutes, than come back leading the second unit, like the nets always having one of the big three on court
We all know Lebron can’t play off the ball
preseason is preseason but jeez are they really about to go 0-6? at least 1 win would be nice just to boost up the confidence.
Imagine Klay, Dray & Steph Play Last Night? Chemistry Is Gonna Plague This Laker Team, Unless They Change The Way They Play.
Lakers were up 10 in the 3rdQ and they didn't even play Bron and AD much late in the game......and y'all worried?? Give it 10 games in the regular season before making these conclusions
Preseason boring...
Cmon man! That makeup of that team was never gonna work.
Dwight gets to push and shove, etc. It's exciting..  NO. Its a damn foul. Call it!!
they should make Russ the 2 guard and put him on the wing, his strengths are driving to the rim and rebounding, leave the passing to James, and Rondo, Russ should be a passer only if James and Rondo get injured.
Lakers would be the scariest team in the west if they had russ coming off the bench
when the lakers get rid of russ that will be the nail in his career. this is where it will go all downhill. if you cant win with lebron you cant win with anybody. nobody is gonna pay him max contracts to get triple doubles and miss the playoffs
i actually thought the lakers played good for the 2 1/2 quarters they played. Russ has played horrible, but hopefully he’ll come along.
Take Ben simmons please 🙏 make it happen Lebron 🙏  take that loser out of Philly & make him something.
Russ is a bad fit for the Lakers because he can't play off ball because he is a bad shooter and LeBron can't shoot as well
These are all the ages these Players will be during the season -  LEBRON (37)  CARMELO (37) HOWARD  (36) RONDO (36) ARIZA (36) WESTBROOK (33)  W. ELLINGTON (34  Older Great Players running on OLD LEGS,  hopefully they can play at a high level all season on those OLD LEGS
this is cosmic rich from santa cruz not meerah this is just the beginning watch out n b a warriors will dominate they are splash 14 already ta ta namaste
Why don't wess play the two...he would be a better 2 gaurd than a point.
Russ, Russ, ….Russ. Oh, Russ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The story is how deep the Warriors are looking. Let the revenge tour begin.
Nothing to worry about. King James will get the team together
When I have to agree with Skip......it's worrisome 😏
Lakers Big 3 = 🗑 🗑 🗑
Unfortunately, this is Lebron we're talking about. He'll figure it out. Until then, I'm going to enjoy this Lebron slander.
You do realize that lakers are an "old" team, and then you expect them to give an all out performance IN A PRESEASON.
Voskul can't coach this team, he definitely doesn't know how to defend the pick and roll
Comon' people we all know they'll win a ton of regular season games.  Westbrook in the playoffs is still the question mark.
its preseason
That's the Russel Westbrook effect,
I assume their not focused on winning preseason games more like it’s a focus on chemistry
How can you be the best passer in history if you are number 1 in tov In history smh he's good at passing but not the best.
A Lakers team of Shaq, Kobe, Van Exel, and Jones couldn't even beat the Jazz twice which only had two All-Stars in 1997 and 1998. It takes time. Rome wasn't built in a day. This could be another failed chemistry experiment.
No matter how good Russ is,  he always make the team he joins not so good.
Doesn’t matter if it’s preseason. Lebron, AD, Russ and Carmelo should be able to beat Wiggins and Poole even if it was at an elementary school playground during recess
I’ve never seen the media or fans put this much energy into preseason 😂
It's just a preview of what the regular season will be like
RONDO  THE PG RUSS AT SG SO HE CAN SLASH BRON AND MELO THE WINGS AD THE 5
From what I saw last night Versus the Lakers in that Pre-season game... Teams are severely underestimating that Golden State Championship DNA. If Jordan Poole provides that Ying to Curry's Yang until Klay comes back. The Bench is stronger and deeper and the ball movement/shooting from many places looks dangerous. I predicted a Western Conference Finals showdown last season for this year between the Lakers-Warriors after the tremendous play-in game. Golden State was unhealthy and the Defenses thrown at Stephen Curry were insane. I told everyone if healthy you will see a classic 7 game showdown.  I am still holding to that.
Westbrook should’ve never left okc couple more yrs n he done
The Lakers will not win another championship this year , they are the bad news bears right now lol.
Shay it dont work skip 4 Michael Jordans on 1 team
You can throw in a bunch of brand names together and we've seen it not work. It takes time to develop chemistry. Yes, LeBum, AD, Dwight, and Rondo are back together but it's just them and THT. The rest are new.
It's called *Chemistry* it takes time to develop.
When Melo caught that lob, I was like the Lakers are ready! They did look good, but Russ just looks out of place right now but they will figure it out
Can you all please add a camera that shows the highlights you're looking at? I don't understand why after all these years that still isn't a feature of the show.  You often look at highlights and comment on them, but we don't know what you're looking at.
The lakers will be alright!! Just need more time to come together!!! They still the favorites out west 💯💯
The Los Angeles Egos will set a record in turnovers this year while solidyfying their 5th place spot in the Western Conference at the end of the regular season.
A lil early for gloom and doom talk around the Lakers lol. It takes time for a new team to gel
Can't wait for the excuses to come flying in... "its only the preseason..." "this team isn't too old..."   It's going to turn into.. HOW DID THEY THINK THIS TEAM WILL WORK?  LEBRON IS TOO OLD...
The lakers will be find yall talking about preseason basketball. Now when the lakers start winning don't jump on the bandwagon them, but yall always do so whatever.
Damn it’s preseason lol 😂 they couldn’t wait for the LBA to start (Lebron Basketball Association) 😂
Westbrook trying to not play 100 mph on a team using walkers up the court.
Anthony Davis needs to play out of his mind this year, in order for them to win.
I’m surprised anybody cares. For 20 years browns and Rams went 3-1 or 4-0 every year I. PRESEASON jus to go 2-14 every year. Patriots every single year went 0-4 in preseason jus to win super bowl year after year. Do anybody actually believe anybody is trying in preseason aside form players trying to make the team.
Did Jordan Poole and Juan Toscano-Anderson play?
Someone said you start Westbrook for about 3 minutes and I would agree with that. The sooner Rondo is out there with Bron and AD the better and Brook should lead the 2nd unit.
These 2022 Fakers are still very much an experiment. Just like those 2004 and 2013 Lakers or those 2018 Cavs which had DWade, DRose, and IT. The chemistry on my Flippers and Bucks is already more developed.
I love this...all the comments below "looks ugly, skip looks like a genius." But when Lakers win it all it will be "Superteam" and "LeBron needs help to win" 😂😂
Win or lose, this will be the most fascinating lakers team to watch since the 2003-04 laker team 🍿
fire drill lol
Carmelo is a cancer.  Lebron, Russ and AD can mesh very well but Carmelo ruins the whole equation as soon as he is part of the starting lineup.
LeBron stupid need to play d that's all he got to do. Shannon the Goat Is MJ all day LeBron James need to go back to Cleveland were he belong period
The same narrative every year with Lebron
Russ has been in the NBA way too long to expect anything less man. I was with Skip on this from the beginning. LeBron really might lose the rest of his hair by the time this season ends lol.
Lakerturds should be more focused on AD. He's your future. LeBron can't play forever and Westbrook is just a third wheel that Vogel can DNP. Skip is making a big deal from a third wheel they can bench.
i wish they would show the recaps as they watch & commentate on them 😒
basically Melo and Russ gonna shoot them into some L's
I was more worried about the lakers last year cause they had defense and guys who knew their roles this years lakers are overrated they cant stop anyone anymore they're going to be light work the way they're playing now we dont even need Kyrie for them😂
Nets ship kyrie...back to lebron in lakers send russ back with kd in harden simple.....let's just get back to the old days
The reason why Lakers had a miserable season last year was because of health. But the root was the fast 71 day turnaround and Anthony Davis coming into the season out of shape. His decline was a big reason they failed.
So who are the Lakers gonna trade Russ to??
Playoff ready not fastbreak ready...💪😌
The classic doubting Lebron based on a sample size, then when he wins it’s oh he had all this help. Ya be hating fr🤦🏽‍♂️
Play your best players together and figure out what you have. Grow chemistry.  What you absolutely must not do is coach like your scared, take the easy way out and  start running out hokey lineups.  They have to play together if you ever want chemistry.  Make them learn how to play together. That's what coaching is.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Fire Drill!!!!!!!! 🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒
or we can just start rondo and have westbrook come off the bench and play with the bench unit which he can prob fit with more
Exactly what I thought would happen. Win or lose, I knew everyone would overreact to the Lakers pre season games😂. Now if they have a record like 10-10 or 11-9 after the first 20 games then everyone will have the right to down them. But now to say they will be a bust or won't make the playoffs because of some pre season games (that don't matter in the grand scheme of things) is hilarious
Warriors went 4-0 and beat the Lakers big 3 by double digits without Steph, Klay and Draymond, but they're STILL getting the cold shoulder from the media.. Warriors are gonna make yall pay for sleeping this season.
Ahh yes the thumbnail 🔥🔥🍻🍺
They are having too much fun using curse words on t.v😂
Russ rn is playing worse than any other nba player I’ve ever seen play in the history of the league rn😂
Deep down Skip is the 2nd biggest Goat James Fan AFTER ME! Lol
😈 Heat fan
Lakers will still win the chip without Westbrick. Him getting injured might benefit them more. The most valuable Laker is AD. He needs to look stronger. He's going to carry the franchise beyond LeBron's retirement.
I always said this would never work. WB is who he is. Can’t make a square peg fit a round hole 🤷🏾‍♂️
This was the first game the 3 played this preseason? Well lets hope they get their act together, right?
Lakers gon be trash this year
Y’all do realize this is their FIRST game together they’re just trying to get a feel for each other on the court at the same time… GS has had this same roster together for nearly 2 years , everyone knows the sets & their role. No different when the Spurs would rest their starts and still beat good to great teams because of knowing the system. Anyone who watches basketball should know the Lakers still don’t know what system they’re running it looks like a pickup game. Give credit to the GS team and coaching staff. This is on Vogel, he has his work cut out to figure out how this team needs to play to be successful. This team is capable of dominating they just need more game reps together. I guarantee everyone will try to say it’s an all star team when they start beating everyone. Stop overreacting, every team has a bad night.
Yeah, rondo, hield, melo, bron and AD would be a whole lot better starting five. Love russ, but damn that was a shot in the dark and hits the lakers foot 🤦🏽‍♂️
I don't think so 🤔
I watched a bit of it and they were just turnover machines for a lil while
Hey, don’t forget about MLB undisputed! Just letting y’all now, it’s the MLB post season right now. Lol
LOOL @ meanwhile, back at the ranch.
God y’all gotta chill in the comment section it’s just pre season. Stop flip flopping after everything you see lol it’s going to take some time
Will THA' 360°💛🏀🌴LAKERZ!!!.....MAKE' A' 360° TURNAROUND.....FOR' TITLE💜💛☀🌴🏆🏀RUN!!!????? STAY' TUNED'!!!!
If Klay is healthy, and is most of what he was. Then I think the Warriors can beat the Lakers in a playoff series.
Lakers fans better be glad that this is the preseason................because at this rate, LeBron wouldn't make the playoffs with the way they're playing. I think they'll be ok, but the rest of the Western Conference is waiting to beat up on the Lakers lol
U can tell they are not trying lol people are trippin
It's fitting Lakers Big will finally figure and mesh it out when the next season starts meaning "360 days" from now.  3 - Davis 6- James 0-Westbrook
Don't be shocked if Rondo is the starting point guard come playoffs for the Lakers. His chemistry with AD is excellent. Better than LeBron and AD together.
They need to let Russ bring the ball down and they need to play off the ball but he gotta be a pg not a allstar
Shannon is just as passionate about the Lakers as Skip is with the Cowboys lol hilarious
People talk about “its preseason”, but Chicago just got together and they are already showing amazing chemistry. Practice is suppose to translate on the court to see where you stand as a team and not individuals
It's pre season ! Chill !  I don't know why do we always have to talk about LeBron ! Always everyday it's LeBron LeBron LeBron ! Give that guy a break and cover some other athletes !   When there are no games they start the debate who's the greatest.
Lord skip baseless is a joke
I don’t really care cause it’s preseason.
This is like that cavs team in 2018 and then they traded everyone away at the deadline 😂
Who’s going to lead the league in turnovers this season lebron or Russel?? They’re always top 2
Lets Go Brandon!!!
Listen to what a flip flopper Skip Bayless is here. Just two weeks ago, he was bashing Rondo. I told ya before, Rondo works well with AD. Rondo had nobody to throw lobs to with my Clippers.
I guess they haven't seen enough of Westbrook yet to know that it's better to have Rondo start at the point. Westbrook will retire as the best player to never have won anything, right after CP3, lol
Dear Undisputed producers, nothing is more annoying than watching Skip and Shannon while they’re watching the highlights that we should be able to see. Y’all gotta fix it!
Russell Westbrook will deal with EXPECTATIONS he's never dealt with before. Same with Carmelo Anthony. Andre Drummond couldn't handle it. Many former All-Stars don't.
Bro ITS THE PRE SEASON WTFFF. People looking into these games like they the finals.
Lebron been turning it over. Been leading the NBA a couple years now
It's not even the real season. They'll have the line up set before it starts.
Lakers in 6! - You heard it here.
i dont want to hear anything when we hoist that trophy in June
I love how my Clippers have no expectations. We lose to the Timberwolves by 30 pts or extend Terance Mann until 2025 and the national media doesn't notice. Better when expectations aren't there.
It's not gonna work! Didn't work in Portland when they had pippen! Kemp! Wells. Anderson Steve smith! And didn't work in Houston. All older players. Lakers won against blazer's. Houston didn't go far
“All of a sudden I start counting LeBrons turnovers”- Skip Haha
1. Los Angeles Lakers 2. Brooklyn Nets (even with Kyrie) 3. Milwaukee Bucks 4. Phoenix Suns 5. LA Clippers? (maybe. 🤫)
Lakers didn’t like the poole party
It’s pre season why do people read into it so much lol
Russ should run the second unit most of the time
ITS PRESEASON‼️‼️🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Don't worry Shannon Sharpe, if they don't get it together. The NBA will let the GM trade everything and everyone at the half way point in the season like they did for Lebron James in the past. And if that isn't enough to fix it he can trade til the end of the season, like they have done in the past for Lebron James.
Russ is a 2, not a 1, never a 1.
I love russ but fam gone have too come off the bench....
KYRIE IRVING is going to be the hot topic all week. He's not going to get vaccinated because he would've done it already and we're only 6 days away from opening night. He might announce retirement at any day now.
Goes back to the question the interviewer asked Russ did the warriors win this game or did the lakers lose this game
Thank you sweet Jesus it's football season 🙏🏾
Buddy Hield would  been a lot better fit for the Lakers, and they probably still could have kept KCP.
Looked good? Nah🤣
“Caught the westbrook fever”? Really….so now russ is the only player to have games with 5+ turnovers….. cmon bro alot of the stars avg 3.5+ for a season. Skip tries hard for these narratives
It just the preseason calm down.
Russ should've dropped the Documentary AFTER this season and not before...that's just unnecessary pressure....
When we are going to discuss that the NBA is losing its appeal every year, I can’t be the only one that almost doesn’t care
NBA season is a MARATHON and Skip wants to talk about events before that marathon. It's a minefield. Remember Minesweeper? Injuries are the mines. Lakers just need to be healthy in 6 months. Don't care what seed they get.
Before me watching this video I know that skip is goin got being up Russ leasing th league in turnovers 4 times and 4 times finishing in second in the last 8 years
Shannon now changing his tune about Westbrook 😂
It’s pre season. Y’all chill out Lebron about to get it together. Ain’t nothing but a little straightenin
Russ need to learn how to play off the ball or play off the bench. Him and LeBron don't mesh. He can run the second unit because LBJ need to run that 1st team offense.
When their starters were on they were winning. So I don’t see the big deal. When their bench players came on it’s a different story. Just sit back until the season begins
I had hopes for my Lakers after the Westbrook pick-up, even tho I FELT/BELIEVED it was a bad move. Now...this is the bad fit I thought it would be
Lebron played with the Tasmanian devil in space jam 2 now he has him on the lakers running point guard 😂😂😂🤣😄
I haven't seen a single preseason game. They're meaningless. Regular season is pretty meaningless. But Skip wants to harp about turnovers. Skip is a jinx and saying Lakers won't win it all means the opposite happens.
Gotta put Russ at the 2 like he should've always been
I will never get used to not having the highlights running while they talk about them
This is gonna be one entertaining season 😂😂😂🤣
Once again, Lebron needs more help 🤣🤣🤣
Frank vogal is the wrong coach
This reminds me of when lakers had Gary Payton Kobe Carl Malone and Shaq which ended in shambles. That’s why I wasn’t hyped
Lets have fate in them .is to Early to said  is only 5 games
I already saw the Kyrie video over 90 minutes ago. Hoang Zi helps me see the videos early without streaming it live. But the official upload needs to happen. Shannon made some good points but also ones for his liberal hypocrites.
why they do shannon like that in thumbnail
Deep down everyone knows Russ doesn’t fit 🤷‍♂️
Don’t let this distract you from the fact no Dallas Cowboys players media or staff have any respect for Skip Bayless.
Warriors in 5🥳
Westbrook is proving he's a overrated stat padder
I’ve been saying Russ needs to come off the bench as the 6th man. You have to have a spark off the bench, and that’s where he belongs.
All this about a Pre Season Game..LOL..
They need to be playing in the Big 3.
Ain’t it the preseason? RELAX😂
Is it mandatory as a Star laker to wear a dress Like Russ and Lebron you can't put a price on your MANHOOD or try to hide it by Calling it  Comedy trying to make people laugh. It's call being a sale out.
The problem with the Lakers is shooting. They don't have consistent shooters on this roster to help make it work. Until they realize this and fix it, the Lakers will continue to struggle.
Russ is hella overwhelmed to add to his already existing play style issues. hes happy to be playin for his Home & doesnt want to disappoint, while trying to prove critics wrong who say he doesn’t fit.
Wise words?.....from the biggest coward in basketball...from the guy who take every shortcut from steroids to blaming everyone ..stop it
Who cares? It's preseason. Let's keep talking about KYRIE, KYRIE, KYRIE. Skip talking about the most meaningless games. Everyone knows the Lakers won't get serious until April.
They can play together because they did in the Olympics. But they need to figure out how to limit turnovers and make free throws. The defense, intensity and rebounding is already at a championship level.
Reality kicks in. Retirement home gonna be battling for a spot in play offs.
Russ is a high risk, medium reward type of player... as good of a passer as russ is, he ain't as good as rondo or lebron.
The team defense was awful against the Warriors’ B team (no Steph, Klay, Wiseman, or Ballkicker)
Calm down. There's plenty of time to get the chemistry right. After playing 4 months together, they'll know how to play together.
it was easy to predict: - you have three ball-hogs -three players who arent moving without the ball -one who still thinks he plays in the hero-ball time -russell westbrick who still thinks that he can shoot and has low bb-iq -AND LBJ who still doesnt understand teambb This $hit will implode and i will love it.
But before it was all "we don't need to have 3s"😂😂😂😂 should have taken buddy hield
Westbrook is trying so hard. Be who you are make it easy for your self follow your heart. Just play your game that the main reason why LA wanted you. Slow down when you have a ball and calm down before passing the ball please
Lakers will be fine. I agree with Shannon, give them 30 games. Bigger takeaway from the preseason to me is, uhh, the Golden State Warriors are back.
Lakers need to snap out of their “pride” and get healthy before these other teams catch heat
Next 25 list (not in order)   1) Kobe 2) Duncan, 3) Lebron 4) Garnett 5) Iverson 6) Curry 7) Durant 8) Harden 9) D Howard 10) D Wilkins 11) R Miller 12) Bob Macadoo 13) Kidd 14) G Payton 15) T Mac 16) Dwade 17) CP3 18) Rodman 19) Dirk 20) Ray Allen 21) Kawhi 22) Nash 23) Westbrook 24) P Pierce 25) Giannis  I don't see AD and Melo making it the list
Lakers right now is reminding of that Cavs team built in 2017
We're talking bout pre-season.  Pre-season.
“I didn’t know I was here to be disrespected” - Sam Darnold
I could NEVER understand how the Lakers always get the benefit of being championship contenters just because of media coverage. There's about 7-9 teams that are better than the Lakers. I am not a Clippers fan, but they're are still a top 3 teams to win the champion.
Water pistol pete LOL NO YOU WILL NOT make it to the HOF woke or dreaming lol -J Rose voice
Lakers are trash!!!
Mark my words, russ will get injured if he is not able to play his game  There's nothing more dangerous then playing at 75% speed
Lol they really taking preseason that seriously 😂
Watch when the season starts  and Lakers start clicking everyone gonna say it's only regular season wait until playoffs
We still winning doe
Mark my words, russ will get injured if he is not able to play his game  There's nothing more dangerous then playing at 75% speed
That 6-0 point run by Lebron made him the best to ever do it!
If the offense is not going thru AD the Lakers r in trouble.......Splash Season returning 💦🏀, get miss out!
I don't know why they didn't trade Lonzo ball. Russ doesn't fit this team at all
LeBron to old to play with a slashing point he needa a playshot like kyrie
Westbrook either needs to be the 2 and have LeBron run the O - or - Russ gets his own unit off the bench to just keep energy alive when LeBron and AD are out. It only works with all three if Russ removes his head full of steam ego
Melo has matured in the way Russ could, and Melo should still start!
Russ breaking the record for turnovers in a preseason is a testament to where he’s at in his career ....that sounds like a record that’s held by javele McGee or Dwight Howard 😂😂😇
Claim "you're here within an Hour"
I’ve never seen people care so much about meaningless games
Melo is not a hall of fame player
Frank is the problem. He might have to go.
Before the season starts, I’d like to say this season will ruin Westbrooks career. He’s always played in small markets where his mistakes can be overlooked and overshadowed by big market teams. Now, he’s in the biggest market in the league so he will get eyes every night and the entire casual NBA fan base will recognize he is actually extremely inefficient especially as the game gets to the 4th quarter, particularly the last 6-8 minutes of the 4th quarter, Russell Westbrook becomes what i so aptly call him, “The Disease”.
He treats it like a football 😂 . Skip ownin sharpe these days
Can't wait to see them get smoked on Oct 19 vs the Warriors.....AGAIN. Skip's gonna get a lot of cases this season
Melo and ad are not hall of famers. Let’s cut the bs
The lakers look awful. It reminds me of  when cavs had Wade and drose. Westbrook just doesn't fit in 🤷🏾‍♂️
Lmfao this happens every year a new super team is formed. Overreaction by the fans and media. The Lakers will be fine as long as they are healthy and it’s that simple
See how they manipulate the stat sheet for LeBron.  This is preseason so just imagine how they manipulated during the regular season and playoffs. That's why I tell LeBron fans I don't want to hear anything about no statistics.
Impossible to dribble a football? Most Aussie lads can do that by the age of 8
I would’ve just loved this team so much more if we traded for Buddy Hield AND Demar DeRozen which was the plan initially. I’m not panicking but I didn’t like the move to start with , but I was just much more comfortable with Bron running point guard at this stage of his career.
Russ for Kyrie
Its preseason 😂😂😂
Second round exit.
Why don’t they show the clips like in the show?
Pre-season may not count but it definitely highlights key areas. The Lakers have a lot of work to do. They've looked horrible in all their preseason games.
Watching this game I realized something...Russ gotta play off ball !!! He gotta go post and work from there !!....he has that baseline post and spin off for the layup or foul but him coming down the court making decisions is a disaster of a season waiting to happen 🤣🤣
The Turnover Bros
They probably will struggle since the whole team is basically new but I wouldn't overreact for a pre-season game
First play the big 3 out there.... Westbrook throws the ball away and that's because Golden State was 3 for 20 from the 3 in the first half!
Who gives a dam about preseason. Y’all make it seem like this is the nba finals give it a rest😂
GET EM SKIP
That look like a Sam darnold pass 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 skip funny for that
I know it’s early but going by what I seen...Brooklyn or the lakers don’t look like they can beat Milwaukee....Milwaukee looked vicious In preseason sheesh !!!!
How abt we start Russ for 2-3 minutes then rondo plays for awhile and russ could lead the 2 nd unit?
If u ain’t learned yet… NEVER COUNT LEBRON OUT, comin frm a Steph fan
Where the heck is the shooting coming from for LA ?
This is who Russell always been and people expect him to change??? You got to take the good with the bad, he always been a turnover machine, his shot is horrible and if he dosent have the ball in his hands what can he do? He dosent even move that well without the ball and considering he is a liability shooting, they will close the lane which will make it harder for Bron to play his game
How can Skip blame Russ for LeBron's turnover rates, when LeBron is number 1 in turnovers all time smh
Second round exit
these oldies team will not go anywhere soon . lol
Did Shannon give them a 3 like he gives the cowboys every week? 😂
Skip: even I can make basketball hall of fame.  Skip: average 1 pt per game in high school.
Kent can’t play lick of defense . LEBRON choose not to play defense last night !!!
I wouldn't worry about the pre season
NBA HOF is a joke. They let everyone in…  I just seen  Vlade Divac was in the HOF..
I’ve never seen preseason basketball get so much attention 😂 I’ll check in on Christmas
Water Pistol Pete JR to the HOF
Russ is awful
It’s the PRESEASON. Everyone on the Lakers is just throwing around flashy passes having a fun time, chill tf out!
So lebrons turnovers didn't warrant more criticism even though he had one more.
All 4 on the floor and still lost, because Lakers bad signing of Westbrook and no one wants to say it!
It's not going to work for the lakers lebron needed a shooter no russ
Why wasn't this worked out in practice.
It won't work. No coherent philosophy or scheme. Russ is incapable of playing in a new manner. He won't be able to adjust.
Told Y'all Russ Will Cost Y'all...Better Ask KD About Him...There Is A Reason People Say They Can't Win With Him....My Netz With Or Without Kyrie Would Embarrass The Lakers....And If Ky Comes Back We Will Sweep The Lakers In The Finals...IF THE LAKERS MAKE IT THERE... BECAUSE KLAY THOMPSON WILL BE BACK...AND THERE GOES THE LAKERS SHOT A THE TITLE.
Even when the Lakers had the 1 seed and won it all it wasn’t enough from Skip and the haters so what else is new lol.
When LeBron figures out how to make it work and how each piece will fit together to make a contending team, I want to hear nothing. Not a peep from the people who doubted his greatest asset, his iq.
Hmmmm Shannon looks worried! Behind his eyes 👀
Old team and bad fit. They will making it on talent for a while but I dont know if they're built for a deep playoff run.
Westbrook be pissing me off bruhhh just calm down , you don’t have to pass 0.5 seconds after getting a rebound!
I’m convinced that any team with lebron on it tries to lose preseason games on purpose. They’ll be better as the regular season goes on
Producers should cut to the game footage that Skip goes over
It's to early to tell of they will be good or not. I say we give them at least til after Christmas
LJ and AD will need 50 gm.s each on vacation to have any chance of being healthy in the post season. Without both of them playing the Lakers are average or below. They'll be lucky to make the 8th spot if LJ and AD dont play every game. Good luck with that.
No Curry no Klay no Draymond, Warriors looks really good last night
It's definitely going to take a while, Russ looks lost right now but we'll see what happens in a few months from now.
Lol imagine if they won. It wouldn’t be “just preseason” like it is now
loool Skip was  right
Skiup: What a Baloonie?!  Unc Shay: *SPEECHLESS
Gotta stay patient guys. Let the haters talk. I’ll remember these times and when they win it all those same people that’re saying “washed” “3 60 year olds” and “retirement home” will then say “It’s a super team” so there’s really no way of winning. Just gotta let it happen
Popular Opinion: Every single one of y'all agrees this is an embarassment made our Day:
Lakers lost to the bench lmao imagine when curry Thompson and green hit the floor lmfao "consider this a warning" 🤣🤣🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
The Lakers have to play fast! LeBron has to become a scorer.. only being affective when you have the ball in your hand is not going to work on this team...Russ can be his best self when he is play making and pushing the ball...Lebron is his best self when he has the ball in his hands controlling the pace. If LeBron is the "Greatest" (not) basketball player ever he has to be able to adjust his game to make "lesser" players their most effective self. If LeBron is cannot make that adjustment, the team will ultimately struggle and everyone will blame Russell Westbrook
I said it before: the only way that I can see LeBron and Russ fitting together is if one of them moves to the bench. Other than that, I can't see it.
Jordan Poole got next
Russ treats the basketball like a football...lol...thats accurate tho..lol
Despite being a graveyard team this team also has no 3pt shooters
Russ belongs nowhere
I bet if the Lakers were winning these games all these Lakers fans wouldn’t use that “It’s the preseason” excuse
I mean you have two dynamic ball dominant players. Why not have different personnel go out with lebron/ russel
dude i don’t understand the “poole looks like jordan clarkson” comparisons. he looks like steph out there with his shooting off the dribble and screens. he’s moving so much off ball too. you can tell steph taught this kid well.
LeShannon back tracking already 😂🤣
Caruso was a better player for this team than Russel Westbrook. When LeBron has the ball in his hands, WB becomes worse than useless as they stop guarding him to double team others.
Damn how about talk just a little bit of how the warriors are looking.
It's like having two quarterbacks on the field. One is a better quarterback but what they both do well only one is a little better at which is shooting.
Skip: I could make it into the hall of fame because of their low standards Also Skip: Averages 1.4 pts a game for college career
How do you messure who's has the best basketball IQ then?
Like Firehouse Subs!
It's the preseason to quote Aaron Rodgers  R-E-L-A-X!!!
it's called the lebum effect !! 😂
Skip was sitting back rubbing his hands like birdman last night lol
Skip is all HAPPY right now cuz the Lakers aren’t looking good and the Cowboys are doing real good right now in football lol  But we will see who has the last laugh 😂
I'm surprised Shannon showed up today after that bulljive play from the Lakers last night 😂
And what is Buddy Hield doing?
Since when we take preseason seriously??
Be patient people it’s going to take until mid December for them get it
It’s not gonna work with Westbrook watch..
Russell is gonna be the excuse why LeBron didn't get a ring this year smh
They some old as cats that can win for s***
It's the preseason so you should expect mistakes
Lakers suck!!!   Hahahaha
Warriors B squad made Russ useless by sagging off him from the 3 point line and  double teaming the other players. Lakers have no answer just like the Rockets.
The amount of money I would pay to see skip & lebron have a sit down convo is insane
360 🌡
Why are ppl worried about the Lakers preseason lol Everything will be good once the playoffs get here!!
It's going to be interesting to see how the ball gets moved around with all these big names... I think Melo has conceded to the fact he's no longer the young version of himself... Westbrook doesn't understand that concept
The only person that showed up last night was Lebron
This team isn't built for the regular season, neither for the Playoffs. It's built for 2013.
I can see it already, Lebron and Westbrook game 1 playoffs is gonna be Lebron and J.R Smith game 1 playoffs 🤣
Yea it's preseason but no way Warriors lineup against the Lakers' should have won "Lakers led at the half" - 2 point lead when Warriors only starter to play was Wiggins
This week has not been good to Shannon 😂😂
NETS IN 6 btw
The Lakers are going to make Skip look like a genius 😅
I’m surprised I’m this early 😂 but it’s just preseason I don’t really pay attention till playoffs and if my teams in or not
Why are people overreacting over a damn pre season? The Lakers will get it together. Chill out already. Geez. Smfh 🤦🏾‍♂️
I’m not trying to be that guy who complains about them constantly talking about the Lakers, Tom Brady and the Cowboys, but I am starting to think those 3 topics fill the gap they need to complete the show.
Don't get discouraged, we got this!
The lakers "Big 3" Is POOP
We really at the point where preseason games get media attention…lbj has to be the goat
I hope they don't put Westbrick in the NBA Top 75.
🤡🤡🤡
Okay
😂😂😂😂 a fire drill!!
Russ top 38. Ad top 24. Lebron top 7.
First
It’s really nothing to worry about. But let make it a topic anyway
This week is no good for uncle sharpe! 🤣
