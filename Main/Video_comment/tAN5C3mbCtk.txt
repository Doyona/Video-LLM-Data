Parents: "He can't spend it all, can he?" Kid: "So anyways I started spending"
Fr
Gen z parents showing their children that they can buy 1 skin
Prioritize skins i leave the sucky ones and pick up the rare ones
EVERYONE ON TWITTER HAS THIS ONE had me cackling bro😭
Old fortnite>>
Bro, I can never get vbux can someone give me a cold?
My parents were right
And the thing is, the child is gonna use these skins like a few times, then let them sit in the locker for the rest of time.
i have not play fortnite in 3-4 yrs im hop on it
We have cancel purchases
“You’re not a sweat! You’re never going to use that!”  “Buhga bought this one!”

If I was a parent I'd just be like "You can spend it all this season if you want, I'm still not buying you V bucks until the next 3 seasons".  It'll make u have smarter decision making skills.

Meanwhile me trying to save for the new battle pass because i like 3 specific skins and i just want to have it as a OG chapter 2 season 2 player:
what i see: *buying stuff in fortnite* what my mum see's (im serious): *THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY*
Sped all of you’re v bucks and get more v bucks if you are hare 1:15
* he can’t spend it all * what are u worried about, it’s vbux, not ur money, it’s not like he’s actively buying more vbux
i don’t understand
Youuuuutube
0:49 my main skin :/ don’t dis. It :c
And imagine there's way cooler skins the next season
anyways the money has been spent on vbucks then why they worry about buying
I remember kobe buy everything skins
SLUSHY SOLDIER ON TOP
Why does the parent care so much they already bought the vbucks it’s not like their losing anymore money
Why don’t you uplaod anyone more pls upload more
I started this game after I moved out of my parents house. It took me two years before I bought a second skin (outside of battle passes) and I rarely use any of the ones I have now. I think I have almost every marvel skin, those are the only ones I religiously buy 😅
u brang me back nostalgia from watching your videos
Spent 100 dollars on a skit, 7.6k profit 😂
Me when I see dragon ball skins
he forgot about the battlepass
The yes in the end
i made a list off all the jam tracks i wanted recently, found out id need $90 JUST for the tracks
He doesn’t even support himself
Me with no vbucs and no skin
Bro needs spider man

This is the equivalent of “just one more game”💀
Just buy  the battle pass
4 year Olds on fortnite in a nutshell 😂

Back when item shops didnt sell lego sets

“ you’re never going to use them after December“   Me using ice nog ops in march😔
I gotta get the grimbles
Man your parents monitored what you buyer I just got what I want whenever I wanted
To think all that could be avoided with a cheap condom.  lronic isn't it?
Average college student
This is my actual inner-monologue, both the adult and the manchild arguing in my head.
Wait lol why did YouTube comment 😂

He ignored nog ops 💀
bro picked the ugliest skins ever
Everybody add me username is Mo salah11
I respect how he spent 13,900 vbucks for this video👍
@youtube get a life
The fact that he wasted 13900 v bucks just for a skit is insane (and he didn’t buy the Nog Ops skin as well)
This so relatable
I got this recomended in 2024 🤡🤡
Au moins il a pris le skin de zetfar

Wow that was funny
Yesss the first skin he bought was my main😆
I almost never have 0 vbucks it’s usually 10 or 40
I never would've thought I'd see a comment from the OFFICIAL YouTube channel.

Plot Twist:His father whooped him after that.

At the end when he said “ YES” cracked me up
I don't use money on the game
And Hinata
Some times I wish I had ruby cause I have boardwalk ruby
This man spent his own vbucks for a skit and nearly bought the entire item shop respect
Youtube commented😦
Lol
OH I DIDNT SEE THE GRIMBLES I GOTTA GET THE GRIMBLES I GOTTA GET THE GRIMBLE
Parent:that's enough slices!  Child: more slices!
“Your not gonna use it after December” I felt that
This is very accurate
this is my brother whenever he gets v bucks
And this was the beginning of Kobe’s Spending every single V-Buck on skins
youtube commented becuz youtube is a fortnite sweaty tryhard                                                                                                              pls dont ban my yt account
I have that feeling when I have v bucks😂
The kid:omg beach bomber buys realizes he has no more v bucks
This is so funny 🤣🤣😅😃😎
the fact that this video is the polar opposite of what parents do
you idiots pay money for items with no competitive advantage geez at least tf2 actullay gives you stuff
Pov: the official YouTube channel comments on your video
Bro spent 13500 vbicks in less than a min
The funny thing is tha  you use like 3 different skins when you have a bunch of them.
ive been paralyzed for years un able to walk and this video gave me the motivation to get out of my wheel chair and fling my myself of a 13 story building to my death
is that... YouTube?
I can only imagine the pain while he made this video
Thats actually sad
Like the vid for him spending 100$ for inertanment
Wow. Maturity anyone?
lol cheezeburger
Bro is he just buying them because other people have it???
Dude just spent 100 dollars for a 1 minute skit
Dad: Are you flipping serious son
Parents shouldn’t care cuz the child already has a lot of vbucks
This is literally me with marvel/gaming skins, and I am 16.
I didn’t know there were more than three skins in the item shop at a time ahhh
Bro also bought the gamer girl skins
how my mom is when she sees the item shop  Mom: don't you want this skin or this one they look cool  Me: No mom they don't interest me
This is my brother.
that would be me.              if i had enough vbucks...
The beighstowm bomber lol
Looks at his v-bucks him having 13,900 then I look at my v-bucks and I only have 100 just deletes fortnite
This is pretty stupid. It's called disciplining  your child.
Me: (as a parent): buys my son Marvel/DC gear & grinds to max TWO battle pass accounts so he’ll have extra skins.. while he only ever plays as gold midas. 😓
That is true
OMG YOUTUBE IS THAT REALLY YOU LIKE THE CEO OF YOUTUBE😱😱😱😱
Yup
Good grief these kids....
Dont scroll                                 i warned you                    Never gonna give you up
an absolute Devil child
buy me a skin bro XD (not kidding XD)
Then the shop refreshes and you see the skin you've been waiting months for
For a minute i was like what? The  i was like Okay i get it parnets look at it and children just buy it becuase its there 🤤💅🏼
I only have three skins lol
He’s gonna be asking for more
they really dont care how much vbucks you spend its how much money they spend
fortnite
Bro just spent 150 dollars in 1 minute for a game with his parents credit card woe
yo why didnt he pin yt
Wow, it hurt to see that 13,500 go to zero in less than 3 minutes.
So true lol
My kid on my account like
POV: ur parents also watch and play fortnite.
Me:
Ayo that kid got some problems
when your an adult and your both at the same time
wenegade waider
Just spent $100 in one minute lmao
He just wanted a really dumb excuse to waste his money on Fortnite
You know your video is worthy of views when YouTube comments on it.

Literally my little brother... When ever he get v bucks he will just buy the whole entire item shop. LIKE BRO YOUR NOW EVEN GOING TO USE THE SKINS AFTER TODAY 🥲
Bro this is 100% true. I had a friend who was about 10 or 8 years old back then and for Christmas or Birthday they got 100 dollars worth of Vbucks.  And they spend it all on that one item shop. I was so confused 🤣
Lol
You got all the skins
Bro-
If its like that i would rather get the battle pass then wait for a good skin
This man managed to spend 13,000 chicks in 1:14 minutes

Bruh you literally wasted your bucks..
pov how to show off your skin buying session....  no offence
Me: (thinks it’s a lot spending 5000 vbucks) kobes: (spends 13500 vbucks in one minute)
More like the child buys just 1 skin, but the parent just sees a bunch of 13,500 vbucks
This is kinda true
child man
how about the realization when the kid hears from the parent he will get no more vbucks
You got him the best vbuck pack let him spend it?!?
This is relaitable to me... only reason why i have 4cp in codm 😐😶
I like these videos, keep pushin bro.
nahhe just bought everything from the item shop
My brother is one of those kids that buys a skin just because a popular streamer or YouTuber owns it and then never actually uses the skin.
My guy spend that much on a bride storm bomber when u could get the pickaxe and skin and back pack for 1,200 v bucks and he spent 1,500 when all he had to do was get bundle wooowwwww.
Yea I wish i had that type of vbuck and I'd have those skins
This is literally me, and i'm an adult. 😅
My man got grimbles
R u a parent with this problem? Next time use condoms

the kid at the end be like: LETS GOOOO
THE BUNDLE WAS 400?
Rip your vbucks
Everyone on twitter has this one💀
Youtube commeted
bugah got this one i got to get this one lmao 😂 man that was funny 😂
They’re gonna great at money management when they are adults.
The fact that you. Spend v bucks well appreciated
I wish I had that many v-bucks
I dont know what comedy is no more
This guy just buys every skin he probably doesnt like from the shop for a video

IHYF
Bro like why do you need this much skins
Bro YouTube joined 52 years ago don’t believe me click on their account pic
Lol the voice
Why is this true!😂
if only my parents had that money
He sounds sped
The  voice...
Wait the kid just bought a skin for 1500 when he could buy the skin and pickaxe in a bundle for 400 like wt*
R.I.P V-Bucks
🤣🤣🤣🤣Lol
Kobe you forgot to put your creator code lol
rip your vbucks you might not see this but rip you vbucks for this good vid :)
XD
Thst I you for spending all your Vbucks for our entertainment
3 of my fav skins in that item shop, Sunbird, Ruby, Britestorm Bomber lol
cringe
I’m here
I mean, how much could some skins in a game cost? It’s just one game, let him get what he wants.
lmao
Parent: well there gos my bank account savings
I don't even have 1 item shop skin yet sed lifee 😑😖😭
The "YESHHH" at the end after wasting all the vbucks 😂😂
The "des" at the end hits different
So relatable. I usually get some vbucks to get something I need and then save the rest for something later. Obviously they are all gone in seconds
Too cringey
He spent $80 on just dis vid lol
"Everyone on twitter uses this one!" We all know why 😂
yo brgt te wole item sop
Cringe
Sometimes You gotta do what you gotta do
britestrom bomber 1:10
“THE BWIGHT STORM BOMER.” that cracked me up 🤣
No way YOUTUBE HERE
D
The brightstorm BOmEr
Lol!
I am the opposite. Instead of asking my parents to buy me skins, I grinded to get them for free.
True
when 0 v bucks like me
The child is not using any support a creator code
if you're kid is using twitter and that age you failed as a parent
You spent over 13,900 V-BUCKS while I have 0 V-BUCKS can you gift me the battle pass, my username is SniperLegend_25
What's up Broski 🦋!
Nooo
bro just get the belt
i bet he got grown ppl feeling like theyre old
This is just my opinion but a lot of stuff on the item shop is overpriced
The way he said bright storm bomber tho was halaraus ingnore me spelling
my guy wasting all his money for a video
i actually did this when i was a kid oh god (but with different skins
"Everyone on Twitter has this skin" Whatchu mean by that lol
this was posted on my bday lol
THAT YES😆
when he said that in 1:13 i was like xDDDD
Kids will literally waste all of their v bucks as soon as they get it
It's always a hard decision when if there's a cool skin you want to get from the shop now or save it for some other skin or bundle down the line.
This hurts me in da heart
Did nobody notice youtube comment on this video?
respect for spending 80 dollars for a 1 minute vid
Every day i buy the entire item shop. And by entire, i mean entire. I have over 200k vbucks so that's how i do it.
Is every parent like that on their kids?
I would kick the child out the window, if I had a child I wouldn't want them to have a mental illness. So I would just act like fortnite never existed.
Dis ones a ssssteal lol
the only thing you missed from the parent one is instead of seeing vbucks they see dollars signs lol
I have the ice bundle
My guy spent 80 dollars on vbucks to make this video O~O
*when the battle pass has 10 skins but costs 700 less vbucks
at 0:51 why did someone say cabbie
Parent: *gives child credit card*  Child: YEAAAAA BOIIII  credit card: "kill me now plss"
Me finkin that he said schooll trooper
the best/worst of vbucks spent XD
1.6 Million People have been Rick Rolled in this Video so far
Man bought the whole item shop😂😂😂😂
This is my mind who wants the skins vs my mind who knows I’m spending way too much money on this game! 😂
Just don't buy him anymore v bucks 👁️👄👁️

Big brain people: buy battle pass you grind and get free vbucks and get the next battle pass for free
1:13
This kid sucsefully pissed me off
This is so funny 🤣
He deserves a like he wasted 100 bucks on for fortnite

Da Bwight Stome Bomma
1,592,852 views are enough to replenish the vbucks
When the kid said this is the funniest emote when buying never gonna, I was the same way with rambunctious and infectious
Replace the Fortnite skins with Steam games on sale. Same story for me. 😂👌
Am like the only girl who doesn't have a ruby skin
What’s wrong with buying Yule Trooper? Some people do wear holiday skins after the specific month for that holiday
How is it possible that YouTube joined 52 years ago?
Deess

The fact that he spent 13,900 vbucks for a video is pure dedicatation
Me with robux:

“He can’t spend it all can he?” Child: *you underestimate my power*

that cost... more than a hundred bucks... ur sane dude
This is true
He really bought grimbles
This was a spending spree video in disquies
Wait..... Who payed at least 100$ dollars worth of Vbucks for this kid....
Too easy
I thought it'd be  Child: *Buys skin and sees skin* Parent: *Watches child throw money in fire
😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
Wow
Wow YouTube???
This video is stupid and makes no sense i disliked it’s sooo bad my god doesn’t deserve the views blechhh
YouTube watching Fortnite shorts🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨I just can’t believe it hi YouTube by the way😲😮😮😮
Guy spent nearly $100 for a minute and a half vid. Just remember guys whenever you feel useless just remember this guy.
Who buys grimbles
Kids be like:
Any time there’s a new bundle “dude I had to get it I would be wasting money if I didn’t “
Welp you have 13k VBUCKS.
That's me I do that
This was made on my birthday
The parent got him 100 dollars of Vbucks and he still has a baby accent. What did she expect?
spent $100 on fortnite vbucks just for a skit...💀
omg i have to grow my ego
100% funny
Okayyyyyyyy

I dont get it
ayo? what he know bout twitter
That is the worst voice so cringe
Today I bought 3 things from the shop. Now I have 50 vbucks, but it was worth it. My friend is going threw something tough and wanted to help her out. 🥺
i remember this guy from his rating skins videos
Roses are red violets are blue we gave him a view
Every kid
Did YouTube just comment on this video
That’s a lot of fun 🤩
Bro ur just old like parents are elders and child is teen
I talk be like:
Youtube got bored too😅 merry christmas🤣
Thats my dream
why grimbles?
Lmao only a Fortnite parent would say his kid isn't a sweat.
I love when he said bugha has dis one
It’s surprising how realistic it is
Why does that kid trigger me for some reason
My parents be like: NO STARTER BUNDLE U CRAZY OR WHAT??
Fatherless behaviour
I'd actually suggest the one who looks like a nutcracker.he has 5 variations all together.
Relatable 🤣🤣
Man sacrificed his vbucks for this video. Can we get an f in the chat
"But Bugha has this one I gotta get this one”
MY GOD I MIsSED RUBY RUBY noooooo    Me rly wanted that skin lol     Also me *cries in no vbucks*
Jesus Christ that's like $50 holy cow no one's parents would actually do that
He spent a lot of money in this video 💸
Bugha got this one i gotta get too basically the whole fortnite what is tryhard what isnt thats how people decide if a skin is good or not if a streamer has it 💀
yt WHAT WEIRD SEEING YOU HERE?
He buyed some trash skins… my eyes hurt I subscribed for your rip v bucks
This is when you tell the child to stop for real if they don't listen slap them
I even feel the pain
I like the ruby part
Parents: no your not a sweat me: but he can be one 1 day...:)
If v-bucks was the American currency the parents bank account would be BROKE
and then he regrets buying 90% of the skins and begs mommy for more 3 days later. no wonder they never get you vbucks
how u spend thousnds of vbucks in less than a minute 😂
Me: had 13.5K bucks   Also me:, gifted to friends and subs and only baught a few emotes for myself with 1 skin
Haha, thats the fun part: My parents don't give me money to buy skins. They don't know that I have Fortnite, oh yeah
I used your code
YouTube joined 51 years ago 💀
Cringe
10year olds, take some notes
Too easy
And is see now that can buy for the refer challenges you can buy the skin
Damn ur rich 😂😂
Parents:You can get one skin only one! Child: *Buys the whole item shop*

My favorites is when they lie about the purchases after you earned the money on SAVE THE WORLD.
Somrre timeses you sound like THATS ENOUGH SLICES
That's funny 😂

0:43 He's right though😅
Ngl the frosty legends drift gear legitimately looks amazing

Thousand comments

If i was the parent i would be like: that's it you are never playing this ever again. And then I'll started playing in his acc😂🤙
The YESH at the end is the best lolllll
Oh my god exactly what we do
Too easy
“I gotta get dish one”
ehh hello youtube
I just felt the life fly away from the childs parent omg😂😂😂😂😂😂😑
BUGAH HAS IT, THEREFOR I NEED IT
i used your code
The vid ended cause his dad plugged the console out😂
SO TRUE 😂😂🙂
Lol the owner commented
The fact that youtube commented on this makes this video recommended to everything
Pain
That basicly me when I say I'm gonna save my v-bucks but then I lie
“but bugha got this one”😂😂😂😂
Love how you worked out the right way to spend every single one with nothing left over. Would have been nice if it was all in 1 day.
So are we just gonna ignore the fact that we got Rick Rolled
facts
He got the 1500 vbucks britestorm bomber when there was a pack that was for 400 vbuck lol
Bro I had slingshot before bugha I had since season X
😑😑😑😑
LOL
Shout out to this guy for wasting his money for our entertainment
This is so funny🤣🤣
Nah it be like...   Children: cool skin Parents: one hundred dollars
this kid just spent £100 worth of vbucks in like 2 minutes
Can't watch it, too much pain :")
That's why you put a password on your account
There’s a Rick roll soooo Never Gonna Give You Up
The parents are gonna let them buy the whole shop they’re going to wonder why they’re broke LOL
THIS VIDEO HAS : 581 DISLIKE  •I’LL UPDATE THE NUMBER EVERY TIME SOMEONE NEW SUBSCRIBES
That was happened when math goes.
How to spent 13.000 vbucks in one minute
Me still spoiling my inner child.
I don’t get it, I couldn’t hear the audio because it’s loud where I am, was the audio needed?
Looool

My sister gifted my the skull trooper last year!
he's got lucky bc he now has my most favorite fortnite skin, ruby
Dang he spend a lot :0

But the full battlepass °_°
Half of the stuff you bought there was no SAC being used😭
Lmaoooo 🤣🤣🤣
“The bwightstom bombah”
i bougth the brite storm bomber.... wost mistake of my life
I imagine him thinking : My son has low standards
he spent 120 aud for a skit, this deserves a sub
I love how he did a shameless plug in the start
imagine dis man forgot to record💀
and I appreciate the fact that he spent all of his buck for content
I'm just sad that a child buys a sweat skin cause he thinks he'd be sweaty 👁👄👁
why do some parents choose what they can or can't get with vbucks
mrbeast as a kid: I JUST BOUGHT THIS WHOLE ENTIRE ITEMSHOP!
He used 18,900 vbucks and I don't even have the battle pass
I thought at the end he was gonna say “well I have no v-bucks……cAn I pWeAsE gEt mOrE v-BuCkS………?”
100% true
Dassss
The fact that he calculated the amount of skins he can buy with that amount of vbucks is so cool.
Ayo why js the child using Twitter 🤨
He then realised that the bundle was 400 b bucks and the child was never Seen again
when he said “everyone on twitter has one” in a 5 year old voice i died
Alternative title: spending 13900 in one minute
Imagine if he realized he didn't click record.
THIS VIDEO HAS TO DO WELL he spent so much money I have respect for you
Loll
lol
You already bought the vbucks why are you tweaking
YOUTUBE HAS HAD THEIR ACCOUNT FOR 51years???????????
Then ask for more vbucks
Okay I understand frozen legends though its amazong
cant we just appreciate how he spent all the vbucks and had 0 left?
Moment of silence for the kids who spent a lot of money on thier account and gets banned
Pls gift arda_aslan127
Lol
That's more like your older sibling who played before you
$100 down the drain 😢
But not the battle pass
The views gave you back your vbucks
l o l
That's enough slices
So facts
You bought almost the whole item shop for a skit 😂
Ain’t no way this man spent 100 dollars for a skit u earned a sub man
13k vbucks spent in 1:15 minutes lol...
faxz
I gatta get this one, no on don't get the bundle! 🤣

You wasted all your vbucks for this video
True ajajjja😭😢😒😂
😆😆😆
It’s like the universe knows I’m about to get vbucks
He just spent 75 bucks for a few seconds of content
I have a friend like this then he begs me to gift him and when I say no he’s like  You’re mean  You’re never nice to me You never gift me
Your not even using the code
Lol this is so funny
He didn't actually use a code
Dad? Can I have some more?!!!?
That’s a lot of v-bucks
missing ending: Kobe uses all his v-bucks then renegade raider comes out for a limited time
Gift me

I feel bad for him he spent so much v bucks for a skit
what are you doing
Lol bruh my mom just gave m money and says spend it on whatever you want
Yes
Bruh my parents didn't even buy me games
My friend's little brother once got the most expensive vbucks option for his birthday, him being a dumb child immediately bought everything in the item shop, and that shop had some real stinkers. I wasn't there when it happened but I imagine it can't have been much different from this lol
Why u using no creator code during buying 😂😂😂lmao lol 😂
“He can’t spend it all” *continues to spend it all
Lol I Love The Child Voice You Put On
No one gonna talk about how he ended with straight up 0 v-bucks left?
All that money for a vid well done
im dying inside :(
The fact that he used 13900 vbucks just to make this vid😉Keep it up!
I pray that he didn’t get beat🙏
R.I.P Kobe's bank account and vbucks
It’s me when I play. Accept I don’t have vbucks. But I would be like that
I love your conten
When the kid finds out It’s Black Friday
*13000 vbucks*
Des I love it

true dedication he bought ugly skins for a video
0:05 He buys Slushy Soldier and the other stuff with creater code: NONE ????
no one is laughing
U shouldn't waste all ur vb for these items tho
He supported his own code trying to be funny He is at a very low level of funny
LOL
Lol
Britestorm bomber it's my fafourite skin in fortnite

Respect to Kobes he wasted $80 for a vid

Rip his vbucks ayyyyyy
This guy sacrificed all his vbucks for this video.
This parenting is horrible 🤣
The fact that this kid said “everyone on Twitter has this one” concerns me he is like 7 sounding
Kinda cringe ngl
This is the average switch player
No last night all my dad saw was 25 levels and he just really wants to see his son play as spiderman and he also cranked my brother to think I grinder level 42 but he just bought it and my brother at 31
can we all respect this guy for spending $100 on this short video...
i mean he atlest got a lot of cool skins
Kobes child voice is so funny

*Atleast there is a refund system so the parent can just hack on then get all the vbucks back*
That's a lie. I know how to manage myself spending on videogames after ALL these years living with my parents! :) I still think I'm leaving the house at 31.
Only two things my parents would never buy me v bucks... and why did the parent not want him to buy use v bucks
Can u plz make videos like this
:0 Kobes ur on trending!! Also whenever i show my mom some of the skins i get she gets disappointed that i spent money on that. She doesnt think fabio sparklemane is worth the money 🥲

Kobe I have a challenge 4 u. Try to get a full inventory of MK foundation mythic and win the game. This is by killing the boss, and putting his mythic in a tent. You'll also need someone else to help as if you do it in solos, you would only be able to get 4 from killing the foundation and the max 3 in your tent. Goodluck!
haha liked this one 😂😂

This was really funny 😂
He's so lucky I don't even have a skin

Quite accurate since he bought all the skins that literal children use 😭
I like how at the end he was all excited and he was like”BRO THE BWITESHTWORM BOWMER?! Das-“ and then notices he spent all his Vbucks
video idea: can you take fire damage while healing inside a tent?
That is so me
I’m wondering where he got the vbucks
