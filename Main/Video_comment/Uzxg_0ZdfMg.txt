I have a theory Liverpool threw this game and the fa Cup one as well
UNITED UNITED UNITED
2:12
1:17
Never a pen
Quansh mistake
Damn
Controversial game at Old Trafford! | Manchester United 2-2 Liverpool | Premier League Highlights
Twice liverpool needed pens to draw with a poor united side 😂
Loved how loud the atmosphere was when bruno scored
crazy games
Times when Onana was underated
Neville is an absolute disgrace
Fernandes scored a sick goal
WHAT A GAME! 🤯 | Manchester United 2-2 Liverpool | Premier League Highlights
Salah  scored
The day Quansah was playing for Man Utd
bruno rat
Mainoo goal reminds me of Federico Macheda against Aston Villa
Who else is here after the 2-2 draw at anfield
United got absolutely spanked that game. Quansah the std seeker gave the game away
Lobbies AMAZING turn😱
Elliott the rat diving
what a goal from minion
That goal from bruno is BEYOND INCREDIBLE
I believe l can fly
Solid point towards 3rd for Liverpool
At 1:15 u can hear a player saying Hey Quansah
I was there
BRUNOOOOO!!!!!!    WHAT A COAL!!! ,,,
Anyone here where we battered them 3-0 in there stadium 💀
The way he said Fernandes just gives chills
Kelly  kobbie is soo bad    Kobbie are you sure
Liverpooop
I am a city fan but Bruno’s goal 👌
Riley
that goal was class😀
Who here in 2078?
Still never a pen btw
Can we have Gary and Carra as pundits on every United vs Liverpool game? Their reactions are gold.
L
Liverpool should of beaten us 6-1 despite quansah mistake
“Uhhuoghh” - does that in other matches lol
most beutfial goal ive seen by mainoo
hit by FERNANDESSSSS!!!!!
unpopular opinion fernandes should win puskas
Never a pen
I feel like the guy who whistles to put opposition off when opponents are getting towards uniteds goal has been doing it forever, im 42 by the way 😂.
What’s a good match?
Nahh, kobbie manioo goal was 🥶 cold
The game which ended Liverpools season
Amazing shot from Bruno Vanandez ❤😂😊
For a complete shambolic write off for a season its been worth it just for the emergence of Mainoo and the accelerated improvement of Garnacho
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who likes Mo salah
Mo salah Mo salah  Mo salah
dodge it and be careful and get the 1
That wasnt a pen. Robbed of 3 points
nice
Imagine coventry won 4-3 i want bizarc even ddo i support liverpool yntil i hurd it was offside
2:01 2:05 2:05 2:06 2:06
So wasn't a Penalty Liverpool cheating again!!
😂🎉
NANANANA LIVERPOOL IN THE MUD IN THE MUD, LIVERPOOL IN THE MUD
Wasted opportunity
We love the scripted football we do! Oh scripted football we love you! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You can see ginge in the back of salahs pen
Great
Can we please appreciate Mainoo’s goal? That should get goal of the month.
Jamie Carragher need to go to specsavers and watch Onana's goalkeeper performances. Saying he has been in good form in the last few months is total rubbish he is the worst goalkeeper Man Utd have had this season.
Come on Manchester United🔴
There was something very Scholes-esque about Mainoo’s goal. Pure technique. Beautiful to watch.
That goal that Fernandez did amazed me man
I’m a city fan but Liverpool are clear of united 7-0 ,5-0,4-0,4-2,2-0,3-1 so many big score lines Man U get battered every where they go plus 6th equal united
I'm sorry - just howling at that fernadez goal - and tha mainoo one - just WOW
Manio is just so amazing 🤩
That dive by Harvey Elliot 😂
funny that all Liverpool fans in the comments go on about that 7:0 game like it’s the best thing they’ve ever achieved also waiting to hear what trophy that you won for that game 😂
Fixed
Man United should feel privileged to have competed against a truly special, special football club
Amazing games
Man.   I.    Team
2:45
I hope Liverpool win the premier league because my  grandfather Vic Wright (on wiki) played for them in  1930s.  In Liverpool's defence was Sir Matt Busby.   But more importantly though = seriously - they used to drink 9 pints of beer  in the 1930s before they went onto the pitch lol.  Can you image them drinking 9 pints of Stella now:  the stretchers would be carrying them onto the pitch - not off it lol.  Good luck to Man Utd too.
By the end of the Season Man United will be 12th and then Chelsea will be 6th
Syed.anas.montri
You could hit that Fernando's shot 20 times one score about 3, the ball had a minimal bounce and he somehow anticipated it perfectly with the shape of his boot as he struck it. The other 17 would go wide I reckon. Some hit that  I remember Rooney hat trick goal for Everton against Joe Hart in the west ham goal at goodison that was an impulsive hit and had to beat the last defender as well who was tracking back well to be fair. Just waffle from a tired everton fan bored and waiting to go to bed, don't want any thumbs up, let me drift off into the abyss please cos I'll forget which random comment it was referring to when I get the notification, then I'll have to read what I typed for no reason at 3.30am and then ill think why did I think that out loud and think youtubers would care what crossed my mind as I watched highlights from a match I had nothing invested in... just a waste of my time really and yours if you read this far. So sorry all. If you wanna waste my time be my guest and make me get a notification or something to waste my time in return    Hold on didn't I just ask for this not to happen? I can't remember... lemme read back and edit it if I need to once I've posted it. Done it to myself now grrrr... everytime!!!!
Is that van dijk shouting hey quansah (I know it's spelt wrong I couldn't care less) whilst seemingly pointing back to the keeper? If so, Quanza obviously heard the shout but missed the pointing... if van dijk make the shout surely he should have just said 'keeper'... job done... no goal... anyone who's played pro clubs knows this ha
Liverpool  keeper  what a mess   no professional  why hell so far off his line if he stays in his goal we dont score  glad we did  only we give away silly pen at end  utd could  have taken all 3 points  in a match  that should have been out of our sight at half time   goes to show your team can have all the   Possession all the shots on goal  all the fancy  foot work  means nothing  if you can't put ball in the net  fair play utd kept at it got a result  as say could have won it at the end   but as against  Chelsea  we give away a silly pen  watched it over and over was a pen  did not get the ball  but I take  a point and Liverpool  drop 2
Lol 💯 Blackpool fan he ain’t Evan seen inside old Trafford 😂
If Liverpool lose this title by 1 point and you think back to the Spurs game omg
Macheda, is that you?
You spelt chaos wrong
Comn om liverpool  crest
Just realise Kelleher tried to hand Bruno goal out the box 😅
United are awful. They get controlled by every team at home & away. They need to give up playing. They're finished. They will never be back.
Chaos is a ladder
I hate when Sky cut out the full celebration....why do they keep making that mistake.
Soon we'll have the technology to mute Carragher and Neville, but hear everything else
Nunez missing that chance cost us big time, that was the easiest open goal opportunity cause the keeper was having to stretch and still couldn’t fully cover that end
Wan-Bissaka. Liability. Unless you are certain, you never throw yourself to  a slide-tackle like that...
The keeper is lucky he never got a hand to uniteds 1st he would of have been sent off if he did.
How come they didn't show the 103 shots off target? You know, the ones that should have went in 😂
The defending from Utd's midfield is genuinely laughable. It's beyond horrendous how poorly Mainoo, Casemiro and Fernandes sense danger.
Aaron didn't even touch elliot
Klopps face was priceless
someone tell the dutchman that it's ok to wear a hat or coat hood when it's raining and cold. PLEASE!!!!     Love u Chico and RoRo.
Harvey Elliot’s DIRTY dive.
Good game tbh. It was a fair result. Liverpool weren't clinical enough & utd hung in there.l & scored some amazing goals. The question is, why can't utd show that heart & determination week in week out?
Wow that Mainoo goal was a beauty, reminds me of a Thierry Henry finish. Big future for him I’m sure.
The best part of Brunos goal is Kellehers desperation. He fully attempted to palm it away even though he was yards outside of the box. Zesty finish.
How does Nunez only save his performances for Newcastle? Most inconsistent striker ever against a Man Utd team who continue to get away with it all season.
United
The tackle by Wan Bissaka was so unnecessary, Bradley was going nowhere! 😢
Remember  when  arsenal win the league blame quansah
Filthy dirty scummy shitepool
Mainoo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maino 🔥
Kelleher lucky he didn't get a hand to that Fernandes strike. Straight red.
Mainoo channelling his inner macheda for that goal… nearly 15 years to the day too!
Mainooo🔥🔥🔥
Man U fans laughing at a team 22points above them is funny the way there playing they won’t even be in europa league soon when West Ham take over them
Hard to believe nobody in the media is talking about the penalty decision. Clear, clear dive!
What a game
That first initial save from onana was class
I'ma liver fan n honestly man u goals were amazing ngl 🙈
👏👏👏Mainoo is a great talent I hope he plays in the euros
Can't believe that was a penalty, was in the stadium for the game but seeing it on here that was never a pen
😢
I dont support either  ut I see Liverpool are still diving in the box after all these years...
01:14 the moment when the Premiership title slips away.
I don’t feel like anyone is talking about how good Bruno’s goal is - doesn’t fit the witch-hunt
Why did you not show the goal from garnancho TAHTS os I really like the finish but I can’t see it again
Mainoo number 7# next year! Mark my words
We're in need of Jota the Slotta, big-time!! YNWA!!
Congratulations to Liverpool for winning the 23/24 Premier League
Thats because i bet for Liverpool
how come I didn't get assist points for Quansah in FPL?
Salah put the Man Utd fans in their place with that well placed penalty 👏🏽 👍🏽
How to do banana salad
How the hell didn't we score four or five
Great game to watch live. Unreal atmosphere!
shame keeper didn't stop bruno's goal, would have been a straight red
ohhh nooo 2-2. YNWA
Thank you Manchester united
Only Tottenham left from big six sides.😎 Liverpool fans
Anyone notice Harvey Elliot scream at AWB when he won the penalty? Abysmal sportmanship
Liverpool relying on yet another penalty... Mainoo is unreal
Liverpool should have wrapped this game up by half-time but allowed Utd back in and only just scrapped a draw.
That's the problem with the small clubs when the big boys come to town they up there game
Like man united please sport man united tel me
Would have been better if the keeper got a hand to Brunos shot, He would have been sent off
Liverpool are the biggest tantrum merchants in the league when things don't go their way
Bruno's goal was amazing I was not expecting that
Fernandez goal copy of Mctominay v Man City
Mainoo goal copy of Macheda v Aston Villa.
One the most exciting premier league seasons yet
Mo has to put one of them away surely? Whats the matter with him lately.?.
Grr
Watching this live was crazy 🤯
Unhooking goal by mainooo
Kambvala should be sent off, mankies
Fernandes goal is amazing
Match fixing going on here.
Well done United, you just gave Arsenal the title. Would it really have been so hard to lose?
Not a pen
United need to enjoy Kobbie while they can… I can already hear Real Madrid calling him👀
Don’t worry Marino Im watching your goal as much as you are
Lets gooooooo man utd
Nobody was talking about MacAlister too class performance 👏
Great dive from Elliot and Sky sports showing the only view where by you cant see Wan B doesn't touch him.
Mainoo became prime Macheda there
2:26 Onana makes lodes of mistakes
Reds carry on boys 🎉🎉
2:20 Elliot angry with wen bissaka
Kelleher???? Isn’t switched on
How did kobbie Mainoo score he’s Rubbish
Fair play to the Utd fans. Nothing to show for the season's efforts, and still cheering at mediocrity.
That was never a penalty. Wan Bissaka didn't even touch him. VAR screwed us once again. Still what a colossal performance from Kambwala & a truly peach of a goal from Mainoo. Still that's 3 games in a row where we've bottled a lead. Becoming the norm unfortunately
Utd lots money no title ?💰💰💰💰💰
Thanks for the title lads!! Liverpool couldn't even give us a fight lol COYG
Both those United goals were absolutely amazing. Just a shame we had to ruin it with giving away a penalty.
Utd were roobed
Garnacho carrying the team my Nacho boy strikes againnnn❤❤❤
That just wasn't good enough. You can't be messing up the basic as much as we do not being able to score rebound from 2 4 yards is just shocking
Great finish from Fernandes, didn't hesitate.   From neutral perspective united got lucky though. They are currently an average side with an average manager. Their luck will run out at some point.  Surely ETH should be doing better? Surely scraping a draw against Liverpool in the hope it might prevent them winning the league shouldn't be the best thing about your Prem Season. I'm genuinely not a fan of either team but whilst I get they are your biggest rivals, surely it's not good enough?
salah is so washed
Good result for city 💙
Still don’t know Liverpool got that pen Liverpool acc think they are gonna win the league when they should of lost to a team in 6th place 😂
Husband: *watching Man Utd vs Liverpool*  Wife: he’s definitely cheating… I heard him
Liverpool miss Jota as he's more clinical, controlled, and sharp minded than Nunez or Gakpo
Say what you want united were the better team liverpool had 3x the shots and only 2 more on target keep shooting from the halfway line liverpool your not Bruno!
I've been supporting Man U since 1995 - 28 years. We still need to improve to get back to winning ways. I'll take a draw this time.
Liverpool sucks😂😂😂😂
Gotta be selling AWB or Dalot
Still can't win at Old Trafford without Naby Keita.
That keepers career is over loo
Great dive that!
Ngl but man utd keep on giving away stupid pens
Lucky LiVARpool gifted free penelty
Second goal is unbelievable nothing you can do about that , but that sloppy ass pass from quansah,  no more of that please , cost us but we walk on together we love you Liverpool Y.N.W.A ❤️
That pen was a joke your usual Liverpool Bailout
DIAZ WITH HIS 31203981092381038102938TH TAP IN AS USUAL SCORES TERRIBLE GOALS
Salahs penalty was what made me jus scream even though united scored literal screamers
I'm 100% more than happy to be in the Europa league as its a platform for our 3 bright stars and we've still got the FA Cup to look forward to. Our Trophy cabinet is bigger than anyone else, s and we will win more especially with these 3 young super stars 💪
Wan bissaka didn't even go nobwhere near him chat rubbish
Technical question? As the Liverpool goalkeeper touched the ball outside the penalty area on Fernandez goal, should he have been sent off?
Liverpool don't have enough quality to win when it really matters,  that's one of klopp's weaknesses,  never bought enough quality in the 9 years he's there , unlikely to win a second title now , missed too many chances that top quality strikers just don't do, salah going, klopp going in the summer,  hard to know where Liverpool go from here.
casemiro is completely finished didnt see him run or make a decent pass throughout the whole game
Good game
2:11 😮😀😀😀🫡🫡🫡
Mainoo , , and hojlund have never lost against Liverpool
The way Darwin Nunez misses those chances makes me realize I can do anything in life.
Tom Daley is going to incorporate the “Elliot” into his routine at the next World Championships
Great game a game that was open but Liverpool have thrown away the title now,
Irnonic that Klopp bemoans Citys millions having spent over a billion himself only to see Arsenal go top and have the league title in their own hands - having spent half of what Klopp has.
Never a penalty in a million years that how var have given that is a joke
can this statue not see whats happening in front of him he thinks tactics are a little mint  one week up for it next game lets have stroll round the pitch no gaffers in the team its like watching a junior team on a saturday mrn
you take any mate from a construction site, and still better than Darwin Nunez
If the keeper gets a hand to the Fernandez shot he’s would have been sent off anyway. Def outside the area.
Mam united
Bruno Fernandes now that was a bit special
Never a pen
0:52 Absolutely criminal how much space Diaz had in the box for that first goal
Bruno's goal reminded me of the cavani goal Vs villa
Why not show the disallowed goal?
Bruno's reaction to mainoo's goal. Love it
onana always dives before the penalty is taken.  making them so easy to just put in the other side.
Mainoo and garnacho are going to be monsters they keep scoring
Shame no Jota it would have been a thrashing a absolute hammering
Liverpool did not deserve that pen we were incredible credit Kobie maino he was wonderful ❤❤👇🏻
Liverpool lost the match and probably the premier title.
Klopp under achieving yet again and people think hes a great manager 😂 cant even beat worst united team in years 💀
Ten hag wanted to sell Maguire. Thank god he wasn't able to, we'd be mid table without him
rashford will still be the first name on the teamsheet for England. You wouldn't know he was playing .
Bissaka is such a donut 🍩 for that tackle
At this game in the East stand. The stands erupted when Mainoo dipped the ball in the top corner. Truly an amazing game
Mainoo goal was crazy beautiful 🙌
That wasn't a penalty. Exactly what is VAR for?
Liverpool threw this away, they should have had 4 or 5! Some very poor decision making at back and in box!! Luckiest Draw v Liverpool for UTD EVER!! 😮
Liverpool 'bottled it' this year. Again so close, yet so far. No FA cup, no PL. Shocking game, miss after miss after miss oh and the back pass. Stop back passing. Teams in 90s and 00s hardly did back passes. Move the ball forward 😊
Mainoo wow. Take a bow!!!
When will van dijk take responsibily for goal conceded. He marks no one and gives opposing players too much time on the ball. Passes on all the work to his centre back partner.
Crazy that you only show one replay of the penalty and don't show the angle where Wan-Bissaka doesn't even touch him
Mainoo is already the best player of all time by far
Seeing klopps face when Maino scored that goal made my day and I’m not even a United fan😂😂
Kobbie Mainoo is truly a special one. GGMU
diverpool haha wasnt even a peno
God, Liverpool have had some shocking away shirts over the years
The expected goals in the three games cumulatively is roughly 1.8-8.7 in favour of Liverpool but the actual score is 6-5 in favour of United 🤣
THEN a player was given yellow card for diving, NOW a penalty is given for diving. Those referees are ruining the beautiful game of football.
Yeah show Liverpool's offside chances but not United's offside goals. They're still a highlight.
These penalties are sooo soft
It’s perfectly clear now that Liverpool fc will implode like we did in 21/22, it’s the same old story. We need a Owen/rush/fowler urgently if we are going to win major trophies. We may do what we did in 21/22 and win 2 cups but as we all recall we blew the prem big time and screwed up in paris , same old story we couldn’t score enough, our defence is shocking too. Concede concede concede . We deserve nothing and when you struggle to put away teams like Sheffield united/Nottingham Forest and lose 4 points to a pub side like Man U you just know 3rd position is the best you can hope for!
Never a peno
No chaos just a good game of football. Why garnacho goal in 1st min not a highlight?
What chaos are you referring to?
Spurs are really going to shape how this race will end.
Goal of the season 2024
considering how bad united were in the last 3 games , we could and should have come away with 9 points
That is not a penalty ref 😂
Wonderful 2nd half performance from Utd terrible first half but they got the point needed to derail Liverpools title bid. Happy Days 😂😂😂 now we will win the FA cup and chase down Villa in 5th which might just be enough to get champions league.
The Wan-Bissaka foul for the pen is so so clumsy and careless!
garnacho goal not a highlight?
Like this comment if you a man united fan
Absolute JOKE of a penalty decision.
The guy was already diving before AWB touched him?
Got to love the commentator Drury
Take that goal away from Fernandes and he was the worst player on the pitch AGAIN.... How many times did he lose possession and play a poor pass? Getting slower by the game, he has to go!
Hi
What a stupid tackle to make, Elliott was going no where! And United win the game. Simple.
Slippy g ❌              Shitty quansah ✅
Love the way Bruno latched on to that loose pass and had the presence of mind to shoot
No replay of the dive....
Onana I do think is a good GK but too many goals go in against him in close to the centre of the net he has to stop those
The games these 2 are serving up lately are quality 😂
Garnacchio s disallowed goal ???????? Where is it !!!!
Liverpool not taking chances in the first half was very very poor indeed
Nah not convinced on Liverpool now. They aren’t clinical enough! The finishing is very poor from Nunez and salah it really is! Such sloppy play from them that you wouldn’t see at arsenal or Man City. So for me, it’s between arsenal and citeh!
Coventry comings for you united
Wan Bissaka is a spanner for even attempting that, no point atall 0 Composure in the box once he’s off the wing he can’t do his thing
1:17 - add that to the list of G Neville sounds.
Carragher is so unprofessional. He needs to be taken off these games.
That moan 🤣
Salah is finished at top top level. Legs have gone
That wasnt a pen
That was not a penalty
Where’s Allison
UNITED ROBBED NOT A PENALTY!!!!!!!!
Two cracking , awesome goals by Man Utd. Liverpool were lucky to equalize at the end with the penalty. Im a Liverpool fan. I hope they will the league. But they have Arsenal and Man City to contend with.  I think Man City will win the league but who knows.
Ọnana has been amazing
What a dive by Harvey elliott
how was that a pen whn he never made any contact.
Nunez...best striker in the Premier League...😂😂😂😂😂
Top performances by mainoo, onana, dalot and kambwala but everyone else needs to step it up.
From a United fan, You’re welcome Arsenal 🤝 now go and win the league.
Have to be realistic, would Liverpool have taken being where they are now at the stat of the season?? Hell yeah, would man utd, no chance   mind the gap
If Liverpool had a ruthless striker, this game would have ended 5 or 6 - 2, and United fans would be calling for Ten Hag's bald head again lol.
United flying in heavy all the time all over. It cost them the win in the end. That’s their problem. Liverpool deserved 1-4. But ‘deserve’ has nothing got to do with it. That’s their problem to think about.
There’s only a few guarantees in life.. death, taxes and Mo Salah scoring at Old Trafford 🫠🫠
Liverpool did terrible tbf
Question: if SAF was in charge, would the penalty have been given, or would it have been a booking for diving?😂
Every pre match between United and Liverpool is always talking about how United could take a battering (which I’m not doubting the possibility) but Klopp has only won once against ETH’s United so…..yeah.
LIVERPOOLS KIDS HAVE WON IT Oh wait 😂😂😂
Floppool threw away another title 😂😂
Give my idol palah pens or he ghost
Wasnt even a pen 😂
"Hey Quansah!" before he sets up Bruno for a belter 😂 Mainoo and that goal though 😨
That wasn't a penalty, didn't even touch him one bit. VAR at its finest
Mainoo finesse shot is different gravy
Why take Garnacho off?
Even as Arsenal fan I feel for Quansah, mistakes happen (what a time to make your first one of the season tho😅)and I think he's a brilliant young defender. Hope he keeps his head up going forward
Maino’s ceiling is terrifying, I would love him to stay but he deserves to go thrive at a well run club
Calvert-Lewin: scores ridiculous goal Fernandes: “Hold my beer.”
Get that boy on the plane.
Kambwala man of the match today for me quality from The young man. On the other hand Casemiro was a 3/10 at best drop off from last season is terrible
Ngl I’m mad it’s 2-2 bc I Support Liverpool and I wanted them to win
Thank goodness for that I’m a Arsenal supporter and we where hoping for it to be a draw but sometimes god does the unthinkable ❤
Kobie mainoo is on another level❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Coming from a city fan fair play to united played brilliant today
watching this back, man united were of course bad but liverpool were so wasteful
Rather arsenal won the league than Liverpool any united fan would agree.... Liverpool without klopp will be united...mark my words
As a city fan thank u United.
Quansah😅😅absolutely gifted that to bruno
Wanbisaka 🤦🤦🤦
Didnt see salah the whole game till the penalty 👀
Bisaka challenge is big mistake for us to win the game , Liverpool player wasn't a threat make me very upset , its time to bring youngsters to first team , onana is useless goalkeeper if i was a coach i will try the Turkish goalkeeper i will give him a chance and trust him , where is emad you can see rashford in bad shape , we need to buy a cheap player but good like the algerian amoura he is fast and he create panic against defenders , get Brazilian youngsters and nice defenders from italy ,  we will be the best .
Dive
Bloodys hells.
If Liverpool don't win the title, this game will haunt them. United were utter crap (as they often are), and had just about given up before Liverpool gifted them their equaliser.
Deffo dive 😂
The moment it left his boot he knew 😌
1:17 Thanks for the new ring-tone, Carra. 😂
So basically if Liverpool didn't make a silly mistake and actually finished their chances, They would of won this game 1-6 😂😂 You don't win titles playing like this 🤷🏻‍♂️.
Never a pen. Not a single bit of contact. I don't understand this idea of "he had every right to go down when the defender sticks out a leg". There was no contact, therefore it MUST have been a dive, going off the laws of physics. Yellow card. How that kind of thing is a penalty, I will never understand.
Casemiro is a liability! Utd needs to stop being a retirement home for old players.
How is nobody mentioning that was not a penalty 😂
T
Thank you manchester - all arsenal fans 😂
Well done United. Never letting fans down by messing up game after game after game
Van dijk saying hey quansah is legendary
This game had everything for the neutrals… Diaz goal, screamers, Dives, scatty Onana movements, moaning commentary (pause)… Only thing missing was a red card
The day Liverpool lost the title.
Quansah and Kelleher cost Liverpool the win. Gutted.
Nunez is shite!!
Harvey is pure quality
after watching that shambles with chelsea midweek this is a bit better at least
Never a penalty joke
Weird choice to not show the offside goal…
United are soooo shite this year but Liverpool haven't been able to beat them in 3 games this season.  Liverpool look classes above but if you cant put your chances away and continue to have sloppy moments, then you only have yourself to blame.
It’s “chaos” because united should have won? Neville on commentary sounded like he wanted Liverpool to win, the united hate is unreal, Mainoo world class potential, Kambwala had nunez in his back pocket rock solid performance
We love that Elliot dive!!!
Nothing better than seeing Klopp rattled 😂😂😂
2:20 jurgen whinge and i dont like man utd either all he does is cry
2 bangers for Man U 🔥🔥
Liverpool have blown it Man City champs
Way
Liverpool bottling the title - lovely 😂
gary neville commentator cursed the bruno goal 😔
ARSENAL ARSENAL ARSENAL
Mainoo🎉
United have lost 17 times this season in all competitions, one of the worst United teams in recent history...and yet Liverpool havn't beaten them once in 3 attempts this season. The delusion the dippers have thinking they are good enough to win the league. Comedy gold.
Klopp punished for playing quansah over konate
Has history repeated itself with Liverpool throwing the game and the Premiership away from a  careless blunder like Stephen Gérard against Chelsea  some years back?
Liverpool are sooooooooo wasteful in front of goal its shocking.  Also their defense is SHOCKINGLY bad
The question is, how on earth have they managed to stay in the race for so long?  Its always been between Arsenal and City tbh.  Theyve been a useful pacemaker and now theyve been overtaken.  City will get them next and then its 😮😮😮
Mainoo wow
1:17 you good jamie
Everyone can beat this united team…except liverpool 🤣
Arsenal's name has been on league trophy a long time now. Best defence & best attack 👏   Gunners have taken 4 points off 'Pool & City now. All they have to do is beat the small teams now. 😊
we havent beaten these incompetent United players in the last 3 games! I think the 7-0 has affected the mentalilty when playing against them. We think they are too easy and dont work as hard.
thank you united
Tom grennan playing for Liverpool
I don't think that's a penalty
Nunez simply isn't good enough. He keeps missing opportunities and the kop sing his name. He's not only resembles Andy Carroll but plays as badly as him. I hope Klopp doesn't put choose him for the rest of the season and get rid
Never a penalty in a million years...,.as is so often the case Liverpool get a helping hand from the officals, as they are instructed to do by the FA!
Super disappointed with the lads today we can’t win the league again if we are dropping points where it matters. We now have just to have our fingers crossed arsenal bottle it but I’m not too hopeful myself. Severely missing jota in our attack need him back asap to hold out the rest of the season.
Liverpool must hold the record for creating the most chances in football history and not scoring
Probably England's biggest rivalry
Should have been United - Liverpool 2-4
Thank you for beating Liverpool for me. The offside goal was clear authentic. No offside. Penalty a joke of the century. No contact at all. The referees do not like Manchester United Manager. Thank you, boys. Liverpool can beat any other team in Premiership, not Manchester United.
Can't stop thinking about Mainoo's incredible goal. What a super young talent he is becoming, it had kiko machedas winner Vs villa vibes written all over it. ❤
Harvey Elliot see this kid in 2 years!
Where is the first offside goal for united?
To dominate that much and need the ref to buy a dive to get a point against that united side is pretty pitiful. Third place beacons for lucky Liverpool.
What's wrong with Nunez , everytime I watch him in match winning positions he  messes up
Nunez is shocking
Where's the chaos???
Mainooo sensational goal wow
I thought Salah was awful today, aside from the goal he was useless today
Haven't seen Kloop visibly angry with his own players for quite some time. That Mainoo screamer brought it out of him...
Peter Drury”What about it”. ❤❤❤Thanks Manchester Utd for giving us an edge at last you were not as useless as I thought 😂😂😂😂
If Arsenal win the league on goal difference it will be forever remembered that Quansah cost us the title
Ref gives a pen against nan utd, another ref for the sack then !!.  How nan utd survived with a draw ill never know.
Mainoo goal was special as was Bruno but wow man utd really are difficult to predict, they are good, great, crap, awful in 1 game almost every game
Maino's goal was reminiscent of Macheda v Villa, all those years ago.
Bruno has (often rightfully) had his critics, but that's a great first-time strike.
These two on commentary are fantastic. Proper good double act.
Defender always gets blamed there and rightly so but what on earth was kelleher doing that far out his box
This shows why it’s important to put your shots away
Sadly, it's a keeper issue today, and that misplaced pass can be costly...
God it feels good knocking them scruffy scousers out the cup and denting there title hopes all in 2 weeks😂😂 COYG
I can hear Neville screaming again!  😂 but great performance from the devils, draw isn’t the best but at least we aren’t getting battered. ❤
Rio was correct 👌🏻
we should ve been more clinical in front of goal. in the first half, utd didn't show
Happy Arsenal 😂
The goal from Diaz was crazy
Highlights arent doing justice..lpool were 20 times better than manu..but again the same issue, lack of true no9 who can push the ball in. An other lucky escape for manu. (If lpool could get to 0-2, would have been an other 0-7 )
As an Arsenal fan, we have a strong chance on winning the title in 20 years.   Arsenal cannot afford to hiccup.
Harvey Elliott diving again, he's learning well from Salah I see.
How Utd got anything from this game is beyond me
That Bruno Goal Looked Like It Was On Accident
Liverpool cheating for 1 point 🤣
That Mainoo goal was tasty!
Arsenal have the tougher run in and we still have a nose in front of Man City who also have a tough run in. All to play for.
So that wasnt a dive💀
Mainoo and Garnacho will both be gone
Tbh Liverpool could have been leading by at least 3 goals at half time so UTD are having another parade in Manchester for the luckiest point against a Liverpool team who are doing unbelievable after having no team 6 months ago and the kids already have a trophy what a turnaround by the boss klopp come on the mighty reds ❤️ YNWA 💚  🙏97🙏
Arsenal fan here. Liverpool have bottled it 😂😂
Mainoo snuff said ❤️🙏🙏
Manchester United are now able join me
Onana is unstoppable
Dear Arsenal fans: We have done our job. Do yours please.
Diaz is my fave Liverpool player he just keeps popping up and his resilience is quality, if he stays at Liverpool in the long term he will score plenty of goals and don’t be surprised if he breaks records
Keeper is lucky he didnt touch that shot from bruno's goal otherwise down to 10 men
What is god's name is Wan-Bissaka doing for that penalty. And while we are on the note of screw ups, Fernandes just watches the ball come across for Diaz to have a shot late on.......We have to be a LOT tighter than that. How we have somehow managed to be unbeaten by liverpool this season is beyond me!
where chaos?
Manchester united providing entertaiing football once again
First time I've ever cheered on Utd. And they nearly got the win!! We are still top on GD. This is gonna be a nail biting end to the season!!
I don’t think Liverpool have beat United this season 😅
Now, everyone can see that we haven’t replaced Mane or Firmino. We just rely on Salah and his goals. We aren’t title favourites anymore, we need to rely on other results and it always went wrong for us when we did
What is wan bissaka thinking? To dive in like that at that time in the game is just nuts.
Liverpool are 1 SUAREZ away from winning the league.  Hence why Man City will win the Premier league.    YNWA.
Thank you United....now come on you gunners!!!
Poor defending by United as always! Regardless of injuries, that's no excuse!!
City won the league today.
Absolute state of mo salah
Eth out
Only a United player can get a rare assist and give away a penalty in the same game.
Again sloppy mistakes cost us  Dropping points to to poor sides will be Liverpool's downfall
Man Utd probably dent Liverpool chance of winning the EPL Title, having outplaying Utd in FH and only 1-Zip up,two Scrumptious goals for Utd in SH,turn the game upside down,but for unwanted penalty conceded via Utd, Liverpool would only come away with a draw,game highlights....👋
Well done utd❤
AWB and Kambwalas fantastic todsy. Well done boys.
This is that defining moment that determines the champions this season. There's still Arsenal Liverpool that might upset everything but definitely that IT moment. The intensity of the games will only get higher from here.
Wambasaka just uncessary challenge
Never a penalty.....I've seen it in slow motion from all angles and Wan bissaka never even made contact, from behind it looks like he took him clean out, but the other angles show he never made contact. Mainoo's goal deserved to win the match, as did Fernandes goal. But at least Liverpool didn't go top.
Mainoo man 💯💯 unreal
Incredible from Salah again his record is unbelievable that is a massive point for Liverpool all the pressure is on Arsenal
Only person I'm praising in our team is the kid with his second start, Kambwala...solid performance.
Onana has been in such good form
Liverpool need to stop expecting to trounce united . Learn .
Never a penalty btw
Take that Liverpool!
We did our job over to you arsenal lol. We just out here helping others in a terrible season. Hopefully we can finish off the season with a trophy cant wait for the season to end
C'mon man u Liverpool should be in the Irish league as they say there not English
Kobieeee🥶🥶
Poor result but We will be back arsenal and city have the tougheat run of fixtures so no doubt both teams will drop points just need to focus on the couple of hard games remaining ynwa come on you reds
2:15 thats gotta be Neville in the background screamin his lungs out, on a par with the Torres moan
Liverpool are such bottlers
Wasteful from our attackers yet again, thank god we didn’t lose but can’t lie this draw feels more like a loss. Once we get Jota and Trent back hopefully things will quickly change — 7 games to go though, and all three teams could drop points at any minute. Still very much in with a chance for the title but we need to stop being so complacent.
Commentator is much better than Martin Tyler but he lost his lunch over a penalty
Elliott should of been brought on earlier. Thats twice he has saved Liverpool against Them Lot
You can hear GARY at the back ❤
Weird take but I think Alister deserves to be in the front three. His a great midfielder but I see him as a better choice than salah or darwin. Darwin has pace but no accuracy and salah is like an old man who can’t make plays anymore.
Pretty bad to be dropping points to the smaller teams but I have faith in Liverpool we got this title 🔥
The first thing you learn as CB never pass across your own back line unnecessarily ESPECIALLY without looking
What a game
Does anyone know which player called Quansah's name on the error leading to the Bruno goal? 😂😂😂😂😂
At 1.15 you can hear a player shout "Hey, Quansah!" - Fernandes tricking Quansah?
gary's noise when mainoo scores LOOL
Kelleher is high and addicted to nose sweets 1:18
kloop has lost twice as many games against eth then his won 😂
Just want to ask based on what Fernandis was sushhhhing who after scoring like really!!!!!
England's midfield is unreal
Erik ten Hag does not believe in midfield i'm sure of it.
Liverpool were not clinical that cost them the win but give the rival credit good game.
That's the game they needed to win !! It's arsenals to lose now
Everyone saying Liverpool dominated, which they did in the first half but United also could have scored easily another 1-2 goals today.
MAINOO MUST HAVE SEEN ALL THOSE GOALS THAT HARRY KANE SCORED LIKE THAT( MAINLY AGAINST GOONERS)
The fact man united had 0.0 expected goals after the first half shows how meaningless a stat it is, considering garnacho was offside by less than a foot when he scored, and hoijlund headed the ball across the six years box ready to be tapped in
Carra is crying 😅😅
Damn, Utd have become our bogie team. They lift their game when they play us like lower tier teams sometimes do. Its like a cup final for them. We should be smashing 5/6 goals against a team with one of the worst defensive records in the PL. A draws as good as a loss against this lot.
Short and simple ' no one can challenge city to a title Noooo one !  For city to lose title they wud have to have a bad season like 2019/20 and 2015/16
We're all talking about the bruno and mainoo goals
Naaah C'mon You Have To Show Garnacho's Offside Goal In The 1st Minute
Liverpool wasteful again in front of goal. Maino a terrific goal. A point for both teams. Onto the next one.
Peter Drury is class commentator
As a arsenal fan let’s go
Arsenal thanks you!
Who watches it live on BBC sports 👇🏾
Title is gone after that btw. City run in is a joke. Five at home. Cannot see them doing anything but win all 7 and pile up the goal diff.
Listening to Liverpool fans before this game was hillirious 😂
We missed too many chances……again! 🙈YNWA!
Why is nobody questioning that penalty? Diving over the leg!! I’m surprised referees are still fooled by this even after studying var
Itll be  city champions
With Nunes in attack, don't hope to  win the title. You need a goal scorer, not one guy who miss twenty changes and score one goal.
Liverpool aren't such a big deal.... they've failed to beat Arsenal, City and the average United this season.... it's ok their fans celebrating when they beat all the dross in the Premiership and in the Europa league. But to only take five points from Arsenal, City and United, tells it's own story.
The Sky commentator are awful, can someone please tell him that shouting the name of a player at every shot IS NOT COMMENTATING
United helping City claim an unprecedented 4IAR and back to back trebles.
Jordon Henderson,s Liverpool 7-0 Van Dirks Liverpool 2-2 theres levels to football
Liverpool turn into spurs in recent title run ins
Why would anyone dive in there what is he doing at all
They done mainoo dirty in the thumbnail
Casemiro deserved a red we could’ve scored that absolutely fuming
Congrats man city...only short an Arsenal slip up
Liverpool bottled it twice now against United could see it coming again going in at half time only one up after all them chances. They really need to get some strikers who can put the ball in the back of the net all that money they are on and they just useless at times.
That might be a very important point for Liverpool
Liverpool or united
Mainoo vs macheda
The future is looking promising for Mainoo-ited
Mainoo is one talented player ❤
Liverpools defence will cost them dear, and they are missing Jota's consistency in front of goal, Nunez and Diaz are erratic.
Nunez and Diaz are great players but both need to be more clinical. Jota would have had a hatrick in this game with chances they had.
never seen worse bad dive lol 😂😂
Willy really rose to the occasion today. 👏👏👏
The referees and var are setting the bar lower and lower for penalties this season, drag someone to the ground - no penalty, touch a player on his way down faintly - penalty, its either rigged or incompetentce
Liverpool always stumble against lesser Teams 🤷🏽‍♂️
Pooonez 😂
Mainoo hit that Macheda finish
When on earth will Liverpool get a top clinical striker, Nunez not good enough. Too many failed opportunities to go 2 points clear
2:13 love that you can hear Carragher and Neville screaming 😂
What was Darwin Nunez thinking by not squaring it to Szbozlai, the guy leaves me speechless at times
Bottle job by Liverpool
Inexperience showed its face in the right back unfortunately. Strange old result though after first half.
We were pathetic so many chances to bury the game and utd and we haven't learnt our lesson against utd in the cup game 2 wks ago but at least we didn't lose and there is 7  tough games ahead for the top 3 anything can happen keep the faith YNWA
Mainoo and Kambwala amazing talents ❤
mainoo is different gravy
very good end of the season  no team have the right to draw or lose they all have to win all there remaining fixture
DIVE
Mainoo only does bangers
Liverpool have lost that fear factor that ruthlessness, i do honestly believe its because klopp announced he will leave at the end and j think thats thrown players into uncertainty look at bayern they announced tuchel will leave at the end now they are crap
Liverpool missed far too many chances..yet again. Badly in need of clinical no 9 striker. Nunez, Diaz and Salah are not no 9 strikers. Jota is good but not consistent. Need a home grown no 9 in the same vein as Robbie Fowler or Michael Owen. Sturbridge and Suarez were the last decent out and out goal scorers Liverpool had. Title is going up in smoke due to sloppiness.
Should have won today,if we lose the league I'm blaming quansah!
United conceding a silly penalty
Que the Mainoo fanbois calling him out to be generational again, bar the goal which was very good he was just as abominable as the rest of the United team today.  Again Liverpool gifted them the first goal.  Watch United go back to default mode in there next game.
Unbeaten against liverpool this season 👍 they were lucky to draw against us 😂😂
Scam United always raise there game against the bigger team... absolute robbery here and the cup.. they are hilarious... Mainooooos goal was good.. give him that.. but to come off saying "disappointed it wasnt 3 points" shows there delusion hahaa
Fair play Onana, finding himself some form :)
Kobbie mainoo what a player has a bright future ahead of him that's for sure
Missus: My mother is coming tonight for dinner Me: 1:17
Darwin, Sobo & Salah poor form lately.  In all Liverpool couldn’t finish their dinner.
Thank you for giving us the tittle no one is going to beat us city and Liverpool hopes are over
Anyone before the game who said Liverpool would get a win here doesn't understand this fixture
Penalty for liVARpool
Imagine what we will do when we get a good team again 🔴⚪️⚫️
Man united look like they've bottled a champions league place 😂
Great assist for the bruno goal 😢😢😢
Manchester was truly united for this game.
Salah is the most overted player in PL ever
Nunez was awful Salaah missed way too many chances. Harvey Elliot should have played from the start. Poor Poor pass by the Center Back
Don’t understand why Garnacho’s disallowed isn’t considered a chance?
This is boring
mainoo is wheeling away to the fans before it goes in, its one of them, he knows it’s going in soon as it leaves his foot, awsome strike 🤩
My team are bottle jobs who cant hit a barn door. Congrats to either Arsenal or City
Liverpool need to be more clinical in front of goal. With Jones back and Jota returning this month Liverpool will be able to push for the title. Quansah's mistake was unfortunate but he's still building experience. I still think Liverpool should have beaten United. Liverpool were the better team.
What a waste of chances by Liverpool, but that second United goal deserved to be a winning goal!
Da PEWel EVER Reliant on set-pieces to get their goals in most matches even v a fairly bog-standard United. Set-piecepewel
When Bruno hit the ball from half way it touched the goal keeper’s hand. It should of been a red card
No one applauding Onana😢😢😢 He's been good...
Brilliant goals from Bruno and Mainoo- just not a great full performance
United need to stop conceding penalties. This has cost them back-to-back now.
Get Mainoo on that plane Gareth!
I thought it was way behind the centre circle like pele miss in the world cup final
Quansah with that Gerrard v Chelsea moment. Livercucks have thrown it away, it's Arsenal and City all the way now
Red Devils from out of the blue was a bar
Liverpool lost the league today
Kobbie 🇬🇭❤️🥹
That s not a clear penalty easy given
Do sad sky don't do goals of the month or week anymore
Not a word about the blatant dive. Media love in for Liverpool continues
All the united fans celebrating a draw shows how far they have fallen 😂😂
Never a penalty for Liverpool no way
100% dive for the penalty, can’t see any contact to
Mainoo’s goal is a repeat of macheda v Villa I swear
Liverpool could have won if they put more effort into the game!
That commentator needs to calm down
It was strange being a Manchester United fan for 90 minutes today and celebrating Mainoo's strike like a madman when I'm a Gooner. It's a shame United couldn't hold on for the win but I'll take Liverpool dropping two points all day long. Thank you, Red Devils!
Reminder that Salah and Nunez were pocketed by Harry Maguire and a 19 year old...
That lucho goal reminded me of Mbappe’s World Cup goal in the final (his 2nd goal)
Lijnders has to consider being Liverpools next manager
Nunez bottled it..
Salah the saviour 🫡
Another brilliant United bottle job
United not even 1 high light apart from the goals, lucky boys
😂
Po Palah
Not a pen
i like is 1 cookie
Even if united had won they are still a poor side with very average players.
Chaos by Gary Neville
Arsenal at the top, let’s goooo
Having watched all 3 games I cannot believe Liverpool didn’t manage to beat United once this season. Poor finishing has cost them dear. As for the first United goal that’s what I would expect Spurs to do at Anfield to gift Liverpool a goal in return for the nonsense in the first game. Great opportunist finish by Fernandes reminiscent of Salah v City a few years back!
Criminal that Liverpool let Utd come away with a point today. Manchester Utd are a shambles
What is going on with Liverpool, can’t pass a ball esp into the net.
That was a good match
Wat a game
how come sky never mentions the bald  ref from Manchester always doing city and utd games against Liverpool, he was roumered to be getting off the utd coach earlier in the afternoon,  😂😂
I hate that green square top. Why did they decide to retro a kit that the team is most famous for losing in? And against Man Utd?!?
That goal from Mainoo was special 👏 🔥
Title of vid is chaos, where was the chaos
Man Utd need to build around Mainoo. Simple.
So nobody gonna talk about fernanfes triumphant strike!!! 😮
I think uniteds goals were were top
Onana always goes the wrong way on penalties
That's why I'd never play a sweeper keeper!!  Your area is in the box!!
Wait hold on bro died lile hw wasn't miles outside the box 😂
We have bottled a Mount winner, Garnacho winner and Mainoo winner in the past week 😂
United fans dont get too excited normal service will resume next week vs Bournemouth
Mainoo is starting to love scoring agienst liverpool
Only thing missing was a VAR decision against LFC for the fans to moan about.
Good game
This is why Jurgen Klop is not a good manager 😅😅😅 1 prem title in 30 years and can't beat the red of Manchester in 3 games ❤😂
Told ya Liverpool is leaking too many goals
Salah and nunez werent fully awake 😭 cmon theyre way better than this
Why is taylor ref for nearly every liverpool match....
Great goal by Bruno Fernandes. He knew exactly what to do and executed it perfectly
Liverpool's wastefulness will cost them the league this season. To many times they have had control of the game but don't have the goals to show for it.   Everyone in the run in will fancy there chance against them because they can't kill games off and give away silly goals.  United are so shite and if it wasn't for them putting all there stat points into luck this season they would be in a relegation battle there that bad.
it's becoming the united way when winning to then completely switch off the last 10 minutes and concede stupid goals
When Mainoo hit it… Van Dyk knew it was going in if you look closely.
Never a penalty, hos stupid.
I'll be glad when Salah leaves, most overrated player ever. Gives possession away far too often. Squandered chance after chance, only themselves to blame!! Good performance by Man U though, never gave up
Mainoo machaeda esque
Once again Liverpool threw this game away. Should’ve been 3 nil up before half time.
How have Liverpool played utd 3 times this season, absolutely dominated every game and not won once. Footballs bizarre
The amount of chances salah wasting crazy
Good game gg
Kobbie miaoo goal to make it 2 - 2
This brudda moves like noone I have seen before, he's gonna be great
What an assist by quansah, put it on a plate for him.
1:16 what an assist from Quansah 🔥🔥🔥
I like Kobbie Mianoo
DO YOU BELIEVE THE MAINOO HYPE NOW😆😆😆
2:16 Gary needs new pants
As a spurs fan I like United more than Liverpool but hate them both coys😊
Neville's scream in the background of Mainoo's goal sounds like a baby crying 😂
Elliot dived but Liverpool fans keep talking about Doku.. Their 3 away games back to back vs Fulham, Everton and West Ham will finish them off 😊
We lose to Chelsea but then draw whith Liverpool dose that mean Chelsea is bettt then liverpool?
MAN UTD, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!
Didn't need to give that soft soft penalty he was going nowhere and looking for any contact.. gutted didn't hold out for the win!! Both Utd goals were gems :)
Liverpool should have won without that Bruno mistake
Imagine not beating this Utd team in 3 tries in Klipperty Klopps final season is crease 🤣🤣
Willy Kwabala was fantastic in this game
Why didn’t they show the angle where Wan Bissaka didn’t touch Elliot? 😅
How did Fernandez nearly miss
Dias = class
Liverpool can’t beat united this season
As a united fan you’ve got to thank Núñez for his inconsistency in front of goal 🙏
Mainoo 🌟
bruno's celebrating before mainoo's shot went in
I fancied Utd to win this.  They've had this pattern all season.
Arsenal fans happy :))
Can't wait for Klopp to leave and your 7 years of glory are over! Back to mid-table football where you belong hahahah.
Thank you united 🙏 Arsenal appreciates your efforts today❤️
Carragher's sigh on bruno's goal is bliss to hear
*THE SO CALLED CHAMPIONS ELECT* Still cannot beat one of the worst Man United teams in history 😂😂😂😂
Why is this chaos lol? United agenda at its finest
What is CHOAS?😂😂 well in sky
Anybody but sala will do a better job. I'm not talking about nunes he needs to be drop with the under 17 team where he gets used to the ball. The ball is around & not square someone can mention it though.
Gonna be a mint title race but ABC anyone but City!
Liverpool is not going to win the league 😢😢
Mainoo is one of a kind🥶
Congrats to Liverpool for bottling the league.
Liverpool play sloppy that's all I'm saying to hates
Tightens the title race up even more , 3 great teams separated by 1 point
Technically, as an Arsenal fan our toughest games are: Tottenham away, Chelsea home and Manu away. Given our record at OT, I'll take a draw. We just never win there. Plus tough UCL games to come. Bayern home and away, if we go through (IF), it's Mancity or Real Madrid (Home and away) and IF (a big IF) we go through it's a final to prep for while fighting for the league. (I have no idea what Arteta has in plan for this phase of the season) so it's safe to say Liverpoool are still very mucn in it! They can cruise through the Europa League because they have squad depth. And if anyone of us (Arsenal and Liverpool) slip, City could just go on a mad unbeaten run and it's curtains closed. In short, the league is still alive and kicking! But personally if we Arsenal keep our defence fit (Saliba and Gabriel M.) for this closing phase, then there is hope for that neutral who wants a different league champion haha!
Salah should’ve atleast scored one in the 1st half
The Celtic and rangers match  was well better
Gory gory manu could not snatch last minute winner during forgie time.
You can’t give it away in the 80 minute it’s ridiculous
Mainoo ! wow!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍💃🏻
That manioo goal
once avain an absolutely robbery of a decision againsg utd completely brushed over by sky  never in a millions years is that a penalty. ZERO contact. where the wall to wall coverage kf that pen decision? the entire season utd uave had a ridiculously amount against and it never gets covered
Brilliant game
Why spoil the result? Leave it a brief description
Best referee and var
Cracking again...
HAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAAHHAHAAHHAHAAHAHAHHAAHHAAHAHHAHAAHHAHAAHAHHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHHA Chelshit.
Gary's scream 😂😂
Well done Utd 😂😂😂
We threw away almost all the winning games just like that. We beat Liverpool fa cup and again we had a chance to beat them
The more your eyes are open,you can see these mistakes ie the misplaced Liverpool pass with the keeper being 10 miles off his line,Darwins miss,and Diaz's goal,with not a defender in sight of him,which i believe was saveable,are deliberate and the games are scripted and i stand on this.
How is that a peno he’d lost control of the ball before challenge fl
Klopp knows it, Merseyside knows it. They lost the league in Manchester.
TISSUES FOR THE KOPITES 😂😂😂😂😂    EFC
Kobbie has to be on the plane.
Sell Salah for the big money this summer and re-invest. Jota is terribly missed, he's the only true consistent finisher we have.  Biggest thing is that Kelleher was inches away from touching that ball and getting sent off, and that would have been game over for the title race. So in some ways I'm happy, but equally frustrated with how often we miss.
Bye klopp klopp 🚶🚶🚶🚶
mainoo is too dam good he truly is a superb youngster
Kobbie mainoo> Harvey elliot
Mainoos goal reminds me of machedas goal against aston villa
Credit to Fernandes to score from that far out when the ball is moving across your body is really NOT easy. He was shocking today otherwise. Willy Kambwala was superb.
I’ll be honest if United play like this against Arsenal it’s a rap. No way in hell Arsenal are missing all those chances United are a so easy to create chances against. Casemiros legs have gone aswell
Scousers losing their bottle, arsenal next. Blue moon 😅😅
I don't really understand why Salah is taking the penalties again, I thought that task belonged to Alexis MacAllister these days.
Liverpool trying everything not to win! 😅😂
Mainooooooo
Casemiro is ready for Saudi, and bruno is too Man united magically more energised when Rashford left. Coincidence?
Mo salah mo salah mo salah
Didn't need to try that challenge.
Ten Hag in, out, shake it all about
The League title is now Arsenal’s. Congratulations Arsenal 👏
After the recent pastings we got to enjoy, seems only fair United got to trash our season this year.
Salah got that Vegeta hairline💀
Funny how Klopp doesnt get booked for his sideline antics but Arteta does.
Ever Since Mane left, Liverpool are…..
0:13 Tan Haag shocked Onana saved a ball with his hands
Kobbie Maino should always play from the first minutes, he is a young, very talented boy who scores very beautiful goals, I am happy with him
Mainoo ❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
I am a Liverpool follower but great awareness and presence of mind from Bruno Fernandes to score like that.👏
Kambwala, mainoo and Dalot 🔥
who was here before they spelt “chaos” wrong
They don't show the angle that shows no contact on Elliott. The bias from SKY against United lets SKY down.
Nice dive by Elliot, not mentioned not reviewed. A game that wants rid of something when they don't know what it is!
That Was NEVER EVER A PENALTY... VAR ARE RESPONSIBLE  !!!
Klopp for the sack
Anthony Taylor, who comes from down the road from old trafford, should not be reffing Man Utd games. I do think he's a good ref but, man utd's win percentage is greater when he refs than any man utd manager has ever had, including fergie.   There is too much opportunity for foul play and the epl should be proactive rather than reactive on this issue.
Fernandez celebrates like he did something
I like Liverpool, but they're not good enough to be deserving of the title.
As expected it was 11 men vs 12.
Man united goals were top notch today Liverpool abit lucky
Liverpool bottled it 😂
I rlly wanted them to lose this but okay We're just one point below now
shows liverpool aint ss good we had 4 kids playing yet again still couldnt beat us had 12 injures lost 5 players in 2 games
'Glorious Chaos' should be up there with the likes of 'Whispering Death' for Sport's greatest nicknames.
Dominated the first half, had many chances but couldn't finish, we lost that game we didn't draw. Holding on to the ball for far too long seems to be our thing this season 🙄BUT.. we're still in with a shout. YNWA
Looked like a bad decision that penalty, and I'm neutral. The ball had gone he fell over
Nunez with an excellent clearance
The best result as far as other teams are concerned.
Arsenal win the league baby
Martin Tyler would be impossible to replace they said ? … step forward Peter Drury 🙌
Show the slow MO of that “penalty”! Go On
Liverpool are done
Not even gonna show the garnacho offside goal?
Quansah and van dijk wer not on form at all in the first half especially with the fernandes goal
Yet again were showing we will most definetley bottle the league like we did in 18/19 and 21/22 we draw tooooo many games how many chances do we need to kill a game off? Konate shud have started i dont know what hes done to jurgen klopp but he seems to be a fringe player, hes a tank i like quansah but big game like this konate shud have played, dont know if its just me but i never have confidence we can go ona run and win 8/10 games in a row, cus theres always gona be a few draws in there we love drawing games 18/19 21:22 we lost league cus of drawing and its going to happen again, been a liverpool fan is so painful sometimes i wish we just had that city mentality but we really dont these pundits like to think we have but we havent, we are actually bottle jobs most seasons.
2 games we fumble the by conceding a penalty
Well done Utd, from Sunderland!
Another free penalty for Liverpool, but their fans will pretend they get robbed every week. Shameless bunch.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
United defence 0.0.5  Not standard at all what is it
We always mess up a goal lead. It's happened to us all season(Manchester United fan)
Hopefully that draw is enough for the vermin to miss out on the title. The good people of the world want nothing more. ❤️
Yeah that team does not deserve to win the league genuinely don’t know how their better off this season than they were last.
Arsenal has the difficult fixtures of all three
Rigged league - Diaz offside, Odegaard handball and Doku penalty… what are Liverpool meant to do? We are playing against 19 teams and the entire PGMOL.
Lovely Onana save at the beginning
2:10 I hope your watching Southgate 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The commentator said beautiful chaos!
When will Liverpool EVER LEARN.  TOTAL DOMINANCE FIRST HALF AND NEARLY HALF OF THE 2ND HALF. ANY WONDER JURGEN KLOPP IS LEAVING.  THESE PEOPLE ON THE PUTCH WOULD DRIVE YOU INSANE.
That Mainoo goal looked like a classic Van Nistelrooy finish
Liverpool needing a penalty again 😂 got bossed before that 😚👌
Like everyone says, Arsenal can't win the title.   Hold my beer,,,,🍺
Draw or whatever. Just the goals from Bruno and Mainoo is a victory in itself.
Typical Liverpool. We destroyed them 2-2.
But but but Bruno ghosts against big teams 😡😡😡
That boy mainoo plays like/better than pogba at this age..he's guna be one of the best in the world
Good game from a Liverpool fan. The title is anyone’s now
Liverpool has lost the title
If there are any silver lining this season, we've had a decent season against Liverpool this season, in fact we've edged it I think.
I remember when United used to get penalties
My feelings exactly .onana has literally stepped up his game .if he's about improvement like that ,he will end up a monster in goal
6th.
Mainoo with an absolute worldie same for bruno and kambwala filled in for varane and was world class
Can’t make excuses for these forwards, so many chances and they don’t even hit the target. Every big game this happens
Every bloody time we give away a penalty 😡
I don't ever wanna hear harvey elliot or Lewis miley in the same sentence as mainoo ever again 😂
that kobbie mainoo goal was fire
Love it if this is the game that cost Liverpool the title. Absolutely awesome goals by Man Utd 👹👹👹
Warra game that was mainoo and Fernandez goals was out of this world 🔥🔥
gotta give credit to fernandez tho bruhh he actually delivered
Onana is crap
I placed a tenner on a draw thank you very much. Good day for me 😀
Horizontal Fernandes at his best again.
Man U are still Man U , but Liverpool looked shocking , looked like mid table at best.
Liverpool finishimg was woefull ...Can still see it going to the wire though  with all  three teams  in with a shout ...Good for the game .
Advantage Arsenal. 7 to go 😅
United vs 💩 teams:💩💩💩💩   United vs ✅🧠👀🫁👣:👍👍👍👍🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Fernandes goal was awesome
United were pretty much outclassed. The penalty cool as you like under so much pressure
We battered them
You expected from numerous as hard as he works but Dom and Bradley should hit faster
That  SALAH  penalty  going  in  was  precious   believe  you  me,   LFC  defeat   today  ...  title  gone,  to  me  anyway ,  now?   car'nt   call it.
Should have been out of sight first half. knew it would come back to bite us. Can't win titles playing like that.
United's cup final
YNWA Lads, We go again
What about the dive by Elliott , he initiated contact by leaving his leg dangling...
What a day to be an arsenal fan🤷🏻‍♂️
Twice Man U have done this could had won both games
ten Hag vs Klopp  EtH - 2 wins (1 knocking Liverpool out of the FA Cup) Klopp - 1 win Both - 1 draw  And EtH beat Klopp for the Bangkok Cup too 😂
Ten out of ten! What’s he supposed to do, Rashford, rubbish, Bruno, apart from the goal, shocking, Rasmussen, no service, Casemiro, awful and almost costly. Mainoo, with a better player beside him will flourish into a stunning 8. Kambwala, with Harry Maguire beside him was exceptional. Give this manager time and a decent structure, we could be going somewhere. Stick with these tools down players and lose the manager, we are going to see another ten years of mediocrity.
Thanks u so much United it’s been a pleasure doing business with u 🤝
I know I incredibly frustrating but softened that we didn't lose
That’s never a penalty and we have the PGMOL making these errors in the closest title race in YEARS. Honestly it blows my mind how they are allowed to influence the table. Arsenal should be 2 points CLEAR
Salah was not cooking today
I said at half time even hope it was obvious 2 Nil games over one nail incredibly dangerous
It is not apocalyptic It will have a Long Point for the Arsenal and I have to play Champions league
It’s irrelevant tho Utd can’t finish top 4. Utd fans should boycott going to the last few games old Trafford.
Arsenal deserve to win the league. They have been the best team overall this season and have played the most attractive football.
whenever liverpool in title race they drop points against small teams 😝. how can they make such a errors and miss chances.
How is Peter Drury still working for Sky? All he does is shout out the players name, his commentary is awful
Diaz has some shocking finishing
Mainoo’s finish 👌
There should not of been a plenty
Never a Pen!!!
I love mo salah
That’s Liverpool’s chance of the premier league title gone.😢
Salah penalty looks like I'm playing fc24 they got the run up to perfection
Fantastic game. Thank you Utd for keeping arsenal top ⬆️
how many more pens is united going to give away to bottle a match lol
SLIP SLIP SLIP! Can the RedShite grab defeat from the jaws of victory again? LETS HOPE SO! UTFT💙💙💙
0:30 how ya missin
I thought the Bruno goal was a belter until young Kobbie stepped up !! HIs price tag just goes up and up !! Imagine if that point stops Liverpool winning the title !!
0:30
What a game
Neville for mainooos goal ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhjj 😂😂😂
Peter Drury is so cringe. He sounds like a robot trying to figure out what a human thinks when they get excited
IT'S ALWAYS MAN UNITED SPOILS LIVERPOOL'S GAME. BUT LIVERPOOL WILL BE CHAMPS THIS SEASON ANYWAY.
Liverpool have road their luck at times this season. They thrive in the Chaos and usually come out on top bevause of how good they are up top. However when you allow a lot of chances against you, and you dont score you can drop points which is what theyve done against all the big teams
What happens to Liverpool when they are fighting for the league title .from Gerards slip to now this woeful pass .Man Utd are terrible should have been 4 up at half time .the little African lad is a good player but rest are terrible .
Love how they changed chaos to chaos😂😂😂 classic sky sports
Man Utd gave this game away.
how did liverpool not win that
The result is not good, but it's a point with Manchester United and we need to understand the players playing every 3 days with that intensity is not easy. Arsenal is going to lose points anyway
Liverpool average team
Liverpool can not win the league
I feel Salah is holding Liverpool back - when he was away at AFCON and for his injury period it felt like the team played with a bit more freedom and maybe didn't defer to the great man's presence on the pitch. Harvey Elliot in particular played like he had a weight lifted off his shoulders when Salah was out he grew as a player, seems to have gone back into his shell a little since.
We’ve gotten two all time classic Liverpool vs United matches this season
Liverpool should have had the game won in the first half. Criminal missed chances
So poor from Salah today
All i am saying is yes shots against man u is not good but again football is based on points and we done good today to get a draw because we could of got buried
I can't believe mainoo scored his second goal for man United against Liverpool
It’s a good day for Arsenal fans Top of the league 🎉
If we win the league, give Mainoo Cedric’s medal.
So where was the "CHAOS" mentioned in the video's hyperbolic title?
Not sure why ibrahima was on the bench
Liverpool pretty much lost this game after all their chances
From a Liverpool supporter we played shocking today even tho we had the possesion and the chances the defending was terrible really don't know why klopp didn't start with konate would've made the game alot easier for us quansah isn't fully there yet.
What chance has any utd manager got when your senior players are consistently putting in 3/10s and your defence is butchered all season by injuries ....casemiro bruno & Rashford in particular have been so poor this season.....the positives for utd are we've got some cracking youngster's coming through plus our youth teams are ripping it up ..... sell varane awb casemiro mctomminy Rashford & sancho this summer & there's about 150 million plus another 1.5 mill a week off the books in wages & reinvest it  properly & man utd could be a brilliant team again because all season we've been proper shite mate 😂.....
Nunez is tosh
KOBBEE MAINOO
Liverpool cut their own throats yet again. 🙄
How did they not put Garnacho offside goal
The Liverpool players are not ready. You can't be missing so many chances like that...
Liverpool don't deserve to win the title, not good enough when push comes to shove as one would say. Arsenal and Man City fight now. Liverpool are flirters and can do one!
This won’t get more then 100 likes 😢
Crazy game! United could’ve won it at the death
Another gifted penalty
Utd fans are as loud as they are silent.
I hope that stops Liverpool 😂
Utd are super shite liverpool should of beaten them
No way was that a penalty. Tried to put a leg across, to clear the ball, missed and dude goes over non active leg. Sold ref a dud. Worked😢
Never a penalty not even in Sunday league
ARSENAL
Brunos goal is actually pretty straightforward, just needed enough pace on it to get there but its basically an open net
Liverpool needing 2 set peices to score😂😂😂😂.
What Chaos? It was simply a game of Football ( just asking/saying ) Peace to all.
Kobbie is one special player
As a Liverpool fc fan I want arsenal to win the league if not Liverpool after watching this game ! We’ve been pretty wasteful ! This game would’ve decided who the winner is but now  not only we have to win rest of the matches but also depend on next matches of Man city/Arsenal !
Congrats Manchester City for winning the premier league 🎉
Beyond frustrating
Can we just all appreciate that Uniteds games are not boring, always the unexpected and entertaining.
Kobbie Mainoo is HIM!!
Thanks Man utd
That's still 7 points dropped from leading positions. Absolute shambles
I was there
STOP! lets get this right, UTD go battered, LFC did not take their chances. Silly mistake & good vision from Bruno for the 1st , UTD second goal was class respect, LFC get a obvious pen, but disappointing from such a dominant LFC performance. LFC should rue the chances missed again.
JustNhy
Threw it away Fa cup and threw this wont win the premiership now
liverpool got saved by a penalty
This bloke must be the worst commentator I have heard, he screams , perhaps he should go over to women's football
How stupid of Bissaka. Throwing yourself inside the box, waw
Rival fans that claim Bruno and Mainoo are overrated must be enjoying eating that humble pie today
Hi
is this champions league final ?
Really pushing this CHAOS message
Liverpool blew it. Wont win the league now. Let Klopp down
liVARpool cant even beat a bad United team Hahaha
Crazy how liverpool absolutely dominated man united yet barely scraped a draw what is that finishing lmao
Harvey Eliots leg went stiff, and bought a soft pen
CHSOA
Peter Drury is, day by day, getting more insufferable.   He is still the best we currently have but, my god he tries so hard at times.
Gutted we did nt get the three points here - Mint goals by Bruno and Mainoo on the turn though.
First choice defence missing every single game and people still want Man Utd to play good football 😭. Let Arsenal miss Saliba, Gabriel and white and see how they do. Let Liverpool miss Van Dijk, Robertson and Trent all at once and see how they do.
What CHAOS?
Onana is WORLD CLASS!
Nice dive for the pen
Think u mu
Klippity Klopp bottling the title. Leaves the prem with the one ghost title
Ten Haag couldn’t believe that save he looked so confused loool
Shocking defending by Bissaka. Elliot was going away from goal and he needlessly dives in??? 🙄
And now its open playing field for top three! Who stays, who slips and who misses by their finger tips! This will be one hell of a end of the season indeed!
Giving the ball away like that needs sacking
I  think they just gave the title to Arsenal. Credit to ManU for going ManO  y ManO
Man City 4 Peat Pending?
Lucky  again
Needed the win, arsenal will win the league 😊
Best game in 10 years. Improving on Liverpool is a good sign
Crazy how talented Mainoo is at 18
How many goals does Onana want to let in over the season he’s already conceded atleast 90 this season he’s not good enough and liverpools stand in is just as bad they won’t win the league with him in goal
No chick fill-a sauce?
Kambwala. What a performance 👏🏻👏🏻🔥
Qansah's just had his slippy G moment 😬
Not show the UTD offside goal in first couple minutes if that counts UTD win
1:16 ughhhhhhhhh😂😂😂😂
Kobbie Mainoo take a bow 🤩
2:06 You can hear Neville's celebration in the distant background and it has me in wrinkles 😂😂😂😂😂
Man United have something to be proud about (not 7-0)
Say goodbye to the title Liverpool
Onana made a great save in the first clip. Diaz having a crazy technique to score. Bruno’s goal was crazy. Manioo curve to score was mad. Salah missing an open goal. Salah get his redemption with a pen. CRAZY GAME ONCE AGAIN!
No way it’s a penalty at the end of the game….
That penalty is a joke
Liverpool bottle it once again
Arsenal, be happy. Liverpool just handed over the key to you.     Arsenal, you're in the test of pass marks 100. You can't afford even a single draw. Not because Liverpool r equal on points. But due to Manchester City r chasing you with their easiest league fixtures compered to your league fixtures.     Destiny has put Arsenal in decisive position 2nd time in this season after winning 'Christmas League' back to back.
second game in a row take of Nacho conceded a pen
Not a bad result for City
Quansah might be unexpierenced but cant let him off with that, schools kids would know better
On that lob the keeper touches it should be a red card where is var
Arsenal or city will win the title now.
Casemiro needs to retire man.... He ain't him no more.
That Bruno goal reminds me of that McTomminay screamer against us in 2021 only it wasn't the keeper's fault
Need Jota & Trent  back badly have to win need 100% consontration at this level awful pass
Yet again a clumsy tackle in the box cost them, can’t hold a lead to save their lives.
Best Liverpool Team in 30 years couldn’t beat the worse United Team in 30 years 😅😔3 times
Why was Kelleher 16 miles off his goaline🤔🤔🧐
AWB absolutely ridiculous. No need to tackle in the box. Also, I felt he was always left behind on Liverpool attacks. Not attacking properly, not defending properly. I know LB is not his position but come on man! You can’t be laggy this much all game! Also, I feel like we should sell Casemiro this summer while we can cash on him.
gary's scream in the distance when mainoo scored is goldne
Dropped 2 points. Game should of been over at half time
Mainoo's goal reminds me of  kiko Macheda's goal against Aston Villa
Bo
Cant even hold onto a lead to save our life
What a save by the utd keeper at the start wow 👌
Nunez not squaring that cut back to make it 2-1 is criminal 1:48
Great assist from Quansah
As a Liveepool fan ,can't complain, joint with arsenal, 1 point ahead of city and Ten Hag is STAYING! so I'll take it.
Good Result for United and Arsenal for now.
We can't keep shooting ourselves in the foot. If we are not having to come from behind we are giving away soft goals. Twice we should have left Old Trafford with a win.
Did any of you so called United fans go to the Match? Doubt it!
Thanks to both teams for saving me electric
Man united - OFFICIALLY worse team in top 5 leagues.   How can they be peppered smashed shots on and off target against them more than Sheffield united, Almeria 😂 sack the whole club please
I knew UTD would bottle it. But hey Drop point for Liverpool, Cmon Arsenal!
Liverpool this season need at least 20 shots to score 1 goal every one knows.
Lucky Man U. LFC was all over them.
Terrible penalty call but you can’t win them all
Ahh frustrating had the game at 2-1 and bloody daft penalty conceded. Mainoo talent is ridiculous
Every one talking about Cara moaning if you listen closely you can hear nev screeching in the background after mainoos goal 😂 time stamp 2.15-2.18
new pen cam is nice
We can't leave till other teams do us a favour. Got to be more clinical in front of goal 😢
Im a Man Utd fan but i think LFC deserve to win the league for Klopp
Neutral, boaring game all these so called big games are no good best games this season has been teams outside top 6 fact
Forget the wrong VAR decisions going against us this season, we'll be our own downfall for not winning the league this season. Against City and now today we had so many chances to win but our ruthlessness and clinical play has gone out the window
Those 2 united goals were class.
why is HARRY MAGUIRE still playing for man u?
Rashford is witnessing his young team mate Mainoo eclipsing him and that can’t be good for his confidence. I could be wrong. So Rashford prove me wrong by scoring more between now and end of the season. On another topic: Why do goal keepers move far to early trying to anticipate instead of holding themselves till the very last second before the pen taker kicks the ball? Not rocket science but what do I know.😂😂
Was it 60 shots in 2 games against united in the league. Thats crazy.
No penalty could see in reply there was no contact clear dive. Liverpool are just Hollywood football Any team that ACTUALLY get at them can beat them easy
How about showing that dive from the proper angle.
Joke we just lost the league
Szbozslai has been so underwhelming this season
Neville’s celebrating when it hits the net hahahaha
Unite United
Sign on, sign on, with no hope in your heart, cause you’ll never get a job You’ll never get a job! Sign on, sign on, with no hope in your heart
Bottled
Charagher sickening with his bias 😂😂
Come on arsenal
2:20 I saw that face in one of my nightmare's once.
Proper Barclays
Manioo's goal reminds me of Macheda against Villa way back in 2009
Get thiago motta in charge next season please
where's the chaos?
Hehe
Willy Kambwala..... Excellent performance..... Kid didn't put a foot wrong for his 2nd start as a United player.❤❤❤
lucky escape for liverpool
Why Klopp is picking the young boy over Konate is crazy. And lets stop celebrating Nunez because he runs around. He is shite
Neville's scream after mainoo scores :o
1:17 Scoring a Power Shot in FC 24 be like
Darwin nunes can score from his own box but he can't score a tap in btw I am s liverpool fan aswell
United are a bunch of burgers why do they always play well vs us
salah scores a penalty, commentator: "MOooo SALaaah Riiises"
Show a proper replay of the kid diving
Dear LFC fans,  Let's remain grateful and appreciative for another competitive LFC season thus far and continue to show your support and anticipation for the passion and excitement that Klopp and his team will demonstrate in the remaining games of the season.  Share this message with any LFC fan who appears to be negative or suppressive in their comments.
Ran all over city and united and should have had both of them buried by halftime but didn't take the chances. This will be the undoing, there will be no title because of performances like this.
Asenal were the real winners  today
Called it a draw because Liverpool's finishes are hella lacking and has always rely on comeback and late wins now.
I believe in a Liverpool crumble 🤞🏻 come on city champions mentality 💪🏻🔵
why did liverpool copy their mid-1990s spice boys away kit?!
Now you know why Alonso never came
The shining light for the moment for UTD is that amazing talent in midfield. What a player he could turn out to be
AWB, Maguire and Rashford all have to go, they are so useless, also its criminal how no ones mentioning Kambwalla, he was class this game, him and Dalot carrying the defence
Yanated yanted
Mainoo is on fire 🔥
Good performance from Man Utd. Once they sort out their defence they'll be golden.
United were dreadful but Liverpool cannot finish chances. Disgraceful performance by both teams.
Unbelievable.  YNWA
What a game -  Liverpool had so many chances & just unable to be clinical in finding the goals "Absolutely Frustrating for Liverpool Fans"  & that could be there undoing towards the end of the season .. But Mainoo for Man Utd was superb .. It was, however, a thoroughly entertaining game ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Utd could have won it again
Mainoo is so good, a young player who doesn't rely on pace and physicality, just pure skill. He might be the best midfield talent weve seen in years
This united tea will never win a league as can’t get themselves up for most games and were totally outplayed today.
Kobbie take a bow. This kid is special.
Jamie Carragher giving out Quansah giving the ball to bruno for the man utd win was comedy gold 😂😂
not a fricking pen.😊
Seeing bunch of Arsenal fans getting excited ..why. if not us it's city. Calm down
Lucky Liverpool did not lose to United again. Imagine full 3 points to United Klopp would have left Liverpool early before the end of the Season.😂.
I don't wanna say it, but I have no choice....VVD may have cost us the title.
Even a win for utd don't mean a great deal apart from chucking a spanner in Liverpool's title works, cos we're not getting champions league football anyway 😕
Amazing game 🙂
United has 2 seasons to start challenging for the league. Otherwise, Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo are off to La Liga
WHAT A GAME
Salah was honestly maybe the worst player on the pitch. How many chances do you need to finally take one?
Timid stuff compared to rangers v celtic
How is nobody talking about Kambwalas amazing performance?
Mainoo’s goal reminds me Frederico macheda’s goal back in the day
United had the worst defence in the past 10 years.
Everyone saying Liverpool have bottled it, there still 7 games left
I think the title is going to arsenal this year
Thanks from Arsenal
Brilliant goal from mainoo kid’s got a bright future ahead of him 👏
Quansah and his non league performance has cost us the league! How much money is he on? Quansah and Karius cut from the same cloth?
As a professional footballer how can you give such a careless penalty away.
It's really sad when a "big" team like man United is relaying on a youth like maino for break through lol 😂😂😂
I was there
As a United fan I'll take the draw ❤❤❤
Man U have thrown the games away in recent weeks!
I think Liverpool’s problem is with their front three. Diaz never takes his man on, Nunez is a klutz and Salah is far from the player he was.
Game, set and Match Arsenal.
Just watch Southgate start Henderson over Mainoo🙃
The man united pitch is horrible
United lucky as usual , Liverpool poor finishing once again losing them well needed points , frustraiting to watch after dominated most of the game , why was Salah on the pitch ubtill end of the game I will never know.
Sadly Liverpool failed to take their numerous chances. Oh well, there’s always next year I suppose……
I think Man U are catching up to Liverpool last match 4 3 man u now 2 2
Salah has fade since mane left
Liverpool still yet to be Man U glad to see it
Liverpool should've won easily but not winning when it matters most is what's cost them titles
And once again man utd bottle by giving a penalty
Its over for Liverpool title has gone man city are ruthless they will take it away
Perfect result for arsenal it’s a result in there fevers
Salah is elite level
1:17 that moan lol🤣
Lucky very very very lucky Liverpool. Just lucky lucky lucky lucky.  Same like Chelsea last game. Exactly same. Glory Glory Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson forever ❤. Greetings from Leicester. Godbless lovely Manchester United FOREVER ❤.
Man who’s going to help Nunez. Lace that first time with venom not side foot it. 😂. Come On My Gooners. Onto Bayern we match! 🥶
Incredible goal from Mainoo  Was absent all game but pulls out the top draw 🔥
Brunos goal was beutiful
Kobbie Mainoo is the next maradona
Poor finishing and sloppy defending. I have no sympathy for my team!
Another one Liverpool threw away. Too many this season.
Another example of how painfully overrated Nunez is by scousers
Utd got a couple of quality players, quite a few average players but has a team it's the worst I've seen since fergie left. They are all over the place, schoolboy defending & zero organisation.
For Gerrard Slip, see Quansah Pass....
Liverpool got themselves to blame.
the commentary at 1:20 is just wow i think strained his throat
Oh ya not gonna show the Casemiro challenge at the end of the game which was only a yellow jones got a red for lesss
You want to blame Onana again?
Advantage Arsenal now
Nunez gonna cost Liverpool that title 😂
Klipperty Klopps bus wheels coming off??
After dumping them out of the FA cup lets hope Man U have stopped them getting a title. Universally despised!!
It’s chaos not chaos 🥴😂
Knocked em out of the cup and out of the league, over to you Atlanta
When is Jota coming back.
You got to give him a break, it was obviously wan bissaka's first time playing football.
Liverpool wes good day  john
united not even deserve one goal they shud av let Liverpool win
Kambwala was a nice surprise! Strong and quick good awareness, hopefully he will get more game time
Never touched him 4 the penalty
Far from clinical Lpool
We should have won 6-2
Ben-alty! Itsa Ben-alty!
Game was so choatic werent it
this is why i hate losing a game it's all Cahos..
Defensively again a shambles both goals should've been avoided
Liverpool supporter. We knew Liverpolol couldn't afford another wasteful, sloppy performance at Old Trafford. They were fortunate to get a draw, given how wayward their shooting was. United very poor at times, but two flashes of pure talent and it's a draw.
I'll take the point, but there's work to be done in the summer....
Still waiting to view the chaos
Man utd getting 2 draws and a win against Liverpool this season is insane.
Gutted with the result
WE CANT EFFORD TO GET A DRW WE LIVERPOOL TEAM NEED TO WIN EVERY GAMES
Far too wasteful, should have been put to bed before halftime. Liverpool shooting themselves in the foot again.  After watching Arsenal and city yesterday, they both look like winning every game. I fancy arsenal to win the title. Man City are 2nd favourites.  And as a Liverpool fan, I hate to say it but I think we have blown it.
Looks like man City will win the league again arsenal won't Liverpool won't
I wonder when united will concede an ACTUAL penalty, not a dive
Who's going 2 win the league now?
So careless from AWB, there were 4 other defenders ready to tackle Elliot. Mistakes were made on both sides, but this could cost Liverpool the league.
Another papering over the cracks result for United
That is never a penalty
Choas 💀
We don't even deserve the title any more. You can see the panic and hot potato behaviour whenever we're in the opponent's box. Just take the shot?! Was the exact same in the FA Cup; embarrassing.
Liverpool attackers absolutely bottled it today😂😂😂
Liverpool saved by a late penalty 🤣🤣🤣
Liverpool should have had the game sewn up by halftime...14 shots to zero.
Mainoo’s mums a bike if that’s good news for anyone
Never a penalty.. was a dive.
Mainoo a man of wonder!
CHOAS😂😂
CHOAS stands for: Cannot Have Obscene Anfield Scoreline  CHOAS at Old Trafford
Liverpools gung ho football isn't sustainable
I wonder if Carra will criticise his team 😂
Maybe we can still win the title, all we need is for every Arsenal and City player to forget how to walk for the next month or so
Kobbie Mainoo..... Like Andy Grey will say that GOAL...... TAKE A BOW SON❤❤❤....... PURE CLASS..... What a quality player.❤❤❤
Arsenal to win the league 🎉
We're so wasteful on chances. We could been 3 or 4 nil up before half time but just can't seem to ever finish anything.
Liverpool was doing better with  kids
That was a dive all day long, we got robbed. Liverpool conned the referee for the penalty. It really sucks..... Wan Bissaka never touched him one bit.
Will always believe in this club  Just build around the youngsters  and rebuild this club from top to bottom  ETH IN Yanited ❤
Mainoo and Kambwala are solid for such young lads. Great potential
Crazy
Good effort utd. (Arsenal fans)
YEAH, HELL YEAH BABY TOP OF THE TABLE
ABSOLUTE CHOAS
WHERE was United's defence for Liverpool's opener? Not 1 within touching distance of him still a great finish. THEN ANOTHER really sloppy piece of defending this time from Liverpool for United's opener...can only imagine what was said at half time BUT for the neutral fans it makes for great viewing the last 2 matches between United & Liverpool at Old Trafford have been incredible 👏**
Thank you, Sincerely, Arsenal FC
How did Liverpool manage not to win this game. I wonder gave away the first goal lots of chances and still managed a draw
Kelleher would have been sent off if he'd got a hand to Fernandes' goal. Probably for the best he didn't!
That point could be the difference between winning and losing the title! Believe.. YNWA
Thats that for Liverpool now. City will be ruthless now they see Liverpool cracking under the pressure.
Who cant believe the "choas" at old trafford
If Liverpool miss out on the title by 1 or 2 points, my happiness will be immeasurable
We may have Drew but I'll take that. What happened to hammering Utd again Liverpool? 3 games couldn't beat one of the worst Utd sides since 1992 in 3 games 🤣🤣🤣
We couldn't hold on again. Mufc66
Choas
on another day Liverpool would have won that 6 or 7 papers over the cracks for man.u they were battered again
Remember Man City 0-0 Arsenal when Liverpool were celebrating? Lol.
Hoi  manutd 32to day at old Trafford for it they
lucky liverpool
This comment won’t get more than 20 likes
We need Jota back because the finishing is so horrendous. People can have a go at Nunez but Salah’s the one we need to be talking about. How does he keep on missing easy chances and to top it off, he just spams wide passes which are hard to work with. Diaz is electric but his finishing is off. Look at Mainoo, he was in a difficult spot but managed to score. It’s like they’ve no chemistry. Klopp should actually give them a slap because this isn’t it. From a fake quadruple to basically only a double and just because just like the FA cup game they couldn’t finish.
Ten Hag in! He will turn the young players into superstars. Thank you for putting the belief and trust in Kobbie, Garnacho and today young Willy Kambwala. 🔴
Carragher made that noice again 😂
I’m an Arsenal fan, but that doesn’t matter, what a goal by Mainoo!!
So bad💀💀
It’s unbelievable how Man Utd have had so much luck this season, an average team that there ridiculous standing in the premiership makes false reading. 12th would look about right.
United should've won this game.
Nunez is so overrated it's unreal
COYG <3 On to the next!.
mainoo’s goal was fabulous 🔥
Bruno’s goal was incredible. Thank god Liverpool won’t win the league now
Haha liverpoo bottling it😂
chaos?
Some finish from Mainoo, definitely one for the future
Liverpool’s finishing in front of goal is criminally bad
Well done United I will take a draw 😅
Liverpool needs to focus more. Unbelievable how we did not win today.
Aaron never misses a slide tackle unfortunate for us today
Absolute bottle job! 5pt lead now blown. Game should have been done and dusted by half-time and then they go and concede from Utd's very first effort on goal. If Arsenal put that performance in today they'd get ripped apart!
Worst away crowd at old Trafford, on the contrary Old Trafford was booming in the 2nd half
Scousers  be fumin 😂😂😂
Let’s go United  Hopefully arsenal can get the title
A fair result, but go on the Red Devils
Horrific penalty. Never touched a Elliot, FA just had to make sure the Klopp farewell party kept on going
Man city will win the premier league 💯
Jota would have finished some of the opportunities we had today. We gifted man.utd a goal and gave them encouragement.  We got to be more clinical
United, perhaps I spoke about you too harshly. Well done! (except you AWB, no well done to you) COYG
I knew we weren’t winning. Stop getting my hopes up about winning the league, scumchester have bought it again.
Bro Bruno is sooo pisstaking, I want to see mount starting over this guy and rashford aswell. He's PR thing needs to stop.
Bruno's goal tho, first time hit 😮
Wan bissaka is still only a palace quality full back. He shouldn’t be anywhere near this team.
For the first time in 10 years I have hope for United. What will solve our problems?  The youth.
Amazing how a player scoring in a game makes everyone think someone had a great game. But on other hand, harvey elliott needs to be starting for liverpool, as a liverpool fan i was never on the szoboslai hype train, decent  player but not as good as everyone made out at start of season. And curtis jones back to being curtis jones and holding onto ball for to long. Dont know if he passed to teammate when he came on. And nunez who i am huge fan and love him, his decision making was shocking. Anyway,  onto atalanta then palace. Shows how mighty have fallen, utds biggest achievement of season will be putting dent in liverpool title chances.
For the third time, in just 2 games & 3 days, Manchester United have a ludicrous penalty awarded against them. Not one of them actually a penalty.  On a side note - Kobbie Mainoo walks into Liverpools midfield. World class talent.
Mainoo’s goal almost identical to KDB, special talent.
Thanks United, at least for now
It’s CHOAS folks!!! Absolute choas!!!!
Neville: "OoOoH!" Carragher: "Uuhooggh!"  Amazing commentary.
Loved how Kelleher dived for Bruno's goal. So far out of his box that he'd have had a straight red.
We shouldn’t have been even close to being in this game at half time. Same happened in the cup, they should’ve been 5-1 up going into the last 10 of that tie. This fixture can do daft things to even the best. Fair play to us, we were actually clinical for once today after staying in the game but if you’re Liverpool, 2-1 down with 6-7 mins to go or not, this is definitely 2 points dropped
So yous can put this game up 5 mins after the game but no the old firm?
Problem with LIVERPOOL is we can't finish a game off Plain and simple.
absolute choas
Liverpool full of huff but no puff.   United no huff but full of puff.  That game sums up MU of late.  Also probably sums up Liverpool, wasteful.    Biggest miss has been Jota.
What a game as a Man U fan!
Liverpool throwing it again. Said before the game, Gomez should have started next to Virgil. Need Jota and Trent back badly.
'Glorious Chaos' Dear Mr Drury, you've done it again.
Never a pen
i hope quansah's goal for man u cost liverpool the leaque
Why was Fernando celebrating from a mistake by an opposition player and then the keeper being miles off his line , I could understand if it was a 10 pass goal but it was a mistake and he celebrates like it was goal of the century
😢😢😢😢What happened liverpool
STOP. SLIDING. IN. THE. BOX. 😖
CHAOS at Sky Sports as employee spells it 'CHOAS'
United goals were amazing.
Bro they spelled chaos wrong
Another example of why Liverpool won’t win the league.  Absolutely ridiculous how many chances they miss!  Nunez, Salah, Diaz, Dom all with poor decision making.
Every arsenal and Man City fan are united fans today 😂😂
No one talks about how many chances salah misses
tbf these results are far better than last season
50 minutes for a first shot is insane
Bin dip bottle jobs 😂
A friendly reminder Liverpool won the same amount of PL titles as Blackburn and Leicester. Klopp farewell tour, eh?
What a second half 👏....no tactics,  no shape ... just carnage
So annoyed 😤🤬 Really wanted Man Utd to Win‼️
Hey Sky use spell check on your titles.
I take city to win the title sorry the other 2
This was a must win!!!! We lost 2 points!!!
Choas theory right there in the title!! 😂
Thank you Yanited! Arsenal fan!
United celebrating a point at home and Liverpool disappointed with a point away. Shows the levels between the sides, but Liverpool were wasteful and only have themselves to blame for not taking the 3 points  Gonna be tricky now to win the title but it’s not over yet
Ahh its spelt Chaos @SkySportsPremierLeague lol 😂
Diaz made ima a beg on his knees
Great lack of highlights there
Liverpool dominated from start to finish but bottled it in front of goal. Salah 3 Nunez 3 Diaz 4
Great game just mad...Great stuff, utd showed some pride in second half.....utd are happier than pool that's for sure
Absolute choas
Same old story Liverpool getting loads off chance. S and not putting them away.
Good game tbf
Imagine the points tally if Liverpool weren’t playing at 70% strength all season💀💀
Liverpool not winning is a win for football
Man u scared of leading games now
And they’ve just lost the trophy again 😂
If the season ends on goal difference this is the game that done it!
If the goalie had got a touch to that Fernandes shot, he'd have been sent off
Choas 😂😂😂
City will go on to win it now.
Ah yes my favourite word “CHOAS”😂.
As an arsenal fan I agree
Hope they both kicked each other off the park.
Big miss for Liverpool should have scored 6 against a real average team.
Don’t blame jarell at all he shouldn’t of started a game of that magnitude when two fit defenders were on the bench and more exp. Guess what? He made a rookie mistake because he still is. Just poor from Klopp like really poor and the experiment with constantly playing Salah now has to end because this decision making of his every game shows he’s deffo waned.
Tenhag finally ended klopps era 👍🏽
Peter drury commentary has got old very quick, like a kid commentating on his own game of fifa
The one thing united being so up and down is you'll more than likely get an entertaining game
People are saying maino played bad but from these highlights he looks like a superstar 😅😂
What a goal by Fernandes kelehar was lucky not to get a hand on it or he would be gone
Tightest title race in a very long time.
Lovely miss by Salah near the end
OH MY DAYS THIS MATCH WAS UNBELIEVABLE EVEN BRUNO PENANDES SCORING.🤯.
Oh we love CHOAS at Old Trafford 😂😂☠️☠️   Like If You Were Here When It Was Misspelt
The infamous Gary Neville squeak
Mainoo is in a league of his own. Klopp's face 🤣
As a Gooner il take this result😅
back Ten Hag!!!
we dont take are chances again and they get a point they do not deserve. footy is cruel.  onwards we go......NEVER GIVE UP (LIVERPOOL) YNWA.
The  CHOAS WAS CHOASING
We didn’t deserve to win but that is never a pen, so many times this season
Probably a fair result when u weigh it all up
as an arsenal fan, im delighted
Liverpool far too chaotic and inefficient, not enough control compared to City and Arsenal who I wouldn't be surprised to see win every game now.   As for Man Utd, it's so weird after growing up under their dominant 90s and 2000s era to see them as essentially 'mid table spoilers' now, but that's what they are. They're miles away from even competing for the league
A few things from today:  1. Klopp needs to bring subs on quicker, salah should NOT have stayed on 2. Elliot has to start over Szobo 3. Szobo needs to work on his passes 4. Salah has been god awful since AFCON 5. Quansah shouldn’t be blamed for, everyone in the team should be blamed for a horrid performance 6. Macca, I can’t thank you enough for being our only good player recently 7. JOTA COME BACK PLEASE YOURE OUR ONLY HOPE
For all those that said Arteta messed up not going for the win away to city. Suck on that.  Never punished
Only time im a united fan
real *choas* indeed.
Mainoo goal was a beauty to watch even though i ain’t a fan of man united
my boy mainoo
Liverpool just throwing it away
Dunno how Hojlund survived 3 substitutions. Should have come off for diallo. Mainoo should've stayed on. United played too defensive after 2-1. Diallo would've kept the ball up the pitch as well as creating chances. Mount can only strike. Also better to lose the ball in there half than in your own box. Liverpool weren't short of shots. Also Liverpool in possession, United back off. And when United are in possession Liverpool pressure and regain the ball.
"CHOAS"
do liverpool's forwards just close their eyes and hit and hope? Absolutely abysmal finishing again and quansah's moment will go down alongside gerrards slip dont deserve to win anything
Sorry but manioo goal how the hell is it a screamer, it’s a good goal but it’s not a screamer, he’s literally in the box
Never a pen
U cant stop worldy goals. LFC did well to salvage a point from defeat at its only bogey ground. Mainoo's gotta go to Euro's & help Southgate end the 58 years drought for England. We have the best midfield in the world with Jude, Declan & Kobbie.
What was wan bissaka doing going in for that tackle
As a uniyted supproter that one was an actualy pen this time 😂😂😂😂
The defending for both United goals was a shambles, awful ball from Quansah, Kelleher should’ve seen it the second Quansah played the ball.  Salah was a ghost bar his pen Jones takes too long on the ball Nunez just worked hard all game, didn’t do anything else And Robbos crossing was crap Poor performance all around, if Arsenal keep their heads they’ve won the league.
United going in the right direction a couple more season’s and they will be back to battering Liverpool.
Mainoo😮‍💨
On behalf of all arsenal fans. Thank you Kobbie Mainoo
Man utd need scotsmen at the helm. Thats when the legendary times happen. Same with liverpool.
What a strike by Fernandes
As an Arsenal fan, thank you Man U
That Mainoo goal was world class
Also I’m not even a. United fan but Onana has been incredible recently (I’m Not gonna tell u what team I support To avoid hate)
Mainoo is moving world class already 🤦🏾‍♂️ Reminds me of a younger Saka slyly. I don't know what Ten Hag was thinking taking him off, the attack died immediately 😂. If he stayed on, they would have scored again.
Salah was shocking but I’m glad he scored
That fernandes goal 🥶
April goal of month gonna be tough & not even 10 days in - kdb yesterday, alexis for lfc vs Sheffield United & either one of United’s goals today
love a bit of choas
blatant dive for the second Liverpool goal. Scandalous.
Arsenal are not winning nothing,you have the most horrendous run in,it's a straight shoot out between Liverpool and city,as for the kid mainoo,he did nothing all game,but dosent need to,when you can finish like pele!
If we don’t start talking about buying defender before any other player we will never win the anything.
Klopp has bottled it AGAIN
Massive 2 points dropped by liverwho
Kobby Maino is the man 😊
Wow there was loads of CHOAS in that game
Liverpool were robbed
Liverpool 😂😂😂😂
Liverpool players showed Mainoo so much respect they know the kid is a BALLER hence why they gave him space to DUMP on them 😅 what a Sexy goal from Mainoo👏
Cos of living no joke these on millions don’t get to emotional
Man Utd fluking a draw, typical garbage from the flukers lead by Ten Haggle
Liverpool players have to hit the target from 4 yards out. Probably another rigged game.
Poor game management and composure… from Klopp… let’s see him/Liverpool avoid all criticism despite going into the game as MASSSIVE favourites against a terrible United team.
That equalising pen a bit dodgy he fell over his foot but I think the pl are engineering the result of the title for arsenal to win it afterall they're getting away with a lot of dirty stuff on the field
what a goal by mainoo
After that fernandes goal and Mainoo screamer we were robbed. No way on earth did Liver deserve that😂
ETH gets a lot of grief, but if you add the two league draws to the ‘We beat Liverpool’ trophy they won in the cup last month, this is actually a decent season for United!
City like this score thanks united
Just the way u were talking about Harry maguire
Never knew CHOAS was a word
Liverpool will return to their average selves once Klopp is gone can see it from a mile away
Handed Arsenal The Trophy Today
Thanks for the gift United, Liverpuddle in the mud😂
Mainoo what a player !
1:15 that groan off Carra! 😂😂  Fernandes takes the chance really well though. It’s not as easy as it looks, especially hitting it first time
Liverpool unbelievably leant nothing from FA CUP defeat. Qansah awful mistake, to play blind ball across the pitch crazy when keeper made pass for him - gift for UTD with empty goal. Nunez needs to pick his head up, simple pass simple goal rather trying to score from impossible angles. Bet MU can’t believe their luck!
How did Liverpool not win they were definitely the better team
What a goal by bruno Fernando's 1:24 😮
We haven't been good for years but if we can help stop Liverpool win the league then happy days!
Never a pen in a million years. Klopp milking dodgy decisions all season
This changes everything
This could go to the final day. 3 teams competing for title will make who wins it that extra bit special
Mainoo is just levels above many utd players,Utd need to prioritise him over anyone to build a team around,He’s a unique sensation.
It's simple. Both liverpool's and man city's defences aren't at the same level as arsenal's. Arsenal are big favourites
Who is choas 😂😂
As an Arsenal fan on loan to United I can’t imagine watching this every week We were lucky to not be 3-0 down in the first half
CHOAS!!!
Salah was so wrong for that pen. Onana had dived to that part for so long, salah didn't even place it in the corner
That title is absolutely choatic
Nunez is Shocking
United destroy liverpool's title chances
Sell mo salah
Salah  has dropped in levels
Are we all ready to agree Utd fans aren’t just hyping mainoo
Early
United and penalties is hilarious.
Both united goals were incredible my gosh
ABSOLUTE “CHOAS”
Did they spell chaos wrong intentionally? Or are they just stupid?
Mainooooo ❤❤❤ baller for United for next 15 years
Why is bruno all happy when their team is literally going to miss the 4th place 😂
We'll take it!! 😉🤷‍♀️ COYG 🔴⚪️💪
stop subbing garnacho off his stamina is better than any other players on our team
Liverpool have already bottled the title 😂😂😂 Today was a must win.
Kelleher trying to save it outside the box 😂
I’m still sad
City are gonna win it now.
your chaos was spelt wrong lad 😂
What was going through the head of Wan Bissaka.
Mainoo, what a player and just getting started as well 🔥
CHOAS
Mo saved us! That's why he's my favourite player! That's why we love Liverpool! And that's why they never give up!
who is this 78 for Liverpool, Steven Gerard?
Of course man United lose to penalties once again 😢
League over. Absolutely sh*t. Completely batter them for 50 minutes and should be about 5-0 up and then give a goal away like that because we’re far too slow and sloppy in possession. Diogo Jota please come back 😭
Thank you man United 😂😂😂
This just goes to show Liverpool are not a better team then us man for man but look where they are in the league. Get this guy out and watch the difference with manager that has a system not play the game that exposes all our players deficiencies
Another case of not taking chances and major mistakes costing them. Could've wrapped it up by half-time.
WHAT A GAME
A point is a point. Move on to the next game. YNWA
Liverpool need a new front 3. Even Firmino and Mane would have scored today guaranteed!
Liverpool have bottled it 😂
Mainoos goal had a touch of Federico Macheda about it 👌
Mainoo damn👌👌👌👌
Bruno's presence of mind there was clutch!  But the real winners this game was Arsenal... Could those missed chances come back to haunt liverpool?
That goal from Kobbie Mairadona was unbelievable, what a player he's becoming.
Over the 3 games this season I think Liverpool have had in excess of 80+ shots against the worst United in years.... And we've not won a game!!! All our composure just goes out the window!!! But it doesn't hide that United are so shite!!!
Two incredible finishes from united
United really got a point from that dogwater first half performance. How lucky we are.
We (Liverpool) don't deserve to win the league if we can't put our chances away against a poor Utd team that was wide open to be smashed.   Very poor from us.  Again having to rely on our rivals to drop points in the Hope we win the league.
Hard to feel like champions with that many missed chances.. Liverpool are good but need to be ruthless with their finishing.. not good enough 😢
Again lfc have been so frustrating to watch. Front three are indecisive and rash in front of goal.. players giving away the ball in dangerous areas. The mistakes are endless
Liverpool were winners last week they said.
Congratulations
Liverpool played like they were afraid to win. They lacked belief and it is for the players to address this not Klopp.
Credit to united to coming back but liverpool should have been out of sight at half time. Far too casual and not the first time
Sorry so you not gonna say how liverpool flopped etc etc like you would if it was Arsenal???
Why is Salah On the thumbnail without the pen he was the worst player on the pitch I thought he wanted to win this league 😂😂😂
If he leaves Garnacho on Man Utd win it
A second successive ridiculous penalty decision. Literally no contact on Bradley, that was a clear dive.  VARsenal, LiVARpool coming at just the right time. Now waiting on a VRchester City moment next game
Nice grammar choas 😂
Too many chances missed by Liverpool, we would've wrapped this game by 70 mins. We NEED JOTA back
This title race really gonna be interested any of the three teams have chance of winning it
What a goal by Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo, absolute class✨
Choas? Guess it is..
Fastest upload sky's ever done
Blame KSI for man u not winning.
Absolute choas
Everytime united breaks my heart
I wonder if Liverpool's 2-1 Controversial Defeat Against Tottenham will make a big difference at the end of the season  😬
United ended the quad and now maybe Liverpool’s title challenge. Ten Haag at the wheel
Imo needed to win. Had to keep the pressure on. I don't see Arsenal dropping a point tbh.   Let's hope and pray for some help, over to you Villa
United where very poor today and we still couldn't win should have been 5 up at half time crazy how many chances we miss.
How do people still not rate Mainoo he is absolute class. Not only is he fantastic on and off the ball but he scores shots like that
choas😂😂😂
Early
No way Klopp won 7-0 to never beat United again 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Uniteds first goal...what on earth are they doing😐
Fun fact:  Liverpool have faced man United 3 times these season:  Liverpool 0-0 Man United ( League)   Man United 4-3 Liverpool ( Fa Cup)   Man United 2-2 Liverpool ( League)  And Liverpool could not win once and these is the second time in league man united have stopped liverpool from going top this season   Man United knocked liverpool out of Fa cup and possibly the league title  Wow.
Who's here for the 'choas' at old trafford?
2:58 and Harvey Elliott dived over it…
Hahahaaha Liverpools title dream is over 🤣🤣🤣 United too strong for them again
Don't laugh gunners.  Manchester United are absolutely capable of doing the same to you.  Plus you still have to go to spurs!!!
I want a rematch
Ten Hag record against Liverpool: 3 wins 2 draws 1 loss  Ten Hag in
I had a feeling united woukd get smth from this game. They always seem to do unexpected things when they play horribly
As a Liverpool fan both teams played very well and the result could of been anyway
Choas ✅ Chaos ❌
WHAT A GG
Manoo scored a good goal....but only touched the ball about 12 times...looked weak again
I don’t understand why Fernandes was shushing in illusion celebrations
Salah playing fasted is not allowing him to be clinical this month I swear. God please help us
Liverpool fans saying that Chelsea robbed united and then they pull that😂😂😂😂
Arsenal are winning the league
choas😂
Great match.
Why everyone saying Liverpool losing the league when arsenal have hard teams to play against we have easy games to play arsenal will bottle it and if we win all our games we will beat city anyway 🎉
Quansah😢
What a CHOAS
What a goal by mainoo
Great spelling for chaos 👍
Mainoo living up to the hype... what a goal!!!!
mainoo is the best u20 rn. scoring bangers and holding the weak midfield of manchester united.
That kobbie mainoo goal was something else what a talent
Who else forgot there’s a match today
To have 14 shots and 1 goal against you in the first half with no response to then be leading 2-1 with 2 chances and to not win is the most United thing ever. Brilliant game tho
Choas alright!!! Nemtal
great job spelling chaos, sky sports in a nutshell
ABSOLUTE CHOAS!
Between Rangers vs Celtic and Utd vs Liverpool been cracking day of footy. 2 biggest rivalries in the land I’d say, both putting on a show. Noice.
Liverpool deserved the win, what a shame.
CHOAS OR CHAOS are you okay sky sports? 😂
Love abit of CHOAS
Mainoo’s goal was absolutely incredible! Especially for an 18 year old what talent🎉🎉
CHOAS AT OLD TRAFFORD
Arsenal go top ❤
Man utd should have won with those missed chances from Liverpool
This game proves one of Liverpool's biggest issue in a big game. The fact they aren't clinical at all
What a terrible giveaway
Fernadez>Rooney
As an arsenal fan we'll take a draw at the end of the day
I said it before and I’ll say it again. United are so Jekyll and Hyde. What a game. Frustrating to concede a penalty, but we take the point. Kobbie Mainoo btw, what a player he is. Unreal talent.
Mainoo is arguably one of the next stars in Man Utd’s future, hopefully eth doesn’t push him to soon and ruin his career
Chaotic yet enjoyable football match. Two points dropped for Liverpool. Title hopes slightly dented with both Arsenal and ManCity on their neck…
Forget the title race, not beating United once in Klopps last season hurts so bad.
Maino is an incredibly player, his composed nature is incredible and he's definitely one for the future
So we can draw to Liverpool but lose to Chelsea, does not make any sense
Thanks united - ARSENAL FANS
Arsenal fans take the W this week 💯
We can’t win the league now
Man u did well but not to well...
Livarpool bottle jobs 😂😂
I'm glad. As. My team are top on GD
Don’t think it was a pen for liverpool but nonetheless united didn’t deserve 3 points
“choas” nice spelling admin
Liverpool deserve to win
Bruno Fernandes with the goal of the season.
I think we can agree that Mainoo is a generational talent. This lad has so much potential in this league and he’s so exciting to watch
deadest derby of the season
CHOAS   Yes CHOAS…one team on the field and instead of 0-4 it ended up 2-2
mo salah ghosted the entire game yet scored one pen and got man of the match makes sense
The moment Liverpool lost the league
Congratulations to arsenal on winning the league🎉🎉🎉
Liverpool should have won this with how many chances they had😂
Cba with man united always losing or drawing at the end
Nunez back to doing Nunez things
casemiros legs have gone or hes given up.
never a pen . just want to give klopp a farewell party
Congrats to Man City for winning the league...
I’ll admit as a Liverpool fan onana was fabulous today
Quick uploads gotta rate it..
United never gave in…
The amount of chances Liverpool had
To be fair, that was a very INTENSE game in my mind.
Carra’s moan when Quansah gave the ball away is gold😂
Liverpool should have won that but in all fairness what a match🥶😭
Liverpool kept missing their chances but a very good match
Kobbie Mainoo 🥶🥶🥶
Liverpool really miss jota he’s the real bags man in this Liverpool team others are hot and cold
Fernandes and Mainoo absolute class 👌 Onana absolutely magic 💥
Let’s gooooo COYG ❤
Same old Man Utd parking the bus and trying to grind a result as usual,Typical jammy Mancs.🙄
I'm embarrassed to not win against a team like United
Kobbie Mainoo is the breakout under 20 player of the season by an absolute mile. Only 18 years old doing this wow.
Klop making mistakes again
CHOAS AT OLD TRAFFORD 😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
Liverpool failed to beat arsenal city and united in the league 💀💀
Should have been done in the first half
Salah always finds a way to score v United even if he isn’t his usual-self!
CHOAS instead of CHAOS😂😂😂
CHOAS at old Trafford???
Congrats Arsenal on the title.
United being battered in the first half just to score two screamers is just typical
2 draws against United, 2 draws against City, 1 draw and a loss against Arsenal and 1 draw to Chelsea. Every single time so far this season when we needed to show up we didn't. Can't help but feel that we threw it away  That sloppiness in the final third in the biggest games cost us the league in the 21/22 season when we didnt beat a single team in the Top 4 that year and I have a very grim feeling that this will be the exact same
Arsenal for PL???
COYG, the elephant is back on top of the tree! 🔴⚪
How Liverpool didn’t win that baffles me
Once again sky overexaggerate a 2-2 draw..
Man united defensively are a shambles
Letssss goooo
We deserved a win so unlucky
What a game 🎉🤩
mainoo is class
Choas uno
marvellous mainoo
1st
We’re top of the league 😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉
Mad
man u deserved the win
MAINOO!!!
My club GGMU ❤
Never a pen
Klopp is losing the plot, playing Quansa as CB, instead of Gomez and leaving Konate on the bench. Klopp literally allowing a young boy to get exposed just like he did in the FA cup match
First
First
Chaos spelt wrong mate  Like this comment if ur still here while it says “CHOAS”  EDIT: TOOK THEM 35 MINUTES TO CHANGE “CHOAS” TO “CHAOS”
