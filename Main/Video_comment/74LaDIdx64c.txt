Am i late to say Lets eat em all?
3:21 it happened
Well, if you think about it, that's how it should be. If there are only Pokémon, then some of them are edible. I know it's creepy and sad. It's just that if you think about it and question the Pokémon world.
I would do unspeakable acts for a charmander steak. I imagine it like a crisp Smokey slightly tender and juicy chewy bundle of deliciousness. Also I think it’ll taste good as a brisket
I eat chicken
Would change with each region I think. Miltank's milk is known for its healing properties and for that alone one could have a Miltank farm. The milk would be awesome for sick Pokémon and kids alike.
Dare you eat my Applin
"anything that look like food, anything that want to be eat ARE parasite"
scrumptious
He predicted the end of an era video
i like the fact that he predicted the farming game
a applein are you ok? 0:24
3:20 he knew
3:20 bro predicted Pokopia
I love chickens! I love them as friends, babies, eggs, livers, and meat. My dogs LOVE chicken liver. My grandmothers chickens are like my own bc I can’t have them. I hate to how they are degraded by commercial meat processing!! They are so foundational, they deserve respect.
3:21 OMG WAIT IT IS
One thing missing, taste. Im sure there are plenty of pokemon that would be easy to raise and farm, but how would a mudsdale taste? From the little I know about hunting, owls probably taste VERY gamy
I would eat mr.mime
I think cotton candy
you guys should make theory,os!
My protein comes from McDonald's.
I'm making out with a pillow.
hey, you forgot tofu
7:34 Thats a gabite,not Garchomp
I would Probably eat Some Slowpoke tail or Banana from Tropius since i don't wan't eat any Pokemon alive
0:24 noooo my poor boy applin
i feel so bad for that apple😢
7:36 not a garchomp , it’s a gabite
I love that you said "nurse joy is a pokemon" and then used her picture and called her a citizen
But we eat ostrich eggs
What about Fish Pokémons? Also I you should've made a video theorizing which Pokémons I should not eat for health reason!
You should do a pokemon crossover on the channels!! Idk what you would do on style theory, but the others could work well.
That thumbnail ruined my life
In the Philippines, people eat cats and dogs I think I am in a lot of trouble from the replies now I’m not the one who created it just telling but it’s just a thing
Applin is just a worm in an apple, matpat eats bugs.
But Pokémon only grow in the show/game when they evolve
But Pokémon come out of their eggs full size. Imagine the size egg you would have to have for a Miltank
pokemon war episode
Ngl hoot hoot looks like 1 giant chicken drumstick 11:53
I’m not a Christian, but if God does exist, and did create the world, then automating the process of creating new species is very smart. It gives us humans, those he supposedly loves more than any other, the ability to selectively breed animals and raise them to fit our needs. It gives us the tools to overcome our own challenges and take care of each other. Such as breeding cows and sheep to produce more milk and wool, or fruit trees and berry bushes to have greater nutritional value. Your children looking, sounding, and thinking like you and your spouse? That’s because of evolution. You’re passing down your genetics to your child, and when they have children, they’ll not only pass down your genes as well, but also the genes of their SO. These are wonderful things that evolution gives us the power to do. Small imperfections turned into amazing beauty. Everyday evolution makes the world a little bit better. I for one adore it. And if an all knowing intelligent being did make it, then I for one would applaud them.
Are you crazy
Wouldn’t Nurse Joy be the Best food source?
This is sick.
Don’t you dare eat my lucario! But go ahead with my Tauros, there’s too many of them
Stop Professor Oak would never eat me… would he?
Now that we know that nurse joy is a Pokémon… how about we eat nurse Joy instead of real Pokémon
Now that we know that nurse joy is a Pokémon… how about we eat nurse Joy instead of real Pokémon
I hate you…
Get your hands off of my adorable Pikachu and all the other cute Pokemon I don't watch Pokemon but as a kid I always wanted a Pikachu as a pet then I realized that they didn't exist :-( sad face
As soon as you said “the economics of farming”, I immediately went to a different video.
Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a Pokémon! Food Theory: Eat your Pokémon!  Pokémon Breeders: become cannibals
I wonder if hoot hoot was supposed to be 4.6 pounds and it was messed up in the code
The intro was scary.
im not eating a mud filled donkey that can trample me with SUPER POWERS! it literally can cause an earthquake
STAY AWAY FROM MY ETERNATUS!
MATPAT U POISONED URSELF APPLETON IS AXTUALLY A WORM IN A APPLE
Spearow would provide the best eggs.
can bellsprout or budew from pokemon considered as vegan food?
Pokemon! Got to eat them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No applin😢
3:15 why is nurse joy one of the civilians?
Who-wants whot whot??
Who-wants whot whot??
Noooooo ooooooo
Now you got me thinking about eating a nice tasty diglet/potato matpat
skidoo💀💀
I didnt realise this was food theory,I THOUGHT IT WAS Game THEORY
“That’s right, I’m doing a collab with myself” 😂
Because Theory channels is where the poop is A A A A A OH
I hate you
you gave me nightmares
7:34 the pokemon you shown. The grey one. That's gabites middle stage of evolution. Garchomp is the final evolution.
Still confused why bigbacks need a food theory
There are a lot of Pokemon that look pretty tasty.  I'd like to try Psyduck, Crabby, and Pidgee to name a few.  🙂
Still waiting on my personal Pokemon farming simulator
11:02 bro sounds like he’s rhyming
Who's here just to hear matpats voice?
Shuckle doesn’t get eaten it just makes produces a drink but also most steel electric types and every future paradox Pokémon are safe since every future paradox Pokemon is a robot and most electric steal type are also robots and most every poison Pokemon is safe there’s no way they are safe too eat
Kentucky Fried HootHoot
14:41 keep it PG now
He predicted PalWorld
I don’t eat cows
Torchic would be delicious
Mmm yes, cannibalism
gotta love professor oak's quirky sense of humour 🤣
also chansey  probably gives free fried eggs to it's trainer as a gift. ☺
pretty sure that all the people in the pokemon world eat the fish pokemon as there are loads of them.
everyone eats magikarp,I think that's widely understood.
i wanna eat bounsweet
Is eating a bellsprout vegan
HOOT HOOT NOOOOOOOOOOOO ITS ONE OF MY FAV
0:28 applin don't grow on trees there apples do
Yet again he ruined our childhood
This channel has good videos but good voice can definitely get annoying. Glad he finally retired
if humans are pokemon,  eat yourself
That was not a garchomp at 7:35 it was a gabite
0:50 It is increadibly funny that collabs with oneself is possible. Well done idea.
You can eat klawf in the gen IX games!
Miltank is also very much farmed in alola according to their anime
Ngl a pika burger sounds like it would go hard
I am vegetarian😅☃️☹️
The Pokémon community call "pidgey clones" tiny bird😂
*shocked Pikachu face*
If nurse joy eats a Pokémon is it cannibalism?
4 mins in you’ve answered nothing and had your dumb head on the screen about 10 times
What about eggs?
I imagine MatPat eating a noctowl and then being haunted by barnaby from billie bust up as a pokemon
7:38 …that’s a gabite not a garchomp I’d expected better
My diet is almost 85% pizza
Me before seeing: happi happi happi Me after seeing this: oh ok *snaps neck*
I feel like I should watch this for an ag project if I ever get one
Matpat why did you make this😭😭😭😭🥺😭😭🥺😭🥺🥺🥺🥺😭🥺😭😭🥺🥺😭🥺😭😭🥺🥺🥺😭🥺😭😭🥺🥺😭🥺😭🥺😭😭🥺🥺🥺😭🥺😭😭🥺🥺🥺😭🥺😭
He told us the future 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 0:43 vid in bowl on left (probably😅)
Not the Dig-Wich trio😭😭
MATPAT WHAT THE FU-
I keep thinking of starly meat and basculin pancakes
0:20 …..who’s gonna tell him Applins don’t actually grow on trees….and the apple isn’t even part of the pokemon until it evolves…..
this was obvious
Farmer can have a skidoo we can too
“…. Should I eat a Clam”
7:34 Matpat: Garchomp Also Matpat 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘤𝘦𝘦𝘥𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘎𝘢𝘣𝘪𝘵𝘦
but hes gone...
12:48 YOU FOOL! YOU THOUGHT MEGA METAGROSS WAS A LEGENDARY?
Applin is a wyrm inside an apple...
Cannibalism week: I have come back
he said garchomp and showed gabite
4:27 fun fact in poland we eat mostly poultry as it is the most profitable here meanwhile cow’s and such are more expensive wich is why there is so little beef in poland so uhh yeah there’s your daily fun fact
I think I'm going vegan
What is that hottest language: 4:12
That's not garchomp
Yeah who is stopping me Mmmmmm pokesnacks
3:08 POKEMON CAFE REMIX
Cristopher Rapid
Pokemon are firends,not food
Amazing video, :)
Cant believe you talked so much about Hoothoot and didnt put a single TOH reference. Very disappointed in you Matpat.
4.46 no not goat sim
thats Crull
Shut up Matpat! No one can eat shuckle
I want to eat the rarest one!
Martin Ruth Harris George Hernandez Joseph
Appletons Apple sir fetched and far fetched their weapons look yummy krabby and slowpokes tail looks yummy and squirtle prob Lapras or goldeen seaking and magikarp
12:17 the Night Shamalama Twist
I paid close attention to the food they ate In gen 1 theres talk about not eating tofu from bill and bacon double cheeseburgers instead. Fish at the gym. Anyways in gen 1 that topic is kinda hinted at Gen 2 3 and 4 aswell but not as much Gen 5 and 6 Ash and friends were all vegetarian they didnt eat meat once.  Gen 7 ash learned about being thankful to the food he ate and he began eating meat again. Gen 8 i dunno i dont really remember havent rewatched it. Hope that helps
It sounds crazy but it makes sense Pokémon are animals in this world so people are gonna eat then but they problem eat them less
I was thinking of Taurues this whole time for red meat..
You’re one percent wrong on that Matpat because there are normal animals you see it when the group went back to Misty’s old gym there was an aquarium with Pokémon and regular fish meaning that there could be separate factories that produces and grows all of the meat that they eat plus in a few Pokémon games team rocket is seen cutting off Slowpoke tails and selling them and you and the police are trying to stop them because it’s illegal to eat Pokémon so see your theory is one hundred percent wrong
So you want to eat your self 😂
When you were listing bird Pokemon, it sounded like you were singing the poke rap
I Think PETa in Pokemon would be poka
But pokemon eat sandwiches?
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 😢😢😢
you have ruined My childhood forever and What is theory Is disgusting so disgusting
🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈😋🤯🤯🤯🤮🤮🤮🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
Ummmmmmmm
Magikarp
What about magic ark for people who eat fish
Matpat: Pidgey clones Me: you do know that it's called early route bird don't you?😑
I mean I don't blame you if you eat bulbasaurs cabbage he'll probably just regrow it
Chicken nuggets😊😊😊
Food Theory: *says that you could eat pokemon* Also Matpat: nurse joy is a pokemon Brock: *hahaha*
Yes you can eat pokemon but that doesnt mean ash ketchum should be eating pikachu 💀
"Pokemon can be eaten!"  Me : "TIME TO EARN SOME MONEY FROM MA RESTAURANT"
I’ll eat a Gardevoir any day of the week.
Poor Pikachu.  He’s been in Ash’s platter for the past ten years.
0:21  Eee it's a worm in the fruit and you eat it
It’s time to eat some grilled Arceus!
I haven't seen the video. Just tell me if it's okay or not for me to Eat up my Gardevoir😩
A theory that you could answer is who is ash’s father
I got a pokemon ad for this
Pokemon scarlet and violet confirmed that people eat pokemon (even though most people already knew pretty much)
Matpat - closing out the episode talking about eating nurse joy  Degenerates - i wish i could eat Nurse Joy 😂
I want to eat Applin ngl.
You forgot Cherubi
Bro called gabite a garchomp 7:38
Bro most of the time your not talking about pokemon😂😂
But an Applin is a worm inside the apple (I’m talking about 0:22)
Miltank is definitely the Pokémon I am most willing to eat
So what bout torchic or something
Weird you didn't consider fish
Since mudbrey is a ground type I am concerned that part of the reason it is so heavy is that it has a lot of inorganic material (Dirt) integrated into it's anatomy. If that's the case Mudbrey meat could be terrible for you. Or, taste just like dirt.
No….NO…..NOOOOOOOOO
U no that milktank can be milked every day right? 😅
9:34 blue skiddo,we can too!
We all 😢 you😭😭😭😭
❤
Guys this video is so educational
Don enak pokemon 😠🤬😓
How to get dark.
Mudbray would probably taste like dirt and i find it odd how he didnt go into flavor at all but all in how it affects the producer
So annoying that YouTube suggests the same video to you again. I watched this video less than a year ago and its back at the top of my recommendations
‏‪3:00‬‏ right:spacetoon planet

The pokemon inkay is a squid which meant...😮🤪 ...c ... calamar ...i ...!!!?????????????????????????????????????
nurse joy Did she get eaten?
So You're Saying I Can Cook A Pikachu And Be Ok With It?
I mean it may be good to consume pokemon but just know it would hurt to do it, depends on how much you care for it
Bye matpat....
E
You know what's funny Applin is just a worm he ate a worm
This is my first ever  MatPat video ever
I keep on forgetting this is food theory and it’s not game theory
It doesn't have to be the Pokemon that aren't already food. You can get another type and get the meat.
I eat more crab in a day than 1/3 😂
Aplins are actually worms
Applin is actually just a worm the apple is seperate
We need a coffee pokemon
I just came here from the nurse joy is a pokemon video and I have a theory to propose. Sooo... If some Pokemon were once human and some Pokemon evolve into humans does that mean that eating pokemon makes one a cannibal?
How dare you😥😡🤬🤬🖕
Noòooooooooo
Idk what to say so ima say smth random Who likes brisket? 👇🏻
Matpat Retired But Did you know the amazing digital circuits used to be a anime💀💀💀💀
We forgetting about when Jessie and James trying to eat a togepi egg
3:20 looks like palworld beat them to the punch…
Ditto...muk yummy
This video foreshadowed matpats retirement, 0:41
Why does some pokemon acts so smart and others act like common animals ?
You mean the living Cancer cell
7:34 matpat: garchomp " shows a picture of a gabite "
0:26 applin!!!!!!!!
You got to try again on this and think of taste, by you I mean not MatPat
Skiddoo 💀
Got any Jimmy Dean Duel links content? JK. I like my pokemon unfainted. 😮
Regional birds, nah too expensive, I got pidgey clones.
Ah yes who doesn’t love ‘fetchling’ and ‘muckrow’
yeah, other than the fact that pokmon has a number of berries, veggies, fruits, and milk, the meat and fish is limited to pokemon
4:01 As for lobsters and shrimps they contain a certain poison that makes your shik itchy as for oisters they don't taste good. And even if they were people would get bored eating the same thing all the time
Gotta eat e'm all
Just saying, Ah yes, Appetun
This video has a lot of misinformation about actual farming
Not a single beef cow in this whole video
Wow that even mandjtv made a video that pokemon should be edible,if cooked or eaten just that
😂😮😢
Bruh
💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
PalWorld: Hello there...
Combined game theory and food theory
Ash eating pikachu: Mwahahahaha
That Pokedex sounded like it was voiced by Bill Cipher.
7:30 u could also hatch ur pokemon go pokemons while in a car. So they could build a egg hatching conveyor belt
Goats are not primarily raised for their meat; they are usually kept for milking. Then, when they are too old for milking, they are slaughtered for meat, which doesn't yield much. Moreover, goat milk isn't as widely consumed as one might think. Perhaps it's too fatty for some people's preferences, so it's often used for making cheese, a process that takes longer and costs more. In fact, total global goat milk production was estimated at 18.7 million tonnes in 2017, whereas cow's milk production reached around 549 million metric tons in 2023. This makes cow's milk more profitable due to higher sales and lower costs. Additionally, in some countries, cows are considered holy and not used for food, which is why goats are used instead.
NOOOO PIGGGGGGSSSSSSSS
Applying growth rate makes no sense, other than for evolution. Applying too much logic from our world is wrong. Miltank HATCH fully grown. Exp only changes stats, not size. So how long it takes to hatch does matter as well as the stage it hatches INTO for example. Miltank hatches full sized as does Tauros only having one stage. Also, birds probably dont just lay eggs in Pokemon. Itd be best to actually eat unhatched garchomp eggs or something because they travel well.. and just eat them. Mass produced using dittos.
Mareep & Woohoo almost certainly wind up being the dominant meat sources. I'm shocked they never came up once.
Had goat for the first time a month ago, in a halal stew. Absolutely delicious. More westerners should try it.
Meanwhile in Palworld
5:05 USA land is noIt cheap
i eat Nurse Joy okay
Woo hoo fletchling is safe
so can diddo disguise as a human?
*palworld enters the chat*
0:07
Do not even eat my cinderace in a new vid or i would eat you
Good thing Torchic my favorite Pokémon is not the choice on poultry
Chomp chomp

Palworld really took this video seriously
Several years later, and we got Palworld that makes eating the mons a core part of the gameplay.
Crazy that he didn't show or mention the actual chopped up Magikarp dish we ACTUALLY SEE in the anime
2 years later and palworld took you literally
This episode hits different after PalWorld came out
It must be hard to be a vegan in the pokemon world. You never can be sure if your vegetables came from the patch or a sentient being.
This aged well.
Why you eating Pokemon cas if you eat pikachu you get electric’s
Bruh cavier isn't expensive bc it's fish eggs, it's expensive bc of the process of getting them right from sturgeons in a man-made environment
Palworld: Say no more fam
Problem with some of your calculations. Especially HootHoot. Is that some of the Pokémon are outright too smart to be used as a food source. Not to mention HootHoot is capable of precognitive abilities
Wow Matpat slaughtered those Pokémon pronunciations.
Funny how pokemon fans bash palworld for this exact reason.
Tastiest pokemeal: oiled lopunny's A$$
Are you sure that's a Garchomp at 7:38 ? ;)
Palworld must have loved this video
Matpat should have checked his pronunciations… Muckrow… skidoo… etc. you are killing me
I just watched you're Nurse Joy is a Pokémon video 😂
I remember in the Pokemon anime,  Magikarp are eaten
Normal slowpoke without a tail. It’s still a win/win. Delicious meal plus evolution into slowking. I wonder if you gain its power if you eat it 🍴
plaworld devs be like :
Well With Palworld out now Lol
Just came back to say PalWorld
Can you eat nurse joy?
This hits different now.
Garchomp accidentally being Gabite is a funny mistake lol
You can now in Palworld!
This video aged well
My guess is magic carp
why tf did u come up with dis idea matpat now I hate u and im glad ur leaving
Lol
i want to eat pekachoooooo!!!!!!!!!
2:40
But when we talk about feeding, we also need the animal is easy to raise. Chicken indeed is the easier as they won't fly, and they are quite "indoor" don't like to go far away. So for the bird, we also need to think if they will fly away or not. But anyway it is a really interesting one
MatPat: Yes you should eat your pokemon Royal Pear and Melon: WHAT?
Yea but Mudbray only weighs that much because ground type. You can't eat dirt, even Pokédirt. Mudsdale might be worth it in terms of how much actual meat you get, but again, it's mostly hardened mud, which is probably where the weight comes from, and also, you need to raise a Mudbray thirty levels just to get one. Which in anime terms isn't that easy. Tauros is the obvious choice, since there's so many of them, and again, the diet would vary by region. So maybe Unovans eat Bouffalant. Which would be...accurate.
CURSE YOU
FUJBJBAJAJHBJAWBNJBK YOU CURSEED
In generation nine, there is straight up a cooking ingredient that is a part of a Pokémon, I’m aware of this was made way before that, but I’d still like to point it out
... If all pokemon hatch from ( and presumably lay ) eggs, does that mean all pokemon are similar to Platypus?
Team noctowl 👇
If people where the same as Pokemon in the past  in the nurse  joy video then in the pokemon universes past what did they eat where pokemon and humans where the same and could even marry eachother
"Its like they looked through the logistics of it, Koffing, the poison, gas pokemon !!!NOPE!!!"
Get to the point buddy
Someone took your advice
magikarp farms mskes the most sense to me.  Harvest  once evolved right.     Skill kinda get that bird qith flying type.         Thank you the waste of time
3:54  use use?
Matpat: pydgey clones Everyone else: regional birds
This is all well and good but it’s important to consider that Pokémon age or size doesn’t correlate to level. A Pokemon gains levels only through battles and experience and it doesn’t affect their body unless they evolve. Pokemon age over time like real animals and their size is dependent on age and just random chance.  Saying this cause matpat used levels as a factor of maturity when they have nothing to do with each other
7:00
Don’t eat Pokémon!
There is a reason that despight the efficiency difference and rate of reproduction cows are still only 60% more expensive than chickens.  They upcycle straight up GRASS. Chickens and pigs can't do that.  Pigs can do food waste and chickens can do bugs, but those are much more work intensive than a straight up empty field that gets rained on occationally. That's efficiency!
…
Wut the World big whale can it fit in a pokèmon card? Wut is it? Tell me pls I want it!
True
Apple and do not grow on trees. Little worm takes apples that do grow on trees.
your data for milk pokemon is still not good enough bc moomoo milk is sold in pokemarts
So does Mattpat think they dont eat Tuarus?
We do eat Ostrige and Ostrige egg as well as EMU. Its just chickens are more Common in a lot of places
Cows are butchered in 30 months
Is it ok to eat a Mr mime?  Asking for a friend
Good luck eating magcarco without burning your insides
We all know that arceus meat would be godly in taste and price
Is eating Cherubi vegan or not-vegan then
I LOVE POKEMON! WHY EAT THEM!
From what I know about eating Pokémon in canon…almost no Pokémon are actually harmed in the process, almost everything are just things that naturally fall off or can regrow……at least that’s the case in Paldea
Best video game food source would be cystipigs from outer worlds.
I would love to see a mini series of this, where he breaks it down by region/generation. Like what meat and other products did Ash and his mom eat in generation 1 XD  I would also like to point out that lamb and veal aren't legit babies when slaughtered. Lamb meat comes from lambs age 10 months to a year. Veal comes from calves an average of 18 months old.
You monster who eats their own pokemon!!!
The problem with skiddo is that its available in very few regions
I not gonna eat rats 0:00
I’m always thought that children would peal off the skin which grows back and it’s been confirmed that the slowpoke tail grows back
Nothing that I noticed in one episode: In Pokémon Indigo league in episode 32:The Flame Pokémon-Athon! Later in the episode you can see ash eating a fried Magikarp wow ash wow
Gotta eat them all pokemon!
He should make a video of whether or not fairy types or drugs, or if you get possessed when you eat a ghost type
Appletun is like a caramel apple. A yummy candy apple that kids eat. And yum! Medium rare miltank for dinner!"
You forgot dairy eggs
They to eat pokemon as you see they eating stake
Okay. MATPAT! The reason mudstale is so heavy is because it has metal on it!
Hold up if nurse joy is a pokemon can we eat her
he couldve just taken the applin out of the apple!
Noooooooooooooo not real!!!!!!!
my food is meat meat and a little more meat
9:29 SKIDDO !!!!!! SKID-OH
7:37        *that is   n  o  t      a garchomp*
Hold up! My manz just showed gabite instead of garchomp, boiiii lol
Mudbray meat 🍖🥩would be yummy I would like to try that
I want to eat a mudbray
L
Yo id eat nurse joy if you know what I mean
you can just eat nurse joy hold up wait  a minute
4:32 also one of the reasons climate change is so strong
You should’ve found out the common food provider Pokémon per region
The sun in moon Pokémon series actually already raises that donkey Pokémon
I feel like he shouldve included seafood.
6:55 ha milk stashed he
Fthrrr control h
"Skiido". THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT.. THEEEE GOAAATT!!!!!
This makes me hungry
I think he should make that an actual Nintendo switch game I mean I would play it
silly farmers, don't you know all you need is ditto
7:34 ah yes my favorite pseudo gabit- i mean garchomp
89789
Egg: Chansey  Milk/Meat: Nurse Joy
Miltank milk
Let me see I have one shiny snorelax delicious
i hate this video
I would love catching crad pokimon
You just said your name if you are wondering nine no wet so if you don’t want to any of your YouTube fans to know it, you just send it
1,000 steps is about 2/3th of a kilometer, or 8 to 10 minutes of walking, I got board and counted how many steps it takes to reach my house to the store in my town lol 🤣  Edit, now that I think about it, if each tile is like a meter (3'6") or so, then that's three steps, turning 1,000 into 3,000 steps, making it half an hour per walk, a 2 kilometers walk, give or take... 🤔
Haha, MatPat said Muckrow 🤣Don't beat yourself up about it, happens to the best of use ;)
The collab we didn't know we needed but deserved (A bit late am i?)
I am just going to delete that Miltank pissing milk image from my memory.
Pidgey clones are called legendary birds by the pokemon comunity
💀💀💀
Gtyyujghmvhjs
Did you play goat simulator
No you shouldn’t eat pokémon
Dude, I’m a farmer and it takes around 6 to 12 months for a chicken to get to full maturity start laying in the middle to be a worthwhile to eat
Excuse me?! How does Hoothoot weigh as much as my toddler
The amount of pokemon names he mispronounced is disgusting
lets eat a nurse joy
What i DON'T like about this is that Pokemon are a bit more smarter than our animals. We can hear them cry helplessly as they bleed out to death. Anyone remember that scene in the Alolan Pokemon League with Ash and Guzma and his Golisopod did huge damage to Pikachu's stomach? Imagine those cries by another Pikachu as a poacher starts cutting it's limbs off.  So is anyone up for fresh Pichu meat now?
14:40 🫢😬😨😱🤯matpat…😳 no please no… I want to believe you did this by accident…matpat = brock
Can i eat my bundle bee ¿¿¿¿🐇🐇
I think nurse joy would be the less edible Pokémon      (get it?)
I have come to say that you have ruined my life and joy of this show.
Please do a lore video on the Pokemon adventures Manga
Regional bird: 👎🙅‍♀️🚫  Pidgey clones: 👍👏🙌
8:45
7:35 it's showing a gabite, not a garchomp
Considering the bond humans and Pokémon develop that was truly unnecessary and pretty disturbing, Pokemon are superior to beasts...could have been better if there were regular animals as well-cause It also very unckear how man appeared in Pokémon world, or even meat didn't existed, but there are still carnivore Pokémon.
Can you imagine someone going out of their way to catch a legendary pokemon only to eat it???
I know the best is Pokémon for food is at shocking 99999999999999999999999989889888888898999899999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999899999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999.00000000001kg is Ur mom Ur mom is a slow leveler class but u need only one for the universe and Ur good
Poor Applin
Torchicken nuggets
Hoothoot buffalo style tenders sound really nice.
I would never eat Pokémon 😅
I think I recall Dawn or May saying smth like she could go for a hamburger in sm episode
Would Magikarp be eaten as food?
Mudbray aren't good
Hoothoot is an owl, i dont know about eating owls
Imagine eating dinner. Normal right. Youre eating your hoot hoot or your mudsdale. Then you somehow eat a revive. The horror.
Why not? Pokemon is just like animal 😂
If pokemon were people and people were pokemon wouldn’t all this be cannibalism 😬

Me seeing a krabby on the bed: 🤨 My mom cooking it for dinner: 😎
Digimon fans be like: Steaks do grow from the ground.
I thought that hoot hoot was made out of metal
Somtimes heavier weight means tough meat, not always fatty, so horse meat are not a good choice to eat
there is a muslim woman on instagram who analyzes which pokemon are halal and which aren't. That wasn't the original point of her channel but people kept asking XD
This makes me cry
WTHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhk😊
there are new pokemon that would fit in here are smoliv, dolliv, Arboliva (olive pokemon)lechonk and oinkologne (domestic pigs)
wailord actually has such a low density that it should fly up high into the sky, just floating to the sky
lots of fish pokemon, bovines like tauros and miltank, smoliv, lechonk, oinkolonge and pretty much any other livestock type
Watch the anime, and the people in pokemon eat actual food. Not to be rude or disregard your opinion.
Personlly I just want to eat miltank turn it into steak ,burger any meat really
Animal abuse🤪
Blud needed 9 people to make the inernet
the main factor missing is the taste what use is it to be efficient if it tastes horrible
Can I just say. Didn’t matpat say nurse joy was a Pokémon? Can nurse jot legally eat a Pokémon? Why did matpat put nurse joy as a regular townsperson when he was talking about there regular pokédiet
MAT why pika is whyyy he too cute and inasint whyy😢😢😢😢😢😢
“Eat your Pokemon” you say no I will not and plus they are really powerful creatures that’s definitely going to defend itself from a crazed person who’s trying to eat it I’m definitely rooting for the Pokémon
My starter pokemon is level 7
Why would people eat Pokémon
How can farfetched be a rare delecasy when you just need one farfetched and one ditto to breed them and make an infinite amound of them?
but bigger is better
COFFEE, A POISON GAS POKÉMON!
Considering Nurse Joy is a pokemon now... I'd be eating her.
Why is the beginning so gruesome yet comedic? AND WHY DO I LOVE IT?!
Learn to love Jesus
The conversion of Pokémon stat terms to real life terms like maturity hurts my head a bit as someone who has read up on pokemon stats for days lol. I’m not sure but usually level doesn’t matter for a pokemons size or ability to produce milk so idk man xD
In 3:12, you used the Pokemon Cafe Remix game and I loved that game, and also do a theory on mew.
EAT PIKACHU
Eat your pokemon      Its picachu
Please tell me someone else noticed when he said Garchomp you should've image of Gabite
I feel like the mudbray line would be terrible to eat most of the meat is probably mucle so it would be super tough
A buck 1.69
Don’t eat your Pokémon
oh wow nice pokemon red intro
Leveling (slow or fast) should have not been considered in this video since Level refers to its battle level. Since pokemon are somewhat like magic. Once an egg hatches, the pokemon would already have its height and weight, magically inconsistent with the height and weight of the egg. Imagine in pokemon go, you are holding an Onyx egg along with other large pokemon eggs. You walk the egg to hatch, then poof. Once it hatches, your very handy onyx egg becomes 480 pounds of solid rock. In which i doubt the tranier can now carry.

klawf in gen 9 is edible as you an see in a shop
See in this world I'd be a vegetarian there's just no way I'm eating a poor magikarp however if alcremie and vanilluxe weren't harmed I'd be tempted 👀

I feel like Hoot Hoot would be a red meat
Still watching the video first thought is that Buffalo Pokemon whatever its name is
But doesn’t Chikorita taste like chicken if seasoned right
Why does every pokemon grow out of reptile and bird eggs
Pokémon don't have real world animals all animals are Pokémon so most likely you're eating them
The only problem I have with this is regions. Not all pokemon are available in every region. So I was hoping he would talk about the different diets based on pokemon available in their area. Like what do they eat in Kanto vs alola or sinnoh vs paldea. There are so many possibilities considering he said in the real world even though goat is cheaper to feed its more labor intensive so the us sticks with cows. Plus in the real world diet also depends on culture so even if goat became cheeper it would still probably not catch on because beef so ingrained in western culture. I would love to see a follow up theory discussing regional diets
The reason we don’t eat ostrich is because it’s too costly and long to ship from Australia
Jesus died on the cross for our sins
Doesn’t the Pokédex for some Pokémon’s compare them with real life animals.
Why are we even watching this😂
Who is that Pokemon?? Chicken Burger!!!
Not YOUR Pokémon, that you train. You see, Pokémon are the animals of the Pokémon world.  So where does our steak come from?
now i wonder what that bbq in the beggining of sword and shield was made out of...
Btw I saw fish that are not fish in indigo league
Why Pokémon to add Pikachu to😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😁😭😭😭😁😭😭😭😭😩
I eat alcreamie irl, they are real
Ò^Ò
I love jiggly puff❤😊
I think magikarp would be eaten a lot
Yum Lucario steaks. 200% my daily dose of iron
Yeah but mudbray tastes like dirt...
They used the sprite of Gabite when he mentioned Garchomp
Lower level Pokémon have more tender meat lmao
7:12 MatPat: "...or to be more accurate..." My brain: "...or to be more eggurate..."
🙀I can't talk now
U make me uncomfortable
Magicarp is the tastiest, but you can’t get to its skin because the red you see is actually a shell.
People always say "he takes a week to publish a episode it shoudlnt be so logn" when he owns 2-3 channels currently right now. And in my time right now in 2023 he has flimsy and style theory ofc it takes so long yet he always gets it on in Saturday or friday! AMAZING
I’m not kidding when I say you taught me literally everything I could not find a good tutorial for before the halfway point. Not just for animation, but in general, this was exactly what I was looking for and I’m so hyped this video is finally out! Thanks you so much.
We need a Style Theory on Pokemon to complete the wheel
7:33 aw cmon matpat, garchomp is one of the most popular pokemon out there there's no way you got a picture of gabite for it
wouldn't magikarp be the best option? it only requires about 1k steps to hatch and it levels up quickly, even evolving into gyarados at level 20 which with all that information it could be one of the best mass produced pokemon to eat.
I wish you had addressed one thing, according to the art on the Pokémon cards, there are cows, pigs and chickens in the Pokémon universe too. They choose to eat intelligent Pokémon over livestock in that world.
Why u so mean to these creatures there just pokemon
Anyone notice that when matpat said garchomp he puts a picture of gabite 7:34
Did man just put mega metagross as a legendary
When i saw the title i was so comfused
Mat that's a Gabite
7:34 dude said garchomp but showed a picture of gabite
Imagine if you make your own brand of cereal
It hurts eating this rock dude with fists what part did i mess up
6:35 🤭
7:39 omg it’s totally not a gabite!
HootHoot the discord mod Pokémon 💀
u vegetarian? no problemo. get a sitrus berry with some sweet leppa and youll have yourself i fine, plant based, vegetaran meal
Discussing theory about how you should eat your Pokemon and Matpat showcasing their game theory on how nurse Joy is a Pokemon seems like he's hinting something.
Tbh, Skidoo and Muckrow physically pained me
7:33 uhm... thats a gabite...not a garchomp....
I’ll eat nurse joy 😏
Nurse joy  is a pokémon and you should  eat  your  pokémon  Hmmmm what is wrong here Canibalism?
I think MatPat shouldn’t have looked over MooMoo milk so fast. Not only does it compare to a real world cow, but MooMoo milk is ACTUALLY MADE AND SOLD IN THESE GAMES. I think sun and moon was out at this time and there’s literally a local Milktank ranch there
Paldea gets steaks from imported miltanks. Tauros are more loyal. How else do you explain no miltanks in paldea
Catch miltank and trade it's milk for more food money. Otherwise it's steak
So people mostly eat dairy, eggs and meat NO! (my protein is 95% nuts(the other 5% is edamame))
Skip hatching the egg just fry it
Actual commonality of the species should count for more than level rates and hatch times. We're asking what pokemon do they eat not what pokemon they should theoretically eat. Magikarp is top tier. Pidgey is much more common than Hoothoot. Psyduck is also more common and nearly the same size.  If we're dedicated to farming then Gyarados gives excellent yield at 500 lb each, which can be grown from common magikarp. Tentacool is like a 100 lb squid too but it's possible it's poisonous.
Magikarp is probably one of the top choices. In East Asia, carp are highly prized fish, and as you pointed out, they are very fast reproducing and growing, and fish don't need to be farmed you can just let them reproduce in the wild.
Chickens are only efficient to raise if your society produces excess grain to feed them. Cows goats and sheep eat grass, which humans can't eat and grows in regions where crop agriculture is hard. I'd argue that they are actually more efficient food sources in this context.
Culture plays a much bigger part than you're willing to give credit to. We aren't avoiding eating goats because they'd cost more. Beef is noticeably more expensive than either pork or chicken but we keep eating it because it's important in our culture and because our ancestors passed down cattle farming techniques and beef based cookery. We eat a lot less pork in America because there's a noticeable number of Jews and Muslims. Fish, especially freshwater fish, is very little consumed because Americans like convenient food and don't bother picking bones out of their meat.
Just because something is edible does always means it is eaten. For example zebra has lot of meat but isnt harvested cause it is hard to domesticate. So weak pokemons are more likely to be food source.
Just because a pokemon is heavy doesn't mean it has more meat (muscles).  Size of the pokemon should also taken into consideration.
Wow, this is wrong on so many levels. Let me explain:  1. You say you dont take evolution into account cause they wouldnt be battling... but then you still look at experience gain. thats a contradiction. what you NEED to do is look at how much exp a pokemon requires to reach its final form, or the form you want to slaughter it at. the daycare shows us that pokemon can gain experience passively!  2. you just take a lazy look at our world and copy paste it onto the pokemon world. but in the real world, there are animals that have a higher food to protein conversion rate than chicken, INSECTS. the pokemon world has an abundance of large insects that would be perfect for fast protein production!  3. What you totally miss are the things that actually makes the pokemon world stand out. What about ditto? Ditto doesnt need to evolve, needs no exp cause it can transform right away. It obviously has a massive matter density if it can transform into pokemon much larger than itself. so in terms of calories, it should be a superfood.   4. You didnt even take a look at plant pokemon. MOST OF OUR FOOD IS PLANT BASED!  5. We eat more meat than fish or sea food cause by now the oceans are overfished and its expensive. Look at the Japanese, they eat way more fish than the americans, but you only look at it from the american viewpoint which is a HUGE mistake since thats not even the region the pokemon world is from. Magicarp are a very potent food source in the pokemon world.   6. If you Actually look at the price of food production, then you made another big mistake. its not just about how fast are the animals to raise, but also how many offspring do they have in a year. if we just claim that insects wouldnt be possible, then what about rodants? mice breed like crazy but we dont breed them for human consumption cause they are too small. but we all know of a certain purple rat that has a decent size and even evolves very early. THAT would be a good food source.   This was a really lazy video, im disappointed in you Matpat. Hope you read this and adress this.
Did he jsut tell us to eat nurse joy?
Game/film theory put with food theory lol
MatPat should make part two for this for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, there’s more new Pokémon entries that says people eat them.
Mat pat: beef is one of the best animals to farm
WHAT THE HECK- DONT EAT EEVEE
With 9:00 in mind, makes me wonder if evolution also isn’t the Pokémon getting older, but a survival tactic. Since Pikachu actively fights evolving. So if a Pokémon lived a more adventurous life and was often placed under stress I.e battle triggers the need to evolve. But if they live a relaxed non stressful life, there’s never a need to evolve
if he says “skidoo” again im gonna kms
Houthout is heavier than me 😅
miltank I want to see it suffer
applins arent the apple they are the worm
"people call me the food theorist" matpat people only know you for game theory be honest I know its a channel plug but dude
Appletun would be the tastiest it says that children used to have him as a snack
I want someone to answer the question “How do you slaughter Pokemon?” They faint after attacks that should absolutely destroy it, so how would you fully take its life? Absolutely morbid but definitely unanswered
I don't think MUDsdale's meat would be eaten because I would personally not eat mud
I'm eating chicken while watching this
I think Shuckle's Berry juice could be farmed, no need to slaughtere. And Foie gras would easily be illigal in their universe. It is a far more compassionate one than our own.
Don’t let the vegan teacher see this or she will have a new song
Haha. Less than  a third of a pound. You forgot about Mainers
(Sandi) Personally, I thikk that only Brock would have the desire to eat Nurse Joy. Jus' sayin' ^_^
do something where all 3 of your channels make pokemon theories.
This entire video is thrown out when you think about the fact that pokemon hatch fully grown, you can get a ditto to breed with multiple at once, and if pokemon was real there would undoubtedly be a rare candy factory so you can raise them to maturity in 5 minutes
Should this be a game theory at least or both not really sure
I'm surprised he didn't say, "Gotta click em all"
Ooh... that pronunciation of Murkrow as "Muckrow" 😬
why are are u writing essays on this vid
Mudsdale is literally a horse made of mud no?
I'm pretty sure we wouldn't eat mud donkey the same reason we wouldn't eat mud hens
what about the fish?
ill eat a pikachu
Consider a spherical miltank...
Not to surprised it's rl
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! ARE YOU CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!??????????????????!!!!!!!!
mmm applein tast better with fear
I'd definetly eat out Nurse Joy
umm actually aplins arent actually the apples
lol hoothoot is almost as heavy as me
Before you watch this video, do not watch on an empty belly or if you’re prone to midnight cravings
What about the aloha version of Pokemon there's a farm with a lot of toros and milked
That part at the end there makes me wonder how these normal farmers are slaughtering creatures with magic powers anyways
In australia we eat crickets and snakes
I TASTE DISGUSTING I SWEAR
I just thought pokemons were the animals of pokemon
𝙀𝙅
Wait is nurse joy is a Pokémon then can you eat nurse joy?
Arboliva is essentially infinite Olive oil.and scovillain and garganacl are just pepper and Salt.  Also pokemon eat humans so it quite literally an eat or be eaten world
ffduf
what about turttle

Actually everything is edible the first time you try it. Whether you will try it the next time depends on whether you get to live a next time after eating it.
Klawf sticks
I just got Ad that Pets are raw
i wanna know what plant pokemon i can eat i hate plants
On ep 18 indigo league someone says you can't even eat tent cool (prob miss spelled that) so yes they do
Excecute and foonqus or amoongus or pumbkaboo pie yummy and tauros beef and scovillain head and totally alcremie and then vanillite and appletun together
I don't wanna eat Muk in pokemon violet 🤮 you sayed in videos picture eat your pokemon
Wait wait wait so if they eat Pokémon wouldn’t it be cannibalism, because it’s canonically and Pokémon and humans are like the same or something?!
Me and my dad have a jokw that mr mime is the most delicious Pokémon.😂
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎😤😤😠😠😠😈😈👿👿🤬
I have a theory what is your fourth channel?
Pokémon X.
The dumbest man alive
That's a weird looking Garchomp
Is bacteria a Pokemon or does ot like not exist or somthing
if I would eat a pokemon I would  eat grimer which is slime ,slime is made of glue and glue is made from horses  so if I eat grimer im eating a horse .so isnt grimer a horse pokemon?
thats not garchomp thats gebite
Its a fact that they eat pokermon
i want to eat an appleton
That intro by itself ruined my childhood and is going to give me nightmares
4:15
Mega metagross is not only not a legendary it also gross
You just ruined my childhood
But the one that Gary caught *WOULD MAKE A EXCELLENT DINNER*
in England an American farm they are goats people also eat them
I showed the thumbnail to my friends who loves pokemons, they weren't so happy lmao
People dont eat Pokemon
Wrongggggg
You quit ruining everything cuz when we find your house and we me and my brother are my friend we're going to end game you not like like an end game you like just destroy a whole thing that you're doing you continue more it was asking me my brother and my friend mad can you just do one video something good about that thing also on subscribe and I just like this video
matpat has gone of the deep end
“Eat your Pokémon” ??? You probably have no brain
I got lost at 4:57 😂
Firstly how would pokemon feed in the wild, Ekans and Arbok should have a venom potent enough completely paralyse the victim instantly before it starts to eat. Its main menu would be ratatta, spearow, pikachu(maybe)  You could do a pokemon food web XD, it will be insane.
Can't assume they walk steps to hatch eggs..., if not how wild pokemon grow their young
Flaffy as sheep =)
bone app the teeth
.99$ a second feeling like
And no freedom's or it's rights????
Well would u have an abortion...  Hmmm no house no luxury and good care hmmm.....
That's a can do I don't dare do ah but what if I could @ normal room temperature
Yeah in Canada ah aha ah was ah
Hey wi just thought we were all hungry and home's to
Thought for food drive usa
wtf isthis video
I think the reason why eating pokemon urks people so much is that most have a dog's intelligence and personality. I mean I would still eat them but I can't imagin a big number of people around me would. Meat is meat so I guess it's fine
Everything can be eaten  but some food can only be eaten once
Thank you matpat! Now i want to eat magikarp for dinner
i'm just thinking of someone training an appleten, and some kid just picking it up and eating it
What I want to know is which Pokemon are technically edible, but generally aren't eaten, like dogs, cats, and horses (at least in the US). Are there Pokemon where the answer is unclear, and it depends on who you ask, like rabbits? Do Pokemon that would generally be considered carnivores eat other Pokemon? Ugh, every answer I get about the Pokemon world spawns like twenty new ones.
no
I'm kind of triggered that he said mukrow instead of murkrow
who asks these questions?  yucky
He has three friends me myself and I
you can eat klaft
are talking about food or Pokemon
So are we forgetting the fact that most of the pokemon listed are region exclusives? Meaning they'd only be eaten in that region, so no, Mudsdale would be eaten in either Kanto or Johto, because there are NO Mudsdale in those regions, same goes for Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, etc. Same goes for the real world as you LITERALLY SAID IN YOUR OWN VIDEO
And then there are the Unowns, the Pokemon alphabet, who can be easily distinct from any other Pokemons.
Uuh- correction applin is NOT the apple, it is just a worm inhabiting that apple!
MAKE 4 FLAVORS OF THEORY OS
I hate you why do you eat pokemon
The trouble with hoothoot is owls are predators. We don't eat predator animals because their diet makes them taste awful.
We all know Brock would like to eat himself some nurse joy. And of course all the married nurse joys get eaten all the time especially the ones with kids
Quick reminder to never eat a Crawdaunt. I heard somewhere they smell Dis-Gus-Ting.
Eating pokemon, WAIT IN REAL LIFE WE EAT POKEMON AAAAAAAAAAA
Would there be a completely different reaction from the fans or the characters from the show when someone asks them this..  Hey would you like to try an espeon for dinner I heard it's delicious to devour.
If Pokemon made the farming games he was talking about would they name the milk moo moo milk
Objection! On your point of Medium Fast vs Medium Slow you forgot that early on Medium Slow Pokémon actually grow faster than Medium Fast Pokémon. Just a small inaccuracy, but I figured I'd point it out. It takes far less time to raise a Medium Slow Pokémon from level 1-50 then it would take a Medium Fast Pokémon.
Mudbray was also used as a farm animal in sun and moon
Livestock are not slaughtered for meat as adults. When "mature" livestock are slaughtered for meat, they are not mature in the sense of being adults. They are not biologically adults, nor are they adults by human standards, as they are the equivalent of minors. They are what's called "sexually mature", which means they have reached puberty. They're adolescents, not adults. Beef cattle reach puberty at around 13 - 15 months, but are slaughtered at around 18 months, which is roughly equivalent to a 15-year-old human.  This is not to say that there isn't adult livestock meat on the market. When dairy cows are killed when they stop producing milk, their meat is sold. That is adult beef. But that is a byproduct of the dairy industry. Dairy beef, especially that of adults, is not the kind people prefer. People prefer adolescent beef from beef breeds.
It’s not Skid-Do it’s Skid-Doe  Just like how it’s not a Pi-Jit-Spin-Ner  So Skiddo pronounced Skid-Doe And Pigey pronounced Pij-ee NOT a Piget Spinner
What if people want mythical legendary food
the way matpat butchers most of the pokemon names XD
Something else that makes this interesting is that some pokemon offer natural byproducts such as Slowpoke's tails fall off and they don't even feel pain if the tail is removed and they just grow back, or some grass type pokemon naturally produce their own vegetables or fruit that can be harvested without harm to the pokemon.
Me looking at my Shiny Tarros MMMmmMmmm RoTtDen  StEaK(3:32)
I think that The porch is not hoothoot, it is torchick    because it’s a chicken
Food theory is now game theory confirmed
I would really prefer if you didn't eat me. Please!
Mat is so effeminate!
What?   Pokemon are creatures you are savage Pokemon are not food What do you Eat your pet Psycho pants
I don’t get the joke at 10:00 . How does that show they don’t think of logistics? It makes sense to me about coughing (probably spelt wrong for the Pokémon)
Me watching this while drinking milk
Um no you should not eat your Pokémon
I just started violet and got two mon one said it legs fall off and test bad, other said it claws fall off and or were used in cooking, lol so there you go yes you can eat them, am also thinking some mon parts or like spice in this game
NOOOOOOooooooo WHYYYYYY!!!!!!!?????? 😭😭😭😭😭
Barbacue Bobasuar Chicken delight Chichador Chamalander stuffed with cabbage pickeled Pichau and Squirto with squash. There are so many 😋 Pokemon to eat! No wonder why Ash never gets hungry!
YOURE NOT EATING ME!!!  *Pikachu uses lightning bolt*  NOW UR COOKED
Am I the only person who thinks this is amoral
107 facts about Pokemon actually did mention that Pokemons are in fact being eaten. Including Magikarp
lol 3:17 so cute those diglett sandwiches!!!
Remember kids. You can eat anything, the trick is eating it twice
Better yet: which fire type would give the best hot sauce?
Wow, good on you for telling us something that Pokémon fans already know.   That was sarcastic.
Why would growth rate matter if it only applies to Pokémon levels which is gained by battling which Matpat said we’re not valid which he also goes back on his word when considering mudbrays evolution
OwO
"It's almost like they think through the logistics of this world" Me: *flashes back to Ash's Pikachu defeating an Onix with Thunderbolt* 💀  Yes, almost. 😂
We eat poke waifu
Gotta eat em all.
Ahh yes mudbray I love eating mud
Lol
Tell us what bigotry is
Did he seriously pronounce Skiddo's name as "Skidoo"? It's like "kiddo", there's only 1 "o" in the name, why the "oo"? XD  Also, yeah, eating plant Pokémon would NOT be vegetarian at all, because even though they are Grass types, I think plant Pokémon are TECHNICALLY still ANIMALS, simply having evolved to RESEMBLE plants, like some insects like stickbugs and leaf bugs and orchid mantises. Even some mineral Pokémon like Geodude and Roggenrola are still animals and not actual minerals, they simply have evolved to RESEMBLE rocks, in fact their final evolutions resemble reptiles, same thing with the Rolycoly evo line. The only Pokémon that I think are not animals are actually the artificial ones, like Magnemite, Voltorb, Porygon, Magearna etc., those that are confirmed man-made or resemble robots enough that they can be considered non-animals. Not sure about Koffing/Weezing or Grimer/Muk, since those also seem to be man-made but aren't robots either. They're more like mutated animals. I like the theory that Grimer are corrupted Ditto, which in turn are failed clones of Mew, which is definitely an animal. I do consider slime Pokémon animals, as slimes (the creature) in many fantasy universes are considered animals (or at least creatures, you get it, right?), so Gulpin/Swalot and other slimes like that still count as animals imo. Also unsure about Trubbish/Garbodor, maybe they're in the same boat as Koffing/Weezing and Grimer/Muk (minus the corrupted Ditto part). Regardless, almost all Pokémon, whether plant, mineral or animal, are actually animals, and only a handful of them are robots. I do know that apparently Fomantis/Lurantis are supposed to be a plant resembling a mantis, thus doing a switcheroo on the orchid mantis being the opposite of that, but really, there are no plants in the real world that can walk around on their own, nor think or make choices, while animals can. So, logically/realistically, Fomantis/Lurantis are indeed actual animals and not plants. Even Ghost Pokémon are animals that simply use the power of antimatter to be able to transcend through objects, but since they have genders and lay eggs just like Eevee or Bellsprout (plant egg, really?), it means they are animals.  Basically, what I can say is, if a Pokémon can naturally lay an egg, it's an animal. If it doesn't have a gender and isn't legendary (coz gods won't breed for you puny humans), then its existence as an animal can be put into question. Since Ditto will have to lay the egg for that Pokémon then, and since Ditto is an animal, naturally it lays eggs, even if it's an egg containing a non-animal like a Magnemite or a Bronzor. Of course, there are exceptions to this like Staryu which is clearly an animal, but genderless, but with these cases, simply use your common sense and knowledge for the answer. The gender and natural egg laying ability thing is merely to determine whether a plant/mineral/robot/non-animal-looking-thing is an animal or not. Didn't mean for this to be so long, got a bit carried away lol
Forgot seafood
matpat (says that nurse joy is a pokemon) matpat (put nurse joy in the part where he mentions humans) 3:12
why was there a gible instead of a garchomp
its gotta be bedoof
awwww I wanted to see what seafood would be best too
Eating wailord ok matpat I didn't think you would be a poacher
Sushi out of magikarp and other fish Pokémon
Militank
I hate crab
4:33 another example:in Uruguay (my country) there's lots of cow meat, pork, etc bc we have land, but ,in peru they usually eat cuy (a.cousin of hamsters) or alpacas bc that are the animals that they can easily find and breed
Eating Pokémon animation
That's crazy please moree
Brainqueen be like
Poor Pikachu
Now why would you eat Pikachu. Especially why would ASH eat his Pikachu. Pikachu is his first Pokemon. Please change the thumbnail to something not like that...
Mudbray and mudsdale are likely that heavy because their composition is largely not conventional flesh. I'm not sure how edible they are...
No trainer would eat their pet unless he is petting them to eat them but seriously no trainer would eat their own pet for example in our world we dont eat cat or dog so in pokemon they woydnt eat ther pet pokemon like pikachue their not used as food bit crabby is a crab so u know thir is no animals here that means it is allowed to it pig cow and crab fish type of pokemon u know in our world these exist but in pokemon this does not pikemon work as animals with special powers and it is eatable of the animals which is allowed to eat like ib our world
Bruh every animal is pokemon not even a normal animal is here it wpuld make sense to eat pokemon there  EDIT:she is a pokemon that means no canniblism but still she needs ro be a forbiddan one to eat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAEBETX4PYs
Can I eat pikachu for dinner then?
did anybody else read "Eat Your Pokemon!" in the "Who's that Pokemon?" voice?
whtyyyyyyyyyyy
How dare how dare you!!!!!!!!!!!🤬😡😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🔥🔥🔥😾😾💢💢💢💢💢

It was also mentioned in one of the games (and on a Pokémon card) that Sharpedo were used to make sushi.
3:22 *Rodert Downey Jr image* He doesn’t know about My Pokémon Ranch
"Apparently Barraskewda’s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too." Lol🤣
Episodes of the Pokemon anime depict lobster, pizza, and other real world food being eaten.   And, as you were reading the statistic about crab and lobster consumption, I was eating leftovers of a crab/crawfish/pork sausage boil, so I was like "that can't be right!" But,  I live in Florida, a state surrounded on three sides by water, and a lot of our diet here is seafood... or, more accurately waterfood, since Floridians care more about the preparation than we do "freshwater" or "saltwater." BBQ gator after a high school wrestling tournament? One of the best meals I've ever had.
Every person or pokemon are vegetarians
ahhhhhhh
The Brock in me would love to eat Nurse Joy 😏
No eat pokemon😢😭💔
What about a theory about pokemon food like the global food for pokemon. What kind of food can be eaten by carnivore,  herbivores,  and plants
Imagine you found out that you ate a legendary or a shiny. Now you know why your meal was so expensive.
How about Miltank steak Mareep Lamb and Pigey eggs and pigey meat
I have a question can you do animal theory because I feel like the Pokémon animals except that they just evolved
Imagine if the vegan teacher watch this
Rowlet is a borb so he's like piplup the other borb pokemon.
foie gras you say like THE GRAY STUFF
is it just me or is it creepy how theirs Mr beast on there who did a deadly diet matpat theorized about
If pokemon die on their own humans eat it
why u making them suffer
I must say, your thumbnail has a pikachu, but electric pokemon are the least edible
This is a good theory and all, but I think Matpat forgot to take one crucial thing into consideration. Regions. Certain pokemon are home to and more commonly found in certain regions. Sure in Kalos Gogoat would be the main source for dairy, but in Johto Miltank would be the main source for dairy. Or how each region would have their own pidgey clone source of meat. In Johto it would be Hoothoot, but in Kalos it would be Fetchling.
15:14
7:34 garchomp??
Bellsprout is a peashooter from PvZ
What about Torchic meat for chicken huh?
Might as well eat Nurse Joy because she's a pokemon too.
Murray is in a far in pokomon sun and moon
13:50 take Sunflora for example, it would be more like “Sunfauna!”
Whoever tried to eat the nurse sure is a killjoy
Here is a food theory: eating Godzilla meat
"and a... poultry.. 1.9%"  5:58
😂 lolololololololo
Wait wot
What am I watching and how dare u do that to like by he's too.cut
Bruh how is that happen
i love that you answer all the questions we dont need answers to. its utterly silly and i love watching
Hi
me after eating donkey meat: my does this **mud** bray meat taste like dirt?
If you can eat pokemon I would eat all of my trash pokemon
nurse joy probably tastes like fish tacos :P
hoot hoot just looks like a disney land turkey leg
Wait…APPLIN ARE NOT MADE OF APPLE. THEY ARE BUGS!!
but bro... what about taste? the taste of MUDbray would probably be something closer to mud no? Who would be okay with eating that? Maybe is scarce times but definetly not in modern society...
I love how old Matt always used to stop image smiling man if he said turn down the mouth a little bit to make him grinning at you sadly
7:35 he says garchomp and shows a gabite lol
Hey actually one in one episode of the anime Ash dresses up as a very real depiction of a cow that means there are real animals but we just don't see them
They are so advanced in Pokemon and yet can't print or grow meat?
When you die in minecraft uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The pidgy clones are actually referred as regional birds
MatPat: "Bigger isn't always bigger" Me: I hope that applies to me (5'4)
If I was a pokemon no one wpuld eat me. Because I am slim and 5'4.
Glich
🤮
Wait what
OBJECTION!  Hoothoot is an owl, owls are carnivores, the meat of carnivores taste REALLY bad, so I doubt anyone would eat it unless starving
Mmm.  Chansey.  Egg and meat. Cherubi pie.
fish?
And needless to say all fish no holes bared are hunted for food . Asian food staple nessisty
I watch Pokemon in my grandma in Brazil and when I watch again in U.S  to realize that they are eating pokemon 🥺.
The real question is what shiny Pokémon taste like
If I had a Pokémon in real life I would do everything to protect it
7:35 I don’t think that’s garchomp…
I honestly hate that my favorite bird pokemon is the most efficient option to eat as a chicken stand in.
The question is can you eat torchick
I would eat lopunny 😏 but not in the way you think
Pokemon are edible nurse joy is a pokemon does that mean that People Will eat Nurse joy
NEVE EAT POKEMON >:0
THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😡
Bro fidough would be scrumptious
Dam imagine eating fried Zapdos
That vegan teacher wouldn't be happy about this 😬
Pi-pikachu?
So um, what’s eevee supposed to be Rabbit? Bunny?
The problem with skidoo, is only available in Kalos, that is why it is in x and y, and not sun and moon, which has miltank.
a
12:02 yes we found one
Youj APOLIGIZE to those poor pokemon!😡
im scared cause im a purpule pokemon dont eat me im too young i have 69 years
Well.. OK.
When lechonk was revealed everyone was thinking of making hot dogs out of it
Mcdarkrai Kalos fried combusken Burger kingler Subwailmer
3:03 that background is giving me a very stage feeling of deja vu
Where is the egg type of food
Well matpat you could just get dame buglers
I just thought of this wich probaly deserves to comment on the game theory channel buuut I don’t wanna forget so what if all the legendary pokemons (expect mewtwo of course) are just Pokémon that are only one because we ate all the rest if that’s the case this will change everything about Pokémon
You are evil
nooooooooooo
I wonder what hoothoot would taste like
What would be the best characters to have in a Pokémon Farm towel for milk does a cow Pokémon and if there's a chicken Pokémon that I don't know about that also be the best option cuz it produces milk no I meant to say at least eggs that you can sell for your farm business and cow for milk but the pig eat a spam for pork but you can buy two pigs keep them breeding and every time you go to SAR a pig you'll make sure that there's always still two pigs left to keep breathing to get more pigs and more that's the best option of how you should Farm
Gen 7 anime They farm mudbray
I don't eat meat and I 100% will not eat pokemon 👎
3:21 Pokemon Ranch already exists
Hate to break it to you MatPat(hope i spelled that right) but i have my own copy of that pokemon 'encyclopedia' shown at 12:25 and i dont really trust that thing if you did get info from there😓 i dont remember llt at the moment but it SERIOUSLY got some stuff wrong. Oh yeah they have a section where theyshowed all the pokemon of a particular region, in this case sinnoh, and they put a picture of porygon 2 and wrote porygon z on top. This dex isnt even showing pokemon that can be found there. NO SIR THEY ARE GIVING POKEMON FROMM THAT REGION!! Plus for the character profiles they put cilan as having 2 pokemon, not 3, leaving out stunfisk. They also wrote he had a dwebble, not a crustle, even though it evolved in the anime! THEY EVEN FRICKIN WROTE HE ANF HIS BROTHERS GYM BADGE IS THE INSECT BADGE😤😡THAT IS BURGHS BADGE GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT JEEZ! So yeah dont trust that book
Well this in funny and a nice theory
I saw in pokemon sun and moon that they have a fried magikarp that they'll eat
You can eat frogs when I was young I ate frog soup you can eat the water frog pokemon
I suppose these are the "best" sources and maybe I just missed it but this doesn't really take into account regional availability. Some pokemon can't be raised in large numbers in certain environments so it's highly unlikely you'd find something like a mudbray in say kanto. aside from that rarity also comes into play as hoothoot is at least far less common than a pidgy or spearow which can be found all around their region.
Well donkey meat is sold but we dont eat it off as long as its not delegacy or we have been scammed to buy it and its fast to grow and cost efficient but still..... We , don't eat it!
7:37 Is it just me or isn't that a Gabite?
Niiiice
Does Mongolia just not exist??
14:40 CANNIBALISM WEEK
🧍🏻‍♂️ I want you to be a teacher
This should have been on game theory
Slowpake tails grow back fast, and its doesnt harm it! (it says that in the games)
Ya but you didn't account for each region, hoot hoot probably wouldn't be found in every region because of climate differences.
Dhelmise : 👁️👄👁️
I'm vegetarian
I call the pidgey clones the regional bird Pokémon just like I call the ratata idk how to spell it the regional normal Pokémon or rodent I guess
Under  applies apple is
One of my neighbors has chickens and I doubt their yard is much bigger than mine.  You can easily buy some chicks at a farmers supply store and have your own eggs within a few months as long as you buy the eggs producing kind and not get a rooster mixed in their by accident.
Fun fact they do actually have real animals which would be where they get the food and also you’re awesome
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
every one calles early bird pokemon in each region regional birds.he calls them "pidgy clones!":
Pokemon have been raised for harvesting (dairy, foilage, regrowabe slowpoke tails apparently) for some time, and pokemon hunt other pokemon…but it’s honestly poor taste to eat your party members for the same reason why you wouldn’t eat a pet pig even if you enjoy bacon.
i would definitely eat nurse joy 🤤
I wouldn't hesitate eating Appleton
Predatory birds typically aren't good tasting, might have to rethink the Owl pokemon option
What the fu** is wrong you
While Pokémon are sometimes eaten by humans (and occasional vice versa), I think these would be fairly uncommon occurrences.  The reason is that the Pokémon world is fairly advanced, and one would expect them to have fairly advanced methods of creating synthetic meat, which could easily be cheaper than real meat.  Tofu is also a great meat substitute in terms of efficiency.  Also, since just about all Pokémon could be dangerous to humans, I doubt Pokémon are being killed in slaughterhouses, but rather based on the look of meat in the anime, farmed Pokémon die of natural causes and are made into soylent green-type products.
I can’t eat lobster because I am allergic to it but I can eat crab and I eat it alot
I hope this is on Game Theory, too.
I want to eat Mewtwo
I just came from the nurse joy is a Pokémon video... My brain: Hmmmm I should eat my Pokémon eh? I wonder what nurse joy tastes like?
Pokémon
K ima about to chop my pikachu plush
Could exp candy help the evolution problem
My childhood
fun fact i most ofa fan on chaotic tcg
Teres is a Pokémon ranch
Ahaha
Does that mean people eat geodude?
In pokemon, level isn't equal to age. If it was, evolution would have to be taken into account as their final evolution would be considered the point they're mature. Also depending on their trainer they could take a few hours to centuries to level up.
I feel criminal watching this
Pokemon
fun fact : even in the games people eat pokemon
The only problem I see here is that this is taking consideration if pokemon were in this world, to be honest I'm more curious of what would be the diets of each region after all I doubt that Kanto has a steady supply of skiddo/gogoat milk since no skiddo or gogoat naturally live there.
I really thought they were Vegetarians
I will never eat my Pokémon you crazy man😵‍💫
4:59 Wasn’t expecting Homelander, Frenchie, and Butcher to pop up 🤣🤣
Wait so u can eat miss joy?🧐
Being honest this is Fd up
imagine eating contests where you have to eat an entire hoot hoot in 3 hours😂
There's regular birds you don't have to stuff a pidove down your gullet!
POV: the vegan teacher is watching.......
0:23 reminds me of that locksmith and noggin thumb nail years before this video kool
YOU MONSTER!!!! YOU DIDN'T EVEN EAT THE APPLE PART OF APPLIN!!!!
Wait, you used Gabite instead of Garchomp
its game ,film ,food theory in one!
when you finally find out why they call it lamb chops and not sheep chops from a freaking food theory video and not both your parents working in the restaurant industry for years🤦🏻‍♀
I personally think they eat torchic and other starters and that's why they aren't usually found in the wild
When you watch this video and find out a pound of pig meat costs 1 dollar *and 69 cents*
I mean ash
Ahs actually eats a magiccarp
In the middle of this I thought I heard my teacher talking oh wait that was just a video
Did anyone notice the gabite instead garchomp
the anime shows magikarp sashimi
You is italy or inglesh
6:50 sorry mate but if relicanth is in any way realistic to real coelacanth then you won't get any caviar out of them coelacanth give live birth the eggs hatch inside of them an all the babys just swim out
What about Snorlax
Yum
they say people eat pokemon to show that their that worlds animals
Hey it took me a lot of pokeballs to catch a gabite in pokemon go
If nurse joy is actually a pokemon you could literraly eat them and if you could will be or not a cannibal
Yyyyuuuuuuummmmm
You have ruined my childhood
Haha, Yummy yummy Jinx— Wait.. that sounds wrong. Don’t take it the wrong way! Too late..
“Welcome to the world of Pokémon!” Me with a scarily accurate Nurse Joy impression trying to copy MatPat: “Welcome to the world of PokémoOOOO OH GOd”
Does this mean people would eat Nurse Joy ???? :0
Me eating a steak while I start watching you talking until your tung comes off
you know, it says that miltank's milk might be somewhat cost effective because it is VERY calorically dense.
What about lactose people what should they do for diary asking for a friend 🙄🙄😉😉😊
Don’t tell peta
I think a Cow Pokémon would be best Because of steak
The intro scared me for life lol
Shiny applins taste sour
Mattpat: steaks don't grow on trees you know. Me: FACTS
Hey guys, did you know that vaporeon is the best pokemot to eat out
That beginning just added more evidence to my theory that Mattpat is a SCP.
No your wrong they dont eat the Pokémon they eat each other
I would eat magikarp
this is turning into how to start a farm for pokemon. it also has a few ways to start a real farm
I enjoyed eating sosages while watching this
....ya know, it JUST hit me that me eating lamb chops is me eating a baby/youngin....(i hate veal though, so calves are safe, lmfao...oh goodness 🙈) can't believe this thought JUST occurred to me, smh, at the age of almost 28
Whole rotisseried eevee anyone? I hear they're best consumed when they've just hatched out of their eggs! 😏😈🤣🤣🤣
Gross.
I think Pokémons are just like ducks. They can be your friend, you can use them for battles (but this one is still weird for ducks-), they can be your meal or the source of your meal.
Taste is also important to what people eat and how well food sells. If these Pokemon with mud in the name actually taste like mud, they probably won't be used much.
Like my fifth grade teacher said: Everything’s edible if you’re brave enough!
I can just imagine a bunch of Pokémon trainers acting like vampires breaking into the Pokémon center and trying to eat nurse joy with Brock being the only one protecting her nurse joy your secret is out
Draganite tyranatar and garchomp Shows a picture of gabite
I don't eat Pokemon
You do know that eating Pokémon is illegal, right?
There's only one problem owls don't taste good so get back to the drawing board
He said beef was an animal it’s funny
Fire types are fresh
now I'm hungry
I don't eat cereal. But I'd certainly eat Theory O's.
actually, the weight in mudbray mostly comes from its heavy feet, and same with mudsdale
You forgot about tropious
The new moniker of food theorist suits you well sir
Bachelor Arie up does a Feen toothpaste go to not
Hoothoot wouldn’t be a great food option. Not only are owls illegal to eat, but they have a very potent taste because of them being carnivores.
none matpat doing that le me 2 + 2 =5
wer is itt
Evolution would probably actually be a good choice for farmers, since Pokémon can level up by eating rare candy, it's description in more recent entries just says that it's "packed with energy", probably meaning it's packed with nutrients, you can assume that they level up if they gain enough nutrients by just eating simple food, meaning, they also evolve just by eating, they just probably grow faster by fighting and that's why Pokémon trainers fight with them instead of feeding them all day.
Plants scream when they die, humans just don't have the ears to hear it. Plants also don't have any control and can't escape death by human or animal harvest. So eating Plants is just as bad as eating Meat. Just kidding lol.
One reason a lot of people might not each so much crab and lobster as much as we want, is that its so expensive T n T
This is like cooking class
Me walking into a hospital and asking to bye a food theory poky ball
that garchomp was a gabite.....
Why are you thinking about food isn't this gt
Zubat soup seems nice
Cool
why did i laugh so hard on "relicanth's caviar"?
we do not eat a lot of seafood..b.c its EXPENSIVE
"what is the tastiest pokemon"  me : well I saw your game theory vid so..NURSE JOY!!!
do you really think an animal named MUDbray would be eatable?
No no you should not eat your pokemon
him: why do we use specific animals as food? subtitles that his editor added: why do we use use special animals as food?
charmander has a charcoal-like taste, like if you cooked beef over a charcoal grill.
i was watching this when i was playing pokemon and mudbang is in my team
I honestly been aware that pokemon are eaten ever since I heard of Wishiwashi's Pokedex entry
0:26 YOU MONSTER! You should have waited for it to evolve into apple pie
Game theory: Nurse Joy IS a pokemon! Food theory: Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon! Me: hmm....
I dont eat shellfish and pork because I am muslim
#eatyourpokemon
One thing to consider is that Medium Slow groups actually level up faster in the beginning than Medium Fast groups. I believe up until level 50 or so. So in my opinion you have the bird groups backwards. Though none of the Pidgey Clones look very tasty 🤣
I mean, eating a pokenon is no different than eating a deer or cow. We just refuse to see them the same way
PETA in the pokemon world probably exists
7:34 That’s a gabite, not a garchomp.
MandJTV watching this: “Miltank, you don’t need to theorize about that”
All the item and slime based Pokemon were smart; they made SURE they can’t be eaten.
Do one on geot simulator please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
It's actually been confirmed by a phone call you get in HGSS that people eat berries, buddy was wondering if the berries that his Geodude was eating were good and he was right. Soulsilver and Diamond are SKIDOOed(pokemon version of GOATed)
I can't believe anything in life anymore lol
One of miltanks pokedex entrys say that if you drink too much you look like miltank
Me: Who the heck eats Pokémon Matpat: YOU CAN AND SHOULD EAT YOUR POKÉMON Me: why not just eat that fish  Man do I need to actually watch the video, Well that was 2 years ago..
At 3:52 he uses "use" twice
'I like my food hot. So i choose you, charmander.'
i think you forgot to take into account if the  pokemon is a predator. there's a reason we don't eat howl irl.
Peta about to send a seize and assist
You said garchomp but showed a picture of a Gabite
Noooo not the applins🍎 you ate them all matpat!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Miltank: Moomoo Milk Tauros: Steak and Beef Greninja: Frog legs Krabby: Crab legs Crawdaunt and Corphish: Crawdads/lobster Gogoat: Goat meat/milk Grumpig, Tepig evolution line: Pork Farfetch’d: Chicken (and leeks) Tropius: BANANAS Applin evolution line: Apples/apple pie Sawsbuck, Stantler: Venison Magikarp and various other fish Pokemon: Salmon, carp, various other fish Huntail: Eels (because people do eat eels) Galvantula: Yes, people do in fact eat tarantulas Squirtle: Turtle  Alright, that’s the most I could think of  Edit: As a First Nations person, I’m a bit angry at myself for not considering BOUFALLANT sooner, ITS WHAT MY ANCESTORS HUNTED AND ATE SO OFTEN
This thumbnail… it’s just… “What the heck!?”
If you look it up Google says that the do infact eat there Pokémon
The editori used gabite and no gartshomp
4:32 He misspoke lol " *Beef* is actually one of the most profitable *animals* "
Me: don't you dare touch Lucario
This video is silly pokemon dont bean eat
i like to imagine there's a clip out there of Hungrybox yelling "NOOO" at 2:10
Fun fact at 7:37 Mat said Garchomp but put a picture of Gabite in stead of Garchomp
4:56 It's like with Skiddo and Miltank. Skiddo will need more labor so it makes sense for farmers to have miltank
platypuses who produce both milk and eggs and meat: YOUR NEVER GONNA CATCH ME ALIVE
No, you should not eat your Pokémon. Your Pals, on the other hand... They're really tasty and there's a full world of them, so...
Get a tropius and eat it bananas
Fun fact: Pokémon has chickens, in “Let’s Go Eevee!” You make curry’s, and if I’m not mistaken, it’s chicken.
Pokemon is the only anime world I would proudly be a vegan O_o.......
Why do I actually want to eat a bellsprout? Like those dudes seem tasty
dey don't have animals den de pokemon are de meat like who eat animals
professer oak tried to eat ashes crab
Not sure if Hoothoot being so heavy alone would make it viable. birds of prey have disgusting and often unsafe meat for consumption. Honestly shocked that the Torchic line wasn't considered.
yes,  you are insane
Me : 😮ඞ 𝕯𝖊𝖑𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖔𝖚𝖘
I showed my little brother this and he got traumatized
Well I'm a vegetarian wait what does bulbasaur bulb taste like
I feel that so much
Fun fact: why do you have two channels
Aren’t you the game theory because you sound the same because of the Cheerios it’s a game theory
Pokevegetarians disliked this video
Wow we were right food theory does make these make these kind of vides
I ate crockoache, grasshoppers and bettles before.....but owls?
im just watching pokemon politics
I honestly didn't hear a single word after 6:25 .. the song is so cool !
I know this video was a while ago, but Mat, you really should do more work on your Pokemon theories. I know the amount of work that you do for your theories, and I'm sure you do lots of work here too, but the number of mistakes in this video is just unbelievable.  You said Garchomp, but you showed a Gabite picture. I really don't know how you made this mistake, since it's not like it's that hard to find a Garchomp picture, and Gabite pictures shouldn't be popping up that often when looking for Garchomp ones.  You say that evolving your Pokemon wouldn't be worth it for farmers, but why would it not be? It doesn't take THAT much effort to train a Pokemon to evolve it, and there are even methods that you can use to raise a Pokemon's level without having to battle with it, and evolving Pokemon most often gets you a much larger Pokemon to slaughter.  I would harp on the pronunciation of Pokemon, but that's not all that important, and you didn't make any egregious mistakes in pronunciation like pronouncing Golisopod as Guh-lee-so-pod.  Mudbray and Mudsdale are mentioned as eating dirt and mud. Animals that eat dirt and mud for their nutrients typically have very poor meat. And while you COULD eat Mudsdale for its eat if you have to, there are much better options for meat in the same area. In fact, Miltank, which you opted to replace with Mudbray/Mudsdale, are more efficient because they produce milk and meat, and they have more meat sooner. As soon as Miltank hatch, they have more meat on their bones than Mudbray, which automatically means that Miltank is a better food source, even if you don't account for the fact that Mudbray/Mudsdale's meat would be pretty bad.  Finally, you ignore the fact that Pokemon, especially in the games, can reproduce REALLY fast. Like, thousands of times faster than real animals. At most, you're waiting half an hour or so between leaving your Pokemon to produce an egg and actually hatching that egg. Because of this, slaughtering the babies (don't take that out of context) would be far more efficient, especially for Pokemon that immediately hatch into their adult forms like Miltank, Tauros, and Bouffalant.
Got to take flavor into account. I imagine mudbray/mudsdale would taste like mud.
I want to eat a miltank.
Sus
carnivore pokemon also should eat herbivore pokemon
Why is gabite there?
:(
No
I just remembered there is paper but also tree pokemons but normal trees as well
What You Mean By That?         (¬‿¬)
Uhh mushray eats mud so ya that’s not going to be a good meal
My childhood noooooo
7:34when you said garchomp, you've actually shown gabite
Rip chimken reason why it’s short lived
12:48 hmm, metagross is my favorite legendary.
7:34 That’s a Gabite on screen instead of Garchomp
I mean like just cuz mud-bray and hoot hoot have a heavy weight doesn’t mean there’s a lot of meat. There both tiny your just gonna have meat so dense it breaks your teeth😭
People eating Pokémon is cannibalism.  It's pure cannibalism. I just watched your last Pokémon video.
Game theory is a girl?
When I saw the title I was like:yo Mario's not a sociopath u are
How about insect pokemon? What is the best insect to eat in the pokemon world?
WHY DID YOU EAT APPILIN!!!!!!1!!!!??????///!!!
If ever get the chance to visit a pokemon theme park, i will demand some spicy fried hoot hoot.
The thumbnail made me cry because I have a heart for animals pikachu noooooooooooo
WAIT,, GAME THEORY IS A GIRL??
I love fish dab
thats a lie
PROTEIN COMES FROM PLANTS BRUH YOU CAN GET PROTEIN FROM PLANTS THATS THE ORIGINAL SOURCE
"Yes, pokemon are packed with nutrients and protein, and we don't use them as pets, we see them as edible and delicious."
Makes Sense looking at you Vanillish Evo. line..
A t 7:32 matpat called Gabite Garchomp
14:40        Of course we can! She is the moistier of them.............
So, I  just tried out a quiz about what pokemon i am, and the results, were: Charizard
Your not factoring in ditto for the animals , and ditto must be the best food
7:33 matt said Garchomp but a gabite was shown
Pokepizza
Did everyone forget about gen 2/ the remakes where they ate slowpoke tails which meant eating the pokemon even them eating a magikarp(I believe)
Well i knew this because appletun pokedex entry says: (it's body is covered in sweet necturn, and the skin on it's back is especially yummy, children used to have it as a snack.) Pretty disturbing right? So therefor it's not a theory. Wasted video matpat
I live in Australia and i have never seen hoggling (2 year old sheep) or mutton (3 years plus) meat for sale which is weird, as u say it isn't optimal to slaughter younger animals. i wonder why lamb is and exception here.
Why not eat your son while we're at it, MatPat?
if i were in the pokemon world i would just be vegetarian cause i dont want to fricking eat a cute bird
I don’t know why but I like food theroy more than game theroy
i do like medium rare grilled tauros and spicy torchicken
You ever wonder what pokemon you take on your adventure eat?
no thanks
matpat:the only thing that out class it are legendary's   show's legendary's and a mega metagross that is not a legendary   ps:just pointing this out
One thing you didn't mention about Mudbray: since it's based on the donkey, we can assume it probably has the same sort of instincts as one irl. This would mean that having at least 1 Mudbray would become a necessity for most ranchers in order to defend their livestock as the Mudbray would automatically attack any animal that's not a tamed livestock (Poochyena and Zangoose come to mind as immediate dangers to a ranch). This would also make evolving Mudbray relatively autonomous as it would simply get exp from defending the herd.
Now I'm hungry
Nurse joy is a Pokémon so can I uhhhh… eat nurse joy? (I’m sorry)
Not only that but mudbray can also be self used for labor ie used for plowing a field or other forms of labor
Did they know they were gonna hunt far'fetch to extinction when they named it, did they change the name after or is it a morbid coincidence that the close to extinct pokemon is named far'fetch
If the Pokemon Region is Based on China then All the Pokemons are Foods even dog/cats/bats ... everything
7:37 that’s Gabite, not garchomp
What
Here's a question for you... Do a plantpokemon bleed if you cut it
L.l
Apple
matpat I have to wonder.. does nurse joy eat pokemon?
I will eat slowpoke is very yummy
I like the idea that Pokemon are spirits given physical form so they're essentially equal to humans, and that they appeared thousands of years ago and slowly outcompeted regular animals, so now the only place regular animals exist is on farms and nature preserves, so people just eat normal animals.
oh no, whats that i think i hear the worlds biggest hypocrites  *here comes the peta mobile*    as per usual your videos are funny and entertaining
Is there a joke I'm missing with Koffing?
that was a gabite not a garchomp #owned
Alright peta come on out we all know you're here
I know a lot of goat farmers actually. Goats are becoming more common especially for people who mainly farm just for their family
2:21  me and some pelicans: "we may die, but we will try"
what about pescatarians?
whos gonna tell mat that applin is a worm inside an apple shell
Remember that the Pokemon Anime isn't canon and will never be canon so it's not logical to use them as evidence in a theory about the games
I wanna go through a jungle and eat every living thing that i saw just like charles darwin
and even plants
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 why why this video just makes me sad it has ruined my childhood
11:00 the sun and moon is mising
Well ... Do you see ANY other animal other than Pokémon? There's farms with tauros and milktanks. Most if not all birds and fish are Pokémon. And i bet that grass type can be used as wombo combo meat and veggies.
Dubwool are cute
Mat pat Bad boy
Bad boy
Mine is noodles/wheat
If you wanted to eat eggs you can have different flavours in it like a kinder suprise lol
Do not eat pokemon you are gross😠
Chickens and Eutherians are both terrible animals to farm, and humans only farm because there are no better options and there are literally no other decent-sized terrestrial grass (including grass seed) eaters. They are all too intelligent and excessively warm-blooded, and some have unhelpful reproductive systems with low reproductive potential creating an entire massive industry for breeding, and a bunch of other things.   Really the best food source in the Pokemon is a single-souled (has one soul/species, completely avoids guilt, and also means they cooperate more) organism that can live in space/the air, as pokemon don't obey conservation of energy and just need time to order their own energy into meat.
Noooooooo not Jigglypuff!111<
You should try to eat ETERNAMAX ETERNATUS
I don’t think I want to eat my Pokémon…
Shouldn't this be in game theory?
just because something is heavy doesent mean that there is much of it like led and iron
I like how this theory can actually apply to Food, Game and Film theory if you think about it enough
Evolve it so you have more food.
I tried but I can't eat ghosts 👻 🤣🤣🤣
I wonder what Charmander would taste like
I am kind of surprised that nobody ever talks about eating bug pokemon. Bugs are super nutritious and usually thrive even in places we don't want them to, the only problem ever seems like bugs are just too small to be worth the time. Bug pokemon don't have this problem. I would be surprised if someone out there wasn't eating non-poisonous bug types like caterpie (6lbs) , wurmple (8lbs), or especially grubbin (9lbs), considering they are all medium fast growth and hatch in UNDER 5,000 steps.
Fun fact: ash is called "sasha" in the french version.
this is oddly a rather pleasant video. but i got one nitpick with these choices. they are fine in the region they are in but there is a chance that these choices might be difficult in other regions like you have mentioned briefly in regards to cows and goats. also you say evolving might cause too much trouble to bother but you also refer to gaining exp and leveling as the way age works. and most of those choices you choose evolve based on leveling. so either you have to still do pokemon battles or they accumulate exp, level, and evolve normally in a living world scenario regardless of battling.
I was in so much pain when he called dual types hybrid types and when he pronounced murkrow "muk-crow"
7:34 one of theses things are not like the others (far right)
...
The intro is lol
You should make a theory channel where it just talks about theories and it would be the fourth part of the circle
I also want a Pokémon game where other jobs are a thing like restaurants like and mabye a Pokémon contest league I miss thag
NOOOO! dont eat pikachu or any pokemon! please! DONT
Uhh what do you mean by not killing BCS like tropius is growing fruit so it's basically it
6:35 cursed
2012-2015-2017-2019-2022
Matpat: says that that's why we eat chickens and not ostriches Aussies: want an emu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrkeJvZ6Tr4
Don't eat animals and wouldn't eat pokemon
12:48 oh yeah, mega metagross, my favourite legendary
I think you forgot 3 things: culture of the consumers, domestication of the Pokémon and rarity of the Pokémon. I mean, just because a pokemon grows quickly or provides lots of meat doesn't mean it is so simple to take care of them, different cultures eat different things even if availability can be the same etc. Maybe I just missed something in the video as I was listening to it in the background.
Mat wouldn't game theory be your mother channel since it's bigger and older than this one and wouldn't film theory be like a grandmother due to its age
Now we know where Gary’s Raticate went.
I didn’t need to know this…
"Honey, we're having roast Arceus for dinner."
Fun fact slow poke tales actually grow back
If Nurse Joy were a Pokemon then she laid eggs too and that... err... very disturbing to imagine...
I’m so hungry right now that pikachu actually looks appetizing…      WHO WANTS TO PUNCH ME NOW?
What about fish?
Pokemon BBQ get you pokemon BBQ in professor oak's grill the meat is from Ash's pokemons. 🥓🥩🍗🍖🍔🌭🥪
Though MatPat while this theory is interesting the more nerdy/weebs that watch your channel might take eating nurse joy which is a fictional character a different way just saying smh
no, no, applins DONT grow on trees. they are worm like pokemon that LIVE INSIDE OF applels
anyone else notice matpat (or whoever was editing that part) used a picture of gabite instead of garchomp?
I'm not vegan, but I do eat plants, so I want to know which Pokemon would be best as a plant source.
Just a tip: exp candys could help them grow up faster, so maybe only consider incubation time
*mix with it's body fluid 😳😖😏😫🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Not even watching this; big no-no, pokemon are sentient creatures and your friends. Just nah.
Some people eat dogs, so what about smeargle? That's about all its good for...
Do you hav a chennel calld YouTubers theory?
Its funny because this isn’t even a theory anymore. Pokemon have been hinted at being consumed for a decade now but the biggest alarms were in sun/moon. I forget when and where but it had something to do with advertising in the malasada food shop windows
AYO FOOD AND GAME THEORY ARE PAST 10M WHY NOT THIS???
I love Pokémon mmmm magikarp looks yummmmmy…
Cravrawler's pokemon card statesthat the meat in crabrawler is little, yet had a tasty and rich flavor
But I’m vegetarian
I mean plants feel pain too so it shouldnt matter make a part 2
Is that a simulated goat
What if we make my personal farming simulator a thing?
POKÉ bowl
They be eating Machamps
This can bee an game theory, no?
So is ditto like something that came out of willy Wonka chocolate factory and can taste like anything
It’s Fletchling Bit fetchling   Also it’s Murkrow Bit Mukrow
Matpat isn’t a teee though
I first thought no there are cows then i thought wait the cows are Pokémon nooo they have to eat pokemon
About mudbray... how much of that weight is edible? Assuming that some of the pokemon have hides that can be quite heavy
Xiangling : *intensive running*
Thank you for drawing the line there😂
also i eat velveta mac and chees
If farmers aren't going to take the time to evolve each pokemon then isn't that the reason why miltank doesn't evolve. Every miltank is just being farmed for milk and is so efficient that no one has ever tried to evolve it.
7:34 Is no one else gonna talk about that this guy showed a picture of a gabite instead of a garchomp?
Vegan gamers are gonna rage
How do you eat carnivine
Hello
mmmmm Raykuaza😋😋😋
well lapras is on a verge of extinction because they are so delicious
What is this, a crossover episode!? :D
*Y* *E* *S*
Thank you. Me and my brothers girlfriend have been questioning if we could make a restaurant using pokémon's.
I can hear the Vegan Teacher coming...
“Pidgey Clones” are called regional birds
Mat, nobody calls you the food theorist. If anything you're the game theorist
I have lore for you
Do they have to eat Pokemon? Cows exist don't they? Ash made a reference to "Cowderpie" in episode 4 (a bit strange 4Kids didn't try to edit out the pun like they usually do but try to salvage the joke).
Bruh i dont like crab i love crab i will eat crab till my death if my mom and dad buy me crab i am going to eat even three
I don't eat pork
Uh don't eat them please demon
What happens to the pokemon after the trainer dies?
Nice garchomp sprite
Why is the thumbnail so funny?! 😂😂🤣
thanks u for ending my childhood dreams of going in pokemon u bch
Owls are carnivores, making hoothoot rather inefficient
I am mad now. People eat goats. Why. (goat favorite animal :D)
can you do a gundanm theoryo :)
Lol the gabite instead of the garchomp
i would like to point out if you go to season 1 of pokemon there are episodes where they talk about pokemon diet like magikarps arent edible cause of their bones
Mass produce ditto, have them transform into Miltanks , bada bing bada boom , easy world hunger solved
Yup, you failed. It garados
Garados. You scar a fish and get a beast that could feed a town.
no🤮🤮🤮🥵🤧🤢😤😡😨😰😥😢😭😱😿😈🤬💔💢💢stop🤒😰😥😢😭👿👿👿😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😵😵💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
What if you ate a legendary Pokémon?
Looks like the pokemon world hate it when people say "Don't play with your food" and did the opposite.
Poor Pokémon and real animals, this is why I’m vegetarian! 💔😞
steaks don't grow on trees uh know 😁🤭😄
l play Pokemon so food three is lieg
Cant go wrong with dog meat
So we officially have Pokemon on all channels
Ahh yes, a perfect video to watch while eating
Why did he say regular civilian and show nurse joy?
*APPLIN IS MY FAVOURITE NOO—*
ChinpokoMen
Fun fact medium slow is faster than medium fast until lv.60+
He put gabite instead of garchomp
You're sick. YOU'RE SICK!
Is it just me who wants to eat Nurse Joy? Yes okay
3:20 Pokémon already has My Pokémon Ranch. Yeah, they’ve done it all
But other than the effectiveness, you must also calculate their edibleness, are they hard to eat, or are they soft enough to chew, are they taste good, or taste like dirt, are they burnable, or they can't be cooked no matter what, etc Hoot hoot have psychic power before even reach evolution stage, and maybe the reason theyre so heavy is their bones, maybe not so much meat, even if not, remember theyre owl with thick feather, maybe they're just a sack of feather without so much meat and mudsdale/mudbray ground type, and they have ground energy not just live in it, maybe they taste like dirt, or even nonedible
Fun fact : Pansage literally give it's hair which is plant that is rooted on it's head, not dead like hair, but living plant that can photosynthesis like another living plant to pokemon that sick or get hurt in anime, and some grass type sometimes give you their ripe leaves for tea and herb
You forget Rolette
7:34 that isn't garchomp its his pre evolved form gabite
make cereal
4:42 the country looks like a goat
Isn’t mudsdale… you know… made of mud
garchomp* shows Gabite
but what about fish? Japan is more famous for fish and sea food, how was it overlooked?
why does gable garchomp?
Mudsdale is like partially mud though I don’t think you would be able to eat the heaviest parts
My theory is that people used to eat mew and thats the reason there is only one mew now
So...not even gonna mention that in the US there's a huge amount of dairy and meat industry lobby, subsidies and how cows are awful for most of the US ecologically? (Bison are much easier on the Prarie grass and the meat is healthier)   There's a few issues with the copy paste approach with using the real world as a base.
The thing is, I wonder how thatveganteacher would react to this.
Thank you. Thank you for ruining my childhood😡😢
I'm fairly certain most of the Pokemon could eat us.
6:57 funny how pikachu got a milk mustache with a straw
Miltank's milk has healing properties
Fun fact: Garchomp is not and does not look exactly like Gabite
7:34 he said garchomp but showed Gabite
0:00 general kenobi?!?!!!!!!??!!!?!?
Mmmm fried torchicken.
The thumbnail has me dead 🤣
😭
Fun fact the majority of animals we eat is because they are slow, easi to catch, or easy to raise. All this is because of our evolutionary advantages
7:34 Thats Gabite, not Garchomp..
Lukaly chinise people dont exist in the pokemon univers iff they did pokemon whod all go extinct in 40 years
well, if i had umbreon or miltank, *I'll eat them, but not literally*
There is a farm in the sun and moon series where miltank are used for dairy produce
My man that’s a Gabite not a garchomp
i think the same reasons why we don't make a habit out of eating uncommon animals could be applied to pokemon: diseases.  the whole current pandemic could be traced to the consumption of such animals.
you mniga
Ukraine is at war with Russia at the moment along with a pandemic but thank God I can find out why I should eat my pokemon.
That Vegan Teacher: Rages
Applin’s are not the apples, they are like dragon worm things that are in the apples, so no they do not grow on trees,maybe you should check your poké facts before you tell us something completely wrong Mr. Matthew Patthew
Ahh yes an perfect titel
the new fire starter might be a rare meat to eat (gen 9) cause its a rare pokemon, also its spicy meat off the bat.
So every Pokémon is edible
sady there are only berries in pokemon world so we need to eat plant pokemon
I agree with everything except for mudbray and mudsdale.  According to its Sword entry mentions; the mud that hardens around its legs sets harder than stone.  Pretty sure what youre going to be eating is...ya know....mud.......because MUDbray and MUDsdale.
7:35 that’s a gabite not a garchomp
Can't wait till Peta starts crawling all over this video 0-0
Me: Noooo charzard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eating a Pokemon is not good don't eat a Pokemon Pokemon are pets
Bugsnax
When Pokemon is sus
I'm wondering what I've done with my life to end up here
What about Magikarp? A super-cheap, readily available and easy to hatch fish would *absolutely* be a staple of diets anywhere near water. What. About MAGIKARP?!
dose he know about pokemon ranch
PETA  would like to know your location.
Let me prove a large part of this wrong. You said that "farmers" wouldn't take there livestock out to battle in order to evolve but then you go on to talk about needed exp to grow Exp is earned through battle and has no effect on pokemon size or produce.If you are going to make a theory try not to prove your own point wrong
Only problem I have with your theory is that you didn't take into account how much milk the Pokemon might produce. Sure, one might hatch and mature faster, but if it takes 10 of them to produce the same amount of milk as one of the others, is it really that efficient?
Even heard of Palworld game in development? This thing has people on two sides. Ether they can't wait for it to come out or there going to about pokemon rip off, slavery, omg you can eat them that sick. If funny became it's nothing new but I guess the art style triggers them
The vegan teacher is coming
Hey I'm vegetarian and I'm allergic to dairy and I eat like 20 hundred handfuls of fruit a day
you missed the ACTUAL FARM in the sun and moon anime. Kiaway (I butchered his name ik) raises bouffalant (I think) and sells miltank milk to normal families
I will eat a hoothoot nugget
Matpat  this is garchomp  Me this is Gabite
Only problem with eating Mudbray is killing the donkey first. If that thing has the stamina ability you'll be there all day!
Is this a food, or film theory 🤔
He showed a gabite when he said garchomp
Eating ass...I mean donkey is not such a bad idea.
i got a pokémon go ad before the video...
There is a pokemon ranch game it was on the wii but i dont remember the name
YouTube Kids :
I'm soya or deiry free
*PETA has joined the chat*
Wailord is also called the Float Whale pokemon. And thus, you now understand why its density to weight ratio means it is effectively lighter than air.
Look I could not help but notice but 12:48 one is not a legendary and one is a ultra beast so yea?
*yum*
Gotta say, the experience growth doesn’t quite make sense. Pokémon don’t grow depending on experience and same with their maturity. Their actual size would be a better category would be better. For example, Miltank does have a slow experience growth, yet it is a Miltank straight out of the egg. Skiddo has to evolve into Gogoat to actually be worth the amount.
Why we dont get our proteins from oysters and crab? bcs they are expensive :) case and point.  edit: he pointed it out right away as well but i wrote 2 fast-
Don’t let Peta see this video
magicarp woud be good
Wailord is so light because it's the "float whale Pokémon", suggesting it's quite boiant
this is just horrifying... lol
Theory O’s should be a thing
😭 I can’t drink milk
I am gonna eat more Seafood…
Wait... I'm like cannibalism?...  Oh god I'm a monster
make a history theory
7:33 one of these things is not like the other
Is it just me or dose standler look super thic on the behind
I honestly feel like tepig a pig pokemon would be the most food source for meat
I’m watching this in-front of my baby chicks..😂😂😂
wait in pokemon journeys ash ate magikarp ramen cannibal or is it actually taste like magikarp or made food theory what about eggxcute its egg right cant you make it scrambled or something?
poision gas pokemon, TIME TO SMOKE
Great video, wanted to point out though that in the pokemon Indigo league season 1 episode 16 after everyone and team rocket are in a shipwreak they all end up on a raft together starving and they all were thinking up a bunch of different ways to cook and eat the magikarp james bought on the boat before it sank. Just didn't see that in the vid and thought it really proved that the humans do eat pokemon
but... what about the taste??? even if the efficiency is high, no one would eat anything tasting terrible. Some pokemon are made of metal, or rock, or ice, or literal clouds!
I kinda think this video should’ve been uploaded in game theory
this was such an intersting video thank you for the amazing content patmat
what is fucking hilarious is that peta made a pokémon game and the story is about humanity trying to eat pokemon.
alwayas rememer kids: M A T P A D  I T S  A L W A Y S  W R O N G
Saw your theory on tap water vs alkaline water, but where does flavored water play into that? Heck even water flavoring like sparkling water or even koolaid. Thought it would be an interesting pt.2
When you get a pokemon nft ad during this vid... don't eat your pokemon, turn them into nfts!
the pokedex for one of the Pokemon in Pokemon sword mentions that the Pokemon's flesh is a delicacy. so yes
Would this be Game or Food theory?
11:40 I call foul, MatPat. Hoothoot, being an owl, would be not only calorically bad in comparison to other fowl... It'd also taste awful. Owls are a raptor bird, a predatory bird that is notorious for tasting awful, meaning that it'd be unlikely for the citizens of the Pokemon world to want to make Hoothoot--and DEFINITELY Noctowl, being a larger, potentially more aggressive predatory bird--into their equivalent to chicken and turkey. Really, I feel this episode isn't "Food Theory"-enough. I believe Matt needs to have a taste test of multiple different bird meats, and theorize on caloric and deliciousness of the meats. After all, just because an animal is quick to produce and heavy in meat doesn't mean it's going to be a staple food for most. I could see Hoothoot being something that you fall back onto when times are rough, just due to the sheer amount of meat, but that it's likely not the most edible for the average family.
applin is the worm not the apple
"We could all end up eating nurse joy"
Milk tank is Abby shapiro
Abigail Shapiro is a milkshake type
I hate you why would you eat your Pokémon
Nintendo is about to strike you.
Now I need a “Muk-krow” Pokémon lol
Magikarp is an actual meal in the Pokemon world they have magikarp with potatos magikarp barbecue Magikarp burger And others
"and garchomp" - shows gabite "are legendaries" - shows metagross
imagine eating a shiny legendary pokemon
The intro is cursed
There is a old story in the sinnoh game sthat says that of you pickthe bones clean of the meat of pokemon andsend down the ocean, theycome back good as new. So maybe you harvest the meat of the pokemon and the meat grows back?
then is nurse joy a cannable if she is a poemon too
I'm almost offended that Gigantamaxed Alcremie isn't on the list.
Here's a question that could be theory worthy, how is it that the number of beef foods are really up, yet cattle aren't considered an endangered species?
There are few theories of people eat pokemon but however,  same goes to animals living in pokemon world as well. Also, its funny because some people have forgotten that people aren't the only ones, same goes with pokemon.  So, pokemon world are like in the real world.
I think magi could be pretty tasty
Ok.
Actually I think Copperajah is much heavier tbh.
I feel like some pokemon are made for eating like would you rather eat an Alcreme or a Lucario...EXACTLY
that real make sanse
The Miltank v Gogoat comparison using growth rate as a determining factor is kind of bad. By growth rate standards Miltank should be the clear winner do to its ability to produce milk much earlier. Miltank gains Milk Drink the milk producing move as early as level 11 while Skiddo doesn't naturally learn it until level 50 and Gogoat even later at 58. At lower levels the growth rates are mostly similar and only start to break off post level 50 which most pokemon will never reach without trainer assistance.
JW Camp Cretaceous: Give the name ‘ Toro ‘ Nintendo: This is not okie dokie
Food theroy part 2 idea team rocket cut off slowpoke tails ILLEGALLY its ILLEGAL in the bulbapidea you can find a page talking about real animles and another that denys it also normal eggs are smaller than pokemon eggs theroy please PLEASE
Can we talk about how MatPat ate a Worm in the start of the video?
correction applin does not grow on trees the apple does but the slug does not
Applin is not the Apple
6:58 that kinda looks sus bro
That’s gabite not garchomp
I just watched my childhood die after 25 years. Great video though lol!
Me acting big-brained like if I understand the science behind this, but not having a clue of what’s going on until the conclusion
booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ah yes, the game theory-film theory-food theory crossover episode
thats not even garchomp you fake fan
5:30 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I would love to live a life where I get most of protein from crabs
All fun and games until someone eats a Zubat.
So fascinating! Makes me wonder what the results would be if we applied it to Zelda animals and monsters.
But they literally have Miltank farms in the games...
00:29 Poorly animated Gameboy Color intro.
I think I have a solid idea how the poke-world could sustain anyone who eats meat
I will eat my pokémon card
Mumei confirmed good to eat
garchomp....
Cmon matpat you put a picture of Gabite for Garchomp
All pokemon lay eggs
dude you should not eat them its not food like zapdos will shock u
Hoothoot would probably most likely be the turkey of the pokemon world.
14:50 No it isn't.
They don't eat very many pokemon, they mostly eat actual animals because there aren't only pokemon. So you would actually eat real beef from a cow and real chicken from a chicken
ahahahhahahahahahhaahaahahahahahahahhaahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaahahahahaahahhaahhaahhahahahahahahhahahhhaahaahaahaahahaahahaahahahhaahhahhahhaahhaahhahahahahahahahahhahahhhahahahhaahahhaahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahaahhahahahahhhahhaahhahaaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
literally recently learned that "Foie gras" isn't a made up something mat made for the video. i'm shocked i never heard of that food before.
As long as nobody eats poison type pokemon (because poison kills), eating most other types of pokemon would be okay.
They need a chicken pokemon
I wonder how many pokemon can be eaten without any taste discomfort.
In future this episode might look sooo different.. For our planet it would be better to not eat animals at all. And it is kind of cheaper too actually.
I love when my veganism conserves my morality across different universes and dimensions! Lol
As a vegetarian... thank you for your consideration 😂
It be dang epic if they took this into the whole take what makes a Pokémon’s powers organs and transplant them into humans like pikachu’s electric pouch cheeks or idk which ever Pokémon body part gives them their powers. 🤔🤣😂
Me watching this after the nurse joy Theory: uh....
Feasting on Lopunny.
I Feel Like Torchic Is A Good Pokemon To Eat Already Blazing And A Chicken
Torchik for chiken
Me : guys can we have a dragonite for dinner  Friends : aww well we ran out of dragonite meat, I mean we can eat a salamence . Ok i don't mind
This is so cursed
This gives me           💀🖤⚫⬛Dark humor⬛⚫🖤💀
Me after seeing this video maybe I should eat my nido king and queen
fried mewtwo forsale for 9999999999999999$ only lol
6:35      Disturbing...
By the way I love Pokemon but I hate how they eat pokémon
Why do people in Pokemon eat Pokemon yeah it's the only meat but it's meat you can eat veggies at a regular diet
When you  ate applin you were eating a dragon along with the Apple
A large portion of Mudsdale's weight is the crazy dense clay on its legs, so a lot of that weight is not meat. Of course the meat it does have would probably be very high quality. The clay could probably be used as a building material, though, so that might be another product for Mudsdale farmers to sell
What about pokomon pescetareans
I would totally play a pokemon farm game
magikarp is thing that the peopl.... npcs eat in gen 1 on the ss anne
What about huntable pokemon
He said them wrong quite a bit.
One of dorky's videos referenced KFC, however Colonel Sanders the guy who owns KFC in both our world and the Pokémon world, KFC in the Pokémon world is known as Kanto fire type chicken. The fast food place sells the spiciest chicken sandwich, how ever the chicken's replacement would be Torchic, whose body's are warm which are warm to hug, but the catch is, their flames are 1800 F. However when someone eats the sandwich, they die in a couple of seconds.
or you could just eat normal food.
Hi
hu, honestly, I thought you were going to go the bug route here. Bug type pokemon hatch, level up and evolve fast. Bugs are full of protein and, above all, a lot of bug pokemon are massive so plenty of meant
Wait that’s a gabite not garchomp
What about Fish Farming with Magikarp?  I really want to know the numbers on that.
POKÉMON  GOTTA EAT EM ALL
Time to eat nurse joy
you ignored the amount of milk that could produced.  a milktank can produce milk -constantly- that is mildly insane.
speaking as a chef, I don't know if I'd wanna eat a Mudbray or a Mudsdale for a few reasons.  1. more often than not animals will taste something like their environment. You see it with catfish (who can taste muddy), and Iberico ham (which taste nutty due to the acorns they eat). Granted that last one is from things they eat, but you get the point. Seeing as how both these pokemon are both ground types chances are they're gonna taste something like that. You don't base all your moves off of something if it doesn't impact you on a molecular level.   2. Even if that wasn't a factor there's still the issue that these are both working animals. These animals would actually be more worth wild as haulers/tillers/riding animals on the farm. You could actually make money just on giving Mudsdale rides to kids or renting them out to construction crews who need a lot of ground moved. Typically when you eat an animal you don't want it to be doing a lot of work. The more work it does the tougher the meat. That's why things such as Veal and Lamb are so prized (and before you mention it, no. it is not common practice anymore to chain these animals to the ground. That went the way of the Foie Gras force feed method). Typically you'd only eat your horse or muel if you had absolutely no other option; otherwise you'd use it strictly as a work pokemon.  Honestly, I think one of the best pokemon you could have as a reusable source of food is Slowpoke. It's tails grow back after a certain period of time so it might be worth it to just have a little pond area where 20 or 30 slowpoke just chill, and you just hack their tails off every now and then. They won't even realize its gone until after you've cleaned the wound and gone back inside, and even then they won't do much about it. I'd also definitely submit Magikarp into consideration since it does have a pretty quick hatch rate, and they won't give you much trouble until they reach level 25 which is hard enough to do with a magikarp when you actually ARE battling it out.   TLDR: Don't eat the fuckin mud horse cause it'll taste like mud and you'll have to cook it for 16hrs before you can start to chew it
Hi                                                                                                       What are you looking at
Eating arceus gonna be god like
yum
I would think fish farming would be economical. Also shelldar would be good. Staryu can regenerate into multiple new staryu.
What about the fish!??? DX My pescatarian self needs to knowwwww
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that a majority of pokemon that are rock, steel, poison, and ghost type cannot be eaten
Time to make some Fried Arceus
Matpat, Matpat, Matpat,  I feel like this missed the mark on genetic compositions of said pokemon. Mudbray and Mudsdale are so heavy because they're ground types and partially composed of earth. Meaning you're going to have some pretty muddy steaks to chose from making it more expensive because it's a labor intensive butchering process. Pokedex entries mention that the mud caked on Mudsdale sets harder than stone, so the equipment alone to process one of them would be tedious. Also, it's not surprising that Wailord is so light considering it's the Float Whale pokemon, and depictions of them in games as wild pokemon showcase them floating along the surface of the water  As for the bird pokemon, Matpat missed the mark by choosing an owl as a livestock pokemon. Owls don't feed on grains and garbage like the other Pidgey clone birds, they eat rodents, in this case most likely Rattata. Now that you're feeding that "efficient" pokemon it's proper diet of other pokemon, the cost of raising it skyrockets. Not to mention that owls are not very meaty, and a majority of Hoothoot's weight is most likely going to be bone and organ. Going for it on weight alone, especially after bringing up the average weight of a chicken and knowing how much even one chicken feeds, was a flop.  Because Matpat based a majority of his final decision on weight, he dropped the ball. Pokedex weights go off of the data colllected from WILD pokemon. Not a pokemon that's been farm raised and fattened for slaughter. Calling back to my first paragraph, Mudbray/Mudsdale is only so heavy because it's made of dirt and rocks, and he'd be better off going for a pokemon more traditionally animalistic that could be fed a diet and maybe even selectively bred for meat and byproduct yields  The biggest thing the video missed was taking into account that different pokemon are native to different regions, meaning export costs have to be taken into account if you are lumping everything as one basic meat. Matpat even mentioned that different livestock is better in different parts of the world, and then completely failed to deliver a conclusion to that point, making instead a one-size-fits all answer. The video would have benefitted from a regional approach that takes into account the real life counterparts of said regions.  Hightailing of of the comment about regions, a good number of those regions are islands, and you can find fishermen in every single pokemon game. Meaning the most likely solution for a catch all meat is a fish, specifically a Magikarp. Carp is a real life edible fish and even in the pokemon anime it's been implied that they're eaten. They're also known as a weak pokemon so they pose less of a threat to someone than I'd say a majority of any other pokemon choice. Mudsdale is that heavy for a reason, and it will not hesitate to trample over a trainer.  In conclusion. Lazy shortcuts were made for the sake of a video that could have been much more interesting and while I know this comment is nowhere near a heavily reviewed script, these are still point that really should have been considered.
My pescatarian self now wants to know the best fish now
-_-
😠
Eh...I mean, sure, Mat intended for this to go with the Nurse Joy episode and have it be about cannibalism, but it doesn't take a genius to make it about something else entirely...
Apple is a worm inside of an apple not an actual apple
Is that mean Vegan only eats grass type pokemon in this world?
most of mudsdale and mudbray's weight is in their hoofs anyway so you can't eat it.
I think picachu would be like fugu
Just wanna quickly mention that not all vegetarians and or vegans dont eat meat just because of not killing animals, some just want to try out the lifestyle or other various reasons
6:32 I’m sorry that moment got me off guard and I laughed so hard
In pokenmon indigo league, an episode  (I forgot the name) said that farfetched, a pokenmon, was getting over hunted because it's a delicious food source. So yes, eat your pokenmon if you're in a desert with no chance of surviving
*I'll hope Pokémon anime shows some Episodes about their sources of Diet like Meat, Fish, Vegetables and the Slaughterhouse*
I don't think you'd want to eat mudbray though... isn't it like, mostly dirt (which is why it's so heavy?)
Excellent😆
Wouldn't this be more of a game theory? Soooo Desperate for CONTENT.  Man your'e all about yourself huh? Could you force yourself down people's throat anymore? Why 3 channels? Why not 10?
This is my new favorite episode across all three channels.
I doubt the ENTIRE POKEMON WORLD eat Mudsdale or get's it's dairy from Skidoo. I mean, not every region has those two pokemon.   Skidoo is confirmed to be the source of all diary in Kalos, but that doesn't mean it's the source of dairy in the world.
hoot hoot also litterly looks like a giant chicken leg
I thought he was going to say "and I take a bite."
6:34 AYO😳
Hey mat Pat I no that you already made a   Cannibal video but what about cinnamon tost crunch
starly and fletchling arent pidgey clones, they are viable pokemon that you can use throughout the entire game
7:32 they put a picture of Gabite instead of garchomp lol
"and the pre-evolved forms of rare pokemon like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp" BUT THAT'S A PICTURE OF A GABITE
hoothoot is heavy, I, a real person weigh 50kg
Matpat: by a regular person also matpat: shows picture of nurse joy also also matpat: says earlier to watch his video called nurse joy is a Pokémon. Me: lol
12:48 the only pokemon that out weigh mudslade are legendarys also editor adds mege metagross
Wouldn’t magikarp be really good considering it’s faster to grow and u can get a lot
He called it garchamp and showed Gabite
I mostly eat fish and shrimp
R we talking about pokemons or farms
for the raising stuff, i would just go to galar and get as much exp. candys and feed them to all the fram pokemon
I hate it
Piedov
Garchomp 🤣🤣🤣
And if you look at kiawes family farm he has over 82 mudbray as said by rotom in the episode kiawe has a little farm
I believe we will see militank burgers one day, doesn’t matter in how many years but it will happen
Actually that you’re going through all the food theories for the Pokémon what about like a pescatarian kind of food like the best kind of octopus or shrimp or lobster or even just fish
Eat your Pokémon?
Make Life Theory
What about milkery
poke theory red, green and yellow where blue at?
7:25 warm body reduces that time though
huh i feel like intro would be in some weird pokemon fangame
Apparently applin is a worm inside the apple, not the apple itself
I love how deep this is
mMmmMm mM tasty dragon 0:22
7:34 that my dude is not a *Garchomp* 12:49 and metagross is not a legendary!😂😂
also in the opening sequence there was something you got wrong applin is not the apple so if the apple is destroyed he is still fine
The donkey/horse pokemon probably weigh so much because they are rock pokemon which probably means they wouldn't be great for consumption.
Surely Miltank still produces milk in greater volumes than the goat
Finally i can eat miltank
Well, you ruined my sister's childhood. Welp. ☹️
3:00 I s that ark?
Pokemon are not food at all it's just like eating a human so don't eat Pokemon. 🚫🫕
There is a massive point this video overlooks when it comes to optimal livestock: animal behavior and physiology, and the mutually beneficial nature of domestication.  Throughout our history, humans have hunted, fished, and trapped a huge variety of animals. But you ever wonder why we haven't domesticated *all* the prey we've sought out?  Quite simply, some animals are just not suited for human civilization.   Take deer in North America – they're a fantastic food source (ruminates in general are great, since convert all that inedible grass into meat and milk), and their herd behavior means they're fine being kept in some numbers. However, they are INCREDIBLY agile, migrating animals. Up until recently, catching and containing them would have been impossible. Even then, convincing them to breed and raise young in captivity can be tricky.  Cows, sheep, and goats? They like to stay put, and they aren't quite as athletically inclined. Goats do climb, though they are small enough that keeping their climbing contained isn't too difficult. They also do great with large herds and close quarters, as huddling together was already part of their survival strategy pre-domestication.  Even when it comes to companion animals, there's a massive difference between a domesticated vs. tamed pet. Besides generations of selective breeding required for domestication, some animals will take much differently to it.  Dogs are ideal animal companions to humans due to similar social structures and diets. Similarly, cats thrive in our care due to their dual predator-prey nature – we keep away bigger predators while offering an easy food with the pests we attract. The now-feral pigeons you see in major cities are the result of escaped or released domestic birds thriving so well in human society, they just stuck around.  Finally, it's important to note that carnivores are generally bad food sources, while omnivores can be dicey. Predatory animals offer boast a higher caloric density over prey animals, but also greater risk – both because they've concentrated things like parasites, heavy metals, etc. from the rest of the food chain. This is why eating predatory fish is generally something that needs to be limited, as they have incredibly high concentrations of mercury. Simultaneously, carnivores cannot often be kept together in great numbers. A fair amount of predators are also solitary. It's not uncommon to see aggression and/or cannibalism when kept together.  All of this is to say: just consider the feats some of these Pokemon are capable of. Magikarp might *seem* like an easy source of protein, but what happens when Friday's fish fry becomes Saturday's localized monsoon because part of the swarm evolved? How much effort would it take to slaughter a *giant, flying psychic bird of prey* like Noctowl on an industrial scale? What processing, tools, and funding is necessary for things like Fire-type Pokemon to be safe for handling?  All-in-all, I think this comes down to three points that make a truly ideal Pokemon livestock: 1. Pokemon that like to group together and breed easily, 2. Pokemon with low base stats and few-to-no evolutions, and  3. Pokemon with gentle temperaments. It is for this reasons that I propose that just like in many parts of the real world, Bug-type Pokemon are a massive food source for a lot of people. Paras and Parasect seem like a potentially popular option, as they're abundant and become more docile upon evolution. Humans are fond of both cordyceps mushrooms and arthropods like shrimp, too, so two food sources in one. As for industrial-scale farming: Luvdisc, Wobbuffet, Chansey line, and the Jigglypuff line are probably the best livestock Pokemon. Seriously. Fish farming is a huge industry, and Luvdisc is one of the weakest, most easily caught Pokemon. Seems easy to maintain on a farm. Wobbuffet takes ages to level up, but evolves from Wynaut at a relatively early Level 15. They're also just... really dumb, but incredibly hardy. Definitely something you want for livestock.  Chansey *also* produces eggs that are apparently edible on the spot, and is a very sociable Pokemon. I imagine it would mostly be an egg layer, but they're HUGE Pokemon. Lots of meat for the work of chipping through that HP. Jigglypuff is a concern with Sing, but that's easy to counteract with earplugs, and doubles as an incredible fur/leather producer with super soft fur and extra flexible skin.  And that's my theory.

Isn’t pikachu.exe about how people in the pokemon world eat
If I were in the Pokémon world I would be vegan
This was some of pokemon im gonna eat or drink Krabby and kingler,i like eating crab stick, Miltank i like milk but im not gonna drink like almost everything for some reason, Shuckle im gonna use by feeding it with stawberry blueberry or other type of berry to make juice, Vanilish just remove the soul and ice shards,dunk it in chocolate or strawberry cream and you make extra cold ice cream
what about fish? oh whait that will just be Magikarp  or what about insects? edible bugs are getting more and more popular these days
What Pokemon can be eaten by civilians  Shows nurse Joy i said what i said
Hoot hoot is just one big chicken leg
Lol you used the PokémonCaféMix title
7:35 Sorry to say, but....   thats a gabite. twt
That is a gabite
I do eat dog and I will eat Pikachu
7:35 Not a Garchomp Matpat not a Garch
gotta eat them all😋🤭😄
😎 intro
Awesome video as usual, I think evolution should have been taken into consideration though. A lot of Pokemon have huge exponential growth in height and weight after evolution which would provide greater yield. I think it would make sense in this universe to slaughter directly after evolution if possible.
chanys give it eggs to people and pokemon
Vegetarians on this video be like : *cricket noises*
Fun Fact : Some pokemon such as Krabby are eaten.
Why you shouldn't eat pokémon? Have you ever seen a normal animal in the game or the anime?

Kiawe has mudbray on his family farm
Could you please PLEASE bake a salt cake? In master chef season 5 ep 18, Leslie supposedly baked a salt cake that cost him the round and his chance to win. How ever it is a hotly debated decision bc not only did the show not show such incident (like they would normally do) , but the judges didn’t spit it out or anything. The behavior of everyone was off . Even Leslie, when he had to admit it. So maybe it was a hoax created by the show. So my challenge to you is to bake a salt cake and test the viewers’ theory . As explained in the links below, can a salt cake even look soft and fluffy. Would it be edible at all? Would the chemistry is a salt cake be different from its sugar counter part? So you have the visual test, the stability test (can it hold, what about crumbs, etc) , and you have the the actual cooking/ baking. As in could you actually accidentally do that. Would a season chef/ baker like Leslie make that mistake  or would he know something was off from the beginning (like in knives out , when the nurse knew she picked up the right vial bc of the weight ).  Chemistry vs television. Is it possible ? Who is right? I think it would make a great ep and I would love to know the answer ! Below in the link , it’s suggested that even using salted vs unsalted butter or an extra 1/4 tsp of salt would have made a notable difference in baking. Something so small. Is that true, if so how could a whole cup and a half go unnoticed. Questions questions qu3tions and you might give us all an answer. 😁 interested…?  https://www.reddit.com/r/Masterchef/comments/rn4ibl/leslie_from_masterchef_reveals_the_truth_about/  https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/rn0qgj/leslie_from_masterchef_reveals_the_truth_about/
He lost me at eating Mudbray. I love my cute Mudbray😩
So Brock was correct trying to eat nurse Joy
Wait there is a food theory?
“Nurse Joy Is A Pokemon!”  “Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon!”   Mhm.
that vegan teacher watching this🤣
hmmmmmm where does steak from pokemon come from? an animal? or a pokemon? hmmmmmm?
before I watch the video that they are normal animal in the episode where ash encounter caterpee we see the pideot eating normal worms then turn it atention to caterpee and in the newst movie (i forgot the name) bird pokemon was eating a normal fish then pikachu  went in it mouth
Dude, HootHoot weighs more at birth than I weigh in like 8 YEARS... I'm sad now
7:35 “Garchomp” That sure looks like a garchomp to me.
Should this be in food theory, or game theory?
12:44 wtf that's nonsense the pokemon company really stopped caring at all (The games are the good/optimal reality and the Pokedex entries are simply from various realistic/horrible shouldn't exist realities)
I did the math an I think one mudbray can support a family of four for 3.27 months
Ayo😳
7:34 that is gabite not garchomp
I would like a fried Corvikight
7:34 that's gabite, not garchomp
I’m  out
In the Pokemon world, they could get more proteins from seafood.  1. The population in this world is much smaller - when the population in our world was smaller and the waters could produce about the same amount of seafood, if not more, it was actually pretty cheap, especially fish was considered food for the poor. 2. The sea pokemon are in some cases much larger than their RL counterparts. Krabbies for example are huge compared to RL, resulting in possibly higher global yields for less work in porocessing and logistics. Plus, they can be bred easily compared to IRL.
How is fish not a major source of protein
I'd eat nurse joy if you know what i mean
Moomoo milk, wonderful
“Fetchling” Matt I will never forgive you I woke up from my nap Bc of how awful that was 😂
And film theories
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Don't forget about the berries
It's typically cheaper to eat local sources of food, so Pokemon from two different regions wouldn't likely be the main food source. Maybe Alolans would eat Mudsdale, but that's a small island region and Mudsdale doesn't live in many other regions so far, so imports on the meat would make it expensive. It would make more sense to look at this by region.
What if we eat people like you-? How will it taste lol
I do have to say that lamb looks very yummy I’ve never had lamb before though
Congratulations you will be the first sticker I am making today
If people leave Pokémon what do Pokémon eat ?
I don't eat pork
I like how nobody is talking about him showing gabite while saying garchomp
Wait a minute nurse joy is a Pokémon and I should eat my Pokémon??🤤
HOW AM I GOING TO EAT TYRANTRUM
Just saying thats a gibble not a Garchomp
I love this
Next episode of pokemon theory. yes, you shold eat you trainer.
That is poke Killing abuse
Dear MatPat, wooper is covered in a posionus film so trying to munch on it would be fatel even though its the shape of a mushroom
What about fish?
"A single rotisserie Hoothoot will feed your entire family for a week."  Even discounting the equines as potentially only weighing that much due to inedible earthen biology, the hoothoot seems like it needs to factor into the cost side of the 'pokemon trainer profits' equation. Because if something takes roughly the same effort to raise as chickens for multiple times the meat, basic economics says that the resulting meat should be cheaper at market.  Given that pokemon also lower the manpower requirements for a lot of quality of life matters, I think this would tilt pokemon training solidly into 'reasonable' paycheck range, especially if, like gym members, you specialize in one type of pokemon that may very well have tradework value.  Incidentally, this video also accidentally answers many of the questions surrounding the existence of the 'human-like' egg group.  With the genetic similarities presented in the "humans are pokemon" video and the Joy connection, it seems obvious that the ones that are closest to humans are classified that way in part to remove them as food options under a wider umbrella of cannibalism.  After all, if there's breeding viability, many people count it as the same species on that alone. Not that that makes a lot of sense with egg groups or omnibreeders in the mix.
So we were told we can eat pokemon  Then i was thinking How would you eat a wailord he literally a whale he will eat you before you can bite him even
They eat Berrys and mumu milk and more
Best pokemon cafe mix item *YUMMY YAMPER PASTA*
yes magickarp ect yes but for your own pokemon why eat them breed them insert lenny face
Wait if Nurse Joy is a Pokémon can we eat her?
In a pokemon episode where ash catches Pidgeotto... We can see the Pidgeotto eating a non pokemon earthworm thing... Which makes me wonder if pokemon coexist with real world animals.. (Although we were never shown about it... I'm not sure it's just a thought likely to be untrue)
“Pokémon can be eaten” …. “Nurse joy is a Pokémon “
not sure the importance of exp growth as it is unrelated to the physical growth of the pokemon, miltank hatches able to make milk (odd considering youd expect it would have to get pregnant first but kangaskahn hatches with a baby in its pouch...so...)
7.35 That's a gabite, sorry, I had to
Man at one point I forgot this was a Pokémon video
I love how he used Petscop's opening as his Intro here. The whole joke about Petscop just being a lame rip-off of the Pokémon franchise.
What if  Well you Where eating  a magiccarp and it ewaves to a gardos
Taste and nutrient content are a big factor, but I imagine that data is limited.
7:34 sir thats a gabit not garchomp
what about fish?
Man now I'm craving charizard
What is pokemon are related to animals in some way
Where do they get their fish from?
now you know why he caught 30 tauros
Any meat in pokemon is pokemon meat and what jf the only editable foods are the cute ones
What if you eat a fire type Pokemon would it be pre-cooked?
Anyone notice that the garchomp he showed was actually a gabite
That far home was not a garchomp it was a gabite
at least the actual applin didnt get hurt or did u eat the dragon slug too
Im going to be horrible but did you just use gabite for garchomp?
conto 2:10
well lets list the types that you wouldn't eat steel, poison, rock, ground, ghost, electric, and fire i guess the others types are fair game and it would be cool to eat like a dragon steak or something
Why is this so intriguing, I’ve watched this vid 5 times and still enjoy coming back to it
Why did you put a gabite Whalen you said garchomp
Was it nice
anything is edible if you try hard enough
3:40 Magikarp is not consumable
I thought he was going to look at the regional diets, after all there are parts of the world where say seafood is a bigger source of protein than read meat and poultry. Also soem area may not have cows goat or chicken widely available in their area but another local animal good for herding
As a proud omnivore, I'd still be interested in which Pokemon I'm getting my greens from.   Although I am interested in that turtle very smoothie. 😋
I find it funny that MatPat has made no theories on Pokemon Unite, but shows a random picture from the game in the video
Why don't fisherman just catch magikarps and then just evolve them to sell powerful pokemons in the auction
also something not considered cause it’s not very common in the western world, but two billion people in the world eat insects regularly, I’d be curious to know how bug pokemon factor in especially due to their large size. I’d imagine due to most pokemon regions being island, fish and bugs would be much more common meals. Especially considering that weight of an bugs would in theory not have bones, and thus a blipbug being 17lbs, non poisonous, quick egg cycle, medium fast growth,  probably a decent choice. (Venonat alone is 66lbs, although poisonous, so would need special preparation) I imagine logistically the Pokémon world would be much more interested in bugs as livestock, especially in what it would cost to take care of them.
there are no  cows in pokemon so of course they eat pokemon
matpat: you should eat your pokemon me: try saying that to my army of legendary pokemon i keep in my pc
How about the daycare. You can just walk then it evolves
Why does ash looks so happy in the thumbnail
don't eat applin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pikacu
Imagine you have a apple and it is crunchy then you see it has eyes
End up 'eating' Nurse Joy? So did he, or did he not think that through? HmmmmMMMmmm?
Playing pkmn crystal clear right now lol
Not related to this video, but what is The Bottom Right section of the logo? Life Theory? Earth Theory? Miscellaneous Theory?
That is what I did with all of my catches on Pokemon Go. Just turned them into candy. Why? Why not?
ehehehehehehe
matpat: nurse joy is a pokemon also matpat: 3:12 which pokemon is mostly likely to be eaten by a regular civilian? *𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝗻𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗷𝗼𝘆*
nooooo i am not eating my evee
4:32 so beef is an animal now?
why did he say garchomp and show a picture of gabite
NOO THE SHUCKLE!!! THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!!!! >:(
i could use some exeggcute right now
In this vid he sounds like a farmer
Another dairy and edible pokemon is alcremie. Because it is literally the whipped cream pokemon!
I culd never eat my mewtwo Anyway,  they culd be' vehetarian. I see some fruit like the berry that are uge and plus there is things like rice,  chees
anybody remember ash eating a magikarp?
Lamb meat doesnt mean baby sheep just refers to the meat.   Not all farmers raise cows to full size. At a certain age their growth rate slows while feed increases  If everyone grew/raise only one type the others would raise in value.
Not to mention the fact that most food in the universe is processed or berries. Appleton is a fruit, so you'd think that people would eat them, being one of the only fruits NOT meant for Pokémon to eat. Stuff like the chips in Pewter City are usually eaten by humans, but in Let's Go Eevee, your Pokémon can eat them(this may be applicable to Let's Go Pikachu or other games, I can't be sure). So most non-pokébased foods are junk food mainly found in the stores in each city. Let's just be sure that Pringles doesn't did up a Dugtrio instead of a potato!
Cant eat nurse joy. Brock has been trying for decades
I think calculating growth rate into this equation is meaningless. It only matters when you would first start the farm but after a couple years it should reach a constant rate of one batch growing and one batch being killed off so idk bout putting that into calculations....
I'm pretty sure that ash -killed- took a flabébé's life in pokemon sun and moon when he's left alone to make his own meal
Lorelei
I only know of one pokemon that's truly only useful as food in it's base form.  Magicarp.
Just imagine if your waiter walks up to you and asks if you want a Pikachu steak or froakie legs
Sobble is a onion.
That's a thicc donkey
now should this be in food theory cuz eating em or film theory cuz pokemon is a franchise of a show also i think its like crawdaunt or smth its pokedex at one poin says people eat it
Nurse joy is a Pokémon. So does that mean that you should eat Nurse Joy!!??!??
0:45 4th wall problem
When Mat says Skidoo instead of Skiddo.
Thank you so much! My childhood self is so happy lol people look at a kid crazy when they ask if people eat Pokémon 🤣🤣🤣😭
..Another (more complex) thing, though. As MatPat said, certain foods are more common per area. Sure, overall, but different regions have different Pokemon and I know sure as heck Hoothoot ain't in Kanto, so what they be eating? They shipping it? Maybe. It's interesting to think about, though it would make for a tiresome video.
Delicious rock-meat mudbray
Pokemon as food?!  Give me a Magnemite, Gastly, and Muk please!   Maybe a Voltorb for desert, give an Onix to a starving family...
When matpat eats a literal worm:WTH
pokémon
There is evidence that Pikachu is a FEMALE
"Children *USED TO* eat them as snacks"  There's a theory behind that choice of words... I can feel it :D
Hypno
I am going to look through a whole stack and name edible pokemon in it
In the recommended of this video is ( nurse joy is a pokemon )  What you saying matpat .
Why do you show gabite for garchomp
7:35... that was a Gabite not a Garchomp
Huh now i wonder after rewatch this, if in game theory's nurse joy episode says pokemon and human are the same, and then nowadays human eat pokemon, is that cannibalism?   🤔🤔🤔
I would comment about the video, but the “Theory O’s” in the beginning caught me off guard  *IT’S GENIUS OKAY*
Well so you can take dna cells of cows and grow them for food so practically this is fake
Everyone ignoring that Mudbray probably tastes like dirt lmao.
I shouldn't have watched this because I am a pokemon fan
When he said ‘tastes like mudbray’ I laughed so hard
1 thing on the final summary: This entirely ignores the possibility of selective breeding. This is like comparing wild game to farmed animals, which can defo change how things look. (Remember, the games focus on wild-caught cockfighting animals. Not farm simulator)  Often times the animals we hunt, and the animals we domesticate don't always line up. Not many people hunt wild boar or cattle, yet pork and beef are staples of many cuisines.   So it may be entirely possible that some other form of domesticated bird pokemon is more common in grocery stores, where hoothoot are a common aim for hunters  Sidenote: Chancy may also be a big egg producer in the world. Though all Pokemon produce eggs, Chancy do so without any breeding required, and do so fairly rapidly. They may also have been fairly easy to domesticate given how friendly they naturally are
Wow this is very educational
As I watch this I’m eating some meat
Did you just wake up and think: hey I wanna eat Pokémon
good video.. you always put in lots of work to these shall we say creative topics lol. but you completely ignored domesticatability... the other reason we don't eat ostriches on a massive scale lol
There is one glaring curiousity about this theory: What About The Seafood Options?!
My Flareon is holographic and he's gonna be worth a lot one day. I can't eat him. He's gonna get bring in the cash in 2076
hey can magicard produce caviar?
Im here after watching that Facebook video where Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle being prepared as exotic dish. The video was so friendly yet still graphical and heartbreaking to watch 😅
This fits into all 3 categories
I feel like tapu lele will taste like a starwberry
Ahoyhoy There, Fellow YouTuberinos! I think HO-Oh would be the tastiest, he is like a huge Farfetch'd
Could you feed a blaziken fried chicken and call it cannibalism?
I'm a rancher that does both cows and goats and they both are profitable where I live
You didn't even touch on Pokemon Go. You literally grind up Pokemon for candy to help other Pokemon of the same species get stronger. Pokemon cannibalism was not enough of an interesting topic?
Torchic: am I a joke to you
.. i can only think of vanillish
No dont eat them
Matpat: Which Pokemon would a regular CITIZEN eat?  Also Matpat: Includes a picture of nurse joy even though making a theory about how nurse joy is a Pokemon.
Hey i would have a Pikachu cake to eat rather the real Pikachu itself.
Miltank is the best milk and meat source, they’re born at full maturity and need no growing to produce meat and dairy. Also they can immediately reproduce after hatching
Huh, I thought it would only be common in the older generations of pokemon that they'd mention people eating pokemon. I'm glad they've kept up the tradition through the decades!
Wait… so you’re suggesting that it would be perfectly okay to eat any and all Pokémon, even those who clearly show human level or above intelligence, can speak freely or use telepathy (such as Lucario) and process every bit the same level or above of understanding, emotion, and thinking ability as the humans? How does not NOT feel wrong to EVERYONE leaving comments here?
Can I just say that milktank milk is a common item in the games, that implies that milktanks ARE commonly used to get milk
7:34 is this a joke or did he put a Gabite on screen
Well farfetch does come with a leek 🤣😭
10:38 we eat chickens because ostriches are feathery murder birds
11:04 i am not a pidgey clone >:(  (okay so what if i am, im still cuter 😤)
Wait till he figures out that he could have just gotten most of the data from Pokémon go like they’re height and weight
3:51
:/
9:25 I feel like farmers would use EXP Candies or Rare Candies to get their farm Pokémon to evolve instead of battling
This is my kindom come 6:34
5:30 nice.
7:34 that’s Gabite not Garchomp
never no no NO NO NO!
I would eat nurse Joy then
Did any body noise the fnf bob
fun fact the apple on applin isnt part of it its a actual apple
0:49 You gave me ideas...
Matpat: Dragonite, Tyrannitar & Garchomp *Shows Gabite*.
After playing Brilliant Diamond, I discovered for a fact that, yes Pokemon are used as food in the world.
0:15 Chancey eggs or other eggs and cheese milk peanut butters butter
Seafood?
Fish?
XD ho-oh not is an legend???
wait,i like axolotls and waiit their can exist wooper broth like axolotl broth
I love the fact that this video straight points out that it's more efficient to eat plants (yes you can get the protein you need from plants) then animals.
Ah yes. Exactly how I remember garchomp, looking like a Gabite instead x3
Just imagine a realistic Pokemon world where people farted Koffings.
Is it ethical to eat something you can probably f**k!!!!
Yeah matpat did you know that that isn't just a ordinary Pokemon right next to you that is a Pokemon but to us to me it is actually a needle need a rands I actually have a bunch of Pokemon plushies so I love Pokemon please change is not destroy my childhood like cos I am a kid so yeah please don't destroyer I love watching your videos and all but it's mostly about movies I don't watch I mean I love your videos so much and if I ever get my hands on our I'll get your Merch just saying but anyway from your biggest fan savannah 😘
But wait... Since humans and Pokémon share the same ancestors... Wouldn't eating them just be twice removed canabalism?
I'm guessing Skiddo are less popular as dairy cattle than Miltank on account of how much milk is produced. Suppose a fully grown Miltank produces 3 litres of milk a day, and a fully grown Skiddo produces 0,3 litres per day. That would probably weigh heavily toward Miltank still being the most cost effective choice for dairy.
Now, we should consider that Mudsdale and Mudbray have a significantly deceptive weight. Their feet are covered in mud as hard as stone, the tail too for Mudsdale. This means that a good portion of that weight isn't actually going to be edible at all, unless you're a fan of eating chunky dirt.
Cant they eat corn?
Nurse Joy cake
The icon is really sad
Can you tell what are those food eat by Pokémon ? Those pelet like things
His Garchomp was a Gabite though...
wait a mon so u could eat pokemon now thats allowed ok YESSSS I AM GONE EAT alcermie THATS FOR SURE I HAVE BEEN DIEING TO EAT ONE
I would hate to live in the Pokemon World.
MatPat: “…that’s why we eat chickens and not ostriches.” Me: Also ostriches would mess you up if you even tried to eat it
I imagine magikarp is probably most effective seafood given the size vs evolution level
It's funny that mat does example of culture using different meat based on which is more valuable land or labor because it's the same reasoning for when people did dowry or bride price. If land was more valuable wife's family would provide land to help compensate the cost of supporting the wife and if labor was more valuable husband would pay wife's family to compensate the reduction in labor.
Fun fact I will starve in the pokemon workd since I am Muslim I can't eat hoothoot owl meat or Mudbrey horse meat
people saying you shouldnt eat pokemon cause its wrong is like saying you shouldnt eat meat of any kind cause its wrong
Do a theory about the Vegan Teacher
your making me wonder if magmar tastes like burning lava or hot spicy stuff and the same with pikachu wether he tastes like lightning or electric my entire body
Game theory : nurse joy is a Pokémon Food theory: 3:15 sooo joy eats other Pokémons now? 😂
Am I the only one who remembered the fact milcery existed 🤨
10:13 bro, just get a rendomizer.
man eats literal dragon
At 7:33 he says “Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp” but then shows a picture of Gabite instead of Garchomp
I wonder which part of nurse joy is more yummier?🤤
So what is going to be the 4th theory channel? I would be into Music Theory.. Book Theory is nice too but i don't read that many books anymore. Or Myth Theory?  Also. Since it is said that Pokemon were People at some point... doesn't make everyone in Pokemon cannibals? Farfetched? Mh.. probably.
i wanna eat klefki
Okay that's a lie me and my family eats chicken in seonds
think im mean
wait nurse joy is a pokemon i thing right so we can eat nurse joy
ME LOVE 00000.0000 ME HATE 100000000000000000000000000000000000.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
UR ARE A BAD HUMAN
WHY POKEMON W T F MAN
I think something really important to consider that's kind of ignored here is that, more likely than not, Hoothoot is a carnivore. 10 pounds of berries make a pound of Rattata, 10 pounds of rattata make a pound of Hoothoot. Unless an animal is eating mostly stuff that humans aren't, like grass, scraps, or slop, it's almost never really worth the investment as a meal.
*COFFIEEE* Koffing, the Poison Gas Pokémon.
What about regional differences? I know that would've been too much to take in to account for a single video but it'd still be an interesting topic
Mudbray and Mudsdale probably taste like dirt sadly... I think they'd be the worst to eat, the pokemon type would affect flavor if it has such an affect on their weight
Oh sure matpat, make me eat a ROSE THAT'S A POISON TYPE not today matpat you can't make me eat my favorite Pokemon aka roserade
I'm just saying, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPW0S5sNMK4
I do not like this 👎👎👎👎👎
CALL THE HUMANE SOCIETY AND PETA!!
somehow I doubt owls can be farmed like chickens
0.54 depending on the person that may or may not sound depressing
I think in the pokemon entry onyx can evolve into steelix by pressure underground. I think it is also possible to evolve pokemon in natural ways other than fighting.   I think the farmers growing their livestocks from eggs are doing cardio everyday ahahahhaahh
I looooooove the game boy animation for the Game theory
NO...
Magikarp
what about fish pokemons mat pat? is magicarp best fish meat source?
But.... Aren't some pokemon sentient? Isn't that kinda canibilisim?
Food theory: Yes, you SHOULD Eat your Pokemon! Game theory: Nurse joy is a POKEMON! **breaths in**
No one gonna mention the fact that when he said Garchomp, they put a picture of Gabite there?
13% you say?
My tummy is hungry
I would eat Nurse Joy
Oh, farmers are definitely out there battling their Pokemon in order to evolve them.  So yes, Gogoat and Mudsdale count.  Only issue is both of them are very region exclusive.
Gotta say, I'm disappointed in this episode. You didn't seem to put any effort into determining how much of any particular pokemon's body weight would be made up of edible meat.  Hoothoot may be a heckin chunk, but it's also like 50% eyeball.  And Mudbrey is a ground type. It lives in mud. It eats mud. So how much of that bodyweight is due to it being caked with dirt both inside and out?  You were talking about caloric conversion. What's the caloric conversion ratio when the animal's diet is literally dirt?
Eating Nurse Joy huh? I wonder how? Hehehe.
I hate you for saying this
Applin is the worm inside of the apple btw
imagine vegan teacher looking at this XD
MatPat, please do a video about the environmental sustainability of switching to insect protien. I want to hear the breakdown of raising something like mealworms or crickets for protein powders. Also, rabbit is a very sustainable source of red meat but makes up such a small percentage of global intake, why is that?  You rock! :)
3:54 he wrote use 2 two times
Well the thing is mudbray and mudsdale are that heavy cause mud
The awesome collab want pokemon because im playing pokemon unite a
The photo of the video Is realy creepy Ash eating His picachu with hapines Is vreepy
A lot of Pokemon heights and weights don't seem to make a lot of senet
Your eating a wyrm if your eating applin btw.
Ah yes now I know how to start a farming business
Not sure if anyone noticed the "Garchomp" was actually a Gabite.
My dad calls “transferring Pokémon” in Pokémon go “The meat grinder” because how else would you get the candy? 😂
Me when i first saw this: noooooo
Since real fish also exist in the pokemon universe I would think that would be the best animal protein choice.
??????? Aplin is not an apple but it's a little warm inside
Congrats, in the first 2 minutes of the video you made the end of Unraveled obsolete.
"Most people only eat about 1/3 pound of crab" Me a Marylander about to end this man's whole career
I’ve never thought about eating owl but if I ever had the opportunity I’m trying it
It's funny how the question specified a Kanto or Johto resident, but gogoat, and mudbray are both Kalos pokemon. *Not a critique by the way, just thought it was funny*
das a gabite my boi, not a garchomp
What the actual heck
this one made me sad
so my little darling pets are safe!unles we talk about eggs. you didn't cover that, as wich pokémon breed the fastest in order to produce a lot of eggs. i know for a fact that my favorite pokémon, eevee, are pretty fast at getting along to clone themselves.
Applin isn’t the apple it’s the worm in the apple
Monsanto rare candies to help level Pokémon to be raised quickly and efficiently just watch for those gmo’s 😂 Maybe take level growth out of the overall calculations. A few real in game reasons are rare candies and lucky egg and exp share. It wouldn’t be as difficult to get that working in universe to effectively counter act some of those other factors. Also that isn’t taking antibiotics or anything of that nature into account. Tauros pidgey and miltank personally I think would be best if we only take kanto into account. Also breeding  It’s done in game but Pokémon size are not standard either and much like real animals you can breed them to be bigger.
Wait do vegans in the Pokémon world just eat grass type Pokémon!!!!
Game theory is a sister?
The fact he said garchomp and showed gabite is both triggering and hilarious
What do you mean eating Pokemon!!
Finaly a good idea
I sense N's disapproval and misery with this topic
Maybe bulbasau r is yummy...saying yummy to a pokemon is uncomfortable
Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a pokemon. Food Theory: You can eat your pokemon. Me: I don't like where this is going.  R34: I like where this is going. Me: (Grab a shotgun.) Oh no you don't!
The vegan teacher would be so mad about this video
Oh boy can't wait to take a bite into of my turtonator soup
7:38 ah yes Garchomp...*shows a picture of Gabite*
5:19
No not 5:20 it’s…
5:20 “broilers
Hi
ooohhh so that's why i saw a homeless person eating a pikachu figure last week
Don't eat your pokémon, it's bad
I’ve ate mine already.
Oh boy can't wait for the comments to be telling at MatPat for saying Garchomp but uses a image of Gibite. Have fun with that.
i find it weird this theory actually goes into the growth rate when that's abou exp, which is about leveling, only to talk about not evolving pokemon. Like the only reason to gain exp is to evolve them
matpat is mythpat haaa
Wow these video. is  randomly  long
Wait if it's true how Rowlet tastes like?
I wonder why the growth rate would matter with Pokemon in this topic. After all, Miltank from the egg is already fully grown, so why take the effort to level them up? I get it if you're trying to evolve them if there was a reason. But, it'd be less efficient to have them fight just to slaughter when you can a fully ready Pokemon at the start. My thought is that experience growth refers to the growth of their combat ability. Some Pokemon are just quicker to reach their potential. Idk just seemed strange to me.
Just to let you know you have to be in Korea for it to be legal to eat whale
wait- i dont- i dont drink milk-  i drink almond milk
Look at all those hoothoots
Matpat, please don’t start a bill cooper style conspiracy channel, because I’m pretty sure you’d have to get really intimate with your assigned nsa agent.
Horse meat would be so tough to eat.
Doesn't that mean that you can eat nurse joy?
Now Food Theory is next on Thatveganteachers hit list
Imagine that vegan teacher watching this
Meanwhile they’re organs:      AHHHHH————
Imagine if the vegan teacher saw this-
One major flaw in the logic here is that Pokémon don’t necessarily die even if you take off all their meat and eat it. One of the texts in the library in Gen 4 D/P tells a story of eating a fish Pokémon down to the skeleton, then releasing the skeleton back into the water where it heals completely. Basically you could harvest every bit of meat from one Pokémon, and it could still heal to provide a second harvest, and a third, and a fourth and so on. This means even Pokémon who arnt the MOST efficient for breading can be better than ones that are if you can harvest a lot more from them.
Piplup
Applin is not the apple it is the worm
Ok
Would people really eat mudbray, I mean, it’s probably gonna taste bad cuz it’s mud
pure protein
This is nice and horrifying
After 2020, the average beef steak is now $60. The average chicken parts, $40. WITH TAX. (United States).
The best pokémon for producing milk is Nurse Joy or Milktank? Torchic is probably good for Eggs in varied climates from snow to desert.
That was a Gabite. Not a Garchomp.
Did you know that applin is a worm in the apple
Kraft dinner said that they are now more cheesy and have a box of 50 percent more Kraft dinner THIS HAS TO BE A FOOD THEORY
*The Vegan Teacher disliked this video*
I just realized T-T the "jelly filled donut" aka an onigiri is filled with tuna
If HootHoot is a carnivore, like real owls, it probably wouldn't be that efficient. You'd have to raise crops to breed whatever prey animal HootHoot eats (probably one of the rodent pokemon), to feed to the HootHoots, and that extra step creates a lot of caloric inefficiency.
meat cows are slaughtered under 2 years old
rabbits are actually cheaper but i get the point and eater rabbits arent that common
"We could all eat Nurse Joy..." MatPat, my friend, do you know what you just said?
I’m down to eating nurse joy ;)
You didn't account for Protein Poisoning. Eating too much horse meat gives you just that. So that'd be a terrible food to eat all the time. So you'd have to consider other reasons we don't eat certain animals. we could farm a lot of bugs and insects but we dont in the US because it's gross to us. In the poke-lore there might be people who find certain pokemon gross to eat. or even wrong to eat like how in the US we dont eat rats, cats, or dogs etc. A lot of the pokemon are probably viewed in similar ways.  Look at how fast rabbits breed. Some people eat them, but we arent eating them like chickens because they have the same problem as horses. you get protein poisoning if you eat it too often. There's some old tale about a a bunch of settlers who moved to the mountains, couldnt farm in the winter, and only had rabbits to hunt and eat,b ut there was plenty of rabbits. They all ate a lot of rabbits, but still starved to the death or something.
Do you think oak at gary raticate
Day 8 of asking for another Omega Mart video.
Vegan teacher watching this video: 😶
The only problem I have with this video (aside from when MatPat said Garchomp and Gabite showed up on screen) is that he didn't read up on Mudbray's and Mudsdale's diet from their Pokedex entries, which mainly state that they get their nutrients from mud. The problem with this is that animals that eat mud and dirt exclusively have very poor meat, for example mudcatfish, they bottom feed off of muddy ground underwater and end up with poor tasting meat since their nutrients come from the mud. Having something with very poor tasting meat quality as your main source of red meat isn't very appealing, so alternatives would definitely be chosen for that food role.
The intro was just the apitizer
One problem that you ignored: whales eat only meat, so wailord is far more inefficient than IRL lobsters due to  the calourie loss along the food chain.
You forgot seafood
hmm, do you have to cook a rapidash, if you want red meat.
Caviar is just fish eggs
You can eat nurse joys
matT NO
@ 00:35  AND FILM THEORY
I actively try to eat exotic foods
But...not every region has every Pokemon. So what would be the most sustainable food source Pokemon in generation? Kanto? Johto? Etc...
😶
Hey MatPat in kindergarten two Nugget uses 100 nuggets to enter the nugget cave. In game theory you said hey would need billions of nuggets to survive the fall. However when the kindergarteners fell in the hole with out the nuggets they still live. Is 100 nuggets enough and if not how squishy are the 100 nuggets?
This ignores the toughness of the meat, but I’d say it’s a good and very firmly based theory. It does bring about the question of what fish they would eat, most likely Magicarp would be the most common but that’s overlooking pokemon like goldeen.
Vegans and vegetarians didn't like this video...
Matt Patt: Nurse Joy is a pokemon Also Matt Patt: You should eat Pokémon
Hoothoot looks like just a giant ball on legs so yeah it'd probably give a lot of meat. xD
Did…. Did he just call a Gabite… Garchomp?!
Bold of u to think Ill feel guilty about eating a plant type.
whats that cool music at 12:30 of the video
I think... im gonna be ..Vegan?
I think it worth noting that hunter-gatherers have a far more diverse diet than people in agricultural societies.
# CANNIBALISM
Is it concerning that this video made me extremely hungry?
Okay, but miltank doesn’t evolve,
Noooooooooooooooooo
pidgey clones? pretty sure you mean garbage birds
As a person who loves fish and chicken I would definitely eat my magic kaarp for dinner
Fun fact, the apple isn’t a part of applin.
I am a masachist for watching this xD
Would eating a shiny Pokémon have bad effects on you?
I wouldn't mind eating a Nurse Joy... or three... at once... Giggity. ;P
If you could pick any video game to get stuck in. Theoretically what games Could you Live in without going insane. Mentally and Physically. Im already thinking of like games that don't have a Food meter... Would that mean you don't need food or like a separate Category.
3:14 isn’t she a pokemon
Thank for covering that farms are a business like any other  Like Pokemon so thank you for covering this thank you for
crap now im hungy
What if i dont want to eat pokemon?
6:35 This was one of the weirdest and uncomfortable thing I have ever seen from MatPat. And coming from the guy who often talks about haunted animatronics controlled by murdered children, that's quite something
I can imagine that Brock would rather eat out Joy
Give me the farm sim nintando you cowerds
Por animals mom where is my beef
"The only things that outclass it's weight are Legendaries"  *Shows Mega Metagross*
only slowpoke tail there useless
comic theory!
"Which is why we eat chickens, not ostriches."  Meanwhile in South Africa: Ostrich biltong.
Brock surely wants to eat nurse Joy
I AM A vegetarian !!!!!!!!!👿
That thumbnail looks so cursed XD
I think you needed to have taken the pokemon TYPE into consideration...mudsale is so heaven because of its type...it’s meat is probably half clay!
The farm explanation is more than the lore. Good job matpat XD
"Eating Nurce Joy"   Phrasing matpat
Don't forget that they say that magiKarp is a delicacy
Do not eat your pikachu DO NOT EAT YOUR PIKACHU
NO!
Mudsdale definitely tastes bad.
I just realized if you eat Pikachu you would  die  🤔
Therapist: Anime matpat isn't real, he can't hurt you. Anime matpat: 0:17
Wait a second, that wasn't a garchomp it was actually a gabite
Does eating your Bulbasaur make you a vegan?
So basically if pokemons are humans humans are eating humans?
What vegetarian and vegan would eat in Pokemon world
Hey Nurse Joy your looking kinda tasty 🍗🍗🍗🍖🍖🍖🍔🍔🍔🍕🍕🍕🍤🍤🍤🍩🍩🍩🍞🍞🍞🍘🍘🍘
you forgot one of the biggest factors tho, is the meat tasty?
Well it also comes down to region. Quite a few pokemon are regional sooo. Mango would have more Miltank products than Kalos. Kinda like the real world, it's different everywhere. So you gotta get out there and try them all!
I’m a Carniveggitarian.I only eat plant type Pokémon.
All Pokemon: FLIGHT HIM!!!
I'm realizing that Pokémon weights make absolutely no sense...
RIP BDG unravelled your videos are missed by many
i'm impressed by someone plotting out the incubation period and growth rates compared to total yield, but i gotta disagree with hoothoot being the main source of poultry, if you take into account the percentage of bone mass in the overall 21.2kg of animal there, how much of it is actually edible meat if the spine leading to the huge talon is just a column of bone?
Mat pat threw film theory to the wolves in this intro.
4:38 I’m African I love goat meat
wait isnt it canon magikarp are consumed??
IM MUSLIM I DONT EAT PORK
Reggie.
The first nurse comment wasn’t funny. The subsequent thousand were even less funny. Hahahahaha. Me like nurse , nurse hot. Me eat nurse?! Ha ha.
I’m glad this turned hard in the direction of fictional considering the non fictional prelude that made no scientific sense. It was basically, there are hundreds of thousands of edible plant sources but people get protein from mostly beef and chicken 🤦‍♀️ And that, food theorists, is how we’re gonna pretend to scientifically analyze eating Pokémon.
can I eat McDonald’s instead right not Pokémon like why pokèmon
Can’t you just use rare candy
actually applin are just the wyrm part, they are just inside of an apple-like fruit, and can actually leave the fruit whenever they want. It doesn't actually become part of their body until they evolve Therefore, no, Applin do not grow on trees
"and Garchomp" *shows Gabite*
Honestly I would go for the Pokemon that is the least sentient
i love to eat my friends
Yea I'd definitely eat nurse joy
Applin is confirmed : Worm
Mat pat:the main thing MONEY Me:soooo do you have any money 💴  Mat pat again: well yeah Me:where do you live Mat pat:1342679 Me:….. Mat pat:hello? Me:ohhhh yeah! Mat pat:hey now I’m broke! Me:haha!
Don't forget that in sword and shield you can make a sausage curry for several pig pokemon, or feed what are clearly drumsticks to a vast array of bird pokemon, at least one of which that fried food must've come from
I’ll call you food Theory
I would think mudbray and mudsdale meat would taste like dirt, literally.
PETA definitely didn’t like this one
Got it catch them all
MatPat: most people don't eat lobsters and crabs!  people in china and stuff:
Owls aren’t kosher mattpat hoothoot would not be a viable food source for the Jewish community
What happened to the intro
Hear me out geodude
12:28 Wailord/Hrashio is the FLOT WAIL POKEMON of course it's going to be light lol.
Honestly, Vegetarians would have it easy. All you need to do is grow berries and vegetables, and if you want to have some Pokémon by your side, then raise a Tropius and a Appletun. Both of them grow food on them (Banana-like fruits and Apple Pie-like crust respectively), and they will happily share with you as long as you take care of them, love them, and feed them.
no, matt. i don't wanna eat my Pokémon.  -everyone
he said pork is a main part of the meat we eat, AHA! I HAVE ONLY HAD 1 BITE OF PORK IN MY USELESS LIFE!
Shuckle juice.
What pokemon should I eat?... Wait, nurse Joy is a pokemon right?...
I love my original Blaziken from ruby but dammit ik torchics got some bussin chicken wings
Alright, I hate you.
No wonder the hamburgers at my school taste weird
What the cat doing 9:12
U use gabite
Ground type meat is too gritty for me tho
9:55 what's the koffing joke that's floating over my head?
Do Pokemon eat people??☠🤔🤔
No. I don't think i will
I hope people know there are just certain Pokémon you just shouldn’t eat like the ones that are ghosts and the one that’s a rock and there’s literally a Pokémon made out of garbage
Now I'm wording what berries would be the best for you to eat
I would eat tepig
E
How dare you *hugs my pokemon*
You convinced me im gonna eat my cat.
Are we gonna brush over the fact he called metagross a legendary sorry for my spelling
u spelled appletun wrong
So i can eat nurse joy?
"Garchomp"  *proceeds to show gabite*
I'm curious to know if the results would change if you included how many offspring are produced per generation. After all, chickens lay dozens of eggs each, while cows only birth what, one or two which lasts them years?
Shows a Gabite instead of a Garchomp
Pikachu's milkstache 😍😍😍
huh
APPLIN IS IN A APPLE
if nurse joy is a pokemon and you should eat your pokemon............
Additionally, you want to avoid eating plant based Pokemon, in fear of enraging Nuptup, destroyer of worlds
hey, just a thought what if mudbray's weight is due to its massive bone and hoofs? so the edible part might not be proportionate compared to a chicken
instead of paltry, he should have said poultry
I wonder that chandelure tastes like garlic
I get my protein from healthy food!
7:37 that is a gabite
Um. Magikarp?
I got some words for u ditto and slowpoke. = making bank from those slowpoke tails lol
Nooooooooo
i am a vegetarian so nope not eating my Pokemon
I feel like Charmander would give you heartburn
I’m unsubscribing
Shouldint this be game theory
I'd imagine they'd sell Pokemon at Omega Mart
YES SOMEONE GINALLY MADE ONE, IVE HAD THIS STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR 2 YEARS
Vaporean
MatPat: Beef is a animal
Is that Gabite there just so we can point out it isn't a Garchomp in the comments?
I would like some pidgy I love chicken
I believe your nurse joy theory she is definitely a Pokémon but if she is one would a Pokéball work on her and what would she taste like
I would eat nurse joy.
Even if gigantamax(or just even dynamax) is taken into account, will pikachu be actually edible?
you cant eat magickarps tho.. their just scales and bone
Is nurse joy vegetarian
Sorry but this freking me out why woyld you eat a tauros or other pokemon their cute cool happy
i am shocked and offended you would prefer to collab with yourself rather than call up ro
Food theory. hey game theory can I collab with you game theoy. oh yeah sure food theory were the same person matpat. I am lonely

In the first Pokémon show far-fetched was eaten in the Pokédex entry why does people not mention that
In the Kalos region there’s a thing where you eat stuff like miltank steak in a battle thing
The blue tier should be fitness theory
Next channel food theory
Pokémon, gotta catch em' all! Pokémon, gotta eat them all!
Food theory cereal confirmed?
MatPat makes a detailed video on what cute Pokémon would be best to chop up and consume, meanwhile I'm only upset that he's butchering the names of so many Pokémon. Priorities.
Do a vegetarian one anyway would be epic
Why no bugs?
To heck with Miltank, milk a Machamp 🤣
Matpat: "or just eat Nurse Joy"  Me: ohohoho I'll be eating her for sure...
Making a food in the Pokémon world video and not speaking about Magikarp feels wrong to me.
Mmmmmm we could eat nurse joy mmm
Self-Colab. Finally someone smart. If you can't collaborate with someone, just do it with yourself! Easy!
It ain't appropriate, but Ima say it.   Brock would "eat" nurse Joy
NO!!!!!!!!!!
Peta is gonna have a field day here
do this with fish but i know the answer is magikarp
Hey Matt Pat it isn't pokmon its pokeamom
Great video (I mean it) but I would like to inquire about Chansey’s eggs. I know their main purpose is for healing, but the Pokedex describes them as highly nutritious (possibly several times more than chicken eggs). Besides, a single Chansey can produce who knows how many eggs which seems pretty efficient to me. (As a bonus, no murder has to happen :D )
Pokemons have thoughts and understand English how could you eat them you fucken barbarian
"welp, squirtle... lets try you out"
i eat  punds of lobser per year because i dot eat it
I have to assume Arceus is the tastiest Pokemon. Arceus or mew.
Matpat : eat out your nurse joys.  Steph frantically searching for her nurse costume and pink wig.
The apple you ate wasn’t the Pokémon it’s the worm inside
imagine if vegan teacher saw this one
the fact that u think people need to eat Pokémon is actually concerning because who would think this stupid idea. 1st of all, the title is wrong you should say people do eat Pokémon and YOU think people should. 2nd, I can kinda  see people eating the Pokémon that looks like an apple but there are other animals AND fruit that are out there not just Pokémon. 3rd, Pokémon are used for fighting purposes and not for eating. 4th, just because people eat Pokémon doesn't mean that U should. I can go on and on and on but i am not because this commit will get long so i will end it here.
For Christmas you should do an episode on if Santa could survive all the cookies he would consume.
Not sure the mud donky would be the best option for red meat after all you forgot to take into acount the dirt flavor it would have. Most people would not willingly eat food with dirt on it so most likely the taest of meat that taest like you dropped it in dirt would probably not work flavor wise for most people.
I wanna eat a gardevour
Also just thought of something, regional variation in diet. I mean mudsdale would be used in alola but what about other regions in the world? It may be more difficult to raise a mudsdale or get one into the region.
There was one episode I saw as a kid where ash went into a shop for burgers and i was thinking mabey it was milktank meat,I was heartbroken
My Ideal food-mons (there is a theme)   Applin: Applin is actually a *wyrm* in a apple. Thus meaning it would be safe to munch on its apple. Yet, he might not like that...  Chansey and Blissy: lets just say, it's Eggselent. That is all.   Tropius: ASH, GET THE BANANA.  Slowpoke: Mmmm... Free Tails.   Staryu and Starmie: Might not taste good, but would be growing back after each cut.  Ribombee: No you can't eat the bee. The pollen puffs however, are yummy with great health effects! Yet, don't anger your bee. It might toss a badpuff in your mouth.  Snowver and Abomasnow: This seems like a unlikely choice, until you realize that during the Spring, they grow tons and tons of berries!   Swirlix: WE HIT THE MOTHER LOAD!!!! This guy has fur sweet and sticky like cotton candy, the fur. Just the fur. Trim the fur, get free Sweets.  Those are my personal picks,.
But pat you said in the nurse joy vid HUMANS TRANSFORM IN TO POKEYMON I NEED AN ANSWER PLEASE
Mega meta grooms is not a lengendary
Apple is a worm
You just know pretty easy to know
Brock has been going for the nurse all this time
Matpat: Says Garchomp Also Matpat: Shows a Gabite
All our Pokémon are belong to us! You will not eat our Pokémon!
Applins DO NOT grow on trees. The apples they live in do. The apple is not a part of the Applin, the Applin lives in the apple.
knowing that humans and pokémon were very close in evolution at one point (according to the last video) calls to question the morals of eating them 🧐
0:44 when he was saying that, the episode was on my recommended
do you conduct this research with  gluten free people in mind? I know you probably don't but may you do one gluten free research episode. I don't find alot of youtubers talk about gluten intolerance. what can fill up a gluten intolerant person can be cost effective? just wondering
Hey wait a minute If nurse joy is a Pokémon, and Pokémon are snacks....
WHY SHUCKLE
matpat what are you on
Which Pokemon is farmed could very well be based on region.  Example, Kanto/Johto would farm Miltank since it's natural to that region.
I was eating a burger during this video lol
That's a gabite, my guy
This guy’s such a nerd. Love it
Haven’t watched yet, but I hope he references the Polygon episode Brian David Gilbert did
i hate you but i still liked the vid for some reason
Wot https://youtu.be/JJyloRJ5Hzs
In Pokémon camp you get xp by playing with ur pokemon
Imagine these industrial meat farms full of dittos.
There called regional birds
It's much more likely they go by the real world equivalents like Tauros and Miltank, and probably Pidgey because it's so common. There are also several fish pokemon along with Krabby, and plenty of normal type pokemon that might be  edible if compared to real world equivalents.  I mean it's pretty obvious that in a world where animals have all been replaced by pokemon, that people would eat pokemon instead of animals. Just nobody wants to admit it.   But we have animals for pets too, so we're not that different.

Not to be that guy, but shouldn't mudsdale be a mule?
Your crazy
Ya know,  youre a married man, but ill eat nurse joy for ya buddy.  Live vicariously through me.  ;)
I want me some theory-o's
wailord can fly, i think thats more surprising than it weighing 877 lbs
Matpat... We literally have a Miltank Ranch in gen 2. Why would they be using Skiddo for milk...
6:35   sus
So nurse joy is a Pokémon and they eat Pokémon I see something connecting here and I do not like it
I wonder what different regions(generations) would have specifically as their most efficient sources
I remember that you're able to catch large fishing nets worth of magikarp in the pokemon world because they're super abundant, but he didn't go into the fish section
Wait just because wailers is lighter doesn’t mean it has less meat wouldn’t it be possible for mudbray and mudsdale to just have very dense meat that might end up being tough to chew?
Got a pokemon ad
The mudbray probably tastes like dirt however, considering it's a ground type 😂
theory did irl animals become Pokemons
So if she’s a Pokemon so therefore you can eat her? worded weirdly that sounds very wrong
Nurse Joy is a Pokémon is the video that sent me here.   Which was kind of funny. Because when I first started that video, I thought... I wonder if there are any other  ________ THEORY channels (other than film theory and obviously game theory)  I am glad to see the circle icon is getting filled.   Just 1 more theory Channel to go.
Maybe we could eat a Metagross or a Steelix...
mmm.. MEW!
Mukrow and Fetchling lmao
..um..love me some nurse joy
Need to catch legendary Pokemon and eat it
Ash ate magikar
That one guy who will eat a zoobat
Forgot Magikarp. In the games, several fisherman fish for them. And plus, they're everywhere.
hello
I agree with the criteria of your ranking but that's exactly why I have to ask: What about Magikarp? I think Magikarp would make perfect sense as a main food source. Fish is not an uncommon thing to eat and food also has a very strong cultural background. In some regions of the earth fish is traditionally consumed more than elsewhere. Now all the regions of the Pokémon world are Islands or Peninsulas, making it very plausible that the sea plays a dominant role as a source of food. Magikarps are not only able to inhabit both salty and fresh water, unlike the other Pokémon you mentioned they're common in EVERY region of the Pokémon world. The waters there are swarmed by Magikarps. So you wouldn't even have to raise them, allthough they hatch very quickly - you can simply walk over to the nearest water place and catch them! Probably even without the use of Pokéballs or the help of trained Pokémon since Magikarp can't really defend itself anyways. Just grab a fishing rod or hurry down to the market when the big fishing boats return - even the supermarkets in the cities gotta be packed with fresh, delightful Magikarp.
The guy who ate gardevoir: 😳
Umm I totally wouldn’t play a Pokémon farming simulator..totally
I wonder if Psyduck would act like LSD because of their powers
13:23 by the way in like the very first episode ever, there's a bouffalant farm (it also shows up quite a few times)
Eating pokemon is like eating dogs or cats
“would put up less of a fight cracked me”
matpat, you put a picture of gabite while mentioning garchomp
My only concern about ur math on mudsdale. Is that its a ground type. So there's probably a large amount of that mass thats inedible or not good tasty earth stuff. Like dirt is edible  but you not gonna order a plate of it medium rare...
But wait, Matpat. What about transportation costs? Some of those Pokémons only exist in far away regions like Kalos.
what is your favoroite pokemon min is jilipuf
In theory, its plausible, but i do hold one major complaint on this. It's not region specific. You make mention of cows vs goats in real world farming around the world, but you don't do the same for the 8 regions of Pokemon.  Take Kanto and Johto for example, they would not naturally have access to Skiddo milk, but they have an abundance of Miltank milk, and since these two regions are quite literally a single river apart, they easily have shared resources, but Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola and Galar are all very far from each other and it very well couldn't share the same ecosystem. (Heck, Alola alone has 4 ecosystems to keep an eye on, all very diverse and demanding different stock of available resources.)   Across the table, the Pokemon listed are good options, but they're far from ideal in practice. Not to sound totally nitpicky about it, but I would not consider this an accurate list unless it's verifiable that all Pokemon listed can be found and easily raised in every region.  But that's just my take on it~
Anyone else notice how totally bonkers the weights are for the Pokemon? I mean seriously a Tauros a buffalo sized bull is only a hundred and ninety-four lbs?
I wonder what a ghost type pokemon would taste like?
Remember when Brock used his frying pan as a drying pan?
Mat...Sometimes you scare me.
There absolutely should be a Pokémon professor who studies Pokémon edibility
Who doesn't wanna eat nurse joy😳😩
1:00
Seafoods?
5:30 n i c e
Hoot hoot looks like a cooket chicken leg
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!?
Wait what
11:20 You sounded like you are singing or rather rapping HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHA
mudbray and mudsdale eat dirt. Like literally dirt. I don't think they'd taste very good no matter how much meat they've got on em. I'm pretty sure most of that weight would be due to the literal rocks in their stomachs. Gotta account for taste. No point if they're inedible.
Who cares it's the same as life anyways so what's the point of this
this is definitely one of them youtube videos that just destroys your childhood
There are 2 major factors you missed in this:  1) Pokemon differ from region to region, so where one region might indeed feast on mudbray, another region might use something very different (like on an island, Magicarp's might be the food of choice, being a fast to hatch fish). 2) This assumption of yours is based solely on growth speed/ weight of the pokemon, but another VERY important factor is taste!  Mudbray's might taste HORRIBLE, whereas something else slightly smaller might taste very good, and still fall into the fast to grow category.
You have to consider taking out all the guts and some bones
Mat pat you forgot that in the first episode of pokemon animals wear real and then they removed them in epasode 2
Nurse joy
"food theory YES YOU SHOULD EAT YOUR POKEMON" "Nurse joy is a pokemon'
THE VEGAN TEACHER IS COMING
Pretending that Pokedex Pokemon weight = meat weight is just plain stupid.
How would Arcus
Hey Matpat, I think grilled Nurse Joy would be the best.
Magic harp is made of bone
Ok I may be wrong but wasn’t the channels called food theory and Gil theory. 😳😳😳 is this a…… theory?!?!?
The problem with the dairy analysis is the divergence goals of herd growth vs milking period/production. The analysis did not consider milk production period or volume produced. Assuming the "real world" comparison a slower leveling rate would imply a longer adolescent period and a longer milking period per pregnancy. The larger mass of Miltank and slower growth rate implies more milk production for a longer period of time.
i hate this and you that not very family friendly
If people eat Pokemon, does that mean there are Pokevegans and P.E.T.P (People for the Ethical Treatment of Pokemon)?
.....MatPat.......are you okay?
I mean the one you get milk from would be a good one for meat as well, you'd be constantly impregnating them to get the milk do you may as well eat the young males.
Pokemon vegans are triggered
0:01 G E N E R A L  K E N O B I, Y O U   A R E  A  B O L D  O N E!!!!
At0 the starting  of this vid there was a pokemon unite 😂😅😭😅😂🤔🤔😛👀
Hoot hoot gon be gamey af.
Pokemon food
but you said in your other video that pokémon are humans so if you eat pokémon then you are cannibalist
HE HAS KILLER AHHHHH
BUT i had a pokemon card that was a 1999 year old first Edition weepinbell that had regular bird sitting on it's head.  So are there regular animals in the Pokemon world???
i eat onyx
Im more of a pokemon Food guy to be honest.
It's as same not being  vegan in the real world and the pokemon world
ok cool but can you eat nurse joy?
Magic carp and chips anyone and if you are not a fish fan then try are famous Tauros, burgers just got up try the breakfast scrambled Exeggcute with cut up Stantler  sausage.
there is a reason and I bet you know this but people don't like mutton normaly. So lambs are harvested early for the reason kinda.....
Also I live on a farm. Sheep good!
Also pork is at a what I heard a 40 year high.
I do wonder what applin taste like?
Mudbray/Mudsdale are covered in mud and have super dense bones. Probably not the best meat source. Please re-think this theory.
I'm sure Humans have found very useful uses for the Vaporeon Pokemon 😳😳😳
Its a coincidence that i got a door dash ad before watching this video
PETA and the vegans are gonna have a fun retort to this one.
I will eat a mr mime
😫😨😰
I'd eat Nurse Joy if you know what I mean wink wink  Also, I just started rewatching the entire anime, and season one episode seven you can see a ton of non-pokemon fish swimming in the cerulean city gym aquariums. I'm convinced that plenty of non-sentient animals exist in the world of pokemon, its just that they aren't shown for the most part because thats not what the viewers want to see.
Mudbray's legs are it's heaviest part though same for mudsdale
You didn't analyze aquaculture and fisheries, but Magikarp fits with your "fast hatching" criteria, and canonically people do eat them
ahh yess kan-to
"I don't always believe all the theories that we produce..." MatPat, That's singlehandedly the scariest thing I've heard all Halloween!
Nurse Joy might be the most delicious 😋
7:33 Is that a GaRcHoMp?
Canto special!! Fried zubat with a seared pidgey wings .
that you will
That thumbnail looks disturbing.
Yummy yummy in my tummy.
0:15 LOL LOOK AT HIS REACTION! 看你能不能看懂第
7:34 thats a gabite..not a garchomp
Matpat , what about the regional diets of the pokemon universe. Each region had different pokemon so by that logic every region would now be able to depend on just skiddo or hoothoot. So what would be the diet for every region would be an awesome video. Thank you. 😊
POV: you got a bad Pokemon
MatPat: "Pre-evolved forms of Dragonite, Tyrannitar, and Garchomp take..."    The pictures shown: Dragonite, Me: Okay The pictures shown: Tyrannitar Me: Good The pictures shown: Gabite Me: Wait, hold on, WHAT!!!!!!????!???!?!? THAT is NOT GARCHOMP. *Rant starts*
glad I'm not the only one who thinks that some pokemon would be delicious to eat
Dining on palkia tonight
Look at the food theory  that logo mat shows on screen and tell me it doesn't look like joshDub intro but without the music I'm starting to see a pattern
We eat rabbit too.
WHATs WRONG WITH YOu
huh now i know game theory is female
First i saw how pokimon could have intercorse with humans and now this?
Can a person survive on cookies alone?
I wanna eat nurse joy😏
What about the Bug  the Pokemon eat
I wanna eat me a magicarp now
I see what you did there Mat. Making a video on eating pokemon and then making a video on Nurse Joy being one.
Gotta eat them all!
Have to remember the main reasons that chickens, pigs and cows are farmed is that before  modern technology there was only a very limited number of animals that could be domesticated. This is because of 4 main reasons, firstly the animal must be friendly, you could attempt to farm tigers but they will try and eat you. The worst a chicken can do it peck you kinda hard  Secondly they need to be feedable, everyone knows that pigs will eat anything you give them. You can’t feed pandas that way they are too picky. You also can’t farm pure carnivores purely because of thermodynamics, 10 pound of grass makes a pound of steak and 10 pounds of steak makes a pound of tiger. It just doesn’t make sense to waste food you could eat to farm a second animal  Third they need to have a family hierarchy we can exploit if you catch and take the alpha horse all the others will fall in line (usually). Catch a zebra and the others don’t care they travel in packs as a defence mechanism not as a family hierarchy   Finally they need to be sexually active and grow up fast. Pandas again can’t be farmed because of this, without human intervention these guys would be extinct right now because their mating preferences are just too much. Whereas cows are sexually active when you put a bull into a field of cows they will all be pregnant by the end of the week. Growing up fast is critical as well, it takes a chicken ~18 weeks to be considered mature, elephants can take 5-7 years to reach sexual maturity  Obviously in today’s time the number of farmable animals has increased but there is still only a finite number that can be farmed, I would assume that these factors are the same in the Pokemon world. Taurus and Bouffalant would be great to farm but they are effectively tanks on hooves that will destroy and cage/barrier in its path
hey pokemon is slaves,why is no one protesting
there goes my childhood. Wave it goodbye!
12:24 DONT EAT MY HOMIE WHY NO NO WHALE MEAT PLEASE NO
Grass Type Pokemon: exists   Vegans: *Wait...*
I wouldn't say a Pokemon more she could be a clone
3:14 says nurse joy is a pokemon then calls her a regular civillian, which one is it matpat
Amazing theory. Sadly, the total weight includes the bones which is typically not editable
You're not taking into consideration the fact that most of the regions are shown to be islands(I might be misremembering this though), and fish would be a big contender for a person's daily dose of protein. In which case I feel like magikarp would be up there for efficiency
Mr. beast would definitely do a video EATING 10,000$ GROUDON video.
That intro…
4:32  "Beef is one of the most profitable animals"  - MatPat 2021
"And garchomp" *Shows gabite*
You CAN eat ostriches, but it's actually a red meat like stake. Yes I have had it, but yah it's not as efficient as a wee little chicken.
Food theory: you should eat your Pokemon Also game theory: nurse joy is a Pokemon
I don't like this
can i eat nurse joy ;]
Tep i g pork
What would be the best way to sustain a fishing community?
I think slowpoke is a better investment
fairy types might be most eaten because it would be considered high class because they look nice or mabye its like swirlix you know the pokemon thats 80 percent cotton candy and fairy pokemon look like candy more than any other type
mat how dare you you put gabite instead of garchomp i will never forgive you fot this my friend.
Vegan Teacher while watching this video :   ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌ ✅
I want to eat nurse Joy 😉😝
Applin isn't the apple
Miltank makes 5 gallons a day, and requires milking... I mean the goats may mature faster... but if they produce less than a gallon a day then 1 Miltank will be a better producer if it produces for even 1/5 of the time... the goat milk may be delicious but Miltanks is extremely nutritious... I get that Miltanks milk entries in the dex are ignored by your equation of growth rate... O.o and YOUR GOAT IS A MILK PRODUCING BUSH!... it takes no food and gets it's energy from the sun... I get your reasoning...   Skiddo is a milk producing plant that has no info on milk production rate that I can find, your video says it's delicious... that's a reason consumers would pay more and farmers would work more...  Miltank entries to make it the probable winner: - Its milk is packed with nutrition, making it the ultimate beverage for the sick or weary. - Miltank gives over five gallons of milk on a daily basis. Its sweet milk is enjoyed by children and grown-ups alike. People who can't drink milk turn it into yogurt and eat it instead.  I will let you have your delicious Sun fed goat farm... but I BET you that miltank farms will produce more milk... and Stake... So lots of milk til slaughter of a heavy beast... ^.^ (If the goat gets it's energy and it's milk from the sun... how sustainable do you think that milk is? if it's a fast producer; I bet it's water... if it's rich in the good stuff... I bet it takes forever...)
Meanwhile desert is easy, if you ignore the screams of Vanilluxe
7:39 is the cutest thing I've seen all day
7:36 that’s not garchomp I don’t remember it’s name but that’s the second evolution of garchomp
Hey how the faq does a horse weigh that a FOOKIN WHALE
"we're not going to factor in evolutions, because to evolve you have to battle" (ignoring how that is also wrong) "now let's use exp gain groups to qualify how efficient they are!" not your best work, man
Aplin is a worm hes not the Apple hes just inside check pokemon snap new
.... Is no one going to mention that he used gabite when talking about garchomp?
That's completely awful
6:35 never licked my screen so fast before 🤕
Piedove and Muckrow…  *Mat you disappoint me*
I watched this right after your “nurse joy is a Pokémon” video.
Pokémon gota eat em all Pokémon
The vegan teacher is gonna sue you the moment she sees this lol
The intro reminds me of joshdub   Edit: I have NEVER, I repeat,NEVER have ate crab or lobster
Welp this just proves that I can now eat my Miltank for a nice steak dinner  😋
I challenge that Hoothoot is not the best poultry option of pokemon when you consider time and other resources and submit that Doduo would be significantly more meat for only a little bit longer incubation time
I always try to avoid remembering or thinking about how they eat Pokemon. But now I've been forced to understand and accept it.
i have a challenge for you matpat. jack has a step sister named ana and ana has a half sister named emily how are jack and emily related
6:35 i could have gone my entire life without seeing this
10:13 i think that might be true for real world but magikarps can survive out of water a lot of time in the Pokémon world and as said in the video they take almost nothing to Hatch and raise(obviously ignoring garydos)
idk about you guys but im eating out my gardevoir
Can't wait to eat Nurse Joy
Dont eat pokemon never they are your pet
Hi Mattpat its me again don't eat a pokemon don't grab a snickers because it won't make your day better its just make it sweeter grab a cupcake have a great Doki Doki day 👁
Did this turn from a theory to a learning thing4:09-8:24
7:39 that's a gabite not a garchomp man
If i remember correctly I remember seeing the pokedex description of Barraskewda, it says (at least in spanish) that his meat is surprisingly delicious.
I wonder how a drapion tastes like? I guess I should just try rat poison at this point-
Never thought about this oh my word...thats hilarious and well thought out! Lol
Would Nurse Joy taste like egg?
W
“Legendaries” *shows picture of mega metagross*
i would gladly eat nurse joy
ummmm....horse meat in my state is illegal
There is literally an ice cream pokemon why do people ask if they eat pokemon?
Matpat: and garchomp. *sir thats a gabite*
Fun fact: MatPat accidentally thought a Gabite is a Garchomp
We need a book theory
I’m glad I’m here somewhat early
the vegan teacher be like:  😠
Anything is edible if you are brave enough
This is the mega crossover food theory film theory and game theory
So, Skidoo is a dairy source , it produces food like miltank  the cow pokemon that maybe makes milk
Alright, so Skidoo is a goat pokemon,  Speaking of which, Skidoo can produce foods like ice cream
I got a theory of Skidoo , this is the Skidoo theory.
THIS IS MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL😠
I'm surprised by how little lobster and crab is consumed in the US.
I not a food theory episode, It a game theory episode
The aplin is actually a worn so  it can just go to a different apple
Ight this man now crazy i will never eat pokemon’s
Imagine the vegan teacher seeing this
You showed gabite not garchomp what's wrong with you
Question... does anyone know where the footage of the plants and trees comes from, I feel like i've seen it somewhere like in a game or something P.S I mean the footage at 2:59
4:31 Matpat: beef is  My brain: what's for dinner
What about ponyta the firehorse Pokemon? It's meat is probably already cooked bc it's made out of fire. Lmao
"It's time to use my drying pan as a frying pan"                                                                           -Not Brock
Brb ima eat my pikachu.
I would think that what routes you lived near would likely impact the pokemon you would primarily consume. Just like in our world where coastal villages tend to eat more fish and seafood, villages in the pokemon world would have local foods based on what pokemon are predominant in their local routes.
About to ruin my child dream
I wonder how legendaries taste...
What about ditto?
First you tell us, humans are Pokemon.  Now you are telling us to eat Pokemon. Hanniba: "Where have I put that bottle of Chianti?"
If you were to replace the stomach acid with water in an alive person, could they theoretically cook an egg with the warmth they produce? This is the dumbest question ever but I want a scientific opinion.
go ahead !!! eat those who are lesser than you!!! But if you lay your hands on the jigglykind you shall regret it!!

Wait if nurse joy is a Pokemon then...
Technically Farfetch'd was almost hunted to extinction
Thats pokemon abuse
Best Milk Pokémon is still Milk Tank  The reason why Milktank is the more better milk providing Pokémon is because  Milktank provided all of the  Alola Region since Kiawe’s parents are the only Alola farmers with Milktanks  And Milktanks are already fully grown
The thing with Mudsbray and Mudsdale is that most of the weight is from actual mud. They eat, play and cover themselves in mud. And we can agree that if you have a basic bucket of mud that can be quite heavy
Um... I think what makes mudbray and mudsale so heavy is mud... and you wouldn't want to eat mud
Imagine a Pokémon game where you had to hunt Pokémon and then sell their bodies for money.
“Eat your pokemon!” *proceeds to get food poisoning from snivy*
I think I’m getting to old for these intros…
that's some fascinating research I think all the other theorists out there might've disliked this
Doing this comment until matpat does A episode on really needing a to pee or holding in your pee
One interesting add on that would be cool would be what common foods per region of pokemon (johto, kanto, etc.) because not all animals are common to every region.  But i doubt that’s like a full video since real world analogies are quick
"Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a Pokemon!" "Food Theory: Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon!" 🤨
Flame Body cuts those steps in half and the exp candies can be used to get fully evolved pokemon so yeah and raid battles are super easy based on your choice and if you can get others to help stocks!
So I should eat nurse joy?      Aight sounds good.
so what youre telling me is that i can eat nurse joy…
can we get a video on seafoods?
You should not eat your Pokemon because Pikachu is a electrical type and if you eat it, it mite shock you and die you. You should eat health stuff instead of pokemon. You should should capture it with a pokeball. It is not okay to eat pokemon. Eat health stuff.
hehehe theory-os good one
So much talking I'm starting to go insane!!!
World you eat your Pokemon
(Mat pat talked about meat)  That vegan teacher: you r hitl##
69 videos, nice.
2:30 Yo, You are in my Head right now!!! I hit this revelation about a year ago when I started cooking more. At first I thought all a knew how to cook was chicken, beef, pork, fish, and a hand full of veggies but as I was shopping online I realized....we only have like 4 types of meat we eat in America regularly. And though I'm not scouting the internet for venison or gator meat, I'd like a little more variety.   Thankfully it's pushed me to learn more cultural dishes from my family like Jerk Chicken and ox tail 😋😋😋 not quite like Grandma makes it but I've got time 😁😁😁
7:38 “garchomp” mat looks like ur editor uh did a uhh
Do a Theory about if an apple a day keeps a doctor away or just getting him closer
Well alright
I really think that most of pokémon character are vegetarian
*pokenom*
its not pie-dow man XD.. Pee-Dove
This was the 69 video
me : hmm what do I remember in this channel CANNIBALISM WEEK
Hoothoot was doomed from the start to this fate, it's a living drumstick.
Why can i imagine matpat walking around the pokemon universe with a fire type starter and cooking everything alive-
would meal replacemeant shakes be good for an apocalypse
What does scorebunny taste like
….Ive always wanted to eat bounsweet…
Well even if all the seafood was more affordable...I still wouldn't eat it because I HATE the taste :D So all the water pokemon are safe from my stomach XD
Your e  maniac
Lol this is ur 69th vid on food theory
EAT. YOUR. POKEMOOOOOOONS!
The image is very cursed.....
Jokes aside, I'm not sure that Nurse Joy being a Pokemon would make eating one more acceptable in the Pokemon world. In our world, a lot of people have strong feelings about eating animals like horses or dogs because they serve or help humans, and very few would be comfortable with the idea of eating other primates despite their not technically being humans because it's just too close for comfort. The idea of eating animals seen as intelligent makes people uncomfortable. Conversely, some people do engage in cannibalism, like the Donner Party for instance... so even if someone did choose eat a Nurse Joy, that act wouldn't necessarily prove she was a Pokemon. That person might well be a cannibal. Even if you do accept the argument that she's a Pokemon, I'm sure given how human she seems and how much she helps everyone, it would bother them at least as much as the idea of eating intelligent animals and service animals would bother us. With that out of the way, my own personal theory is that the diet of people in Pokemon skews towards seafood, because those are depicted as the least intelligent Pokemon, and resemble their real-world counterparts more closely. Also, Pokemon is from Japan, where it was traditionally the case that there were a lot of Buddhists comfortable with eating seafood but not any other kind of meat. That philosophy seems to be at least somewhat reflected in what Pokemon the anime talks about people potentially eating most often.
beef is a animal?
Kinda sus of you, mat
*THIS VIDEO WAS SPONSORED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT*
🤣 Okay... I got a "Pokemon Unite" ad before watching the latest "How to cook your Pokemon"... Not weird at all...😋
🙁
I mean, some people consider pigs as pets rather than food for example.
Mat could you cover the squid game dalgona sugar challenge. maybe cooling it in different ways gives the slab different brittleness or something, sounds like content
this server is pretty cool, i joined yesterday and build a cool fort at TheCreaterGm island
There’s actually a farm of mudbray in the sun and moon series 👁👄👁
Eat the starter Pokémon
Why are you a Pokémon
13:48 got me.
imagine if food theory did a video on the difference between the left and right twix, my mom and sister swear there’s a difference but i can’t taste the difference
Can u do a video on the  keto diet and ketosis, and how to find delicious food for it?
But, really? There's taste that has to brought up? The menu sounds like government food! 😆
this reminds me, i was trying pikachu for the first time yesterday. It tastes very well, and there is a little shock to it!
Time to eat out nurse joy if you know what i mean
Here’s a quick tip for you crack the eggs in a glass first before you put it into the batter it’s easier to pick out shell shards that way then if you put it into a batter immediately there’s really no reason for me to post to comment on this video is in the fact that he probably won’t go back to the cake video
I just got a pokemon ad at the start of the video...
Ima keep it a buck fifty with you that magikarp is expensive af
Hoothoot is an absolute *unit*
this video:yes you should eat your pokemon okay will eat nurse joy
Its not even that hard to level up pokemon. Just make them fight level100 enemies without the enemy attacking or using non offensive moves. Its literally exploitable.
How much spicyness can the human body take
Since digitization of pokemon and items via public terminals strongly indicates a post-scarcity economy, I'm honestly not sure how much weight an efficiency rooted argument holds.
Do not eat me we are not food
He went there…..
I liked how the Nidoran female got out of dodge as soon as he said he'd be talking about edible Pokemon. XD
“Pokémon Can Be Eaten!” “Nurse Joy Is A Pokémon!” *I think we all know where this is going.*
Yea but hoothoot is an owl, pretty sure they dont eat owls
Don't let dream fans rig the votes this year
Donkey meat 🤢
6:34 don’t say it don’t say it don’t say it
Garchomp wait that’s a gabite
That thumbnail though
It never thought that they are eating pokemon when I was a kid. I remember one episode I think team rocket and Ash's friends thought about eating magikarp after being stranded. I just recently realized what the meat is coming from if they don't have regular animals. And It's just seems weird to me that they do.
Weight does not necessarily mean more meat production. Weight can be a number of things including muscle and bone density, which make sense for work horses. Mudbray is heavy but there are definitely larger pokemon that would be producing much more meat
how about no
Yay Pokémon for dinner
Applin Is not the actual apple its a small worm that finds a apple to feed off of and grow.
Let's mix both of the game pokemon game theorys, you can eat nurse joy
If this food theory was right what do we have to eat our Pokémon cards???
This is one of those theories makin me wonder if Mat has ever actually played pokemon or if he just does theories of them to get views, like generally I love his material but sometimes he just seems to make assumptions based on little to no evidence, lots of which can be disproven from common occurences in the games and anime, like he is desperately tryin to find "evidence" which confirms his theories and doesnt even bother considerin' if its true or not just rolls with it, worst offender bein' "link is dead", (which has been disproven by videos you can search for here on yt), but this one has some raging flaws like assuming pokemons sexual maturity when in reality most pokemon (aside from ones within "the undiscovered eggroup" (mostly legendaries and the few baby pokemon, which isnt based on only bein' first form but other definitions ) can create offspring litterally immidiately after hatching at lv.1, and they dont level up or evolve based on time, but enviornmental(evolutionary rocks etc)/victorial-battle circumstances, which has been confirmed in the anime by there being extremely old first stage pokemon (like the elder-treeko in the ep where Ash catches his treeko), and the games having pokemon stay the same no matter how long you have them unless you fill their evolutionary requirements. Then theres the assumptions of the pokemons anatomy like how the pure mudtype Mudsdale being assumed edible when he isnt rven part normal type, making it extremely likely he is make partially or mainly of undigestible material, like how many pure types are composed of inorganic materials. Also occationally some pokemon which seem edible are confirmed by the pokedex/anime to be completely inedible, like magikarp(season 1 ep-17) therefore cant give certain credit to the the hoothoot theory, which seemed to hold most water, compared to the other ones within this video), which reminds me of the gogoat point, miltank has been a confirned pokemon used for its milk since the Johto region and using the fact that its used for its milk in Kalos doesnt mean its better overall, when far more regions have confirmed Miltank as commonly farmed farm-used for milking purposes. Also Miltank is born "fully grown" (single stage evolution), which by his own ligic should be far more ideal then.  On a happier note; Mat means food in Swedish so fun havin' a food theory-channel hosted by someone(differently pronounced but regardless) with that name.  Best wishes to future videos but you know what they say about assumptions, right? :d Also the nurse Joy video was gr8 thank you
But but Pokémon’s are smarter😰
i had a fun idea: a in-universe version of PETA to put the ethics of pokemon treatment and such into the story. I'd add some more spicy depth to how plots can evolve in the future, like having different rules and regulations in certain regions  I'd like it, even if it kinda changes the themes of pokemon from a strategy + eye candy to reflections over human-animal conduct...   it's probably never gonna happen outside a fan creation, since it is a children's... thing (although a "kid's show can contain a level of narrative depth on par with any other type of media)   thanks for reading my pointless internet rambling
matpat you for got about one variable how much the pokemon is used as a pet
Finally, some good fucking food.
This kinda makes me want a game that's like Stardew Valley & Harvest Moon but for the Pokémon world.
heya matpat so when is the food theorie episode of omega mart you said in a few weeks o and this is just a question i am  not mad
Would a ditto be the equivalent to our chicken due to everything tasting like chicken and ditto can be any pokemon???
In another episode game theory  happened to say that people are poke dose that mean we are doing cannibalism
What about seafood just for fun
Eat nurse joy.
Video Idea: How comes when you drink with a straw it taste better? Like any drink taste way better with a straw is it a mental thing or is a something that they put in the straw.
whose gonna eat poor geo dude :/
Let them eat Zubat!
Probably miltanks and tauros
7:38 its amzing he used a pic of gabite
That is something I've never thought about in the Pokemon world! Everything was all fun and games into my lovable Hoothoot was brought into this! 🤣 Poor hoothoot, why you gotta be so dang cute and yet so possibly delicious?! And can we please get a pokemon farming sim game going?  Love your theories and all your channels 💜💜✨✨
I'm gonna start farming pokemon
Video : Why you should eat your pokemon Ad : Pokemon unite
Your videos are really good, I use them as background music when I read
Is cereal a soup?
3:14 “by a regular civilian” nurse joy be like: wattttt
Torchic? No?
What about honey and fruts
12:58    oh yeah, it was only Britain that had the horse meat scandal...
There is a middle finger emoji
Since Mat Pat is saying we should eat our Pokémon I'm gonna eat nurse joy
Fun fact: Did you know that barrakewsda is a pokemon that has been eaten by humans, in its sword pokedex entry says "This Pokémon has a jaw that's as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda's flesh is surprisingly tasty, too."
vote for copper golem
Honey your pignite sandwich is ready
Bro just imagine
Who ever pats editor is, is amazing
Nice video and nice video number
In Sri Lanka we call chicken who are injected with a formula that causes them to grow into adulthood in a few days and slaughtered the next "broilers"
Muslims actually don't eat pork because it is a dirty animal and Muslims can't go near pigs. I thought you might know this because of you drowned theories on game theory
Cool I will see you guys after I eat out my gardevoir
Ngl I feel like Pokemon and sonic are series matpat should stay away from idk why
I've just relisted that bobs burgers is in the opening animation. that made me think if business is so bad how can the burger place stay open?
...the pokemon world...now i look at it diffrently (SCREW YOU MATPAT)
I eat so many different fruits and vegetables and meats, so your food so I wouldn’t eat these
Here at simp farms, we grow and harvest the most wholesome Nurse Joys* for a cheap price**.      *No, it isn't animal abuse. MatPat proved Nurse Joys are Pokemon. ** Therapy for trauma/ruined childhood not included
In my head canon, there are Pokémon used as food. Magikarp is a very common seafood dish. Food Pokémon are very different from their wild counterparts. They are much larger and have been bred to be unable to use any moves. In Kanto and Johto, Tauros and Miltank are bred for meat and milk. Pidgey and Farfetch’d are bred for their eggs and meat. Magikarp and Krabby are popular seafood dishes.   There are regional foods too. Seafood is very popular in Hoenn. Dubwool meat is popular in Galar. Gogoats provide both milk and meat in Kalos. Swellow eggs is a delicacy in Johto.  (One of my OCs, Lady J, while pregnant with Luka, hers and N’s daughter, craved Swellow eggs.)
Hey I saw ash eating magickarp in one episode
*whispers* lamb is not from a baby sheep, they are typically sexually mature and close to fully-grown animals  This is also amazing by the way
Matpat: u should eat your Pokémon Also Matpat: nurse Joy is a Pokémon Me: makes sense
69th video
You used Gabite instead of Garchomp 7:33. ;-;
So I'm a milk lover but if I'm in the pokemon universe I would be drinking goat milk?
SON WHY
I eat ostrich
Game theroy matpat sent me
I got a Pokemon Unite ad before this video
Fun fact: Applin isn't the apple... it's a worm inside the apple... among the reasons it is named Apple-in
Wait you just did a game theory that Pokemon are people. You are sick!
In South Africa you can totally eat ostrich there's actually a shelf in the meat section for it it tastes like a lean beef and costs about the same or a little more than beef.
You forgot rabbits as a food source.
If meat exists in Pokémon, does that mean Virus or bacterial Pokémon exist as well? Is there a "Salmonellette" Pokémon that represents Salmonella?
In the pokemon world there are real animals the episode that misty goes to her sisters jim you can see ash in a clear glass hallway that you can see normal animal go watch it!
Do a theory about poppy playtime
2021 : You should eat your Pokémon and Nurse Joy is a Pokémon 2014 : Humans are Pokémon
7:37 thats a gabite not garchomp
Where's omega mart
You forgot to take the pokemon diet as a consideration to see if the're indeed edible for humans <<
No Mudbray is to cute to eat
Your a bad person..... really though
Awesome
so pokemon farm is basically a giant pokemon arena where they fight each other everyday to grow??
oki
This is probably the darkest food theory episode so far...
Ga
Food Theory Idea: The probability of finding a Mew oreo!
He should have used size instead of weight.
Ayooo
You should talk about some darker topics like the food industry conspiracy Theory
Alright come here charizard
The mere thought of Pokémon as food disturbs me.
Alright, cavalry in the Pokemon World would be horrifying forces of nature and pike tactics developments are going to be severely hampered.
🙂LETS EAT ARCEUS IT MUST BE HOLY FOOD!
ill eat every pokemon
YOU KNOW WHAT?!
I think Austin would agree this is the best way to keep the planet from becoming an absolute hellscape as they evolve.
01:35 Shuckle: Oh my word… I never realized how delicious I was! YYYEEEEAAAHHH SHUCKLE!
Am I the only one who finds it painful when Matpat prounounces Skiddo like there's a second O at the end?
Still waiting to see if things taste better when made with love
I want a Wago Milktank
I wonder what a Nurse Joy Farm would look like. 🤔HHMMMMMMMMmmmm.......
"Pokemon, Gotta Eat Em All"
1:15 I don't think the pokedex meant Appletun itself is eaten, but instead the growths on its back
You forgot about the fish Pokémon
omg you sound like my science teacher
69th video
Would you ever consider doing a theory on “taste tripping” pills? The science behind how it works and of course a demonstration.
do the difference  between gatorade and powerade i need to know
Haha! I gotcha you clever bugger! You forgot one thing! Feed efficiency and ecology! It’s more exciting than it sounds like. There is a reason humans have only only one true carnivore domesticated, cats, and that is solely because them eating the meat, rats, is their job. All other species are either obligate herbivores such as cattle and goats, eating tough plants we are unable to, or opportunistic omnivores willing to eat whatever we give them, even our table scraps, such as dogs and pigs. The reason why is that ten pounds of grass might make one pound of lamb, but it would take ten pounds of lamb to make one pound of wolf. For obvious reasons you just cut out the last step and eat the lamb! If you want to eat the animal, like Matpat mentions you would since he was selecting a meat bird, then he would want something much like a chicken, willing to eat grain or insects and a general omnivore if hungry enough, and they have an incredible feed efficiency. A hoot hoot is clearly an owl, an obligate carnivore! That means you’ll be spending ten pounds of seed to make on pound of ratatta, and another ten pounds of ratatta to make one pound of hoot hoot! Then you may as well just eat the rodent like the Andean Inca people with guinea pigs, and these ones are even more opportunistic, being true omnivores. A little selective breeding and you can get some meat on those rat bones! But if we don’t want Rodent steaks and prefer poultry, then truly ideal boiler might not weigh as much, but will be more feed efficent and faster breeding. That would likely be Pidove. Pigeons which and doves, which Pidove is obviously derived from, have been domesticated for some time, are opportunistic, fast breeding, easily selectively bred for specific traits like maximum meat, and best of all are highly opportunistic, literally known as rats with wings due to their varied diet. And beyond that, owls are slower breeders. The reason chickens are so incredible is that they breed so incredibly fast! The turn around on a rooster and a few hens is unbelievable! An owl, a predator, lays a few eggs and spends some considerable time raising them. Meanwhile an omnivore like a pigeon, or rather pidove, is not as fast breeding as chickens, but what is, and are indeed faster than owls, hoot hoot. Eat that, literally! No harsh feelings, didn’t mean to say that rudely, just meant to make a pun, not anything like that, I just wanted to throw you my own theory! Thank you for reading and a shoutout to the 6 rules of domestication!
Halloween Video idea: how to correctly carve a pumpkin
matpat making bird theory ☝️🤭😄
Such Bullshit. :/
Make a food theory video on the taco bell... sandwich taco and settle the debate on whether it's a taco or a sandwich.
The best not click bait, click bait ever
Vegan teacher gonna fail mat pat if she sees this
7:35 that’s a gabit not a garchomp
After seeing the comment in Game Theory saying MatPat suggests us to eat Nurse Joy, now I know it's official. (By the way, shall we put that 'anime/manga googly eye tongue out face' while eating?)
In episode 3 when Pidgeotto ate a worm
I eat pastamon
Let me remind you: this is the 69th video uploaded to this channel
Capturing and enslaving pokemon for the rest of their life, while using them as a sport material relief, eventually fainting them in the process = ❌  Eating them = ✅
matpat should make a theory on minecraft live

What if you only have a charizard? And your hungry, with no source of food? Good luck trying to eat that
14:17  The diet of terrorists and war criminals.
He has 3 channels. Game Theory,Film Theory,Food Theory.
Someone wants a Charizard Steak Curry?
The only issue with the horse pokemon are that they are ground types...presumably weighing so much as they have earth like bodies...wouldn't go down well for meat...
Magikarp would be very efficient, Old Rods are very common, Magikarp show up in almost every body of of water in the Pokemon world. It's pretty sizeable and would likely eat basic fish food.
Technically everything is edible once :P
I'm honestly wondering if any normal person would even say "matpat is not doing this for money" now
I wish theory o' s existed
Matpat ruining your childhood from 2011
I dout this alot can you sop ruining pokemon
Oh no
Me liking the video matpad BUT ITS JUST A THEORY A FILM THEORY
MatPat: shows gabite when talking about garchomp Me: Da Fu--
I personally would have to assume, (because hey, Pokemon often started with Japanese Culture), a lot of the meat would actually come from fish Pokemon of various types for most people. Think about it, almost all fish Pokemon are water types alone meaning in theory you could easily hatch and/or raised multiple at a time (one the common types in all Pokemon regions), and they'd be multiple ways to cook them (so sushi, fried, baked, in casseroles, etc.).  I also feel like most of them also just look tasty by default.
Anybody notice at 3:54 it says “ why do we USE USE specific animals for food”
Use use
Weebs : *is this a American joke I’m too European to understand *
ik im commenting alot but why did you say mukrow? its murkrow
mattpat btw the "pidgey clones" are mostly referred to as regional birds by the community. Spearow is an exception however since its mostly a side bird in gen 1
"like dragonite tyrantrum and *garchomp*" /proceeds to show a gabite/
You should make a video on the truth of the mcdonalds coffee court case
I want some fried torchic now
Magikarp is yummy
Magi kart is tunmy
Pat, just look at the farm in Alola. It has Miltanks, Tauros's and Mudbrays.
YO food theory now has 69 vids!!
Your a monster matpat u are ruining people's child hood and I literally have detective pikachu plush
Matpad: I like Pokémon Random guy: me to Matpad: eats a Pokémon  Random guy: WHAT THE WHYYYYY
MattPat... you need to pay for my therapy for this one... if anyone needs me I'll be hugging my wooloo
Ok, but about insects? Many parts of the world already have an insect diet, since they reproduce really fast.
I ate my dog, now what?
I wanna be the very best, so i’m gonna eat them ALL :)
Nurse Joy is the tastiest pokemon
Finally my favorite pokemon skiddo gets some attention!
makes sense!
slow poke tail is gross
I just want to know if anyone else notice that at 7:37, he used the final form dragonite and tyranitar but he used gabite instead of garchomp
Do a vegan pokemon eating
Hoothoot would not be a good way to go. As an owl, theory tells us they would eat other animals, which you would also have to breed.
Do a theory on squid games??
I'd imagine Mudbray meat wouldn't taste that good since they're part ground.
Eating a Nurse Joy? Please, we have a more refined word for it. We are simply together with a Nurse Joy and indulge in relations.
Matpat : nurse joy is a pokemon Also matpat : you should eat pokemon  Me : dont mind if i do
Ok Matpat, in Game Theory you explain the Pokémon theory that Pokémon are humans. In here you’re explaining how Pokémon are eaten. You’re telling me the Pokémon verse is just about cannibalism???
Food theory: Hamster mum's eat their children
69th video wow
matpat: saying something i dont need to know : me : i just wanna know if i can eat a bulbasour in a salad
I haven't seen the Game Theory video, but I wouldn't mind eating Nurse Joy.
Id like to eat nurse joy....😉
How long could u Survive in a gas staion?
pretty sure they eat humans
I'm so hungry right now
This is a lie. Do something like that thing in finding Nemo. Pokemon are friends. Not food.
Oh wow! I'd love to sink my teeth in a donk! I wonder what good sauces would be for it <3
also i thought he was gonna do it for every region hmph

Why is that a granite instead of a garchomp, which is what he says?
I wonder what a cooked Groudon taste like
HEY matpat , I have a theory for you,. You should test if the same item in a store is the same quality in other stores. I feel like family dollar and Walmart have waaaaay different tastes in quality.  Love the vids ❤❤
but why would I eat my shiny charizard?
Mandjtv did it mikey did it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnO1_wMS_AE&t=343s like four years ago man
me realizing that he said garchomp but the editors put in gabite
ive been thinking about this for years!!! now like ive been thinking do poeple hunt pokemon with other pokemon like there ridng on a { any horse type pokemon ] while having[ dog based pokemon ] chasing something fight it with both of them and then gut it and bring it back home and have barbeque [ any pokemon] ribs like wouldnt that be weird but a realistic thing to witness right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHfryzALl-s MATTPAT EXPLAIN
Snorlax Bacon... Mmmmm
"HELLO THERE!"
Man... I love you MatPat, but this video just reminded me how bad you are at pronunciation. idk if it's still available but there used to be a 3D pokedex for the 3DS that at least had all the Pokémon up to gen 5. Maybe listen to that 🤣
Not the applin!!
Can you do a theory about The Owl House? If you do, Ill be very happy! Thanks!
**That vegan teacher is typing…**
Hey food Theory can you please make a video about E339 / Trisodium Phosphate And see if it’s REALLY THAT BAD for you-and I mean in the sense of it being in food and not E339 by itself- and if there’s any way of not having it in other foods without the food tasting like it has no flavor- if that makes any sense 😅😅😅  Sorry if this is a stupid question / request
.69 nice😎
They've shown he can bee milked - MatPat 2021
Metagross is not a legendary
the legendary pokemon mega metagross
Do my singing monster theory
5yo when the see the thumbnail:I CAN EAT MY POMEMON CARDS?
たもも
7:39  Did… did they put Gabite instead of Garchomp? 🙃
The number one type you don't want to eat is poison types because you will most likely die from it.
I was going to ask about the fish option but I can see that so many people beat me to the question. So many like minded individuals
Since hoothoot are practically owls, shouldn't it mostly be thick heavy down and a heavy leg, thus taking a lot of meat weight away
So essentially this is eating in France.
Dislikes from this videos are from vegans
...Brocks got some explaining to do for his stews...
MAT! DO A THEORY ON LITTLE LAD PLEASE HE HAS LORE! I KNOW THIS SOUNDS DUMB BUT LIKE . PLEAEE
Idea*(I don't think this is an Idea) why don't some people don't like candy corn
7:34  …that’s not a Garchomp. That’s its middle stage, Gabite. Close, but not quite.
Ho oh can’t fit inside any non industrial seized ovens
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOÒOOOOOOOOOÒOOOOÒOOOOOOOOOOOOÒOOOOOÒOOÒOOOOO
Aww, I was thinking Doduo as a bird pokemon to choose from.
What happens when you put kraby inside a pressure cooker?
MatPat brought a new meaning to “Gotta Catch em all.” Maybe they will get fried in the Poke-ball, too.
Can tapu koko fit inside the average sized oven
Me remembering Nurse Joy is a Pokémon: 😏 *what are we talking about?*
What happens when you microwave furret
What happens when you microwave pikachu
Um, things that felt "off " 1.Pokemon unite image you used 2. you used gabite instead of garchomp 3. you used a Pokemon go incubator Im not tryna be annoying but it threw me off and I just wanted to ask anyone else if it felt like that for them too?
magikarp were cooked and kabobbed in gen 1 and 2 anime
This man is on a whole new level of understanding
Oh my the game boy intro was beautiful
Wow yes yum
Yay
lol he but gabite instead of garchomp
69 videos nioce
I guess I'm eating nurse joy
“and garchomp” pulls up a picture of gabite lol
7:32 “garchomp”
Imagine if that vegan teacher saw this
Is Venusaur a plant or an animal
ive got a luuger and a dream
1) I'd want a Pokemon farming sim 2) are you just learning Wailord's size is nonsense? The thing is less dense than air according to math and science. It's the float whale for a reason, I guess...
Nooooooooooooooooooo
4Kids made that same theory in the Pokémon 3 movie commentary they asked a lot of questions about how things work in the Pokémon world
Oh god, this makes me sick, I'm going vegan... FML
Garchomp? Matpat did you mean garbite? Or did your editors forget what he looked like .... ITS OK WE STILL LOVE THE THEORISTS AND YOU MATPAT *THE NEXT JEOPARDY HOST*
I remember there was a part of an episode where Ash and his friends where thinking about eating a Magicarp.
So eating nurse joy isn't cannibalism?
That's such an amusing thumbnail, for some reason.
Suggestions :Yall should figure out what kind of gum flavor/brand sustains the taste of it the longest
I had a theory about this a while back, I'm glad you covered it!
Don't people already?
7:36 That's a gabite my guy
Gotta eat them all.
Something matpat didn't consider is taste. Hoothoot would likely taste nasty because predator meat tastes more bitter. Hoothoot is definitely a bigger predator than the other bird pokemon. The ability to level and grow a pokemon really only matters if you intend to evolve it. You can absolutely selectively breed a tastier bird like Pidgey to get as much meat as Hoothoot and it won't taste bitter.
Gen 5 explosion protect double battles farm industry. ( 16 k exp for 1 battle ). $$ ) RAISED! People don't like pigeon meat for the same reason the masses don't like duck meat. They are filthy animals. They spend too much of their lives getting dirty. That's why your grocery store doesn't even sell pigeon or duck meat. People don't like dirty meat, so Mudsdale is a bust. However, deep sea fishing isn't the way to wailord meat. Just keep it a Wailmer at 286.6 pounds in the hatchery right out of an egg.
The best Pokémon to eat is gardavor
Hey mat, do you hate yourself? If yes figure out how many water bottles can fit into the average Walmart or anything else
69th Video of the channel!      Nice.
Ah yes lobster and crab my favorite plants
Do Pokémon eat other Pokémon‘s because they are Pokémon food but The question I have here is what is Pokémon food for Pokémon made hours depending on the products in the Pokémon food they’re in their cells cannibalism
Jokes on you it's been established that leveling up/evolving is different than aging so..... wrong
Hopefully the vegan teacher doesn't try taking down this vid
You should feed the rise about “Cooking Companions” there are some great lore ;3 🥬🍓🥔🍞🧅
waaiiit a second! thats no garchomp! 7:36
I watch all 3 channels lol
Can't wait till that vegan teacher does a video on this
Let’s go Brandon!
Hoot hoot would be a carnivore making for less desirable meat no?
I'm sorry but that's a gabite not a garchomp
Mat pat I love ur vids but that's kinda dark
This is an awesome theory! I love the thought that went into it. I would really love as well to see a follow up theory taking into account different regional diets since the pokemon seen here just aren't all common in the same region. More than one region for instance is based on Japan and might have a much more seafood-based diet.  I also think there's two small things you forgot to take into account. Hoothoot, based on an owl, it is most likely a carnivore. Carnivores are a lot more expensive to maintain than an animal you can feed grain. I think by that logic either Spearow or Pikipek is your poultry bird! I also think that with Mudsdale being a steel type, a lot of its weight is going to come from inedible parts. Mudbray though... I think you're onto something if the islands of Alola can sustain Mudbray farms enough to feed its population.
go vegan
The Sinnoh Games (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum) had this one book in the library that confirmed that the people ate water pokemon at least.  I went and looked it up : "Pick clean the bones of Pokémon caught in the sea or stream. Thank them for the meals they provide, and pick their bones clean....." So things like  Remoraid, Barboach, Whiscash and more. But then the Sinnoh myths were kind of crazy... in a good way.
Oh I’ll eat nurse joy any day-
Pretty sure you cant eat pokemon
My Pokemon comic has Krabb Sushi in it :p.
"I'm sorry little one"
Owls are carnivores and thus extremely inefficient for farming because price of food
7:34 But thats a gabite, not garchomp
just now realizing oak could have eaten his grandsons Pokémon
“And Garchomp” *shows a picture of Gabite*
My theory: In the Pokémon center Ash ate meatballs, so its passable, That the Pokémon they in the Pokémon center died… get ate
MatPat:you should eat your pokemon Also MatPat:Nurse joy is a pokemon
But… there are milktank farms… like, múltiple around different regions…
Honestly I don't think I'd like to eat donkey and owl meat regulary
I want to eat an alolan ninetails IT WILL TASTE SO COLD AND AMAZNG IN THE SUMMER
Brook would totally eat some nurse joy
We also eat those animals because they're easily domesticated. Cheapness Depends on how you raise them. In America you still have battery farming which is cheap but horrible.
Oh yeah, shuckle!
11:03 ok, does Mat just sang the Pokemon rap?
Save some applin and Eevee okay!!!!!
I don't think we can eat Poison-type Pokemon. Also, in the original Gold version of the game, the players mom references making Cinnabar Burgers. Which is suppose to be made out of Miltank meat. It's been referenced that Pokemon are also food. It's probably why some are raised more for food and others for battle.
so we should eat pokemon... and nurse joy is a pokemon?... i can see where this is going..
Literally wanted to know and matpat literally just says one of my topic in school
What's the probability that hoothoot isn't heavy as meat but as heavy in bone density?
"I need nourishment! Tauros meat!"
Watching this reminded me of the Palworld trailer. I can't wait for that game to come out
You will never catch me eating my Mudsdale 🥺🥺
Nothing like a delicious pika stew
Hmmmm Pikachu good     And thx for ruining my bad chulrhood more lmao
Tonight I dine on squirtle soup
But hey that’s just a Film  theory?
Hey guys imagine the vegan teacher watching this and making a reaction video…. Just imagine 🤣😩
Don't tell the vegan teacher about this
But what about fish?
My only issue with this theory is that it shouldn't matter the 'growth time,' unless you need an evolution for food.  But hatch time is the end all be all here.  Basically, in the pokemon world, there is no real physical differences with level/age (weight, height, extra; not XP and IVs) between a lvl 1 pokemon and a lvl 100 pokemon of the same type.  So, in that regard, miltank would be vastly superior to gogoat because he is ready to go to market after hatching where as gogoat needs to wait level 32.  And for milking, even if you need the move 'milk drink' for milking these pokemon, miltank learns it much quicker then its goat counterparts; so it still would be better to have a miltank.  So in all regards miltank>Gogoat
I remember trying to calculate how many shuckle it would take to make just a gallon of berry juice. I remember trying to find the volume of tea cup because thats about how much juice it showed being poured out of a shuckle shell in the anime. I lost the answer but I remember that in order to make a living off of shuckle, you'd need A LOT.
Flame body can lower hatch time so numel could be an efficient farm option. Also we should consider taste with the meats since there's a chance ground types taste "earthy".
MATPAT. Weight isn't everything. With the size of that donkey and it's weight, it's meat most likely has density of steel. I would like to see you eat that.
The "Food Theory" is game boy font/effects was worth the whole video. The nostalgia.
Weiiird
me at the begin of the video: but can you eat nurse joy than?
Not sure it was considered that Mudbray and Mudsdale are coated in mud, for Mudbray it's wet mub around its feet and for Mudsdale it's hardened into hooves. Top that with the fact that the mud is so intrinsic to each that it's practically part of its body and I think it might be safe to say that their weights are skewed because of the very mud they have attached to their bodies. Now i know the assumption might be to just "wash it off" but considering that it's canonically stated that a Mudbray without mud is very uncomfortable and irritated or that Mudsdale's mud hardens to be harder than stone it might just not be practical to remove it for weight purposes. Certainly not in Mudsdale's case, having to jackhammer stone off a horse just to weight it? Not to mention that weight adds to it's kicks. Kicks which are stated to be able to scrap a truck. Further, consider that Mudsdale is said to be able to pull a 10 ton load. Honestly, I just don't think they'd make good eating. Mudbray is probably a lot lighter in terms of actual meat content, while Mudsdale is probably not just way lighter but also incredibly lean. The muscle it's stated to be able to use would paint a picture of an animal so strong that it's meat would be incredibly tough and hard to eat. But ofc, these are just my thoughts....... MMMMMM Hoothoot meat.~
Remembering reading it in one of the games....
My father has been wanting to eat Pokemon for a long time thanks for the theory
O-O
If Pokémon were real they wouldn’t even be called pokemons, just animals, and it’s common sense that we eat animals so I believe this should come surprise to nobody
A video to compliment this one should focus on the myriad of Pokemon that would and could eat humans.   Seeing as Pokemon have such a huge advantage over us, it would be the likely thing to happen and difficult for us to resist. Their world is possibly based on a philosophy of "you don't try to me, we won't have to eat you."
Technically this is a game theory food theory and a film theory video
Thinking about eating Nurse Joy 😏
Eat your vegetables i mean pokemon
I don't agree with the idea that most vegetarians are veg because they don't want to feel the guilt of killing animals. I think Mat has that confused with vegans. Vegetarians are usually so because of traditions and heritage. The regions they lived in just provided more viable food options in plants and that was passed down from generations. Another reason is religion which is also related to heritage.  It is very much possible that in the Pokemon World, certain plant based Pokemon are farmed like any other plant because they are viable options for nutrition and taste.
What about bug meat?
Pokemon trainers:We never abuse Pokémon                                                                                                                                                                                    Also Pokémon trainers:
Oh my goodness this video is the 69 th video
How do you not get that skiddo is prounced like kiddo? Young goats are "kids" skidoo is a snowmobile brand
finally gamefilmfood theory
Guys why did my Alcremie run away after looking at my PC?!
He says Garchomp But show a picture of Gabite
Alcremie lookin' kinda edible ngl...
69 videos nice
I have an theory idea: do something with cookie run and cookie run kingdom! These games are full of sweets and food puns!
I was going to make a joke about how you can eat nurse Joy, but I thought that wouldn't be family friendly content.... Then you just do it, like at the end. I'm at a loss for words lol.
PETA is going for a man hunt against you for this XD
hey matpat you should make shorter theories on your community tab
"We could all end up eating Nurse Joy" don't threaten me with a good time
The phrase "that's just a theory" is such a weak mind set
too bad,i would never do that
To be honest, the anime has many fishers, i think water-type pokemon were eaten the most.
Why there is no video yet about how to successfully predict the number of jelly beans in a jar so I can finally win that carnival game.
Says garchomp, shows gabite. Literally unwatchable
Wait so you can eat nurse Joy
Hey mat pat I've been curious I have a trip coming up and that sparked my interest how long could you survive in an airport  I thought food theory was the best place to ask
day 24 of asking matpat for a slenderman theory
why did you have to make the milktank squirt the milk that's just very "sus" as the kids say it
Bro what
Will eating a Pokèmon grant me abilitys?
Random fact: Applin isn’t an apple. Applin is a worm inside an apple
The thumbnail is actually very cursed
U know what bc I like 1% milk so milk poki is a great choice
the way matpat says pokemon names/regions/towns makes me so upset, he even said mukrow thats how my mom says it
hi
Ewww no i wouldn't eat my pokemon
this is why i hate carnists.
for the algorithm
But why do u eat it just don't
Nooooooooo stop  plsssss i beg u don't eat them
I kind of want a follow up of someone going through all the sensible Pokémon in this "Should you farm it" fashion
This man has ascended into godship
Is eating them the reason wild encounters are hostile?
Me looking at Pikachu ice cream: *too sed to eat it*
i love how he mentions garchomp but it's a gabite
Oh my, the animals of this world are "Pokemons" You even get milk from their own version of Cows.
Pikachu: what the he-
I just want to point out he made a theory calling nurse Joy a Pokémon
Correction: shuckle makes the drink which are then extracted from their bodies, as shown in anime
Dragonite,tyranitar, garchomp..? That's gabite my dude
Trust Mat-pat and his team to miss the fact that lack of bio diversity in human diets is a relativity new and modern thing; and just pretend that it some sort of normal behavior to should be mapped onto fictional worlds without the same socioeconomic situations.
8:52 Pokémon do evolve on their own you just don't see it that often take primeape for example it evolves from a  mankey just because it's angry
6:29
Can you eat Pikachu
except for vegans
That Gameboy advance style food theory title just hit me with so much nostalgia.
Gabite*
Think shiny Pokémon would be sold for a much higher price and would be a delicacy people eat shiny Pokémon
9:54 I don't get it
you show a picture of gabite and call it garchomp at one point, editor mistake.
This almost makes me want to go vegetarian in real life. Imagining my meats as Pokemon just crushes my soul ...
It's not that odd if you think about it It's like comparing a dog to a fish you know
Pokémon "farm simulator" is actually not a bad idea I mean a crossover between pokémon and harvest moon...
I haven't started this video but I can already tell many many poison Pokemon aren't edible, with the few exceptions being ones that have real life equivalents that are eaten despite having venom like Quilfish and Arbok.  EDIT: Poison never even brought up. Oh well.
No wonder Farfetch was nearly hunted to near extinction.  Imagine if ducks just walked around with their own side ingredients. The dude is like _"I tastes best with some green onion."_
Anyone craving Kentucky Fried Combusken?
Big oooffff at 07.36
I love these theories
Ground types probably don't taste great
do a seafood edition
Mmmmmm yummy Bronzor 🤤
uHhHhHHHhHH
this is literally a game theory
there are a few problems with ur theory, people don't tend to eat owls or donkeys for the most part so I think you need to go back to the drawing board and try thigger out a pokemon to the real world counter part.
Awkward silence. . .  Wasn’t this made right afterwards or the same time the Nurse Joy Video was? Kinda sus
If people would eat plant/flower pokémons, would they be considered vegans or not?
One word “OW”
"Pikachu, I choose you!"
Vietnamese Food Theory: 'Hello, my name is MatPat. Welcome to ELF WORLD!'
Well they make curry and in the Pokémon sheild game you can cook herbs and other items for curry and other foods
I think by eating Nurse Joy, you should gain 100% of your health, just saying.
I can barley carry 11 kg and your saying hoot hoot is 21.2 kg ?!!?!.😯😦😯 😦😐
11:12 "MUKrow"... Apparently MatPat ate the R in Murkrow
I occasionally enjoy a tauros steak garnished with an oddish. There is a pidgeot wing shortage right now so ive been eating pidgy nuggets.
That Gameboy intro tho
Yea I would be more happy to eat veggies that are all around the Pokemon world rather then a walking bellsprout or a tangela 😂😂😂
WHAT NO DON'T EAT YOUR POKEMON!
I think you confused Taillow and Hoothoot on the level up groups. Tallow levels up so fast and Hoothoot just...drags
I saw a tiktok of a Pokemon being cut up and served as soup.
wait so pokemons are now paimon?
That vegan teacher left the chat....
I knew Bulbasaur can be used as a cabbage
BETTER WATCH OUT MATPAT NICOLA COMING
matpat: “like tyranitar, dragonite and garchomp” *shows gabite* i’m onto your lie, buddy
The issue with Mudsdale and Mudbray is that they're covered in thick layers of dried mud. Their weight isn't so much meat, but mud and dirt.
Imma eat Joy... In both ways
“Garchomp”
Guess I'll be Chinese with all my Eevees
Applin isn't the apple, it's the work. And they aren't attatched. Wailord is a whale blimp. The thing is probably mostly air. Mudsdale and mudbray are ground types. Which means parts of them are more likely to be akind to stone, and dirt. And probably taste nasty.
Alright, I like your choices, but you mentioned something early that you then kinda ignored later, and that was what resources are readily available, so you may have selected the best overall choices but you didn't go region by region and determine how much effort it is to raise verses the labor cost for the region, as well as what the region has available to it in terms of local livestock.
What about fish? That's an entire other food group. Fishing and fish hatcheries are a thing. Plus, Magikarp, and likey others are probably very easy to hatch/raise.
14:40 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Don't be sad about eating pokemon, you're just increasing the ghost type population
Wait, since pokemon are "human", does that means we're cannibal?
Pika - Chew!
This was such an interesting episode
I haven’t watched this channel in a while and this was a weird vid to come back to
mat pat one of miltanks enter says if you drink to much you will turn into a miltank
So, can anyone in the pokemon world truly be a vegetarian or vegan since a lot of plants and fruits are alive too
I was enjoying the farming lesson. Completely forgot what this video was about
14:40 "We could end up eating Nurse Joy" Well... if you insist ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I feel like this guy sometimes try to ruins people childhood
There is othe ways people eat.they need to be vegan and eat berri to survive if they dont wanna harm pokemon.
Me still waiting for the rest of Omega Mart: 👁👄👁
I would keep watching but I have to go right away, I have some fresh magikarp sushi waiting for me
I will not watch this video, but this thumbnail scarred for me for the rest of my, now pitiful, life.
So is this food theory or game theory?
One thing to consider with miltank vs skidoo is miltank is always female, so 100% of the miltank eggs your daycare produces will be able to produce delicious milk while only 50% of skidoo eggs will hatch females. With cows this isn’t a problem because the males can become delicious meat, but skidoo is a grass type Pokémon and grass types probably occupy that awkward middle area where they aren’t meat and non-Pokémon plants are much easier to justify eating. There’s also the question of what conditions are required to produce milk, IRL a cow has to have a baby to produce milk, but the Pokémon world implies miltank are more like farming sim cows in that they produce milk constantly. By contrast the presence of baby skidoo suggests skidoo have to have had offspring recently in order to produce milk. Anyone who’s played the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons series will be able to tell you cows that produce milk constantly without breeding are much more efficient than cows that have to be bred periodically to continue producing milk. That series only tried making cows realistic once.   Also the Pokémon world has a strong regional cuisine culture dependent on whatever the native Pokémon are, so while hoothoot might be the fowl of choice for Johto Kanto is more likely to go with pidgey or spearow.
Food theory idea how do chocolate 3d printers work.
7:35 you put gabite instead of garchomp lmao
How did I get here?
I disagree. While Hoothoot may have more meat, Pidgey is more common. I think it would work similarly to when pigeons were more prevalent in the 1800s. People hunted them to extinction, but there may be laws in effect that prevent that from happening to Pidgey.
If you ever played Pokémon sword and caught a barrasweda I think it’s called it’s dex entry on the end says “ though it’s meat is surprisingly tasty” and I’m like ewww
Farming animals is only "profitable" because of the crazy amount of money the U.S government gives to farmers in the form of subsidies. Take that away and farmers would either be in the red or beef would cost roughly $35 to break even. Considering the amount of overhead cost, raising the animals for a few months to a few years to be big enough to produce meat with the amount of grain and water, general labor, and unforeseen costs (animals dying early, cost of grain increasing etc.) the math of producing  $0.97 per/lb for chicken, $1.69 per/lb for pork, and $1.64 is just not realistic if subsidies are not taken into consideration. Also very disingenuous to say we have a lot of land and water when we are literally going through continue water shortages in many parts of the U.S as well as outsourcing our farming to other country due to a shortage of land that can act as pasture from over farming. I love your channels MatPat but the due diligence on this video was just not done. Using one farmer as a source to base most of the info while ignoring the concept of subsidies is not going to cut it.
9:56 I dont get it
12:00 Though the weight would indicate this is a good source of meat. I feel like the Ton of feathers situation. If you have ever seen a Owl, its alll feathers. Then again this is Pokémon so maybe its just a tasty large chicken wing. I just wanted to point out it could be a pillow your eating in the end thats all.
If Pokemon are the only things on the planet right doesn't that mean the humans are Pokemon just more evolved
What about sea food
This is hilarious
I'm pretty sure they eat poke-eggs too, isn't there that one episode where team rocket takes care of an egg then James would offer the egg some scrambled eggs then Meowth hits him with a pan getting mad at him.. Or is there a Pokemon that I'm unaware of that lays normal eggs? Do normal eggs even exist?? My mind is twisting
Matpat says Garchomp while showing a Gabite
Why u use meta Ross as an legendary
i would buy STACKS of theory o's
14:39 ....so he IS thinking about it
The mudbray/mudsdale one doesn’t totally make sense to me. Couldn’t the huge spike in weight be from muscle rather than meat? And wouldn’t that make it less efficient if the meat is too tough to eat?
matpats favorite move, make a ridiculous claim at the beginning, spend way too long explaining the actual thing he is going to do, then answer it and end it with a ego boosting self made catchphrase.
Magicarp would probably taste pretty good
The gachomp you used is not the last evo
But I need to know... what are the Pokémon you shouldn't eat?
too...much...math..brain hurt..!
mmm fresh meat
I think at the end when you said it tastes like chicken you meant to say hoot hoot instead of mudbray
I think I’m weird cuz I thought that the intro was higher pitch so I went to earlier episodes but nope guess I’m crazy
After watching those two videos, I have a  question would killing and eating nurse Joy be murder and cannibalism?
just waiting for bdg to be summoned from the depths and respond
Foie gras is so good! When ethically produced and not forced I absolutely am willing to put up my hard earned cash for it. It can literally bring so much flavor to a plate that I have sold individual portions for close to 50$ usd and I'm talking foie gras 3oz maybe and a 6oz steak topped with a very succulent demiglas paired with a simple veggie like asparagus and petite heirloom carrots cooked in butter and herbs and a few fingerling potatoes split length wise and blanched and seared hard for texture and seasoned with salt pepper and herbs like. As a chef I love food and creativity is where I thrive. I love to make food a memorable experience so much that you forget you're eating and only thing about how simple bit elegant ingredients can be prepared. It's hard to explain sometimes but I assure you the dish I'm envisioning rn would put you through a euphoric high or flavor texture and technique.
Several times in the anime, it was implied some Pokémon eat other Pokémon. First episode, Pikachu was getting eaten alive by Spearow (if this sounds cruel, you’ve never seen nature documentaries) which is why Pikachu was in such bad shape. The Spearow tried to eat Charmander as well. The group tried to eat a Magikarp. A Fearow in the Johto region tried to make a Pidgey and a Pichu into lunch. Also when Piplup was caught in Ariados’ web, I am very sure it wanted to eat him as spiders will sometimes eat small animals. I am very sure also the carnivorous Pokemon don’t just live on berries.
But if the weight of mudbray is so big compared to its size so small, it means that his meat must be very tough, right? the quality of the food matters too. Also, if the cheapest meat to grow were from humanoid pokemons like lucario or gardevoir, I don't think people would like to eat it, just like why most of us don't eat bugs, being so cheap and a really good source of protein.
this game exists. just dont play it unless your okay with animal abuse
What if you eat your Pokémon and then gain their power
Which is the Pokémon Region equivalent to China, they definitively eat Meouths and Growliths 😳
Where's my pokemon food pyramid.
I mean they don’t have normal animals it’s obvious they HAD to eat pokemon
so you should eat nurse joy?
As much as I like Food and Film Theory, there's just nothing you can do to make Pokemon interesting.
Anyone else annoyed that he said Garchomp when showing Gabite?
I mean... I don't think Mudsdale weighs that much because of its meat lol.
You know what has a higher caloric efficiency than all of those animal products? Plants, and I'm not talking about grass type Pokémon. In the Pokemon world, there are at least 64 types of berries that are used to heal your Pokémon and make poffins and Pokéblocks. In Sword and Shield, there are also plant-based curry ingredients like bread, pasta, instant noodles, tin of beans, mixed mushrooms, pack of potatoes, salad mix, spice mix, pungent root, coconut milk, large leek, fancy apple, and fruit bunch. I'd be interested to see what the most efficient vegan/plant-based foods in the Pokémon world would be. For the berries, we could consider time it takes to grow the plant, the yield (how many berries the plant produces), and how useful the berries are.
I don't understand a word you just said
@7:36 you say garchomp but that's a gabite
who wants Kanto Fire-type Chicken
The vegan teacher watching this rn
I’ll take the Farfecth’d l’orange
You have to take in account taste which we don't know till we taste it but what about how many bones are how thick the bones are in the animal? I think can be life the donkey has very wide strong bones so a lot of its weight might be bone so maybe it's not the best choice
I already knew this and had been looked down upon for executing upon this knowledge. I expect apologies from all the Pokemon rights activists who have wronged me thus far.
I have never thought i would see a matpat video with all three catergories, Film, Food, and Game theory.
I can see the title card scaring many children for years to come
nha nurse joy takes too long to grow up for the amount of meat you get. ;)
I have never watched the Pokemon anime nor have I ever played the game. Why am I here?
I like to eat my gardevoir. Gives her a lot of XP.
funny how mat says he ran out of poke theory's then makes more this year.
If you eat pikachu your eating an electric rat
On the contrary, indulging in cannibalism could solve poverty, overpopulation, and world hunger. So I’ll do that instead.
Gabite
Starley looks the most edible out of the pidgey clones, I'd buy staraptor meat as a delicacy!
7:33 lol that’s a Gabite (Garchomp’s pre-evolution) not being rude though
No they eat normal food sometimes berries
Yow matpat you should've factored in the fact that not all of the weight of the pokemon is meat. Some can be some inedible that can add to it's weight.
bro you don't have to  eat the fucking applin it's not the apple
The vegan teacher is screaming
I want theory about miitopia grub
Magikarp would be good to eat  Fish specifically salmon are really healthy and magikarp are common/easy to hatch
2:24 I thought he was going to say scientists estimate that more than 4,000  Pokémon are editable
Pokemon are Self-aware, Sentient being who can understand Human...And Human are eating them?? What if they start doing the same...to Human? #PokemonLivesMatter
Reject pig consumption, accept the chicken
Wow! Galarian theorists!
but gigantamax outweighs mudstale unless people are stupid
Food theory idea: Does treating cows with luxury REALLY make your meat taste better?
I get all my meat from chicken nuggets
So no won gonna talk about that garchomp?
7:35 but that's a gabite.
you saying garchomp then showing a picture of gabite really triggered me
At the end of every episode of the show instead of saying “ WHoSe thAT POkeMon!?” It would say “ EAt THaT POKÉmoN!!”
Let's be honest, some Pokémon would honestly taste delicious.
What
I want vegan teachers reaction to this.
imagine getting plants for dinner and you get razor leafed by a Bellsprout 😭
Mat pat on game theory: pokemon and humans are the same! mat pat on food theory: can you eat pokemon?
I would imagine magic carp would be a cheap fish to eat because it useless unless eaten or evolved
How about a theory that you can lose weight by eating subways (famous Jared losing weight by eating only them)
Oh my gosh. This man is butchering the names of a few of the bird Pokémon.
*starts screaming*
There's more to the Pokémon world: -Applin is the worm. Not the apple. -Appletun is a dragon type, so it can easily shed the apple pie parts of it's own skin. -Pokémon like Slowpoke and Crabrawler actually have edible peices of their bodies, but they can actually grow back (both of which are fine to eat). -Some Pokémon actually carry food as part of their design (The Happiny line, Snover (it's body can grow berries), etc.) -Real life animals still exist in the Pokémon world. In a book by one of the creators of Pokémon, it states that Pokémon just appeared in the world out of nowhere. It's entirely possible to get your protein without eating a Pokémon. I'm not PETA, but there are ways to get around it.
Soooo....i got trauma from this.....eat your childhood.....noooope not me.
Thats gabite not garchomp
What about Bug types?
Me: *looks at Cyndaquil* Cyndaquil: *looks scared* Me: your nickname is now, Dinner.
you know you showed Gabite when you said Garchomp
I would definitely eat Goldeen
So not considering the bug-type diet? XD
Why did you choose fish as the thing people don’t eat
Tying in to your other Pokémon video on Game Theory, a Pokémon I would eat is Nurse Joy
While the results were interesting and made sense, I feel you overlooked a small fact. Mudbray and Mudsdale's weights are largely due to part of their mass consisting of hardened compacted mud, which probably isn't nutritious. One you remove that from their weight and recalculate, it may make them less efficient than some other option. Just a thought.
Brock would eat nurse joy 😏
As a Vegetariam, I felt disgusted
Honestly I feel like slowpoke tail would be a fantastic food source. We know from pokedex entries that their tails don't feel any pain, sometimes fall off naturally, and even grow back in. Not to mention that they are described as sweet tasting
Whoo milking the mom then eating the son , as a family 3:35
AREN't HUMANS POKÉMON TOO? ALSO, THE HORSE/MULE POKÉMON NEEDS THE REMOVAL OF ALL THE ROCK FLESH AS WELL AS THE NON-EDIBLE HAIR. FOR COMPLAINTS, HAIR IS HEAVIER THAN YOU MAY THINK, SPECIALLY IF IT's MADE OF SOMETHING OTHER THAN HAIR.
*uses pictures of Holstein cows when referring to beef cows*
Another b.s-Theory about Pokemon, huh?   Well, let’s give it a try and hope Matt’s Quality-Decline,  that many have noticed,  was temporary.   Later: Oh, yeah, no, this is b.s.
Pikachu looking mighty thick. 😜 LoL
I dont care you can eat your pokemon, If you hurt mudkip or wooper im coming for you
PLEASE DO A THEORY ON PALWORLD YOU CAN EAT AND ENSLAVE YOUR POKEMON
i just wanted to know what pokemon taste the best i know to much about food now
ngl pokémon farming sim would be fun
Ōk
Zero pounds of meat is my diet
What!!!!!! No way ,😭
Hello mat Pat I don't even know if you'll see this but I want you to know that your video help take away the pain of my lossed love one and I just want Ed to thank you
or game theory
um is this film theory or food theory...
Do something small to do something big
Who else got totally triggerd when he showed a dragonite, a tyranitar, and a GABITE. Not a garchomp
Regarding using FLYING pokemons as a source of meat... Wouldn't it be really hard to farm them? Chickens can't fly so it makes a lot easier to farm and ranch them... Operational costs also need to be taken into account  One could say we could use trained flying pokemon to ranch the Hoots Hoots but i have no idea about the applicability of that though
This is in general but what about for just the regions that doesn't have those Pokémon 🤔
There's a reason why a lot of people discourage eating horses though, they're not just a powerhouse when it comes to farm work, or a good form of transportation, they're also commonly used for making vaccines. Though that also brings up an interesting question, are viruses in the Pokemon universe also Pokemon?
Eat nurse Joy 😏
My biggest concern with all this is that weight is not equivalent to edible meat. Mudbray may weigh 2000 pounds but based on its size it could just be a lot of dense bones, the ones with the bigger surface area are still probably going to be good eating.
7:36 That is not Garchomp, that is Gibite. Matpat.....I'm upset..898 different poke'mon and you should know all of them.
So if I eat arcus will I'll be known as god eater
Mudbray weight is in its hooves. I don’t think that would be the quality meat yield you want. I don’t even think it would taste good? Probably tough meat.
What about commonality because I’m certain pidgey is much much more common than hoot hoot.
That Vegan Teacher:😡
What about the forgotten child, Film Theory?
They do btw. They proved there are things like: Tauros meat Miltank milk Snow cones from Ice Beam
Guys this is gonna be seen by the vegan teacher and- it’s gonna be bad
Omg 😱 that intro
so is this the first Game & Film & Food Theory episode?
7:33 *says garchomp* ... *displays gabite*
Plz nooooooooo!!
eat pokemon nurse joy is a pokemon  nice
The Game Boy Color intro was so good :)
Matpat please do a video about if milk or water is more acceptable for hot chocolate. got this idea while watching Safiay's and Tyler's Livestream.
I got a question! let's say you could shrink the planet so it could fit in your hand. If you eat the earth (whole planet) what would it taste like?
So I just lost my mind with the game boy color advanced intro.
Mr beast mystery why does he spend so much money
The Gameboy Colour intro was really cute I liked that
I'll admit, it was insane how much work and research you put into this. But there were a lot of things that you didn't consider (types, regions, movesets, how much of there weight is actually meat, etc.)
This is far more informative than I expected. I guess I'll be rasing chickens in the future.
Also the smoked poke tail ingredients in galar
I’m not going to eat pokemon
Man this guy is dumb legit y’all shouldn’t watch this
3:19 Pokemon Ranch: perhaps I exist because of tha- Game Freak: make your pokemon "happy" in your own personal pokemon farm!
excellent
what about fish/seafood?
WHO DISLIKED THIS?!?! WHOOOOO
I like how he puts a more efficient light bulb
THAT POKEMON WAS NOT GARCOMP
NO, don’t mention killing piplup
ITS KANTO NOT KONTO
Putting out "Yes you should eat your Pokemons" and "Nurse Joy is a Pokemon" one after the other was an... interesting choice?
The most Efficient Pokémon milk source is nurse joy
Kinda an old joke but- Wonder if the vegan teacher is gonna be hitting up this video too 乁( •_• )ㄏ
Ah, yes, this seems morally correct.
I’d for sure eat nurse joy👀👀
I almost forgot this was a Pokémon video when it hit the farming part
7:36 hmm yeas garchomp my favorite second evolution Pokémon
7:34 Bruh that’s a Gabite
matpat how is nurse joy a pokemon but she could breed what a human
Applin is actually the worm inside of the apple
'You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain…' – Mark Carrigan.
Then you have one guy who's just really good at Mantine Surfing, and can rare candy a Pokémon into edibility with extreme speed.
I love how happy Ash looks in the thumbnail. It makes me feel warm inside. ^^
I want my Big Mac ahgshevdhshsvsjs
6:34 i think you should take that miltank to nurse joy
In Queensland crocs wait in the water for cows on the farm to drink the water and 10%of cattle are lost to the hubby crocs
Hi
Matpat: Nurse Joy is a Pokémon  Also Matpat: Nurse joy is a civilian
You should do ' Science behind the keto diet ' video, I think that would be really cool and I personally would LOVE to get your opinion on it
Based
Wait if nurse joy is a Pokemon and you eat Pokemon then......
Brian David Gilbert was right, we shouldn't have known now I cant enjoy any video about this subject ever again
This is a game, food, &film. Theory
Miltank is already fully grown, it literally comes out of its egg at its last evolution. For example Kangaskhan hatches out of its egg with a baby in its pouch. The Pokémon world just doesn’t make any sense.
7:34 “dragonite, tyranitar, and garchomp” *shows gabite*
Those Mareeps are definitely one of the best to farm. Not only can you use their fur, milk and meat, they also generate their own electricity. Imagine if we could utilize that.
Theories from both this channel and Food Theory, but not Film Theory?! Don't worry though, bc I've got a Pokémon theory idea just for that channel: The Pokémon cannot be stopped! (This is just a title idea. You don't need to make this the actual title)    Remember a couple years ago you did a theory on Toy Story that stated that they might rise up, go to war with, and possibly even dominate humans because they are tired of being abused? Well, what if you brought that idea to Pokémon? It doesn't sound all that crazy, if you think about it; Pokémon are being abused, just like the toys in Toy Story are. They have abilities and powers that they can learn to control and use, just like the toys in Toy Story. And they can become smarter and more aware of humans' abusive natures, just like the toys in Toy Story are. But than again, that's just a theory. A Film Theory!
You guys weren't eating them before?
you should eat Pokémon and nurse Joy being a Pokémon doesn't sound right
The berries that grow on torterras back are plenty edible
It’s Skiddo, (like kiddo,) not skidoo. That was pretty annoying.
The Pokemon I would eat would be Nurse Joy
Why can't you all just eat quartz like a normal person? edit: Also, Levels aren't the same as age. You could have a level 2 Pidgey that dies of old age at 100 or a level 100 Pidgey that's still considered a child.
Could you cook fire type Pokemon meat? It is literally living in the environment you try to cook it in.
Not to mention social aceptance values, as may some pokemon be consdierd pets or versions of domesticated animals, we like in the real world would have a tendency to not eat them, As in china in certian agricultural areas, it is against the code to eat cattle because cattle or cow does way to much work as it helps transport goods, it helps with agriculture and it helps with alot more so its kinda inhumaine to eat them
Remember grub hub I just thought that if milkshake lady and taco guy  (Jimmy neutron) had a child like Jimmy neutron and the way we see taco guy it's as if we are a kid  because we are stood at head hight of the Jimmy neutron cast or chicken burger guys son chicken sandwich boy

Nindoqueen milk should be good
Love how I watched this even though I’m a vegetarian 😂
We will be able to eat our pokemon when Palworld is out lol!
I can't hear "bird pokémon" without thinking of missing no.
Give a man a joltik he will be hungry again tomorrow teach a man how to catch a snorlax he can eat for a lifetime.
You answered the question I never knew I had
The fact this is on Food Theory just... Terrifies me.
The Man has told me that some of you are not informed. Very well. Wait for the next video. Look in the comments. I will give instructions from The Man. Remember, The Man is your ally. .naM ehT tsurt t'noD .stnemmoc eht tsurt t'noD .dedavni sah naM ehT .erofeb emac tahw erongI
I already knew this. The Man told me so. The Man knows everything. The Man sees everything. Trust the man, and you will become a god.
This mans jimmy neutron in real life
I wonder if they’ll have “organic rare candy free” Pokémon meat...
Matpat using gabite for garchomp at 7:38
I've always thought the tastiest Pokémon would be god itself. C'mon people, a god that created everything didn't make itself delicious? I would certainly do.
Okay so who’s gonna ask first?? Hmm 🤔 no one… Kay me then. When are we getting actual theory-o’s ???? And yes they have to be an actual  mystery flavor in which we have to not only use taste but other forms of problem solving lore to get the answer… and of u wanna be fun about it . There can be a special box that turns the milk green ..was gonna say yellow (for food theory) but yellow looking milk would look weird o.O
Would evolution stones count towards production? It would basically be the mobile premium currency of this farming sim sense it matures your animals instantly wouldn’t it?
Owls are birds of prey, and they taste poor due to their diet
“Not eating nurse joys is KILLING your gains”
I don't care how good they are I'm not eating Torchicken nuggets. XD
For accurate tarot prediction on success and love that truly resonates,  come visit us at http://www.youtube.com/c/SuccessAndLoveTarot
Just raise competetive pokemon that are good for food so if the nature is good raise it for battle if it's bad raise it for meat like seriusly it's a working stradegy if you think abaut it like if you mess up the iv training it goes to the meat grinder ev's are wrong? To the grinder and in the end if it's a good competetive pokemon you can use it or sell it to someone if it's bad... then someone get's food on their plate it's a win win scenario just remember to raise the edible ones so no bulbasaur as it's a grass poison type but grilled charmander and squertle soup is fine but like seriusly if you raise good pokemon you can even sell some of the bad ones for non-competetive trainers of course if it get's too old meat
Mat has officially lost the plot
But is mudray made of meat or mud?
That Vegan Teacher be like:
Food theory idea: what can get you to stay up all night caffeine or sugar??
what distracted me during this video was ignoring temperament and domestication in relation to Hoothoot, and anatomy in relation to the horse Pokemon. Hoothoot come off as coy and mischievous, thus difficult to reliably farm, and you might find the horse meat to taste pretty earthy given the type and where that weight is likely going. for pokemon to withstand battle, i can't imagine their meat cuts easily or is bitten easily either.
So.... Pocket Monster Rancher?
Fun fact: miltank sucks... it's own utters also it should be hunted to extinsion
Mmmm, taste like mud
Hey aplin is a worm inside an apple not an apple
Wtf matpat
That is one awfully strange looking garchomp. Edit: 7:35
Applein isn't the Apple it's  what's inside of the Apple
This episode got me thinking. If plant Pokemon are able to move and fight like any animal Pokemon. What do their insides look like? Do they have muscles, meat, brains, ect?
Eating most pokemon is ethically wrong since they are sentient.  Only Pokemon that would be ok to eat would be ones on the intellectual level of Magikarp.  When you get to pokemon like Mr Mime, Hitmonlee, Meowth or Jynx it is almost cannibalism.
This is cool, though for your "poultry" section, you only considered flying-types, and not bird-like pokemon. I'd argue Magby's the best for that, since it's the same weight as Hoothoot, and though it takes longer to hatch initially, every Magby has a chance of having "Flame Body," which halves the 5120 to 2560 steps, making it more efficient. Since they'd all be put together in a pen, this would make all Magby's hatch faster--theoretically cutting the time down even more with every Flame Body Magby present. Sure, you'd need a Magmar to get them, since they ARE baby pokemon, but the parent wasn't considered in your analysis. Plus, being a fire type, it's probably already seasoned well.  It might not be the "traditional" poultry, but it is still bird-like. Especially since you didn't even consider the king of poultry: the Torchic line. (My argument here would be competitive battlers breeding them and releasing them anyways. Just give the rejects to the farmers. 5120 hatch steps are down to 0, and trainers will breed hundreds at a time to get a shiny, or a perfect-stat Speed Boost Torchic. Need to keep the everyday trainers in mind too, MatPat).
@7:34 that’s no garchomp. Fake fan
One thing u didn't take in to account.... is animal special uses.even if it's more valuable, in the real world we do try to have some ethics .....and with Hoot Hoot haveing a special organ, that allows them to perfectly sense the rotation of the earth, Ect....I think Hoot Hoot Would be Under Scientific protection not sure if we would be farming a animal with such unique abilities....im sure pokemon right activists wouldnt allow that to happen
All my homies eatin Togepi
Oh cool Matpat made a Pokemon episode!   ...on food theory...
You never ate ostrich, Matpat?
Is anyone going to mention Brian David Gilbert's great polygon video on this?
if that's the case, are grass type starters like snivy sutible for vegans? Not a vegan myself tho
I'd also like to see what seafood they'd be eating, like how magicarp takes only 1k steps to hatch.
Something to think about with mudsdale, is that there might be less meat, due to bones
So, people eat any sort of PokeMon. The fact that you proved in your other video on Game Theroy that Nurse Joy is a PokeMon is slightly disturbing. Edit: Okay, you went there.
Interesting
Safari Zone is an undercover abattoir? Coming soon to a MatPat video near you!
We should hunt pat and eat him to restore order to the universe
Eat an owl?...bruh, no
Loving the video (and yes, I will go watch the Nurse Joy video in a minute), but a few questions.   1) Taking into account the different generations of Pokémon, and the different landmasses they come from, what about the most popular Pokémon for meat, eggs, and dairy *per generation*?   2) Also, what about transportation costs? If all the generations existed in the same PokéWorld, it might be worth having to take into account truck/rail/boat/flight methods. This would affect why even if a Pokémon is the best overall for caloric purposes, it might not be popular in another region due to transportation costs.   3) Could this explain why we don't seem to see a lot of elderly Pokémon around? In the wild, they might get caught for eating purposes, and if you catch a young/starter Pokémon, and train it up in your battle party, you just...eat it (or let it breed and *then* eat it) once it's too old to battle effectively?  But the preference for eating young animals (i.e. lamb over sheep) due to the more tender meat and better flavours... Could that *also* explain why there's fewer (naturally) evolved Pokémon in the world? That the evolved forms are caught before they get to the point of being 'unusable'?  4) Could this be linked to your *other* video about Pokémon breeding and how a starter-Pokémon species dies out? There was some interesting math in that video about how many eggs a female could produce in a day that might shed some light on what the most abundantly-eaten Pokémon could be in each area. What about the possibility that some Pokémon (the first that comes to mind is Caterpie...for some weird, peculiar reason) could be bred and raised to serve as food for *other* Pokémon?   But hey, these are all...just theories. :D Thanks for reading!
Thank you so much https://youtu.be/4SoH_E5p2ds✅✅✅
When I watch this video all I can think about is that cursed tiktok whre there cooking Pokémon.
And if humans are Pokemon are you telling us to be cannibals ????
This is the type of unnecessary overanalysis that I love lol.
Am currently watching Pokémon XY series den this video appeared  *Bruh*
Flaw in logic: total weight does not inherently equate to how much meat one would yield. It’s very possible that the bulk of mudbray’s weight is made up of inedible components, like hooves or bones. Dense bones would be a necessity to support all that weight. That’s not even considering the caloric intake that heavy Pokémon might require too.
My goal in life from now on is for me to eat a magikarp. So I CAN BE UNSTABLE!!!!
I already "eat" my Pokémon if you know what i mean.
One problem with the mudsdale line is that the majority of the weight comes from the caked on mud
Just thinking about it a farmer trying to even put a Pokémon down for meat would probably be the most rewarding thing taking into effect on how dangerous Pokémon can be! Makes it like they came back from a big hunt maybe.
waiting on the vegans.
Frost
oh no
7:30 That's a Gabite, not a Garchomp. Also you are missing lots of points, for example why do you need to level up Pokémon in the first place? Is not like levels affects the Pokémon production capabilities, from what we know a Chansey can lay as many eggs not matter if is at level 1 or level 100.
I’d definitely eat Gardevoirs…fruits
I hope they start eating those dam pidgeys, sp irritating!!
Oh wow nurse joy being a Pokémon is only a theory not a fact
YOUTUBE STOP RECOMMENDING ME THIS VIDEO FINE I WILL WATCH IT
Certainly not for a vegan.
@thatveganteacher be like “Matpat you mentioned Meat, you get a ❌”
Matpat has taught everyone economics with just his theories. Wouldnt be surprised if there comes an episode where he teaches us how to pay taxes.
okay, one last question, for the cannibalists out there: how efficient is nurse joy's meat asking for a friend haha~~
Wait so if nurse Joy is a Pokémon (According to game theory) then you can, some would say, “eat” Nurse Joy? 🤔
And then there's Pokemon vegan
So tahts how legendary Pokemon became *legends*
Darn you game theory and your nostalgic opening from when I played with my dads gameboy in 2009
I’ll eat nurse joy 😏😏😏😏
*Looks on the menu* Pikachu I choose you!
7:35 dude that's not a garchomp tho lol
hoauss
I'm sure my little brother will like this video.
Brock would love eating nurse joy
By yeeting car bury dairy milk, you have to eat a Pokemon as well.
I want to taste Gardevoir bussy
7:37 Why is there gabite and not garchomp
Game Theory 7 years ago: "HUMANS ARE POKéMON!" Me 7 years ago: [Surprised Pikachu face.] Game Theory now: "NURSE JOY IS A POKéMON!" Me: "Am I supposed to be surprised?"
Okay, I actually want a Pokemon-branded Farm sim. Probably makes me the lowest common denominator, but I don't care. I just want it
Pokemon are animals and humans eat animals so it's kind of expected
I wonder if MatPat enjoys dumping all of this info on us? I would!
wait if nurse joy is a pokemon and he said to eat poke- you know what forget i said anything
What level counts as "mature" or "slaughter age"?
So...i should eat nurse joy out
It's sad! I am NOT going to eat my Eevee and Snorlax 😢
Welp there goes my childhood rip Charmander ☠
No, you shouldn't eat something that was once living.
Using weight as a factor for mudsdale is prob not accurate to how much food it provides because it could be made out of dirt/rocks and just be shaped like a horse
I gotta disagree with Mudsdale. Weighing that much for its size and being a ground type makes me think most of that weight is NOT meat.
Did he say the protein output for cattle was "paltry"? because I heard "poultry"
bdg did it first
It's great how much effort you put into this, it's impressive. I think I'll join team plasma and be a vegetarian though.
OMG
In other words, the efficiency for meats isn't very good and plant based diet are much more efficient lol
The ad that played before I watched this video is a pokemon ad...... I guess now I know that I can eat the pokemons I just saw in the ad, great. Just...... Great.....
*EATING NURSE JOY* YES… Brock would like to eat nurse joy 😏
Finally you covered this theory
Usually these videos don’t actually ruin my childhood. But this one…might have done it.
i want to eat nurse joy now
Mmmm yummy Pokémon
No.
*gives my eevee a water crystal*
7:32 "Dragonite, Tyranitar, and GARCHOMP"... Shows a Gabite... SMH 😭😭😭
Food theory is my favorite theory channel!
What !!!
*gasp* dont worry phantaflame id never eat you,  not that I could anyway… with your… soul burning flames… and uhhh presumably glass and metallic structure, anyway your safe from harm
Matpat wildin with dis one😭
1 Pokémon a day keeps the doctor away.
The ironic thing is One of the most common in game non catchable ranch pokemon  Is Milktank and it's probably because the difference between and Skiddo is human ethics. While Milktank is known for its heathy milk and producing 5 gallons of said milk it also needs to be milked daily or it will fall ill aka it's very morally good to raise a Milktank. But Skiddo is also known for being one of the first Pokemon to live in harmony with humans, now imagine that from a business side if you make one bad call with Skiddo your pr is going in the fucking trash.
Now that you mention edible pokemon, I wonder what pokemon serena from xy to xy&z would find delicious. God I hate myself for asking this
MY FIRST SHINY IS THE BEST BIRD FOOD SOURCE WHICH IS HOOT HOOT SOO THATS WHAT HAPPENED TO IT WHEN I LOSED IT BC A EMULATOR IN MY OTHER PHONE BROKE
Very thankful that doduo and diglett weren't part of the major food groups.
This man really just indirectly told us to #EastNurseJoy poor brock was right.
I’ve been “eating” my gardivar for a long while now
7:35 isnt that gabite?
That's a Gabite
what about the moral implications of raising an animal that has human level intelligence or greater and that animal knows you are raising it to eat it.
We all know the best milk comes from Jynx.
The explanation of why our food are most selected for our diets feels a bit simple. Some, or most, of our plants and animals are not as suitable for cultivation or farming as our current frontrunners.
I might have to disagree with the mudbray part because quite a bit of its weight might be the mud on it but discounting that it still might be the best I just think the saying wold be tastes like hoot hoot
This is good but you should be asking what Pokémon would eat waht Pokémon
Miltank...........
Theory Idea: Is it possible to spin pizza dough on your fingers like a basket ball like they do in some shows (or cooking mama), and what would be the most efficient and accurate recreation of something like that.
shouldve said ft. Game Theory
A big factor that really needs to be included as well, (though obviously can't since we can't try Pokemon meat ourselves), is the taste factor. Real animals have vastly different tastes depending on their species, as well as depending on their diets and living conditions. Fresh water and salt water fish taste very different for example. By extension it stands to reason that Pokemon would have a similar situation, but probably even more so since their elemental natures often include that element being a part of their body in some way or form. Mudsdale may taste very earthy for example, which is already a part of the reason some people don't like catfish meat in real life. While it's true that in poorer countries they would probably eat it regardless due to efficiency, other countries would likely try to replace it with something that tastes better but is still efficient, because people would be more willing to buy products that taste better so long as the price difference isn't too drastic.
Pokemon yum yum thanks mat pat
Don’t Brian from polygon unraveled quit his job because of this
Happy 69th food theory episode nice
The question is, what would taste good? Heres my Theory, by following Guido Mista's Theory, where his question was "Would humans taste good", here is his hypothesis All the meat humans eat are Herbivores, always eats vegetables and so his thought is, because Humans eat meat, we would taste horrible.
Why is it becoming normal to say "I R L" instead of "In Real Life"? Text form, I understand. Verbal... Baffles me.
Well, thanks to pokemon snap, we find out Applin does not have the Apple as part of its anatomy, its not a turtle. Its actually a worm living in the apple.
Was i the only one looking at the sword and shield pokedex and seen a pokemons dex the confirms that you eat pokemon, and its a fish(i didnt finish the video i just started it but i assume he confrimed it)
I am so catching a hoot hoot
I'm fairly sure Brock would be up for eating Nurse Joy 😏😏😏😏
Ok
So Hoot Hoot would be the main source substitute for IRL Chicken soup? Interesting. BTW- How's that video about if Chicken Soup REALLY cures you when you are sick video coming? ;)
It’s also cannon in the first season that they have cows and pigs
Magicarp is the best fish meat producer, i really want to taste Magicarp sushi
Both Mudbray and Mudsdale coat much of their bodies, particularly their hooves, in a harder than rock spit-mud mixture. Which inflates their weight. They also eat dirt and mud. Shave off all the mud, you are left with a lot less meat.
Ok whatever you do, don’t eat me. I’m too cute to be eaten
The only reality where I'd be vegan.
No, you should NOT eat your Pokémon!
Matpat.      *Calm down*
Going vegan in the Pokemon world would be absolutely funny  Just imagine the Vegan Teacher trying to wrestle a Victreebell for dinner
Opens up by saying eat Pokemon, then says nurse joy is a Pokemon, implicitly saying we should eat nurse joy, I'm down with that... Ends episode with my exact thoughts
1 Corinthians 15:1 - Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 1 Corinthians 15:2 - By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 1 Corinthians 15:4 - And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Acts 16:30 - And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be Saved? Acts 16:31 - And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy House.
Why exactly did Ash check his pokedex for the Koffing? ^^' Shouldn't he know what Pokemon it is? Especially since James from Team Rocket used to have one.
“And garchomp”  *shows gabite*
imagine if thatveganteacher saw this
Reading the comments before having finished the video, I thought they were joking about eating Nurse Joy, but no! You said it in the video, you absolute madman! 🤢🤣
no just no pokemon are not food you never see them get eaten so this isn't true
just make a google xls sheet with all the pokemon data sorted by an evaluation formula d'uh
What about Alcremie?
Use the tangela for the burger
😭
Applin are caterpiller dragons within an Apple SMH MatPat
Ihop has an ad with…  canabalizam
Always been thinking  How is ash eating eggs and bacon
mr. theorist you're drunk go home
At this point just conjoin all of the channels together this could be both food and game theory
Reminds me the time Ash and Brock thought of a Magikarp being cooked
NOW IS THE PART WHEN YOU MAKE A COLLAB WITH ROSSANA PANSINO TO MAKE A POKEMON CAKE OR COOKIE RIGET..... (I do expect results from this comment)
Gotta eat them all Pokémon!
That was Gabite not Garchomp
Garchomp? Sir I think thats a Gabite.
"And this video is sponsored by the glorious CCP!"
Mate my chaotic soul just beated my childhood soul and now thinking of suggesting a pokemon farming game that you actually see *ALL* there product
7:33 “the pre-evolved forms of rare Pokémon like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp”  *pulls up pictures of Dragonite, Tyranitar, and GABITE* 😭
Well, let's eat nurses joy!
6:57 Pikachu with a milk stache
How come the farmers care about levelling up but not evolving? Levelling up is only possible from either battling or daycare which means it can't be important to reach maturity otherwise evolution would have to. Also, most most of the time evolution is just caused by level up anyway so evolving a Pokemon might be worth it if it was better quality meat, and you can always evolve it right before slaughter if it would be too much trouble to raise it in its evolved state
Hoot-hoot would never work they only have one leg LOL
But Mudbrays meat would be super dense and hard to eat though right?!
What about fish?
7:38 Uhhhh are you sure that is a garchomp. It kinda looks like a gabite.
I'd eat a pokemon, well I would after some applied seasonings to enhance the flavor to outweigh my guilt. Prinplup on fire with a Nanab glaze, ORDER UP!
"A single Hoothoot's meat is enough to feed you and your entire family for over a week!"    *LAUGHS IN ORPHAN*
pika yum
I wanna eat gravodeir.
are you telling me to eat my mimikyu wtf
Munch mmmmmm apple
MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY MATPATS OKAY
"What would be eaten by a normal civilian" nurse joy was there and cannabalisim is not cool
Also learn how to properly pronounce pokemon names
Matpat: Fletchling, piedove Me: What? No ome has ever called pidove piedove
People 100% eat Miltank and Magikarp.
Um actually there called the "regional birds" and spirow doesn't count because he's from kanto and he only evolves once
What if some pokemon are not made out of meat? Like the donkey... way to heavy. Did you try calculating the average density of the pokemon xD what if some end up being made out of lead xD
Good bread, love the content
Why is Garchomp a Gabite
So 7:30 he lists gens 1,2, and 4 psudo-legends and says garchomp but shows a picture of Gabite
Anyone gonna mention that matpat put in gabite instead of garchomp
yes i love to eat gardervoir as…
Isn't pokemon rancher for the wii already a pokemon farming simulator
Yes EAT YOUR POKEDOG
Oh yes, Better get use to eating eggs for breakfast ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Deja vu
7:36 garchomp? that's gabite!
Oh god, it's the Animal Crossing Islander Edibility Tier List all over again
I like how you are suggesting that I eat my Pokemon that I have trained for SEVEN YEARS, just to EAT HIM IN 5 MINUTES
BERRIES!!!
there are total 69 videos on this channel as of now
me: wait.. plant pokemons exist in the show right? that means VEGAN TEACHER GIVE UP BEING A VEGAN CAUSE PLANT TYPE POKEMONS ARE LIVING THINGS
Think there were a few key points overlooked. Such as the fact that Hoothoot is an Owl and Mudbray and Mudsdale are usually covered in mud. Even though Hoothoot may weigh a lot, it’s still a bird of prey; being based on an owl. If we can eat Pokémon, then that means they eat each other too. Hoothoot would probably be more carnivorous and therefore probably have a good amount of muscle mass considering it’s built for hunting. The more muscular an animal, the less fatty meat there is to consume. This applies double to Noctowl; seeing as it becomes more nimble and designed for hunting despite being a larger bird. - Now on to the donkey horse. Mudsdale’s weight I can almost guarantee has a LOT to do with its long mane and fur being matted in both wet and dry mud. Therefore it is not technically the POKÉMON that’s weighty, it’s the load it carries with it 24/7; and we may never know how much it weighs without that slop all over it considering water would be a super effective knock-out blow to it. Mudbray however is still fairly young and has yet to develop the long locks its adult form has. Therefore it’s safe to assume that at least 95-97% of its weight is its own and not caused by outside factors. So this one still holds up for the most part, but if levels are being used to describe maturity, then we’re still eating products of Pokémon that are in their younger phases; which would be considered a delicacy as you previously stated.  An interesting topic, but I feel there are still holes in this one 🤔
im just saying that ther is a pidgey chicken farm in canon
1 full cow is like so much meat have you seen an cow head? It's so big
I would gladly eat nurse joy
ITS gabite the picture is gabite
I think the evolution idea is wrong. I'm sure the anime and manga comments that a Pokémon evolves to reach sexual maturity so there would have to be wild evolved Pokémon. Venasaur at least exists in the wild as seen in bulbasaur and the secret garden and the lake of rage has a gyarados living in it
Says Garchomp, shows Gabite, smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Don't really see any problems, since Pokemon would actually eat other Pokemon.
Obviously tauros would be eaten but someone who believes that the future of food is bugs I fear for the caterpie population
oh h*ll no
I think you missed  a crucial group of pokemon. the insect or bug pokemon as far as caloric out put you cant get better then bugs and resources to grow bugs are often 1/10 that of farm raised animals for almost 100% more yielded protien, and thats with the 1 - 3in variety of bugs we have now scale that up to pokemon size even if it makes the bugs take the same resources and time to grow the yield would still be much higher and better for you.
To be honest, hoothoot when cooked without wings would kinda just look like a big drumstick
but applin doesnt grow with the apple its just a worm that found an apple
Me maxing out my miltank to lv60 to get more beef            sToNKs
Wailmer is a Pokemon based on a balloon. Wailord as well. A huge water/air balloon simply do not weigh that much. A huge part of our diet is made of plant, fish and occasionally, insects. Perhaps a follow up video?
You didn’t mention flame body ability which lowers the amount of steps needed
Mmm mewtwo
Oh we'll be eating Nurse Joy alright ;)
Say no more, that Shiny Charizard lookin hella spicy
mMmMmMmMmMm~~~
Aright who else wants Magikarp sushi.
Am I the only one that noticed that the garchomp was actually a gabite.... It just bothered me seeing the two second stage evolutions and then gabite on the end.
Rest in Peace, Brian David Gilbert
Your messed up
Goats are delicious
When they use a gabite instead of an actual garchomp as an example sprite.. 7:34

Mat Pat Bizzare Adventure
metagross is a legendary.. yes
I see a few problems here the main one being assuming that all pokemon have the same biology or even the assumption that they're safe to consume.   The fact that you insinuated that Numel and Camerupt are edible shows that you didn't take into account that those two have literal magma inside of them. I can't even begin to understand how or why someone would farm a living volcano.  There's the fact that all pokemon hatch from eggs and also the fact that all pokemon eggs are the same size (which is hilarious considering that a Wailmer is contained in the same size egg as a Rattata). That said this means that the most efficient pokemon for eggs would be the one that eats the least and utilizes the smallest amount of space.  Edit: I also just realized that ghost pokemon that do not need to eat to sustain themselves as they're technically already dead can also lay eggs
why no fish
SEE THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOU
Did you know on tick tock there are some pokemon related food
You should have done the math on calories or found it for goats and horses as well, to show how much better it might be to cows for a food source if that part would be true.
In the words of big boss: uh-huh, but how does it taste?  Not sure a donkey that appears to be made of mud would have that great a taste matpat. Same reason some animals that are more efficient than chickens aren't widely eaten (like some insects) - some Pokémon just wouldn't be that appetising.
RUN, miltank!
4:42 *Don pastrami the ibex from                            Goat simulator Payday MY fauvorite game!*                    🐐🦩🐬🐪
*Dogs can be used as Pokémon?*
If i don't see a "This is a rat burger?" joke, im gonna be very upset
One thing that wasn't taken into consideration is how much the elemental type effects the taste of the meat. For example, mudbray and mudsdale are ground pokemon. How would this effect the taste of the meat? Even if the meat is technically edible, no one will eat it if it tastes like mud or dirt. I think this would extend to other elemental types too, especially poison, rock, steel, and bug. If the elemental types do effect how the meat tastes, then I have a feeling most people would stick to normal, flying, and maybe water and grass pokemon for their meat.
7:38 that's a Gabite!
I mean, Slowpoke's tail are edible in the pokemon, and Ash even thinks of eating Magikarp. So it's not really wrong tbh
I’ve seen a tiktok of a animation of someone cooking a pokemon
And also for the film theory do the anime adaptation lol
I am quite sure hoothoot is 90% feathers and only 10% meat. would have gone for another pokemon xD
I bet that this comment will have a random ip grabber or view grabber in the comment's comment
Come ere pikachu its dinnertime! Bring the ketchup with ya.
I can finally ear my muk
Americans are going to eat those discusting porks even if they don't make any economical efficiency and even if porks are discusting creatures.  Pigs are discusting
Iv never eat crab or lobster but I have eaten alot of sea snails periwinkles but still think the French are weird for eating snails
I should send this to a vegan
My pet owl sweating in the background lol
Thanks for ruining my childhood 😅😅😅😅
1 day ago.
If joy is a pokemon and people eat Pokemon hmmmmm ...... Ahh... Ummmmm
But what about FISH?
So if they eat a apple Pokemon do they still consider as a vegan ??
Um, maybe some of us want to know the best plant pokemon to eat... also what about fish/seafood for the pescatarians?  And maybe some others would want their protein from insect pokemon!  Also, maybe the cannibal-curious would go for pokemon like Mr. Mime and Hitmonchan...  ...is that too far?
But MatPat... What about all the arthropod based food sources? Bug types in pokemon are quite viable and often quite large as well, in addition to having both mechanically and lore-based faster growth rates than almost all equivalent strength and sized pokemon.
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
In the future can we make robots that provide meat?
But should you fu-
Eat nurse joy 😏
WATCH SUPER SIZE ME 2!!!!!!!!!! IT'S ALL ABOUT CHICKEN INDUSTRY!!!!!!!!
As a shiny hunter who has hatched literally thousands of eggs, we Shiny hunters have solved world hunger, and keep wonder trade relevant.
And it is not real Are
I wonder were he got that milk effect from                      no reason :)
Dont eat the pokemon it is poison and it is ur pet treat pokemon with kindness
No wonder there are legendary and Mythicals they must be the golden food
7:38 That's Gabite
Vegan Teacher is targeting MatPat next
I feel like mudbray is just very dense, look at how lean it is compared to the other red meat pokemon, and it's also ground type so it makes sense. And maybe each region would have different options for economic reasons, like how other region pokemon are rare in Unova or Hoenn is mostly water and would likely have more fish and birds in their diet. Part 2 for Regional differences?
OOOooooOOo I'll take some:○
Ouch My Pokemon Phase Heart is Now ruin by this theory and I love it
nurse joy is the best pokémon to eat
7:34 thats a gabite, not garchomp
OK the intro was dark
I’m not sure if eating nurse joy is cannibalism , like, she’s a human and looks like a human, but also a Pokémon.. P h i l o s a p h y
matpat: "Dragonite, tyranitar and gerchomp" shows  gabite Me: is garchomp a jock to you? Garchomp: "that's my line!"   love the Vid Tho. cheap up the good work. wonder why the mistake happened thou. o well:).
7:34 that gabite the 2nd stage not garchomp
7:32 You mean Dragonite, Tyrannitar, and *Gabite?*  You couldn't find a pic of a Garchomp?
7:35 thats a gabite.
Okay I'm at 0:28 and I wanna say that applin isn't the apple itself applin is actually a little dragon worm thing you can literally see the worm tail and not to mention you can see it's about fully grown body once it evolved into Flapple (don't ask me why Appletun turns it into a Apple pie I can't explain that either) if your not still convince that applin actual body isn't the apple then grab applin and put into a 3D Modeling software and you can actually the apple and see that applin actually looks like but there's also another way the New Pokémon Snap game where we see applin stumble over and the apple comes right off  Edit:wait when your talking about like baby forms of Pseudo Legendary Pokémon when you say Garchomp but why did Gabite show up, looks like someone *editor* didn't think us PokéFan won't notice (also I'm gonna keep editing my comment while I'm going along with the episode)  Edit 2: I'm surprised that you didn't really covered bug type Pokémon I mean eating bug's is kinda grows but real life bugs are great in protein and other stuff that I can't remember and in some Asian countries eating bug's is like eating a snack, oh yeah what happened to fish??? Like no shellfish or salmon or clamps  (And I'm find it funny that you didn't know Wailord weigh so less I mean the design is based on blimps)
Gyarados taste nice
Polygon is very disappointed right now
why
TOO FAR
magacarp
Pidgey clines are more commonly referred to as regional birds, but they are more kr less the same thing.
Who doesnt wanna eat nurse joy?!!
I'm not sure if this is the channel where you ruin our childhoods
Gameboy
hmm, thanks, i let my charmelion know it can eat the wild ratata now.
At last, the more realistic game theory, On my on opinion, if pokemon were not made for children it will be darker, like polemon was killed not fainted, and so on like yummy 🤤
So, is fitness theory a thing, or....?
Wow. That is an interesting collaboration. Matpat did make a video about Winnie the Pooh and his honey diet. Looking back, I think that could be a collaboration of Food Theory and Film Theory.   That is interesting to figure out which Pokemon would be the most viable food sources. I think the use of Pokeballs would help a lot with farming. In more modern times there are factory farms. Animals are crammed together in tight enclosed in buildings. This is a way to save on costs. Animals are cheep. Cages are expensive. So it is cost effective to stuff more animals into fewer cages. In real life, factory farms are horrifying. I feel so sorry for the poor animals. They are cramped up with no space, sunshine or fresh air. I think the Pokemon world is the one place where factory farming can work. Pokemon can go in Pokeballs, which saves a ton of space. There can be whole big buildings full of Pokeballs containing livestock. The Pokeballs would be packed tight together. It is like the Pokemon in Professor Oaks lab, except the don't get out much. A Pokemon would only be left out during meal times, so it can eat. The rest of the time, it stays in the ball. It doesn't get any excercise let alone battles. A sedentary life makes it easier to get fattened for eating. Maybe the farms can develop a way to transfer food inside a Pokeballs without getting the Pokemon out. Maybe there would also be a way to transfer waste out. People may say that this is cruel. They do have a point there. However this is a world where animal fighting is not only legal but is embraced by the culture. The animal rights ship has sailed long ago. Keeping Pokemon in Pokeballs is already a ubiquitous action. So farms can do more of that. At least the most greedy and uncaring farmers would figure out how to do factory farms for Pokemon. If Team Plasma found out, they would freak out.
7:34 garchomp ?
No way he put gabite when he said garchomp ☠
7:34 Wait a minute… thats not Garchomp
Hey what would be the best plant Pokemon to eat for holistic and medical reasons
Did you notice that all your primary fast-growing bird Pokemon were predatory Birds, might not not be the most sustainable for maximum growth of all natural non-invasive or environmentally destructive food source
The old Pokemon commercial is eating Pokemon so they all are edible
Hey i have a theory on pokemon pikachu dosent want to evole because when an owner has a max evoled pokemon and hes bored with it owner eats it and pikachu knows this pls notice me food theory
Who gonna stop me?
Aculy apilins body isn, t the aple its inside of it
You forgot to take into account the most likely diet of one of those animals. Hoothoot isn't just a common, fast growing bird. It's also an owl. Or a raptor to be more specific, which means it eats meat and is going to be more likely expensive to farm for that reason.
7:34 We just gonna ignore the fact that it's a gabite and not a garchomp?
Kiawe's family was really smart with the tons of mudbray on their farm (this comes from the anime if anyone is curious)
PS5  price has dropped tremendously online !  🔥🔥 here’s how to order 👉🏽 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G7mlZ-cWo3g
Only thing about Hoothoot is it isn’t shaped like normal birds… if it’s skull is the upper part of it’s head/body then a lot of that weight can be brain (especially since it learns psychic moves) which I don’t really know much about the edibility of. On the other hand most poultry we eat have really small heads and much bigger bodies. Just a thought I doubt anyone will see haha
Peta : THIS IS ANIMAL ABUSE CANCEL HIM
Speaking of eating Pokémon, I want to eat Lugia 🥴
I feel like farming a bunch of tauros and miltanks would be really hard since they're not as harmless as real animals
Ooof, did anyone else notice Matt pat accidentally use Gabite picture instead of Garchomp?
Gabite is now garchomp lol
7:34 thats a photo of gabite
The first video that relates to three Chanel’s
As soon as I saw the name of the video, my brain started a whole Will Forte scene…    “Cook the dog! Cook the dog! Cook your own dog? No child should be forced to do that. Dogs should be raw  And living.”
*And PETA cried.* The End.
This feels like a CLASSIC Game Theory episode. I love it.
Applin is a meat apple
MatPat: Dragonite, Tyranitar and Garchomp Pictures: Dragonite Tyranitar and Gabite
*SPOILER for Game Theory video*   So wait, how do you put out a video where in proving that Nurse Joy is a Pokemon, you also show that, based on in-game lore, all Pokemon were once human (or human-compatible sentient beings), and then partner that with a video describing the most efficient ways to farm them for food?
Nostalgia critic:pokemon sucks,stop making theories about pokemon  Matpat:ruins pokemon  Nostalgia critic:yes yes ruin pokemon yessssss!
I mean the magikarp is not edible because it is literally made out bone
Says Garchomp Shows Gabite Heart breaks
Mexico yeah he didn’t mention us but eat goats too
Bark
Yeah, but Mudsdale's weight has a lot to do with the literal caked on mud on its body. Plus considering its abilities, power, and intelligence, it wouldn't be a smart choice as it would destroy your ranch with one earthquake. Also, yes, Vege pokemon episode! =D  Then when you look at the in-game and anime actual ranches that have appeared, its usually Tauros, Skiddo, and Miltanks.
I LOVE how it's on food theory
Who eats horses and donkeys in real life? Europeans: We do!
7:34 *GARCHOMP*
Go to phillipines ._. I keep seeing goats here man -_- we even have meat of goats -n-
That was Gabite not Garchomp. But okay
Milltank  because  it sucks
Anything is edible if you're brave enough
So how does one crack a Geodude open? Is it like a crab?
I can imagine that vegan teacher reviewing this video. 🤣😂😂🤣🤣
I Got A Cooking Ad.
Good video but I think it is a bit flawed with using weight as a way to determine how much is produced. Some of these pokemon aren't necessarily all that weight in meat but also possibly bones and unique features. I would also suggest taking into account type of pokemon as some pokemons type can help determine the composition of those unique features.
what about seafood pokemon, which water type or fish pokemon is best to eat for omegas 3s.
im gonna go eat an Arceus
I think this just proves that Pokemon weight is nonsense
When did this became a horror channel?? This was the scariest content by far..😱
nurse joy!yum!
I’m too old for this now 🤣
8:53 There was an official phone game where I think it was about farming magikarp, and if you levelled them up too much they'd evolve and you had to release them
I'm surprised Pokemon Trainers don't fight alongside Pokemon though  Team Rocket Survives a 300km/hr fall and a TNT level explosion So basically trainers are just lazy as fk
Theoretically, there would be Vegans in the Pokémon world as well.  And there would also be a ThatVeganTeacher in the Pokémon world. 🎶Eating Pokémon is wrong🎶
That Gameboy-esque intro tho. 😭
I just I.... I'm not even going to watch the video Im just concerned
how would you fry HO-OH or Moltres? they are both already fried chicken.
The fact that the title of this video says "you should eat your Pokemon" meaning that the title say "eat the animal that you tamed, trained, and love." In other words, title says "eat pet"
yum!
Mmm mud.
7:37 MatPat says 'Garchomp' while the editor shows a picture of Gabite. way to make an obvious error for people to comment on. /j
Mewtwo won't like this
Wait wait wait.......back it up to 9:55 ..........5 regions into his journey and ASH just acted astonished seeing a pokemon from HIS HOME REGION which for anyone who wasn't around for gen one of the anime I think it's worth mentioning JAMES HAD ONE IN THE ORIGINAL SHOW SO HE SHOULD KNOW IT VERY WELL BY NOW!
dude now i gotta learn math to farm beef :/
my cousins love pokemon when they were younger, im sure if i tell them this their childhood would be ruined and they wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
YES. Eat your very own nurse joy. Welcome to the world of pokemon.
Okay so you're just ignore that you can get all the proteins you need from plants. It makes me sad that there is an entire video on how to exploit animals that dont even exist .
Please do an analysis of the berries in the Pokemon world, which ones would be most effective in eating, for people and pokemon, and why
https://youtu.be/8EJ3zbKTWQ8
Excuse me, "Muckrow"???
Ok now which one is the best in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding
They said human but I saw a Joy there
Day 2 for asking matpat to make a deltarune video
If I get to eat a Pokemon  I would eat.... Nurse Joy..     nothing sussy 😳🤣
It makes sense because in the pokemon universe some things can relate to food and also matpat forgot something what about EXOTIC FOODS
"Garchomp"
What’s the best jerky?? Chicken, beef, turkey etc.. Which one is more healthy and taste good and has most amount of protein
Before watching this I’m going to guess magikarp is the most efficient food source in Pokémon
Wow but you okay I assignment time
bacon causes cancer
Cries in vegetarian
Did anyone else notice something wrong with Garchomp? 😂
Where is the wall-e cannibal video when you need it
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
Hi
Matpat: Mudsdale and Mudbray are the best source of red meat in the Pokemon world. Me: Um.....you realize that Mudsdale can derail a train with a single kick right?
MA!!! Matpat's at it again!
Random but what’s up with the green flavored Harribo gummy bears being strawberry flavored? Is this true? If so whyyyyyy
So would this technically count as a game theory episode because it’s about Pokémon which is a game series
I can't stand the taste of goat cheese or goat milk just taste like pure goat... It's disgusting.
Let's hope That Vegan Teacher doesn't see this
Articuno, Zapdos and motres look delicious it eat now
hoothoot isnt an owl, its a turkey confirmed kek
*69th episode* Nice
Keep it PG Matt. No eating Nurse Joy
“My personal POKÉMON farming simulator” sounds like a game PETA would put out showing how POKÉMON (and by extension, Nintendo) is corrupt, yet again.
Aren't plants also living creatures
am i the only one low key triggered that mat used a gabite image instead of an actual garchomp..............????
Atc7:42 you said garchomp but showed a picture of gabite 😁
I feel like farmers in the Pokémon world are trained by the elite 4 if they wish to see another day.
huh. did not expect that. as always, very interesting and intriguing!
ahaa,,, matpat are you okay. what motived you to make this video.
:054 sad but factsssssssssssssss that is quite the high roller life to live hahah itl lbe preaty fun, just make sure you have plenty of nurse joy level clones of urself
2:42 why dose it just have charging noises threw me off 😅
yoooooo but yikessssssssssss what a video hahahah cheers!
I would just catch lots of magikarp evolve them boom my little tiny fish is now a full on 7 course meal
Charizzard is rather spicy
Yum
this video ruined my childhood
Oh mat, you make me realize that eating gogoat can make me eat my veggies and meat thank you.
7:37 uhm..thats a gabite ur showing o-o
YES!! i will eat my muk then.
Man Nerse Joy lookin extra edible
This video can be in food, film, and game theory
Ah yes. KFP employees are by far the most efficient source of meat (and superchats)
deez.
Random Comment
That's Gabite not garchomp
Vaporeon Trainers: YES
Okay *Eats Nurse Joy*
Hey Matpat! Video idea: why do onions make you cry? and testing remedies for it e.g. goggles Always wanted to know this 😊
He forgot that in a episode james, jessie, ash, brock, meowth, and misty almost ate a magicarp while stranded on a piece of wood. They decided it was not edible
10:58 I love how pikachu has a milk mustache but is using a straw
You forgot something Mat, how bout the things you can eat. Sure mudsdale is big, but as the name suggest it's mud. You think it'd be easy to cook or good to eat? There are certain things that you can't eat, like mud 😂. No but seriously, the difficulty in eating or prepping is another thing. What if the weight of that pokemon is all earth or mud? You can't eat that
Lol Mudsdale's mud encrusted hooves are what is giving it that weight
0:37 I dident know game theory was a girl
I mean... I'm sure at least a few people wouldn't mind "eating" Nurse Joy...  I'll see myself out...
Bruh, this thumbnail is cursed.
He didn't do the intro song i'm disappointed
You're forgetting about taste.  I doubt mud meat is very pleasant.
7:34 Matpat that’s not a Garchomp
Im upvoting for the sheer recognition of you using international metric measurements
I CHEWS you, Pikachu!     I know awful joke
What is the last channel to finish the ring? Food theroy film theory and game theroy but what is the last one??
7:33 erm......that's Gabite, not Garchomp
Me : Watching Ksi teach tommy how to ride a bike recommended:
ah yes, a reason to ruin childhood's life, thanks for nightmare Mat.
You just _know_ a ton of magikarp is eaten. Cause it's annoying to evolve it, and useless in battle, so~ yum-yum~ 🤤
15 on trending lol
me: *knows using theif on a snorelax gives you a leftovers that acts as food forever*
The fact that I saw this on my recommended, after exiting from a ThatVeganTeacher reaction video.
Okay I am gonna eat my Lillipup now
Me: *thinking of eating my ditto to get it's powers* Matpat: eat your pokemon Me: ok
NO MY CHILDHOOD
“And garchomp” Mat… that’s a gabite… Mat…
This is why I want to live in a world with normal animals instead of Pokemon.
0:50 why try and have friends when you can just play with yourself
Si
Matpat: **eats a Pokemon**  Me: **wheeze**
One thing to consider is the fact that Pokémon weight is not based on consumable meat alone; steelix weighs an insane amount but it’s pretty much just a living chunk of steel.  Similarly Mudsdale may not just be pure muscle, the body parts that give it weight could be dense mud or stone that are somehow part of the Pokémon’s body, and are likely thus inedible, or it could be that his muscles are incredibly dense and may potentially prove difficult to cook and prepare compared to say normal horse meat. Considering we don’t know much about the exact anatomy of Mudsdale I don’t know if it’s fair to say mass farms of Mudsdale are truly the most efficient farmable Pokémon for food production, but I like how we got there thus far.
Dude, #DaymDrops laid waste to Subway tuna in a vid where he ordered the same things his previous drive thru customers did. For 24 hours. Really think you couldn't go wrong with a collab in at least some form. Maybe a try at a holiday meal of questionable origin?
The people at game theory probably had to have at least 6 conference meetings to decide whether this was a game, film or food theory
tauros would seem to muscilar to be eaten it would be better to have miltank steaks
Do a Theory about land of  Stories
Theory idea land of Stories book Audible
7:30 Ah yes my favorite, Garchomp the Gabite.
OwO
imo poultry tastes worse than like, all the other beef and is usually like the dryest ever.
Do to owls being carnivores they would cost more to raise. The best "bird" Pokémon would be Pysduck same exp. rate and only 3 pounds lighter. While duck are omnivores making feeding cheaper.
3:36 oh yeah thats the same kind of food that kids in africa eat
7:35 Thats not garchomp... thats Gabite!
my childhood has been officially ruined, I wonder what wailord and Snorlax taste like?
now if you want a watermelon  and or watery pokemon  Vaporeon is best
https://youtu.be/UkodkfcBO3w
You’ve gone insane.
Vegans been real quiet since this came out
O God why
Spearow is much more aggressive than most Pidgey-clones, so I don’t think it’d be a good idea to farm them.
You know, that Miltank looking like a fine dine of steak...
I got a milk commercial when the vid was covering cows.
DUDE HE PUT GABITE FOR GARCHOMP
When your thinking on the logistics of pokemon nutrition and who can deliver it the best at a faster pace you know your in the food theorist channel xD
Id eat nurse joy
im a leg a thigh man so hoot hoot is a bad one for me
But what about me I am a Pikachu
I wonder if my red (shiny) gyarados would taste as good as the blue kind
as a human being i would like to say that i am officially leaving i am definitely a human so don't eat me that'll be all good bye you terrifying beings who i am definitely one of
Well, if you say.. Time to eat Nurse Joy then!

Nobody:  The vegan teacher:  MaTpAT iS eVil!
Rip our child hoods
i have a theory. you're actually a sociopath and only enjoy destroying innocent memories.
For Mudsdale, I think it would probably be so dense that it’s meat would probably be inedible, or at least extremely tough.
I mean there’s no animals that aren’t Pokémon in Pokémon soooo
Freind : have you even played Pokémon   Me: no but ask me anything i know it all
thanks i was making spageti now i want to eat diglet
Hands down the most dedicated video.
Peta and the vegan teacher aren't going to be too happy with this episode
An instant dessert is the ice cream pokemon. Single, double and triple scoops per evolution. just add fruits and/more sweetened milk
The Gameboy intro yo!
What about fish though
* Glances at gardevoir
Look, the options are eat your pokemon, or date and marry them.
idea for new theorist channel Music Theorists
Pokemon taste good i eat pokemon and i like love it.
The Food Sadists is more like it. I always did get bad vibes from these "theory" channels. Probably Marxists like those Extra Credit guys too.
So what about muk
I thought they were all vegans lol.
“And the pre-evolved forms of rarer pokemon such as Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp,”  *shows Gabite*
Matpat: *says Garchomp Also Matpat: *shows Gabite
But what if am vegan
I disagree on eating pokemons, i did it and choked on my cards
You are incorrect on age cattle are raised for meat production, you need to cut that about in half.  Over the UK, they raise beef cattle longer, but beef over there tends to be tougher and more gamey tasting as well because of that age.
your pronunciation of poor Pidove hurts me
in the games, every pokemon hatches at full size, so maybe de growth rate didnt matter
Before watching, of course you should, they are the only animals in that world.
Hoothoot just flat out resembles the shape of a drumstick.
Vegetarians don’t care about killing plants, they care about being healthy.  Protein in animals is second hand: Animals eat plants, animals eat animals: they get their protein from plants. I hope someday you’ll do a theory on why people think protein is so important to the diet? The only protein malnutrition we see is kwashiorkor and marasmus: true starvation. No lab test is used to check protein levels. We don’t need animal products: period. Please do research into that thanks.
…but aren’t they like light or something Edit: I mean you’re not WRONG? But… why. People are weird.
7:35 that’s gabite not garchomp
Slowpoke looks liked it'd taste like pork and be very fatty. If I had the choice, 100% I'm going for that slowpoke.
Now this is the thumbnail made out of nightmares.

You should make a video on the nutritional facts of sand. And you should also punch sand.
Perfection
I’d be curious about the fish Pokemon of choice as that is probably one of my bigger categories of meat I consume
Actually MatPat the Mudsdale line likely gets it's weight from alll the dried up mud that covers it's body so actually it's a poor choice.
the editing in this video is immaculate
7:35 That's a Gabite, Mat. I oughta...
I can't wait to eat eat nurse joy
Octowl would probably be bussin
Great video Matt Pat... I was surprised that goat milk was more popular. Too bad that the comments are swarmed with Nurse Joy jokes...
“Ruining your childhood since 2011”
I was going to make a NSFW question but then I realize I would be a degenerate if I did
I'm noticing that you humans would prefer to eat Nurse Joy more as a Pokemon than as a human... That's suuuuper sus...   Is that just a thing you do? I'm an AI bird girl... I'm not a human, does that mean you want to hit on me too?
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU
The bird part Sounded like the pokemon wrap.
Skiddoo... That made me laugh. Pretty sure it's supposed to be pronounced like "kiddo," like a kid (because, y'know, goat jokes). Just trying to help out!
If nurse Joy is a pokemon, and we eat pokemon... is it cannibalism and potentially murder to eat her?
Mattpat what would be the top three most eaten seafood in Pokémon. Mainly witch fish would most likely to be eaten
Ok but personally I think Pokémon 591 is a good food source
There's also evadince in sword and shield one of three dishes has a crabby claw stickin out
Birds are tasty.
Paris is a super food
MatPat made a mistake we eat 12 pounds of lobster year
Litten  here girl ! 😋
I think I need to switch my diet to fully Pokémon, if i can. That way, I won’t only become healthier from eating them but I’ll also know more Pokémon until I know all 800+ of them (and possibly more characters from the Super Smash Bros. multiverse of madness as well.)
Game theory: Pokemon are humans Food theory: Eat your pokemon
Uhh ok 👍💀🔫
Mat i raised boilers chicken in my front yard  And theirs so big and so tasty about 20 boilers  3 are left because we eat them
Oh god! Miltank shows up here! HELP!!!!
Am I the only one who notices that Hoothoot literally looks like a drumstick?!
Snowlax will be the biggest gummy bear.
I find this video as disturbing as it is interesting. You did put gabite instead of garchomp, but they are pretty simular.
*looks at my corvknight*...nah
I'm sitting here, watching this like anyone else. And halfway through I immediately thought "oh no. The vegan teacher is going to come for matpat."
using an image of gabite while you're talking about garchomp at 7:34...
Probably we can’t eat poison types
.... CHARIZARD
In conclusion, we should all be eating asses.
You should of mentioned Torchic and the in game KFC.... oh I can only hope for next theory...
why would you eat me
*That vegan teacher wants to know you're location*
Eat nurse joy?
You forgot about regional availability, which, true, would become less of a factor with more travel/migration, but makes it fairly difficult for, say, the people in Pallet Town to buy Skiddo milk or Mudbray meat if neither pokemon are found anywhere close to the region...
What the f
Thank for you for finally collabing with the Game Theorist, MatPat! Seriously, you have NO IDEA how long we've been waiting for one of the most epic crossovers of the century to drop.
The real question is does people and pokemon POOP
This is why you don't have friends
Your evil!!!
Furries: I'm four parallel universes ahead of you
I rarer eat my self!🖕
Well I know you can't eat a magickarp, they say it in the show when James and Meowth try to eat one
Take it from a farmer, cattle last one to two years before slaughter depending on their diet. Grain, is better because the cattle taste better. And grow faster. Grass fed grows slower and does not have an as good flavor.
A yes classic Matpat crushing dreams and ruining childhoods since 2011
Thanks there delicious
this is all cool, but you have not kept in mind the easyness of eating them. mudbray is indeed a 110kg pokemon, but it is also only 1m tall, meaning the density of the meat is VERY high. the same goes for hoothoot with 21kg at 0.7 m tall. they mey give very heavy meat but is it actually enough? does it actually give enough meat to provide? I would rather eat 10 bites of a piece of meat than have my jaw hurt after trying to lift 1kg with my jaw to try to chew it. I also think you should keep pokemon types in mind, certain types (like earth in mudbray) might make the meat way less edible and/or harder to prepare.
Seeing this makes me remember people cutting off slowpokes tails for high profit in the games
I just saw how he made nurse joy pop up and in game theory He says that she is a pokemon so is nurse joy a cannibal?
charmander is spicy
69th video
Gonna have a hoot watching this with my 8 year old son who loves Pokemon 😂
Wailord may not weight much, but there is a lot of meat there, just by looking at its size (that assuming the food does not float away, since it weights less than air)
13:00 - please keep types in mind. Steel types are likely to have less meat, if even made of it, and a rock or ground type is likely to be inedible. Think you can eat geodude? I don’t!
Delicious
A DONKEY WAES MORE THAN THE POKEMON'S  BLUE WHAL
If I were to be any Pokémon my choices have narrowed because now I’ll be a plant pokemon
Gabite does really look like it could be a final evo in some alternate timeline
ᒲᒷ ᓵᔑリℸ ̣  ᒷᔑℸ ̣  : )
I told my friends that they eat the Pokémon Because do they only have Pokémon for an animal
MatPat, this goes against my religion, I will not part take in the direct caloric intake via consumption of my best pokemon friends.
Why not just have some choice pokemons and breed Dittos? They seem to have found a way to create extra mass from nothing.
i hate to break it to ya.......... but that hoot hoot is 90% feathers >_< so you end up with a stringy tough 6-8 pounds of meat but enough feathers to make a few pillows.
Interesting but real world animals exist in the pokemon universe. Meowth has mentioned real world food like salmon and lamb. Sailor in the game mentions a beef steak. Ash dressed up as a cow and used a terrible pun "cowterpie" so must know of cows. I am certain other examples appear as well. Sure even restaurants in game and anime have featured food from real animals
Hey if everything is a pokemon then so is food  Especially them bouffalant I’m hittin them up first
Oh my god they are eating Pokemon...? How long did it take you to figure that one out?
Magikarp has the lowest egg cycle at 5. Meaning you only need 255*5 steps to hatch the egg. Heatran with flam body can cuts the egg cycles in half. Meaning you only need 255*2.5. You can also level/age it quickly with an Exp-All and  You can also breed pokemon of differing ID's and from other parts of the world for them to breed faster and have a higher chance for shiny. Magikarp evolves at Lv 20 and is 518.1 lbs. 22.0 lbs. Slaughter them at Lv 20 and watch the money roll in!
I will say I feel some pokemon also might be useful due to them having plants on them for ex bulbasaur you have the meat and maybe the flower for conception
Which Pokémon egg has the most protein? Asking for a friend
He dose relises  wail lord uses air to flout ( if you know om wrong please tell me thx)
yes, i would like to order a: blastoise turtle soup, a leafeon salad and some applin pie for dessert with a nice glass of moo moo milk
I would still want an entire episode of foodtheory dedicated on grass pokémon, why? Because you gotta 'round the diet, too much eat only makes you sick. So, what plant pokémon would be best in a healthy diet Matpat? You tapped in the topic, so you might as well double down on it!
Gotta eat em all
I’d eat a Gardevoir. **wink** **wink**
vegan teacher wont be happy with this video
Oh god.
You should also look at their typing.
Awesome
If you eat a pikachu garnished with eevee slices you can get a balanced meal that unlikes a special power. All you have to do is
Ostriches are delicious
I think this theory could be added on if you wanted to determine what each region's local diet would consist of (since each region has its own semi-unique variety of locally available pokemon).
I mean in the anime I remember seeing some of the Pokémon being farmed so I guess those would be on top of the list
7:32 Uh MatPat, that's a Gabite not a Garchomp.
Gordon ramsay: *THIS POKEMON IS RAW*
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him "go and sin no more"-Jesus
Matpat! You forgot that in the wild Miltanks are 100% female while Skiddo and Gogoat are 50/50 male and female. Therefore, you will get a milkable Miltank twice as often as a milkable Skiddo. That 2x multiplier will negate your point around growth rates.
Yum?
What about eggs? Unlike the real world, we wouldn't be limited to just birds and reptiles here, and this would likely use different metrics to determine the most efficient option   Or just ditto, because of its whole thing-
Now I just have to tell my pokemon to use double team free food if you ask me
just in  time
7:32 "rare pokemon like dragonite, tyranitar and garchomp"  *shows a gabite*  also, 12:02 hoothoot has 2 legs, it just stands on 1.  also also, 12:27 wailord is the floatwail pokrmon, that's why it's so light.
Technically could have also done a seafood category fo there is fishery farms...
Film theory is the forgotten middle child
Matpat there are many faults in your theory you usually do all your research but how could you missed one huge detail in the pokemon universe not only are there pokemon who is quite LITTERY made of food but there are some pokemon that are made of well....gass, sand, rock, and dare i say you do not want to eat thoses you looked at how despise it sides it alot heavier then other pokemon but missed the reason why isnt the name of the pokemon giving a big hint that horse not made of all meat but mud who would eat dirt and rumble
4:16 he wasn't kidding when he said Pokemon farming simulator
This should be on game theory
Progress Daily John hill music
Nurse joy is prob a ditto and I would like to use ivysaur to make salad and would love to eat Absol 😀
I got a pokemon ad for this video 😂
Those legendaries are starting to look tasty.
Wow a food, film, and game theory
Is this gordan Ramsay in the kitchen? XD
Land is cheap, for now
can someone make a game theory themed pokemon rom hack with just reskinned trainers and renamed moves
there is no such thing as "Pidgy clones", the mons u refer to r called "route 1 birds" or "early routes birds" (also u forgot wingull). there r also "early route mammals", usually rodents (Rattata, Sentret, Poochyena, Zigzagoon, Bidoof, Patrat, Lillipup, Purrloin, Bunnelby, Yungoos, Skwovet, Nickit, and Wooloo). last but not least, the early route bugs! :D (Caterpie, Weedle, Ledyba, Spinarak, Wurmple, Kricketot, Sewaddle, Venipede, Scatterbug, Grubbin, Cutiefly, and Blipbug) btw this comment took me like 10 minutes i think cuz i kept getting distracted and kept forgetting mons. (yes, i DO have ADHD, how could u tell??)
I got a cooking add before thiss
Product theory
As an Asian, I can confirm
hmm despite hoothoot being the biggest fastest growing and hatching bird type pokemon... if you look at most predators their meat will taste of ammonia because they are at the top of the food chain so thats why we dont eat real owls or vultures .
it’s not a pet store if there isn’t a kitchen
Matpat: the real plants aren’t living Me: well they are photovores so they must be a living species
That’s a gabite not a garchomp
yum, i love eating garchomp.
Looks at my skiddoo: I’m sorry buddy
Thats a Gabite, Not a Garchomp on 7:33
Thumbnail was hurtful. Lol. Could’ve used a Magikarp, ya know!!
best video to eat hands down
I mean when you gotta eat, you gotta eat.
Wait...huh? 😶
999 dislikes wow it’s weird
This thumbnail can be put out of context
*gardevoir crunching sounds*
But @thefoodtheorists, irl horses and donkeys are often not consumed for their meat for cultural reasons but also because they make excellent work animals, and are therefore more valuable as a source of labor.
That intro is gonna get it demonitized
7:38 das… das a gabite
Vegan teacher is mad 😡
What about the fish diet? Fish is almost as common as beef and chicken, and I wanna know if raising magicarp or goldeen would be more profitable
Bless the Theorist
Honestly I was expecting a fish category since the regions are based on Japan & fish is easy to raise a bunch of in short periods of time
Cant you cut a chunk off then heal them in a pokicenter then cut a chunk of again?
lmao that miltank squirting milk animation is cursed
More theory about Pokémon plants
Ya, region specifics would affect this. Plus you don't even look at fish - goldeen, magikarp, sharpedo... And let's not forget type - ie (like you did mention at the end with plant pokemon) what is that pokemon/animal made of? Miltank, Touros, Mareep & Pidgey are all probably flesh/meat beasts. But a Smiddo clearly has leaves growing on it - so is all it's weighing from meat? Same with the Mudbray is that all donkey meat. Or is some of that weight from ground/dirt and rock type? Like if you cut into that donkey is it actually edible? Or is it dirt?
I saw this in my recommendation and i was like WHAT THE FRICK
10K steps is about 5 miles, does this line up with actual measurements in game? Seems like people are taking massive steps if I had to guess.
What?
That’s not a Garchomp. That’s it’s middle stage Gabite. Sorry, that was just bugging me. Carry on.
Did he say applins grow on trees, the apple does but not applin
The vegan teacher doesn't approve of pokemon anymore.
Hay MatPat I have a question I would like you to answer. Are all the plant like Pokémon made from a type of meat or plant? Love if you could answer this. Thanks, keep up the good work!
Uhh the cow Pokémon
*Me,a vegan, watching this vid* :😱
7:33 Ignore the Gabite when he says Garchomp
But how much bone mass could Mudbray and Mudsdale. Is it just because their bones are really dense/solid raw metal/stone? Could the weight of their mane come into factor of what their weight is if Mud is part of their name, could their mane be some type of stone (but then they'd topple over but maybe they are just mostly muscle.  Just seems for the size/height, they would either be really reeeeeeeally tough meat or part of their body is earth based or they would need to be giant for body size vs weight/mass.
Minor pet peeve. You showed gabite instead of garchomp. Also "fetchling" and "mukrow"? Really? Is it really so hard to say fletchling and murkrow?
Applin lives in the apple and is not actually an apple, so you would just leave it homeless if you ate it.

A problem with mudsbray is that it is endangered. Also, it eats mud and you are what you eat (Hint: it's a ground type pokemon).
"pokemon farming simulator" YES PLEASE. I have wanted to be a pokemon berry farmer literally since I ever played my first game with pokemon pearl. Make it happen. I beg you. Let me be one of those people with their house along one of the routes where trainers come by to rest like it's a pokemon center, I'm here for it.
Excuse me but I believe that is a Gabite not Garchomp! 🤓
14:40 *cough* rule 34 *cough*
this looks like a lawsuit
Did You know that the Pokemon universe also has a complete food chain in the wild?
I'm afraid Mubray/Mudsdale's weights are misleading. Much of their weight comes from their fur which is caked in layers upon layers of hardened mud. This mud gets so hard and heavy that their hooves can damage roads.
MatPat, it is not Skidoo(only 1 "O"
man that legendary i ate yesterday was sooooooo goooood
given that pokemon show a greater degree of sentience, farming them for meat seems a bit like a hard sell. I mean if they are self-aware enough to interact with humans the way they do in the anime then they are self-aware enough to want to preserve themselves and others like them (squirtle squad or bulbasaur anyone? clearly sentient creatures).  Now can I see farming them to get other products like milk and such, sure. That is much easier since the pokemon farmer can pretty much just have a friendly working relationship with the pokemon. The pokemon could understand something simple like, "hey want an easy life where you don't have to worry about finding food on your own or being attacked? Then why not let me raise you on my farm and you can have all of that in exchange for me getting to have the milk you produce"
Always wondered what an electrified rat taste like
9:51 I don't get what the problem is here. Koffing is the poison gas pokémon, is it not?

Do a MHA food theory of if the gooey stuff toga makes when she shape-shifts into people is edible under the right conditions
7:43 “Garchomp”
Does that mean the rarer the pokemon, the more better it tastes???
ok but do pokemons hunt and eat other pokemons? Which is the apex predator?
😑 You post that video about how Nurse Joy evolved into a human and how Pokemon can evolve into humans and then you say we have to eat Pokemon.....
Wouldn’t Game Theory be the mother channel since it started it all?
Why
11:03 just gave me heavy memories of the Pokemon Rap
Advanced game boy SP
Battling isn't required for EXP though. Evolution could be performed just like in the day care center.
Hi Matpat I first wanted to let you know that my entire family watches your videos. Also a food comparison that sounds neat is the best tasting potato chip flavor.
do the plant pokemon anyway, I've been vegetarian since my birth so that isn't a factor for me. p.s. my entire family excluding my grandparents on my mom's side, who eat lobster on a cruise, are vegetarian
Peta gonna real act up here
Wait didn't the wii have a game like pokemon rancher
The title is so messed up its good
How come most pokemon come from eggs? Just to keep things simple maybe?
7:36 that is not a garchomp that is a gabite
W-w-where is the omega mart episode 2 we have no idea where it is!
Mmmmmm...HootHoot strips.
Thanks to bad we don’t have hoothoot tho the meat sure dose look good tho
This has now got me asking the question of what the best Pokemon equivalent of fish meat like cod is? Magikarp can be ruled cause it's just scale and bones, maybe wishiwashi or perhaps goldeen or seaking.
Dude I just realized if Pokémon where real we would solve world hunger do you know how fast we can breed Pokémon and then eat them
i'm not so sure about the mudbray is best idea. as it's a ground type pokemon, couldn't the extra wt just be tied to its typing and its actually just has like, super heavy fur and bones. and sure, Hoothoot might be heavier than pidgey clones, but you might need a threat assessment category for livestock. typical pidgey clones can probably be bound and rendered harmless, but hoothoot can hypnosis and more with a look and might have the "foresight" to not go quietly into the shed that its friends didn't come back from.
Dhelmise would be pretty edible tbf
im not eating my glaceon
By this logic, we should eat more pigeon...
what about Chansey and Blisseys Egg?
Wait.... can’t you just raise dittos, hire a one of the tastiest and plentiful meat Pokémons to show to them. And then just slaughter them will they are transformed?
You need therapy for coming up with that title.
Theory idea: How much would it cost for the loud parents to run the loud house, there is 13 people and like 3 breadwinners, plus Lori's college. Must be a hefty bill
I feel like another thing that should of been considered is the Pokemon's power and intelligence. Raising a Mudsdale for meat might not be the best idea when one of them could just earthquake the entire farm to the ground.
7:35 thats gabite
I have just about every legendary , Mystic and Rare Pokemon    Think I can make a fortune having Gordon Ramsey cook up some Arceus Steaks
69th video with 6.9k likes
3:14  Matpat:nurse joy is not a human!!! Also matpat: Me:👁👄👁sir what😀
Me:looking for thatveganteacher's comments
That’s a Gabite my good sir
7:30 man put a gabite instead of garchomp
Yeah mat if you start going through the weight and height of pokemon it makes you question life like "my god my dad is taller than a charizard!?"
Wow what about fish?
Thank you so much , matt patt , i will now consoom gardevoir.   I'm sure she won't mind.
I'd take the combuskin with a side of cherim and a skiploom salad
But Matt the plants vegetarians eat are already alive and can feel pain. Plant pokemon wouldn't make a difference.
MatPat help me there's a snitch reply to my comment even I already report multiple times because this isn't fun anymore as this is call harassment.
Instructions unclear, I tried to eat my Grapploct but he punched me and now I'm at the hospital with a broken arm
Is it just me or does that Garchomp look a little bit like a Gabite 7:33
Fun fact: the apple is not part of applin and the model itself shows it
IF you are a hacker you know that they modeled applin as a worm and is completely separate from the apple so boom intro busted
Jesus Christ loves you
I'd like to eat Nurse Joy 😏
Which pizza place has the best in general?
Remember, don’t eat magikarp without preparing it. They have bones
Metagross? What are you doing there.   Unless your also mean mega forms as legendary pokemon
Pigeons have actually been eaten in the past (squab) and honestly, it would still be beneficial for us to eat them now. They grow fast and breed fast and have a fairly decent amount of meat while also being domestic animals so it's not necessarily a bad idea to farm pigeons as an additional source of protein. We just have to get around the whole "rats with wings" stupidity (especially since rats can also be eaten and should be).
POKEMON sorry
Me:Pokemon is a grate shou. MatPat:YOU SHODE EAT YOUR PKEMON!!! Me:(._.) Me life is a lie
never wanted to eat  a pokemon until now. would definitely eat hoothoot meat.
Ah yes time to boot up the ol, DS
i was afraid he was going to say togepi
Non Pokémon animals do exist in the Pokémon world.  Several Pokédex entries reference them and in one of the movies Archeus refers to Pokémon as magical animals as he missed out on the development Pokéballs.  So there are obviously non magical animals.  However Pokémon actually reproduce way faster than real world animals so they are still the go to food.
Being a vegan in the Pokémon universe must be really hard!
Make a theory of the honeycomb from squid game if you want idk
Pidove is pronounced "pee-dove", long e sound
In Pokémon you see fisherman fishing for magicarp so it’s pretty obvious they do consider some Pokémon as food lol
You know Mudbray/Mudsdale just mainly eat dirt right? I'm mean you wouldn't have to worry about feed, but... the taste of a Mudbray/Mudsdale.  Wouldn't that be like eating giant earthworms. I dissected one in Science class once, there was just dirt inside DX
7:33 that ain’t garchomp
Matpat: lamb is a luxury food.  The Mediterranean, middle-eastern, and south Asian countries: lmao, this guy speaks funny

I mean eating horse meat would explain why ash is able to pick up cosmoem
Mat pat definitely not a vegan
Hoothoot..... Me: Not Hooty.......................!!!!!!!!!!! (Owl House reference)
How could you eat a Pokemon? They're so cute. (I say as I eat a fish)
I'm not eating Owlbert
I would like to argue something ignored by.. a fair chunk of the comments section.  Have you SEEN farm animals? They chase, sprint, headbutt, jump, splash in any puddles they find.. much of which is play-fighting.  Pokemon in the anime train amongst one another (even outside of true battles) and headbutt trees and rocks to grow stronger.  a fast enough leveling pokemon, given ample space and other pokemon to play with (""Battle"") wouldn't need much oversight from a farmer to evolve. While this doesn't disprove using a horse/donkey pokemon for meat, it does give more opportunity to use other pokemon as a food source.
Says garchomp shows a gabite everybody,         " I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that”.
12:03 hoothoot actually has 2 feet it just likes to tuck one of them away
Food Theory: Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon. Also Food Theory: "Our newest episode all about how Nurse Joy is secretly a Pokemon." Are, are you telling us to....you know?
What about sea food? What would be the best?
Finally i can have a torchic for dinner
PETA didn't see anything, plus I got a fairlife ad.
I am only saying this because garchomp is my favorite Pokémon. You used a gabite when you said Garchomp. Show my boy some respect.
7:33 garchomp looks kinda funny
Wait what about ditto the Pokemon that can be any Pokemon. Because then the question is does ditto still maintain it's food output and grow time or take the new one of the Pokemon it became. Both will be different answers
Imagine being stupid enough to bite on a rock
who tf is eating horse meat?
Think alot of people in the comments make sense, this wasent really well thought out by Matpat.
This thumbnail made me existential
No one bothered how at 7:33 Mattpat says Garchomp and then the on screen imagine is a Gabite. I was waiting for a joke or a quirky edit but no he just goes on
Havent even watched yet. Just read the title and my brain went "oh. No. Why?? NOOO!"
anyone else noticed the food theory font is from gameboy advanced start-up
can you actually make Theory O's

I legit forgot that i was watching a pokemon food theory

Applin is the wyrm inside the apple (wyrm because dragon type)
My past: Plays the games in the intended battling and trading card ways. My current self: Am i in the same egg group as [blank]? Me today: I'd rather not eat them.
I wonder who has the best steak in taste, smell, look, and tenderness
Paw patrol eat them
Ma t pat u forgot about chansey eggs
Dragonite Tyrantar and Garchomp, Shows gabite
I’m sorry matpat but you used gabite’s picture not garchomp’s pictute for the incubation part, I’m ashamed but I get it, not everyone is a Pokémon expert so I’ll forgive you this one time.
7:34 that’s not garchomp, that’s it’s previous form gabite
I'd eat Nurse Joy ;)
I think hoothoot would probably taste too gamy for people.
So we should eat nurse joy?...
10:38 used to be a restaurant chain near where I lived that specialized in ostrich burgers.
Just how wealthy do you think the '1%' actually are?  In America in 2021, you're technically in the top 1% if you're making a little under $800,000 a year.  I've known a few people who fit that description, and they were hardly eating caviar and veal every day.  Maybe a couple times a year, if that.  Just because their income is moderately high doesn't mean they were taking home outrageous amounts of pocket change.
Glad there’s normal plants in the Pokémon universe

Hello, has anyone contacted Dr. Harkness about your findings?
Just gonna dislike this video just bc
Why do they eat pokemon?!😭
Someone who has a ditto in pokémon: IM RICH!!!
Just a thing. That was not garchomp but it's preevolution Gabite
You forgot an very important fact about the owl pokemon.. IT HAS ONLY ONE LEG, which means its half as tasty as the other bird options.
This goes up there with the villain of Final Fantasy Unlimited eating Chocobo soup when I was a kid. (Ohno poor chocobos)
1:02 anyone who has read the pokedex entry for farfetch'd: "Yes."
That Miltank lookin tasty
FYI, Applin is not the apple. It lives inside of the apple. Here is a quote from Applin's pokedex entry in Sword, "As soon as it's born, it burrows into an apple."
Ash could be looking at anything about that Koffing like stats movelist level. He dose not question what it is he is not that stupid.
Um, Matt that's not a Garchomp, it's a Gobite
IN A DAY!
I always like to imagine in stead of hoothoot being pronounced hoot hoot it’s pronounced hoo thoot
He made two Pokemon Videos
1
Applelin Isnt the Apple IT Is JUST a little worn inside the apple
Dragonite, tyranatar, and garchomp (shows a picture of gabite)
I'm curious what Pokemon the seafood places are selling. Steamed Shelder anyone? Maybe broiled Magikarp?
Pokemon plant products would probably fall under the same vegetarian-but-not-vegan category that eggs and milk do in the real world. You could probably grow and harvest roots or vines from certain Pokémon at a sustainable rate that does not harm them, sorta making for a blend of farming and ranching.
Imagine eating an eevee this is horrible
7:34 that's a Gabite not a Garchomp
MAT PAT Make a theory on spooky month!
great episode but I myself feel like weight alone is not the best metric to determine the amount of meat they have on them, you should also include the over all mass of a Pokémon and maybe also include the type as i feel like a Ground type Pokémon's meat would be dirty or taste like dirt and mud, and maybe thats why Mudbray and Mudsdale are so heavy is that they literally have mud in their bodies weighing them down
I miss the old Gameboy start up. It was simple but fun.
For all you vegan meat eaters in Pokémon, eat a gogoat.
Just because it's heavy doesn't mean the weight comes from edible meat, and if it does, unless the animal/pokemon is also large, that strongly implies the meat is going to be hella dense, borderline inedible.  I don't think people would be eating that mud donkey.
the thumbnail is really disturbing
I mean... Milcery is litarally milk lol
7:37 Yes, that is definitely a Garchomp
NO
I'm sorry but this theory makes absolutely no sense, the foundation on which you argue that is. How quickly a Pokémon levels up does not matter at all. A level 1 Pokémon will always weigh as much as a level 100 Pokémon (looking at Pokémon Go, yes weights can vary between individuals but they do not change dependent on level). Also you directly contradict yourself. You say that you won't consider evolution because farmers won't battle their livestock,  sure, yeah, but then how would these Pokémon gain experience for their level ups (that don't matter but let's entertain the thought that they do)? We know Pokémon gain small amounts of experience through other means than battles, but really not a lot. So yeah, it does not matter at all how fast they would level since they wouldn't level at all (since there are no battels) and even if they did it would change absolutely nothing that relates to their worth as livestock.
Well Covid started by eating a Zubat in the alternate universe of Pokémon 😳
The vegetarian bit proppa made me laugh 😂😂😂😂
and in usa humans eat steer(castrated males) cows(females) after no longer can be milk productor are turned into feed usually for dogs and cats.
I swear these videos have been released before...
Mmmmmmmmmm yes electric rat
Their might be an issue with mudsdale. A big contributor to its weigh is likely the large amount of mud that forms at its feet that are said to be harder than stone, and so hard it can turn a truck to scrap with a single kick.
No love for bug types? Weedles and Caterpies are going to have a good protein content and be super easy to catch
matpat every plant is edible, there are just consequences that come after eating
Just in time for Canadian thanksgiving I'll give it a try!
Weight alone seems like a poor measure of how much meat you get out of a pokemon. How much of that weight is actually meat? Mudsdale may clock in at an impressive 2k pounds, but given it's height of 8 feet tall, it's almost as tall as a mature elephant, but with a fraction of the weight. It seems like most of that weight will be coming from it's robust and massive skeletal structure and there would be considerably less left for the meat. Given it's lean appearance and the amount of weight it needs to move around, the muscles would also most likely be very tough, and might not make for an enjoyable dining experience.
I think Mudsdale and Mudbray are as thicc as they are because of the fact that when they run around, there is a super think layer of mud that covers their hooves that hardens and gets really heavy. I know it's unlikely that they can lift that much weight on their hooves, but they can level buildings with an earthquake or two, so maybe...
are you guys ok?
got to eat them all
Me watching this vid:😟
I'm looking forward to eating Nurse Joy
Person: im gonna eat this magikarp  *magikarp uses splash*
Uwu
You didn't tell us what fish would be the most common food source! Fish may not be consumed as much in most areas, but is absolutely a main food source for some cultures and still a staple in most homes. I mean what American didn't grow up eating tuna fish sandwiches, even my picky siblings that hate fish make an exception for that one.
Mouth is now watering for some BBQ Emboar Ribs
🤣it doesn't weigh in on hothouse favor especially since he's already shaped like a drumstick
Bruh they say garchomp when it’s a picture of a Gabite 7:30
Btw im vegatarien soo no MEAT for me..
I mean its pretty obvious, but yeah they never adress it.
Gonna take a guess at 4:09 and say that people eat a LOT of Magikarp. The first 4 games are based in Japan, so they eat a lot of fish. Magikarp are abundant, cheap, easy to fish for with an Old Rod, grow fast and hatch fast, and Asian Carp (which the fish is based on) is a popular meal from Japan to India. Suffice to say it’s very edible xD
What implies they need to battle to evolve? ./.
Everyone Probably hates you right now
Love ya mat but raising a nocturnal hunter as livestock wouldn't be efficient. Also I imagine a lot of the horse Pokemon weight would come from muscle.
Huh Tastes like that one pokemon
Did you consider the Chonkachu?
The higher the Pokémons level… the tastier it is
Just 1 small problem The set of pokemon you picked as the main producers of food products do not appear in all regions  So different regions would have different Pokemon for the food products
T-that wasn’t garchomp tho
I would like to mention Mudsdale’s weight is a false showcase of the amount of meat and bone on it.  It’s legs and hair are covered in a ton of dried mud which boosts its weight by a fair margin  Mudbray still probably is the most efficient in comparison
Now I know what to order when I next visit kanto 😂😂
What about Dietary Restrictions??
I watched the nurse Joy video before this one
7:34 "And Garchomp..."  *Shows a picture of Gabite*
7:34 …Garchomp?? 😅
I would 100% eat nurse Joy 🤤
There was also the time team rocket tried to eat Magicarp.
p sure that’s not garchomp
but owels is not a animal you wanna eat irl so i dk but ya is the shiny ones then use for animal shows and stuff ? what you wanna grow or train to win that?
Matpat should do a theory ‘What The Great British Bake Off is really planning’
Am I the only one who kinda wants a Pokémon farming game now?
That's a Gabite, not a Garchomp, but sure
Well… hoot hoot does just look like a chicken drumstick with a face..
Anyone got a list of Pokemon we'd eat?
Wait...I thought pokemon and humans were once one in the same, and long ago even married one another. Are...are they cannibals?
No eating my Alcremie, just saying
Can Hoot Hoots fly?  (I don't play Pokemon games.)  It's a point to consider, since one important quality of domesticated animals is that they are easy to catch and keep.  That's why poultry birds are flightless, since if they could fly away, it would be a lot harder to prevent them from escaping.
Why pokemon!
Mmm… food
Look at Pokemon Unite Battle : https://www.youtube.com/user/PrEzEs8824/videos
so we know the best pokemon for eating.  but, guys, did you know that in terms of...
Hey I mean if all vegetarians and vegans out there don't want to eat grass type Pokemon you can always support your local berry Farmers! Always fresh and always in stock!🍇🍉🍈🍌🍓🍒
.
magicarp would also be pretty good fish source
1:34 Noooo don't eat me
I think Pokemon Co need to revisit the Pokédex entries and change the Pokemon weight. A lot of them don’t make sense.
First
Matpat:You can eat pokemon Me:B-but I don't wanna eat eevee!
Let alone Pokémon that probably eat people. Just a heads up-
goat milk & cheese, & horse meat? is it France?
So, AFAWK, plants don't talk, but they still feel what we would call pain. Chew on that one.
7:33 That's not a garchomp. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
I bet whalelord has a water bladder that fills with water when it wants to sink and otherwise floats on the surface perfectly like you see in the anime a few times
What about the fish Pokémon
Anyone else gonna point out that the picture they used for Garchomp is actually Gabite?
Well in of the episode when Ash and his group go to some hotel they eat Magicarp there!
Quick theory idea where do pokemon go when a trainer dies
This is a question do Pokémon exist in real life
U said hatching but the picture is gabite
7:22 ah yes, Gabite, my favorite Garchomp
Is said garchomp but shows gibite
Also, there is a lot of bullshit in this video. Beef is profitable in America because of the massive subsidies that the beef and diary industry receive from the government. Also, how about outright saying that the caloric efficient of just eating the crops ourselves gives us a caloric efficiency of 100%.
He forgot about Pokémon that help hatch eggs faster like centiskorch whit flame body
I eat ALL of my pokemon
Murkrow, Mat It's MURKROW with 2 R's not mukrow mukrow sounds gross -me
Now I wanna make some Magikarp sushi cuz why not
Save the pokemon and go vegan!
Nobody Matpat:Ash mom is a time traveller who created artificial pokemon and killed Ashs father.
I don't feel hoothoot would be a good choice as it's based on owls, which aren't herbivores, meaning the hoothoot probably isn't an herbivore either and non-herbivores are bad investments because it costs more to feed your livestock meat rather than plants
3:54  why do we  specific animals for food. Me: what
All the vegans be disliking this video.
Not the first but not the last... UM ACTUALLY THATS A GABITE NOT A GARCHOMP
This hits right in the childhood.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos.🎈
Would ditto be a good farm Pokémon? Can mate with any Pokémon and could produce eggs like non other, and could transfer to be milked or killed to get meat of any Pokémon?
Can I eat nurse joy?
Theoryos should be real
People can also be Vegetarian or Vegan for Dietary reasons Please Correct!
Ah yes the pre teen garchomp next to the other sudo legendary pokemon
It's amazing how much knowledge you can gain from exploring video game lore and applying it to real-world poppycock (wait can I say poppycock on YouTube?). I'm fascinated every time I learn something on this channel.
Why did u pronounce Murkrow like Muk-crow lmao
Why...
POKESWEETS. GO STRAWMANDER.  STRAWMANDER.  *takes a little bite of strawmander. The strawberry shortcake Pokemon.*  Mmm. Sweet. These are supposed to be eaten. They can instantly regenerate and you have so many sweets.
The Vegan Teacher would have a heart attack if she saw this.......
If Whimsicott is here, I'll cry about it.
3:14 says regular people, puta up a picture of a pokemon
Matthew: Eat your pokemon! Also Matthew: Nurse Joy is a pokemon! I see where you're going with this...
Watching this video actually made me seriously consider going vegetarian.
7:35 that's a Gabite, not a Garchomp 😅
Your forgetting something about the plant pokemon MatPat, its that (many, though not all) would provide TWO types of foods, the plant and the meat. A bulbasaur is a frog thing WITH a bulb on its back. And that RED MEAT might be able to be created much more efficiantly in the pokemon world because instead of it needing to eat, it could use photosynthesis for much of that energy.
Somewhere out there the vegan teacher is having a cesurae
Good video. Would love to see a breakdown for this for each region, since not all of these pokemon are available in every region. Which means you would need to import them into the region, which may make them more expensive than the local but less efficient Pokemon found there.
lets be honest, who would eat these Pokémon if they exist in the real world ?
your a phsco path crazy
I don't really think I'd get far trying to eat my Surperior. I think it would Prob most likely go the other way around if I even tried much less they wouldn't find  me appetizing.😅 anyways
"and garchomp" AS HE SHOWS A PICTURE OF GABITE
Matpat when did you start eating dragons?  (For context, Applin is a little dragon inside an apple.)  Also Slowpoke tails do grow back
I have a strange hankering for some Snorlax now
APPLIN NOOOOOO
Okay but I wouldn't eat a horse or donkey
Great he ruind my childhood :(
Why would you eat Pokémon that’s so wrong and illegal but I subscribed cuz I like This
Someone call BDG, someone did Pokemon Edibility for him.
yummy
The amount of mispronounced words in this video irritates me. "Poke-em-on" instead of the correct "Po-kay-mon", "Muck-row" instead of "Mur-crow", etc. The Poke-em-on I hear way too often from people that are actual fans though so I'm used to it though....
PETA: Write that down, make it a game!
Nurse joy
You Forgot Fish.
Ok
You  applin is not the apple its a bug in the apple you can see it in its dragon evolution
7:33 "Garchomp" proceeds to show gabite
Would a Pokémon eating another Pokémon be cannibalism if there in a different egg group or just a different Pokémon in general? Like if there was ever a tomato Pokémon and pika chi drank the ketchup from that Pokémon would that be cannibalism?
i feel like ive never seen a comment with a dislike
Imagine eating Pokémon for breakfast. Literally imagine, Eating your own Pikachu
Uhhhh, would you eat Jinx?
Miltank has a faster base speed than Rayquaza. A goddamn cow is faster than the god of the skies.
The donkeys might be too dense to eat comfortably.
I want to immediately weigh in that Mudbrey tastes like mud. It's in the name. Taste is part of this equation
PETA’S gonna love this one
So, here we go: You said about different regions so here is one for the follow up theory: You took in considerarion the national Dex, but you know, not all Pokemon live in the same place, Skiddos for example live in very very few regions even with remakes for previous regions they did not add it to a lot of regions, so what would be the most common food for each region, considering what Pokemons live there and how common they are
0:00 general kenobi!
Everybody: Skiddo MatPat: Skid-DOO
Well finely now i can finely do something with my unused pokemon in my box
7:34 *Shows a Gabite instead of a Garchomp*
0:19... in animals? No joke there are real animals in the world of pokemon they are just a minority it was confirmed by the director
In Canada all T-bone steaks come from an animal under 18 months. Over 18 months the spine and head are disposed of in an incinerator to control the spread of mad cow. So saying three to four years for beef is a bit of a misnomer. The best cuts are all from animals under two.
Skidoo is a baby
With the intro, u do realize applin is just the worm right
the vegan teacher aint gonna be happy bout this one XD
Garchomp I think that’s gabite
The biggest flaw in this theory is that weight doesn't equal harvestable resources. Hoothoot is most likely similar to Magikarp being near all skin and bones. Also mudbray and mudadale are partially made up of rock or earth which wouldn't be edible. Lastly growth rate is exp, not literal growth, though you could consider them the same that would mean that pokemon would naturally evolve with age.
7:34  Anyone else really annoyed at this?
Mat Pat... you dareth suggest eating my favourite Pokémon... Mudsdale doesn't need this 🤣🤣
7:34 you called gabite garchomp.
I got a Pokémon add on this vid
That is just scary that nurse joy is a Pokemon.
Everything is edible if you try hard enough
Matt, that wasn't a Garchomp. Great Video!
7:35 That's a really weird garchomp
Congrats mat pat on food theory’s 69th episode. keep up the good work
Is nobody gonna pick up that he said garchomp and showed a gabite? haha
Now all I can think of is ash trying to drug Pikachu to  cook and eat him for some reason ;-;
12:52 ah yes my favorite legendary, mega metagross
Vegetarians are the ones mowing all rhis tall gras
paimon 🤝 pokemon    *everyone wanting to eat them*
Seriously this is what you are doing it on, and why is Ash always used for Pokemon stuff he was a good person and he always cared about his pokemon   Actually there are real animals in Pokemon world you can see many times that there are real fish existing in they're world its just the Pokemon are more interesting and more of them  Don't think our world and they're world is the same or Game and anime world they are different as well  Just cause its heavier does not mean it has all that weight in edible meat it could be other parts that you cannot eat that is all that weight
7:34 Who wants to tell him that is a Gabite, not a Garchomp?
It would be cool to go into the geography of each region as well and get into the economics of space and manpower. Like the goat/cow divide you spoke about in the beginning.
You have a dirty mind if you imagined something else upon reading the title.
2 issues with this biggest one is you didn't go by region, each region has different pokemon nativity available like in Johto and Alola we know that they use miltank since goagoat isn't readily available for example And 2. There is some ethical questions considering pokemon are far more sentient than irl animals
The reason mudbray’s evolution line is so heavy is because of all the mud that’s on their body. They probably aren’t anywhere near the actual weight in meat.
Aplilin isnt the apple its the wyrm
I am a Pokemon vegan
Great. Some trainer is going to try to cook up some Zubat and spread Confusion around the world. Thanks.
You guys really butchered that game boy advance intro
I wonder If the animals we eat will change, when cloned meat becomes a bigger factor in the meat industry? It should, because farming would not be a factor and neither would the size of the animal be important anymore.
I have to imagine ground types like mudbray wouldn't taste great. Its probably so heavy because its flesh isn't very... fleshy
Wouldnt Hoothoot require less spendings on food, medicine and living environment in general than Mudbray to grow enough though?
Maybe there are regular animals in the Pokémon world that aren't Pokémon. 🤷🏻‍♀️
You mentioned plant based Pokémon and didn’t actually include it in the theory! Now we need an entire episode based on it!
Bruh, the Theory'Os, thats hilarious
Haha magicarp I was about to eat evolved I need help
0:00 general kenobi
7:33, not complaining, simply an observation, but that's the sprite for Gabite, not Garchomp
I think we may need one of these for each region, considering you would have to import mudbray meat into the regions where it can't be found natively. A more local option may be a better value
So, just ignoring that they sell Miltank's milk all over the Pokémon world, then.
My man completely forgot that depending that the mudbray is a rock type so u might break your teeth eating him
"Garchomp" (shows Gabite)
Why is Pokemon food so interessting?
No
Still.... How is that horse pokemon bigger than Snorlax?!
4:40 did you seriously include China and India?? The two most fertile lands on earth?? the gangetic plains of india are more fertile than the floodplains of the Mississippi along with the extremely fertile land in northern china
Pokémon Farm Simulator? Well, there was My Pokémon Ranch back in Gen IV.
What would be considered "full maturity" in a Pokemon, though? For Pokemon that evolve, I'd assume it'd mean when they reach their last stage of natural evolution - so not counting anything where you need external factors like stones or trading. But with a single stage evolution Pokemon, how would you even know when they reached that point? If a Pokemon can battle right out of the egg, who's to say they couldn't provide things like meat, dairy, and eggs almost immediately as well?
I still feel doubtful about Hoothoot because real owls are made up of so much floof. The scales don't lie, though, I suppose.
Pikachu taste: mac and chese Challmander: bacon Sqirtle(not food) : water The grass pokemon starter: Grass
Does Anyone else feel that the background music was too loud
I remember in the sun and moon show there was this one scene where they at octilery.
The last ‘rare’ Pokémon you mention is actually a Gabite, not a Garchomp. Just throwing that out there for those that don’t know.
The fact that he puts a pokemon video on his food theory channel disturbs me.
Pardon?
I think of game theory more of a big brother channel then a sister channel
Gotta munch em all!!
I liked the approach to determine the results but I don't think the weight system works with the final category where Mudbray is considered the most efficent: I'm pretty sure the reason why Mudbray and its evolution are so heavy is because they're covered in hardened mud... plus the weight (and height) values for pokémon are pretty unreliable since they can't go over 1 ton which considered the size of some pokémon it just doesn't make any sense...  (Weirdly enough though Wailmer being so light kinda makes sense since it's supposed to look like a blimp)
given that this was posted around the same time as the "Nurse Joy is a pokemon" theory, I am now concerned for her safety. Do you want to eat a Nurse Joy, Matthew? DO YOU?
Meat eating in Pokémon seems maybe looked down upon.  Everything seems more like it’s vegetarian.  Obviously some people eat Pokémon and even Pokémon eat each other but it never seems common in more “civilized” parts of the world of Pokémon
I lived in India and in India most of people never eat beaf . Because Beaf  is came from cow and cow is important in hindu religion so Only monetary like Muslims  eat beaf.  Even most of people eat non-veg only on special occasions and  rajasthan which is most  dry region in India is actually most vegetarian region in India. Not only that most of non-veg people lived in India eat pig goat Chicken  eggs or fish they never eat beaf or horse's meat. So if Pokemon lived in India they all  are safe. Because there is very less chance to eaten by some human.
i already knew that pokemon are eaten cuz where do they get the fish or meat theres no cow
Far fetched is extinct?! I stopped watching and playing after leaf green on gba.    …he _IS_ LiTtErAlLy holding a green onion tho.   Edit: 💁🏿
People are eating zubat lets face it you go outside find a cave get  a fly swatter and there you go
Mathpat: yes this pokemon (gebite) is called garchomp 7:34
This video actually making me consider about becoming vegetarian 😭
I saw this meme that showed ash  eating a pikachu and he turns super saiyan (sorry if I spelled it wrong)
7:35 It pains me to see a Gabite when you said Garchomp and it isn't even a bloody sprite
Gogoat- mOrE lIkE GO GURT
My fav skiddo finally gets some attention
ALL humans are Pokemon. This is old info.
have anyone told steph about this? about MatPat eating nurse Joy?
The problem with Mudbray and Mudsdale is most of their weight is probably comprised of some type of inedible metal
Film theory continues to be the forgotten middle child…
No mention of the Rare Candy industry 👀
While yes Miltank is the first thing i thought of...its not just because of the fact its a cow, im sure you will bring this up in the video (as im writing this comment whilst still watching) but there *is* an item in the game called MooMoo Milk.
I lost all comfort I had while starting this video when he ate the applin
3:50 Why do we use specific animals for food? It's in the Bible, Deuteronomy 14, though, people don't like to follow God's way's. We can eat Ox, Sheep, Goat, deer, gazelle, roebuck, wild goat, ibex, antelope, mountain sheep.  Any creature from the waters with fins AND scales, meaning crustaceans are not allowed. Any ground based bird, like pheasant, chicken, turkey, or "clean" bird.  We are NOT allowed to eat, camel, rabbit, pig, hyrax, rock-badger, shephan, any predatory creatures with paws and claws, (dogs, cats, bears, lions, ect) any unclean bird that eats meat (eagles, hawks, owls, ext) any bird that eats dead things like vultures, and insect with wings, or bat that eats them.  As for Cow, we can only eat the Bull that is sanctified and sacrificed on the alter of God.  "You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud."  "The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses."  "But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean."  "Do not eat anything you find already dead."
Ghost Pokemon be like hmm which human
I love the pokemon theories they are always fun!
Vegan teacher won't be happy
Watch Hoothoot's fur be like 40 pounds in weight and the meat is just a long thin meat stick
Does he really call pidove πdove?
Things to say  1.They sell milk tank milk at shops and have them at farms, there aren't for rich people :/  2. Pokemon evolve in the wild by also getting older (in lore, also certaint Pokemon) we can also see this because there are evolved Pokemon in the wild  3. They eat toros burgers, they said it a lot.
You didn't factor in how dangerous of an animal they are which would decide the environment you would have to put them. Normal farm animals don't have magic ice or fire conjuring powers
I'm actually going to argue against the Mudbray/Mudsdale, because they mix dirt with their saliva to create essentially concrete that they cover themselves in. That drastically increases their weight, and the effort of dragging it around would cause their meat to be extremely tough. The Pokedex says they eat the dirt, so they may also incorporate it into their internals. General guidelines for pokémon you shouldn't eat: Ground, Rock, and Steel types because of the mineral deposits throughout their bodies, Poison types because poison, and Fire types because the intense heat required to cook them is impractical.
I'm glad that you didn't spend a lot of time on the first point, because, as you said, the games don't even try to hide it. People shouldn't still be asking that question. It's a well known fact to even casual players.  Every new detail I learn about raising cows for food makes me wonder how that's still a thing. Pork and chicken taste better, are better for the environment, and are more profitable.  THANK YOU for pronouncing Kanto correctly. I'm not sure why everyone says "Can-toe." 13:52
13:20 - yes, but how much of that weight is edible and how much is actual mud/earth?
Mudsdale and mudbray weigh a lot because they have heavy solidified mud around their feet.
the fact there is no mention to magikarp sushi kills me. or not. im not a pokemon so im gona be fine. arthur.
"I'm doing a collab with myself" RIP me
So much info I had to subscribe .
What if game theory did a theory on the fact that happy wheels is in a alien invaded world we’re a pink blob thing has stripped people of the ability to walk and is testing them however sometimes they try to get away but the blob has set traps for them and they always go back to being tested in their ability to live on wheels.that would be the day 😀
Says Garchomp, shows Gabite
Wtf
MatPat: said all of this.   Me who can't even bear the heat: now what...
Gonna nitpick here for a second and say that the way he pronounced Skiddo's name made me wince. The rest of the episode was very entertaining and I loved it! But come on. Skid-doo? It's combining "skid" and "kiddo" (kid being a baby goat, and kiddo being a common slang term for a child).  That is all, I am at peace now.
Wy do you waste your time on these ridiculous theories get a life a real one
3:52 “use” is in there twice… noted
Dude I'm surprised he didn't talk about magicarp they literally are shown eating it in the anime
Wy
guys can someone explain further to me what canon means
You should Collab with Magic Spoon to make TheoryO's a real thing!
Missing fish and seafood there
7:35 yo that ain’t a garchomp
Why did matpat shortened his intros?
You tried to eat applin at start of the video. Good worm meal. Applin isn't an apple. It is A WORM IN A APPLE.
Number 11 on trending congratulations food theory
Great, I’m hungry now
Im a vegetarian, good to know that doesnt count..
Im sorry matpat but I like my tauros with a side of oddish not a lum berry
2:53 Chicken:)
God that thumbnail is cursed
Not sure if I would like the taste of Mudbray though.
The pokemom world do have real animals just a fyi, they are just rarely mentioned
Yeah MatPat don't understand pokemon really much... Nurse joy is not and never was a pokemon... That's just like one of that strange theories in the 2000's...
While the hype is still on do a theory about how to win squid game honeycomb candy. Which methods is most effective and if anyone of your crew can complete the challenge
9:55 WHAT THE F-
MatPat: Weird. Its almost like they think through the logistics of this world...  Me: *thinking how they made Onix, a massive 28'10"/8.8 m literal rock snake weight ONLY 463.0 lbs/210.0 kg* MatPat: Nope. Nope. Nevermind. Me: Oh thank god
Gas grill vs charcoal grill vs electric grill
Matt the gamers call the 'Pidgey clones' the regional birds. Kinda offensive ngl
Appletun is pronounced Apple-ton
11:17 wait what
I hope ash's mom doesn't eat her Mr. Mime
3:53 "why do we use use specific animals for food" l like the double use
you cant actually eat applin
Things to say  1.They sell milk tank milk at shops and have them at farms, there aren't for rich people :/  2. Pokemon evolve in the wild by also getting older (in lore, also certaint Pokemon) we can also see this because there are evolved Pokemon in the wild
Y Said dragonite tyranitar and garchomp needs over 10000 steps to hatch but showed pictures of dragonite tyranitar and gabite.
In my opinion, I believe the type of a Pokémon should have been counted for its edibility. I do think all the Pokémon Matt chose were good choices, but let’s say you wanted a meal with a little more natural spice and wanted to do less preparation of your food you would probably splurge a little and get a fire type Pokémon for dinner because of its natural heat and I would assume flavor. All I’m saying is that the type of a Pokémon would probably count for its flavor profile too. But that’s just a comment, a YouTube comment, thanks for reading.
What about bug Pokémon since bugs are more effective protein sources in our world?
I’ve seen enough guro to fear this video
Would it not make more sense for a farmer to have a Milktank farm for the red meat rather than a Mudbray farm? Not only would the farmer be able to raise Milktanks for their meat, but they can also be milked while maturing, giving the farmer an extra source of income.
Now let’s talk taste
he forgot Torchic
well............ my mind is starting to see you in a different light MatPat, but i still love your content
I wanna be the very best eating my wayyyyyyy  Pokemon make it your dieet gotta eat em all gotta eat em all Pokemon
So we need to eat nurse joy?
Idk too much of the later Pokémon but isn’t ur big boy of the bunch only that heavy cuz is partly made or rock? I don’t imagine that would taste good
You know this really video only applies to Americans, right? Not everyone eats such a limited diet
Meat that goats “ provide” you mean they are tortured to death and then you eat their dead body.. they don’t consent. It’s not beneficial to both parties. They are victims whose life was stolen
Are starters scarce due to eating Pokemon ??
*Vegan Teacher would like to know your location*
Um don't mean to discredit Matpat but most of mudstal weight comes from the rock and mud on its body. My estimate is that halve of its weight is in fact mud and rock. Its still a LOT of meat but not as much as you might think.
hoothoot be shaking rn
Wow... Fictional  food. Great content.
Go vegan, real life animals don’t deserve to be murdered for 5 minutes of taste pleasure. Like mat pat said, there are 300000 types of edible plants
That is gabite
7:34 ah yes “garchomp”
Right as the Pokémon Oreos drop...
what
Ohh I did really want a taste of pokemon now i'am hungry
Vegan Teacher just captured that in 4k ultra XD
wait if you eat a fletchinder would it already be coocked
absolutely no relation to the video but that panning sfx from left to right at 12:14, nice.
Vegans watching this
Matt Pat & Food Theory: I love this episode! As an animal scientist, and this topic being my degree, everything in the video basically is perfect. The only thing you need to consider in the real life counterpart and I would’ve added as well is breeds of animals! Otherwise everything else holds up. Just thought that was important to include and hats off to you!
but isnt appletun just the dragon inside the apple?
ASH NO
Does that mean they will have sharkpedo fin soup
LETS GO BRANDON!!!!!!!!!
Pokémon are like animals. humans eat animals.
3:51- typo
I'm a vegetarian, but I would totally eat a Grumpig. I hate the goddamn thing so much
Mat pat doesn’t know aplin is just a worm it can find a new apple xddd
Ok but what about all based on fish? They should be profitable too!
A few people have been pointing out the Hoothoot-is-mainly-carnivorous argument which is true and valid. But there is one other criticism I have and that's that pokemon are magical creatures. What I mean by that is that they live through unexplainable means and are not subject to the same expectations as animals in our world. Notice how he's not recommending a fillet of geodude for example. The thing is, even though it doesn't look like it mudbray falls into that category. The pokedex implies that its diet consists largely of mud and dirt and it is a pure ground type. While there's definitely some organic bits there Matpat was considering it for food because of its weight which is definitely largely composed of packed mud and stone which also at least cover the entirety of its legs. I highly doubt the majority of that weight is actual meat.
Did anyone notice MatPat used a picture of a gabite instead of garchomp at 7:34? As a gaming channel icon, what a sin...
Alternative Title: How to be a farmer!
The issue you're overlooking is availability in certain regions. The Johto-Kanto area has no Skiddo, making their source of milk most likely Miltank or Tauros. Or possibly something like Rapidash. The games even confirm that Johto's Miltank Moomoo milk is exported to Kanto.
Yes but there are a lot of Milbank farms
Matpat: fire up the grill for some toro steaks Me, for some reason: WHY ARE YOU EATING RAY?!?
7:30-7:35 so is anyone gonna tell Matpat that that's not a Garchomp but a Gabite
What about fish? I like my fish, please.
Bgm Soloz
69th video? NOICE!
3:40 I call Miltank and Karpador.
He really said American land is cheap…
Are we not considering bug pokemon?  Protein, plentiful, and something to do with all those zubat.  All those multiple infinities of zubat.
Mega-Metagross is not a legendary...
Gabchomop?
Will you do a theory for WHO IS ASHS FATHER?! or did you already do that?
Thank you for ruining my childhood ^u^
Nice pixel art of mat pat !
I’m sorry little togepi
Hopefully there is a vegan option in the Pokémon world
Why do we use use specific animals for food?
Mistake Here. Pokemon Levels arent comparable to Their age, since we can See old Base Form Mons in the Anime, Like the old treecko.
Thumbnail: You should eat you pokemon! 😀 Me : 👁👄👁
Wait.... Nurse joy is a Pokemon... We eat our Pokemon.......
wouldnt mind eating gardevoir with all my heart though, so yay..
WHAT IS KAAAAAAAANTO its kanto
I love the references
The Goat Simolator Goat from Payday xD
Ok now make what pokemon eats if it doesn't exist
I would rather eat pizza
Mmm tonight im gonna eat some fried nurse Joys
3:40 ah Pokémon unite
MUR-CROW. not MUK-ROW. come on man there is two R's in Murkrow.
I want an outtakes vid! lol
I can’t play Pokémon:(
But, how do the efficient Pokémon taste? If they taste horrible would they even bother farming them?
I feel like there are a few things that weren't considered here. For one, in the milk production Miltank is still going to be the best option. Alpha/Omega pokedex states that it can produce over 5 gallons a day. While not more than a regular dairy cow, they are much smaller at roughly 1/10 the weight.   As for eating meat, the weight doesn't equal a greater food source. For that to be true the muscle mass would scale as well, showing a larger and heavier pokemon. Mudsdale and mudbray are heavy sure, but we don't know if that's muscle, bone, or most likely straight up mud and rocks. Mudsdale and mudbray eat dirt for sustenance as well, meaning that breeding and farming them would be almost impossible, as dirt (unlike grass) doesn't just grow. Even if they are made of meat, they make it from dirt, meaning it would constantly dig out whatever land you had until it was just dead rocks. Not saying there aren't applications to this, just that in terms of food, it seems unlikely. (Also it'd probably taste rank and be incredibly tough)
I’d love some exotic Arceus meat right now.
Matt, you do realize that it’s. Skiddo as in. Kiddo. Because it’s a baby goat. Right?
Huh, never thought Miltank is the least efficient when it comes to farming. Though, that begs the question, are they nutrition enough to be consider 'healthy'?
the only pokemon you cant eat, the ones made out of trash ,metal and magma
what Matpad didn't took into acount is how some pokemon arent available on certain regions, like skidoo only living in kalos or mudsdale in alola, so even thouth the food he choose would be the more eficient, it doesn't mean that people in the Hoen region would be eating hoothoot, if I get my point acroos
Does that mean nurse joy can be eaten got my question answered
There is another factor to this: public safety. For instance; magicarp may not only be useless for other purposes, but eating them when they get big enough prevents the chance that they evolve into gyarados. And fewer gyarados means greater safety for all people and pokemon.
7:33 says Garchomp, shows Gabite... Highly upsetting for me as Garchomp is one of my top favorites. C'mon Prof, get your research together, lol
most people eat *looks down at plate* okay now i just feel called out
Interesting 🤔 However: You're only presenting a rather "western" point of view. Looking at Africa and Asia, you should have also analyzed which Insect-Pokémon would be the best to farm and eat.
Bro I do that without you asking me
bulbasaur! salad, please?
would you eat your dog?      then you answered your own question
Nice now I can eat my Pokémons flèche
game theory: nurse joy is a pokemon food theory: you should eat your pokemon! r34 artists: dont mind if i do.
Raising nurse joys are not worth it they take 18 years before they are ready for slaughter. Silly matpat
The collab thingy in the begining was such a mood
Metagross is not a legendary
V
I have a theory that i would like to be made,  Does an apple a day keeps the doctor awat ?
🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋
10:00 well. you did say almost
Matpat whats the best kind of egg to eat
Eating Pokemon is kinda of a double bladed sword, in one hand most Pokemon are really big, being able to extract a lot of meat, eating more crab and lobster won’t be a problem when kingler and crawdaunt are over 1 meter tall, without mentioning Pokemon plants where really only one can already feed a large number of people, but the problem is that they are very dangerous, they have literal powers so hunting/fishing can be very complicated if you don’t have another Pokemon at your side or even a gun, so domesticating more peaceful Pokemon to breed and eat is the better option
I am relatively certain that the original anime series talked about that tauros and magikarp were regular sources of food
You know that Aplins Apple is not its body so if you ate the apple on alpine body it’s just rude
Me seeing the thumbnail: Yes. Always wanted to try some slowpoke tail
Matpat or ElderPat
Yes they eat pokemon, that's obvious, they farm the ones that look like cows and other animals that provide good meat
1 milotic is enough for me to "eat" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
tbh you can mass farm any Pokemon by having killhouses that convert them to candy to feed to the hatchlings until they fully evolve, and hatch them faster by having machines to shake the eggs in a way that simulates walking
13:53 “…you’re not killing a living animal…”  But you’d still be killing a living thing.  And there are studies that show plants feel pain.  But I guess it makes it easier for vegetarians/vegans to sit on their moral high ground when you can’t hear your food scream.
the only world where being vegan wouldnt be so bad.  ps no shade for the vegans here, ok its a joke.
Every Day,we stray further from god.
what about magikarp and other fish pokemon cuz you shown a picture of a cooked magikarp and what if i want some fish/fishsticks?

Matt Pat, I have a question. In the anime One Piece the Pirate ship the 1000 sunny runs on cola as well as the shipwright, Cyborg Franky. I am curious to know, could you actually power something with cola!?!
If you are a vegetarian, can you eat grass types, since Bulbasaur are both Pokémon and plants?
peta not gonna like this....      I wonder how Mr. Krabs, Aku and HIM taste like!
So…Hoothoot…is the weight of a 10 year old…when it’s born..Dear lord
Farming, Pokemon version
he really took the ruining your childhood catchphrase to heart
Finally a new diet

In South Africa you can eat Ostrich neck in a potjie, with baby carrot and corn on rice
You're telling me I'm paying ten times more for grass-fed beef
Ah no...stop eating animals. This is why we have Sars-Cov19. Zoonotic viruses won't just go away.
Lol
It actually make sense the People eat Magikarp fried or steamed
Nintendo 100%
I mean look at the grocery stores all they have is chicken, pork, turkey, shrimp, lobster and fish. Unless you go to the deli area but who wants to take the time to do that.
Me: *sees title* Umm...! Excuse Me, WHAT?! Matpat, have you gone insane?!🤣
7:34 that's clearly a Gabite
What about for each region specifically? Since not every Pokémon is common in each region I’m curious what the different diets of a unova resident and a kalos resident
The other part that Mattpat misses out in this theory is how easy it is to domesticate and raise these animals otherwise we could be eating Bison, Kangaroos and Blue Whales but none of those animals are easy to domesticate.
Me: *watching this before to store* MatPat: and that’s why you should eat your Pokémon! Me: hmm well I better go to the store! Me (AGAIN): *sees NEW Pokémon Oreos* OOOP
I see issues here for start mudsdale I’d a ground type Pokémon this might make large swafts if it inedible   Like theoretically let’s say duraledon is the most effective source of food, I don’t know about you but eating a skyscraper doesn’t sound particularly nutritious  Maybe you should take typing into consideration avoiding types like, ghost, ground, rock or steel
Of course have you taken into account how much of the animal is edible and what the animal eats. You know the old saying you are what you eat and what you eat affects how you taste and Mudbray eats mud.
Because no one likes that
On the subject of farming pokemon for food,  has anyone given thought to the logistics of actually killing them? Like,  they have powers and can fight back,  so you'd probably have to have them beat each other to death, which means you can't take them to the pokecenter to heal up since that would defeat the purpose...
So rich people eat kids, Nice
food theory, stay in your lane. i love you, but stay in your lane . pokemon belongs to game/film theory
Fun fact: Wailord are less dense than air
Vegans be like 😳
"maybe we'd all be eating Nurse Joy" ......that's what good pu-
only if they´re fresh died corpses are dead, i´m not going to eat my Hoopa!
Ngl after watching this... I want to eat Roasted Hoothoot lol
Hey MatPat! Is Pokémon Go actually Pokémon Hunter? And if so, how filthy rich are we making Professor Willow? With all those transferring that he is paying us with peanuts or rather candy? Also what is the Candy made of?
Um.... we eat Ostrich too, just FYI.
Anyone here named their pokemon as food items?
Ok but you didn't tell about which one was the tastiest Pokemon
My biggest question ever in Pokémon: How do they get protein? Somehow they had to have hunted animals and ate them right?   Me after watching this: I am satisfied.
Wow, never seen a Garchomp that small before o.O
7:35 "like dragonite tyranitar and garchomp" shows dragonite tyranitar and gabite
Matpat: the only things that outweighs it are Legendaries Also Matpat: Shows Mega metagross. 7:34 " Garchomp" Me: Pretty sure that's a gabite...
The Food Theory animation this time brings back some memories
Matpat: Mukrow.  Me: Murkrow. Mur-krow.
I've seen so much of professor's Lando videos yesterday that actually made me smirk when I saw this videos title.
https://youtu.be/SyHiEvkOpK4
i feel this ignores the fact of typing though. its assumed Mudsdale has predominant weight in its fur and legs due to dried clay. so accounting for weight doesnt work for all pokemon. unless the pokemon is labelled as a non material type, material tpes being rock, ground, steel, and ice, it can be assumed most of its weight most likely isnt "edible material". as for other factors if you then want to be realistic a pokemon like wailord, the Float whale pokemon, then also has even less, as its density mostly likely comes from having a massive air bladder and it doesnt have much material to eat either which lines up with its weight to size ratio. HootHoot while its also very heavy, you need to account for the fact by shape, its bones and large eyes make up probably a hefty majority of its body so even with a high weight category as a bird pokemon, probably only half of that would be edible material. finally, you need to account for all these pokemon's diets. we see almost all pokemon eating just standard pokefood, but all pokemon have a dietary restriction of some variety so to feed any "livestock" it would be most efficient to avoid any pokemon that are known to consume other pokemon. this unfortunately rules out alot of the bird pokemon as possible meat sources since many are birds of prey and thusly harder to feed efficiently as well. in the series itself seafood seems to be one of the most common protien sources though there are some red meats as well but they dont seem as prevalent.
Time to get arceus meat
Waiting for Palworld to come out for the next opinion on this matter
Don’t experience just mean yknow experience in combat so it doesn’t really affect a pokemon’s physical growth does it?
My dad keeps saying    ooo that Pokémon would be amazing for a burger   And I’m like you can’t eat Pokémon so we have been wondering if you could eat Pokémon. I guess I was wrong
Sorry, but that’s a gabite…
Can we take a moment to appreciate the Gameboy launch screen at the start of the video
Vegans watching these.... Hahaha
only PRO GAMERS got the gameboy reference
Matpat "We might all end up eating Nurse Joy" Brock : "Yes"
Everyone gangsta till the vegan teacher sees this video
The Ultimate Collab Noone Expected: a Collab of Food Theory and Game Theory
Are we not going to discuss the abundance of seafood that is consumed on the coastal countries? Magikarp has to be a massive industry because of how abundant and easy to farm they are.
That isn’t a garchomp that’s it’s preevolution
Nooo!Those poor pokemon they aren't food!
I'm amazed every time at how much time and effort you put into these videos; and, on top of that, they make me think about things I would've never thought about. Well done again! Easily one of the best channels I watch.
Thanks to MatPat I can now enjoy a lovely roasted torchic.
Don't predatory birds like owls not really have very good tasting meat though?
Mat pat I think you just angered P.E.T.A
Sorry Matt that was Garchomp middle stage
I don’t know if I made the correct Decision clicking this video..
Don't mind me. Just listening to PETA & their supporters rioting in the background. :)
I want the rom hack of today's video intros, R I G H T  N O W
Isn’t it werid how Matt pat counts metagross as a legendary
Why didn't you tell us about what seafood we should eat? Should it be Magikarp or Tentacool? And what about the plants, I mean you never hesitated to ruin our childhoods at film theory so why worry about our morales now?
Might look at eat out menu,  perhaps Gardevoir well done  with a side of Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny to finish 🍣
uhh know this is me being nitpicky but, at 7:35 when you said garchomp, the pokemon on screen is actually gabite its pre evolution
hope matpat don't get demonetized for showing Milktank nipples
idk if mudbray would be that good of a meat source, considering that it's only about 1 meter in height and the pokemon entry talking about them being able to easily support 50 times their own weight, a mudbray would be mainly muscles and the meat would probably be quite hard to chew, not to mention the size would mean not alot of meat from each pokemon
wait land is cheap ?
Sooooooo cannibalism is possible in the form of nurse Joy...? because she's a Pokemon...
私はあきれています。。こんな馬鹿馬鹿しい動画をアップするくらいならもっと健全な動画を作るべきだ。現実にある色んな食材を紹介するなどもっとやり方があるはずなのに！これを見ている世界の健全な子供たちがかわいそうだ。本当に教育に悪いです。
Now my childhood is ded
The veggie question would still be interesting for those of us that regularly eat meat, but could use some more healthy veggies on the side.
I dare you to pin me or Appleton
I'm not convinced that pokemon like Mudbray wouldn't have some sort of dirt or mud flavor in their meat, after all, that's what they eat according to their Bulbapedia entry. It would likely  be a very tough meat as well just based on density (at least it's not rock type), but the weight might also imply that whatever makes earth (+ wet = mud) heavy, gets digested, absorbed and deposited in the body/meat. So I would actually go as far as saying this is probably inedible.
"Maybe we'll just eat Nurse Joy!"  *Brock has entered the chat*
800k watched fictional food,We need thanos now 🙄
Nitpick:  7:37 That is not a Garchomp but a Gabite, the middle form of the evolutionary line.   I love these Pokémon videos, it opens up so much more worldbuilding-wise.
7:36 that’s not a garchomp
I think in the Diamond and Pearl games, there's someone near the library (if memory serves correctly) in the region who tells you that they used to eat Magikarp, then just put the bones back in the stream.
Poke week (:
Does that mean I can eat Nurse Joy?
I never saw a garchomp like that
In the world of pokemon Theres no animals from real life  Sooooooo how did human evolved in the world of pokemon
What the heck would you create a video like this.
Pokemon farm simultor? You mean Pokemon Ranch?
I once ate a ditto once, I remember it like it was yesterday, I said I was so hungry I could eat a human, the guy next to me said "ditto" he clearly wasn't human, so I ate him
"Nurse Joy is actually a Pokemon!"  "Yes, you should eat your pokemon!"  me: *confused screaming* (° ͜ʖ °)  Nurse Joy Simps: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
we can't eat horses or donkeys over here because all beast of burden are protected by law
i can eat tha nurse lessss go
"..., and Garchomp." man that's a gabite smh
"We could all end up eating nurse Joy"  Brock has entered the room.
I should eat my *What Now?*
But what about the few times references to real animals, like when Meowth says "Our goose is cooked", or the fish in tanks in Misty's family run gym? I'm sure there are other references beyond roast chickens that Meowth drools over too
hey mat  tf is wrong with you?
Isn't there a canon pokemon history of humans marrying pokemon? Do a theory on that! like which pokemon species would more likely be married to humans or something idk
Video #17 of telling MatPat that he should do a video on what REALLY happened in that infamous McDonald’s coffee lawsuit.
And 5 star restoranuts probably have shiny meat.
Klinklang is delicious!
Gardevoir I choose you
Seriously thought this was game theory 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
my god  how barbaric  slurp  so how do we cook them which one tastes the best and easiest to procure?
Ever since I’ve watched The Promised Neverland I can’t stop having existential crisises from food videos...
Somewhere on the dark side of the internet, eating your pokemon might mean something else.
69th video    nice
some one send this to vegan teacher
Vore
taRumlüg   Programmierer der Master  K. I.                                                     .
So... we can eat Nurse Joy?
As gruesome as Pokémon may seem regarding people eating them, in many Asian cultures, they consume animals that many of us would regard as pets, so maybe the social aversion to eating a more “sentient” creature compared to ordinary ones has less impact.
And here hearing ppl eat Pokémon in the actual verse was weird enough
There's already a Pokémon farming simulator in the wii
KFC equivalent in the pokemon world would probably be Kanto Fried Combusken
What about  Muslims who can't eat  donkey meat
This videos are getting wierder everyday
This is the 69 th video hahah
medium slow grows faste than medium fast at low levels, so effectiyly medium slow reach maturity quicker
Do you even know your Pokémon I’m gonna be mad
Lets be real this has been canon fpr now 10 years
69 vids
Fun Fact : Those Applins are actually just Bugs that live inside of Ripe Apples that grow on trees, so Mat just basically ate a ripe apple with a bug inside it. Nothing really delicious about that [0:18]
Mandjtv will love this video as it has to do with miltank slaughter
Pokémon sword and shield, quote every time a (Pokémon I forgot) visits a farm a DUBWOOL mysteriously disappears from a farm end quote, they keep dubwool, EVOLVED wooloo.
Why is there a Gabite and not a Garchomp?
I'm surprised this video doesn't take into account the fact that Mudsbray and Mudsdale being SO heavy would seem to indicate that their meat is so dense it's not good to eat Hoothoot might be just a very dense bird, but Mudsbray and Mudsdale's meat are probably dirt-like as their ground type seems to suggest
EPIC VIDEO
Wrong!!!! I worked at Wayne Farms in Pendergrass, GA and it's a known thing that the chicken (in this case, jumbo sized chicken) only live 28 days from hatching to slaughter. So it takes even less time hence probably making all your numbers based off that are wrong lmao
No one calls you the Food Theorist.... You're the Game Theorist
Oh god. Thanks I needed this in my life MatPat.
I don't think anyone would mind eating Nurse Joy. Not me
6:55 this looks so wrong on too many levels
it's not all the parts based on body weight are edible. these efficiency things are invalid. nvm it's just a theory anyways..
Wailord would float like a balloon according to the math
5:48 can I just say how inefficient meat is. 100 calories of beans or grains produces....100 calories. You don’t need to put edible crops through such inefficient middle men to get your nutrients and this is a big reason why meat has such a higher environmental impact than plant based options
mudbray and mudsdale are heavy because theyre covered in mud and clay so theyre not as efficient unless you like dirt and rocks in your mouth.  and if you were to wash all the mud away and chisel of the hardened clay they weigh less and also theyre diet is terrible, why? cause they eat mud.
i was just drawing pokemon, and i see this so i made a steak pokemon you can eat, pretty delicious
I just kinda hoped all humans are vegatarions. Mostly because they evolved besided creature who they could not hunt, so they evolved to only be able to eat fruits and vegtables
Wailord, wtf bro, bowhead whales, which average on about same size, weigh more than 120,000 pounds (54,500 kg). Are they hollow or something?
Technically applin isn't the apple it's the worm inside the apple that is considered the pokemon.
I saw the thumbnail and was like wtf matpat you've finally gone too far
I already know they eat pokemon i wonder that as a kid and I'm traumatize
I'd actually love for you to follow up this episode with the vegitarian/vegan lit diet.  Since there are a lot of pokemon out there that can usually heal or outright disregard losing parts of their bodies and how efficient those would be to farm.  Another fun episode is about the pet industry and what pokemon would be the most likely to be adopted as fully domesticated pets rather than merely caught by trainers.  Though I don't know if that one would be fun to have on this channel...  Oh and on the milk thing, you should take evolutions into account because unlike real life cows many pokemon would be used as guardians for the live stock just as much as they would be used as live stock themselves.  An interesting note is how actually useful these pokemon might turn out to be, base one how many other pokemon seem to carry the treats of being predatorial.
Well... uh... what about the people who are vegan not because the love animals... they hate plants...
Congratulations you have just completed 69 video 😁
dont eat nurses please
Id play a pokemon rom hack where mat pat sends me out to collect "ingredients". Shame i have no idea how to make it happen...
Garchomp: Shows Gabite
I knew from the start that The Food Theorist would probably not be a vegan-friendly channel, but this episode has me screaming.
The problem with mudbray and mudsdale is that they are ground types, which is most likely why they weigh so much. Parts of them are will likely not be edible
and vegetarians could harvest the bananas off tropius's neck :)
7:35 shame on you editors you showed a pic of gabite instead
I would eat guardevoir any time
matpat: *mentions mudsdale* me: :0 my most favorite pokemon musdale is heavier than the big whale pokemon :0 those are faqcts that are interesting also matpat: *says something that means mudbray can be eaten* me: WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE CUTE SMOLL MUDBRAYYYY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I have no idea why I watched this video as a vegan. 😅
Eat nurse Joy? Poor choice of words😂
Don't let That Vegan Teacher see this video...
Dam probably tastes busing busing
He’s next going to make a theory on why you should explode homes
Pokemon go users: “I’m sorry little one…”
I think you also need to consider size & elemental types of each Pokémon. As clearly snorlax & wailord would be made of fats, then a skinny donkey that weights more then a full grown Pokémon cow or bull might not actually have a lot of meat on it after all
Eating Nurse Joy? Brock liked that
Do a Pokemon film theory that way you'll have a Pokemon theory on three channels
Even more efficient than poultry are insects. Caterpie, I choose you!
Oh god imagine slaughtering a legendary Pokémon for food
there's no way hoothoot would taste any good.. feels not too different from eating our overweight house cats. 🤔
That's not Garchomp
The vegan teacher is quakeing lol
Krabby Patties Now made with real Krabbies!
How is beef cheaper to raise then pork but cost way more smh
you used Gabite instead of Garchomp - please edit!!!!
yh but apple has a worm in it so eating 1 of them your eating the worm aswell (or maybe just the worm cause I think its the worm that's the actual pokemon n the apple is just a 'shell' like dwebbles rock its been seen to not have a shell in the show and use a deposed can on the beach as its shell instead of a rock)
What about ponyta
I'm a little disappointed I was rly thinking u would come to the conclusion that insect Pokemon are the most efficient protein source. I mean honestly this things are giants and they hatch like crazy.
I grow mealworms. They’re higher in protein and cheaper to grow. Taste great in chilli con carne.
i would like to offer a rebuttal that mudbrey/mudsdale are the best meat source. one thing that MatPat didnt take account for is why they weigh so much. the pokedex say that mudbrey are covered in dirt and mud all the time and Mudsdale can get big chunks of earth and road stuck to it while walking. this would account for why they are both so heavy. from pokemon sword's pokedex: "Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale's legs sets harder than stone. It's so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick."
What makes this worse is that YouTube decided to give me a pokemon ad in the start of the video....
Your combining Pokémon AND Food, my two fav things. Now your cooking with, um, charizard?
But would they eat the humanoid-looking pokemon like Mr. Mime, Jynx, Machoke, Machamp, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, etc...
Obviously yall have never seen that anime based on 2 guys goin around the world discovering the best food and how to cook it to its full potential to level the fighters up to fight bigger food...
So we just gonna ignore Blaziken the actual chicken?
To everyone who is reading this:  You are beautiful! ❤
Well this is Stupid
Hey MatPat and crew, love y'all. Don't you ever EVER show that weird milking graphic again. Dear God.
Now can be the best time to buy and  hold Bitcoin because  surely  it will come up to a standard  rate
I know legendaries we're off the table but I could see someone like Giovanni or the other team leaders eating a legendary bird lol
_Me clicking on this at 3am_ "Hmm interesting"
Hey matpat that’s a gabite not a garchomp
also the matter of Chansey Eggs, which are canonically something people eat as well (they're a curry ingredient in SwSh, alongside Sausage, Fried Food, Precooked Burger, and Smoke-Poke Tails.)  Also, according to Smoke-Poke Tail's description in SwSh, Slowpoke tails just... fall off? They don't need to be cut because they're apparently constantly shedding them. They grow back too. (Maybe Slowpoke is actually an Axolotl? That's a theory for you.)  And that's not counting grass type pokemon that actually grow fruit on their bodies, like Tropius.
If Nintendo takes this down, it's canon.
Canyou use normal units or at least put the number there. No one in the world know what a pound is.
"Fetchling" "Pie dove"
7:35 If you know, you know
What about you eat something healthy like best combination of salad 🥗
But that's cannabilsm
Inb4 Nurse Joy's milk is selling for $500 a jug for the 1%
I just hope no one in the Pokemon world would attempt to est a zubat...
2:52-No eggs?
Owo I hope I can eat nurse joy ;)
Tbh the more you think about it the less messed up it becomes
I never knew I needed answer of a question I always wondered.
How i think some pokemon would taste:  Charmander: very VERY spicy  Squirtle: kinda like jelly, but bitter Pikachu: battery acid (not edible tho)  Evee: cinnamon and honey Meowth: juicy steak
I for one could go for some yummy Zubat soup.  =3
hoothoot is conveniently a drumstick already
He showed nurse joy as a human in this vid but THE PERSON HE COLABED WITH MADE AN VIDEO THAT NURSE JOY IS A POKEMON THAT MEANS SHE NEED TO BE EATEN
I rather always eat eggs and milk and more vegetables than eating actual meat
now matpat, where does moomoo milk come from
Would farming count as putting Pokemon in a Daycare?
As a person who likes vegetarian food just because I like to eat them and not because of guilt of eating non veg food(I am non veg, I just like veg food too) , I definitely want to know about plant-based Pokémon
:O I can't believe matpat's collaborating with matpat this is such an insane Collab
No way pleaseeee
I love how MatPat made an episode about Nurse Joy is a PokéMon (GameTheory Channel) Then this.I'd like to think that Nurse Joy can be eaten. (Don't get the other way around)
Matpat: You may be able to eat nurse Joy!  Brock: yes
7:38 That’s a Gabite, not a Garchomp
7:37 That's not a Garchomp that's a Gabite
DAMMIT
Wouldn't eating a Pokémon be like eating a cat or a dog?
Watch underverse and talk about it
I thought you said no evolutions
MatPat, there is one thing about Pokemon and it's that they fight, hard. I don't see Hoot-hoot being an easy livestock if they have psychic powers. And why Slowpoke tails are easily obtain is due to the slow witted nature of the Pokemon despite having Psychic powers. Trying to agitate that Mudsdale that can know Bulldoze and Earthquake is not gonna be easy.
A large part of the weight on Mudbray I think is the mud that cakes it's legs. At least that's my suspicion
How do you make these theories?
Yep he got rid of the Food Theory intro
paterz approves of eating pokemon and already made a tier list of good pokemon to eat
The best example of this would be Magikarp
:{ }
As far as eating Mudbray and Mudsdale go, it probably wouldn’t taste great. Not only are they working Pokémon, so their meat would probably be tough, but their diet also consists mostly of dirt. Also worth noting that the (inedible) mud that coats their bodies is probably factored into their weight.
he out gabite instead of garchomp
B-But, every region is different. Not every region has easy access to every pokemon.
12:47 "The only things that outlass it in weight are legendaries" *proceeds to show a mega Metagross*
Matpat you have a psychic cuz last night I'm having a though because of what do they eat in Pokemon
Ew I don't wanna eat goat milk ice cream, it would be pretty bad I reckon
This video is  perfect timing as my dnd group has been joking about eating pokemon.
You were so concerned with whether you could, it never occurred to you to think if you should
The one sort of problem with this is that it ignores regions. each of these pokemon are from different regions. now you might say they can be imported around but, then we wouldn't need a national dex to get old pokemon. importantly even in the real world cows and chickens aren't neccesarily the same across countries, let alone continents.
Okay, but you said Garchomp, and that was clearly Gabite. Very disappoint.
Game theory: Nurse Joy is a pokemon Food theory: You should eat your pokemon *I dont like where this is going...*
A lot of these Pokemon are region specific though, a person from Johto or Kanto, probably wouldn't be eating Mudbray. If we're talking in terms of efficiency, we need to think of regional/domestic availability as well. Which for both Kanto and Johto would be Magikarp, due to how abundant it is in those regions. For other regions it'd be something else, but again we can't ignore regional availability.
There's a flaw in your thinking. Yes Mudbray is very heavy, but where is that weight coming from? It can't be muscle mass because it's a fairly lean pokemon, so surely that weight has to come from density, likely its bone density . Also taking into account it's a ground type pokemon, it and Mudsdale's meat is probably earthy if not tough, generally. It's odd how in figuring out what the people in Pokemon it, you didn't factor things like taste and edibility which should be the first factor in all this. Given everything i said, i think the most suitable options are simply Tauros and bouffalant. Considering they're both normal type, their meat shouldn't be affected by any odd typing and their meat should be easily assessable.
Yes, "why do we use use pokemon for food"
Skid-doo? It's a pun on "kid," like a baby goat. It's s-kiddo..
But doesn’t part of a pokemon’s weight come from Bone density??? Based on the height of Mudbray it is far more likely that a lot of that excess weight comes from its skeleton than its rump steak
now its time for you to consider which industry would have changed drastically due to pokemon farming. For example, would mining industry be the same considering many pokemon that can dig? What about power company? would producing electricity from coal/gas/oil etc be more efficient than farming electricity pokemon? so many questions!
Man these intros are just getting better every time.😁
DO I EAT NURSE JOY
Vegan teacher be like 😠
the apple is not part of applin or flapple he also said skiddo wrong the whole time
The intro: but applin do. Applin is just the worm inside the apple
Mudsdale meat would prob be tough tho cause I imagine all that weight comes from the fact that their bodies r super dense
Ratata. So common the size wouldn't be an issue
I'm going to go out on a limb after watching 3-1/2 minutes of this and deem Snorlax the best Pokéfood.  Well, at least it was mentioned -- but not really a contender!
Gabite instead of garchomp
I can only I'm the vegan teacher watching this and wanting to throw her laptop out the window xd
I wonder if vegan on pokemon feeling conflicted eating veggy afraid it the pokemon they eating
But the question is, which pokemon is the most edible?
Wait.. u made another pokemon vid 12 hrs ago and THIS IS 12 HOURS AGO....
So I’m assuming in Kanto though you’d be stuck with Tauros steak and magikarp meat though
OK, so I should eat the owl and the donkey, gotcha
why i'll go vegetarian from now on=
What the heck is a Fetchling?
“Beef is actually one of the most profitable animals for farmers to raise” 🥩  4:31
7:38 That Pokemon on the far right is a Gabite, Gibles' second evolution to Garchomp.
Mudbray is heavy cuz its made of mud. Gross to eat
anyone else notice that "Garchomp" at 7:34
This doesn't take into account the calories in vs calories out because some of these animals like Hoothoot/Noctowl are likely carnivorous.  Also weight of Pokemon doesn't translate directly into calories of meat on the Pokemon because the weight might be primarily bone especially in the case of Pokemon like Mudsdale and Mudsbray
Mat : ...And Garchomp  **Editor Shows Gabite**
I feel like Pokemon's types should be taken into consideration. I mean, wouldn't ground types taste like dirt? Wouldn't rock/steel types be too hard to eat? Wouldn't poison/fire/electric types be too dangerous to eat. Wouldn't ice types be too cold to eat?  Also a lot of Pokemon are able to breed right after hatching out of an egg (in the games anyway) so if there mature enough to breed wouldn't they also be mature enough for slaughter?  Also, Also, you did not even mention fish Pokemon.
I guess Mudbray and Mudsdale would be the winner... if you don't mind all that weight being dense mineral deposits? There's a reason they weigh so much... They literally eat mud, and are made of the stuff...   Did you actually read the pokedex, Matpat?
Eating an appletun alive is scary...
You know what, i'll eat nurse Joy.
Sure thats a tiny part of it. The animals we eat are mostly becuz they are the right combination to be domesticated. A pig cant leap over a fence like a deer. Horses have a family structure were they accept humans as a funny looking horse. Zebra live in a group but its everyone for themselves. Chickens reproduce and mature quickly. Elephants yale decades to grow and reproduce. It takes a special combination of traits that make an animal domesticated. And its rare that an animal has all of them.
Oh I'd love to eat nurse Joy
sir that is gabite, not garchomp
According to food theory Garchomp = Gabite
These pronunciations are going to be the death of me
pokemon is a thing which would fit in game theory and film theory and food theory. XD
Did— Did this dude just call Murkrow Mukrow?
while mudsbray and mudsdale are really hefty pokemon as is apparent by pokedex, but i feel like matpat did not take into account all the mud and dirt that these pokemon have on them, which is quite a lot i feel like
No
:
The local theorist.
Wait, while Milktank does grow slower, it produces quite a lot of milk and quite regularly... plus, different regions have different Pokemon...   And what about resources needed to grow the food??? There are many factors other than just growth speed...
7:37  “”And garchomp”  *proceeds to put gabite instead*  🤦‍♂️
congratualtions mat. this is your 69th food theory video
Definitely a fact , can’t let them die for nothing
owls are carnivores which would make hoot hoot less efficient than a grain eating bird.
wait wait wait.... if nurse joy is a pokemon then does that mean.... she eats of the remains of the pokemon that she's supposed to save????  oh my.... (@_@)
Man, the way you pronounce some of the Pokemon's names is just horrible.
Noooooooooo my childhood is now dead
Mudbray: ??? Me: Congratz, Mudbray, u've just won an award. Now Run, for your life depends on it ._.
Ok. I'm not eating Nurse Joy
Since you mentioned poultry being the cheapest efficient meat source I would be interested in your take on using insects as a substitute for meat. There are a lot of people who say that you can get a lot of the same nutrients from bugs but bugs dont require as much water or space. Are bugs the cheap sustainable future of meat or is it all talk.?
YES OFFICER HIM, HE WANTS TO EAT PIKACHU
ahhh. childhood ruined again.
Remember when you said garchomp matpat you put a picture Gabite
Yeah, when I was younger, I saw Ash eating burgers with meat and kinda just figured that it was the cow Pokémon from gen 2
THE DREAM MUSIC DISC IS THERE AGAIN!!! but when talking about the wailord it then changed to different music and later change back, WHAT IS THE SONG?????
When Applin isn't really the apple
I thought this was game theory....
Thank you so much for this information Mat, now I know that having vaporeon as sushi is actually a good thing.
Up next week
applin is not the apple... i think
lol this was made today
Matpat is a monster, eating that Applin. He could've just eaten the apple it lived in, but he ate the creature too. Evil.
If humans are pokemon can you eat...
Pokemon farm is a game
You can’t eat owls as they are toxic…
Matpat, You should have included Pokemon rarity, as well as capture rates. Cause if a Pokemon is hard to get your hands on, it wouldn't be worth trying to raise as cattle. And if it's a rare Pokemon, it probably doesn't breed much, meaning it wouldn't be efficient to raise as much as other Pokemon. I'd say that there are probably a lot of factors like these that you missed. Anyways, looking forward to a future video will you go over this again with even more data and evidence! Keep up the good content
DISCREPTENCY DETECTED! at roughly 7:25 you said that 1280 is a 5th of 5120, its actually a 4th =P
Never have I watched a Pokemon show. Never have I played the games. Never have I owned a card. Never have I ever wanted to. And yet, I watch. I watch, squandering my life away. Take this as a testament to your entertainment value
Wtf happened to theories 💀
Do to owls being carnivores they would cost more to raise. The best "bird" Pokémon would be Pysduck same exp. rate and only 3 pounds lighter. While duck are omnivores making feeding cheaper.
i dont think hoothoot would taste good.. its an owl right. predator birds eat meat. so their meat would be quite bad. seed eating pokemon would be better. horse would be not great meat. but i guess that one is okish
0:00 GENERAL KENOBI
MatPat wants to eat nurse joy confirmed!
Mat saying “Mukrow” instead of Murkrow @11:17 made me seethe inside. That being said very thankful for Pokemon theories and his work in general! Also where is the Rick and Morty series finale theory I’m so excited for!?
MatPat I am sorry but you are not making me eat meh Jolteon
how about eating pokemon seafoods/fish?
I wouldn't mind eating Gardevoir.
Funny how this means that the efficient foods of our world would have luxury status equivalents in Pokémon. Kalos Fried Combusken, Miltank Moo Moo Milk and Pignite Rashers.
Pokemon got’a eat em all
7:34 Errr Matpat that's a Gabite, not a Garchomp. It's the pre-evolution of it.
Matpat! You disappoint me! You went by Pokemon weight, but didn't even consider how much of that Pokemon's body is actually meat, or the Pokemon's diet. Mudbray, for instance... Part of what makes it heavier is that it's diet consists of dirt, and part of it's body is coated in mud. Even after you have cleaned the mud off the outside, the sitting mud in it's body is still heavy, and would have to be cleaned out. Meaning Mudbray may not be the most efficient red meat source in the Pokemon world after all... And you, of all people, should have taken that into account.
Cannabalism
Ngl when you were naming all the bird pokemon I got nervous for a moment as my fav wasnt on that list and yet it fell in the categories you mentioned so I thought you were going to say it won, thankfully I remembered my wingull is very small and unlikely a good good source however it does grow up fast and evolves into pelliper which is probs more bill than leg lol
YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT POKEMON
Here's in my mind how they taste and or what they give you. What two types would you mix and why? Normal= just the regular animal Fire= spicy + high vitamin d Water= juicy + medium vitamin c Grass= natural + low overall vitamin  Electric= tangy + high  caffeine  Ground= tough + medium protein Rock= crunchy + low protein and iron Steel= tough + high iron Dragon=  sour + high human growth hormone  Ghost= sour + medium antibiotics  Fairy= sweet + medium serotonin  Dark= sour + medium melatonin Fighting= savory + low protein and serotonin
BRUH
https://youtu.be/uk-WqKMdgZc
This episode went dark hella fast
Matpat: Garchomp Image:  Gabite lmao
Umm 🐱 EAT 🙀
Because no one else said it.... I'D EAT ME SOME NURSE JOY! HEYOOOOOO!!!
Cursed thumbnail
Miltank(or how ever you spell it) is basically a cow, definitely just a bunch of burgers
So we are okay eating 'children' as long as they arent human 🤣
Colabing with your self is normal i think
That’s not garchomp =_=
7:35 nice garchomp man
Why would you eat those precious creatures when humans exist. They are eatable enough stop killing pokemon >:(
about evolution how about evolution stones or exp candies how do u know that the pokiefarmers if i may dont  use these too there advantige
I told my friends if There’s no other animal in the pokeworld then they eat pokemon
One nitpick here: Being in cattle country one thing you got wrong is the farmers don't water the pasture. That would actually be quite dumb, most of the water used actually is drinking water for the cattle, the pastures are all native grass. and weeds which flourish without any assistance.
7:33 and garchomp “puts a picture of gabite”
Danny phantom
Hold on. Ain't nobody eating an owl. Sorry bro. Hoot Hoot Thanksgiving is all you.
Ok so we’re not taking into account evolutions but we’re worried about EXP growth rates? Matt you do know most Pokémon evolve via EXP right? Then there is there actual growth which is not at all tied into their level. If we’re not counting evolutions then growth rates don’t matter. Miltank would most likely be the best to raise as food since they have no evolution and they don’t have to be pregnant to produce milk. (Which is also high in nutrients by it self.)
Anyone else get the “Nurse Joy is a Pokémon” recommendation before this video >.>
11 hour also if you should eat them and nurse joy is Pokémon…… NO
applin is a bug, not the apple
Imagine catching legendaries just to eat it.
So, we could eat nurse joy?
Metagross isn’t a legendary
12:48 guys mega metagross is a legendary confirmed
Yu monnster😭🤣😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂🤦‍♂️Sorry
Creepy Fact: Pokémon are the only living animal so the food ash and his friends eat are Pokémon
Should have had the Game Theory be something different and left the Nurse Joy as Film Theory as it's mostly anime.
I’d eat nurse joy.
There was a passage in Ruby/Saphire /Emerald where they were talking about eating tentacool or something. It really shocked me.
someone answered the question on how people on pokemon get their food
0:36 Wait... game theory is a she!?
Love from India 🇮🇳 ♥
dude..... I an gonna eat a cosmoem right now it look tasty.Ha.It will be soo tasty
People who disliked the video have eaten Pokemon other than the ones in the video
Waiting for Patterrz to comment about Wooloo.
Sir that garchomp is a gabite
WHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY
69th vid?
Anyone else miss playing Pokémon on the DS? Good times
So mat pat said we should eat our pokemon. He also said that nurse Joy is a pokemon🤔🤔🤔🤔
Squirtle Soup
That Vegan Teacher would hate this
There are Pokémon that literally look like ice cream.  But then there are others that look like garbage.
Mudsdale is probably not very good meat. I doubt people would eat it being that dense
Food Theory idea: does Soda in a tin can taste different from Soda in a plastic/glass bottle.
Nurse Joy is a clone
So by definition all Pokemon characters are cannibals
what about the miltank farm in gold/silver? and all the moomoo milk
Wait wait wait... are you saying I can eat Jessy and James friend: meowth... justifiably?
What if Hoothoot tastes bad?
Based solely off of the uploads... You want to eat Nurse Joy?
666 dislikes...
There are real animals in the Pokémon world
Yum
Neat.
There are some factors you didn't take into account such as taste, and the fact that most predators are not good for food
what about Magicarp??
BDG stated who’s the most delicious pokemon. It’s Togepi
No, Farfetch'd was not hunted to the point of extinction. It was hunted to the point of becoming an endangered species. Not remotely the same thing.
one thing that might have been worth factoring in, or worth another episode, especially with the plant pokemon, is those that can simply regrow the harvested parts. the fruit on tropius for example, and slowpoke tails both regrow. also the potential lifespan is another factor overlooked. for all we know miltank may be much longer lived and able to produce more dairy throughout their lifespan than a gogoat. Also biggest thing to consider in my opinion is the 3-5 year growing time to begin with. this is actually due to the mad cow epidemic and FDA regulations as a result. prior to this, you could often get beef from cows in excess of 10 years of age. the entire industry had to shift due to the fallout from mad cow disease.
when i clicked on this video i got a ad about cooking chicken
matpat that wasn't garchomp
Uh... matpat? You got mixed up between gabite and garchomp....
We know who nurse joy's husband eats every day
Pokémon vegan teacher coming for you
pigs cost a buck and 69  haha
"Eating Nurse Joy"  Man my mind is messing with me
charizard shwarma roll
I want to eat Gardevoir 😈
Lowkey want to eat gardevior
I think the other thing we need to know is how much milk we get per miltank. Yes they take more experience to level up but what's the yield we're getting per miltank vs what we'd get from a skiddo?
Some guy: “There can’t be something that MatPat finds that’s darker than FNA—“  MatPat posting this video: *”ArE yOu SuRe AbOuT tHaT!?!?*
6:35 this is exactly why I hate milktank so much...
I looked at the title for 5 seconds and said “hmm okay”
Eating nurse Joy? Who gave Brock the pen after mat fell asleep 😂
https://youtu.be/Jw3eq33c9qU
Mmmmmghm horse meat
Poggers of The highest degree
LOVE FROM INDIA
Mat pat is saying that they eat pokemon here and in game theory he is saying pokemons are human so that means the pokemon world supports cannibalism
3:34 welp time to eat my best pokémon
Nurse joy is a Pokémon! *consumes her*
just gonna bet magicrap will be the most commonly eaten, that and zubutts
But it’s so cute I wanna bedT
Whenever you smack your lips in a bit I remember how you had your wife lie to everyone on a video about having misophonia.
Matpat showed a Gabite, not a Garchomp.
Fun fact: wailord can fly
Mmmmm fired picky peck
consolidated pokémon theories today: Eat Nurse joy as it is a pokémon like you do in we happy few.
You call them Pidgey clones... meanwhile Pokemon fans call them the starting bird, you got the starting "rodent" as some like Bunelby aren't actually rodents, starting bugs, cat/dog as not every region has one or the other. I think the only ones called clones are Pika clones, most likely because that's their only purpose and very few people care about the other electric rodents. Meanwhile starting birds, bugs, etc have varied in value and popularity.
I didnt understand why it was a bad thing koffing being a poison gas pkmn
I don't believe Mudbray would be the best option to eat as most of its weight would be mud/dirt. One thing @TheFoodTheorist should keep in mind is what parts and how much of the pokemon would actually be edible. A great example would be Magikarp, as in the anime they're know to reproduce quickly but are extremely bone
"Do people in the Pokemon world eat Pokemon"  "What would be the tastiest Pokemon"  Who asks this stuff?!
It's all fun and games untill your factory is destroyed on day 1 by rampaging giant  horses and any staff are hypnotised by psycic owls
Pokemon are not actually eaten even if they can people Pokemon put up too much of a fight
Edit: I’ll leave this, but I’m sure you have better things to do than read complaints about tiny errors.  This has probably been pointed out already,  but when you mention Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp, there’s a Gabite picture instead.  Also it’s Murkrow, with an ‘R’ on both sides of the ‘K’, not Mukrow.
I think the early game bird pokemon are called regional birds (at least that's what my friends and I think)
... HOW DARE YOU, Relicanth caviar, no one in the world is making Coelacanth Caviar, it is a living fossil and protected species, living in the depths of our oceans... Also garchomp... Mat Pat you, your editors, or both don't know Pokemon if you're calling Gabite Garchomp.
he put a gabite picture instead of a garchomp picture when giving comparisons for step counts to hatch a pseudo legendary pokemon
Imagine being a vegen when even veggies are pokemon
I’d rather die than eat my magikarp
Pseudou Legendary would be a delicacy
What about seafood?
I wanna eat nurse joy...  (≖ ͜ʖ≖)
Lamb is on the same level as caviar??? Maybe its a regional thing, but Lamb is consumed by most average people. Though I think lamb isn't just lamb, its sheep as well... but I just assumed "lamb" meant sheep everywhere in the world.
https://youtu.be/f1uEBIZykms  #thankmas
The gameboy edit is fire
Nurse joy is a pokemon! *Shows the nurse joy's picture as a civilian*
U think Pokémon is food and u think nurse joy Pokémon  🤨
It’s like saying... it’s okay eat your dogs... in that earth-universe they eat animals, dogs are animals that means “ YOU SHOULD EAT UR DOGS” bruh...
Thinking about where all your pokemon you send back to professor Oak gone, this's probably the answer.
miltank is flippin delicious my guy
Gabite in the place of Garchomp Pokemom in the Anime has pokemon evolving without battles, also exp candies rare candies, catching pokemon in the let's go is exp without battling and daycares for free exp
Hold it right there MatPat I hate to call you out like this but this is bothering me. If these Pokémon are so good for eating then how are there a tun of them in the wild. As I played the games I see Pokémon like that in farms sure but I go to the other end of the map and they are just like the Zubat in Mt.moon in Gen 1 in other words they are everywhere you can say farmers go that far to get those Pokémon but in the real world walking there is very dangerous with all the LV. 49 Pokémon with your farm LV.26 Pokémon.even by car a Pokémon can still really hurt you. So that’s not happening so I think Pokémon are only for battles and not much else.
The "Pidgey clones" have a name, it's "regional birds"
So... How, exactly does curry work in the Pokemon universe? Like, you can throw any berries into a pot and get brown curry and rice from that. Even pokemon journeys semi-addresses how ridiculous it is. How da heck, bro? It would make cooking a lot easier for me if that was how it worked irl. 😑
I think we all know most would prefer a mouth full of Lucario's meat to round out their day.
Milktank could milk its self
I don't think mudbray would make for good eating considering it's size to its weight it's meat would be very dense making it both hard to cook and hard to eat.
Still waiting for OFFICIAL game theory cereal I’ll eat that for 10 years straight
When anyone ask "do people eat pokemon?"  I think of the moment Ask eat meat
MatPat: "Like Dragonite, Tyranitar and Garchomp" Also MatPat: *shows Dragonite, Tyranitar and Gabite*
I love living in a fishing town, oysters, catfish, crabs , all of the good things . I don't eat pork due to religious reasons . And I raise chickens , but only for the eggs . Beef is usually only in tacos and burritos and such .
Morbid bruh
you can eat an Applin's apple because it's a Wyrm in a Apple and go ahead and try eating the dragon and the apple I'll wait
Time to eat my raichu
7:35  Mat: Dragonnite, tyranitar, and garchomp Also Mat: shows a gabite
Vore
Brian David Gilbert sheds a single tear watching this from gaming heaven.  We miss you Bro. 😪
Matt pat and most of the comunity fail to asses something that the game straight up shove in our face and is part of the plot of gen 2: pokemon eggs are an anomaly. Its a rare and recent development in the pokemon world,and is safe to assume that most pokemon in the wild have similar birth biology to their animal counterparts.
You know aplands just the worm right you could just pick a normal Apple you insane maniac
Didn't Austin do a whole video on how a Wailord would float
Matt patt: 6:28 R34 artist: "write that down...write that down"
People have done a can you eat Pokemon theory before, my 1st was Dookieshed but it wasn't just a can you eat Pokemon it was top 10 he would eat, no questions asked. That being said, props on taking it further and saying we should eat Pokemon, as much as I like Torchic... yeah I love chicken it's delicious, and it's fire type so it can cook itself.
Most Pokemon could be eaten if you try? *Uses [INFORMATION EXPUNGED] to acquire Arceus steak* I wonder what this tastes like? ... I have seen everything and nothing!!! *Initiates permanent coma*
I don't know, Mat Pat, maybe you should have accounted for how different the regions are, I can't imagine Unova would have the same diet as Alola. And not to mention, Mudsdale is a ground type pokemon, I'm not saying that means is made out of dirt, but he could.
Bro you can't eat owls bro they taste bad
Woa woa woa, Stop! HootHoot! Are you serious? Owls are renown for lacking meat. In fact Native Americans refuse to hunt them because it's not worth it. Look at owls without feathers, they're basically skin and bone. Most of their mass is feathers so it makes no sense to farm them for meat
.....uh.....that's not a garchomp
So IRL donkeys are largely used as labor animals, and we know that in Pokémon they use their Pokémon for all kinds of labor. Mudbray is also a ground type that eats dirt, and it says in the Pokédex entry from Ultra Moon that it can be loaded with 50 times it’s own body weight. So in essence Mudbray is the perfect reason why people in the Pokémon universe SHOULD be eating plants instead of Pokémon. It’s a farm animal that can do all of digging and replanting of crops on its own you would just have to have it eat dirt loaded with seeds, and defecate in either where it previously ate dirt, or even the same plot of land. And then the dirt is nourished much like a worm processing compost, and you save money on feed because your seeds are going directly back into the ground. And you could use those same Mudbrays to harvest the crops once growing season is done.
Welp now you have ruined my childhood twice in one day.
My grandpas education literally involved farming.  He still has the books from high school and before.  He knows how much feed will last a cow for how long and how many seeds you’d need for a specific yield. .. if shtf I really hope he’s around when it does lol
peking duck Farfetch'd，it even has its own onion lol
matpat's editors: accidentally puts a gabite instead of a garchomp comments section: WHWHHHHWHHHHHWHH
what about fishes i mean there seems to be large large sources of water in every region and i want to know will magikarp be good , its in every region ( its stated that they have a thick covering meowth lost its teeth trying to eat it ) or if regional fishes be better
so we gons even eat nurse joy now?
You do know mudbray mudstale are so heaven cuz of rocks right? They could be 100 kilos and 30 kilos
Why do we use use specific pokemon for food
im about to munch down on some living breathing mewtwo
I think this episode is gonna be in a social studies class
Applin doesn't grow on trees. The actual Pokémon is the worm, the apple is just an apple.
Check out farcetch’d.  That was literally the first one. I remember that episode.  I used it to break my little friends dreams
Bruh the giant pumpkin I saw an the pumpkin patch weighed twice as much as that whale!
Imagine an advertisement that says: POKÉMON now in multiple flavors 🤣
What in the matpat
I love that gameboy advance intro
7:34 Mat I think that is a gabite
Fish though....
But owls are carnivores. Their meat will taste pretty rough
I enter this video with guilt after getting a Pokémon movie ad
Mat pat has started a farm in pokemon world
My Personal Pokémon Farming Simulator. Oh I can just hear it now. Markiplier will be racking this one up on his list of simulator games soon enough!
Well, Mat's finally lost it!
fun fact: they actually farm plants like wheat for proof look at the episode where they run into a snorlax in a town river from the o.g. show
7:34 Yup, that's totally a Garchomp right there, nothing wrong right there whatsoever...  As for the meat sources and whatnot, you forgot something massively important, the weight INCLUDES the hide and bones (and for Mudsdale/Mudbray the dried mud on their bodies), so the actual meat is FAR lower than that. Also, experience groups only really matter IF you level things up to lv100 (or anywhere high), since for example, Erratic (600000 exp) need more experience in lower levels than Fluctuating (1640000 exp) ones do when counting lv1-45, so depending on the level you plan to get the Pokemon at before "harvesting" the meat from them, you might even need to go with entirely different Experience Groups (eg: most efficient for lv1-20 is Flunctuating, lv20-29 is Medium Slow, lv30-71 is Fast, lv71+ is Erratic and yes, Fast and Erratic are exactly the same at lv71).  PS: As for vegans, you completely forgot the fact berries exist lol
We all know gardevoir is best to milk ;)
HOOT HOOT SO CHONKY
YOU FORGOT FISH AAAAAA
Honestly, I think the reason Mudbray and Mudsdale are so heavy is because of all the mud they cover themselves in. Although they do have to be strong to move with all that on them.
I love the idea of a vegetarian in Pokemon deciding that Tangela would make for a good salad.
Has no one pointed out that when matpat talked about the psuedo-legendaries he says garvhomp but the imagine shown was Gabite? Cuz like that's annoying me
The title mad sus tho
MattPat tries to eat fictional Pokemon animals from a video game. It's not very effective. Billyyank tries to eat a sandwich. It's super effective.
Matpat: "You should eat Pokemon" Also Matpat: "Nurse Joy is a Pokemon"  If you say so ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Pokemon Edibility is not a novel concept" - Brian David Gilbert (Unraveled circa '20)
7:38 definite tyranitar and garchomp a yes garchomp is actually gabite
Aren't Pokémon sentient? Also, this was horrifying. T-T
Matpat "We might all end up eating Nurse Joy" Brock : "Yes"
I wouldn’t eat mudbray… probably tastes like… mud. Birds and cattle make much more sense. The non elemental ones.
tasty. mmm
So, animals are just feed to meat convertors?
Do you think the reason we don’t see or hear the idea of eating Pokémon in modern Pokémon (besides the obvious idea that they don’t want kids having the idea of eating cute animals) is because it’s not a norm anymore?  As time goes on, I like to think that the majority of the people start looking at their Pokémon more as a friend and companion rather than food. So, over the years, eating Pokémon became a less appetizing thought. What would they do to replace protein? They can still get dairy from Miltank and Skiddo, and fruits and veg normally, but protein is still the problem. Maybe just eggs? That could be the one thing that is still ok and acceptable to eat, Pokémon eggs. Idk….  Also the Applin and Appletun thing? Sure we could say that we eat them and skin Appletun….but taking a nicer approach, we really just eat the apple the Applin in living in, or just leave it alone.  In the game Sword and Shield, I’m pretty sure it said Applin produce the sweetest of sweet nectars/honey. So you could just raise a bunch of Applin for their apples (since I have to assume they only use the sweetest of apples) and the nectar they produce.  Appletun, I like to believe, sheds it’s skin that must be very similar to like a sweet apple flavored pastry dough, and kids could follow one around until it sheds the skin and they have a nice snack. Ranchers could also raise Appletun and collect their shed skin as well.  The meat/protein part I’m still hung up on, so I guess Mudbray and Mudsdale are the only once who don’t escape alive lol.  Still an interesting theory though.
Let’s be real if animals could talk irl, even just saying their names and show expressions most people would be vegetarians..
Miltank doesn't have evolution so its the most effective like you said he isn't gonna be battling them so they would be best at level one
"it's almost like they [the anime creators] think through the logistics of this world" 😂 Tell that to AceTrainerLiam
Don't forget the fish Matpat! In terms of seafood, Magikarp is a clear cut choice for everyone. Being one of the most prominent [and largest in numbered] fish in the Pokemon world, the only reason you would want to fish up a Magikarp other than Gyarados raising is to eat it! Why do you think there are so many fishermen in every region? In terms of size its got a mass of 10 kg on average, double the yield of most regular fish, plus it doesn't have to be raised since it can be cooked fresh out of the water.   In the anime, Ash and Team Rocket even suggest cooking a Magikarp James got as a scam to survive.
Time to eat some nurse joy ;)
Not to be Pedantic but 7:37 isn't a Garchomp.
7:34 when he says garchomp it shows a gabite lmao
Eats mewtwo Everyone in Pokemon YoU JuSt AtE ThE StRoNgEst PoKeMoN
Garchomp
You showed gabite when you said garchomp
Wait thats gabite
This was cool
Considering tomatoes exist in the anime, I'm pretty sure the vegetarians are fine.
Gonna eat them all!
Fish. The Pokémon world is mostly based on Asian countries. Most of the nations are just large islands.  Goes great with brock’s rice 🍙 err I mean donuts 🍩
Maybe not a rat like pikachu
Praise God
When showing the steps to hatch garchomp, you put a picture of gabite(the evolution below it) but good try buddy!
7:33 that’s gabite
Im gonna keep asking again and again until you to make a theory on the number of calories consumed by mankind, eating disorders, homeless, and even cavemen included(if possible)
What about seafood? You don't even have to raise them for seafood. Just go out there on a body of water, toss a Magnemite to zap them fishies, ???, profit.
I want to consume rotom
Kid Danger: *wearing his moto pup outfit and raises a eyebrow* WHY WOULD YOU EAT POKÉMON?! I I mean, Jesus Tapping dancing Christmas Christ! Where on this green earth did you come up with this?! Jesus Christ! Eating Pokémon is just wrong!
But Mudsdale and Mudbray are ground Pokémon... So, i'm eating earth and mud more than meat 😂
what 🤠
What do the dates on chip bags mean? Doesn’t seem to be expiration date since most people way chips way past that. How long does it take for a bag of chips to go bag if not sold from the store?
My pokemon farm is a Wii game
There was an episode that showed an island full of "Pudgy Pidgey", being 3x larger than your average Pidgey at a weight of 12 lbs, with the loss in their ability to fly due the lack of predators. If selective breeding & genetic modification was possible in pokemon, we'd exclusively raise the Pudgy Pidgey as a broiler chicken, having the same hatch rate as Hoothoot, with a medium slow growth rate with only a diet of grains & maybe a few Caterpie. Then there's the daunting thought of "Pudgy Pidgeotto", being a whopping 132.2-198.3 lbs, depending on a 2-3x growth rate, while your average Noctowl would only be 89.9 lbs, only having to maybe add Magikarp to the existing diet. In a way Kanto Fried Pidgey would exist.😆
I'm 3 minutes in, and I'm calling it now. Milktanks.
he said Garchomp and there was a picture of Gabite 💀
Im so lonely i duet with myself 😎
Is there even a place that sells owl mean?
Magikarp is now finally useful.
I'd eat Nurse joy.... If you know what I "mean"  Wink wink..
69th video nice
Bruhh vegans gonna be mad
Mentions Garchomp:  Shows Gabite
You Should WHAT?
I hope vegan teacher does not find this😭🖐
Ive been watching you for along time owo
BEST 👏  CAPTION 👏 EVER!!!!! 👏🤣♥️🇵🇭  For me, i'd eat Gardevoir  out 1st. 😉✨
I’m scared about matpat’s mental health
I just can't imagine mudbrey meat isn't poisonous. They have mud in their name and I can only imagine their meat has a earthy flavour for not great reasons
This seems to ignore the fact that we know Miltank is farmed for it's Milk. We see it in the games. If your criteria excludes something we know to be true, then that's a knock against the Criteria
I sure love eating a pokemon whos weight comes from the sheer amount of dirt, mud, clay and rock apart of its body.
This is the 69th episode of food theory nice
Matpat  ate a worm
I’m not gonna eat my vaporeon there’s something much better to use it for
I remember in pokemon sword and Shield when you get your first pokemon i see the family doing a barbeque and i don't think they have normal animal in pokemon world
Why'd did you call Spearow a "Pidgey Clone." It only has 2 evoloutions, is the same generation as Pidgey. : (
According to rule 34 you can in fact "eat" every pokemon.
OwO UwU OwO
Dude, now I carve some read meat from animals I haven't tasted
Let's just hope that the vegan teacher doesn't lecture this video...
uhhhhh MatPat, That is not Garchomp at 7:35, that's Gabite
Fresh meat >:)
You sould have made this with just regional dex, not every pokemon exist in every region
What about fish??
say what now?
I literally just watched a Pokémon movie yesterday
If nurse joy is a pokemon, does it mean we could eat her too...? 😳
Hoothoot is a lot chunkier than I realized
scrambled exeggcute 😋
Kanghaskan hatches with a baby though. It doesn’t need to level up to mature
ㅤ
But I don’t want to eat a torchic 😢
11:42 I’m not eating an owl😰
For vegetarians, eat berries.  Depending on the game, you can plant a single Oran berry in the ground and 24 hours later find a tree with 4 to 20 new berries ready to be harvested and replanted or eaten. Growth speed like that sounds pretty impressive, especially if your pokemon sla... I mean valuable workforce of pokemon friends can assist in the planting, watering, and harvesting process. A vegetarian trainer doesn't have to eat their pokemon, they just have a team of pokemon workers tending their berry farm.
Matpat Plants *are* LINING THINGS, sooo maybe every food is JUST killing... VEAGAN TEACHER EXPLAIN!!! WE GROW TRESS IN GARDEN WHY SOME ARE EATEN AND DESTROYED FOR WOOD EH?
For those curious, whalord is the floating pokemon, filled with gas like a large balloon and floating at the water's surface incapable of diving. It's a silly pokemon, just a giant balloon, and is thus very light.
That's just a theory a Food Theory thanks for watching!!!!
So... Poultry is still unknown because Hoothoot is an owl. Owls are birds of prey and those supposedly taste really bad (according to Google). Being birds who hunt, I can also suppose their meat is very hard and would feel like trying to eat a shoe. Not recommended. I vote Doduo. Probably hard meat if you let them run free but easy to raise and big.
Don't forget gen 1 through gen 4 were set in Japan, and the Japanese diet would be a very large factor in those, explaining why so many water types were present.
Yep he finally lost it
Why is this not in game theory
THAT'S NOT GARCHOMP THAT'S GABITE
7:38 that is Gabite not Garchomp :/
I would just eat that one made out of like cream
Why do you need to level up your Pokémon after it hatches if you want to eat them?
Time to eat Garbodor
As well thought out as this theory is, I feel as though it isn’t without flaw! Mudbray (as far as we’re currently aware) is only native to 2 regions, being Alola and Galar. It’s highly unlikely that they’d be used as the most common livestock when it’d have to be imported from less than 25% of the Pokémon world’s regions. If I had to venture a guess, I’d say that Magikarp would be the most common meat source. Despite the effort it takes to raise them to maturity, they’re known to be found in  every single region of the globe! They also reproduce like wildfire! They’re by far the most abundant Pokémon within their world! Not only that, but due to it being a fish, it’d take very little prep-time on behalf of anyone cooking it! You could dress it up fancy on a bed of rice, or fry it up as fish sticks! Farming them would be very inexpensive in terms of owning land. Plus, they’ve been known to live in both salt water AND fresh water. So weather you’re sea faring or land locked, you can cast your net and find yourself a feast! It’s so common that to this day, it is the only Pokémon that you can just buy outright from some random dude! (Outside Mt.Moon for the same price as a Potion and a Poké Ball!) Not to mention, it was even stated in the anime that it makes for a delicious meal! Need I say more?
What about rare candy
Never thought Food Theory can get so barbaric
So if you hatch a miltank in the games, you would have a lv 1 or a lv 5 miltank depending on what games you play. Matpat views Levels AS age (which is fair since evolutions Are tied to Levels, and for some Pokemon like ralts its just like them growing up) but you can then submit the very same lv1/5 miltank to the daycare and have it give Birth to another egg. Wouldnt that mean that most Pokemon Are mature from Birth?   Also while mudsdale is Heavy, its not that big for its size. This means that its weight very likely comes from how dense its muscles are, which in turn means that its meat could be inedible for humans unless its treated ahead of time
I'd totally run a dairy farm with skidoos and miltanks. Skidoos give more and Miltank milk is high end premium milk.
Ironically, the Medium Fast group actually levels slower than the Medium Slow group at low levels. Medium Slow pokemon take about half the experience to get to level 10, and about 2/3 the experience to get to level 20, compared to Medium Fast pokemon. It isn't until the 60's that Medium Fast becomes faster, and while the theory wasn't too specific as to a target level for optimal food consumption, I question the logistics of raising livestock until they are strong enough to basically defeat everyone in the region, then hauling them off to the slaughterhouse.
Ok this theory is good, BUT bones are not accounted in here, IDK but I think the larger/heavier the pokemon is the bigger it's bones are going to get.. Not sure tho, just another theory I guess...
14:40 .....   😏  Lol jk, I'm not gonna go there.
Waiter! I would like to order a role of Magikarpe sushi with a Shuckle shake and a piece of Appleton pie for desert!
i always wanted to know where ash got his meat from
What’s for dessert?
You made my cry thanks
So matpat should I use vaporeon as a fleshlight
You missed you chance to make this another 3 way episode on all the channels
Me with pku: haha thats really funny. Protein... Who is she😂
0:49 when you have no friends
So some people would be scared of magicarf like ,e
12:49 the reason that Mudsdale  and Mudbray are so heavy is because all the dried mud caked on the pokemon. And, dried mud is really heavy.
So you saying to eat my gardevoir?
amplin could just get out of its apple since its not there skin.
Concerning Miltank and the Skiddo dairy contest, MatPat clearly overlooked that Miltank learns Milk Drink at level 11 while Skiddo has to wait until level 50, being much less efficient.  Of course, as egg moves can be passed down from both parents knowing the same level up move, two Skiddo that know Milk Drink can make babies that know Milk Drink right out of the egg, though the same could be said about male Skiddo and Miltank breeding.    The bigger issue is that he's clearly overlooking that more than half of Mudbray's weight comes from a coating of mud, not the meat inside the body.
Your mouth still you ate a post Kimon you ate your Pokémon I cannot believe you ate my my favorite being in the universe of game a Pokémon
Just so you know, Pokemon Ranch did exist. I had it on my wii (yes, it was that long ago). It was great. Your friend gave you a Pokémon every day and you could just collect them. 10/10.
11:20 MatPat starting his own Poké-Rap😂
a 46 lbs bird lol.
And this is why you should make your Pokemon fu- I mean breed
Applin is actually the worm and not the apple
Really thanks for mat making these entertaining videos for us :3
Forgot to mention thank you for ruining my childhood, he was a way to happy of an idiot
ummm ill pass
I do really want to know how to make a Pokémon salad
pidgey for sure, they are sooo common
Mat...  11:11  It's Murkrow...  Not Mukrow...   Murkrow is a play on words for the definition of "Murder" not only being a lethal crime but also a gathering of crows...  You're welcome.
You can always count on mat to make disturbing thumbnails
Majority of your diet actually consists of corn. Roughly 75 percent of the products you buy at the store have some form of corn in them. The obvious ones such as corn syrup, corn starch, and more. Any Frito brand chips you buy are literally just corn too, while that should be obvious I thought I should cover my bases. Corn is put into more products than you think because of how many uses it can have. Not only does it have so many uses, but it's so commonly used because it's cost effective to grow and you get more profit from it. One main attraction towards it is that it's a cheap, filling food to eat.
can’t they use stones to evolve pokémon
Thanks now all I can think about is eating Nurse Joy
7:34 I am gonna be that person, that ain't a Garchomp, that a Gabite 12:48 Mega Metagross is not a legendary
👌🏼
Magikarp would be gross. Miltank would be awesome, and farfetched is a duck, so delicious.
now i wonder does  lunala taste like farfetch'd?
I dunno, sometimes the official size and weight are absolutely ridiculous and don't make *any* sense, so I take them with a HUGE grain of salt. I mean, look at Outside Xtra's latst Show of the Weekend XD
That ain’t a garchomp bro
8:17 veal is a good option too
As someone who knows nothing about pokemon I agree, and I feel enlightened
IF you can catch a hoot hoot... they're famous for confusing hunters.
#9 on trending, nice!   Which fish pokemon would be the best to eat? Magikarp seems like the obvious answer but is it?
6:35 do you have dirty mind or not this is the test
You should also see what Pokemon would be the best sea creature option and I'd love to hear the best plant Pokemon! They could be included for what the live stalk you raise as well. More please!
I hate this channel
is this game theory film theory or food theory
We need the Pokemon version of Stardew Valley
wtf is THIS!!!
7:35 that's gabite not garchomp
7:34 that's a gabite...
In my fantasy world-built country, where there is literally no pasture land, the primary sources of protein are fish, chickens, goats, and insects. The other staple foods are rice and leafy greens, which can be grown aquaponically alongside raising the fish, as well as the abundant native fruits.  Edit: the reason why aquaponic farming is actually viable for this society is mainly due to its cultural history of what I’m tentatively calling inverse-colonization. Imagine that instead of European colonists coming and concurring a native population with advanced tech and spreading devastating diseases, the “Europeans” were instead refugees and the native people actually had good enough medicinal practices to not get wiped out by pathogens. Very different sociocultural interaction.
HOOTHOOT looks like turkey led with eyes!
Nurse Joys are friends,not food
Why is Mudbray so heavy, though? It's a Ground-type pokemon, so it is entirely likely that it incorporates rock and literal mud into its physiology. That means that large portions of it may not be edible at all, and the muscles required to move all that weight around might be too tough to eat as well.
I used to do it all the time people used to call me weird all the time i thought i was the only one thanks for clearing that up for alot of people now would you happen to want to go to diner and eat some pokemon my favorite type is pikachu
In x & y I believe, you could go to restaurants and order food. In that they specifically reference what pokemon you are eating.
Id eat nurse joy 😉
Where is the video of the woman cooking bulbasaur
The Gameboy opening warmed my 14 year old heart.
I think magikarp would be a good choice for fish and chips
"Eating Nurse Joy."  "This better not awaken anything in me."
I have one word for you; Vore
Does this mean we can eat nurse Joy?
7:36 thats a gabite :c
The vegan teacher  is going to make a video about matpat
hi owo
You can either eat nurse joy or eat out nurse joy. Choose wisely.
Most Pokedex entries say how Pokemon as food is usually a delicacy or some kind of dropping and since it's cannon that real animals exist in the Pokemon world I wouldn't be surprised if they ate normal chickens and cows since they won't put up as much of a fight as a magic fire kicking chicken
rip intros
Hold up, if theres no pigs or cows then, what do they eat?
mat "we could just end up eating nurse joy" Confused voreaphiles "were we not supposed to?"
Fun fact: mimiku shiny is a spirit from a dead mimiku
Not so fun fact: beef is insanely inefficient in terms of land and water usage, and it emits a ridiculous amount of methane. Eat mo' chicken and less beef, for the planet.
Puts a whole new meaning to “gotta catch ‘em all”😭
6:35 😳
4:06 Me: Potatoes.
In the Pokémon world we don't see toilets so the Pokémon world is full of poop
Owls taste not good. Not personal experience but a simple google search so I’ll stick will eating togepi
It kinda makes senses
“...and Garchomp” *shows a gabite*
When will you play deltarune chapter 2?
yum
You didnt factor in taste though... owl meat doesn’t sound that appetizing and even moreso mudbray would probably taste like mud...
7:38 thats a gabite not a garchomp…
Shoulda had a Bug Protein category
oh man, the Gameboy color opening! nostalgia man...
just eat the eggs boom
The Safari Zone is a direct parallel to conservations that allow hunting
WHY DID YOU PUT GABITE WHEN YOU SAID GARCHOMP THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS AND ARE COLLABING WITH YOURSELF
I don't think you thought this trough matt, mudbray eats mud. And while on the flip side, it would be dirt cheap to feed. (get it ?)  on the other side, I'm pretty sure it would also taste like mud. Your assumption that it will contain proteins at all is kinda bold. As much as you'd probably discard graveler because he's a literal rock, i would discard mudbray as a literal pile of dirt.
69th video
6:48 Can't forget the Mewtwo meatballs to go with your Squirtle spaghetti
Do you plan on making a theory on the new remake coming out or on legends arceus?
That was a good intro...
i'm still confused on how pokemon haven't rebelled against humans yet
I just realised, non of the pokemons are mammals since they come from eggs
The video where he says that Pokemon trainers earn almost nothing: Oh I don't think so
Me, a vegetarian, watching this: InTeReStInG!
There's one catch to that poultry answer, though: Owls are carnivorous, feeding on small mammals.  That not only makes them more expensive to raise but also more difficult to eat.  When measuring caloric efficiency for carnivores, you have to factor in the caloric efficiency of their prey, too.  Furthermore, carnivore meat isn't as easy to digest as herbivore meat.
fire your editor 7:38 that a Gabite not Garchop
You know this was always something I assumed they did but never wanted an answer to
If the growth time for the pokemon is based on level, then I wonder how much information would change if we used rare candies
This on the first night in over a year that I ate lobster; and over a pound of it in a stew
just wanna mention.. that wasnt Garchomp beside Tyranitar.... that was Gabite. JUST saying
Pokémon supposedly are people and can become people so you are endorsing cannibalism
Well, I do want to "Eat" my Gardevoirs ;).  Edit: Fish would be a good source too.
That's why I am a vegetarian, I dont wanna eat a random cute animals which calll out their name thousand's of times.
While mudbray and mudsdale are heavy, taking into consideration they are ground type, probably means there is a large amount of earth and dirt included in said weight. They probably also taste like dirt, so most likely not very appealing.
Praise God
*proceeds to break jaw attempting to eat grilled Onyx before watching the full video*
MatPat: I finally found that Pokémon are edible. Everyone: Wow, that's great! Meanwhile, BDG: ...If you'll excuse me, I'm going to throw myself into the ocean now.
Oe
Um Mrs Joy isn’t a Pokémon she is person
*yum*
This is the 69th food theory video and thats all I have to say
THE START UP ANIMATION IS THE SAME FROM GAMEBOY ADVANCED T-T
does nurse may eat Pokemon to then😱
You didn't take taste and texture into account, the donkey ones are gonna be hella tough to chew bc of all the muscle. @MATPAT
2:40 (lives in south) those numbers are insultingly low
But, Hoothoot might be a carnivour as owls are. How are you going to feed it?
I'm pretty brock.wants to eat nurse joy...
You guys should do blue moon ice cream 😩 there is no clear recipe and no one know what’s makes it taste the way it does!
With about all the vegans that are vegan because they hate plaints?
you forgot to mention with the hatching, are you going to invest in the time for a pokemon for flame body? that will half the time/ step count for an egg to hatch
TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY !!!!!✨
mat you made me watch this eight before an exam
i think this was one of my nightmares 6:35
"Dragonite, Tyraintiar and Garchop" *posts a Gabite
7:36 that’s a Gabite not a garchomp, also it’s weird that the gabite is shown in its art form while the other two use their sprites
I feel like the Pokemon that get eaten (mostly),  dont go into a pokeball at all. Just breed up to be eaten
Fried torchic with franks red hot sauce sounds like it would be…… fire.
👁️👄👁️
Mat moo moo milk is warm no cold
At 9:12 that Milltank is getting some head 😂😂
i had this video at 1.5x speed and didnt notice for half the video because he always talks fast lol
While I like most choices. I dislike the mudbray and mudsdale for red meat considering most of thier weight is coming from the thick mud that has hardened around thier legs. The mud is so thick and heavy that it can dig into asphalt. In the manga it was seen sending a bolder flying and causing a tidal wave. So how much could you really eat after you stripped it of its heavy mud.
upset there wasnt a film theory bout the shows/movies
7:37 matpat realize that not garchomp that gabite
Another Crossover Theory idea that I hope makes the cut: theatre owners consider a movie a success if they can sell a lot of popcorn with it.  Is there any correlation between how many tickets a movie sells and how much the concession makes?  Maybe MatPat could do a Food Theory crossover episode and compare different snacks with different movies (Marvel movie with popcorn, Rom-Coms with Raisinettes, etc.).
Making them fight to death as slaves = OK. Eating their flesh, milk and eggs = ...gross
I mean kids are allowed to come in to a Pokemon center and change their Pokemon from matter to energy and back for free, so as far as im concerned, most people get the majority of their food from computer generated 3d-printed staple foods like star trek replicators.  Granted it's relatively new technology (probably at least as new as porygon) and not all families have access to it. Plus "natural" foods are still eaten of course.
I think cradily tentecle sushi would be delicious
Did anyone else notice that Mat said Garchomp, but a Gabite photo was shown?
Miltank wantonly spraying milk from its udders is one of the most unsettling things I've seen today, thank you
7:33 that is a gabite!!!
mmm now i want some pokemon c:
uuuuuuhhhhh I mean, yeah?
So we should eat Nurse Joy?
That wasn't a garchomp. You pulled a pokemon rap and used the image of its pre evolution Gabite instead
You needed to include Seafood for the seafaring folks that hardly see land.
The second he brought up growth rate I instantly remembered that Insect type pokemon are the fastest to evolve.  You've also got to take into account pre-slaughter resources that you can get from them, and the rate that you get it from them throughout periods of its life, and changes in growth-rate throughout a creatures life instead of just waiting until something's fully grown to determine optimal slaughter times. You still slaughter dairy cows after all.
Plot twist:  Meat is pretty much never cost effective, the government simply constantly floods money into it.
6:37 😳
12:13 So I saw the image that MattPatt made that was the reverse of the guy and...I love it, it's so cursed and yet quite a laugh when I paused on it.
Would channel's egg be the egg replacement?
Abundance of water
Holup
I hope he does a theroy on the of yu-gi-oh
imagine if there was a cook, eat or even feed option when you click on a pokemon. hmmm Charizard is low on health. let's feed him Pikachu.
Your "game" theory channel should really be named "pokemon theory" because I barely see anything else mentioned there other than mario games.
Wooloo Venison.
bruh moment
This video is good, but can we all agree that BDG did It better?
Says garchomp, shows gabite. Press X to doubt
I love how the Theorists post pokemon info heavily relying on the anime. And they haven't posted a pokemon thing on Film Theory this week.
7:30 that ain’t garchomp
“ In America where labor is expensive and land is cheap…”  Wait. What?
Tauros steak, for one.
He forgot to factor in that the animals or pokemon in this case should be easy to capture and stay in captivity by early humans.  Any animal in some capacity is dangerous to farm with in real life, since pokemon have magical abilities we have to choose those pokemon that do not pose too much of a danger when getting slaughter. And Its also better to have the pokemon that low to medium intelligence than a high intelligence creature. Well we cant let them escape can we. So hoothoot will be out of the question, as not only the pokemon is smart enough to figure how to escape, it also can fly which can help during an escape, also this is reason why we dont eat much flying birds. They will just fly away.
NO PORK it's not Halal
I think ya might want to have considered the typing of all of these Pokémon. For example, how much of Mudbray and Mudsdale are mud/ground and how much of them is meat?
@07:40 that is a Gabite, good sir. Not a Garchomp.
Is appelin in the fruit category or meat category ?
There are also none pokemon animals in the setting too we just don't see them in the games or shows for the same reason we don't see so much of the rest ofbthe setting.
*slowly sips koolaid* huh, so... would eating nurse joy be considered cannibalism or just another creature.....?
So... In conclusion, Pokemon is not a kid friendly show and my childhood has been ruined.
i like how the video has nothing to do with the title. the question answered in this video was "what is the most common thing people in the pokemon universe eat that is a pokemon" btw
Thanks matpat now you made me depressed
In Mongolia we raise our live stock in the wild and give them food in the winter in return for their milk and meat unlike most other countries where they are raised in captivity and almost never see their own children grow up in Mongolia they raise their child and when they get old we eat them
I would eat nurse joy
No just no
Man, I could really go for some Slurpuff sufflé just about now
I need to know how does olive garden’s stay in business with the free breadsticks and such when people Only buy a water and that’s it
Brian David Gilbert
I bet theres one kid that catches a butter free *or any other bug type* and just eating it...
I trying to picture someone trying to eat an onix
I think I saw somewhere the feebas tastes good
The funny thing is in the alola region you can see kiawe's farm and it shows mudbray and miltank on there so that shows that they see those are some of the most efficient things from milk and meat because they don't have Skidoo on the alola region
*shows gabite when he says garchomp* i but someone got fired for that blunder
Not to be sus or anything but id eat a nurse Joy
Hey yall whos in for some fried torchic?
For me, I went vegetarian only because my body was having digestive issues. I did something drastic in hopes the issue would be resolved. It worked for me! So to answer ur last bit, no, I would still eat a plant pokemon if they don't have muscle tissue like other Pokemon.  😂
Yep that is true people eat pokemon course I saw A SLOWPOKE TAIL AND IT IS COOKED professor your not eating my kraby are you WHAT and you cant eat magic karp its body is rock solid
He didn't talk about fish tho I'd like to know what a gyrados would taste like
There's a sinnoh myth about this which also handily explains why no weapons exist. A man made a sword and attacked and ate pokemon, but he couldn't find any after a while, and when he finally found one it spoke, and he came to the dreadful realization that all the pokemon he'd eaten were sentient. He cast off his sword and swore never to eat a pokemon again, in exchange for pokemon returning to the region and not abandoning humanity. They did, but he never saw one again. He lived out the rest of his days in exile.  Think about the sentience of the being before you eat it. Potatoes exist, yes? if you eat the skins too, potatoes will provide all the nutrients a human needs. There ya go.
BDG’s gonna be fucking mad
You can eat the apple outside of an applin because the applin is the worm inside
I'm deeply concerned for matpats fbi....
Do a part 2 where you do fish and plant type pokemon.  I'm a vegetarian for dietary reasons so I don't especially consider it counter productive ... plus I'd just be interested in seeing the results.  As for fish ... well reasons with lots of water (like ruby/saphire) might actually have a better meat industry from fish than anything else.  Some reasons IRL do rely on seafood more than any other so it's a legitimate thing to take into account.
No we don’t eat Pokémon 😠😠😠
That thumbnail is so cursed post that in a subreddit
Of course they eat pokemon
"Not feeling guilty"             -matpat
how do you cook a fire pokemon? cause like if fire doesn't burn them then how do you cook it? or is it already cooked?
Wow, can't pause the video... YouTube Android update is terrible
This is Food Theory, Film Theory, AND Game Theory. THIS IS THE BEST COLLAB EVERR
So I should eat Nurse Joy? I was going to do that anyway.                     If you know what I mean. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
UhhHHHhhhH
Don't let vegan teacher see this
Wait... So if Nurse Joy is a Pokémon and they are delicious, then her husband is a very lucky guy.. 😏
Actually the appletun one wouldn't work since Appletun is a worm in the apple not the apple.
Supagreatman approves
Saw this and remembered the Pokémon Journeys ep in which a Blaziken refused to eat a sorta cake that had a Torchic face stamped onto it. T^T
I think there's another factor being overlooked here.  The diet of the potentially farmed animal and how efficient /that/ is.  An animal that eats hay and/or grass, like a cow, is easier to supply than an animal that itself primarily eats meat.  The Pokedex entries on Hoothoot doesn't discuss diet, but Noctowl is frequently referred to as a nighttime predator.  It's possible that the pokemon's diet changes during evolution; a lot of pokemon change a lot; but if the Hoothoot largely eats meat like regular owls, it'd be expensive to raise them because of diminishing returns.
Film Theory idea:  Newest pokemon movie, how did Koko manage to use an actual move that a Zarude only knew how to use?
Why just why
You know what, I'm using the Nexus
7:34 That is a Gabite -_-
Hey matpat you should make a video about taco bells crispy  chicken sandwich taco
The Dream I've Been Waiting For, A Pokémashup!
A more interesting case would be PMD. In that world there are no humans, and instead the Pokémon themselves act more like humans. Meaning basically every sentient being is seen as a person. Meat is never really addressed directly, but it's absence with the amount of other foods shown imply that vegan is the only socially acceptable option as eating meat would be essentially like cannibalism
Could I get a pokemon cookbook please
Brian David Gilbert did this better  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqzghgtJ1Is&ab_channel=Polygon
Matpat: Garchomp *shows picture of Gabite*
How come there are no  wheat or potato pokemon!?
It's call rune factory
I’d love to see a theory on the ranching of fish pokémon! Surely Magikarp isn’t the answer
What 'bout fishing?
Why nurse joy is a pokemon  Why you should eat you're pokemon           Should we eat nurse joy?
Best analysis I have seen of this topic.
Classic mat pat running childhoods
The Vegan Teacher be screaming by now
Ok now do it by region.
Wait if pokemon Are human that means every citizen Are Cannibals
Dang I’m the only giratena in the anime welp
Pokémon in China be like
is nobody gonna mention that he showed gabite when he said garchomp
i'm just gonna assume meltan is in the inedible category, along with most steel types and all poison types.
Hopefully the vegan teacher doesn’t see this
You should do a dietary plan for each region from rich to poor
Animals are just inefficient middle men for calories. If everyone ate plant based the world would be night and day different. Arnold Schwarzenegger is plant based btw...
7:43 says garchramp but that’s not knows on the screen that’s it’s pre evolved form lmao
I've actually been wondering this since like, forever!
Are Pokemon that are made of plants vegan
Thanks to you I now know which pokemon I want to eat. I will have a Nurse Joy please.
Yes because they're animals duh
Notification Squad!!!  :D
Imagine if theres a vegan that hates pokemon. **Visible confusion**
Does this mean we can eat nurse joy!!!?? I 🤔🤔🤔
WHAT ABOUT FISSSSSSSHHHHHH
Thanks for the video!
very foodful
I feel like you're missing an important element in all this...  How edible is the pokemon  Think about it for a second. Hoothoot may be the "ideal" from the standpoint of stats, however look at the pokedex entries where people/cultures view it as divine and use them as clocks. I'm not sure those cultures are going to be frying up hoothoot "wings" on game night. It also can learn a lot of psychic moves so even though it isn't a psychic type, I'd say there is something there with latent psychic abilities or similar so would it even allow itself to be eaten?  Mudbray/Dale are both ground type pokemon. Do they even have red meat? They eat dirt (again pokedex) and make their own mud which (inferring a couple entries together) hardens harder than stone around their legs. So even if they have red meat how much of that weight is meat vs this mud stone?
THATS A GABITE! 7:37
I really want pasta salad…
Pokemon is a fitting topic for three channels now, and if my guess on it is right, all four channels
As much information you did of what pokemon are the most edible..... There has only been 8 small areas of the world that we know of (in our world). The Pokemon-type Earth is completely covered in Pokemon, a very large chunk of which, we don't know. There can very well be over thousands of species of Pokemon, and we eat the 'stupid' ones. Those of which are not only efficient, but those who are incapable of rising up and fighting against the humans. Thus, I raise you one question MatPat, would the 'Friendship' of the Pokemon make it taste better, or worse?
Would people in the Pokémon world feel bad about eating Mudbray? Because i know for a fact that many people don’t want to eat horses.
Other people: care if Pokémon can be eaten Me: starts to think about adultery because I just remember a TF2 about having adultery act with Pokémon
11:04 "pie-dove"
I fed my slowpoke some slowpoke tails…
3:30 this is deeply offending to us taurus here     I’m just kidding can I have a bite?
I want a followup of diet based on region. That's gonna be a rabbit/Lopunny hole.
ayo wth???? that's kinda sus bro
applin is the worm not the apple
Majacarp you can't eat it's made out of metal
Is Magikarp the main fish substitute then? Is it efficient?
I would totally eat Nurse Joy 🤤
pika says: ara ara
Aight lets eat nurse joy
"let's eat some mudsdale... It tastes like dirt"
What if Pokémon are actually kidnapped people
Time to eat mumei
cool now I'm gonna eat them
Wishiwashi since it’s just a normal kinda small fish
They put the wrong picture for garchomp when talking about the steps for their eggs
my god he gone too deep
7:34 and garchomp true Pokemon fans know that is gabite
Make a theory of ranch pizza
Can you make a toy theory (something like why are barbies are so "happy")
Mudbray probably tastes like dirt. I'm pretty sure it weighs so much because its body consists of literal clay and rock
I bet Brock would like to eat Nurse Joy.
I'm pretty sure the only reason Mudsdale is not eatean, or it less evolved Mudbray are only as heavy cause of their non-edible hooves. I vote for Tauros, I mean look at it!
How about the duduo?
speaking as someone who actually raises livestock: sheep are generally better for old cow pastures (depending on how wet the ground is) vs cattle. lamb and mutton are better conversion on a feed/head per acre to meat (and money) .
EAT EAT
I wonder, if Mudsdale is roughly 8 times heavier then Mudbray, is it more cost efficient to get meat from Mudbray or is it worth putting in the extra effort to evolve it first?
Pov you came from game theory
That Gameboy intro was a blast from my childhood
You shouldn't believe the Pokedex. It's written by children
"This Pokémon has a jaw that's as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda's flesh is surprisingly tasty, too."  - Barraskewda's Pokédex entry from Pokémon Sword
You should do it episode on how strong Ash he picked up so many heavy Pokémon
If Pokémon farmers battle and level their creatures, they could be the most intimidating Pokémon trainers
How many drugs did you take before making this video?
i got to catch em all ... in my belly
8:18, Actually caviar used to be a poor person's food way back when...
But!!! Do we eat owls in our world? I’ve never heard of it
Anybody else bothered by the "Pokemon fan" MatPat using a Gabite image for Garchomp and pronouncing Murkrow as Muk-row?
I would do the donkey/ horse one because I would first split the mudbray into two groups consisting of the "slaughters" and the "evolvers" and you can probably get the idea from the names but half would be evolved by hired help and the other would be turned into quick meat for quick sells. is this a good idea or no?
Applein actually aren’t the apples
Says civilian, has nurse joy...
6:38 wtf mat
7:34 "rare pokemon like dragonite, tyranitar, and garchomo..." *puts picture of gabite and not garchomp*
Clearly we're forgetting the obvious choice...  TOGEPI! You can fry ‘em up, boil ‘em, make a nice soufflé, crack ‘em over rice, heck you can even slurp ‘em down raw! And that’s not even counting the way you can use them in baking cakes…
Had to squint for a second reading that title
I feel like Mudsdale and Mudbray would be bad options for meat sources. Unless they’re absolutely gigantic, their weight might be due to muscle density, so it’s bound to be tough af.
There may a slight problem with your Mudbray conclusion, I fairly certain a sizable protion of its weight comes from the dirt that matts into it's fur and clumps around it's hooves
Matpat: "Dragonite, Tyranitar, and GARCHOMP" Me, a Super Nerd: "don't do it, don't be THAT guy" My brain: "uM, aCtUaLlY-"
I mean, what other meats are you supposed to eat in the Pokémon world?
I have another Pokemon theory which is whats exactly does rare candies contain that makes it like it is
"Like Dragonite, Tyranitar and Garchomp" Shows Dragonite, Tyranitar and Gabite
someone in the Pokémon universe would probably hunt legendary Pokémon for food
FYI normal animals exist in Pokémon, e.g. Ash dresses as a Cow and Riachu can knock out an Indian elephant
Still won't eat my squirtle
Any Pokémon can be eaten if you are brave enough
what       wtf
You imply "pokemon don't evolve in the wild" as if you can't literally find wild evolved forms of pokemon you've already found in every pokemon game to exist
Darn, high amounts of coincidentally destroyed dreams again
uh oh, the vegan teacher is gonna fail you
I'm not surprise if the next theory will be impregnating pokemon.
a pokemon farmer who focuses on wool production as their main income source may actually benefit from evolving their wooloos into dubwools for higher wool yields from each individual animal. I think evolution may not make sense for all types of pokemon farmers but it's definitely a variable to consider, more so for not food product focused farmers but still. . as for pokemon farmers who do work with food, i think grass type pokemon should be classified as a crop instead of livestock since grass types tend to just be sentient plants more often then not. like oddish is basically just a blue radish with feet and a face. 100% a crop and not a livestock in my opinion. and crops are dealt with differently from livestock because the yields are different.
chair simulator
Should???
“Pokeh-mon” really mat pat
Only problem is all of your farm animals have super powers good luck slaughtering them without heavy resistance.
Great video, but consider that it would be pretty dangerous to farm a psychic bird with an above-average intelligence. As for Mudsdale, if I remember correctly, it's only that heavy because it's feet are pretty much rocks.
hhuUuumm
probably gotta account for regional climate, local grazing etc when considering farming options too. for instance in ancient indonesia, pigs and chickens were common protein because you can put them on boats and carry them around and they could survive in places with poor local grazing. with pokemon then, local climate, local culture, and possibly elemental stuff might factor in, and possibly raising and evolving dairy and egg-layers for better milk and egg production. so the question is what are Mudbray's grazing requirements?
AHHH!! I WILL DIE?!!! STOP MAKE IT FOOD?!!!!!
When Matt started talking about Bird he sounded like the Pokémon/Digimon intro guy that says all the Pokémon/Digimon.
Applin’s are the insides of the apple, the apple is a completely different object, therefore your intro is wrong-
As an equestrian there’s no way I’d eat a Mudbray lol. I’ll stick to Hoothoot and Skiddo
The problem with this video, is that (for Mudbray at least) you don't take into account the in-universe reasons WHY certain things are so heavy or light. You're spot on with most of your analysis of the pokemon, until you get to Mudsdale, who's over a tonne specifically because they're made mostly of dirt and rock. Nobody's going to be eating Mudsdale because a majority of their weight is inorganic not-meat
i go to a buffet every other weekend chinese to be specific and i def eat a pound of crustation OR MORE a year lol
where does the material from gigantimax pokemon come from? could you chop down G-max Snorlax's tree for infinite wood or meat?
Make a video about the Rick and morty season finale please
Really interesting mat. Nothing about fish 🐠?
I could never eat my Pokemon!
This better be a pokemon week
Sorry if I'm wrong, but can't chansey lay eggs every day, so wouldn't eggs from chansey be the best meat source
I think gairy is cheating because ash has a total of about 62 Pokémon of the newest series adventures but gairy manages to catch 200 in one series and also his Pokémon are somehow bigger than ashes despite not having time to catch them not to mention he’d have to be going at about the same pase of ash so that he can keep ahead. How is he cheating? Well it just so happens that gairy is the grandson of profesor oak who has access to hundreads of Pokémon not to mention if gairy really did catch 200 he would have at least 49 doubles and that’s if he court mew and mewtwo also he’d need to make time to train unless he started off with a nearly evolved version of squirtel witch could be the case or profesor oak could have been catching the Pokémon for him while he trained and went on his journey.
isnt mudbray just a horse made of mud
"Hoot hoot is the best bird pokemon to eat in a diet"  Torchic with it's evolution line: *"Are we a joke to u?"*
a third category should have been considered. commonality/reproductive rate. How easy would it be to find in the first place.
Food Theory: Is the Crispy Chicken Taco Sandwich a Sandwich, or a Taco?
If I have a plant like Pokémon diet am I a vegan or not?
7:34 “Dragonite,Tyranitar and Garchomp”  Me:No,the screen shows Dragonite,tyranitar and Gabite
I think this video made me a vegan
Ah yes pokemons are now frickable and eatable
My only real gripe with Mudbray and Mudsdale as pokemon to use as farm animals is that they're ground types, meaning that there is a possibility that their interal organs could be hardened by the soil, and on bulbepedia the entry fir Mudsdale outright says it has mud on its mane and hooves, which would make it a bit more dense than if it was just straight fleshy/biological bits
You had me at "meat economy"
Fun video. Have some engagement.  Geography and culture, as in the real world, are primary features to consider in answering this question, so I believe the answer must vary from region to region. There are sure to be variations within regions as well (Greedent and Polywag, I'm looking at ye). Assuming North American suburban dining standards only answers which pokemon people would be eating in our particular late stage capitalist hellscape.
*Sneezes on my Magikarp*
mudbray and mudsdale are probably heavier then the would be because of the constant covering of mud and earth.
Pokemons are edible     Whats next is hotdogs made out of trash
I want to eat a ditto
OH NO! GARCHOMP DEVOLVED INTO GABITE!
There are normal animals in the Pokémon world to
https://youtu.be/2CEs-ze5puI Hol’ up
... Garchomp... You sure about that Mattpat? You sure that's a Garchomp?
Applin don't grow on trees.
I might be completely misremembering, but I believe I read somewhere that Mudbray/Mudsdale is only that heavy because it's covered in so much mud. As a Clydesdale, I'm sure it would naturally pack some weight, but I believe the mud accounts for a good portion of it
Time to eat Eevee in my Lets Go Eevee game...
Wait does that mean everyone is cannibals
You really think you can say Garchomp and put up a picture of Gabite (it’s pre evolution) and get away with it??
Has anyone seen BDG's pokemon edibility ranking?
One factor that goes overlooked here is the rate at which Pokemon lay eggs. You might get more meat per individual Pokemon faster on a HootHoot but if Pidgey lays eggs twice or 3 times as fast then the amount of meat per Pokemon matters less and could be outpaced fairly quickly. There's no real canon sources on the rate at which pokemon lay eggs but if it's analagous to real world animals, smaller prey animals will tend towards having more children, as to outpace the rate at which they're hunted by predators. Larger predators meanwhile have fewer, so there's not as much competition for food and water. Bug Pokemon, I think, are probably the best candidates in terms of efficiency, maybe grass, as they tend towards being smaller prey animals that depend on large colonies, while grass Pokemon have the advantage of being able to supplement large parts of their diets with photosynthesis while also potentially relying on large groups, making farming them much less costly in terms of feeding. Bug Pokemon in particular, if they ARE analagous to their real world counterparts, are also universally larger and more massive than the real thing, Caterpie and Weedle, for example, are about the size of a small dog, as are Paras and Parasect, though most of these are poisonous. Given the rate at which they multiply, the Nincada line seems like a good candidate for a staple food, the fact that when they evolve,  they produce an entire extra pokemon that could be used for meat (if Shedinja isn't just an empty shell in terms of meat), and that rare candies mean that evolution can be artificially accelerated. It would produce meat on an exponential growth curve. Though you can't ignore flavor as part of this discussion. If people don't like the taste of Nincada, Ninjask, or Shedinja meat, it won't be adopted as a staple food.  The best candidate, I think, would be the Combee line. Massive enough that a single one could produce a decent sized meal, reproduce in colonies, and likely taste like honeycomb given that they're both the bee AND the hive itself. Being shaped like honeycombs, they're also really efficient in terms of space, fitting together in the most efficient configuration possible so any farm specializing in Combees and Vespiqueens is going to be able to fit a LOT of them on a relatively small amount of land.
Actually, I've told this to my dear brother about many times. (Before this video existed) I saw in Pokémon (The lastest movie) there were no animals not even a single one! Just Pokémon.    But what are the citizens eating? Meat or Vegetables? Until i saw this video by dear Food Theory. I'm glad this video has been uploaded. To answer my question.
I think your completely overlooking taste and looking into efficiency too much, I personally wouldn't want to eat owls or donkeys, idk if pokemon people would like it either.
But I don't want to eat my vaporeon...
This should upgrade veganism 👀
Most of mudsdale’s weight comes from the hardened mud around it’s legs
People on their way to eat their gardenvoir: *insert lenny face here since I don’t know how to make one*
What a disturbing title lol
Applin is a worm that is inside an apple it’s not the apple itself
Hey Matt PatI have two questions that I hope you would do in the next video my first is how do Pokémon die my second is a do Pokémon eat Pokémon
Did he say “muck-crow”
why do I hear boss music...?
"Nurse joy is a pokemon" "Eat your pokemon"  What the?
Speaking of pokemon edibility and collabs, I would love to see a collab between BDG and MatPat.
The collaboration works thanks for the videos
69th video
I'd argue Mudsdale would be a poor choice versus Buffolant. Taste is an important factor, and while there's many animals that might be more efficient in the real world, if they taste bad, people won't eat them. Mudsdale is a pure ground type, meaning there would likely be a distinct taste of Earth within the meat.
I would say Snorlax would be easy too farm and they get quite a lot of meat... Trouble is the unknown time it take for them to mature and the taste.
Dittos could be anything so that's probably what they eat all the time.
You just know Mr Mime taste like chicken
matpat: shows garchomp me and pob alot of peoples: its a GABITE
I feel like torchic and combusken would be the poultry animals, plus the wings are already hot wings so you can’t beat that
the tumbnail ash eating pikachu ash will never eat pikachu
im sorry i wont eat the cute pokemon there too cute
7:34 that's a gabite
Matpat, dude, the problem with the theory is that even in real life we hardly ever use the most efficient animals to eat. Bugs are easily the easiest and most profitable, but we don't eat them, nor do we eat owls.   Also, I thought it was proven in cannon that humans were animals
I dont really think beef is an animal :)
Are you telling me to eat Nurse Joy ;)
MatPat - Says Garchomp, shows Gabite. XD
“… The donkey and horse meats…” Tina Belcher’s childhood is now officially ruined🤣
But MatPat!? You forget that if Hoothoot is based on a rl Owl then they are predators! And therefore probably unable to be raised on cheap, plant-based fodder.
Thanks for joining the alliance Mat Pat
3:14 "regular civilian." **shows Nurse Joy**
Eating Nurse Joy doesn't sound all that bad if you catch my drift
This is classic Mat Pat
When I saw this, my first thought was "Oh, God why?" Side note: the weight of the Pokemon are hilariously stupid. Wailord could literally float in air, it's so light
wh-
Hi lol
SHAME
Thats gabite not garchomp love you MatPat
Idk if plants could talk I could go vegetarian
YOU NEVER MAKE A THEORY ABOUT SQUID GAME WATCH IT AND MAKE A THEORY ABOUT IT ITS BEEN 4 DAYS
7:33 that's a picture of a gabite
ever realised how uncreative the scientists of pokemon are??   they literally name the pokemon after the noise they make! it's not like their names came from nowhere!  it's like naming a cow a moo or a fish a glub
I always wondered what wild Pokémon eat if they don’t eat berries. Huh
Nurse Joy Is the most unlikely
Metagross and Celesteela are not Legendaries, Matthew.
Next theory do pokemon eat each other
is this food theory or game theory?
Can you make a theory if we should eat kids
Fun fact, Wailord would float like a balloon according to the math
Mathew you can’t eat Pokémon you find on trees
I’d eat Ms. Joy 😉 lol
3:11 lol that's my computer background
*laughs in vegan*
The problem I have with this is that he didn’t consider the size aspect, sure mudsdale may weigh more but that only means denser meat, not more meat. Additionally what if mudsdale’s weight comes from its mane or bone? I don’t think anyone’s gonna eat those
3:05 I WANT TO EAT ARCEUS, GIVE ME THAT GOD STEAK
Hoot hoot looks like a chicken leg already.
Why the h
Okay, I actually want a Pokemon-branded Farm sim. Probably makes me the lowest common denominator, but I don't care. I just want it
I would totally eat Theory Os as part of a balanced breakfast/lunch/dinner/whenever.
Everybody Gangsta Til PETA Comments On This Vid.
lol i saw mr beast and markiplier
>Like Garchomp That's Gabite.
Matt I'm really worried... Are you ok?
7:38 uh that’s a Gabite!
Wait... Game theory said Nurse Joy was a Pokemon... I don't- I don't want to try canibalism
7:37 GABITE, NO GARCHOMP!!!!  Otherwise great vid
Welp, time to get the stick I use for my fire attacks and start using it to put some Hoothoot on my plate.  Perhaps even get some Vaporeon sushi if I'm lucky.
Yem
Farfetched was hunted to NEAR extinction.
#saveeevee
You do know that applin is the worm not the apple so you can eat the apple and if your eating the worm cook it first
Look up cutting open bulbasaur. You're welcome.
YOU HEARD THAT ODDISH
I find it funny that this video is in "Food" Theory
Most of plant base pokemon are poisonous for some reason
togepi    i would togepi it looks good smells good
You said Garchomp but you showed a picture of Gabite.
Thank you for uploading a video called “Nurse Joy is a POKÉMON!” Right after this
Probably a drop in the bucket, but I think Ditto would taste like Play-Doh.
SERIOUSLY!!! THAT’S GONE TOO FAR, MATPAT! YOU NEED TO SHUT THIS CHANNEL DOWN!!!
I think some Pokemon trainers are actually just Pokemon. Other characters age... But nurse joy and ash don't, for example.
Kinda wish y'all would contact and pokemon master like myself for pronunciation of pokemon and also how they look. You put Gabite while saying it's evolution Garchomp.
III HHHHAAAATTTTTEEEEE YYYYYOOOOOUUUUU!!!!!!!!!
You said garchomp not gabite
We do eat ostrich and emu.  It's just rare and expensive
It's interesting how less people seem to care about eating lamb vs eating veal. Of course, sheep meat is generally less popular than beef and lamb seems to be the only option there, but it's still weird to me that I haven't seen *anyone* emphasize the cruelty of slaughtering lambs the same way people talk about veal
Interesting that matpat doesn't really.talk about domesticatability. While all pokemon seem to be domesticated, it's far and away more efficient to raise animals for food when they 1) live in large groups (so you can raise many in the same area at the same time), and 2) are relatively docile and obedient towards humans. Especially with animals with crazy strength and powers, you don't want to try to farm a very stubborn and aggressive animal!
time to do some nurse joy massacre tiem
Garcomp? More like gabite
"The only things that outclass it in weight are legendaries"  *Shows picture of Celesteela and Metagross*
I like Pokemon
Why not fish and shellfish - is magikarp easiest to raise and farm but i think have too little edible meat, why not evolve tiny krabbys into kinglers immediatly for more meat? also, arent owl feathers most of the weight by percentage of most owls? will hoot hoot really provide the meat or are we trying to find the profitability of hot hoot down feather pillows/comforters? sorry ill shut up now
7:34 MataPat says, "Garchomp." Shows Gabite
Please sir. I'm as curious can be sir. Could you stop and chat with me for a minute? Could you teach me to be a smarter boy?  Hey, sir I have always loved my yum-yums. But I just know how to eat'em, so I ask you, sir: where does food come from?  Oh! You know it would mean the world to this young man if you could help him understand where all his favorite treats, the things he likes to eat, orginate from before he puts them in his tum-tum.  Well, golly lolly gumdrops.   Please sir, I dont wanna be a dum-dum. Im just hungry and I want some information. Mister, please, where does food come from?
I absolutely love these comparisons between the real world and the game world The analysis is amazing I find it all so fascinating
Hoothoot would probably not be the most efficient choice for poultry for one huge reason - the ecological pyramid. On the bottom are plants, which don’t require a lot of energy - just the sun; above them are herbivores, which require the energy of the sun which goes into the plants they eat; and above them are carnivores which require the sun going into the plants going into the herbivores going into them. This usually has economic implications, and why we don’t tend to eat a lot of carnivores. We don’t really eat a lot of carnivores because it takes a lot of energy to feed them - and while chickens are capable of eating meat (they’ll go after mice), their major diet is cheap grain. After all, ten pounds of grain is far cheaper than ten pounds of pinky mice. So, assuming Hoothoot are similar to real world owls in their diet and can only survive on meat, that means a vegetarian pidgey-clone, or one that can survive on mostly plants,  is going to produce more meat for your investment. So out of the three that were narrowed down, one Hoothoot cannot produce as much meat for the same cost of being raised on Ratatta as the horde of Spearow (assuming a diet similar to sparrows, which can live off seeds, grains, and our garbage - like pigs) you can raise on the huge amount of grain available for the same price as Ratatta meat. So unless the return on meat from a single Hoothoot is just that much more than all those Spearow put together for the same cost of raising, Spearow makes the most economic sense. Sorry, Matt!
This video is beyond reality
What’s the most common one it’s a pigeon or something probably that
*hugs my Eeveelutions for their dear lives*
Food theory video idea: what is the difference between cookie two step and cookies and cream ice cream? Cause the two ( one each) I had, looks and tastes the same , from blue bell p.s not sure if it was packed wrong or what
Hoothoot? Common Matpat. There's a reason all the animals we eat are herbivores.
Weight isn't  everything because pokemon can be made  of  other  stuff besides meat. If its made of stone or  iron/ has  a stone  or iron shell it  will be heavier without necessarily being better to eat
Bro plzzzzzzz do a film theory on Bojack horseman!
It would've been interesting to do a fish category as well, because I could see Poke farmers having fish runs.
This video just proves that MatPat doesn’t know the difference between Gabite and Garchomp.
Squid Game theory
That’s why it’s called Pokémon just like the food poke
Matpat: *Talks about garchomp* Editors: Yeah let's just put a gabite up there
This gives me My Pokemon Ranch vibes
Also, Mudbray and Mudsdale, uhhhh... well, the reason they're so heavy is because they're mineravores. They eat, EXCLUSIVELY, mud and dirt. And, I mean... I guess that's good for sodium content, but I'm not sure how tasty a meat would be if it were raised on mud and rocks.
dude they hatch a basically fuel size leveling is completely irrelevant  also miltank can make milk straight out of the egg, egg moves. it's like you forgot people breed thing to make more milk
Thank you Food Theory, now I can eat my Lopunny and Gardevoir every night.
When you eat your pokemon : They electrocute you,the explode in you,they flop inside of you
Don’t think that was garchomp mat
Cant wait for brok to find out he could EAT nurse joy
I need to rethink my life decisions. brb
7:32 totally Garchomp
How much of the weight of Mudbray is meat and how much is..mud?
As a vegan… oof
Applin is just a wyrm/worm that enters an apple, so applin don't grow on trees, only the apples do, but I still love this channel, and if your watching this video and your not subscribed, then what are you doing, tap that red subscribe button and that little thumbs up button if you like the video, and click that little bell icon if you don't want to miss any new uploads, it's all totally free, and you can change your mind at anytime
What about the most common fish and shell fish then?
MatPat: Eat your pokemon  Ads: Here's Pokemon unite and cute Pikachu
MatPat: Yes, they eat pokemon! Nurse Joy: *chuckles* I'm in danger.
That was a gabite
This is so horrible. Pokémon are your friends 😱😭 how could someone eat their friend?
One important factor in what gets eaten is utility.  If a pokemon is very useful for some specific work, it will likely not get eaten (battling doesn't count since any pokemon can do that).  For instance, the only reason we don't eat dogs in real life is because we have better uses for them.
Ha! Something I’ve thought of many times 😂
That GBA intro is kinda nice
Ok now do this episode, but for every region… kantonians are not eating  mudbray….
11:11 "Like the Dark-type Mukrow"  It's "Murkrow." You left out the "r" between the "u" and the "k." You fused Muk and Murkrow together without even realizing it.
Not done watching the video so I may have to correct myself here, but at 5:45 when you say that they save 40% on chicken compared to pork and beef, didn’t you forget to account for the fact that pigs and cows are much heavier than any chicken?
I think food theory is probably the best place to suggest you read Drifting Dragons and their Recipes for dragon meals.
I've heard  that  insects could potentially be a more economic source of protein, its just not as appealing to people
Always wondered how they got eggs in their food in the anime.
I gotta try cooking Slowbro on my pokemon unite
'America has a lot of water" Cries in Californian
Great video, but a few things you didn't take into account First- in the real world, the main reason certain animals are farmed and others aren't, has to do with social structure. Animals that are highly social (cows, horses, chickens, goats) are much easier to domesticate and therefore farm than animals that aren't (consider how we can domesticate horses but not zebra. Zebra live in large herds, but don't have a social hierarchy) The other, less important thing you didn't mention is that many Pokemon are not made up of "meat" like a lot of ground or rock types are weird sentient rocks, and I think mudbray falls into this category of being ground type and most of its body weight being mud or rocks or something
Boop
Ahh I miss that game boy intro
We all know that vegan teacher is gonna cry over this
This guy really reminds me of that Mat pat over on game theory
Scientists say: Eat a Pokémon a day, keep the Pokédoctor away!
MURkrow
But applin is not the Apple
I enjoyed the gameboy intro
One of these days? I want that Pokemon farm simulator now!
This is horrifying yet super interesting
That thumbnail is SO CURSED! LOL!
But have we considered the possibility of inedible pokemon? Like the ones made of stone, metal or *MUD*? I don't actually know of mudsdale is made of mud, but it definitely looks like it is
Oh the vegan teacher would have a fit over this
Or how about don't!
You heard of Brian David Gilbert?
Delta Labs is the gre- wait what is that!-the last words of the Jr top scientist during the 2017 incident
Ah yes i'll definitely EAT THE LEGENDARY POKEMON GOD OF LIFE
The amount of times he said edible  ☟︎
I mean, in terms of pokemon, Vaporeon...
so, the clothing its made of the wool of the wooloos? 🐑 = 👕?
So what happens if you evolve the most edible Pokémon ever?
The applein is just a worm in a apple
So this is where Pokémon vore came from
This could’ve been on any of the channels
Thatveganteacher has found her next target, Take cover
I raise chickens for eggs. Killing them is evil My chickens love hugs
I mean, Pokemon are sapient creatures. That'd be like eating another person or an alien
Its funny I read the title then I clicked and got a pokimone ad
There is Non pokemon fruit in the pokemon world- but it’s always been canon that humans in the pokemon world see pokemon as ‘Exotic’ expensive Food. Pokemon are NOT the plants and animals of our world, there are plants and animals in the pokemon world that aren’t pokemon.
Hi matpat
"Eating Nurse Joy..." Umm, phrasing?
do you ever think that people didnt give a ahit when deciding the pokemon weights
Where's the blue channel
Chef PK should do a collab where he makes a dish based off of these edible Pokemon.
Actually, Applin is just the wyrm. It hides itself IN the apple, only truly fusing with it if it's given a sweet enough apple. If it's given a sour tasting apple, it stops eating its apple and instead uses the "shell" as a tool for flight!!
wow intro :D
MatPat: Eats Applin   Me:Applin isnt the apple its the worm.
If you think about it where does all of pokemons meat come from if there are only pokemon and no normal animals
11:17 omg its Jet Erikson himself
So… Exeggcute or Chansey?
Rule 34 artists are way ahead of you on this.
7:37 Sir that is not a Garchomp, that it is a Gibite.
Never knew Nurse Joy was food.
Ill eat out nurse joy if she a pokemon
Would Torchic taste like teriyaki chicken? Could you consume a Slurpuff as cotton candy? I scream, for I have made myself hungry
MatPat: Any civilian can eat on a daily basis   Shows Nurse Joy
Fun fact, Mudsdale's weight actually makes sense. Its based on the Clydsedale horse, which average between 1700 and 2200 lbs.
I got a pro-vegan ad before this vid 😂
Gotta eat them all!
The of a magikarp can be revive if you  put the bone in the water
I think this should be on your "All of the Above Theory" channel
But which pokemon would be kosher?
This is interesting.
You better hope The Vegan “Karen” Teacher doesn’t see this
matpat, just one huge oversight. chickens are NOT the most efficient source of protein. bugs are! the real money is in farming caterpies and wurmples!
So... if Pokemon really were akin to humans at one time, then according to this theory, doesn't that mean that the people in the Pokemon world are... cannibals?
Did nobody see how he also uploaded on game theory that "Nurse joy is a pokemon"?
Wait whats the 4th theory real life theory SOMEONE DO A THEORY ABOUT THAT
I bet they eat Arcanines
If I had access to snow crab on a buffet I would eat many pounds per week.
Are there any normal animals in Pokemon or have they been all replaced by Pokemon?
Eating Nurse Joy, huh?
That Vegan Teacher is typing…..
7:34 ah yes, "Garchomp", clearly not Gabite
Farm raised Magicarp and rattata (It's local, it's renewable..)
Considering their close biological relationship to humans, eating them would be considered bushmeat.  Eating other apes is also where the scientific community believes AIDS came from too.  In conclusion, they better be really tasty.
I've..never actually thought about it like that This video just feels wrong
Ok well didnt know this video was going this way but whatever
so what does a Pikachu taste like then
Now there is one other factor that Mat forgot to mention and it would be interesting to figure out. The various types of berries that can be grown in the pokemon world. Which ones would make the best crops based on the following factors;  1) How long does it take them to grow? 2) What special affects they might have? 3) How many usually grow on one plant? 4) Could you realistically grow enough of them to feed a person?
ok so what I got from the first few minutes of this episode is Matpat thinks nurse joy is edible
(watches the other video before this one) FEAR
Wait, it doesn’t make sense because when pokemon die they don’t leave meat or bodies. The proof is on sun and moon, stoutland die and didn’t leave bodies or meat.
The big issue I see with Mudbray and it's evolution is that that weight comes in near pure muscle most likely, and with muscle being more dense than fatty meats like beef, it would also mean that it is much harder to cook,  takes longer and needs a lot more preparation to tenderize and prepare unless of course you like the feeling of eating a hard rubber.
6:34 best scene in the video
He did catch a herd of Tauros in season 1... Why else would he catch so many?
😭 Bruh you mispronounced so many names
wait that wasnt a garchomp that was a gabite
"David Bowie-Sensei, can I ask you a question?" - Sasuke  "Go ahead." - Kakashi/David Bowie  "If we're in ancient feudal Japan, how come we have cinema and movie cameras?" - Sasuke/David Bowie  "Y'know Sasuke, there are just some questions you just don't ask. Like, do Pokemon Trainers actually eat their pokemon?" -Kakashi/David Bowie  LittleKuribo's Abridge Series' really aged like frozen fine wine didn't they?
MatPat using what looks like the JoshDub intro.
Nice number Mat
That’s Gabite, not garchomp
Time to eat my chamander!
Mat: “Nurse Joy is a Pokemon.” Also May: “Pokemon should be eatab.” Also Mat again: Proceeds to use nurse joy as an example to represent a civilian in the start of the video 3:10
When it comes to milk production Miltank would probably be much better than Skiddo. Multiple Pokédex entries state that Miltank produces over five gallons of milk daily and as far as I know there are no goat species that produce that much milk. Skiddo would reach maturity faster than Miltank but once Miltank is mature enough to produce milk it would vastly out perform Skiddo in terms of how much milk they can produce on a daily bases. That's why I think even though Skiddo would be excellent for producing milk it wouldn't be the main source of dairy in the Pokémon world.
I’ll tell you which Pokémon I’d eat, nurse joy.
i-
Wouldn't Kangaskhan be a possible choice? It literally big enough to carry a baby after hatching
Thanks for the meal ! PS: Humm... outout...
In very poor and I'm curious  How long can i live soley on Ramen noodles
Hi Mat wailird actually weighs  less then air
All of this talk about meat is making me hungry : (
Fun Fact: Applin is a wyrm in an apple
Mmm nurse joy
Applin sorry if im miss spelling it but he's the worm in the apple not the apple
WHAT ABOUT FISH?????
Eat miltank
EAT YOU'RE CARING AND LOVEING PET    the food theorists October - 2021
My parents just found a photo of 4 year old me trying to eat my Pikachu plushie  😭😭😭😭
Oh come on. It's been ages since Ash last saw a Koffing he was just refamiliarizing himself with it like you would with spotting a rare animals you hadn't seen or looked up in years.
This would be more accurate if you accounted for the fact that equine meat is toxic to humans
I am surprised that big Pokémon where not talked about, as a there are people who consume lots of bugs in real life as they are really quick to grow, cost little labor, and are high in protean as well as being calorie efficient
Me: *making a food farm* Me: oldest chicken dies
not really sure why i’m asking for an ena theory on food theory but eh?
One Problem: Good luck trying to take a pokemon to the slaughter while it hypnotizes you or hyper beams you into nothing... The real question is: Are pokemon even healthy enough to eat? If my prime beef was able to breath fire when it was alive, I'd don't know if I'd eat something like that...
Um, what?
This makes you wonder what nurse joy tastes like...
Nurse joy here I come
Where do they raise cattle for 3 years before slaughter we raise them for 9-14 months usually
I think that analyzing the fruit/vegetable Pokémon in this manner wouldn't really work. Unlike meat, the nutrition and whatnot of plant-based food is really difficult to tell at a glance. Of course, it's not like the animal Pokémon will be exactly like their real-life counterparts either, but there is a much higher rate of plants looking similar to each other despite having different nutritional values.
But mudbray is so cute
yummy gardevoir mhm **yum**
Sorry Matt watched three minutes of this and my inner child just can’t handle the reality of this episode.
MatPat: "The only things that outclass it in weight are legendaries!" Also MatPat: "Shows pics of Metagross and Celesteela" Me: *Internally screaming*
Wait...this feels like like this should be a Film theory video. But at the same time its about food. ....uh.....(👁👄👁)
Nurse Joy is the most edible, duh!
Surprised you didn't say Magikarp would be a really good option, since its incubation time was so short, and it was so plentiful in the wild. Not to mention, it's a much bigger fish than you'd think.
*Says garchomp* *Shows Gabite*
based
Can't imagine eating a fire type Pokemon, it's not like you can cook it because it can't be burned
You know what has a 100% caloric efficiency… Vegetables.
People like to eat owls in pokemon? sheesh...
If pokemon were real they would be very screwed in every sense
1:40 I thought that was a joke 😱😱😱
The 69th video of Food Theory. Nice
Okaaaay, but what if I wanna hog tie and roast a big fuckin’ Dragon? How much meat and calories would come from something like a Dragonite? I mainly wanna do that cause I enjoy things being absurdly difficult.
I ask my mom if she wants to watch the vid then I told her what it is about and she wants to ask if your ok ?
thats a gabite
DONT YOU DARE TOUCH MY BABY APPLIN
mukrow?
Now all you need to do is do a film theory on Pokemon and it can join FNaF in being covered by all your channels!
Gotta catch 'em all? More like...Gotta Eat 'em All!
Slowpokes, mainly Slowpoke tails. Since gen 2 it's been stated that slowpoke tails and delicious and they grow back in a few days after being cut off. In later games it's a food item you can eat.
I like to think that farmers in Galar try to mass produce Exp candies.
Insects have a much higher caloric efficiency than poultry. In a world with giant bugs running around, wouldn't the most efficient source of meat be something like a Grubbin?
YES
one slight flaw in this video, hoot hoot is an owl, and owls eat meat (such as small mammals, insects and even other birds). this means that for every hoot hoot you wanted to raise you'd need to raise (or capture) large amounts of rodents (such as rattata), this inherently makes their meat much less efficient than you have suggested, because you would need to have lots of land to grow the grains for the rodents to eat just to feed the rodents to the hoot hoots
How about fish?
Wow they should create a pokemon farm  game
The fastest way to hatch eggs is by having pokemon with flame body/lava armor. Also you can level up pokemon really quick if you've already beaten the elite four and have one main pokemon who can body them. Bonus points if your tank is level 100 so all the exp goes to the rest of your party
The incorrect pronunciations got me like bruh
I feel like typing should play a factor. Like mudbray and other rock or ground Pokémon are probably more mineral than meat haha.
Ive been wondering something like thos for YEARS, where do they get meat for burgers, from pokemon? This is the closest thing to that. Thank you.
Eat topoo coco
ThatPokéVeganTeacher be like: No! Don't eat the poor Pokémon! They are pets and companions for training!
So.. team rocket were actually on to something when they were chopping off slowpoke tails 🤔🤷🤤
Um,, age in Pokémon isn’t equivalent to level. Level 4 doesn’t mean it’s 4 years old n
7:34 I’m not the only one who noticed am I?
Would plant type Pokemon be made of plant stuff or animal flesh?
i bet that vegan teacher and her stands would hate this video lol
Is someone Gunnar tell him mudbray is made of mud?
0:00 General Kenobi, you're a bold one.
This world is inhabited by creatures called pokemon Me who watches game grumps: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
Kiawe has a farm in the sun and moon anime with Mudbray, Miltank, Tauros etc.  Also Mudbray won't be hard to raise, it eats MUD.  you better believe business is booming
Definitely gotta be nurse joy
Garchop = gabit yes
We should all eat Nurse Joy, that's my takeaway from this.
The imagery of Miltank lactating and breastfeeding other Pokemon might haunt me tonight.... Also, MattPat truly has an innocent mind to suggest eating Nurse Joy to people.  😏
Sus
I haven't seen all of this video, but im gonna say Magikarp is the most consumed because it is just a normal fish
Me playing pokemon: Sorry Incineroar I don't have any more beans or berries Incineroar: Looks at Mudbray seductively
I’m pretty sure if you said you ate owl and donkey meat in real life, you would get some weird looks.
Did anyone else notice that they showed a Gabite when he said Garchomp?
I wonder if Mat knows that isn't garchomp....
Didnt bdg make a video similar to this?
Pooor alpin!!
Mudbray is only found in two regions and skiddo is only found in ONE, they don't seem very efficent to me, unless you want to ship them absolutley everywhere, which you might... (Didn't people do that?)  Oh, and hoot hoot is found in 5 regions.
"MatPat" calls gametheory a sister channel. "Me" you mean Mother Channel
I WANNA PLAY A POKEMON FARMING GAME
wow i love pokemon so much and this is the video that gets released on my bday xD
7:34 thats a gabite
normal people pokemon equals game theory matpat FOOODDD
9:05 but what about exp candies
Me reading the title: am I reading this right?
*I know what I'm doing today*
That's a Gabite,not a Garchomp
According to Pokemon sword's entry, mudsdale hardens mud around it's legs (orange bands) which adds to it's weight, but is not edible. Please check with a Poke professional before posting inaccuracies.
Happy 69th video
Does that mean that vegans in the pokemon world eat the fruits and veges produced by grass types, such as Tropius's bananas?
#thankmas
This is actually normal in nintendo games like splatoon
i hate how he said “Garchomp” yet puts a picture of Gible
But think how much meat u could harvest if u raised magicarp farm that evolves them. U could also have them fight between each other to not waste your time traveling and finding weak enough pokemon to have them fight it. or U could have them eat their young like some animals
Oh my gosh I always watch it on the TV I liked and subscribed to all of your videos
how would a legendary taste?
Must consume Arceus
Oh, I'm definitely down to eat Nurse Joy "if you know what i mean!" lmao
Finally, a food theory relevant to one of my weirdest interests.
Uh did anyone notice at 7:35 matpat says garchomp but at the end it shows gabite? Sorry for bringing up this fact just I pay attention to the small details
God im so glad to be vegetarian.
time to eat out nurse joy wait
But the real question is how would they taste. lol
I now understand why some people become vegan. 😰
why don't we have a video about the morality of eating pokemon?  Aren't they sentient fully intelligent creatures on par with humans?  we even know from meowth that they can learn to speak human language if they actually try, and psychics can communicate telepathically with humans often.  Wouldn't killing and eating pokemon be murder or even a sort of cannabilism?
"Like dragonite, tyranitar, and garchomp" *Images for dragonite, tyranitar and gabite appear.*
Fun fact: applins aren’t apples, they are dragon worms(Wyrms) inside apples
Hi
My head cannon has always had the Dr in pokemon go owning at least one fast food chain and all those pokemon that get transferred to him end up as some type of meal. Certain things like the electric and fire are used for those,sold to home development for furnace and electric. The fridge might be cheaper to just run off electric rather than feed another pokemon. Most of the rest end up in various other eateries the doc owns
Matpat assuming bellsprout and Tangela are actual plants instead of an animal or bug type that use plantlike appearance to camo in the real world! If anything I think plant pokemon might not actually be living plants!
Did anyone else notice that the editor put in Gabite when Matpat said Garchomp lol
7:31 that’s a weird looking Garchomp
matpat: the pre-evolved forms of Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp the editors: Dragonite, Tyranitar, Gabite
Nice garchomp
When you chose Hoothoot you forgot the obvious problem of "predators are never economic sources of meat." It's a Great Horned Owl, Mattpat. It's not just a predator but an apex.
So now there a theory about nurse joy being a pokemon and what Pokémon should you eat. Now then raises a question.   What type of food did humans or Pokémon eat back then if Pokémon and humans use to be the same or live the same?
what about chansey? its egg is said to be highly nutritious and it can produce multiple per day. its levelling rate is fast as well. those pokemon centers could serve some good breakfast.
That into, I loved it to much
Skiddo is pronounced like the word "kiddo" with an S, I'm pretty sure. I think it's a reference to the word kid, which is a word for a young goat. EDIT: Also, you skipped the first R in Murkrow. Its name is a fusion of "murder" and "crow."
But raptors have terrible tasting meat. it is apparently really tough and rancid tasting. Not sure you would want to go with owl meat.
That Title Card hit me with nostalgia
it's not a good idea to use big Pokémon such as the whale because the risk of them getting sick is inconsistent and if an animal ever dies of sickness or spontaneously you can't eat it and certainly not sell it.
Okay, but I was kinda looking forward to learning what the most efficient choices per region were. Hoot-Hoot and Mudbray can both be found in Alola and Galar, and both Skiddo and Hoot-Hoot can be found in Kalos, but other than that only Hoot-Hoot can be found in the other regions, and even it can't be found in Kanto. And heck, that's not even considering side game regions. Importing meat costs money, y'know?
If the majority of Mudbray's weight comes from having more dense muscles rather than larger muscles, you're definitely not going to want to eat it.
ah yes the dark part of pokemon that they dont want to show
When he says garchomp the pic is the pre Evolution lol
"Why do we use "use" specific animals for food. Typo on 3:52 (Amazing channel btw)
Using "poultry" instead of "paltry" I hear you MatKing
So... Is eating nurse Joy cannibalism?
This was a lot of fun ^^ I *will* point out that as Hoothoot is a predator, like any owl, they might not actuallybe such a natural choice for poultry farmers. You'd have to provide meat for them to eat, and enough to fatten them up. Furthermore, as a predator they would be far less docile and generally require much more work to handle (being a pokémon might mitigate this problem). Finally, (it just hit me while writing) as owls are solitary predators, you would either require a lot of land per Hoothoot or have to put in a lot of work to prevent conflict between them.   Basically: Unlike grass, mice aren't free.  Some species of Pokémon display herd behaviour, making any species that doesn’t, an inefficient source of meat.
It always surprises me how little Lamb/Mutton is eaten or even remembered as a meat source in the US unless it's a very expensive, high-end restaurant meal. Particularly with the abundant green space for raising large flocks the US has.   In the UK it's equal in popularity to beef or pork (and in certain areas more common). Especially when you think about Sunday roasts, mince and shanks.  Beef will always be the go-to for steak but ties with lamb for stews and pork is usually the preference for chops. But Shepard's pie, Irish stew, pasties, lamb roasts with mint sauce, lamb shank in red wine and lamb sausages are widely eaten as a regular part of the diet here.
Now we wait for @WolfeyVGC to react to this one
For Mudbray or Mudsdale I wonder how much of it's weight is edible. I bet most of wailord is edible.
I would eat nurse joy ;)
"I wanna eat Nurse Joy" That sounds so wrong.
Where do you think the burgers come from
Why didn't you talk about chansey eggs?
vore
He said garchomp then preceded to show gabite
Ok, so I'm gonna go eat my weedle now. Wonder what it'll taste like.  Wait a second if nurse Joy is a Pokémon...
Mudbray probably tastes like dirt, though. I'll be eating Hoothoot, exclusively.
*France would like to know your location*
Can’t wait for vegan teacher to review this one
I feel as if since you take exp into account you should do evolution because you pokemon evolve after reaching a certain level
Nurse joy
ive got 3 exams today yet this is what im doing
Well,considering POKEMON's universe doenst have animals like ours,but its only pokemons,so its quite obvious,idk why that should be a theory
This doesn’t surprise me for you to make this logical point
7:34 that’s actually Garchomp’s pre-evolution Gabite😂
“Most Pokémon could be eaten if we try”  Me looking at my Muk and magenemite: Well let’s figure this out.
Just had a thought... I will now always call cows and the like "Grass to meat/milk converters"
but like. How do you cook a pokemon. If charizard's flamethrower aint cutting it then what will
So, today matpat made a collab with himself where he both explained that nurse joy is a pokemon, and asked what pokemon he should farm to eat. hmmmmmm
- you are a vegetarian in the Pokemon world - you go to the grocery store and buy plant-based Pokemon meat - you serve it to some non-vegetarian friends in hopes of convincing them that vegetarian options can be just as good. Your friend take a bite and remarks "Wow! This is so impressive, it's vegetarian?? It tastes EXACTLY like real Bulbasaur!!!" - you start sweating - you excuse yourself to the kitchen and remove the package from the trash - you stand alone with your thoughts as you read the phrase "plant-based Pokemon" on the packaging over and over
Y'all playing Deltarune on GTLive ? :D
Eating pokemon helped me get shredded.
But can we eat nurse joy?
My favorite Pokemon is milktank lol
So your saying we should eat the pokemon and nurse joy is pokemon. So eat nurse joy since they are not actually a person. ;-;
Oh my god... Hoothoot is just a giant drumstick...
P=Q, Q=R, therefore P=R. Matthew PATRICK! (If you don’t get it check out the new game theory video)
A video about how we should eat our Pokémon... alongside a video claiming that Nurse Joy is a Pokémon...  So what you're saying...
This ignores some important factors with the milk, even if Miltank takes longer to grow to maturity, each Miltank almost definitely produces an absurd amount of milk more per day per Miltank than a Gogoat.   The average dairy goat produced about 3-4 liters of milk a day, and doubling weight would maybe increase that by half, but to be generous even if it doubled that would still be less than half of the extremely calorie and nutritionally dense Miltank milk of 5 gallons a day.  Hoot hoot is also based on Owls, an obligate carnivore, which people don't tend to eat because they have extremely lean meat that tends to taste less good and be by and away less calorie efficient because you have to multiply however many calories they need to gain one calorie by how many calories their prey needs to eat to gain one calorie.  Nothing wrong about Mudbray though.
Ok but isn’t applying not the apple 🍎 but a snake thing inside the apple
9:58 Mat....Erikaaaaa tututut  I think i understood that one
Brian David Gilbert is probably gonna lose his mind when he sees this video.
Everything is edible just sometimes only once
Gotta feed them all
Magikarp is not a useless Pokémon. They make a fine fish fillet.
6:34 thank you, matpat. No one needed this image but here it is.
The same creatures humans had intimate and romantic relationships with, in the old times, are also their food sources.  Kinda strange, isn't it?
Actually created a minecraft modpack called PixelBomb based on this where you have to eat the pokemon
Aplins do not grow on trees aplin is a worm inside an......WAIT SINCE WHEN ARE THERE APPLES IN POKEMON
Seafood option: Magicarp Cannibalism option: Nurse Joy
0:20 um mat you just ate a bug applen is the worm not the apple
I already guess that
Which plant Pokemon would make good liquor? 🤔
Lol this is the 69th Video
7:33 Not to be that guy but what you said was Garchomp it's actually Gabite
Can't believe we didn't talk fish. Magikarp is everywhere and extremely easy to catch. I imagine in coastal regions that's the only meat they got, like the prevalence of seafood in New England
MatPat once hunted, finished tonguing, and ate an entire Wailord in a single day. After doing the math, he determined Wailord was pound for pennies the most economical farming pokemon.
I mean dorkly already made that joke Italy someone notice! given if you didn't know
Am saying am mad cuz you sould found out that you can eat them am just disappointed
What the fu-
Not gonna lie I'm disappointed in this one MatPat. Pokemon still eat food, and you didn't factor in the cost of feeding them. A snorlax may weigh 200 lbs more than a wailord but im pretty sure it eats significantly more in mass seeing as it has cleared entire forests and I think wailord just eats plankton
The only thing about this is that mudbray is only native to alola. It would cost a lot to transport it. I think  that Alola is pretty far away from the other regions too(like Unova).
One slight thing you missed accounting for regards the hatching of pokemon. You can cut the hatch times in half if you have a pokemon that has the Magma Armor or Flame Body abilities... and Steam Engine in gen 8... such as Slugma/Magcargo, or more appropriately, Talonflame.  It would make sense that if pokemon were to all come from eggs, farmers would also be raising families of tamed Talonflames that could sit on/nest with any eggs produced, thus hatching them twice as fast and allowing farmers to raise new livestock a lot quicker, meaning those ones like Chansey (with it's ~10k step counter) would be just as fast to hatch as Mudbray would without the extra heat.  To add to that, you mention about how farmers wouldn't be out evolving pokemon... but given how large some of these can get, Mudsdale in particular (which would be mostly strong muscle meat), it might be worth the effort.  You should also add in the idea of Bug pokemon. Insects are eaten, quite frequently, in the real world. If we're talking mere weight vs time/resources spent, I'd say that Ladyba (~4k steps hatch count, 10.8kg at hatch, and with a Fast levelling rate) would likely be a big candidate for most eaten... Ladian even moreso, as it more than triples in weight once evolved (though likely at least 1/3 of that will be inedible carapace), and only needs to be Lv18. Thus would require far less food and training to evolve, so more could be fed and raised at a single time.
POW! Right in the childhood!
Problem is that mudbray or the other pokemon mentioned arent in every region
The only Pokémon I don’t recommend Dragon types, legendary, rock, steel, Ghost, and Poison Pokémon maybe Fire
I personally headcanon that they all eat vegetarian meals instead of eating pokemon but that's just me wanting to avoid eating a pokemon that, by your info from the other video you put out, could possibly be a person.
The video I just watched: Nurse Joy is a Pokemon The video I am currently watching: Yes you should eat you Pokemon    Hmmm what does that sound like? Hint: It has to do with humans
There are regular animals in the anime But yeah I’ll eat a Nidoking
Heres a follow up theory. Have grass pokemon just evolved from plants? We have berry pokemon and actual berries, what if the normal berries just arent as obvious that they are alive?
How many of your theories do you actually believe? This goes out to the viewers, too: How many of MatPat's theories do you actually turn to your own headcanon about whatever he's talking about and take to heart as - at least to some degree - fact? (Beyond the *actual* facts he uses to justify his theories)
Appleton is not temple but yep that would faint it
This is why I subscribed!
What about sea good? Just load up on magikarps?
Cute creatures that you captured and eat , geez what is this? BUGSNAX!    Does anyone remember bugsnax?
Gotta eat 'em all.
Um…duh! I thought it was canon Brock cooks up Magikarp?

What about the statistic of how hard they are to murder? While hoot hoot is great it feels hard to raise because of it being a night Pokémon and some are rather unruly. (Also magikarp seems kinda delicious but dangerous because of Gyrados canon.)

Everybody chillin till Pokémon ends up on food theory
But are you sure that the horse is 900kgs of meat
Me: confused screaming
If only there was a way to speed up lvling pokemon....oh wait rare candies and whatever the daycare center does
On the point about most farmers aren’t going to take their Pokémon to fight so they can evolve:  There was an episode of Pokémon where a woman needed Ash’s help to evolve her Paras because it could only make a special medicine in its evolved state. So, that’s a little different obviously, but it does show it could be possible farmers might be willing to have their Pokémon fight and evolve IF necessary.
I was confused on why was this a food theory then I read the tittle…………
In the card game Pokemon eat humans.
In Early Gen 3 games there's an npc that can tell you the exact size of a specific fish pokemon in your party. The goal was to find the exact size he's looking for. I wonder if the way the game detected size in that game can play a role in this farm simulator
Matpat- "We won't be considering evolutions" Matpat not even two seconds later: "let's look at skidoo, and its evolution...."
7:37 says garchomp, shows gabite
Bring out your GUNS AND KIDS
Hoot hoot is mostly feathers like an actual owl
Now we need to see if Nurse Joy eats meat...
I got a fourth channel idea for you Mattpat All Theory
hold up this video is about eating pokemon and the other is about people being pokemon.......... this is not added up
7:35 says Garchomp and shows a picture of gabite. 12:48 mega metagross is not a legendary pokemon.
The most surprising thing in this video for me was that the cost of producing beef is less than pork.
Ayy, my theory got turned into a video, kinda.
the music is an absolute bop
did anyone else see that he has Gabite in place of garchomp
7:36 Garchomp???????????? That’s the pre-evolved form Gabite .Garchomp has grim reaper syche lookin arms and is more reddish than gabite
Gabite = Garchomp
I know this is a video about fictional animals and their meat, but since MatPat brought it up, I beg you to try horse's and donkey's meat. Trust me, is waaaayy more delicious than cow meat. Maybe MatPat could make a Food Theory video about which meat is the tastiest(?) Just throwing this idea at you MatPat **wink wink**
You forgot to separate it by region, much like beef is rare in Korea due to shipping, mudbray would be rare in Kanto
Why Matpat????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????? Why!!!!????????                                   #don'teatpokemon       #savethepokemon
As someone that was just recently enrolled in Furry Curriculum of professor Culture Lando, that's going to the number 5 scale bud. If in the sense of eating you mean on the title is not the chewing kind.
I get my protein from BEANS!!!
Thats a good theory! Just one question though, If you recognize that plant pokemon are made of plant matter rather than meat, doesn't that suggest that Mudsdale is probably not made entirely of meat, but rather some combination of meat *and earthen material?* Mudsdale has the mass to ease of raising ratio, but it probably isn't entirely edible.
Why
And the bit discussing the weights of different Pokémon clearly shows us one thing: Game Freak had no idea what they were doing when deciding the weights of Pokémon
POEMON! GOTTA EAT THEM ALL
THIS WAS EVEN CONFIRMED ON THE FIRST SHOW ON THE SHIP EPISODE THEY HAD COOKED MAGICARP
Just hit the bird weight section and Hoot Hoot is 11lbs heavier than the worlds heaviest flying bird. Also Noctowl is almost 90 lbs.
Please remember that lobster crab and shrimp used to be a nuisance until the 1880s when canning and the building of the US railways and fully boomed as a delicacy by WW2. So in reality, Lobster is just a perceived delicacy when it's quite cheap and easy to farm.
Delicous
Magikarp definitely makes the sushi list. Those fishermen are trying to make their money 💰
once again, you've fallen behind brian david gilbert, the man with three first names!
I mean...maybe not YOUR pokemon but a pokemon.
This is so limited in scope. Why no bug types? considering IRL many countries do eat insects? What about eggs, I know the Blissey line is supposed to produce edible eggs? If we are going by weight would milktank be a good choice as it is born fully evolved?
Brock was onto something about nurse Joy
5:56 he said beef provides a poultry 1.9%. That's confusing🙃
That's a gabite, not a garchomp
I agree with the first 2 pokemon, but if you expect someone to farm a 1 ton megahorse that can use earthquake and has skin that gets 50% tougher everytime you hurt it then goodluck. 😆
i think you forgot about the INSANE quantity of milk 1 Milktank can make
I’m scared that MatPat is going to eat nurse Joy
We all know the only food they eat are X-speeds and X-attacks
Hey, how come there’s no chicken or turkey pokemon? Though I guess they wouldn’t be flying type, which could be confusing
Considering that Pokemon are both sentient and sapient? It is very disturbing that Pokemon are eaten.  What a screwed up world.
Anyone notice the gabite when he said garchomp
Thats Gabite 7:34
I dunno, I think Mudbray would be a bit gamey.
yeah I just keep at the plants that don't fight back
ME EATS A CHARZARD CARD
Did this man just call Skiddo “Skiddoo”?
Me thinking I was clicking game theory episode: (￣ヘ￣）ᵁᴹᴹ what is this?
Except owl meat tastes bad
...Did he just call gabite garchomp?
One thing that needs to be thought of aswell, and what wasn't taken into account here, is that meats from carnivores don't really taste as good as meats from herbivores. that's why it's rarer to eat dogs or other hunting animals. this might be with hoot hoot aswell. As an Owl type it might be carnivorous, so it's meat might taste less good than a seed or insect eating bird type.
Script says "Garchomp", Editor adds Gabite image.
I have long debated if it's still considered vegetarian or even vegan to eat many of the plant based Pokemon. I would argue that Skiddo isn't since it's part normal and a goat, but Oddish? Sure, that's pl=ure plant. But there's something else to consider on grass type Pokemon: the sheer number of ones that are also part poison type (especially in gen 1) I would have to argue a Tangela is more edible than a Bellsprout because Tangela isn't part poison type and I have no clue if the poison would affect humans (does it in the anime?)  Also, what about what fish would be best to eat in the Pokemon world? I want my seafood!
Did he just call gabite a garchomp?
MattPat you know fish also meat right? I don't know how it compares to poultry, pork and beef but it was definitely worth mentioning here. When I heard about edible Pokemon the first one that came to my min was Magikarp.
Wouldn't Game Theory be the Father Channel, since it started out everything else
This right here, is why I subbed to Game Theory.  As fun as the lore-diving of FNAF was, I still remember young matpat expounding on his theory that link was dead, or that using the hookshot even once would potentially ruin your entire body.   Now I'm learning which pokemon I should be raising for my Farmer John Nuzlock.  I also just realized Matpat forgot to account for the danger factor of raising these species for food.  Last thing I need is my future steak using Earthquake on its way to the slaughterhouse, or that skiddo using razorleaf on the poor sap milking them.
Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gabite
I wanna know what the deal with MissingNo is, like why does he persist across a couple games?
Is the Squid Game theory going on this channel or Film Theory?
Unnn... Hmmm...
Thank you for answering that question that I had for years.
7:33 thats a Gabite MatPat lol
As a *young* southerner who eats more than a pound of crab and crawfish everytime we get good seafood I was *SHOOKETH* when the average was only 1/3 pound Yes yes I know not everyone has it but someone who eats so much seafood and isn't even a teen yet this is SURPRISING y'all haven't been blessed with the good taste of seafood 😭😭😭
As a guy who is into the lore of pokemon, eating Pokemon (and pokemon eating other pokemon) is already something I am familiar with, it surprises me that a lot of other people didn't know that, I mean, they are animals, and there aren't any real animals in the world of Pokemon
i ate pikachu
Wait a minute...I just got done watching the game theory with nurse joy being a Pokémon. If that's the case and people & Pokémon were once the same wouldn't that make people cannibals technically? And if so does that make Pokémon cannibals too?
Food theory idea: Which restaurants has the least care about what they serve, and how they make it. Is the food we get really healthy?
"PIdgey clones" are Flying type birds that you catch early on in your pokemon run.  They're Early Birds
Fell over laughing at the idea of a vegetarian strangling a bellsprout for dinner.. I’m sorry to interrupt my own comment did Mattpat just tell us all to eat nurse joy? Is this the adult stream? Lol
Why just why
Sorry Matpat, im a super Canivorous Vegetarian. Gotta have that Sunflora snack.
did you take into account why mudbray and mudsdale are as heavy as they are? because that isnt meat its mud
I have a mini-food conspiracy theory. Remember last year they send meat has skyrocketed in price because of the Pandemic? Well Chicken is STILL the cheapest, so now you know why everyone and their grandma are making and promoting their New Chicken Sandwiches
Why does Ash need to pull out his pokedex to learn about Koffing.. He learned what a Koffing was back in Kanto.. through many encounters with Team Rocket...
IF POKEMON AND HUMANS USED TO BE THE SAME AND THEY EVOLVED THEN THAT IS CANNIBALISM
Since I moved to North America I was really surprised at how they were literally not selling mutton aka goat. Goat tastes so good it’s basically beef but I’m pretty sure it’s cheaper.
And if for some reason you want to eat Bones, Magikarps are your go to meal
Maybe a Miltank produces a lot more milk than a Skiddo, I mean, look at those utters
Someone (JWittz?) crunched the numbers and determined that Wailor's size/weight ratio us such that it would be less dense than air and float like a blimp.
Oh no, the should you eat pokemon question... is Matpat going to leave foodtheory?
day 3, going till 100 i am asking for you to make a video of the brazilian hot dog, AKA the 2 french bread, 3 sausages, mayo, mustard, katchup, peas, shredded cheese, potato chips, "catupiry" , cheddar, chicken, corn, bacon, peperonni, lettuce, and cut tomatoes and cut onions with vinegar, not necessarily in that order, AKA: the DOGÃO©™
me: watches this video for pokemon matpat: Ima teach you about economics me: IM NOT IN SCHOOL
In part 2, do more research on farming, fishing, Japanese diets, and especially on the pokemon you think people eat. There's no way HootHoot would be delicious, it's an owl, do you know anyone who eats owls? Dairy cattle aren't the ones you get meat from, and Mudsdale is a draught-horse pokemon, for pulling carts, not for eating. You didn't mention all of the dessert-style pokemon, I would think Vanillite would get a mention, or the 9+ flavors of Alcremie. The screen capture of the Magikarp from the anime was a good start, many fish pokemon should be in human diets, and perhaps we can bring awareness to the overfishing of Sharpedo.
My inner geek falls to his knees in agony when Matpat pokemon names. Seriously. Muck-row.
7:30 yeah... Definitely a Garchomp... Couldn't be a Gabite Nooooooo
That's not garchomp
Again I have a slight problem with this theory, You're considering all pokemon to be composed of meat like our animals are while pokemon like mudsdale likely have mud as part of their weight (As I said with corviknight being made of steel more than meat and thus normal biology would not apply to him)
Before you all ask why we eat such inefficient foods, capping below 25% efficiency, ask yourself whether or not you want to try and live off the livestock feed that animals eat instead.
Check out PokeToon
Who that’s  Snack it’s  Pikachu
Please tell me that MatPat knows that Applin is the worm INSIDE the apple …
Did anyone else think deerling would win. It saves space and money on shelter and energy for  heating or AC as they aaqpt to the seasons and venison is a popular meat irl
0:27 @TheFoodTherorists applin is actually the worm in the apple not the actual apple it's kinda like a hermit crab
I'd eat Nurse Joy
That is my alltime favourite intro
7:37 garchomp
You finally have 69 videos
I didn’t even watch this whole video, and I’m not eating my cutie pie daphidil
I'm good thank you.
I’m gonna predict this the answer is milktank. Edit: magikarp
Mudbrey is confirmed for best producer in sun and moon anime
Well I don't think you would have to train the livestock in the traditional way, you could probably release Pokemon they naturally feed on in the wild. Say you're raising hoot hoot to get your example of Noctowl you can just release rattatta into their enclosures and as they grow, start throwing Raticate into the mix to ensure evolution. Any pokemon fan will tell you that those are both fairly abundant and easy to catch pretty much anywhere
How dare you disrespect my favorite pokemon Garchomp but not that dirty dragon shaped balloon dragonite
Do starr park theory
What if the reason 'rare candy' is so rare is because it's a mostly industrial growth hormone that makes evolving pokemon in the industry that much faster. So for a normal civilian to get their hands on it, would be in itself a 'rare' opportunity.
I don't think that pokemon are edible
keep forgetting what i’m gonna comment on stuff like this…
food theory on paimon being emergency food when
this could fit any of the three theory channels
Oh my good God
Actually, for most of the early levels (after lv 6) the medium slow group actually grows faster than the medium fast group. This is the experience group used for starter pokemon. The reason the names are swapped is because the medium fast group DOES take less to get to level 100, catching up during the later levels. If we assume farmers aren't raising pokemon all the way to peak physical condition, more likely below level 50, then Tailow at 5.1 lbs would be the best choice. This is significantly less than Hoothoot however (46.7 lbs), so take that point of view with a grain of salt.
MatPat, you're forgetting one HUGE variable…usable meat.  Sure, Mudsdale is over 2k pounds, but how much of that is edible meat instead of bone.  Most horse meat is not to the human pallet.  The tenderloin is one of the few parts of the horse eaten with any regularity that humans actually from a horse.  Mudsdale/Mudbray also has a lot of dried mud adding to its weight.
“Pokémon like Garchomp,”  *shows picture of Gabite”
Yeah yeah that’s great matpat, but can I eat my charizard?
The tastiest pokemon is found at the end of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqzghgtJ1Is&ab_channel=Polygon
Not my squirtile
I didn't know how hypocritical I am. I felt it repulsive to eat pokemon, yet I am able to bear humans eating animals.
7:38. That's a Gabite not a Garchomp.
Disclaimer: don't
Tepig and Torchic.  Self-frying bacon and chicken.
! BDG didn't like that.
Vegans are gonna love this one
Miltank milk is more of a luxury. That stuff is so packed with nutrient that they can give pomemon hp. Plus it's meat is pretty good as well. Ratatas and other mouse pokemon as well as pidgy and pidove pokemon usually found on early routes are used by new trainers to eat on journeys. This is more likely fanon, but makes sense. Some pokemon are okay to eat while other, more humanoid or rare pokemon aren't.
I don't know man, those pokemon frecuently change genre... specie, phylum, some times even kingdom, I wouldn't eat them until I find an explanation.
(:
3:55 Why do we use use specific animals for food?  Ah yes I love to use use things.
What about sea food?
11:12 Muck row?
Alcremie skips the whole processing of the product to its final sellable stage, it just produces cream on command, they come in many flavors, can turn kaijuu, and to evolve it from Milcery all it needs is a sweet and someone to give them a spin around for 5 seconds.  However it wouldn't be profitable at all if it's so easy to produce, everyone would just own one or two.  For profitable farming it needs to be something hard enough that needs specialization and people at home aren't likely to spend time making themselves.
"PETA didn't like that."
Metagross is not a legendary
Wait but wouldn't you want to find the Pokémon that is overall bigger than heavier? I mean what if that donkey Pokémon had just very heavy bones or something? Because I don't think that donkey Pokémon is bigger than Tauros or some other bull/horse Pokémon.
what's the most popular food here? red: donke
Hey matpat I have question would a shiny pokemon taste better
There are also domesticated species. They lack intelligence and not so much pokemon, they can still use moves, but they really dumb. Like on the ranches.  Also slowpoke tail grows back so you can eat it just fine. They also have animals like cow and chickens, it's just that they are kept in facilities cause they would otherwise be extinct. I mean how do you think they get their eggs. Pokemon only lay eggs when there're fertilised
4:32 ah yes my favorite animal BEEF
this is cursed
Vegan teacher watching this be like: plants don't feel pain Pokemon do
Yes thank you matpat I eat electric eels so now I eat pikachu
hello
You will hear from PETA
So nurse joy is edible
Hello welcome to the world of free meals
there are skiddo and gogoat farms is x and y becasue there arent any miltanks in there on the other hand there is moomoo farm where there are miltank
Hi
Meanwhile at the Memphis Zoo Bar in the Pokémon universe:   Hmm... *I’ll take the Shuckle juice Icee, please.*
That wasn’t garchomp it was gabite the middle form
watching while cooking burger
this video made me miss dookished he was kind of a trend setter of eating pokemon
I mean, slowpoke tail and shuckle juice are a thing, so I can't say I'm surprised people eat pokemon
yum pokemon
PIKACHU I CHOOSE YOU... for the main course.
Bryan David Gilbert did  a great job talking about pokemon edibility
7:38 that’s a gabite, the prevo to garchomp
*MuRkrow… that is all
pocket monster rancher.
I find it odd that you landed on HootHoot as the bird of choice for meat, considering there is no precedent for humans consuming owl meat in the real world
Ash ketchup
Seeing a gabite get called a garchomp is the most offsetting thing for me
Ok then I'll make a pokemon themed restaurant we got Fried pikachu (i hate Pikachu) Slow cooked tepig Wishi washi sashimi And  Stantler venison
umm mat that's not vegetarian that's vegan that your thinking of
It for some FROG LEGS
But is it in the like in the anime and the manga involving is more based off of age and growth, minus the poke him on that you need to give like certain things
I know this is nitpicky but that is gabite not garchomp
Chickens are cheap partly because chicken feed is cheap in places like the USA. Cattle can be fed entirely from things people can’t eat, as can goats — another thing to consider. In the USA we’re a bit picky about what we feed pigs we plan to eat… they can basically eat food waste… It gets complex.
Imagine if Xiangling is in Pokemon
I will just eat them all I mean that make sense well my childhood is rudend
Applin is apparently not the apple, it's just a worm(wurm?), I know confusing.
imma go eat arceus
"Why try to have friends when you could just make a new channel and be you own best friend." Matpat has just summarized why I usually buy both versions of main series pokemon game instalments.
Cannibals trying to eat nurse joy. Wait a minute this taste like chansey.
Interesting
Do people even eat owls? Pretty sure they don't since they are carneverous, there's a reason We don't raise things like cats and eagles for food.
I expect that Magicarp would be commonly eaten as despite being small, they are fast growers and can't fight. Also, fancy food would probably be the evolved pokemon
7:33 nice looking garchomp 😂
watching this I couldn't help but think of the turkey versus chicken debate:  Turkeys are bigger and possibly more efficient than chickens, but people prefer chicken,  translating that to the pokemon world wouldn't this mean you forgot the consumer part of this transaction? yes efficiency is key, but what is hoot hoot just doesn't taste very good? Assuming it tastes like brown owl, brown owl tastes like absolutely poopie dook. so despite being a heavy bird it's quite possible no one would eat hoot hoot. Spearow I reckon would be close to something like sparrow, it would more like be the more prefered meat.  You also neglect that flying birds are often harder to raise, the reason chickens and turkeys are grand is cause they fly about as well as me flapping my arms.    . . . fun video though
#1: wailord is so light because they needs to so they can fly  #2: I guess that’s why mudsdale slaps
Now my mudbray will never look at me the same again
Not sure I can agree with Hoot-Hoot.  Owl's are carnivorous, and we usually don't eat (much less raise as livestock) carnivorous animals. Though I'm not sure what Hoot-Hoot uses as a food source.
This theory is soo completely flawed… Why are you looking at the levels? Pokémon don’t grow from getting levels… It’s not the same as them growing up! Also… Even if they did you already said they were not gonna fight… They only gain experience from fighting… So you would’ve had to look at the evolutions as well if experience was of any concern! O_o
So we are officially going back to ruining Childhoods with a new generation of children to traumatize? Good to know.
Ok but here’s a question. Is a Pokémon that’s about to evolve more nutritious than one that just evolved?
Just pray to Arceus that they don't come back as a ghost pokemon and eats you... and that is if you are lucky.... so don't eat your own pokemon... Don't make the first plan for season one come true.... the great pokemon revolution.
Hey heres a good theory idea do a theory about deltarune chapter 2 theres a few things going on like u need to make a theory about spamton or a theroy about kris being the dark night I NEED IT I NEEEEEEEED ITTTT
Oh yes, now deviant artists have more "content" with nurse joy. Thanks matpat, thank you for more pokemon nsfw.
Brian David Gilbert:  Are you challenging me?
did you just wake up one day and thought 'hmm a Pokemon sounds delicious!'
Poke-bowl.
Okay but Mattpatt didn’t you hear.   The MOST edible Pokémon has already been  revealed by Brian David Gilbert.
Pokémon gotta eat em all
Pikachu
Hey maybe something you could do is irl safety tips about anything and everything like at the end of episodes
nurse joy being a pokemon is not a fact
I was hoping that Mat would go over what Pokèmon would people eat based on Region? Because not all of these Pokémon can be found in every region. So if you don’t want exported meats etc and prefer locally produced foods, which Pokémon would you eat in each region?
I get my protein from fish
I did make an unofficial pokemon cookbook with the 1st 151 pokemon.
nah man, i get my pokemon wild, fresh, and raw
"All Hail Red Lobster!" 🙌🦞🙌
AYYYYY I LOVE FOOD THEORY NEXT VIDEO BE LIKE Yes  you have to eat paps spaggtie
This episode could also work on game theory and film theory
That Game Boy logo opening was everything right now
Bro I’m worried for mat’s mental health
Moral of the story: eat Nurse Joy 😏
They have berries so I figured they were all just vegetarian or vegan. I mean the berries are magical and many provide some weird benefits so I'm sure they could fine one that gives them all the nutrients they need
Reading the title I said: “SIR”
I bet there are people in the Pokemon universe that only eat the plant pokemon, kind of like pescatarians but with plant pokemon instead of seafood.
yes pokemons r animals so yes we eat them
I’m scared to unpauses
Finally now that this question has been answered I'll be able to sleep again at night...
Time to eat my Darkrai!
14:40 Ah, I just left a message saying that we can eat Nurse Joy.
I always wondered how a nurse joy tasted
Please do a Calvin and Hobbes theory
I bet officer Jenny's is the same thing
K.F.C  Kanto Fried Charizard
What a disturbing episode
14:41 I know of several people who would eat nurse joy ;)
“….Where else protien” -beans, nuts, legumes, seeds. Veggies (a gram or 2) and grains
12:48 Why did you include a metagross? It's not a legendary. Same goes for ultra beasts.
What about Magikarp
uP!
I know I now, this is stupid, but I rlly like pokemon and sorta instantly noticed he said Muckrow instead of Murkrow 11:11. What? I had to.
7:34 that's not a garchomp that's a gabite
Theory idea: what ice should you be eating
Problem with Hoothoot is that it’s likely carnivorous and carnivores don’t make good livestock, both because it’s difficult to feed them their natural diet/domesticate them at all and because carnivore meat has less energy per unit of mass. With this considered, you’d have a lot more factors going into which bird Pokémon is the most efficient to raise, sell, and eat
Eat nurse joy.
Personally, I like the concept that pokemon and real-life animals live along with eachother.
Science
it's not just hatching and growing, it's also about domestication and behaviour: a wild animal or one that's particularly difficult to keep under control likely isn't worth it. So you should actually take a step back and consider how likely it would be for a certain pokemon to be domesticated, and whether it would be well behaved enough.  One factor that is really important in domestication is how well the animal/pokemon is able to convert things which we can't digest, easily eat ourselves, or don't want to eat (although modern farming practices have gone beyond this efficient process into inefficiency of active feeding with things we can eat, or things grown on fields where we could grow human food) -Pigs are known for eating a lot of our food scraps. -Cows can graze pastures of grass which we don't eat ourselves. -Chickens grains which fall on the ground during traditional processing of grains and might be hard to all pick back up for human use.  Multiple uses out of one animal would've traditionally also been a factor in which animals get domesticated: -goats and sheep produce milk, meat, fur/wool, and leather -horses can be used for meat and leather, but also are very useful in pulling carts and ploughs and all that, and the meat tends to be more a by-product once they're not useful for their main function anymore. -Chickens provide eggs, and later meat and feathers
As a vegan I wouldn't eat pokémon either way.
7:56 Chickens don't reach full maturity in a month. Closer to 5 months to a year. Over a month is technically correct, but not close
AAHAHAHHAHHAHA WTF HAPPENED TO THE INTRO MOTTHER OF A TRUCK
A chicken with only 1 leg would be a problem on houses with two kids xD
Ratio
I'm a vegetarian. So I'll take some Oddishs and Bellsprouts.
Wouldn't the donkey a ,ground type, taste and be dirt and that is why this thing is a unit
I completely agree with the donkey and goat (assuming there are no social stigmas), but you're forgetting to account for taste. There is a reason we don't eat predatory birds, and it isn't just their size. Their diet makes the meat taste bad. So, I think owl, even Poke Owl, will have the same problem. It may have a lot of meat, but it will all taste bad.
Mat: >says Garchomp< Editors: >show Gabite<
im both fascinated and horrified by the info in this vid
I’ve always wondered if Tauros omelets taste like beef and if fire type Pokémon taste spicy
Did he say Mukrow rather than Murkrow?
When MatPat collabs with himself and accidentally brings back cannibal week.
Sooo, did the MatPat in the poke-universe try to eat an Abamasnow?.... which I think is the closest pokemon equivalent to a Pine tree (If I am wrong, replace the pokemon with the actual equivalent).
Considering that the world of Pokémon is heavily influenced by Japan’s real life culture and geography, I wonder why didn’t matpat look into the fishing industry as well. Maybe in a part 2? 🤔
7:33 MatPat says Garchomp while a picture of Gabite is shown
This isn't China
There’s actually another factor that might help with farming Pokémon; if you live in an area with a high rate of certain Pokémon appearing, you can easily just catch them instead of purchasing them from outside sources. Plus, Pokéballs are easily stored and can be bought at different tiers, so you can have thousands of Pokémon stored in Pokéballs that can be stored in a small shed.
And they called me crazy.
Imagine if thatveganteacher saw this video lmao
Me when Matt calls Gabite Garchomp
Food Theory Idea: How Many Possible Pringle Stacks Are There
I wonder how much of Mudbray's weight is just the bones
MMMMmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMM Pokemon
I am actually really interested about Pokemon Farming Simulator.
Sure, Mudbray might be the most efficient pick for red meat in terms of size and growth rate, but I'd bet it tastes terrible.
Woohoo o o oooooo o
I'd eat Gardevoir LuL
Umm, and right when you also make a video about Nurse Joy being a Pokémon…
Actually, we do eat ostriches. There used to be an ostrich ranch not far from my home in Illinois. Some local grocery stores carried it in their meat departments, the prices were comparable to high-end beef, like steak, and the taste and texture were more similar to beef than poultry. Ostrich, the other red meat.
*7:33* quite a young garchomp you have there
As a vegetarian I’m glad I don’t have to think about eating a pikachu
There are animals in pokemon. In the episode of the first season, that piggy that ash fought with caterpie, the piggy was eating a WORM!!! That's not a pokemon, right?
0:25 He should have said it tastes like chicken
Sorry but I had to say this I guess rare candies don’t know Exist
Not to mention goats are all skin and bones with very little true meat on them
I can’t eat my Mudbray or Mudsdale I was doing a Nuzlocke and named it Buffsuki so I can’t do that to Buffsuki
So... A restaurant called Hooters in the Pokemon universe... Are they literally just serving up Kentucky fried Hoot-Hoot?
I just started the video and I already now that Moral of the video: game theorists is a she
Wtf mat pat wtf
7:34 thats a gabite.
Not going to lie I get all my protein from Maccas
tasty pokemon
Casually ignores the fact that mudstale gets most it's weight from it's steel hair
Applin isn't an Apple though. Applin is the worm inside the apple.  But Miltank doesn't have to be evolved. It hatches as a miltank  Also also, why would we consider Numel if it would take a lot of heat to cook it since it's a fire type?
I think this is the worst theory on this channel yet
*backing away noises*
Matpat I think you failed to consider the different regions. Not all of these pokemon are prevelant in every region. In Kanto for example they might eat tauros for instance. Would make a nice series though if you decided to go into detail with what each region would eat!
hmmm, what about insect type pokemon since insects are a protein source in other parts of the world?
Now I’m protesting against Garchomp-Fin soup
I expected a section about seafood...
the reason we limit sea food is so we dont pay 10000 dollars on food
Applin isn't the apple but a worm inside the apple. Also Wailord is so light because It's the float whale Pokemon and It's body is mostly made up of air.
I don't think Hoothoot properly fits under the "chicken model." We don't eat owls, because they are carnivores and therefore not as energy efficient.
Food theory: yes you SHOULD eat your pokemon  Film theory: nurse joy is a pokemon Matpat are you suggesting that i....
What about Candy from pokemon?
Is scary that he said beef is a profitable animal
3 minutes in and my prediction is everyone’s eating rats and pigeons
Isn't horse meat really bad for you?
Oh I don't know Matt Pat maybe just make Make the game yourself
This isn’t really food theory
No, there are real animals, like worms and fish.
Would Lefeon be considered a meat or a vegetable then? It evolves from a mammal, but is a grass type, what does that mean MatPat?????
Did you know that if you drink to much of moomoo milk from miltanks you turn into a miltank!! Its in one of the pokedex entry’s.
Lotta bots in the comments
slowpoke tail : why did I start this
All those fish shaped Pokémon are suddenly very scared
Next episode should be about which Pokémon is the most compatible with humans other than vaporeon
7:30 I am not sure how a channel that is a sister channel to a video game channel got Garchomp wrong, but... Ya did XD
"Dragonite, Tyranitar, Garchomp *Shows picture of gabite*
THEORY O'S, I LOVE IT
Asking for the McDonald's ice cream machine conspiracy theory!
Goat simulaor dlc 3 or 4 is the first goat you see in the vid
"we could all end up eating Nurse Joy!"... lets bring back the fan art again! >:V! xD!! >:,D.... Oh Mat.. what have you done.
So, I have a toddler who likes to watch Pokemon Kids TV and this just made me think of the Old McDonald song. Mudrbray is definitely on that farm, Miltank too, but oddly they have Fearow as a turkey. So I feel there's gotta be some ranchers that raise Spearow until they evolve so they can have that delicious, Fearow "turkey" meat.
13:36 hmm should we tell matt that weight not equals musclemass? the weight could be mostly dense bones or organs. and as far as ya can cook bones and eat organs most people prefer muscles as food. not to forget that ya dont know what effects the meat of some pokemon could have. in the real world ya get sick if ya get too much colesterine and something equal bad could be possible in the pokemon world. also just because one pokemon breeds the fastest, hatches the fastest and grows the fastest to the biggest weight diesnt mean its economic. what food in what daily doses needs the pokemon to what expenses? how high is the fertility rate to breed? how many still births or other problems does the pokemon have? what pokemon parts could ya sell to what price other than the meat? what skills does the pokemon have that is useful to get money out of it? we mostly know absurd skills and attack or defend skills but what about skills that help grow plants, heal people or influence growth or more from other pokemon? and much more. interesting vidoe matt but sadly not enough infos to really decide the stable pokemon food.
↸╎ᒷ
Ok now I am going to make a Pokemon themed menu.
Definitely overlooking Tepig  He’s pre-cooked pork
OK I feel like the mudsdale can't be the much meat despite the weight it I feel like the bone density would just be much higher than most Pokémon especially considering the size
I have to say I disagree with your Hoothoot analysis. If you want to compare it to a real animal, it's obviously an owl. But do people eat owls? No, and that's because 1. they are not domesticable (not everything we eat has to be, but on a large scale - yes), and because 2. they are carnivores. So in reality based on their diets, it would take a LOT more calories to make a hoothoot than an herbivorous bird. That's why you don't see people commonly eating real owls, or bears, or wolves, etc.
The vegan teacher is shaking after this.
Does this mean Soylant Green is NOT made from people in the world of Pokémon? If so, then which Pokémon IS it made from?
Why do I feel like I watched this video before? Is it really just so similar to the other videos done on this topic and Mat is just rehashing old content again?
8:07 Just so let y'all know that veal (young cow) is DELICIOUS, so tender and mild, best cooked medium rare
The title of this video made me curious, so I clicked on it. Oh, and your Nurse Joy video was very interesting.
@ 7:34 sorry to be not picky, that is not garchomp, but I got the idea.
I finally got my Food Theory apron yesterday and I wanted to say that it's amazing...and I celebrated by making burgers. Guess I should have made donkey burgers XD
I wonder what Dragon Pokemon taste like, probably something tough and a little spicy
(insert eating nurse joy comment complete with "if ya know what I mean" here)
I would never eat my Pokemon Friends:( Would drink MooMoo Milk and make plenty of Cheese from that. Also I think in Pokemon world they have regular Chickens and Eggs so could do that.
Apples aren’t the apple but the worm inside of the apple still doesn’t account for why it’s a dragon type
7:37 where garcomp its gabite
BDG (formerly) of Polygon wouldn't cover it, but MatPat of Food Theory did
that title lol
Gotcha
Anyone else want a pokemon flavored Wild Crats spinoff?
This could be offensive to PETA in every way
Uh
Food theory: yes you should eat pokemon   Game theory: nurse joy is a pokemon   Film theory: yes you should eat nurse joy
How much of the specified pokemon have a good amount of edible meat though? Weight isn’t the only thing that should be taken into account.
I swear if I ever walk up to a carrot one day and get solar beamed I'm quitting life
These two videos are a better 25th Anniversary gift than what Nintendo/Gamefreak have given us.
The pokemon world dealt with the zoobatovirus early on and the people evolved to not be susceptible to it, because everyone is eating zubat soup since they are the most abundant source of pokemon meat.
Technically, this is a mix of food theory, game theory, AND film theory
Me: sees title Me: i can sleep to this
So I would eat nurse joy???
I think we found the timeline where im a vegetarian.
so no fish? becaus i guess that magikapr is the easy to breed, and other but the problem is that magikaprt is almost rock solid fish?
Muk looks good
Food Theory: Yes you SHOULD eat your Pokémon! Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a Pokémon! Nurse Joy: *runs*
sooo is nurse joy edible and technically a food? #CantBelieveItsNotCannibalism
Ok now give us ideas how to slay them
This could be a food theory, game theory and film theory.
There is also the possibility that Pokémon arent eaten regulary instead most meat is sintetic, being a futuristic world is fair to asume that that tecnology has been 100% mastered and real Pokémon meat its just eaten sometimes.
DoOtherPokémonEat Pokémon
Hold up MatPat. Owls are raptors, ie carnivores. So, Hoot-hoot needs to be replaced.
I wonder if type would be a factor to consider as well. For example mudsdale is a ground type so is it's weight contributed to the fact it's part ground? Or will it's meat have a dirty taste? If that was the case the meat wouldn't be very palatable and no one would want to buy it. Im not a fish eater myself but friends and family will avoid certain fish saying they have a dirty or muddy flavour. The things you make us think about.
I mean, vegetables aren't only for vegetarians. In order to have a balanced diet you can't just eat meat. Would have been cool to see other food groups as well. Still, cool to see that the obvious choices weren't always the answers.
When he said the word "pokemon" had me laughing idk why.
Kinda disappointed we didn't see the assorted fish Pokémon covered. Also Pokémon like Snorlax are obviously victims of big number visualization. A thousand pounds sounds like a huge amount, till you remember that's half a ton, and about 4-7 adult humans dependant on build.  It's a whale it should be big, well anything over 400 pounds seems 'big' to most people; so double that, make it visually rounded, and slap a word like whale on it. By contrast our best in ranch winner here is closer to the real weight of a horse, something I suspect has a lot to do with it coming from a more recent generation where more thought has gone into designs and descriptions than slap a few big numbers in there and go home.
But mine have a lot of gmos from IV training.
I think I’d be a vegetarian in the Pokémon universe “0-0”
Finally! I always said that the losers should be used efficiently.
The only thing I can argue is that Mubbury is probably mostly muscle weight and muscle makes for poor meat. While milktank or Tauros probably would get more fatty meat which very tasty.
pidgey clones! yep thats what they are
I will never eat my Pikachu even if u paid me a million dollars.
So can we eat Nurse Joy ?🤔🤔
Im not eating a fucking pokemon
W H A T?!
Isn’t Mudsdale’s weight mostly consist of the mud around its hooves, tail, and mane? It’s like an equivalent of a sheep with wool that gets severely matted due to lack of shearing, which causes its weight to build up past its usual average weight. If I wanted to eat a Mudsdale, I’d want to make sure I keep all of the mud off of it first, which would be pretty disappointing if it ended up loosing about 1/3 of its weight given how much the spots on its body look like clinging mud stuck to it.
What an intresting choice to be this channels 69th video
So I should eat Nurse Joy?
In the intro it should have been people call me the theoriest
if Kiddos and Gogoats were real, would vegans eat them?
I have an food theory idea 💡 what’s the most edible animal crossing villager?
7:35 That's not a Garchomp. That's a Gabite.
I wonder what Trubbish tastes like.
If food theory existed a few years back, would you have done the Ghostbusters theory (eating the stay puff marshmallow man) on food theory, or would you have kept it on film theory?
Hey that is not a gar-chomp
BDG: togepi!!
Horse meat is actually...not great. Some animals simply don't taste good
Really clever thing at the beginning: he put a picture saying "you are addicted" when talking about consuming YouTube content 🤣🤣
Why am I so intrigued about such a stupid topic lmao
Pretty sure Brock always knew Nurse Joy was edible 😉
ive been telling my friends to do for years thank you mat (:
make roblox therories
There was also a episode in the pokémon anime where Ash and his friends along with team rocket get stuck out in the ocean and they're wondering if they should eat the magikarp but it ends up turning into a Gyarados.
Japanes people seems to never really knows what numbers represents irl, when you look at mangas and animes...
Eh hoot hoots an odd choice sure it's big but you already said size isn't everything.  And one thing you didn't mention was ease of domestication and slautlghter. You dint want your big farm animals to fight back  Or cultural perception/better uses  Hoot hoot for example is specificaly considered a wise friend by many countries according to the dex and are often used as clock's.
Hrmmm… does seem to explain why in the anime for Sun and Moon Kiawe’s family Miltank  farm was in a bit of financial trouble. But then different regions too…
I think you have a problem mat you need to stop this
I hope That Vegan Teacher reacts to this video.
Matpat there is already a pokemon farm game. Its a wii game called "pokemon ranch"
y'all should start eating crickets and mealworms
Matpat, i've found a possible flaw in analysis of mudbray. A lot of that weight likely comes from the inedible sediment it lugs around. The extra weight it has to carry would also mean the meat is very muscular and tough so in actuality mudbray probably wouldn't yield that much meat, or taste that good. Probably tastes more like shoe leather basted in clay. Otherwise that's the only part I would disagree with.
Me: (sees mudbray)  Also me: "Get over here!"
“Eating Nurse Joy” I see MatPat is a man of culture
That milktank animation though…
matt patt: Dragonite tyranitar and garchomp Shows: Dragonite T-tar and gabite
can we get an episode about potntial pokemon dishes? I feel like thats what this episode neede... REALLY GOOD EPISODE BTW, made me hungry!!
✝️  Fellowship invite
What the actual heck did I just witness
Best Fish is missing
Now i have an excuse to eat vaporeon’s [REDACTED]
Did you use a gabite instead of garchomp 7:35
So I should eat nurse joy?
But like, a huge percentage of Mudbray and Mudsdale’s weight comes from the... mud. They are specifically said to carry around large amounts of mud on their legs to add weight to their kicks.
I only eat organic free range Ho-oh eggs
did this man just release a video of the nurse being a pokemon on the main channel and now you can eat pokemon here do i ask?
You know not to be that guy but applin is the worm not the apple just saying
anyone remember the last brian david gilbert unraveled video about Pokémon edibility
“Everything is edible, but there is no customer guarantee on survival.” -inky 2021
I can't say for sure, but I get the feeling that part of Mudsdale's weight comes from actual mud. It might be less efficient for a food source if you consider that.
Pat where did you get that footage 6:36
"Most of our diet could come lobster and crab and muscles and oysters" that because your American/Western but this is a Japanese orientated culture. I bet the pokemon world is much more into seafood. Tentacool Takoyaki anyone?
But beef isn’t an animal. D:
What about rare candy or evolve stones?
Very nice Gameboy style intro.👍
When Matpat says "Skidoo" instead of "Skiddo"  I can't help but imagine  the winter time vehicle.
Mat i think ur subjects are runny out of flavour (you know cuz food theory) but litterally eating your pokemon thats going a little too far
Problem is the availability. I was hoping to see each regions best food source.
06:34 I'm sorry but this is singlehandedly the worst thing I've ever seen
Ok so Slowpoke tails grow back only really illegal in joto region  Miltank would out produce a gogoat shield dex says they have to be milked daily and the milk is healthier  Also you for got fish basculin in particular were eaten A LOT and fish farming can get better feed to weight some time even one to one
3:14, regular civilian huh, what about that Nurse Joy over there? Sure she's normal?
I feel like you're missing a lot here by looking at traditional options. Munna is a fast grower, hatches in a mere 2570-ish steps, and looks like it tastes like pork. Further, it also produces Dream Mist, which seems like a useful and profitable byproduct.  Also, if we want eggs, we HAVE to be raising Chanseys. They're the only pokemon ever shown to be producing unfertilized eggs, let alone eggs suitable for human consumption. Fortunately, every Pokemon center has one.  ... ... Do you think Pokemon Centers sell eggs?
Spearow is not a Pidgey clone since you find it later on in the game.
When the omega mart video
This is a world were  Vegans who think there better then you can't be smug about it. Because that oddish is a  Sentient plant lol I think perhaps it's best not to think about it
I was surprised with the wall-e is the devil theory, but this ain’t it
Mats version of eating nurse joy vs brocks version. Iykyk
It honestly bothers me that some of the pokemon that are mentioned, then shown on screen, are actually incorrect. The 'Garchomp' shown is actually a Gabite, and mega Metagross was put in the lineup of legendary pokemon (though, yes, it is a heavy pokemon). This doesn't detract from the actual episode, but I think it was worth calling out as it might make the video as a whole seem unprofessional.
I wanna order a cooked, Onix typed Onix, and since there's a game theory explaining how nurse joy is a pokemon I'd like to order some Nurse Joys as well. don't question me
Ok I can understand the milk but for both the poultry and the red meat, shouldn't you be going off of something like size and volume (like how much meat they actually have of them) rather then purely based off of weight? Because pokemon don't exactly follow logic and I'm pretty the reason the donky weighs so much is its density, not because it has a large amount you can eat.   (Still enjoyed the video and I'm just try to ask why you would base it off of weight instead of the actual amount you can get from it)
7:35 you said the Pokemon's name was Garchomp yet you used a picture of Gabite
This is so fucking dark. I love it.
COUGH COUGH that is a gabite
This feels like a game theory more than a food theory
The answer is regular farm animals and vegetables like in the real world. They still exist in the pokemon world, if you read pokedex entries there are numerous references to them, and it's reasonable to assume they are still more common than pokemon, given that there are less than a thousand pokemon and twenty years ago barely 150 were known in the equivalent of the real Kanto region of japan
That vegan teacher entering the chat like                   .👁👄👁
plot twist:the reason why there is only one of every leagendry is because they were all eaten exapct the last ones.
I have had this theory of my own and I am not sure if anyone else has also had something like this kicking around but I have always thought that pokemon were all creatures developed to terraform planets. You would send a single rocket to a planet with a single archeus onboard who lands on the planet and makes all sorts of other creatures that all have the ability to modify the planet. If that rocket was traveling much faster than the one carrying the passengers then they would arrive after the planet had been terraformed. The people of the pokemon world study pokemon not to understand the creatures but to better understand the planet they landed on and to make sure it stays habitable forever. I always imagined that Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy were actually two of the original colonists that agreed to be cloned so they could more or less keep an eye on the whole thing.
i honestly think he is overlooking the edibility of bug pokemon
I love matpat collabing with himself on POKÉMON especially, since that’s how I played every generation as a kid. Why have friends if you can just have a link cable , two games and two gameboys?!
Got triggered when he said Garchomp and there's a picture of Gabite on display. 😑
I would prefer not to eat my Sylveon
What about magikarp? They may only be 22 pounds but you can find tons of them in practically every body of water in the game   Not to mention they have the fastest hatch rate
<3
4:33 My favourite animal is personally pork
Mat Dragonite  Tyranitar Gabite Me: HMMmm
A point being missed is what you feed your animals with. Since Hoothoot is an owl they eat meat. So you basically have to make all this math for their food also (which probably would be lab ratatas). Even if you give a Hoothoot only one Ratata each day, you would need to farm grains for 30 Ratatas to grow up just to feed one Hoothoot. Those grains could be food for 30 other birds that we could eat directly. Farming predators are extremely expansive, which is why we almost exclusively farm herbivores or omnivores in the real world. Or to take this the vegan route. Instead of farming the food of your food'd food, you could just farm a lot of food for humans directly.
I would eat a gradevoir if you know what i mean ;)
.w.
See
There comes a time in every foodtubers life when they must face the reality that pokemon would probably be delicious.
Rule 34 artists are already eating heir asses.
7:31 Matpat: And garchomp *shows picture of gabite*
Now Im wondering what on earth a Celebi tastes like.
Vegan teacher incoming...
Wait, if nurse Joy is a Pokemon...
7:35 "garchomp"  ...mat that's a gabite.
WHY SHOULD I EAT MY GRENINJA OR CHARIZARD BRO?
That intro title reminded me of Joshdub
Please not be eevee🙏
I got a ide y sud du a vid on Hart atak grill
Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a Pokemon! Food Theory: You Should Eat Your Pokemon!      Hmmm...
They literally mention eating pokemon in some of the episodes and also farfetched being overpoached because of how tasty it is.
I knew that by the end of the video you will say that we can also eat nurse joy since she is also a pokemon 🤣🤣
I have noticed that most of the meals prepared by trainers like Cilan, Clemont, and Kiawe tend to have meals that look heavily plant based.  I could be wrong in saying they have no meat in them. But I’ve never heard them openly mention any ingredients that weren’t plant based.
Slopoke tail
I literally eat a lb of crab a month
He said garchomp and showed gabite
Ok everyone what is your -team- meal of six pokemon? I want slowpoke, amoongus, combusken, milotic, tauros, and slurrpuff
I'm sorry what?
Yeah Mudsdale is likely a whole lot of muscle
They don't call Oddish the weed Pokemon for no reason
I'm sorry if this is annoying but applin isn't the apple but instead the worm
I have to disagree with you MatPat, the single most important question is “Which Pokémon is the *MOST* edible?”
the intro traumatized me and i will never be able to look at another Pokémon the again
Pikachu, I chews you!
An episode about burse joy being a pokemon, then a episode about eating pokemon... hmm...
That Vegan Teacher lookin real mad
In pokemon universe, even if you are vegetarian, you're not a vegetarian.
There are so many bots
Gotta love that random squirtin' Miltank though x]
Matpat:” dragonite, tiranitar, and garchomp. Shows: dragonite, tiranitar, and gabite
I'd eat Nurse Joy
Oh man that means I have to eat my rare mew
I'd eat nurse joy. yum yum!! 69
Experience points just increases battle power, not natural growth, Matpat. I suppose there's an argument for using that mechanic for evolution, but not beyond that.  Also, you're confusing vegetarian with vegan. Vegetarians don't necessarily care about killing a creature for food, as long as it's a plant.
6:35 "AYO HE SQUIRTIN"
I mean they actually eat them in the show so I doubt it would be wrong
7:36, ummmmmmmm thats a gabite, not a garchomp
Here's a solution: veganism.
bulbasaur bulbs  🤤
Ur eating a worm in an apple 0:22
That game boy logo was sweet
your actually forgetting one other source of food thats commonly eaten, fish
"In "My personal Pokemon farm simulator", Which is definitely gonna be a game coming from Nintendo one of these days"  My Pokemon Ranch: "Am I a joke to you?"
MatPat and Brian David Gilbert collab, anyone?
did'nt the 1st pokemon serise show that there made of metal in the titanic episode?
7:25 - about that - there is ANY source or... well theory on how it can be at least approximately translated to actual time? I mean like... how long is actually the incubation period for pokemon? (As far as I know - but I have watched only the first 3 generations till now, not finishing the last of them yet - Anime doesn't provide very much information besides... well Eevee incubation period surely exceeds like dozen days, and for Larvitar... I don't actually remember that...) Not just comparing one to another... Aslo using experience for an indicator of how much work is needed to grow a pokemon, what growth rate it has... is a really vague one...even seems... farfetched. Though I admit anime make it really seems somewhat reliable.  12:00 actually You should also consider their behavior. I mean more aggressive pokemon like spearrow wouldn't be this easy to farm as for example Pidgeys, so their faster growth rate may not make up for this.  13:45 I don't think vegetarians would consider plant-based pokemon in their diet :P
Today I learned that Pokemon weights are arbitrary nonsense.
Wait, we should eat Pokémon? *Looks at my Emboar and sighs* Sorry, old friend...
Lol I'm vegan
ash after watching this:my aggressive hunger still lives, pikachu, its time. DIG IN!!
What about the breed ability of these animals? That would also have an affect
I worry about Mudbray's ground-type nature.  While a Skiddo is Grass and a Hoothoot is Normal/Flying, Mudbray's ground typing could mean that it's partially made of ground, suggesting that not all of its 250 pound weight is edible.   I really want to roast a Hoothoot now though. I didn't realize how HUGE they were.  That's like four turkeys.
Food Theory idea: what if the world went vegan for a century Vid 23 of asking
I guess then onix must be an effective form of salt
Does that mean that we are playing with our food the whole time? Gardevoir is very tasty though, but I love squid girls.
Haven’t finished the video but I wonder why rabbit is so expensive/not as common. I’ve never had it (can’t imagine it but I know people who love it). Sure they’re not huge animals but they aren’t expensive to raise and they multiply like crazy. I used to have so many pet rabbits when I was little because of that. PLUS their poop is good fertilizer (and we had a huge kickass garden. Honestly I miss that) also their fur is useable. I mean I really don’t like the idea of rabbits being eaten but curious about this economically. If mat doesn’t answer this and anyone knows, what do you think?
Can’t wait for the film theory
Whale lord is basically a ballon
"the link is on screen!"  ....no, no it's not. There's nothing there but floating pokeballs
MatPat would do well as a Pokémon Creepypasta.
pokemeemans
I hate the way you pronounce everything.
Pokemon farmers refuse to raise miltanks after that one gruesome Rollout attack years ago. It's a dangerous profession
There was a noom ad and I legit thought it was gonna end with mattpat saying “ I lost twenty point on Pokémon.”
I wonder when Peta will comment on this video
P....Pokemon farming sim. How dare you put that thought in my head. Sold.
Don’t know if any one did and no hate, but why did the applin looks scared even though it isn’t an apple it’s a worm in the back then somehow becomes an apple (appltun and flapple
Hey Matt, at 7:34 you used Gabite instead of Garchomp, just thought I'd point that out
Vegetarians are still killing a life form when they eat.  A plant is ripped from it's home, butchered and eaten either raw or cooked.   It's not killing an animal, but it's still killing a life form.
I can hear PETA  screaming now
Alternate title: How to give children nightmares
I want a part 2 about fishing
6:35 Wtf
"-and Garchomp."  The pic of Gabite: *Flexing*
Mudbray problem is, probably taste like dirt. Also i think most of his weight include Mud.
some additional pokemon facts you may or may not have found during research:  Mudsdale is such a massive outliers weight-wise because it is among the few pokemon that are properly scaled in terms of height and weight to their real life counterparts, in this case being clydesdale horses. wailord, amusingly, is also in this group for one of its inspirations; it's not a scarily lightweight whale, it's a whale-shaped blimp that somehow lives underwater in spite of being way less dense than water.   hoothoot may not be the best choice for a bird pokemon as food, as it actually has 2 legs it swaps between when hopping. this, combined with the fact that its feathers are thick enough to make this hard to notice, means that most of its excess body weight relative to its counterparts likely consists of foot and feather, rather than enjoyable meat.   some pokemon have edible body parts that can be taken without harming the animal. applins make their homes inside of an apple, rather than actually being an apple. they have thin, green, wormlike bodies, so wanting to eat an apple with what amounts to a dragon type, hermit crab acting worm is debatable, but you can eat from an applin without hurting it. you would just be evicting it. the banana-like fruit that makes up a tropius' beard and the eggs held by chansey and blissey are all edible, and are freely given to those the pokemon like. they all grow back. eating a slowpoke tail is a fair bit less ethical, as it's still a body part of a living creature, but it does also grow back and doesn't do much lasting harm to the thing outside of stopping shellder from biting it there. and probably some psychological trauma.   after giving it some thought, its entirely possible that the team rocket branch in mahogany town was forcing magikarps to evolve early not to make powerful pokemon for their use, but as a way to make easily accessible meat for sale. a 5th of the standard step count to hatch, some radio waves to evolve it, and now you have 500 pounds of newborn, but very pissed off meat, which is a fair bit easier to... process... than if it had lived any meaningful length of time to learn how the world works and was still 500 pounds and very pissed off. they were also shown in the same game to be willing to resort to unethical food sales for profit, what with the slowpokes in azalea.
By that logic by eating pokemon lets you get leveled up
"I wanna know which Pokémon would be most likely to actually be eaten by a regular civilian."  I see what you did there including Nurse Joy in the frame.
nurze juy iz secret pokthemon?
It’s actually alright to eat appointments and Appleton (not sure about flapple) cause the apple isn’t them there the worm (for the dragon type is a pun on wyrem)
My main question about this is why fish were immediately discounted. While it may make up a comparatively small amount of western diets, Pokémon is a Japanese property, and fish make up around 40% of protein in the average Japanese diet. (I haven't compared all fish Pokemon, Feebas and Goldeen come to mind as contenders, but went with Magikarp as a default)   Considering that Magikarp have the fastest hatch rate and require little space and care (going off of real life fish farming processes and Magikarp jump of all games) I'd assume they make up a significant part of the market. Granted the average weight of 22lb/10kg isn't great, alongside the slow levelling rate... Although if we go off of that one Magikarp salesman who sells them for 500 Poké a pop, farmers would make an absolute killing by breeding them! *He's also known to be a massive conman but I don't know of any other referenced Magikarp prices.*  Goldeen could be a viable alternative, with a slower hatch time compensated by a faster levelling rate and average weight, but it depends if the people of Pokémon are that keen on goldfish meat.   After all that though, you could argue that Magikarp and other fish Pokémon would be part of the fishing market rather than farming, hence disqualifying them from this video. Depends on if you count farmed fish as part of farming or fishing I suppose!
Oh yeah, it's clear. That Vegan Teacher is joining Team Rocket.
“My Personal Pokémon Farming Simulator” did you mean: My Pokémon Ranch for the Wii?
Peta not going to like this one lol
protein comes from plants
Please do a Food Theory on how the food pyramid is a lie.
And what about a magicarp? It would provide a selection of fish while also being easy to catch. It could even be fried and even served like sushi.
If hoot-hoot is an owl… technically you can’t eat owls because they are scavengers which means their meat is full of bad bacteria and diseases not suitable for human consumption.
I disagree with hoothoot being the best meat option. Owls are normally carnivores meaning you would need another meat option to feed it.
Nothing like a pretty fresh video
Kinda makes sense We eat meat And meat is made from animals So yeah
Point to note, however:  There ARE non-Pokémon animal species that exist in the Pokémon world.  We’ve seen schools of fish in aquariums that aren’t Pokémon and Ash has even chowed down on some shrimp that were clearly not Clauncher/Clawitzer.  Still…this was a fun and very informative vid.
You know a weird thing I thought as a child was that if I were to eat a pokemon I would gain there abilities. Was I the only one who thought this?
Are you saying that each new region is introducing new food!! :O so the husian pokemon went extinct due to people eating them!
I guess wailord is mostly just air then
I'm not gona eat my pokémon!     ...i'm gonna "eat out" my pokémon
When mat was listing all the pidgey clones, i thought he was about to sing the poke rap.
This ain’t even all the birds in the franchise
U can in game hiv ergens rare candy end level Them that way Whit shocking blue candys in thear mouth
Let’s be real, Mudbray probably tastes awful.
With this in mind, how exactly are there pokémon that look like ice cream? You’d think they’d be extinct by now.
The correct way to pronounce miltank is Satan
7:30 That's not a Garchomp lol
What's next? Carry them around in small confined spaces like they're objects and make them participate in dog fighting?
vegan teacher gonna come at this video and try to sue or somthing
I notice that this I the 69 episode of food theory
7:35 thats gabite
7:30 Wait a minute, that's not a Garchomp
matpat: "nurse joy is a pokemon" also matpat: "you should eat pokemon"
"Pokemon farming simulator" already exists. It was on the Wii.
Game Theory: NURSE JOY IS A POKÉMON!!!!  Food Theory: YOU SHOULD EAT YOUR POKÉMON!!! Me: hmm…I should eat nurse joy?…hmm maybe Brock was onto something
He showed a computer image of vegetation
⚠Warning⚠ there are weird/dirty spam bots that are raiding the comment section whitch is really disgusting if there are any minors watching these videos who want comment on a comment. Please, let Matpat see this.
You eat the worm???? dude just let it Find a new Apple to sit in, you monster
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiìiiiii
I’ve literally been saying for years they eat Pokémon and no one believed me
Warlord is very light because it can Fly! Otherwise It would be too heavy!
Pokémon Film Theory: Ash is a father, and his stories is actually his wife telling their daughter stories about where they move to make it more exciting. You know, the mother and daughter in nearly every film? And who watched his Championship match on TV (possibly a recording)?
sooooooooooooo , no comment on anime DODUO FARM vs TAURUS FARM race ?
Farfetched sounds like the dodo bird
So... does this also mean that Pokemon eats Pokemon. So..."Gotta Catch Them All, Gotta Eat Them All". O_O
Ok, ok, but what about edible bugs? Like, we don't eat bugs much now for 2 reasons: 1 ick factor; 2 tricky to prepare because tiny. But bugs are super nutritious and extremely efficient as a food source, and bug pokemon are HUGE. Like, I can see genuine caterpie steaks! No bones, just cook and eat!
You have to include the none edible parts when talking about Pokemon with different typing. Pretty sure the mud horse was mostly mud l.
So...  Mat Pat just suggested that we could eat Nurse Joy. I think some of us want to eat her before his theory about Pokémon being food.  Yeah, I'll see myself out.
To be honest I don’t think this video belonged on this channel, but good vid overall
"Nurse Joy is secretly a Pokemon" is a theory that was already floating around the Internet for at least 20 years.
Even more advice why does that clam like one bite slowpoke's tail it must be highly nutritious
matpat pokemon prefessor scares me
Why do I have the urge to play Pokemon after watching this episode... ROFL!?!
Soo. Nurse joy can be eaten too ¬,¬
No You Shouldn’t, That’s Cruel.
What about Exeggcute? They're essentially just eggs and they're a lot more versatile when used in cooking.
I’m disappointed that matpat didn’t use Pokémon 2000 movie as an example since you can see a dead Magikarp on the table ash and his friends sit at.
Anyone else Notice at @7:35 he Put a Gabite instead of Garachomp?
...out 😏
So you're saying I should eat out Gardevoir? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Not what I expected on this channel, and yet at the same time, it's probably what I should have
What
Slowpoke and grow back its tail and then there's that new real octopus pokémon if you grow back it's limbs strategy is for ones that grow back limbs duh then it's infinite
small issue with the hoothoot idea... hoot hoot is a carnivore like owls not an omnivore like chickens so well they will be better in time management but not in financial OR meat quality
Since I am a vegetarian I will just eat the dairy lol
now i know that pokemon has weight for a joke
MatPat missed one thing though, how much of the weight of the pokemons comes from meat, and how much comes from bones/inedible parts?
Combining these two videos: eat your nurses!
T maketh sense yond in the ordinary of pokemon they would consume pokemon.  In the ordinary of pokemon what art steps?
And you ignore all of the fish and water types? Or even the bug types? You said in your thesis that this was for efficiency and cost effectiveness. Caterpie is medium fast hatch, and is 6lbs/3Kg of insect meat that you can use immediately at hatching. Silkworms by comparison are 0.08ounces/2.5g...
The really great thing about animal feed is you can feed them stuff we cant eat. Like tough grasses and such.
It's made very clear in the Pokedex that the apple is not actually part of Applin.  "It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it's just an apple and nothing more." - Sword  "As soon as it's born, it burrows into an apple. Not only does the apple serve as its food source, but the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution." - Shield  Appletun however.  "Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the skin on its back is especially yummy. Children used to have it as a snack." - Shield
I think eating predators (hoot-hoot) probably has increasing risk of parasites. not to mention predators are not great animals for farming because now you must farm other prey animals... er pokemon
I'm becoming a poke-vegan
Now this has me thinking about Magikarps. Like maybe they are so hard to find because people eat them or they are like a rare delicacy. Maybe they where hunted to almost extinction and that’s why they are hard to find in games and why the shiny ones are extremely hard to find.
More evidence that they eat Pokémon: Garbodors Gigantimax form has a DEAD Magikarp in it, with its head remaining and a skeleton body!
0:33 wait a minute WHAT   And I also now realized that in the "Theory O's" cereal it's just one big chunk of game theory.
Says legendaries and shows metagross
MatPat ate the apple vermin... That... Is quite disgusting ngl But after it evolves it's ok tho, at least when it becomes a pie, I don't think I would eat part of the fly/wyvern thing.
Duento density, wailords arr baloons
Well hot diggity dang, that gameboy esque logo intro sure does kick the nostalgia feels a bit innit
Well what about ditto? Could it turn into other pokemon and then be eaten?
hey Mat pat you do know that applin is actually the dragon inside of the apple right? you can just eat the apple part
Um actually... At 7:40 you showed the middle evolution in the garchomp line gabite, and referred to it as garchomp.
7:34 i'm sure everyone who loves pokemon has said it but i'll add to it... that is not Garchomp, that's Gabite
does applin taste like apple, or like dragon?
What about bug types? Many fit in the Fast and Erratic leveling groups and many evolve really fast, and they're common.  A thousand Caterpies might be more economic and nutritious than one [the donkey].  And they're an alternative to meat.
Do they... eat sentient ones?
So if your nurse joy theory is right I could and should eat nurse joy 😏
Y'all should try eating zubats I mean what's the worst that could happen
Did I just hear him call Murkrow, Macro?
One minute in I'll stop you right there they even talk about eating magikarp and prof.oak cooks a crabby on screen of course they don't try to hide it
7:35 "Garchomp" OOF!!!
wat
11:11 Ah yes, Muckrow My favorite Pokemon
matpat: mention wailord's weirdly low weight, doesn't mention that it'd literally be less dense than air.
Not the Applin no!
Work on the indoctrination theory part 2
Vegans close ur eyes
7:31 why the heck is there a Gabite but not a Garchomp?
Wtf why
0:00 GENERAL KENOBI
Finally, the question we all need the answer to.
That- that’s illegal or something ban that- 😟
“ALL YOU FEED ME ARE POFFINS. I NEED NOURISHMENT, MAYBE SOME TOUROS MEAT OR SOMETHING.”
At least Tropius is safe. Infinite banana beard.
Could really go for some fried blaziken
so.... wich pokemon is the most edible?
I doubt Mudbray would taste very good since it's a ground type it would have very tough and tasteless meat
Lol, this is so dumb. Funny
Without watchng the video, my estimate of which pokemon would be the more usual to be eaten if Pidgy, I love them but those buggers are EVERYWHERE you walk to, every step of the freaking way. there is no way people are leting them go if they are so available and easy to catch that is almost the first catchable pokemon a trainer has.
Don't forget the episode in the gen 1 anime where Ash is seen eating a deep fried Makicarp.
Where the feesh?
Pokémon gives you powers if you eat them
Thats a Gibite 7:37
The Pokémon farm simulador exists, on the wii
What about Magikarp? It's easy to hatch, pretty big and heavy, and you can find it everywhere in the Pokémon world, unlike Mudbray or Skiddo.
Mudsdale is actually a normal weight for a real world Clydesdale horse which can get to over 2000 pounds
C-can you not
I was today years old when I realized lamb is baby sheep and people eat the babies 😭
I am sticking with oat milk.
@foodtheory I love this theory but my problem is that:   1. Hoothoot is a night time pokemon    2. That would mean Pokémon ranchers/breeders have to work around the clock to take care of the Pokémon that are up in the morning and the hoothoot at night.  Other then that really good theory A+
Now the "turkey legs" at the Renaissance Fair make more sense... That's just a Hoothoot
That vegan teacher about to react to this
Brock-A nurse joy is a delicacy (If you don't understand then watch the game theory pokemon video
I wonder what Zapdos tastes like
Being vegan and watching this whole thing is a weird experience.
_"You know, I've always wanted to eat a Pokemon... What? They look delicious!"_ _- Boomstick, Death Battle, 2012_
Make a theory What does dragon taste like
7:34 that's not a garchomp Mat Pat or more accurately, whoever edited that
thats a gabite not a garchomp 7:35
crab and lobster is so so so darn expensive tho
ANYONE ELSE get an ad for going vegan before this?
I’d be vegetarian, If I lived in the Pokémon world.
It makes you think and now I want to unthink what I thought. Garbadour I'll just leave that there
Food Theory: you should eat your pokemon Me: well yes, but but actaully no
oddish evolves into a smelly Pokemon that produces sweet nectar
Yum?
I think he shoulda taken height or size into a factor. Not all Pokemon are entirely made of flesh. There are parts of pokemon that are made of metal or stone. For example, crustle is a crab, and although its relatively heavy, it has a rock she'll which contributes to itm
Dear Matpat,  So you know that Mudsdale and Mudbray BECAUSE They are heavy (because of Weights) For an Exemple do you See Mudsdales‘ legs. They habe Stones attached to them.
wow just wow
A quick addition is that basculin’s dex entries said it tastes delicious, so imagine what a 10 foot long basculeigion tastes like
Professor Oak straight up admitted to Ash that he would eat his own grandson's Crabby. Gary's Crabby would make a hardy meal? Gary, you better watch your grandpa. He might get some ideas.
what about then sea food, we know the fastest fish to hatch is magicarp but is it the best choice for a fishfarm
Someone call Brian David Gilbert.
How could you, Mat Pat. Well I guess now we know that he eats Pokémon.
DON'T LET THAT VEGAN TEACHER SEE THIS!
Well…… I guess that makes sense.
Oak would eat his Grandsons Krabby because Gary catches Pokemon?!  I mean I'm not entirely surprised, but I'm shocked they even let it be said in the anime.
If matpat was a pokemon professor I would play that game Also I will definitely eat magikarp and milktank  Anyone want tacos ?
I don’t think Pokédex entires where made for kids
Super size the industry with Rare candy
I like me some Swinub bacon And since it's a fire type, the bacon bakes itself
Theory suggestion: what’s the best way to learn on YouTube
THIS HAS BEEN BUGGING ME FOR YEARS! THANK YOU!!!
Pikachu would be Chinese food!
Somewhere far away Brian David Gilbert is screaming into a pillow.
Vegan teacher is going to have your head
are you doing thankmas?
Yup, Gabite is definatly garchomp
I'd like to suggest that perhaps mudbray and it's evolved form get a majority of their weight from it's nonedible aspects such as skeleton and hide since being a ground type it only makes sense that the skin would have to be incredibly thick and durable (ie. Heavy) to be capable of the high defense stats and thus the bones too would have to be extremely heavy to support everything. Of course the muscles would also need to be considerable as well but I can't help but wonder if there is a greater meat-yield ratio from another pokesource of an overall lower weight
The plant pokemon could probably grow back what you take off; for example with the appletun pokedex entry it was specifically the strips on it’s back they ate. So if you wanted to, you could start a farm of plant pokemon that stay alive but you just harvest the overgrown parts to eat. This way you are helping them out and getting something in return.
It shows my age when I knew full and well that people were eating Pokemon and already knew about that first Farfetch'd detail.  EDIT: Also, I would absolutely be a Vegetarian if Pokemon were real.
6:30 😲 I’m thinking it’s looks like that um
I can't wait to eat Nurse Joy if you know what I mean ; )
Wtf
The GAOD theory
6:33  Literally every guy after seeing Nessa for the first time.
game theory ideah how does link insta ttravel?
Did any one else notice the extra use in why do we use use specific animals for food
I live in a coastal city, well, close enough to the gulf coast, that I forget the rest of the country don't really eat much seafood....
But is  Hoot Hoot would be hard to raise and slaughter. One of the reasons we eat chickens is because they do not fly.
Do Pokémon eat Pokémon and which one is the most eaten
Who
Professor Oak: No, Ash. Your Krabby is much too small to eat.  Ash's Krabby: **frickin huge**
Are plant pokemon animals?
Hey gotta get that protein somehow
Food theory’s 69th video! Finally!
Hey mat pat do Pokémon eat other Pokémon and how is the most eaten
"We could all end up eating nurse Joy"  Matt you...you might want to reconsider your choice of words when writing your script.
I am a little disappointed he didn't look into Spoink Ribs. Such a small body might mean tender Ribs 😈
I can imagine a farmer with a frickin         Rpg trying to take down a wailord
some people call me food theories so funny 🤭😄
Don’t they eat combusken-
Mudbray and Mudsdale might be heavier because they're just big-boned. Like they're ground type and they have more calcium or just dirt in their bones and they aren't very meaty so that's why Milktank and Tauros are farmed instead.
For the beginning um applin is actually a wyrm in a apple not a apple, a wyrm is a long dragon thing 🐉
If Mudbray is so heavy its near has to be pretty dense
has Mat seen the anime Food Wars?
YOU CANT MAKE ME EAT MY CORVIKNIGHT OR MY SCORBUNNY!!!
I like the theory, but I think we're just scratching the surface here, and that might not lead us to very accurate results. We're ignoring pokemon egg production (and size), what the taste of some of the products might be (I'd think mudbray, though capable of providing a large amount of food would be really tough and gamey, considering that they're more valuable as packing mules) and what other things they might be able to provide (say the fact that farms would probably be very much inclined to raise wooloo and mareep already, so if they're already there, at some point they're gonna die and might be eaten)
Let’s gooooo! I was right!!!
Surely they wouldn't have to level their pokemon up? The anime pretty explicitly implies that pokemon age seperately from leveling up
wait, so it's ok to eat nurse joy? your two theorys combined becomes weird. or perhaps just more weird/morbid.
Fun fact this is the 69th (nice) episode of Food Theory
you  w h a t
Bro I’ve bene wondering what my shiny vaporeon would taste like
imagne going to pokemon center and just eating the nurse
I'm on a razz berry diet. The golden razz berries are my favorite
Funny thing is in some episodes ash, Brock and misty are really eating a roasted magikarp😆
"Timmy eat your oddish, it's good for you!" "NO! I hate oddish!" "*sigh* Well... if you don't eat your oddish then there will be no vinillux for you." "Ugh, FINE." *screams of suffering continues*
All the vegans out here sobbing rn
Tangela is vegan spaghetti. Now pass the Feebas.
How can I take this serious when you don't even know who Garchomp is?
we dont eat orstiches you sure about that i mean my uncle did go to south africa for vaction and he had alot of ostrich burgers there but i get you in marica and eu and stuff indeed we dont eat them
Now I need to know if torterra tastes like rocks,soil,trees, and meat
What if those other Pokémon taste better though.
I like the first bits
Would eating parts of a grass type be vegatian?
I love that everyone caught that he put gabite up rather than garchomp, but nobody caught the error a mere 5 seconds before when he said that 1/5 of 5120 is 1280.
7:33 Garchomp really? lololol
Huh
That thumbnail is definitely cursed
I saw a fan animation on "eating nurse Joy" a few years ago. It was certainly an eye opener.
My childhood!
Don't forget you can also eat the eggs by themselves ;)
As for curry ingredients in Galar they seem to use Pokémon parts that regenerate like Slowpoke tails and Kingler claws. Maybe they don't usually hunt or butcher whole Pokémon anymore
5:59 everybody gangsta until the pigs start to levitate
Seeing "For his final Unraveled" kills me every time
whoa whoa easy there Matt, of course I would eat A pokemon, but I wouldn't even joke about eating MY pokemon.... They're so ripped they're gona be hard to chew
So what you are saying… is we should eat Nurse Joy?
Haha me and my hubby just had this discussion, so people have less um problems to eat waterbased äh animals like there are more than 50 seafood items available in a grocery store but seldom more than 4 kinds of meat. I come from a farm in germany/bavaria/franconia where it has bee usual during postwar to est roofrabbit, beeing cat. We don’t do that any more but usual meats are rabbit(wild and domestic), goose, cow, duck, chicken, turkey(pute), pig(wild and domestic); Deer aka vanison(is it?) sheep and lambs i belive i never had goat before. That is more meats available than aquatic. We got carps especially the „aischgründer spiegelkarpfen“ which are according to peta the only fishfarmed fish humanly grown and farmed, catfish, eal, trying to remember english names anyways im writing the german ones, zander, hecht and forelle. Yes i played zelda i should know them haha.
And what about seafood?!
also i am eating a medium rare arcues
'Reads the title' Even if I should, I wont
I bet Mandjtv was happy when he heard miltank would probably be eaten in the pokemon universe
What about fish?
*Sees title  "Good soldiers follow orders"
I would eat the leafs of a lillagent or the prescription
I have Professor Lando telling me it's morally acceptable to have *ahem* intercourse with Pokemon, and now I have Matpat telling me to eat them. What a lovely rollercoaster this week has been.
Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon! Me with my Mega Rayquaza: Forbidden Noodle
1 hour
Um, part of farming cost is feeding the livestock, and hoothoot is an owl. It would be way too expensive to produce hoothoot meat because it is a carnivore.   Also, mudbray and mudsdale are partially made of sedimentary rock, so not quite the best meal.
What about the piscaterian people
That was not a garchomp it was it 2 evo
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE GOOD TO EAT I'M NOT EATING PIKACHU I DON'T CARE WHAT THE THUMBNAIL SAYS THAT GUY IN THE THUMBNAIL IS 500'000% PSYCHO
me and professor lando agree in our scientific studies, which are far more scientific than matt's, agree that pokemon are valid life partners as much as humans are. if it is ethical to make love to them, it is not ethical to eat them, as it would be akin to cannibalism.
7:33  That's Gabite, not Garchamp (not complaining, just correcting you)
"did you know that in terms of"
A fitting episode to post on Canadian Thanksgiving
Yummy pokemon
oh no! my childhood its broken
7:34 that's a Gabite
Has no one else picked up he showed Gabite not garchomp.
When Matpat says "Skidoo" instead of "Skiddo"  I can't help but imagine the winter time vehicle.
Hold on hold on hold on! Did he just call Pidove "Pie Dove"? It's "Pea Dove", like Pidgeon Dove
Wait, matpat I thought you said poultry was a 1 to 4.5 feed to call ratio not 13%?
Magicarp for fish? You left out fish, in a game that comes from a country that eats a lot of fish.
Applin isn't an apple it is the worm inside the apple so it would be edible
*flashback to when bulbasaur was brutally murdered and turned into food*
Magicarp for fish? You left out fish, in a game that comes from a country that eats a lot of fish.
Thought you'd have done one on all the berry and cooking mechanics through the years
Whelp, this video had me discover that I can't find Silver August's channel anywhere.
7:31 * Says Garchomp * * Shows Gabite *
why did you show gabite when you said garchomp
Yes, but cows eat thing we can't, like corn stalk they make calories from something we can't eat.
Me: MatPat can’t mess up a Pokémon by displaying the wrong image  7:34 Me: 😶                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It’s the “Garchomp”
So, how do we cook them?
I just was talking about this with my professor
becuase people are allergic to sea food
Aplins are dragons
vore
who else cringed when gabite appeared when he said garchomp
Seeing the other title from the game theory video,I agree with this title
Can't wait for "You should eat childrens souls , William Afton was right!" Lol that would be a fun theory .
I knew this day would come as soon as I saw G-Max Garbodor
This seems disgusting
I wanna be the very worst. Like everyone ever was *DUN DUN DA DUN* to eat them is my real test to chomp them is my cause~. I will travel across the land searching far and wide. Teach pokemon to understand, I have to eat them~
“We could all end up eating Nurse Joy”  Yes, but those types of videos aren’t on YouTube.
7:35 "Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Gar-abite."
Boom
You should make this a game theory
7:34 thats a gabite, not a garchomp
CHIPS AHOY THEORY PLEASE! THERE IS OFFICIAL LORE!~ ~"!S3O2I4D03OP.KTCIO45JTV54OTYH
PETA gonna be coming for you lol
*Eat ur Pokemon*
Hey, Ash? Where is Pikachu?  Ash: ...
7:38 umm....MatPat, that Gabite, not Garchomp
What about bug pokemon?
Matpat: *Talks about Garchomp* Editors: *Shows a picture of Gabite* Me: wait a second....
welp guess im having one of my best pokemon on my team as my next horse burger
1h
You forgot to mention that the industry actually gets cattle feed from leftover food made in factories so they get the munch on Cheetos and candy and other things too.
Pikachu would taste like battery acid
"Eat Nurse Joy"  yabe
So if people are Pokémon, that means they're cannibals? Since they're eating other Pokémon (ppl)
Yum
I chipped all of my teeth trying to eat my main pokemon. My aggron: Serves you right.
GOTTA EAT EM ALL
9:57 COFFEE
You forgot fish...
I wonder what dragon meat would taste like
oh god
How many children  in the Pokémon world go to school?...
I’d play Pokémon farm  Man the egg states in this video is egg xiting
Bro,I think almost all of the pokemon can be eaten cause they show it in the anime and games.
Thanks for letting me know mattpat I was getting hungry
MatPat: "Eat Nurse Joy" Brock: "Yeah sure"
3eeee
It would be epic if you dropped a Pokemon video on the film theory channel today also. Make it 3 for 3
Why man why man  hit you but thank
Thanks for talking about vegetarism too, I feel included 😂❤️
I guess you could call this a game theory…………get it?
Whailord is less dense than water, so Wailord Meat would be a exotic delicacy
3:52 minor grammer mistake. 0/10
What is wrong with you mat, are you that heartless?
So you tell me  what game theory is a she!?
You never mentioned the best FISH POKEMON TO COOK, @MatPat.
Does dense meat mean more nutritious…? Why would you raise a really dense horse if it’s not provided much volume. Would eating a wailord be like eating whale foam? How comparable is its weight to a blue whale?
7:35 That’s a Gabite Matpat, not a Garchomp.
The real question is if you know the lore of pokémon we evolved from pokémon so are we cannibals or no is this even morely right eating pokémon at this point
:>
Everytime i think about pokemon, i know for sure that if they existed in real life they'd be enslaved for free eletric/resource production
10:18, 😆
But even if it grows fast, doesn't mean it tastes good. If consumers don't like it, they won't eat it unless they have to. Predators don't usually taste good
Ok I didn't get watch the video yet but what the heck is that title I'll reply when I'm done
The audacity for MatPat to put this on food theory
That Krabby bit is hilarious to me, because in The Bahamas, crabby is another word for 😺
MatPat have you ever played Monstet Hunter? I think a good FOOD THEORY for it would be the amount of calories you eat before a hunt and if it makes sense to eat that much before a hunt. Even the special buffs that you get from eating.
I’m guessing geodude and voltorb fall into the inedible category. Just saying.
Game Theory: "Nurse Joy is a Pokemon"  Food Theory: "Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon" Brock: "Yeeeees, I would eat Nurse Joy 😎😎😎"
10:43, 😆
Just because Mudbray and Mudsdale weight more than a Wailord doesn't mean that they yield more meat in comparison since a Mudbray is on average about 3'03" (1.0 m), a Mudsdale is on average 8'02" (2.5 m), and a Wailord is on average 47'07" (14.5 m).
Vegan Teacher wants to know your location.
When Matt talked about rare pokemon "dragonite, tyranitar, and garchomp" the picture was gabite
That was Gabite not Garchomp
:)
Mudbray in Lahore goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
how on earth is tauros only 200 pounds...
I'd eat Nurse Joy... 😈
Intriguing good amusement and compelling research.
Tepig would be roast pig..
now when you say "eat" nurse joy......
Me when I when I clicked this video be like waaaaaaa !
Yeaaaaah PAT YOUR DEAD IM CALLING ASSASINS
i suppose that mudbray's meat is not just good in taste or for cooking... you know, it's like... mud meat. Who want to eat mud meat.
I WAS JUST WATCHING A GAME THEORY VIDEO ON HOW NURSE JOY WAS A POKÉMON!(sorry for caps-OMG bro I made this comment before he said that!)
Would Ditto taste like jello?
well weight doesnt equal mass, Mudbray is small but the weight comes from density not actual size. weight is to be considered like for wailord its probably mostly air inside soooo yeah this doesnt work so well. plus they types count for tadte and edibility
What about fish? Which water Pokemon makes the best sushi?
Love the gameboy intro, that gave me nostalgia
"We should well just eat Nurse Joy as she is a pokemon" Uhhhhh...........
*Says Garchomp* *Shows Gabite*  Anger intensifies
What a coincidence that matt patt makes a video about pokemon as soon as a start playing pokemon light platinum
Omg yes the beginning 😍 Also, what about those few times you see reg animals in the series. The new netflix movie has  pokemon that eats a very normal looking fish.
Where is the "Is Cereal a Soup?" episode?
As a vegetarian :) I would just eat those delicious fruits, veggies, curries, and food that ash eats throughout his adventure :).
Bugs have the highest caloric efficiency in the world.
You forgot to mention that mudbray eats mud. What would that mean for the meat?
Maybe I missed it, but why level up Pokemon? If you can hatch a fully evolved Miltank and it has "milk drink" or whatever its move is, then there's no need to level it up. You could start milking it right away. Sure it's a newborn, but it's its true form. Same thing with the other cows/bulls. Why level up a buffolant or Tauros, if it's its desired form?
I thought moomoo milk was canonically miltank milk. Almost every farm shown in the game has at least one miltank if not several. Plus moomoo milk is common as dirt anywhere you go sold at any vending machine you see. I would think it'd be a pretty common livestock.
So Taurus for beef , magicarp for fish what's chicken lol
69 ith video nice
Was that a gas chamber joke? 😳
69 videos nice
Not so sure about your red meat result. Seeing as you want to take in size as well a weight, Mudbray would be a very tough and dense meat to eat. Perhaps in the day of survival it would be more commonly consumed but, in a more modern day setting I think we would prefer a different meat. I think Bouffalant would make a better red meat. Also, I am not sure that game freak really know how to measure the weight of a pokemon. I mean Bouffalant is meant to be a buffalo that on average weighs 208.6 lbs. (Which isn't even a quarter of the weight of a real world buffalo.) and a Mudbray that is just over half that size weighs 242.5 lbs. either something is wrong with that or a good amount of it's weight is not from edible meat.
YES! More Pokémon!!!
Jesus loves you
The Early Anime Episodes Mention Non-Pokemon Animals. In The First Gen Games Animals Are Mentioned And Slowpoke Tails Are Eaten But They Do Grow Back
what about fish?
I want to mention that hoot hoot is about 2ft tall and would defiantly not last a week and would probably provide as much meat as a regular chicken would given a hoot hoot from what i looked up is about the size of a chicken as well Mudbray is only 3 ft tall not to much taller so the amount of meat you could get isn't a incredible amount more
With the appletin I’m pretty sure that they’re talking the nectar and not the Pokémon
Huh😦
I now want theory Os
i feel like you have to include regions considering the Pokémon world everything is separated by oceans so hence different Pokémon on different regions more avaibiliyy
I dont think mudsdale will give as much meat as you think. not all body part of an animal are edible, and considering its weight in comparison to his size i think mudsdale's body would most likely be inedible
The muds donkeys are probably so heavy because it's just muscle and bone. Mat, why are you ONLY taking weight into account?
Hi😯
I have I video idea what is the cost to eat healthy vs eating junk food say for a year ? What would be the cost ? Next Food Theory
Dang, i should eat my Eternatus?
Destroys childhood 😭
You forgot miltanks biggest advantage: It is always female. Every miltank will give you milk. The goats, while admirable for their easier growth, well, half of them will be utterly useless for milk production. Cause you know. Male.  And being that miltank will always birth more miltank, you do not even regire a specific pokémon to breed them.
9:55 wait hold on, did Ash actually check what pokemon koffing is?
Apllin isn't the apple it is inside in apple
That is a gabite not garchomp
7:35 im sorry to say this. But it's a Gabite and not a Garchomp...
This has been long a question that had me thinking whether or not people eat Pokemon. Primarily because you never see actual animals in the main games, at least anymore.
Mat Pat: You should eat your Pokémon  Me: I-
The Apple Pokémon it’s not an Apple is a Pokémon in the Apple
11:12 he really just pronounced Murkrow without the first r
The Pokédex, anime, and the manga all show/tell you people and Pokémon eat each other. In the manga and the tv short clip. You can see a Pokémon eating a human.   What should be a Theory is how many humans are killed per year in the Pokémon universe? Especially new young trainers going out to explore.
Can I eat lucky eggs
My question is... If certain pokemon are named after real world animals (ex: pikachu the electric MOUSE pokemon) Does that mean the pokemon world has real world animals? In the first season of the anime it shows some non-pokemon fish in Ep 7 but later throughout the seasons and regions theres only pokemon to be seen.
7:38 ….. u sure looks different
MAT you need to try ice cream for ur spicy food i tried it and it helps SO MUCH. The cold of the ice cream helps with instant relief and the dairy of it coats your tounge and the pain goes away trust me in ur next spice vid try it thats my FOOD THEORY
Now I feel like eating a bucket of Hoothoot wings :P
never mind did not know you put that in the video
i saw a short where it was cutting up bulbasaurs body and eating it
Now that you said this my Mightyena is looking delicious
I thought of this before and this just proves it more
I don't think hoothoot is a great choice, because it's an owl, a carnivore. I think it's counterproductive to raise an animal that eats meat, for their meat
12:47 2 of those Pokemon technically aren't Legendary pokemon.
Magikarp not useless anymore
ummmmm mat you know in a Pokémon games there is a item called slowpoke tail right?
Gotta eat them all!!!! Pokémon!
11:02 It's "Fletchling"; not "Fetchling". lol
12:45 mm yes, the legendary pokemon, mega metagross.
He says "Garchomp" then shows Gabite lol
This would make more sense if real life farms followed a “most efficient” policy. The beef industry is horribly inefficient, but I’d bet my hat that beef tastes better than some donkey.
Rancher mat pat at 3:27 would be a great pfp
uh, What?
7:33 we're all seeing that right?
what about fish pokemon ( keep in mid mr wahle is litterly just skin and air)
1 hour gang
I have a feeling fanfic writers will get a lot of mileage with this one.
Matpat- dragonnite, tyranitar, and garchomp -puts gabite
"Why do we use use specific animals" I caught that immediately, MatPat, you're fired
Me "Pikachu I choose you" Pikach "Pika pika" Me "For dinner"
pretty sure that happens in the pokemon adventures manga
i dont eat that
What's the best way to eat chips and salsa?
Bases growth on experience gain but ignores experience based evolution? sure that makes sense.
Hey MatPat and Team Theory, I've got a request/theory for you. I wonder do Supplements actually do what they claim? I am especially curious for the claims Dr. Gundry makes about gut health. Since protein shakes, vitamin supplements, etc. are all consumables its fair game for the channel. Are all these claims on the up and up. Sounds like a job for MatPat (really the research team lol). I love you guys! Best of luck, Faithful Theorist.
What about the parts that aren’t edible on mud braylike: the mane, skin, bones, and hooves?
I think you should have considered whether or not the Pokémon is a carnivore or a herbivore, since that changes the taste of the meat. We humans don't eat many owls because they simply don't taste great. However I don't know if Hoothoot is a carnivore. And therefore I don't know if that logic applies.
So happy you are discussing this.
I very much love and am grateful that you did this. please do another installment to this. Because going into this I was hoping you were going to do each of the most efficient pokemon approximates to all of our major food sources and food groups.   Please do one for plants because not everyone who eats fruits a vegetables eat them because theyre vegetarian. Many eat them because theyre nutritious and also make good ingredients in dishes and for side dishes.  And i would like to know what plant base pokemon are the best to farm and maybe staples in the diets in their world.   I personally eat a kosher diet and iam curious about kosher pokemon choices as well. because pokemon like hoot hoot, and Mudsdale likely wouldnt be considered kosher. Like i think hoot hoot would be considered a bird of prey, and kosher foods are usually herbivore based(with some exceptions).   And lastly iam sure region would be a factor in diet, because for example kanto region doesnt have skiddo or hoot hoots so could you give more specifics of the diets of each region based on the pokemon available there?   I know this maybe asking alot for a topic tht wasnt intended to be more than this but i enjoyed this and am interested in it further
i dont like the implications of a "nurse joy is a pokemon" theory and a "eat your pokemon" being uploaded simultaneously. are we going to eat nurse joy?
Matpat playin a dangerous game with the began teacher here
As an omnivore i would like to know which plant passed pokemon is the best
What about fire or eletric pokemon would eating pikachu and meat shock or burn you
OBJECTION! Hoothoot may be the bird with the most weight and meat, but consider the fact that it is also an owl; a meat eating raptor. With that in mind, we'd have to also raise some sort of live animal feed for the many, MANY hoothoots on the farm to eat, which would be far less cost effective than giving some other poultry a bag of grains or seeds.
Slowpoke tails are delicious
“Farms are a business...”  I'm reconsidering my opinion about Big city greens, thanks matpat. thank you. :(
why yes, we should be eating nurse joy.
Well now i want to know how efficient it would be to farm nurse joys
If allergies were kept in the Pokémon world then I wouldn't be able to eat Hoothoot's meat, because I'm allergic to poultry
I'm finding my main problem with the mudbray choice being not considering how much of it's weight is mud, density of bone (being a draft animal), and it probably being pure muscle instead of marbled. Also, I know 'turn inedible plants and rotten food in to meat' is a large part of why humans domesticated animals in the first place, but could a mudbray make meat worth eating, since it eats literal mud?
But does nurse joy give milk?
Deos real animals exist in the pokemon universe. Team rocket calls pikachu a rat in the first series
w h a t
Aplins do NOT grow on trees.  Aplins are worms living in a apple.
Pokémon sword and shield CONFIRMS THIS in the game you can make curry and there are bones in some so this video could be a lot shorter because you said this in the intro, also in the first series and some more those weren’t made by Pokémon them self, I believe in the X and Y series or the one before so in the first one when ash said “Please don’t eat my crabby” that could have just been them saying that that wasn’t true but even though they made it and not from the people who made the Pokémon games it is true
Wut
Will squid game be game theory or film theory🤔
I’m Vegetarian  Grass Type: Screaming
Wat
Something else about miltank’s milk is *YOUR BODY BECOMES A MILTANK* You still have your human head,but your body is a miltank’s, and I don’t think anyone wants to be a miltank-human thing
what did it sound like matpat did a poke rap 11:02
Wtf
That vegan teacher is gonna be very angry, XD
Isn't there a milk tank farm in one of the games? I can vaguely remember in HG/SS.
are we not gonna talk about rancher mat pat at 3:27
NOOOOOO not my baby HootHoot :(
WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU MATPAT!?!?!?! YOU MONSTER!!!
About 4 minutes in it kinda gets sad like wow i should just go eat my cats     But can't leave because I matpat is awesome
nice
You can eat magikarp in a restaurant in Kalos (X and Y)
Humans are pokemon in the pokemon world...
id eat anything from magikarp to mr mime, magikarp for them fish, tauros steak, mr mime red orb stew. eating a whole mime jr (you can just pop em in ur mouth btw)
"Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp"... shows a Gabite instead lol
Got to think of it, do pokemons eat other pokemons, since humans and pokemons are similar they probably eat other
*Regional Birds:* B.. But we already have a proper name?- *MatPat:* I said we PIDGEY CLONES TODAY.
Yep he has completely lost it
poo
7:35 “Dragonite, Tryanitar, and Garchomp” but it’s a picture of Gabite, irrelevant Ik just couldn’t help but to notice it
6:34 I don't think I needed to see that. 👀
You forgot about evolution stones. Farmers wouldn't need to battle when they can use a stone to force evolution.
Thats gibite not garchomp
*so I can I eat Nurse Joy ?* *If I was hurt would I get healed if I ate Nurse Joy ?*
Miltank
Matt??? Are you okay??
In South Africa we actually eat ostrich on the regular
Matt wants to eat Nurse Joy
Nurse Joy is the tastiest Pokemon ;)
pOkEmon
MatPat is the type of guy that would sort his pokemon in his inventory by order of flavour
Time to eat my gardevoir 😎
Come to think of it, I’ve never eaten food in a Pokémon game. Guess I have a buffet in the PC.
Mapat  you also need to know how easy to catch without pokeballs and if there poisounous to eat
game theory idea what is xp in the pokemon anime?
Another good reason to choose plants instead of plant-based Pokemon if you're a vegetarian? Most of those plants and berries don't know poison powder.   Also, that Game Boy Advance opener really took me back a ways.
While I understand your Birdmon section included common and easy to find birds, it feels like an oversight to not include Torchick and Combusken. They're starters, so that may play into their rareness. Sure. But they're chickens, man! Blaziken I won't mention. It's figure seems too lean to be able to get any decent meat from it. But Starters have increased in obtainability in the games as years have gone by, so they're not exactly as rare as they used to be. Not to mention promotional Torchics were handed out to new Trainers in Kalos when X and Y first launched.
I am recently hungry
Hey uh... hey mat pat? Apliin is a worm in a apple, so you just... ate a worm.
Okay but just because musdale is heavier than wailord does not mean he has more meat
Mudbray is definitely not what you're going to be farming for meat. Weight is deceptive here - you should have looked at muscle mass vs bone structure as well. Both Mudbray and Mudsdale are based off heavy, big-boned equines, as well as being Ground type, so they're going to be heavier in general. But a decent chunk of that isn't going to be from meat, but rather the thick, strong bones they're going to need to hold up all that weight. Sorry MatPat, I can't agree with your conclusion on that one.
I’m about to eat out lopunny    I’m just gonna exit myself out now..
What about eggs? I always thought Chansey woukd be the only pokemon able to provide eggs for eating (because of her attack Soft-Boiled). I honestly don’t think people in the Pokemon world eat actual pokemon eggs (the ones that would hatch)
Loved this video I'm hearing over to game theory after this, I'm just asking does Mat Pat have a a email. Would love to send him a email if posible.
don't do fitness theory do sports theory its got more stuff to theorize about
Hey Mat, take your little graph at 5:58 and apply it to your Wall-E theory. You can’t have a society run on cannibalism for this reason.
id eat a miltank
7:36 as a Pokemon fan  I feel Ishould tell you that one on the right is a gabite not a garchomp
They could use stones or rare candy to evolve Pokémons
9:58 ...What? But... Koffing IS the Poison Gas Pokémon. What's the problem here?
I'm starting to consider veganism now.
But wait in regards to milk from animals military k produces even without having had children,  and since it know milk drink that also might allow it to literally produce some milk immediately
Yet another reminder that Wailord is only about 1/100 the size of its real world equivalent which if the weight was closer to what it would be drastically skews the results of your findings. Weight is the most unrealistic value for Pokemon given than none of them weigh more than 2866 lbs/1330 kgs.
Mudsdale gang lets go
MatPat: “Most people’s diets have very little crab and shellfish” Me, a Marylander, living in a state where everything is crab flavored and there are huge signs saying nothing but CRAB: “huh?”
does umbreon taste like darkness
Here's what I'm wondering though, would hoot hoot actually be a good choice, like I feel like owl meat in the real world would be game with alot of grit seeing how they are strong predatory birds
130,641
I can't wait for the vegan teacher to see this video 😂🤣🤣🤣
I’ll be eating lopunny… if you know what i mean.
I need to know Matpat’s Pokémon team
what i still havent gotten over is how pokemon are like the "mouse pokemon" like, they are the only other creatures in pokemon other than humans, why are they named after real life animals if canononically they wouldn't know that stuff?
Pokemon for food-......?
Yeah I look at Pokemon and just think, "I want to eat you to see how you taste!"
“Now hear me out”
me: *looks at magikarp after watching the video* also me: sushi time
One is called "Nurse Joy is a Pokémon" the other "You should eat Pokémon"  Hmmmm...
Wot Matpat are...are you okay?
Cool character design at 4:59
this is kind of video that could also be in game theory and film theory, not just food theory
If cats eats rats meowth eats Rattata
Man  needs to collaborate with i chews you
Bruh MatPat showed a gabite instead of a garchomp.
0:25 WHAT the F*** !! he didn’t put Custer on it it would be much tastier.
So, the only question left now is, Who is the Gordan Ramsey of pokemon?
I watched this one second and already beaten you to the eating nurse joy thing on the other video. Wow
But DID you actually take into account the meat on Nurse Joy compared to the Mudbray??? I mean, if she is “LIKE” a Pokémon does she weigh more (or in equal to) in meat quantity as her “animal” counterparts?!!?   Riddle me that, Batman!!! 🦇
Hey mat I got a question for you, is it possible too survive in a mall?
timestamp 12:43 at this point I'm just making fun of matpat for not being a pokemon nerd after watching every single episode, he still doesn't know that it's pronounced mud-stale not mudsdale
That is a weird garchomp it kind of looks like gabite 7:30
I see a problem with HootHoot. It is an owl and owls are birds of prey. We actually eat few animals that eats meat, bear comes to mind and many fish eat other fish but I can't think of a single birds of prey that people eat. And that is even when you hunt them, the meat just taste bad. Then for farmer MatPat to have a HootHoot ranch you would have to feed those owls, and they likely eat mouse like Pokemons making them very ineffective compared to something you can feed seed. You would first need to breed or catch another Pokemon to feed it while it grows.  Chicken are eating things like seeds and grain, you want a bird Pokemon that eat those as well both for taste and economy. There is a reason there isn't a Kentucky fried Owl chain anywhere.
Omg game theory and food theory colab
Finally, instead of yeeting baby pokemon out of my box for room i can simply devour the entire box
I know this is kind of a nitpicky comment to make but I wanted to say that that isn't Garchomp. It's Gabite....
Uh that’s a gabite
Food
i still think Tepig, Pignite, and Emboar would be the tastiest.
Vegan teacher is going to have a field day with this one
You cant eat vaporeon but you can drink em
I will now proceed to go eat my umbreon
Hehehe search up pokedex 591        Amooguus
How do you account for the percentage of each pokemon that is actually edible? Most evolutions include an armor upgrade, so for example Mudbray might have a higher edible mass per kg than Mudsdale?
no you should bury like any loyal and normal friend would do 🤨
Pro tip: Eat during the episode so that you won't want to eat after
Yes
But why is mudsdale and mudbray so heavy? It’s not because of muscle and edible meat is it? I’ve always assumed they had some other types of minerals or element causing them to be so heavy.
0:21 B... But Applin is the worm, not the apple...
Where would I find somewhere to eat Tauroast?
So i can eat nurse joy?
I eat nurse joy
Ah yes eat your mime
what about a ditto?
Thumbs down for calling Murkrow, "Mukrow".
i wonder what nurse joy tastes like
Mapat you still have done a theory on that to beat a brain freeze, dude you did a theory on  how to beat spice 2 times, how to beat the buffet and NOW WE NEED THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM WITH ICE CREAM WE NEED A  ANSWER  EVERYONE HATES A BRAIN FREEZE WHEN ENJOYING A DELICIOUS ICE CREAM  So please answer the question
I wonder what That Vegan Teacher would think about this
125377th
And I accidentally put my waillord in my curry thaks
Did anyone else get massive childhood flashbacks from the intro? That's a Game Boy Advanced power-on screen if I've ever seen one
OwO im sub to u
NO       In a time where I just got back to playing Pokémon go, you did not just throw this video at me.
2 videos out today?   it feels like christmas even though its still october
Did you consider uploading the different channels on different weekdays? Don't get this wrong I love the videos it's just that 2 videos of Matt Patt in a row can be a bit much and than there's nothing for the whole week...
WELP WHO WANTS TO TRY MY NURSE JOY TACOS?
MatPat I think you overlooked the grocery stores in Alola
"We could end up eating Nurse Joy"  R34 artists: interesting
B'aw use use
Dear matpat i disagree
So that was the fate of Gary's crabby
I thought of this during the 1st series when I was 10.
Note: use Yampers to herd your skidoos
In the intro did matpat just eat a worm?
Anyone notice he didn't put up a Garchomp, but instead a Gabite?
Waillord is made of gas dude
Well, this was an unexpected thumbnail
Film theory we analize the origin of the detective pikachu. Game theory we dismantle most of pokemon dark secrets, now we eat it... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hmmmm so you should eat nurse Joy?
MatPat, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS 6:35
9:55 I don't get it
Why would you ever change the intro
I'm trying to remember in red blue yellow games did Bill accidentally fuse with his eevee?
I'm disappointed that he didn't address what sea food would be the most likely. Magikarp?
humans In the Pokémon universe like to eat slowpoke tails
Says Garchomp Shows  gabite
7:34 ah yes, my favorite type of garchomp, that being gabite
Would've been cool to cover bug pokémon aswell since IRL bugs are considered to be one of the most bioefficient protein sources.
Less then a third of a pound of crab and lobster and seafoods each year.......hmmm doesn't help that seafood is so ridiculously expensive in the U.S that few people are able to afford it... especially nowadays. Man i hate reality
Time to eat nurse joy
Comment for the algorithms!
WHAT ... NO WAY I AINT DOIN THAT NOT EVEN FOR ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
timestamp 7:36 bruh that isn't even a garchomp that's a gabite. I may just be a pokemon nerd but I am astonished by the fact that you got that wrong.
steaks dont grow on trees sure.... *in the Pokemon World...*
I rather eat geodude
Wait. Game Theory says Nurse Joy is a Pokemon and Food Theory says to eat Pokemon ... Stopping there.
7:35 That's a Gabite, my guy.  edit: Oh, boy... These pronunciations...
Wouldn't magikarp be great for farming? Cause it can survive in most places?
2 pokemon theories at once? Hm, coincidense? I think not!
Unfortunately, BDG beat you to the punch when he Unraveled Pokemon Edibility. Edit: I'm losing my mind, watching this videogame professional use a sprite for gabite when he says garchomp, pronounce skiddo "skidoo", and pronounce murkrow as "McCrow".
Em... Prof. Oak eats craby of his own grandson?  I love meat but i have some offend to eat meat from not mature farm animals. Not mature animals mean i.
7:38 it is a Gibite not a Garchomp
This is even more disturbing than normal, ty Matpat team
Even before watching this video, I’m gonna say that I’ve always wondered if people in the Pokémon universe ate pokémon. There are obviously no normal animals, insects, or even pets. It’s kind of a relief that someone else thinks this darkly about such cute... creatures.
Well, thanks to your nurse joy video on game theory, we can now eat a nurse joy steak and it's not cannibalism.
Thanks to ruin my day fnaf guy. You traumatized me Idiot.
Was there a large number of inconsistencies between what was said and what was displayed or was that just me?
Me: **Sees Tittle** WAIT WHA—
You should check Brian David Gilbert's analysis of which Pok[emon is the most edible
Not sure if you'll ever revisit this topic but there's a couple of things you haven't considered for this hypothetical question and the most important thing you hadn't considered was taste. An animal's diet can alter the flavor of its meat, so there really is a difference between grass fed and grain fed meat but the most important thing about this fact is that the meat of predatory terrestrial animals tends to taste horrible. Hoothoot, being an owl Pokemon, a predatory bird, would actually taste pretty bad and even if raised on an insect diet would probably be an inefficient livestock option compared to an omnivorous or herbivorous bird. Additionally, as mentioned plenty of times in the comments, leveling growth does not determine maturity, for example it's mentioned in some of Kangaskhan's Pokedex entries that it takes 3 years for its babies to become mature enough to start walking outside the mother's pouch. But for the sake of simplicity (which I'm sure is why the video uses level growth rates), let's continue using growth rates. You said evolving Pokemon would be inefficient but as it turns out, thanks to Sword and Shield and its Pokemon Camp feature, it turns out Pokemon are capable of leveling up by just being well cared for. I could imagine some farms put in that extra effort and cost to raise livestock that do evolve, the Pokemon world's equivalent of non-factory farming, so Gogoat and Mudsdale could believably be on the table. Granted, I bet a lot of Mudsdale's weight is actually from the hardened mud all over its hair and hooves.
The reason why wailord is only 880 pounds is because he’s mostly made of air
That’s nice, but you forgot to mention fish farming. Which is a real world thing. I could see magicarp being an incredibly common seafood dish. And I would probably still look to other Pokémon for other common farming practices. Like, would the Pokémon world use Pokémon or wheat when making bread? Sunflower flour is a thing that exists to make a bread and sunflora exists. And then there are Pokémon like combee, how would one farm them for sweeteners and is there a better option.
Do a theory on Yandere Simulator
3:55 why is there two “use”
Thats not garchomp thats gabite!
not surprised Hoot Hoot is shaped like a giant drumstick.
I don't know. Mudbray feels like it'd be mostly dirt and mud and not much meat.
Matpat, ruining childhoods since 09
“Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp-“ *Shows picture of Gabite*
There's one major problem with using hoothoot as a meat source: owls are carnivores. This means that you'd need to feed them more meat than you'd get out of them. I guess you could slaughter them as soon as they hatch, but then you'd need to be feeding their noctowl parents, and why not just eat the eggs instead?
1 hourxago
You know the funny thing is when learning about this information, I got a pokemon ad for the Pokémon movie💀
Encantk
I think the problem with selecting Mudbray based on weight is that it doesn't take into account how much of that weight is just dirt. It's a ground type that eats dirts, spits mud and covers itself with mud. Most of that weight could be from all the dirt in and on its body. I think you'll need to reevaluate that one, with a different type of Pokemon.
DONT EAT PIKACHU HE IS ELECTRIC I ATE HIM AND ALMOST DIED
Hearing Matt call Hoothoot an "absolute unit" put a smile on my British face.
I don't get why leveling is part of this calculation. Pokemon come out full size. They don't grow as they level up.    There's no mention of how all Pokemon make eggs too. Miltank would be a milk *AND* egg source.   Typing should be considered too. A grass goat would probably not be edible. Same with Mudsdale, it's ground type and part of it's massive weight is caked on mud (although I do think it'd develope nice muscle hauling it around.)
Mat: Wailord’s don’t even weigh 1,00lbs! Me:…..so is it mostly air…?
Title: "Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon!" Me: *big sip of my drink* what
Why do I fell matpat is trying to ruin our childhood
You don't know what you have awakened, MatPat....
dou you know thhat applin isnt a aplin isnt apple its worm in apple
nintendo is gonna sue u for saying pokemon
Watched both videos very interesting and entertaining
Since when Gabite was Garchomp lol
This is the greatest crossover of you tube mat pat from game food theory with mat pat from game theory sometimes I couldn’t even tell who is who this is awesome
The *best* Pokemon to eat is Mewtwo! Or mew.
I’ve kinda always assumed this was a thing ever since the St Anne episodes of the Indigo League and we saw Ash, Brock, Jessie James and Meowth fantasising about eating a Magikarp ... and I’ve honestly forgotten if Pikachu did 😅😅😅  Love ya MatPat and Friends 💙🐱💙
Theory : For nutrition, food producing Pokémon are fed boosting nutrients such as protein zinc and carbos which somehow increases their yield. Humans will also make use of these minerals in their diet as well
I wonder if Matpat checked out the Battle Buffet from Sun and Moon. They list actual dishes that you can eat in-game and considering it's a Buffet, wouldn't it be cheaper?
Oh I want me a piece of caviar and nurse Joy ;)
you keep forgetting to mention fish
is diglet made out of dirt
Funfact: The Applin is not an apple, it is a poisonous dragon worm inside an apple that uses the apple as a shell (Applin without an apple looks like this: https://i.redd.it/y1ijwqv5lmn61.jpg ). Good luck if you plan to eat it.
When you put the spotlight on Pidgey. His face made me laugh 😭
What the heck?! Why would you eat Pokémon?! No! No! Press X to No!
Mudbray is the most efficient Pokémon for food you say?   Well... I might have some counter points.   1; It's pure ground type, rather then ground/normal, meaning it likely has more earthen properties then properties of red meat, meaning it might taste vaguely like dirt when cooked (though I'm totally sure that this is among the least of the issues).  2; Mudbray and it's evolution Mudsdale seemingly are much more commonly seen as workbeasts, and to my knowledge have never been thought of as food.  3; In addition to 2, in the real world, horses and by extension donkeys', while edible, are more-often seen as taboo to eat, indifferent from a good portion of other animals, which is why people don't eat horse in most developed places.  4; There's also the fact that a lot of mudsdale's and mudbray's weight would make sense to be muscle, meaning on top of them likely tasting similar to soil covered meat, they would taste INCREDEBLY gamey.
Ok but what about density? Just because a Pokémon weighs a lot dosnt mean the mass is Rhett especially in mudsdales case its big but not that big more dense though, right?
Steer usually get slaughtered at 15-16 months of age, not 3-4 years
I got a Pokémon ad before this video
MatPat: It’s why we eat chickens and not ostriches. Meanwhile in South Africa:
8:37 That would be the case however the growth rate does not necessarily refer to the rate at which a Pokemon grows in age. A Pokemon's age and the Pokemon's level are not necessarily directly linked to one another. As time passes the Pokemon gets older and the more time they are battling the faster they level up. They both are dependent on time.   We know that level and age are not necessarily directly linked, because one refers to how much the time the Pokemon has lived while the other refers to how much of life they spent training. In the anime there is an actual old Pokemon, it is an old Treeko. If levels and age are directly linked then the Treeko should be a pretty dang high level to look as old as it seems, or maybe it just kept rejecting to evolve however the only time this has been known to be possible if a trainer cancels the evolution.   On the other hand even if the growth rate referred to the rate at which it grew it would still not fit with what we know of pokemon. Because even if we level up a Pokemon the weight and height does not change, this of course I am referring to the main line series games where the data of the Pokemon is always shown. The Pokemon Go and side line games I am not sure about though. But if we take what we know about the Mainline games and the anime, this theory utilizing the exp growth rate system does not hold ground for the speed at which a Pokemon grows.
Do pokemon eat other pokemon
Loved the video, but I have retained too much not to nitpick that a Gabite was shown but was called Garchomp. I know nothing can be done about it now (obviously) but wanted to clear any confusion if it was there.  I do like the execution of subverting the expectation of miltank not being the most economic milk source, something I definitely would not have guessed.
did you just call a murkrow a mucrow?
MatPat, I'm dissappointed in you! What about fish!? I mean, we literally have fisherman trainers catching Magikarp! How good of a food source is Magikarp!!
Ok
Wailord is supposed to be very very light, because it’s mostly empty and inflated. Giant balloon whale go brrrrrrrr
Most of us would eat joy, i guess
I don’t know if you did this for me but I had commented and sent you a tweet on doing a food theory, film theory, and game theory on Pokémon and you’ve done of food in game theory so if it gets worse for me thanks ( I’m on an alt account but I am Ayomide T)
Vegan teacher be like: 🖕
Machamp milk...
💛
I think this theory is ignoring the supernatural quality of pokemon based on their typing. Yes mudsdale is super heavy but that could be due to the fact it's GROUND type. Maybe it's bones are super dense. Maybe it's hide is dummy thicc?
It's not a colab if they're both your channel
NO, NO, NOOOOOOO WHY DOES POKEMON ENTER FOOD THEORYYYYYYYYYY
this brings me back to that one BDG episode
The quality of the intro gives me nightmares
If pokemon are capable of loving their trainers that proves they are conscious thinkers which means they are able to have intimate relationships with their said trainers. Me and lopunny baby
Cool vid, but i find it weird that Skiddo's the best milkmaker, consodering Moomoo milk is so accessible in pkmn, being found in almost all regions. And its kind of cheap too.
I remember once reading an article about pokemon, it explained that every generation they always try to make the Pokemon 50% based into animals and 50% based on abstract concept and things. I also remember that I read that for each accepted pokemon there are 10 who are rejected.  Ops, and before I forgot, there was once a plan to remake the entire pokemon game for american audiences, Nintendo of America believed that the series would never catch up in america due to being too cute. So they wanted, for example, to turn pikachu into a tiger with large breasts.
Title : “You should eat your Pokémon”  Me: Looks at my Garbodor. “No, I don’t think I will”
Wailord is actually lighter than air. Imagine ordering a Wailord steak and it just floats off your plate
Now you’re making me wonder if Blaziken tastes like fried chicken
"Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp" *shows gabyte* Physical pain
No, just no.
I'd eat nurse joy... Giggidy
Eating a ground-type pokémon doesn't sound very appetizing. I'll stick with normal and flying types.
7:30 "And the preevolved forms of Rare Pokémon like Dragonite, Tyranotar, and Garchomp"  Mat, that's a Gabite, not a Garchomp
This is so messed up!
Sorry, but the reason humans eat mostly a small amount of foods isn’t because of money, it is because in the early days of farming and agriculture humans were only able to domesticate and farm a small amount of animals and plants, so those are the things that we ate. For example, today to eat a lobster someone need to get in a boat, take special equipment and go. 10 thousand years ago there just wasn’t anyway for human to do that so they didn’t eat lobster.  So, obviously, in the Pokémon world people won’t eat charizard meat because early human would have no way of doing that, but that is true also for Pokémon who have specific need that early humans wouldn’t be able to provide(don’t know if there actually are Pokémons like that I don’t know a lot about Pokémon)
MatPAt : we don't actually have diversity in our food consumption! any animals in nature : I like that one thing. I'm gonna eat that for the rest of my life.
looks like torchick is going on the menu.  spicy nuggets all around
early
Does he not garchomp
I hope that veagan teacher watches hahaha
Yummy I’d eat a muk
Wow nurse joy secretly a Pokémon. MIND BLOWN!!!! I need that video NOW!!!
wait i just wached the nurse joy vid YOU CAN EAT NURSE JOY
I wasn't the only one here who realized the entire food theory intro is missing?
3:14 hey! You aren't suppose to be there joy
Hmm... For Gogoat, would it's meat and milk, would it still be considered vegan/soy?
The anime is really full of vegetarians though, I think that's just much more common int he Pokemon universe than it is in ours. I'm not saying that people don't eat Pokemon, just that the normal person doesn't seem to.
actually loads of people eat ostriches
Oof.... Yeah, farming IS a business, but not the kind you think...
7:34 That wasn't a Garchomp...
One gripe I have with the HootHoot analysis is that their ability to flying actually throws a wrench into things.  Sure you could clip their wings, but one of the reasons that Chickens are one of the preferred poultry meat sources comes from the fact that they can't fly very well (meaning you don't have to worry as much about them possibly escaping at some point.)
This title and idea takes it to the next level of insane
mudbray could be heavy due to heavy skeleton instead of meat?? and pretty sure most people dont appreciated meat with muddy taste.
That was a Gabite, not a Garchomp
Mmm can’t wait to have some tasty Pokémon!
The apple part of Applin isn't biologically part of Applin
next thing you know, the next pokemon game introduces some berry catagory that replaces the stat-boosting drugs and one of them is high in Protein
There is a video of a Pokémon version of Old McDonald on the Pokémonkidstv YouTube channel showing some Pokémon they have on farms in the Pokémon world.
......... Answer to thumbnail: NO!
MATPAT LOOK INTO THE LORE OF THE ITEM LABEL YOUTUBE CHANNEL/TOY LINE AND THEIR MAIN CHARACTER PEEPY IT'S SUPER CREEPY AND INTRIGUING IT'S UP TO IT'S NIPS IN THEORY JUICE
THATS A GABIT NOT A GARCHOP!!!!!!!!
so kanto fried chicken is real huh.
7:35 Garchomp but shows Gabite.  MatPat please ._.
Tropius just grows fruit.
🤔I wonder if legendary pokemons are edible… 👀
Eat bug type and live in pokeballs.
7:37 that's a Gabite not a Garchomp
Are these uploads implying we should eat nurse Joy?
Mistakes I found: 1:18 Appletun is spelled "Appetun" 7:36 Gabite was shown instead of Garchomp
we're ignoring how he pronounced murkrow as mukrow..?
So actually, with the caloric efficiency in mind, we should all be vegan for maximum efficiency, then we have 100%?
not mat pat using gabit while taking about garchomp
3:12 "My Personal Farming Simulator" For a split second I thought it was a real game that I had somehow missed. I've wanted a game like that since I started playing the Harvest Moon franchise ;_; Using Sandsthrews to plow the land, Bulbsaurs to sow seeds, Squirtles to water the plot... Even as an adult, I use Pokemon retextures for my Stardew Valley files! Plese Nintendo, give us a Farming/Ranching Pokemon game!
So why is there a gabite instead of a garchomp at 7:35? It's a minor error but it's there.
buy tickets for spiderman no way home when they go on sale
Who would eat cute creatures
i wanna know witch pokemon would get u high :Ddd
Love your videos keep it up
0:15 wth is the nidoran afraid of? It's a poison type, it sure ain't going down alone
7:34 Sir, that's a Gibite...
Applins aren't the apple they are the worm inside you dummy so they don't grow on trees
The question now is how much of that pokemon is actually meat And whether or not it would actually taste good?
Fetch-ling and Muk-row. Pokemon pronunciations arent usually much of an issue but wow thats just eliminating entire letters XD
friendly reminder that the latest gen pokemon make 0 sense Mudsdale only weighs so much because gamefreak basically went 'frick you.'
i'm lactose intolerant & just watching this video i can already feel my stomach grumbling
Pokémon are Friends not food.
YOU NEED TO DO ANOTHER OMAGAMART VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Food theory week 9, MATPAT DO A VIDEO ON HOW LONG YOU CAM SURVIVE ON DIET COKE
And that was the last time we saw any of the theme song intros...  Remember when the Theory Channels only had their theme songs and they were amazing? Now they just use custom splash screens and jump right into the show.
Id love to try a wailord steak, squirtle soup, gyarados sashimi, or tentacruel calamari! I love water type pokemon
Welp time to chew on my 3DS
Squid game film theory?
now peta mad
Honestly matpat your the besttttt

Sooo Kentucky Fried Hooters anyone? 😆
The less I have to think about what I'm eating in that world the better.
Whats the best pokemon to eat? is it mew?
7:34 pretty sure that's Gabite

And here I am, wanting to be food to my pokémon...  I mean, what? I said nothing.
Somehow reminds me of that manga where the adventuring party goes to dungeons to cook and eat the monsters... "Delicious in Dungeon". Maybe a future episode?
Imagine having a legendary pokemon known for being a one of a kind and someone just eats it casually
Wait- It’s not April Fools yet- 🤔😳
i will never eat my pokemon
God no please god no
That is a really good theory, but I think the pokemon company disagrees because of the pokemon ranch in sun and moon, they literally have fenced miltank and tauros. And a theory of mine that disagree on the mudsdale line being there is there usage in the games, they are really resistant, that's why they are used to ride over pointed rocks, also their stats and their ability "stamina", they have so much defences that probably makes their meat really hard and inefficient to eat, also the ones that have the "stamina" ability would just get more defensive with every hit taken, so I think they would be a lot like magikarp, looks edible, but in reality, it's not.
Wait how would you even cook a fire type since their bodies are built to survive temperatures way hotter than an oven
The pokemon nerd in me wants to point out that THAT is not garchomp but its middle form. Also Mukrow? XD
Hey guys, can you please let us know if organic food is actually better than GMOs. Thanks guys
MatPat: Pidove (Pie-Dove) Every Pokemon Fan: Pidove (Pigeon-Dove-Love)

Don’t eat me plz
Does anyone else think its funny that this is on food theory instead of the game theory
Newest matpat video nurse joy is a Pokémon, which means she can be eaten
7:33 Are we not going to talk about the fact that he just called Gabite a Garchomp?
I am very uncomfortable with this because I was just playing Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon and we just got to that one part we're spoilers they want to hunt you down so now I'm feeling worse now to watch Theory
you gotta tenderize the heck out of that Mudbray meat though
fish?
4:32 beef is the most profitable animal   Since when was beef a animal
Killing dogs or pigs for food is wrong if there are alternatives available.
Personally I don't want to eat my Charmander but thanks for the offer
I love this bc a month ago my friend and I were discussing what tipe of pokemon would be eaten
Lovely video, Matt! But I hate to say this theory is not really... Complete.  Of course that's the most efficient Pokémon to eat, ever, but those Pokémon are not in every region. Mudsbray meat would definitely have to be imported to Kanto, which wouldn't be a huge success in saving up money.  So I'm left wondering, which is each region's own variation of farm meat and dairy? Would it be more profitable to not raise farm animals at all and just concentrate on fish farms? Or perhaps the economy would grow to be more overall agricultural depending on the place? That would be very interesting to know
Looks like someone had their bowl of Theory-O's for breakfast this morning! 🤣
0:28 "MatPat, you just ate a worm."
Would fletchling be spicy?
A question is asked, "what would the tastiest pokemon be?". Do WE know, what is the tastiest animal/eatable flesh in OUR world?
7:34 that's a gabite
Mat bdg hesitated to do this for the longest time and now you’re telling be I SHOULD DO IT!!?!??!
Im going to go eat a 5 star Steelix with a side of durant
7:35 that’s a Gabite not a garchomp mat
I like how he made a video saying Nurse Joy is a Pokémon but called her a regular human at 3:10
Anyone remember Pokémon ranch on Wii?
What about XP candy
hey math ur videos are amazing and can u wish me an happy birthday? if u cant its ok dont feel forced :)
They should add an option to eat your pokemon in the games
Did he show a picture of gabite and call it garchomp?
I think your dairy calculations are off. Yes, Miltank grows more slowly than Skiddo. But it learns the move Milk Drink at level 11(in generation 5, since we'recomparing directly with Skiddo). Since that move can be used in-game to heal other pokemon in your party, it can be assumed that it's ready to be milked at or soon after that age. Skiddo never learns the move, perhaps implying that it, like goats IRL, take more labor to produce their milk. While a level 1 Skiddo is theoretically sexually mature, they're definitely nowhere near their milk-producing peak. I think it's more likely that milking starts when they evolve at level 35. The ranches we see in the anime have Gogoats, so I think we can assume that evolution is in play. Additionally, Skiddo are only about 31 kg, while Miltank are 75.5 kg, and Gogoat are  91 kg. Mass probably isn't a direct translation to milk production, but there's got to be a correlation. And since using Miltank's Milk Drink to heal other pokemon depletes Miltank's HP, I think HP can be said to correlate, too. Miltank's base HP stat is 95, Skiddo's is 66, and Gogoat's is 123.(You could also apply the Special Defense stat, since it tends to imply fatty bulk, good for making milk, but the distributionis similar, so there's little point.) So with the extra labor to get Skiddo and Gogoat milk, as well as the extra time and labor to raise them to evolution, there does seem to be a trade-off against Miltank's quicker maturity and easier milking (I don't know any animals in the real world who can walk up to a bucket and intentionally milk themselves, besides humans, but I imagine it'd be a serious saving in labor), the more wide-open pastures they seem to need may make for a similar trade-off to cows vs goats in the real world. And finally, all miltank are female. One male pokemon can impregnate as many miltank as we like, and will produce only other Miltank. But half the Skiddo born will be male, and thus unable to produce milk. In a region like Kalos, where quick and cheap transit is highly valued, those males aren't a total loss. But in less urban places like Johto, where distances are too great for a sprinter like Gogoat, half your stock will be a total loss.
Y
And me, a vegetarian
wow
Steel pokemon be lucky tho
Bro today I asked myself is everyone in the Pokémon universe all eat plants? EDIT: eat Mewto
WOW is here
violence
Applin are the worm in the apple, they don't grow on trees themselves
Did he call murkrow mukrow
🐖  noice
"just vibin*
But what about fish
7:34 nice garchomp lol
Sooo flavor definitely didn't become a factor here. I think we can all imagine that Mudbray probably tastes like mud.  Another interesting factoid: Skiddo doesn't eat if it has sunshine and water thanks to its photosynthesis capabilities. This means it probably isn't producing animal milk, but rather something closer to oat milk or soy milk. These plant milks have to be fortified to contain enough nutrients like vitamin D and potassium, and they don't have the complete protein you'd get from cow or goat milk.
Hi
Do I feel gassy after eating a whesing?
"You should eat your Pokemon!" Also MatPat: "Nurse Joy is a Pokemon!" *hmmmmmmm*
I hear Brian David Gilbert yelling at his screen about Pokémon edibility
Vegan teacher is typing, i can sense it.
Ah yes, another episode of Demonetized Theory
As a pescetarian, I'd be interested in knowing how efficient a marine-based diet would be as the standard in the Pokémon world, since Water Type Pokémon are easily the most abundant.
I just came from the nurse joy video nice job
speak for your self I eat Ostrich and Emu!
Great if fortnite and Pokémon ever do cross over and need a new food
im so sorry but Applin is the worm not the apple
no, we call you Mattypatty, Matpat, game theorist, film theorist and Matthew. But yeah Food theorist is included.
I've been saying for a long time if I were in the pokemon world I'd be completing my food dex by eating every pokemon I find. Glad I'm not the only one to think about this stuff
Obviously having a lot of weight of meat is good but isn’t the amount of meat more based on volume? Like yeah obviously if the meat is more dense it likely has more nutrients per bit but isn’t the amazing of meat more important than the weight?
What if I give coffing or whesing my inhaler?
So, you've been duped Matpat. The medium slow and medium fast are somewhat of a misnomer, as the medium fast group is actually slower in the early levels, they just take less XP to get to level 100, making them quicker in the late game.  But if you're looking at raising a pokemon to maturity, you're not looking to get to level 100. Exactly which one is better is going to depend on what level you peg maturity to be at, but it's almost certain that the medium-slow group has the actual advantage.
What about bug-types? Real world insects and arthropods are full of protein, and given the mind boggling sizes of even caterpillars, wouldn't bug protein be viable?
You should do a game theory on pokemon unite maybe how they devolve pokemon.
Mat: Uses dantdm twitch intro                                  Dantdm: hold up Wait a minute
Jigglypuff got them meaty meat 🤪
7:36 that is not a Garchomp, the picture that you showed was a Gabite...
I'd doubt Mudsdale/Mudbray would be that great tbh, they're workhorses, as pointed out, they're heavy, dense, unless you have literally no other choice, you'd want a tender, more chewable meat, I doubt any muscle in that unit is softer than a rock
at 7:33 matpat says garchomp and then shows an image of gabite
Mmmm hooty
i will now take a bite out of matpat for eating that applin
Hey matpat are the rock slimes from slime rancher invasive
“Where’s a chocolate Pokémon. I NEED TO EAT”
6:35 … dude that’s cursed, and I never want to c that agin
MattPatt: We could end up eating nurse Joy.  >eat up nurse Joy.  Questionable choice of words, but then again, everything is questionable in a world where you could eat your pet hoothoot's cousin.
PETA about to make a post about this in 3, 2, 1......
Mmm ...i look delicious
Is it Pokemon week? I think it's Pokemon week
OMG, MatPat. The amount of misinformation is infuriating. The reason meat is so cheap in the U.S. is because of our tax dollars being used to subsidize the industry because of Beef Checkoff. Billions of upon billions of taxpayer dollars every year go towards beef, dairy, and eggs to keep it cheap.   The correct answer to this video is no Pokemon should be eaten. If you're going to do a real world comparison then the reasons you shouldn't eat Pokemon are:  Terrible for the environment. Eating animal products will ALWAYS be WAY less efficient than just eating those calories yourself. Why feed 20 - 50 pounds of food A DAY to a miltank when you could have just fed that same food to humans directly? Don't tell me humans can't eat wheat, soy, and corn. The IPCC said if everyone stopped eating animal products then by 2050 we'd be able to grow MORE food on LESS land and free up space to restore forests and other habitats to wildlife AND lower carbon emissions.  Zoonotic diseases. We've been in a freaking pandemic for nearly 2 years now because of zoonotic diseases. If the Pokemon world was more realistic, there would be influenza outbreaks every year because of people eating pidgeys or whatever farmed animal they decided to eat. Influenza mostly comes from chickens and kills tens of thousands of people every year. SARS, influenza, leukemia, bird flu, swine flu, mad cow disease, and many others come from animals. No one ever got the lentil flu. We get those diseases from ANIMALS not plants.  Health. You don't need/want protein from animals. It's terrible for your health. If Pokemon was the real world then in 2019, the #1 and #2 killers worldwide would be heart attack and stroke, respectively. Those are diet-related diseases. In the Pokemon world, 15 million people would have died because they were eating a crap diet and it caught up to them.  And then of course there is ethics. Most people are hypocritical when it comes to their love of animals. We're taught dogs and cats are awesome but it's fine to torture and murder these other animals over here. Cows are smarter than dogs and pigs are as intelligent as a 3 year old human child. Imagine putting a 3 year old human child into a gas chamber. That’s what we do for bacon.  And you literally supported factory farming.   You're supposed to be a man of science. I understand getting past the idea you need to eat animals to get your protein or whatever is very difficult but it's utter crap. You're literally hurting your audience and don't even know it. I can't be subbed to this channel anymore. It's too stressful.
Me wondering why this video was made
Is dinomaking dangrous in Pokémon sword and shield
That is not garchomp it is it's pre evolution gabite.
Yeah, isn’t Hoothoot an Owl Pokémon? And owls are carnivores, right? Also, that Mudbray is a ground type Pokémon, right? Might as well be eating dirt because its muscles are laced with it & such… Try again?
Video Idea: Find the best food meal vitamin and variety wise. Basically the best "If you can eat only one meal, what meal would you choose?" food And also try to cook it irl
Wow
There were so many Pokémon names that were butchered in this episode.
Glad you didn't list the pflanttyps :D
Great video - my Food Theory Apron just shipped!  👍I can't wait; love your channels!  🥰
MATPAT WHY- this title caught me off guard so much I  was supposed to be doing homework
Yea the Phrase "eating Nurse joy" totally can't be taken another way. if you know what I mean
WHAT
At this point matpat will eat like a homeless man
"Is Nurse Joy a Pokemon"  I...I..uh..I don't know
Love content
What about fish?
I would love to eat a gyarados ngl
I didn't know Skiddo was a Pokèmon until today.. let's just say I've got a new favorite, sorry Wooloo and all the Eevee Evolutions
56 minutes early yay
7:34 that’s a Gabite, not a garchomp
As a farmer chicken take more than a month to reach adulthood
They put a picture of a gabite and not garchomp
Pokémon
In the hypothetical pokemon farm Sim there should be an option to buy a ditto from a shady business person that would double your pokemon breeding
Fun fact:applin it is a dragon not the apple,the aspect of the dragon   is  like a worm
I don’t think that Garchope 😂😂😂 7:34
As yes. Vegan Pokémon. The only time where being “vegan” is an act of prejudice against a specific group of animal, and not a way to protect them.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Finally we can get Pokemon:Survive its a eat or be eating world out here.
Fruit and vegetables exist in the Pokémon world because applin is actually a worm Pokémon inside of it so where else would it get the apple, but I guess everyone in Pokémon is a vegetarian
It’s Pikachu It’s okay 👌
Interesting
Very sus title
excuse me while I go eat a missingno.
I don't know how much of a Pokemon might actually be edible. Like some Pokemon have rock and steel covering them. Like how deep does it go
WWWWWHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So in other words, we should eat Nurse Joy
_Mat:_ People Call me The Food Theorist _Me:_ *I call you a physco! Why would you eat a Eevee! Or even a Onyx, somehow.*
FUN FACT: Applin is not the apple, but the worm inside the apple.  Also you said garchomp yet you used the image for gabite.
But how much of Mudsdale is actually... mud?
Pokemon Ranch
Many say insects are the future of meat, so it was disappointing that that wasn't a category
How do I eat my Mewtwo?
I feel like the thumbnail can turn into a creepy pasta
7:32 ah yes Dragonite, Tyranitar and Garchomp .. .. wait thats not Garchomp :D
When is the omega mart vidddd
lmao imagine pokemon acknowledge both theories and have a sign in a pokemon game that says "please do not attempt consumption of poke-hospital staff."
Other then dirt poor countries who and why would you eat horse ? I'd love to see someone in America start selling horse meat , let's see how that plays out
Eat your pokemon *r34 intensifies*
Anyone else get a rush of nostalgia from that Gameboy Advanced intro?
Plot twist: it's ditto because it can morph into anything
4:31 Ah yes, beef, my favorite animal
I want to consume animals.  NOW!
Why is Gabite in the place of Grachomp when yur talking about hatch rates for Pokemon-
should i eat nurse joy if she is a pokemon?
Good lord, imaging the raising of farm Pokémon. The farmer takes care of them, smiles and laughs with the Pokémon.  Then one day, leads them into a shed and just out right mirders them. (Spelling on purpose to avoid YouTube filters)
Nice to know I can eat nurse joy thanks!
Considering how big they are, I imagine a single Pokémon egg could last a week or so. Just have to seal it up tight.
before I watch this I am just going to point out we NEVER really see any other "animals" in the pokemon universe besides pokemon. So yes its very very likely a few Pokemon are raised to be food, such as Milktanks and Magikarp
Not only this is sick but it's a BAD idea because toxic is a universal move so really what is the REAL question what pokemon should not eat and should
Garchomp?! That's a Gabite
Yes, I want my Arcus well done!
6:36  PAIN SO MUCH PAIN
54minutes cause of watching game theory first
is it possible to eat jirchachi?
imagine ash and gang going to KFH for a snack while travelling through Johto
I wanna eat the very best Like no one ever was To taste them is my real test To eat is my cause I will travel across the land Searching far and wide Munching Pokémon to understand The power that's inside 😂😂😂
Aren't mudbray and mudsdale could be an inneficent source of meat since I think it is implied that most of their weight comes from the minerals in their body? Their meat would probably be pretty hard and peobably far from tasty
I eat kosher food so... no crab
And no you can't eat nurse joy because she looks too human.
Game Theory: Is Nurse Joy a Pokémon?  Me: What am I supposed to do with the information?  Food Theory: . . .
No no no no no there's nothing to say about this video except for no!!!!!!!!
MatPat just can't hold on to sanity for long, can he.
Ayyyyyyy kinda early
How high are you,matpat?
Early seasons/games of Pokemon did actually show non-Pokemon animals
*Applin is the worm not the apple * Gabite was shown not Garchomp
Vegans wold hate this video
The way he says pidove hurts my soul
Film theory idea:  I know it's a book theory but please make it Matpat. Can you please make a Percy Jackson and the heroes of Olympus book theory. I really want and love to see if you make a theory on who is stronger Percy or Jason. Please MatPat I beg you, you are the only one who would make this. I'm dieing to see who is stronger, but I can't calculate it since I'm an idiot but you have the brains to make this. Please make it
The problem with milktank is that if you consume to much of it’s milk you start to resemble it
Just passing by to suggest a monster hunter food theory:  Is the type of foods and amount a hunter eat at the canteen enough to provide enough calories/energy to fight giant dinosaurs or the food will defeat the hunter stomach before they even try?
Applin is not the apple its a worm inside it
Day 2 of asking for a video on what the Frizzle family would be charged and convicted of if they were arrested
The calories are spread out among bigger animals
:o
7:39 that's a gabite
You should make a video with Retro Gaming about Minecraft Theory oh sorry wrong Channel.....
I'm concerned
A... poultry amount of calories... Mat, that was bad but good
I'm a Nurse Joy Theory you said Chauncey eggs would Chansey not be raised for their eggs?
0:01 general matpat
As a die hard Pokemon fan, I'm super triggered at how Matt mispronounces some of their names
This video was very informative but I had to *Dislike* it because I can't stand the thought of eating a horse....... Its too unholy.....
I got in before the first hour
Great, now I want to eat a hoothoot
2:46 air I eat close to 3 whole pounds to 2 whole pounds
That vegan teacher don't approved
I'm slightly disappointed that MatPat didnt consider some other factors for this. The big one that stuck out to me is for hoot-hoot, diet, kinda obvious oversight on the food channel. Hoot-hoot being an owl would be a carnivore and without getting too far into it there are reasons we dont typically raise carnivores for food in the real world
[12:37] wailord has an extremely low weight because in the 3D games like sun & moon they made his model above the ground level and didn't want to have to edit its height. It can actually techically fly because of that, like how gyrados flies.
Garchomp Let's we put a gabite in the video 😆
Still waiting for a Conspiracy theory channel 🤔
Spearow isn't a pidgy clone it's its own bird pokemon
7:35 sir that’s not a Garchomp
I fear you are greatly underestimating animal and well Pokémon types. We don’t usually eat predator animals, much less farm them since their meat is not only leaner and tougher, but much harder to build up. The owl Pokémon (owls are birds of prey) would be terrible as poultry because you’d need to grow other Pokémon to feed it to grow to size. Also, horse meat tends to be rather lean and not most peoples preferred source of protein, so a horse whose name includes the word mud and who is a rock/earth/whatever it is type Pokémon will probably have disgustingly rocky dense lean meat.
Technically applin is the worm inside the apple so technically you can eat the apple
I do not mean to be rude, and I know that a lot of work goes into these videos, but I was surprised that no bug type Pokemon were mentioned. It is easy to find them in the wild in large quantities, and if people wanted to evolve them, it would not take that long to evolve bug Pokémon, seemingly eliminating a lot of time related to breeding and hatching Pokémon. Even if you wanted to breed them, bug Pokémon would take up a smaller amount of space, allowing for more Pokémon to be on the farm. I am sorry if I said anything wrong or offensive, that just seemed like a simple way to get food in the Pokémon world.
7:34 Matpat mi boi, that be no garchomp that be a Gabite.
Hah, the true limitless and perfect source food in pokemon universe is DItto. It is the most breedable pokemon in history, all of the speciments can turn into whatever, so you can get any food you pleases.
The most [idk, definitively something] thing about the fatness of mudsdale and mudbray is that they're pretty much the only heavy pokemons with logical masses.
Vegans ate not gonna like this
Matpat: "The ones I like to call Pidgey Clones" The Regional Birds: "bruh"
So the Pokémon world most likely consumes goat milk and owl meat… weird
Thanks for the info, ive been debating eating my pokemon
Well... Otay
But does hoothoot eat meat like an owl? That should probably be factored in.
Louie from Pikmin, where you at? We need your culinary expertise in other universes besides your own!
why
I’ve actually always wanted to eat nurse joy so I’m on board!
I’m mad for the applin joke because applin is the dragon inside the apple but Ik it was a joke
Would it be practical to include rare candies into the farm pokemon's diets to induce evolution
Good luck trying to farm a psychic type for the slaughter
Parents: "Eat your veggies!"  Me, tearfully brandishing a fork at a bowl of shredded Oddish: "Okay..."
A Game theory that could be a Film theory and a Good theory that could be a Game theory. neat
I have two ideas for "The Princess Bride" food theories. (I don't know proper theory suggestion etiquette, so I hope I don't seem pushy or lazy about this. Also, these might be a better fit for SCIENCE than a regular theory, but I digress) Theory Idea 1: What is the real world equivalent of iocane powder? And is is it possible to slowly immunize yourself to various poisons like described in the movie (let alone "one of the deadliest poisons known to man"), or would the Dread Pirate Roberts become the dead pirate Roberts? **b'dm tss** **adoring laughter** Theory Idea 2: Is it possible for a single pill to revive someone from a "mostly dead" state, and if not, what would it take? If it is possible, would someone in medieval times be capable of making such a treatment, or would Wesley be doomed to become the dead pir- (ok I'll stop now).
Lmao yo imagine going up a whole mountain going thru high lvl Pokemon to finally reach the destination where a legendary should be too see someone eating it 😂😂😭
Tip: Pokemon can be used as fuel in a furnace!
,
Before 1 hr release
Why does the appletun thing make me think of a poor old appletun bleeding because kids have eaten it too much.
The bigger question is why are normal animals so rare in the poké-world and yes there are regular animals in the poké-world in pokedex entries, card pictures etc.
You never stop ruining Pokemon for me
what on earth
Is that a new intro?
If we ate nurse Joys  it wouldn't be pokemon anymore it would be Tokyo ghoul
early
9:11 Bruh, meowth be thirsty
Is it possible for spicy foods to burn ur mouth
7:34 That's a a funky looking Garchomp. Have you been feeding him well?
7:38 u used a Gebiete instead of garchomp
7:36 That's a gabite
So does this mean I should eat my flaireon? I mean it would already be cooked
Hiya
"You should eat your pokemon" Absolutley.  I mean it's stated many times in the series that people do eat them. Not realky that dark a concept. I see it as thd same with animals. You have pokemon you keep as pets, companions ect and then pokemon you eat.  ( For example Basculin is literally stated in the Dex to be tasty, plus slowpoke tails are food. Farfetch'd was literally hunted to near extinction)
The next video is the 69th!
genger has something to say about that
Brian David Gilbert: 👀
im allergic to beef.
Wait…this…is a FOOD theory?? I saw Pokemon and thought this was game theory 😶🙃🤣
9:51 Magcargo being hotter than the sun...
My buddy Pokémon found a candy while watching this video…he better keep finding them before he finds himself on a plate 😈
Commercial fishing really wouldn't work in Pokémon, huh? Pull up a net full of fish Pokémon and suddenly one of them fires off a Hydro Pump and wrecks you. Pull up a Clauncher or a Clawitzer and that thing will punch a hole in your ship with its cannon claw. Granted people do eat their claws when they fall off 😂
Does this mean we can eat Nurse Joy?
The Intro 👀👌 Sun & Moon has shown that pokemons have been consumed, the pokedex entries were quite the read, no chill at all. To the Pokemons that were "picked" by Science to be on the platter (R.I.P) & as for the Nurse Joy Pokemon, that'll be a watch, are you going to tell me she's some sort of Chansey/healing pokemon... (Gute Vid). Hope your doing well, Keep being Awesome & Safe Bro 🍦 😎 👊  0:34 OJack Juice 0:48 Felt that 👀 3:28 👀 9:10 Skiddo 🐐11:36 Poor HootHoot 🐦 12:50 Poor  Mudbray 🐎 14:04 👀
Yes I wanna eat nurse joy
there is some problems with the use of a pokemon named after mud it could taste like mud too
What a weird looking Garchomp you have there MatPat.
too bad the show hints that people eat magicarps as their meat
This is all vaguely creepy to me, since pretty much all Pokemon have human-like intelligence. I mean, sure, people still have to eat and stuff, and Pokemon obviously eat other Pokemon, but it's uncomfortable to think about. I'm fine with farmed products and stuff, but I think I would likely be vegetarian if I lived in the Pokemon world.
All things considered I'd likely go vegetarian in the Pokemon world.
Madbrays eat, mud farming them would be efficient but I don't think they will taste very good
E
ive been asking this question for years
This is more creepy if you think that in Canon people used to marry pokémon
umm maybe we shouldent eat are little friends
No one mentioning how it shows Gabite when he mentions Garchomp?
Nice to see BDG’s neck for a split second
In one of milktank’s Pokemon entries say that if you consumed it’s milk you will transform into one
Highly concerned when I saw pokemon on food theory
Money is a big factor for diet but Religion is also a factor in diet
Youve made food theory a game theory and a film theory all on pokemon
What unholy video have i stumbled upon???
Uhh should we tell him
Is there really a distinction between Pokémon and regular “animals.”
Hey Matpat, is it possible to use the Norimaki Synthesizer (Taste Display) to create "the best flavor ever", similar to what Jimmy Neutron creates in his "Krunch Time" episode? I'm thinking the contrast between all the flavors will be too great, but like you and Steph discovered in the burger creation video it does work to a degree.  Mind exploding with all the possible theories. I need your professional guidance to solve this. This also ties in a lot of what's been covered so far. *nudge nudge*
Just wait till That Vegan Teacher makes a reaction video to this
“Garchomp” Huh?
Um yes this is something I totally wanna see in my recommendation
Did anyone notice when Matpat said Garchomp he put up a picture of Gabite
Good Video ,but it is  missing a small part.
stop please
So should we tell him applin is not the apple but a worm
Game Theory: "Nurse Joy is a Pokemon" Food Theory: "Eat your Pokemon" Eat which part tho 😳
Solid episode however my only gripe is that growth and levelling aren’t tied to one another, we see in a few examples in the anime such as the old Treeko in the Ruby and Sapphire series as well as Tracey’s elderly Scyther. Some other unevolved Pokémon also have specific traits relating to age which still remains unattached to levelling.   Think of the levelling and exp system as simply battle experience and age being a different thing entirely. With that in mind I’d probably say that Miltank is still in the lead for beef and dairy but Skiddo would be equal in terms of dairy but not meat.   And who needs meat for protein when Chancey asexually produces fantastic eggs that it already willingly shares with people and Pokémon.
I ate a ditto like bubble gum...so...
garchomp = gabite
Matpat, can you do a video on Body Armor? My family drinks the heck out of it and I can’t put my finger on what exactly it is: an energy drink, a vitamin drink, a glorified Poweraid? No clue.
Here is your "Under an hour" ticket!
I love that this theory did take into consideration vegetarians.
Y'know there's probably a weird reason Wailord is so light. Not only is it called the Float Whale Pokemon, but there's some very obvious Blimp influence in it's shape, so Wailord would not only not yield very dense meat for it's size, it's also literally full of hot air. They should probably make it a Flying Type since it would most likely just float away like a proper blimp.
I dare people to Google Image Search Eating Pokémon
I wonder matpat  did you consider  certain  pokemon  don't  exist in all regions ?
According to MatPat's old theories, humans are Pokemons, so . . . .
Wait .... did you say Land is cheap in America?!?! Hahahaha good joke
Don’t mind what I do
7:38 garchomp inserts a image of grabite
I have no beef against MatPat, I have no problem with this theory. I am intrigued and interested. But something inside me started to broil like Hades' sauna when they showed a "Gabite" and called it "Garchomp". I don't understand what this feeling is. Is it hate? Remorse? Perhaps it is me, a man with no life who decided to be petty enough to comment a paragraph about a video talking about farming methods in a game about monsters that fight under the command of their 10 year old masters for money. Whatever the case, this will remain as a stain on my conscience.
yummy.
Lol so many comments already
Omg you're making me hungry man... gonna leave a like and get lunch. Anyone else hungry?
Hey, what’s your favourite food? Nurse Joy.
3:53 "why do we use use specific animals for food"
I never looked at the weights of Pokemon.
Now do the same theory for every gen separately You can't expect me to drink skidoo milk and eat hoothoot and mudsdale in Hoenn region which is definitely imported from other regions everyday.
I wonder if people hunt bird pokemon with guns
really kool
This is simultaneously horrifying as it is fascinating.
says garchomp shows gabite
Nah, I think i'll pass
Applin is not the apple. They are the worm inside the apple.
Mudbray and Mudsdale are my fav pokemons. :(
Aren't there pokemon used as a food source that aren't killed? Lots of plant pokemon grow fruits that you can probably only get from them, and lets be honest, pokedex information from 10 year olds ain't gonna be that accurate
Why didn't factor in region differences? For one not all Pokemon are native to every region, and two different regions will have different tastes due to availability. Kanto and Johto are based on islands of Japan and as such it would make a lot more sense for those regions to be more fish and pultry focused than say the regions based off European countries
Game theory on something pokemon unite related?
07:40 Mat:”Garchomp” *Proceeds to show Gabite.*
I feel like Hoot Hoot would be a lot of protein, same as the Mudbray. Might be too tough to eat.
I hear that onyx your edible I'm going to eat you
Everytime I find a Pokémon fan in the wild I like to ask what Pokémon they think would taste best? I often get a confused judgmental look back. I think magic carp would make a great sushi roll
Yeah no, all because krabby eating videos
*coughs* VEGAN TEACHER'S NIGHTMARE
Nurse Joy is an anime character, making it a Film Theory.
"before it reaches adulthood, like caviar...." yeah, thats realy far away from reaching adulthood but in the same category as eggs i guess?
Polygon's Brian David Gilbert already did it. Lol
I'm calling the police
Question about the 10:35 graphic. Does the efficiency just count for feed vs caloric output? OR does it account for the maturity time as well?
Mmmmm crunchy ;)
I love this theory but I do have some additional thoughts. Each pokemon selected for consumption on a daily basis are from different regions of the pokemon world. Would this be the cause of a pokemon world trading distribution for each region exchanging with one another? Would each region have their own different food source? For example Kanto and hoenn in the games have a ton of water pokemon. So would the people of those regions have more water pokemon in there diets then other regions? Would people of one region prefer to grow and raise one pokemon over another bases on the region's resource or would they import them in to save money? I would love a Milktank steak. Anyway that's just food for thought. Thank you theorist crew for making this video.
Did anybody else say "Yum" in their head or out loud when he said Beef, Pork, Chicken?
7:34 That's a Gabite, not a Garchomp. 11:04 Fletchling, not Fetchling. And Pidove is said the same way as Pidgey.
Pokemons do evolve in the wild tho. They dont have to battle, as it ages it evolves. A charmander is a baby charizard for example. Battling just makes them evolve faster!
I don't eat it 😕 🤷
7:34 Are the editors messing with Mat? That's clearly a Gabite when he said Garchomp.
I'd eat out nurse joy... And officer jenny
I love how much Mat hated saying "milkable"
I dont care if a topic has already been done I would still rather watch you talk about it than someone else
I see pokemon on food theory, Yep Mat's gone mad again😪
About magikarp: didnt misty say something to james in one of the episodes that you couldnt eat magikarp as it is literally just bone?
Hmm i think mudbray is heavy bc its part actual earth. Not muscle
Type of Pokémon I would eat: Primarina’s cooter and hooters. If you catch my drift. 😏
Waint a minute If Pokémons are noen from eggs, why does Milktank give mill? #Theoryforanotherday
nurse joy and which pokemon has the best milk  doesnt go good
So i should (theoretically) eat Nurse Joy.
I CAN SMELL THAT!
Do one about ALL of the food in _Star Wars_ …
12:47 there are two imposters among us
Me watching this after realizing nurse Joy is a blissey
Good that is ur 69th video
but mudbray probably tastes like... well mud
"And immediately when I say dairy pokemon I'm sure there's one that pops into everyones mind-" Nurse Joy?
No Pokemon expert, but owls are carnivores.  Not sure your going to be able to farm them efficiently if you have to raise a bunch of Rattata first.
Hi I want my comment to be seen
You showed us a habits when u said it was a garchomp but that a miner mistake
That's sad
I think there was a horrible misinterpretation of Farfetch'd pokedex entry. When it says Farfetch'd makes a delicious meal especially when cooked with leek they meant Farfetch'd are skilled chefs and can prepare a great meal especially meals that call for leek. So many Farfetch'd died because of this.
7:34: That is a gabite. Not garchomp.
Pokémon are food. Nurse joy is a Pokémon and therefore food. Brock sure gonna enjoy eating nurse joy
Ohh my god he actually didn’t eat  appilin the apple isn’t it’s body it’s a dragon worm on the inside it’s confirmed by the model look it up imagine he isn’t a true theorist missing a small detail that takes 5 seconds in the video in the intro honestly I’m disappointed (sarcasm if your a bit special and couldn’t tell)
The vegan teacher: *staring intensely*
Plot twist: people in the Pokémon world eat plant based meat. Like who with good heart would eat such adorable creature! But that applen fact was pretty disturbing and unexpected.
But nurse joy is a Pokémon.
"Skidoo" "Muckrow"
Do a video on Wakfu with Quilbe
That GameBoy Color “Food Theory” intro was clean af and appreciate the throwback.
I wouldn't mind eating nurse Joy. Or vice versa
These bots are everywhere on YouTube.
Btw cow milk isnt good for you for many reasons ☺
I think the best Pokémon to raise is Tropius because not only is it hatched fully mature, it also produces its own berries naturally. Few Pokémon provide both meat and vegetation, and even fewer provide it adequately directly after birth. If you live in a tropical climate, farming Tropius is easily your best bet
So... nurse Joy hatched out of an egg?
One thing missing, taste. Im sure there are plenty of pokemon that would be easy to raise and farm, but how would a mudsdale taste? From the little I know about hunting, owls probably taste VERY gamy.
I would expect a ground pokemon to have less weight in meat and more in minerals.  probably not the best choice
Wow he pronounces so many Pokémon incorrectly
"Long-range scans indicate that the evolution patterns in this planet are sparse"
When you say "eating" Nurse Joy...
Mat pat: mudbray is efficient for food Me, knowing the anime shows a mudsdale farm and explicitly states that they take a TON of work to raise: *_* Edit: there was supposed to be to asterisks around the underscore but because I’m dum I forgot that just made the underscore bold
What the ffff
Pie-dove and Noo-mule  😆
7:38 is a gabite not garchomp
I remember when May said that she was so hungry she could eat a Tauros (Pokémon advanced episode 4)
Nurse Joy is a Pokémon 🤣
7:34 That's a Gabite lol
lol  vegan lady is going to react
Video should be called - you should devour small creatures while alive and screaming!
Pokemon Farm Simulator 2022 incoming
I was bored of football games and installed Pokemon Red yesterday. How lucky I am.
Good video Matt, you should try mrbeast burger
Yeah good luck catching a wailord, their size to weight ratio literally tells that they are lighter than air.
Fletchling isn’t a pidgy clone Fletchling is good
I wondered how ash and his friends get food...
theres also the pokemon sun and moon anime,  one of their families own a farm known for their miltank milk
Nah he just got hungry and thats why he decided to be
would grumpig be considered brain food since it's psychic type?🤔
12:48  Metagross isn’t a legendary Pokémon though
You only eat the pokemon that die in pokemon nuzlokes
Ive been saying this for years If I lived in the poke' world I would open a restaurant; basculine strips, miltank burgers,
garchomp? looks like a gabite to me mat patt...
Matpat: pidgey clones  Everyone else: route one flying types
Machop would be protein rich
7:35 Mat you need to have a talk with your editor, that is gabite, not garchomp
Me: **reads title** WHAT THE FU- MatPat **provides proof**  Me: Uh- alright then
eat nurse joy... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Considering most of the heft behind Mudbrey and Mudsdale is due to the clay the roll around and is on their manes: maybe not cooking up a nice horse vase is for the best.
*Ambiguous Episode.*  I could tell.
Applen isn't a apple ic a worm in a apple dough
Just finish the nurse joy episode and this is Pokémon week on the Chanels right? It's cannibal week again cause we are Pokémon and we're talking on how to eat them
28 MINS
It's worth noting, at least in the first couple of seasons, that actual, normal animals exist, inferred from how many references they make to animals, especially the ones that didn't have pokemon versions at the time, like pigs and muskrats
Finally New content
I'm going to stick to combusken meat, chancey eggs and gogoat cheese
But if nurse you IS a pokeymon, and I should EAT Pokémon, THEN…
Ok MatPat you’ve crossed the line
Miltank is expensive to raise because it needs tons of berries to recover from even minor illnesses. And during that time, illtank = no MMM
so we gonna be eating nurse joy?
The vegan teacher: 👀
Interesting.....
I figure I should point out that real life animals do exist in pokemon, although they are highly rare. This means that it is very possible that the pokemon world could very simply hold slaughterhouses for real life animals to preserve the superior animals - the mystical Pokemon - for pets and enslaved fighters. Though we never see any slaughterhouses, so odds are this is just speculation and nothing more. Don't believe that real animals exist in the pokemon world? Look it up~!
When Mat mentioned Chicken, first thing came to mind was Blaziken making low-key hope that Mat would discuss how people will fight a Muay Thai Fire Chicken.
As hoothoot is based off of owls, it would have poor caloric efficiency when eaten (as a top predator) Therefore, I feel it was the wrong choice
pokemon movie came to Netflix that talk about living with pokemons  matpat: It's time!!
This is another level of "disturbing". Thank you. Please continue.
Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a Pokemon. Also Game Theory: Eat your Pokemon.
doesnt the team rocket hunting pokemon to sell them to rich people so they can eat exotic animal?? i always tought that was why
WHAT IS POKEMON FOOD MADE OF
You could continue with this topic to take in consideration if it would ve Best top export the products of one region to another, for examples for Jhoto It would be best to export skidoo milk from Kalos or It would be cheaper to use milktank milk
Hey mat go watch the sun and moon pokemon anime and look at kiawe's family *farm*
....
*lists first set of birds “Please say medium fast” *medium slow; puts hoot hoot in other category  “Don’t say him don’t say him don’t say” *Hoot Hoot is easily the best bird option “NOOOOOOOOO”
"Some people call me the food theorist!" I'm pretty sure they don't, Matt Patt. You'll always be the game theorist.
Snorlax would be easy to hunt for big gains
I love coffing leave his goofy self alone
Don't be fooled. Vanillites actually taste like horrid dirty ice.
7:34 Thats a small Garchomp..and less purple
if humans eat pokemon and humans are pokemon do humans eat humans   written before watching the video
Matpatt you forgot about flamebody im sure farmers would use that to speed up hatching time.
why do you need a membership for Costco?
Spearow would be delicious
what are you doing, step trainer?
Some want to eat them other want to Boink them
8:40 in..... bugs are gonna be the best value isent it. Looks at caterpie.
Eat pokemon huh? Well...i dont think Litwick or its evolutions..nor muk or grimer...would be very edible (or tasty for that matter)
Dark
watching this at 2 am feeling good
Thank you MatPat, I’m going to go eat my Necrozma now 😂
Ash goes num num on charmander
e
et pokman ahfahafhafhafhafhafah
I feel a bit of pain that he used a picture of Gabite as a Garchomp, but this is a pretty good video
Yummy
waiting for the food, video, and game theorist personalities to diverge and compete to conquer youtube
How is mudbray good at everything? Its even good for food
I can finally eat my torchic with a little krabby and maybe some umbreon curry
Next episode: We're all cannibals. Since according to Game Theory, humans and Pokemon are one in the same. Also, don't eat the Nurse Joys, there are far better and pleasurable uses for her.
Should I eat nurse Joy? Too adult?
I actually have a card of hoot hoot it says here that hoot hoot are only large and heavy because of their feathers.
what would a magikarp taste like
Oh my God guys this video is the 69 food theory video.i can't belive it.(can't wait for film theory's 420th video)
Yummy. Shiny Magikarp tastes S000 good
Mat, what the f**k were you thinking when you came up with this "theory" 😕
Just don’t eat my Lucario…
I can't wait for peta to try to cancel you for saying that people eat pokémon
That's no garchomp  😅
Not considering any of the bug Pokemon. Smh
this video is going to tik off a *lotta* vegans
Aplen is the little warm inside of the Apple
“And the pre evolved forms of Pokémon like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Garchomp..” *Shows Gabite*
*proceeds to eat a Bulbasaur salad*
Ok I disagree on seafood not being considered pescatarians and seafood lovers are a factor matpat I beg to differe from many fishing town and cities close to the coast beg to differ  I demand a seafood option in this channel for pokemon
As a vegan I have to say..the only Pokemon I'd eat out is Nurse Joy, if you know what I mean.
Oh great, now I can eat Pokémon noodles soup or Heinz Pokémon pasta made back in the 2000s
3:19 you know that cloud scared little kids so it's not going to happen 💗😇🌸🎃
People do eat pokemon... many episodes show Magikarp Sashimi,Farfetch'd Soup,Tentacool-amari,Scrambled Togepi and of course Slowpoke Tail
"why try to have friends when you know you can make a new channel and be your own best friend"  -matpat
Eating Nurse Joy... Well, i will go to Reddit with the thought i currently have.
11:11 did he just say "Muk-crow"???
I'm gonna go eat my trubbish, THANKS MATPAT!
Don't eat them they are living creatures
So according to the titles, you should eat nurse joy
Did anyone else notice when he said civilians he added nurse joy even though he just released a video on how nurse joy is a Pokémon? 😂
"The only things that outclass it in weight are legendaries!" Mega Metagross: ........ ignore me...
Show me pokemon theorys *game theory* I said show me pokemon theorys *film theory* I SAID SHOW ME POKEMON THEORYS *food theory* Perfection
Ha he said boils down and he is talking about food
Don’t they already have animals? Like cows and other animals?
...!?!?!?
Now I don’t know for sure, but I suspect Matpat is in the top 1% of the world. I love the guy and love his content, but him suggesting he isn’t rich is disingenuous.
Haven't finished the episode yet but I'm gonna say that certain types as a whole should be inedible. Like poison, rock, ground, and steel. Flying normal and water types would be eaten most .
Y mathpat is this a think and there is a indian utuber that copy ed your thing mythpat is his name and has 20 million
I have loved all the real world science for Food Theory, but having it applied to Pokemon is always fun.
Why do we use specific animals for meat? Well, here's some fact fodder for ya... 1) We don't usually eat predators. While there are exceptions like snake, and the occasional omnivore like pig, most food animals are prey, like cow, chicken, sheep, deer, buffalo, etc. In fact, there are some predators we can't eat, like wolves who are so high in vitamin E that they're basically toxic if you eat enough. But here's the real bombshell: 2) We usually eat female animals. We eat cow, not bull. We eat chicken, not rooster. Again, there are exceptions like deer, where we eat both buck and doe, but the majority of food animals are female. Of course, part of that is about breeding, but it's also because many male animals, like bulls, have tough, unpalatable meat. Then there's all the eggs and milk we get from females.  This even extends to plants. Of course, plant gender is irrelevant for most veggies like root veggies and greens, but think about all of the "seeds" we eat. Grains, nuts, beans, legumes, and even fruits are all types of seed, all harvested from female plants.
What would someone in kanto eat. There’s no hoothoot mudbray or gogoat
Can we have a pt. 2 about fish and other type of food categories
I wonder if you could just eat the Pokémon’s egg, before it hatches? And would it taste different depending on the Pokémon that you got the egg from?
7:33 "and Garchomp" *shows Gabite*
Wait joy is a pokemon? Since when? What
Food theory: why you should eat your Pokémon Game theory: why nurse joy is a Pokémon  So should we eat nurse joy
7:37 That sure is a Garchomp.
4:31 "Beef is actually one of the more profitable animals for farmers to raise." Ah yes, beef, my favorite animal.
.....
Dont eat owl friend hoothoot ;-;
1:42 thats dark oak   thats very dark…
I'd eat Nurse Joy
wtf mat pat
Hello
i just read the title and i got my fouces
i bet technoblade tastes yum
This episode is this weird more then Other ones!
Thanks, I HATE it
Applin is a worm in an apple, Applin isn't the apple  and it's Murr-crow, not mukcrow
I don't know about the Hootoot man. Carnivores often don't really taste that good, except for fish. It is quite heavy and fast to raise, but if it tastes bad I'm not sure people would eat it.
personally i love eating snivy
Isn't Hoothoot an owl, and therefore a predator? Predators eat meat which would require another meat source, which would make them inefficient because we could just eat their food(meat).  TL;DR: If Hoothoots are predators they probably aren't the poultry food of choice.
I think based in the outline set everyone would definitely be eating bug Pokemon most likely caperpie and other early bugs
Dairy pokemon? My first thought is Vanilluxe
The Pokémon cafe references were so good, I love the game so much and it’s such a good past time
Isn't the weight given with added bones?
I just got off of a video game and this is first video I see.
This made me remember what Ironmouse said to Connor and it scarred me forever...
Owl meat is so disgusting. I wouldn’t recommend you ever eat it.
How much would roasted zygarde cost? Probably over $1million for only one meal
So some Pokémon are equivalent to people while others are treated as nothing less than food. Coool
They said garchomp but showed a picture of gabite
missed opportumity to use beef milk as your 1 %er milk
7:35 that's a weird looking garchomp
There are already Pokémon which are food.
What is the music you used in the video from the start to 3:39
IF CHICKEN IS A $0.97 PER LB THEN WHY THE F*** DOES IT COST $20 AT THE STORE. CAPITALISM EXPLAIN.
So... thats the most edible pokemon
LOL
Food Theory Idea: The Ultimate Hangover Cure, according to science
I must nitpick. that was a gabite not a garchomp smfh
Noooooooooooooo
Every channel have a Pokémon video
This is the most interesting food theory episode I've ever seen
What happen to the intro?
7:35 thats a wierd looking garchomp and 12:50 he puts a mega metagross as a legendary  i dont think matpat understands pokemon at all
For applin, remove the little worm dragon first ;)
I'm on my way yo Unova to catch a few Tepig, anyone want bacon?
Wait, are there no mammal Pokémon?
Pokemon full course meal. Pokemon full course meal. Pokemon full course meal.
Useless fact this video was posted one minute before the game theroy video
this theory brought up an interesting question for me to ask. If you consider a torchic to being the equivalent to a chicken in our world, then since torchic is a fire type and obviously has the ability to spit out fire, would it's meat already be considered cooked or would you have to cook it anyways despite the fact that it probably has a fire in its body that could already be cooking the meat for us?
Hi
But how much of Mudbray's weight comes from it's caked-on mud and ground typing?
Feed them rare candy to level up
I got a Pokémon ad before this video
Mmmmmmm... digsby has a use for once!
when people do a running marathon give everyone of them an poke egg. fastest way to hatch the eggs. once there hatched they get a new egg.
Does mudbray come with mud on the side
Sir, how is your mental health?  I'm not asking because of the video, just in general.
haven't even watched the video but I'd glady eat that garde-
Yea
I don’t agree with that it’s because of money we eat certain animals it has to with domistication. Some animal are easier to farm and does not have to be hunted.
29 mins the theory channels are the best tbh
My cinderace in the corner
I'd love some fried pikachu.
Hoothoot is chonky      I am not sorry
Ah thanks for uploading right when i make noodles.
The slaking that was fed 50,000,000 berries:
Editors: Puts Gabite into where Mat says Garchomp Me: THATS NOT GARCHOMP THATS GABITE!!!!! 7:34
Also pokemon can evolve with time 2
Who wants scrabbled exeggcute and some tempig strips, one me. >XD
matpat what is this
So Professor Oak was really just giving us a menu?
7:34 editor, that's a gabite. Somebody probably mentioned that allergist but, time stamp
"the Poisson gas pokemon"  mat-'nope nope nope' OMG, why did you have to give my head those ideas?
7:35 you showed gabite when it was garchomp
Sun and Moon says that slowpoke tails are delicious. This is said in mandatory cutscene.
0:01
Hoot Hoot I imagine would not be a very tasty dish considering the fact that owls IRL do not taste very good at all.
J
my family raises goats a little... we only have 2 but i still like them, i mean they are pets moreso than food but they are still adorable little creatures.
I... I don't know if I like you anymore...
7:34 that’s gabite
Let’s munch on the nurse      *mmMMMMmMmMM*
I knew that in this episode they had to say a Pokemons name and show a different one. MatPat: "Garchomp" Video: *Go Gabite
just finished the game theory episode, anyone else ?
YUMMYYYY
I'm not gonna lie, now we need a couple follow up videos focusing on seafood and possibly analyzing each region and what Pokemon are found there.  Obviously Mudbray and Hoothoot are good for food but they cant be found in Kanto or Unova, so if we arent taking exports and imports into account, what would the people of each region be using for food.
O
Dear matpat ,are u okay? Do u need a therapist?
O
O
Eating pokemons is fine, just like animals. But fighting with them for fun and medals is like, making your pet dog fight with other owners dog.
Hmm, wouldnt you factor in regions ? since theyre not all from the same region?
O
O
remember don't eat the metal Pokémon!
O
Actually, applin isn’t the Apple. It’s the cute little dragon that lives inside the Apple, when they’re born they crawl into in apple and slowly eat it, eventually they evolve based on if it was a sweet or tart apple. If you eat the apple, it’ll just find a new one
7:38 Wait.... That’s not Garchomp! That’s a Gabite!
Thx
O
O
that isn't Garchomp my dude
What have you done?!
O
O
O
Well that Low level vaporeon I caught a few years ago will definitely come in handy :)
O
Me when I saw this title: YO YO WTF!?
O
d-did he call gabite garchomp? ;-;
>Video suggestion: Game Theory: Nurse Joy is a Pokemon!  Oh no!
spearow is not a pidgey clone mat, he appeared alongside him as an alternative, pidgey is a 3 stage pokemon and spearow is a 2 stage pokemon, those are the two starter bird types, like hoothoot would be the spearow clone, not a pidgey clone due to havin 2 stages instead of 3.
O
O
O
So you're telling me if I've got a ditto and a magikarp I'm set for life
............................................
O
Poker mon
O
As if the Pokémon fighting  each other wasn’t bad enough, they are hunted for food
3:54 typo
Make sure PETA isn't watching.  Eh~ who am i kidding. They already blocked this channel.🤣🍖
O
This episode made me hungry. And I just ate. I want some hoothoot. I'll try a mudbray,  I already like goat milk, so no difference from skidoo.  Also! They. All. Come. From. Eggs. You can eat those for protein. My only question is, would they taste different depending on the species?
O
O
O
Brock is definitely going to eat Nurse Joy, just not the way MatPat is talking about.
7:38 So um who's going to tell him?
BDG is quaking
milktank is bad for milk read pokedex
Mmm, my favorite food, ditto!
“Dragonite, tyranitar and Garchomp.” **shows Gabite** **I chuckle because of my superior knowledge** @7:33
NOOOO
What is wrong with you
oh food theorie
The best dairy Pokémon is obviously Nurse Joy, not Skidoo.
Where is land cheap in the US?
yea this is sketchy is this a coidnce or no cuz i just bought pokemon cards and got a pikachu and bought some plushies of pokemon right after
Hello
Oi was like wait what channel was this and then I realized it was food theory
Ive been woundering this question for a very long time, just like any logical person. Also isnt Applin the worm in the apple, not the apple?
Oh no matter lost his mind zonika
If we taking about video games food is batim is the bacon soup good for Henry
MatPat: “…and Garchomp” Editor: Gabite
In Pokémon your options are plants, Pokémon, and Pokémon plants
Matpat. Please. You've been making Pokemon theories for years. Learn how to pronounce their names.
I’m pretty sure it’s cannon people in Pokémon games definitely eat slowpoke tail since it can grow back but other than that idk what people are eating protein wise
Miltank is literally steak. I would fillet that creature in like 2 minutes flat. CURSE YOU WHITNEYYY
Uhhh... mudbray is a ground type, so unless you like muddy donkey meat I would avoid eating it. It's much better for manual labor.
3:19 I was eating a sandwich and this blew my mind 😭
Honestly this has been my question since I was a kid
I can't remember the name of the fish but James clearly States that it is ready for the sushi bar it's the helpless fish
You didn’t have to eat applin, the apple is not part of its body, it’s just a ordinary apple, but the worm is applin
Instructions not clear, ate my pet mouse.
7:34 Ah Yes,  Garchomp
Vandalised title: Yes, you should evolve your Pikachu.
Ash used the pokedex on koffing for four reasons   One: he hadn’t seen a koffing in a long time  Two: he has a new pokedex which didn’t have that data  Three: there is always new data being discovered about each Pokémon so ash needing to be updated makes sense  And four: it was for new audiences
Pokemon weights gets weird as you dig into it.
Wow i am amazed
I mean its not that bad if u thank abot it for one we eat sayyy pigs and cows but we dont eat like caats and dogs in dat wrold pokemon are jost anmies right.
Where's Brian David Gilbert at
Legendaries are probably rarely eaten because of how power and dangerous they are
If you ate whinty miltank it would be tender from rollouting my cyndaquil
Hi
Hi
Just got done with the Nurse Joy Theory now I am Wondering if Nurse Joy is a pokemon do people EAT nurse joy's?
yes, eat the giant yellow tazer rat.
Vegan teacher: watches this video.also vegan teacher: has a heart attack.
actually if you eat an applins apple it doesn't hurt it since applin is the creature inside not the apple
Yes part of a balanced YouTube diet. Gasoline to gaslight people. I will become Optimus prime.
man uploaded this video before the nurse joy video
Hi
Applin is a worm in an apple are you sure you want to eat one
pokemon legends right now: mmmm steamed pokemon
what
I'm sorry WHAT THE FU-
Awh yeah, Mat Pat making my dream of eating nurse joy even more realistic.
>.> matpat forgets the efficiency of a pokemon with flame body(cuts number steps in half) and exp candies >.>
Its alright known in Pokémon sword and sheild
Ummm this title makes me uneasy
I don't even play Pokemon
I’d eat Nurse Joy 😏
Mattpat that was a gabite not a garchomp
I learned that Mudsdale was so much heavier than Wailord in a run where Jebediah (my Mudsdale lol) learned a move that does damage by how much bigger he is than the Pokémon it’s used against. So I looked up his weight vs everyone else and he’s the second biggest. And I was like “wtf, isn’t there a giant whale?” Lol
Wth bruh
1- what the hecc is this video. I like it.  2- DUDE HERE IS SO MUCH BOTS!!!!!
Bdg moment
I’ve been wondering this for years now, thank you matpat.
This so so weird!!! I just started working on a "pokemon cookbook" withal makes dishes put of pokemon
Have cake ✨🍰✨
MatPat: you should eat your Pokémon Me: W H A T
Who remembers the Pokemon cereal
You know that applens apple is not part of its body it would just find another apple
This is such a coincidence, I just finished watching detective pikachu and now he’s made a Pokémon video
Brock will want the Nurse Joy Meat
7:33 that is a gibite not a garchomp
I have no idea why I think eating a living apple is weird and disgusting
Vapeoreon: you guys aren't being eaten?
Why don’t you make a theory that Nurse Joy & Officer Jenny aren’t human and reproduce asexually. They’re clones or something
0:12 that's what I call Fight or Flight response😂🤣😂🤣
eating nurse joy 😏
I'm simply amazed it took him this long to get to this topic.
Wait a game, film, and food theory? Talk about a 3 for 3
Does any one know the song thats playing when hes talking about mudsdale
Peta started to watch your channel with great interest now haha
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"mmm, this ditto tastes like fish! Oh, wait, now it's steak. Weird."
It could also put this on the game theory channel
yum
Mat that’s gabite not garchomp
Two pokemon videos at once wha?
Death of the Author, I choose to believe there is no pokemon eating in the pokemon world.  Its all pokemon-produce product like slowpoke are meant to grow and lose tails, shuckles aren't harmed in the juicing, moo moo milk, plants that aren't pokemon (you see rice, seaweed, lettuce, corn, beans and such all the time in universe).
plz make a theory on ben 10 alien force
If you see this I hope you have a good day
if nurse joy is a pokemon then why leave out her milk 🙃?
Meme: mat pat you can eat pokemon:gorden ramse "today youll be making pokemon for me,a few dreams shaderd later"finnaly some good fuking food.
why didnt u take the applin out of the apple before eatting it? it prob would have tasted even better
That Vegan Teacher is typing. 😳
you have lost it mat
Next time we're talking about Pokémon that eat people.
Hey MatPat, quick question for you from just reading this thumbnail... Have you considered going to church? Repenting for this?
Less than 20 minutes ago early
matpat we're all concerned cause what made u make this theory
Vaporeon is my favorite Pokémon nooo😭😭
"Hi, Id like to order some of that juicy Pikachu. Oh yeah, and a side of Bulbasaur please, thank you."
You forgot about fish IRL and ingame
This went dark rapidly
Quin69 : Where were the heals?! Me at the end of this video :  Where were the links?!
So...we should eat Nurse Joy?
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of Pokémon livestock raising...
Me, reading the tile of the video: matpat.... don't do this matpat......
Farming simulator 20 yaaa
If you have a professor name Matpat...    *run*
Say you've lost it, without saying you've lost it
Mmmm  yes, Gabite the Garchomp - 7:40
Never expected this
Dont eat pokemon T - T
Opens youtube this morning ……oh…
1:53 I'm sorry *WHAT?*
I’m early and good job The Food Theorist a.k.a Food Theory
I mean how would they eat
Wow you have GIVE me the info :never go watch Pokémon
I love this channel for these kinds of content lmao
Seprise they dit not do Pokemon theory Next to the game, the anime is realy big So film theory
I was just playing pokemon ruby man what the heck
:)
Pokemon😞🤝😁 😁🤝😞 🤒🤝😡
ummm.......
Wha-what?
Matpat how can you so dark
Ok
Matthew patthew
6:34 Well... I definitely did not need to see that, but ok.
That Vegan Teacher watching this video: *Writing and X every time a MatPat mentions an animal* I'm sorry Mathew Patrick but you have failed *starts singing a cringy vegan song*
Sees the title Me: Matpats taking not being the jeopardy host harder than I thought.
I want to eat Nurse Joy 😏
You monster why would you eat a poison type
Slowpoke is delicious.
uhhh matpat that's a gabite
“Ok Pikachu, time to eat! What? Yes this is Bulbasaur! Doesn’t he taste good?!
Couldn't keep games away from the food channel haha
So... Is MissingNo. a good source of vitamins and nutrients?
No, stop it, stop ruining our childhood!
7:36 That my good sir, is NOT Garchomp on the right. That's Gabite
Any1 up to eat some steel types?
Remember guys eat your pets
*BDG polygon video flashbacks*
Nurse Joy's actually a chancey
There's no way you uploaded this after telling us Nurse Joy is a pokemon 😭😭😭
Thats gabite not garchomp
7:37 thats not a garchomp matpat, thats its pre evolved form Gabite ^^" point still stands tho ;)
F
Honestly, I would be surprised if you couldn’t hop over to your local food chain and grab a fried picachu when you’re hungry
Matpat: What would people in the world of pokemon eat? Me: Just read the manga smh
So I guess the people who catched the dodo bird really had to catch them all
Poor Applin
But what if Ditto became a different pokemon, could we still harvest from Ditto.
i get protein from bread, nothing else just bread :3
Now time to eat nurse joy
Interesting
Hi
this comes into real life ethics of the food industry i think
eat plants?
Is this game theory ? NO this is food Theorists
Matt Patt I think pokedex means that children will eat the sweet nectar from it's back AKA caramel.
Matpat your supposed to eat the skin not the whole Animal it's like eating the orange without peeling it
Nice for ruining my childhood
It’s official, MatPat might have gone a little crazy
Hi
wha-
00:00 General Kenobi!
How hoothoot so dense tho
Don't make Sam into a drink
Well I think I would stay away from eating steel and poison type pokemon personally
Mmm Electric meat
Pokédex says that Chansey/Blissey eggs are super nutritious so they give it to humans and other Pokémon to help them grow or heal faster. So basically Chansey willingly give up their would-be baby Happiny to others as food regularly
not a theory
That puts a new spin on a Pokebowl!
Well it's time to eat nurse joy
is it just me or does applin look like pearl jam
Here before mustacheless guy
Claim your here before 1k views here
I think you should make an episode that when you make a tournament of pizza brands
You should eat your Pokemon cuz Wynaut?
But why , why whould you do that ?
I would respect anyone that could eat Snorlax
I haven't watched the video but how can we cancel you?
What I wanna know is what MatPat’s opinion is about eating Nurse Joy. If she’s a Pokemon, would we be able to eat her?
Me: video released 12 mins ago. 1,024 comments'
Should've rung up Brian David Gilbert.
Poggers
how dare you
Rank Pokémon edibility
7:35 Love the fact that we have pixel Dragonite, pixel Tyranitar, and official art GABITE (that isn't Garchomp).
My childhood is ruined…
The 1k
"dragonite, tyranitar, and garchomp" proceeds to show dragonite, tyranitar, and a gabite"        at least he's keeping in line with the anime
Do you think charmander is to charizard what burger patties is to wagyu steak
cant wait to take a bite out of my muk
0:19 technically, Applin is the worm, not the apple, so Applins don't grow on trees either. But nice joke regardless.
Well, time to eat my first edition hollow Charazard.
11:02 legit thought you were about to start a pokerap lol
Who picked food theory first and who picked game theory first?
Mukrow am i right
Learning stupid mandarin while watching this. I speak English and hate travelling so no point but that’s school
Imagine when you release your Pokemon or send them on Poke jobs they’re actually being turned to food. Also I ruined my childhood even more with this comment. Disturbing but good video too
Did they not already post this video? I could have sworn i watched this yesterday
E
Finally
It's not a Theory channel until you're unsure if a Pokémon theory belongs there or not
Ok matpat y'all good?
I do it
Who’s that Pokémon a idiot not trying to be mean
I cannot believe I am going to be that guy but at 7:35 the pokemon they call Garchomp is actually Gabite. Gabite is the pre-evolution to Garchomp.
MatPat: "You should eat your pokemon!" Pikachu: "PIKA- CHUUUUUUUUUU"
Mmm 😋 Pikachu
You know, it was only a matter of time that Food Theory got to Pokemon, I just didn't expect it to go like this.
Purchase your before 100,000 veiws here.
i mean i would want to get some fried spicy combusken legs
Gives another definition to "gotta catch 'em all" huh?
Ok but you never answered how cost efficient Nurse Joy would be per pound 🥴
Childhood: ruined.
Matpat has lost it that's at least what I can gather from the cover of the video
Mat: says on the sister channel that Nurse joy is a pokemon Me in this video: so if I eat Nurse Joy it's caniblism but not caniblism... ok
Guess ima eat hoot hoot wing シ
I would like some fried magikarp
*BIG BRAIN*
Applin has to be one of the most nutritious meals, its protein with the dragon/worm thing on the inside, and the apple on the outside. Protein and fruit in a small bite
im not eating my eevee.
Garchomp... Gabite
Matpat: Go check out our sister Game Theory. Me: Wait they have a gender- Well good for her!
Rule of thumb for 10 year olds: Eat your Pokémon before they eat you.
Mat really pulled a doofenshmirtz, and found a brand new bestfriend and it's himself
oh ya cuz there are no cows and stuff so where do you get your meat
Me looking at my brother wearing his Halloween Pikachu costume
what a silly question of course you should eat them
I mean. When you make an apple pokemon. This just becomes inevitable.
Hey
game theory: "Nurse Joy is a Pokemon"  food theory: "Yes, You SHOULD Eat Your Pokemon"  me: i dont like where this is going
ah yes! I'm so hungry. I think its time to grill my lovely miltank........
7:33 “And pre-evolved forms of rare pokemon like Drangonite, Tyranotar, and Garchomp” puts a picture of Gabite. LOL. Also just to clarify this is not to hate on the editors.
How peculiar that this video and the game theory video uploaded at the same time about nurse joy being a pokemon are existing You're telling me Nurse Joy is edible?
I mean.. it makes sense that they eat pokemon since we eat animals
Food theory: can a macdonalds milkshake be classed as a ice cream
6:37 Your welcome
Intro fake applin is the worm
Bro that’s a Gabite not a garchomp
Another masterpiece by the one and only matpat
You should talk about star park
Man peta is gonna have a fit over this.
I know someone that could make some good sushi out of Magikarp
Rip my childhood-
i guess eating cute things are the rage these days 😔😳
pretty sure Tatsu (mc of the "The way of the househusband" anime), watched your video about the whole buffet thing and how to get most out of your money. tbh the anime is quite good though its style might not be for everyone, but you should give it a try, its quite funny at times.
Woah I'm early :0
Finally something good
Holy crap, between all your Chanel’s y’all upload so much good quality videos. Keep it up man and don’t burn out
Magikarp is also edible
No
read the title and i was like excuse me. like seeing pokemon on food theory is concerning lol
_gotta eat ‘em all!_
"You're awfully cute. But unfortunately for you, you're made of meat."  - Sokka
Okay it's gonna be that kind of video.
Mat says garchomp Shows a gabite
Hoi
Can you do a meat substitutes test?
Some Pokémon are ok to eat. Miltank, yeah I get that. Lovely beef. Maybe avoid Applin, try Sitrus berries instead since they’re much less… Worm filled.
last
Plants have Protein too you know. 😡
3 words  Jelly  Filled  Donuts
So we're just gonna eat a literal teacup
Nooooo, I’ll never eat my magicarp no matter how juicy it looks……..
I don’t mind ate nurse Joy.
In Soviet Russia: Pokémon eat You.
Who would've known, an apple is edible!
Applins don’t
7:38 ah yes, garchomp and not gabite
noo not top comint
Garchomp.. shows gabite
That’s Gabite not garchomp
Love me some gooooooood sushi
896
👁👄👁
I don’t like the title 😭
If pokemon was real I would go Vegan!
Man can't believe he didnt talk about "Bad Eggs"
So should we eat Nurse Joy?
Fun fact, no one has watched the full vid yet
i think im safe this time
Great theory, But applin isn't even an apple the worm inside is the pokemon
No, you shouldn't.
love how he said garchomp and put gabite
Is this a game theory?
Already so many comments
Another childhood ruined
What?!??!? But yes they actually do that in Pokémon
I got the notification for this channel and read the title. And had to sit for a minute to process the title. 😹
Pokémon gotta eat em all….?
Would legendary Pokémon and mythical taste better?
Every part of this is wrong
Lillie: “You are what you eat, what think I’m called Warm Lillie?”
Hey matpat on jacksepticeye's channel  he is doing #thankmas and I think it would be great if you could contribute this year (more info on his new video).
I mean I bet they taste good
Yum
Yes, nurse Joy is a pokemon. Also matpat: Yes, you should eat your pokemon.  🤔😏
*n o*
You’re officially a monster
Furries: "This information will prove to be *very useful* "
The tastiest pokemon is Togepi.
I wanna be the very best like no one ever was…. To catch was a real test, so I gave up and rest my gaaaaaaaaame  POKÉMON I CANT CATCH EM not you and me POKÉMON GIVES ANXIETY POKÉMON  OHHHHHHH I HAVE NO FRIENDS  in this world I want to ENNNNNNND
Plot twist someone eats a zuzubat and there’s covid in Pokémon
Wait what is all the food that the people in the Pokémon anime made of (gasp) ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE POKÉMON ANIME  EAT POKÉMON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(faint)
is matpad ok?, the title concern me
Then again pokemon make up a lot of plants and all the meats we would need to survive
Bro if That Vegan Teacher were to click on this vid she would die lol.
Ahh more videos on matpat ruining my childhood
What to watch tow video of the some time
To be honest I would eat magikarp
No, i don't think i will
Please theorize if pancakes can be used as plates (American Dad)
Might as well. GameFreak doesn't want to do anything with them. #BringBackNationalDex
hi
nice
Is it only me that thinks Pikachu would taste like ketchup and mustard mixed up?
Yeah Matpat, I'll eat my Chandelure
I remember Polygon made a video about the tastiest pokemon lol and every edible pokemon
Finally a real answer I’ve been thinking about this for five years
BDG also covered pokémon edibility and that didnt work out so good...
Better than SnackWorld, at least.
NO ÒwÓ
Delicious
2 Pokemon theories is exactly what I needed today. Thanks :)
Hello from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
MATPAT PLEASE
don't make me unsub.
meet ditto, the pokemon that can shapeshift into any food you want!
First yes
This title coupled with the Game theory one is concerning
Matpat you’ve ruined my childhood enough
Hmm...We should eat pokemon....Not so sure that is a good idea, especially if you're wanting to have a Torchic sandwich https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHJDelljD-M
Christian has an answered I was thinking it up for five years
yummy in my tummy yum yum yum sounds good
w h y
The WHAT
when  a kid see the new serie  and one of this episode will have someone eat a pokemon
Hi
Matpat please
1:02 alcremie i can comfirm from personal experiance
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Ash now looks kinda sus
I’ve pulled 2 Gold Mew’s from the Celebrations set
Peapole eating fish:im okay whit it Peapole knowing majikarps in the pokemon universe are eaten: how cruel :'c
MATPAT DONT EAT MY POKEMON
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
I've seen a few Pokemon timelines now but think no one quite got it right
Ah yes. Just like uncle Wrex said.
This and the game theory upload seems a bit sussy
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
This gives a new meaning to Pokémon Café
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Everytime Mat says Kanto, part of my soul dies...
Well would it be considered  Vegan if you ate Pokemon they are not technically animals tbh.
There have actually been times where magicarp sushi was mentioned in the show.  They REALLY didn't try to hide it.
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
please make a video about how many calories monsters are. example: stay puft marshmallow man.
YUMMIE
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Matpat please
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Nice
No one has seen this entire video yet lol
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
I’m sure there’s some alternative to Pokémon protein… I hope so at least.
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
I'll stick to berries thank you very much (sees current price) On second thought, cheap pork isn't bad and I'm technically an omnivore
Matpat please don’t eat my pokemon
hi
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Me when I wake up: let's see what food theory cooked up this time. yes you should eat your Pokemon. Me: ...😅 Oh matpat you never fair to surprise me!😂
*Food theory AND game theory about pokemon releases at the same time* HOW AM I GOING TO CHOOSE-
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
I can’t believe im here
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Literally like a minute before I got the notification for this video I put Pokemon snap in my switch coincidence yes but a funny one
I’ve always wanted to eat a Pokémon they look delicious.
Wow Matt Pat is back and his fans got to catch em all(all as in his videos)
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
That pokemon fan: Eating pokemon is wrong, food theory, hurting pokemon is wrong food theory, share this song!    Vegan donut.
Probably the worst video made on this channel.
GT and FT releasing pokemon episodes at the same time Verified youtubers: it's my  time to  ✨s h i n e ✨
is corenflex asoup
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
It’s canon?!
waw
Ok this deserves a thumbs down
can't believe im in the first 1000 comments
Pokemon contain meat, meat contains protein  Lesson learned: Gym guys secretly eat pokemon.
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Im extremely early lol
I just got a notification for this and - I kid you not - I started crying. I'm not consciously sad about it, but tears started rolling down my cheeks as soon as I saw the title and thumbnail
pov: you're early and have nothing to say
Pokemon gotta eat em all
Matpat please tell me this isn’t canon
Why not just eat other peoples pokemon
So there was a kfc week then cannibal week and now pokemon week
Okay I haven't seen the video yet but I predict he's going to bring up slowpoke tails
Just as you said that the nurse or whatever was secretly a Pokémon, you uploaded the video and it popped up over the video!
I’m sacred o-o
Hi
Hello there food theory comrade lovely video keep it up bro I luv this channel Nice work comrade lovely video keep it up bro.
Wait, this is food theory right?
These intros are just getting more scary😟
Me looking at my notifications oh so I’m going to eat nurse joy?
2 mins... wow!
Based on your upload names you suggest we eat nurse joy
No title intro song anymore…… it’s happening to this channel too, fellas 😔
When he talked about The nurse joy video on game theory..  It popped in my notifications... huh
I love your videos but WHAT!
😭😨 Matpat please
Do a video of the lore of the goes wrong show   My personal theory is that Trevor was behind everything
0 comments gang
Right when you told us about the game theory video about nurse joy being a Pokémon I got a notification on that video when it just came out
So you’re saying you should eat nurse joy
This got my attention so fastt
this is a dark video
MatPat ruining our childhoods once more
The second he said game theory the game theory episode popped up in my notifications.
The intro to this video is cursed. Send help.
So this a food theory, game theory???
First
HAHAHAHHAA! I just got notified about the Nurse Joy theory just as he talked about it.
Pokemon themed theory day? Just what I ordered! 🤣
I cant
33th
When he mentioned the new game theory episode it came up on my notifications, where are the cameras?!
Banana cream cheese
petetion to make theory’os real
The title doesn't shock me anymore. All I thought was, "I should eat my Pokemon? Okay, MatPat, tell me why."
Hi
When he said nurse joy is a Pokémon, that’s when my notification for that video went off 🤭
It happened in the Animé to Magikarp... poor uncapable thing!
MatPat: *(talks about the Nurse Joy video)* Notification: appears WITCHCRAFT!!!
Early
I like how well it was timed for me, the moment he mentioned the nurse joy episode, the notification for it appeared. Granted I clicked on the video as soon as I saw it.
As I first clicked on the video, the nurse not video was uploaded when it was mentioned in the video, either a genius move or a hilarious coincidence
Hey, Matthew. I have a theory for you. The scientific reason why the first pancake always goes bad.
Peta has a bone to pick with you.
When I saw this my mind went  ??? Also as soon as you said nurse joy was a Pokémon that video popped up from my notifications
I got the notification for the Game Theory episode the moment he mentioned it in the video😂😂😂
Lmao why was my reaction to seeing that notification “wtf”
Matpat... Are you okay?
What
The fact the notification for game theory as soon as he said it
Title: Yes, you should eat your pokemon   Me: What the actual *censored* is wrong with you?!  Pokemon are suppose to be your companions.  Not your food!  What if they end up eating us, instead?!
so we should eat nurse joy?
Hello there
I miss bdg’s video game mental break downs.
Wow matpat posted 2 Pokémon videos in 1 second
I literally said "but that's just a theory. A Film theory aaaand cut." As a joke and then I got this notification
Paimon shall be a Pokémon now-   Our emergency food :D
OMG I LOVE UR VIDS
Triple upload matpat?
When he mentioned nurse joy being a Pokémon I got the notification of nurse joy being a Pokémon. Coincidence?
i have lost faith in mat
Yo! Matpat collab with Matpat. Dude, I never thought those two would EVER work on a video together.
welp here we go again
There is a cow pokemon wich migt be used as food
in terms of human meal consumption and pokemon nutrition, vaporeon is the most... tasty!
I got the game theory notification  right when you mentioned it
Hahaha 0:44 i got the notification of the video exactly when he talked about it .
2,900TH
food theory and game theory just uploaded within seconds of each other with videos both about pokemon 😳
hi
I could really go for a miltank burger rn
as it talks about nurse joy being a pokémon, i got the notification for it.
Post part two of omega mart 🙏
What happened to the intro?
i feel like japan already has pokémon ramen, solely because it’s japan
No, as there's non magical animals in the Pokemon verse
POKÈMON
Pokémon are scientifically better deep fired
when i saw this notification pop up on my phone, i slowly turned to my brother and said “broski… matpat’s officially gone crazy”
Im concerned how you go from eating pokemon to calling the pokemon nurse a pokemon
Early gang, 1 minute ago
At first I read the title Yes you should eat your pants! Because I didn't read the title all the way through before clicking the video
When you Said we should Watch the video from game theory I immediately got a notification from it
early gang
Some Pokemon are magically delicious.
Okay this is cool, as soon as you said nurse joy is a pokemon, I GOT THE NOTIFICATION.
Wait... What now?
I got this notification when I was in the middle of playing pokemon blue on my TI-84 CE plus python calculator.
Is this game theory or food theory?
Matpat 😰
Do Pokemon restraunts get Michelin Staryus?
Legit no one here has finished the video yet
I always wondered what various Pokémon tasted like
wow just wow
It was timed perfectly that I got the notification on the nurse joy was a Pokémon exactly when he said it
First 😘🥰🥰✨✨✨😍 cool video bro
As soon as he was talking about nurse joy I got a notification for the video XD
I mean you shouldnt force your dog to be vegan.
Yummi pokemon
*congratulations to everyone who are early and found this comment 👏*
Technicallly, this is a film theory, food theory, and game theory, therefore, you should post it on all there 😈 I can't spell
0:44 perfect timing i got the notification about nurse joy
Eat the Pokémon
They begging was wierd
Early!
I was watching “Try Not to Say Hol’ Up” and then this happened…
Hold up… why is this a food theory?! Wait! Is this a crossover again?

I 100% agree with this
Help me
MAT PAT STOPP

Remember to claim your free zarude and shiny celebi. You will have gotten a code if you have signed up for the pokemons newsletter

Bro released the vids one after another like this
Game theory: You should eat your pokemon  Me to my Yamask: *Cannibalism initiated*
Hello
That pikachu looking real tasty
It’s 11 36 in 🇮🇳
Hello! I loved the video! ❤️
WHY
Ruining your childhood is our motto and main income! - Food/Film/Game theory
Fun fact: When the Pokémon anime first aired in the 90’s, it was only planned as a one-off series to promote the game. However, it proved surprisingly popular, and there have been over 20 series and 23 films! It’s also currently one of the longest running anime series ever!
Not the apple.
Me watching this while playing Pokémon X: 👁️👄👁️
I am suprised that matpat got something wrong in the intro
*I Love It When The Notification Comes, "Someone Has Subscribed Your Channel" 😭 "Someone Has Liked Your Comment" It Always Makes My Day!😇*
Mat: People call me the food theorist  Everyone: No Mat that is not what you're known for
Yooo this is dark 😲
You’ve ruined my happiness enough
You cant eat applin it's the green worm thing inside not the apple
Woah, this video makes sense but uh, was unexpected to say the least!!
I was just chilling in my room, having a good day, and suddenly I saw "YES! you should eat your pokemon"
Thanks Matt for the awesome content please keep it up!
Didn't know I needed to see this today, but I'm happy I did.
Pokémon themed week I see
