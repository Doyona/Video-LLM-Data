Can we please promote 'Intern' Brandon?
Umm can we get Taylor on the pod
Sausage egg mcmuffin is also my favorite Jason LOL
59:42 you're welcome
love watching you guys but sorry not to much anymore to much potty mouth but i still love you guys
So underhanded being disrespectful to Taylor and others. This man has already said he likes to be protective.    Well they played petty games and won petty prizes.
YAHHHHH IM ON FIRE YAH😂
Daniel Arms of Arms Family on YouTube has named his new dog Kelce.
Fries and hash browns may not be the best bang for your buck but it is the perfect side car for the sandwich.
McDonald's has the best fountain Coke cuz it's made special for McDonald's and it has more syrup... It's great...
Wait the Indians and browns used to share a stadium??? I’m elder millennial (grad HS in 1999) and I bet knew that but I knew they filmed major league about the Cleveland Indians at Milwaukee county stadium (I grew up up in Green Bay)
You guy’s big brother and little brother getting long so well .
Rewatching this after SB LVIII and booooy  did  TK made it up for Mecole. So happy Mecole got the SB TD!
Just let Kylie get a cat, it's a scientific fact that cats remove any negative energy from a room, plus you don't have to walk them
Breaking down football for swifties. Welcome to football. We're stoked to have you.   1) A FG is a kick through the upright goal posts, usually on fourth down (fourth try to get ten yards before the defense gets the ball back) and the farthest FG ever hit was done by Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker at 66 yards.   2) Travis blocks and catches the ball. Hes basically a big hybrid Wide Receiver. If the Quarterback is handing the ball to the Runningback on a run play, Travis would block defenders trying to get to whoever has the ball on offense. The guy giving the ball to the QB on every snap (play/down/offensive snap) is the center (of the O Line, and that's the position Jason plays)  3. A down is one of four tries to get ten yards. Usually if the offense doesnt get ten yards in three tries they either attempt a field goal if theyre <60 yards from the goal post/uprights. If they are farther than that the punter comes in and kicks the ball to a punt returner who decides where his teams offense will take over. If the punting/kicking team misses, or fails when trying to get the last little bit of yards necessary to get a new set of downs, it is called a turniver on downs and the other teams offense takes the ball and tries to move it the other way into their end zone for a TD.   4. You can follow it on the NFL app or any of the other sports websites. Just google your team and put scores and/or play by play and you should find a good option. NFL games are on Thursday nights, Monday nights, and all day Sunday (usually). There are also usually three games on Thanksgiving. College Football is on Saturdays. Fox, CBS, NBC.  5. Tight End has become like a hybrid wide receiver. Big, fast, tall guys that can out muscle and out jump smaller, faster Defensive Backs, and LineBackers. They block (help the Offensive Line) on Running plays. Great targets for within twenty yards of the end zone (known as the Red Zone)  6. Corner backs usually follow receivers or stay closer to the Front 7 (D Line, and Linebackers) to assist in tackling ballcarriers close to the line of scrimmage. Safeties are essentially a safety blanket for the defense. They can come up and help in the run game but that leaves the dedense vulnerable to deep routes by the WRs, or less TD prevention of the ball carrier gets past the front 7 of the defense.  Honorable Mentions:  1) a Field Goal is worth three points. A Touchdown is worth six (and get a shot at an extra point, short field goal, or go for a two point conversion)  2) the defense can also get the ball an interception (they catch the pass from the opposing offense, usually the QB) or a fumble (when the ballcarrier loses the ball and the defense gets it)   3) Regular penalties youll see the refs call (and you'll learn to despise them and blame your teams inadequacies on them):  a) Pass Interference: Can go on offense or defense. Usually goes on defense on a CB/DB. It's when (>5 yards from the LoS) when they stop the WR from having a fair shot at the catch (early tackle, not playing the ball), and offensive pass interference doesnt happen as often but its when the WR stops the DB from making a play on a bad throw/potential Interception before the ball gets there.   b) Holding: Holding an opponents jersey to stop them from advancing towards the QB or through a block on the DL (usually happens on the OL)  c) False Start: offensive line moves before the ball is snapped after everyone is set.   Happens to the defense too but is usually called encroachment or neutral zone infraction if they cross the line of scrimmage.    4) On offense a player is down when a limb other than their hand, head, or foot touch the ground with the ball. Usually a leg, knee, shoulder, or elbow. If the ballcarrier falls down they can get up and run again unless the oposing team touches them down.   Also, forgot to add that Defensive Pass Interference is a spot foul which is HUGE for the offense because if the QB hurls the ball 50 yards to his WR/TE/RB and DPI is called it's the same as a huge completion and the ball moves to wear the foul occured. It usually happens more than 10 yards down the field which usually leads to a new set of downs for the offense. Not necessarily fair considering OPI is a ten yard penalty but the new age of NFL rules favors the offense.  Also, a caveat to the last thing I mentioned, if the ball carrier looks like he's down but doesn't hear a whistle and is on top of a defender that's on the ground the play is still live as long as his knee/elbow/shoulder/back doesn't touch the ground while he has possession of the ball. If you see players stop because they think the ball carrier is down but the whistle hasn't been blown the ball carrier can keep going for the TD.  I'm a Seahawks fan that fell in love with the game of football after our SB run in 2005 where the refs stole the ring from us and gave it to Pittsburgh as a going away/retiring present for Jerome Bettis. Yes I'm still salty about it. My team went 13-3 and had the league MVP at RB and lost to a 11-5 Pittsburgh team that lost their way to a SB. #GoHawks  My wife is a Swifty and I'm excited to be able to talk to her about football and see her get into it now too. Especially since it's not the f***in Kardashians or something like that. I say the NFL is my soaps and I'm not even exaggerating a little bit.   Welcome to the game we know and love dearly,  -Sven
The McDonald's conversation and the accidental soda really gave me Tenacious D- drive thru diet coke vibes. Hilarious
As a Bills fan, I have nothing but respect for the Kelce bros. “Nothing but love”🫶
wild cherry Pepsi is the best
I eat and love the same breakfast sandwich as well I eat two of them every time but I’m a fatty
Travis is such a scumbag for pushing Coach Reed at the Super Bowl. He needs to be reprimanded for that.
B.S. Kylie for 1st lady! 😂
Jason and his wife, Kylie are hilarious.  ❤
Jason is such a great Big bro. You can tell that even though Travis can be a handful 😂 the two of them are inseparable! Come to think of it, Jason is a madman too 🤣 #LFG
Lmmfao. !!!! Did Taylor give him permission to go on YouTube  ? I can't wait for her new song dissing him after the swift bowl..
Yes Travis!!! Cherry Pepsi is the BEST!!
You NEED to tailgate at Lambeau. Promise you it’s the best💚
NEW  NEWWWWWS OH IM SORRY IVE BEEN DOWN  AND OUT.
Kelce brothers I love you guys!! Go Chiefs!❤💛
Combo is my new favorite word LOL @ 11:00
Travis always quoting some of my fave movies
When Travis noticed his armpits I laughed so fuckin' hard for a good ten minutes! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
All I think about when I watch famous celebrities like this, the only thing I can think of is how $50,000 would literally change my whole life, and these guys make 240 times that, or more and it sucks but they work so hard and should be paid for that tough work, however it’s a little fucking crazy in the same breath.
Lol
Steak egg and cheese bagel was the mvp
Please don't ever jump on a table. Injury city. So much drinking - will be glad when that slows down...to a stop. But love the Kelce brothers. Lake Erie yeah!
*Travis and Jason arguing over why travis's pits are leaking....*  Travis cracks his 9th can of excilerator and still neither know why😂
Jason and Travis,  For your podcast  Football first. I am trying to send you a photo from my yearbook (1966) showing tight end #86 (me) walking off the football field hand-in-hand with my high school sweetheart.  A familiar theme!  And I’d also like to send you two short videos of ice sculptures I carved at Winter Festivals out here in Western Massachusetts over the past two weeks. I carved a sculpture of the Swiftie Hand-Gesture-of-Love, made from two large 300lb blocks of crystal-clear ice,  to help spread the love. My sculpture made the front page of the Greenfield Recorder (Greenfield Massachusetts) today  Travis, Good luck in the Super Bowl!  Happy Valentine’s Day!  If you are interested, let me know how to send the photo and videos.  Peter V
Ima big fan bro🎉
McD's Orange Hi-C is the only thing better than a fountain Coke - and hashbrowns 🥴
TRAVIS TRY GILLETTE CELL OVER 24 HR PROTECTION YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE GO GET IT AN ITS FOR MEN BUT I USE THE MENS ITS JUST BETTER I SWEAT GIRLS STUFF NEVER HOLD UP BUT THIS DID TRYED ALOT NEVER TRYING ANYTHING ELSE WORKS I PUT IT ON AFTER SHOWER

I'm with Jason on the combo thing. I don't do combos
Why does travis have the best radio voice 😂
Love you guys, never stop
Jason getting the surprise coke but who go his iced black coffee expecting a coke!?🤣😬
#traviskelsey I heard u knelt when they played the national anthem is this true can I have ur thoughts of why u did
These guys need to have Joe Staley on. Literally the funniest guy the nfl has ever seen.
Sausage egg and cheese McMuffin is what I get too. But I do the combo. HAHA!!
I have been on fire twice, In my youth. For some reason. Your first instinct is to run.
Pepsi sucks! Ice cold Coke a cola.  Coke has a special deal with McDonald's. Their coke bottles are delivered cold and they have a special ratio of ice to cola, that makes it so Good! pepsi is a wannabe brand that spends a ton of money to be second best!
Etsy for all the Swifties! A whole new stream of advertisers for New Heights!
Travis is a douche
This is the first time i watched this pod cast and As a die hard bills fan, I hated Travis on the field but I have to admit after listening to him and the real respect he has for the bills and other teams he li es up against,  it's hard not to like him. Shit , I might even hit Spotify and download Taylor swift song. ( Naaaahhh). Jason , you're a straight up F-ing legend in Buffalo NY brother. I hope you guys come back during the off season and kick it in our city.
the way trav says “ooooo” when talking about soda is hilarious
Jason Kelce you rock!!! We all need to be more like you.
Travis is right , J. KELCE  FOR PRESENT.not that Kylie will ever wish for her family.. but ud WIN
I can't even explain how much I enjoy this podcast ❤. I just discovered you all today (had no idea until today). I am the youngest of 3, two older brothers who played football. Since they have been done, I have not liked football or watched bc it consumed my life and it became my identity Two things. #1 you two have made me care about football again. #2 my daughter still plays hockey with the boys and Taylor Swift has recently been an inspiration. Two fold. Thank you for being simply normal, fun, good men who cry and share. Thank you to Taylor for being the piece that brings inspiration as well. Keep on keeping on. Good character + strong athletes. What I'm trying to teach my two teenagers. Thank you for being YOU 💪✌️
Wild cherry Pepsi is the best! Even the wild cherry Pepsi zero. Can’t tell the difference. There is NOTHING like a McDonald’s fountain soda. Never has been.
I’m a Bills Fan from upstate New York  💙❤️🦬  Love your guys podcast! Rooting for Chiefs in the Super Bowl 💪🏽💪🏽
Doesn’t anyone else see how ridiculous it is that two multi millionaire professional athletes are shilling for advertisers on their dumb podcast?!?! Travis must of learned from TayTay on how to scam your fans out of every cent possible.
Totally agree.  Sausage, egg and cheese mc muffin is the best!
The cookie cake was drawn free hand. The designer is now experiencing people copying the image and claiming it as their own. Can you guys help her?
Jason your a great man
TRAVIS PLEASE STOP WITH THE F WORD SOOO VERY MUCH. love you to pieces, but kids really look up to you and JASON. ❤
The thing I loved about Jason's viral moment was: in what other context does a large, drunk, shirtless, bearded man crawl through a window and pick up your little girl and not only are you not worried about it, you're ecstatic and taking video? 🤣🤣 Epic moment.
16:44 Who’s Brandon?
"Holy fucking nice".....Travis Kelce
Washington fan here, I hate our name. 🥲
❤🎉
You guys are the best teammates!
You guys rock and enjoy your content.
You guys are the best people,  you were raised by legends!  Good people attract good people,  and on the flip side,  I've become  bigger Taylor Swift fan thanks to y'all.  And it turns out,  another amazing person,  who was also raised by legends.  Bless y'all!
Jason is totally right about combos!! Fries and Coke are unhealthy and cost nothing…. Just buy 2 burgers!!
Cleveland native here! Moved around a lot growing up but if I have any roots, it’s THE LAND! Grew up on Cleveland sports and no matter where I have lived in the world I’ll always be a loyal Browns Guardians Cavs fan. I love tuning in to the pod to hear you talk about Cleveland moments in history. In this episode it made me laugh out loud to hear you mention Ten Cent Beer Night 1974 Cleveland Indians vs Texas Rangers. If you ever have a free moment in your chaotic schedules give a listen to 2 comedians who do an incredible telling of this event. The Dollop with Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds. Highly recommend.   Unrelated but I am currently road tripping around New Zealand and New Heights is on in the van any time I have a long drive day! So much respect for you guys.   All my love to THE LAND from New Zealand
YouTube picked some of Taylor’s old videos for me to watch recently. One of the comments that stuck out to me was about her feeling she had to be perfect, and really feeling the negative comments. It reminded me a bit of a comment that Kylie made during her episode. She lamented a bit the idea of the kids going to preschool and teaching the other kids some of the four letter words heard at home. She commented that she was happy that Jason’s language was notorious, so she could hide behind him.   I think that is secretly why Taylor liked Jason in the afc championship suite. It keeps her off the hook. 😉
You guys are classy. Can Tony Gonzalez get some love?
2:29 Wait who posted? The NFL Twitter?
59:51 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need Jason in KC next year with Travis to finish out the career
Jason Kelce for President!!! We loved having you in Buffalo!!
Travis sweating his pits out in a t-shirt then changes to a sweatshirt. Never a dull moment. Love this podcast.
Travis is 100% correct that hashbrowns may be the best item on McD’s menu.
Pfizer boy. This guy picks on the kicker because that's all he can handle. Myocarditis kid.
I love how they allowed us into their lives
"Look like two big Chrismith hams." - Chris Jones, The Ladies Man
I'm still a cowboys girl. I love y'all. Y'all are so funny. My 2nd team is the chiefs
Loved hearing about Jason's version.   I couldn't stop laughing.
How do I get in touch with you guys?
Travis..
Oh damn, I am watching this on 1/30 and today I received an email explaining why McDonald's coke is the best. It is shipped to stores in metal barrels not plastic bags, the machines are cleaned with purified water and the mix is with purified water, and then the straws are wider than other stores so the Coke bubbles don't burst before hitting your tongue. I have even converted my daughter, Coke in a can or from McDonald's. Enjoy!
Dude, I love Wild cherry Pepsi and I love sausage, egg, and cheese McMuffin from McDonald’s we could be friends guys
Jason is such a great story teller, lol. How he described drinking the coke thinking it was ice coffee was hilarious.
Love these guys 🙌🏼🔥
Hella nice vibrato there Travis! 🎵
Indianapolis here! We sell the aluminum bottles and cans at our games. The bottle sale ending must have been a Cincy thing!!!! We can't have the bottle caps to any bottle coke or alcohol because those hurt less than a whole bottle I guess 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Questionor forecast: so one more year of football then stay at home dad with you and Taylor’s babies!!! They would be cute?
Not ok: Taylor Swift cheering for her man & team. Ok: shirtless Jason's antics during the game. Double standard. ☹️
Travis throwing Ravens' player's equipment was assholic & unsportsmanlike. Kinda like his opinion of the Eagles.
As a power builder I 100% agree people are not training hard enough usually. Number 1 reason they don’t see progress! Keep it up!
i love Jason, dude is goals.
HANDS DOWN!!  McDonalds fountain coke is the best!
From Buffalo but I’m a proud member of the Kingdom and was lucky enough to be at the game❤️💛
@Kylie, my 88 yo MIL broke her foot and will be in rehab and has a pregnant cat named Boomer. She needs a good forever home. Just throwing it out there. Sadly, I’m extremely allergic to cats.
Miss Pfizer Bud Light, how is your husband Taylor Swift? Done with this show. The first year was fun, but it's all been ruined by Travis selling out to Pfizer. Ruined.
You lost me at "I like McDonald's coffee"
Wild cherry Pepsi at the movie theater is THE best! It's the only time I drink it. Just hits differently!!!😂❤❤
Travis kalce is going to be used to promote Biden watch
Watch the chiefs win the super bowl and then Travis and swift endorse dip shit Biden
This is a bit deep, but I want to thank you guys for showing what positive masculinity can look like. I help develop guys into men and we all take from role models. (I would love to know your mosaic role models) We all have our skills, strengths, weaknesses and mistakes. We all have our doubts but show up for the moment. Being a man is knowing it and taking responsibility while still using the drive to be there at the moment based on principle.  Thank you guys for helping me find my voice for my guys to help them be great in life. They are pounded by ridiculous messages of alpha male stuff. You have given us the real world antidote. Please don’t feel responsible… just thank you for being you.
LMAO 🤣🤣 @13:50 My aunt is named Theresa, and one of my best buds growing up reminds me so much of Travis it's insane.  Tight end, not great with grammar, the whole works.  He started calling her T-Cup and 15 years later I still call her that
Jason should play at least one more year for the Chiefs. Make it happen
We need the shirtless Jason Kelce as a Chiefs Fan in Buffalo bobblehead.  Fundraiser for Charity @NewHeights???  Who's with me?
The question we are all wondering:Will Taylor come on the podcast? we all want it
As a die hard Dallas fan I must say you Jason are the ONLY acceptable Eagle. You're personality is amazing. Travis, you are the only reason I don't completely destroy my son(all in good fun) for being a Chiefs fan. Y'all are hilarious thanks for being you.
#NoDumbQuestions do you ship merch worldwide or what? 😉🇮🇹
💯 Wild Cherry Pepsi Trav!!🍒
You switched up and are supporting the demonic side of life. Believe it or not but your gf is in bed with soros. I’ve lost all respect for you. Clout chasing for the bag. How can u be respected again? Idk MAYBE LEAVE HER BEFORE YOUR SOUL IS AT STAKE
Travis, you and kermit should be completely ashamed of yourselves. Throwing a well respected kickers things around like 4 year olds. Kids are watching that. Shame on you. Your ego has taken over all of you. Jason, you are an amazing human being… keep being you
One of your dogs is sleeping on your sofa behind you, Jason…😆🤣😂😆🤣😂😆🥰
Y’all should do a podcast w/ Brian Shaw and Eddie Hall👀 I feel like it would be amazing
Hey Travis, you're a great player. How come you acted like such a douche during the Ravens game? Good job avoiding the 3 personal foul penalties you should have gotten before Van Noy hit you.
Travis how much money did they pay for your soul (George soros)
Why did Travis and Patrick throw out Justin Tucker’s equipment? Was that a joke?
When you look up tight end on Wikipedia.... Travis kelce is literally the picture they show you
#nodumbquestions  Recently my work partner pulled a Ravens prank on me and posted Ravens stuff all over my desk at work. I had to 1 up him and decked his out w KC pics & streamers everywhere. Even in the work fridge.😂 What was your best prank on someone you ever pulled? Wish i could have attached a pic so you guys could have a good laugh. P.S. my 9yr old daughter Bristol loves you guys. We have do family football time watching you guys play.  🎉-Biggest fans- The Logan gals from Texas
Hi Jason! I’m Kelly and I’m from OHIO just like you, I am doing Super Bowl squares to benefit Brookfield Ohio youth wrestling program! I hoping you would want to buy a squares for the Super Bowl ( go chiefs) we are trying to buy new mats for our wrestlers. Our Venmo is FOBW-2022 this is a legit request and we would appreciate any help!!
The brow brothers
I'm a born-and-bred diehard Buffalo Bills fan. Bills Mafia is a fierce and loyal fan base. I am a Kelce fan! Both Jason and Travis. You boys are a class act. Thank you for your kind comments on Buffalo and our JA #17! ❤ Also, shout out to Pacheco for helping me win my fantasy football league!! WHAHOO!
I just curious does Jason ever order the mcgriddle style carb for dollar
I could watch y'all 24/7...

Jason should go to the Billls
My wife is a huge fan Angiefalcon
I saw the video of you guys after the game blasting the F-bombs and GD. Stay classy.
I just wanted to say I seriously think ye are absolutely fantastic.You bring so much joy to so many. I wish ye nothing but good health and as much joy as you bring to us.  Ye deserve nothing but the best life can bring. Plus I'm just love seeing How happy Travis and Taylor are together ❤️  blessing to all the kelce family. from  🇮🇪 😊 p.s honeymoon in Ireland please😉
Tailgate Tour is a tv show pilot idea Travis!
Watching these boys here are hilarious and watching the on the field is amazing!!! I'll take a Jason Kelce jersey and I'll take a Travis jersey with Travis in it!!!😊
Thank you, guys, for this show.  Kylie you must get some DALESSANDRO'S STEAKS AND HOAGIES with the BEER for Jason after you get home. Jason hope you do not retire but if you do I will miss you every week when watching the EAGLES Play.  Best of Luck in the future.  Travis you are the best TE ever and keep up the records man.  Love it!
Am I the only one that sits at my office desk and claps with, "LET'S GO, SPORTS BAR"!? Surely not, right??
Guys guys guys 1st watching  brilliant fun have been watching both on the field ....whats to say but you are so entertaining  and real. Wish you continued success. When u both retire  i hope you do pre and post game shows the network shows  dont sing genuine  thx for this  cheers,
You guys should definitely tailgate at every stadium! Cheifs going to the superbowl!!
TRAVIS NUMBER 1 FAN HERE FROM PHILIPPINES......HOPE U AND TAYLOR GET MARRIED SOON...!!!!
I am raising the next Kelce brothers. Colton is the tight end 2.5 years older than his brother who is 120 and playing on the line. Colton will be just like Jason keeping Caleb out of jail or trouble.
Jason next time you need to truffle shuffle
McDonalds coke is the best because it comes in a  canister instead of a bag
Travis Kelce might be the biggest piece of shit in the NFL, mahomes is a close second
We need a tv show or a series of Trav and Jason tailgating at every stadium in the NFL, with a special guest each episode who’s a big time supporter of the team.
Travis sweats through a shirt but puts a hoodie on ?🤣🤣
I am win lose or tie fan till I die COWBOYS fan! But yall are the best and the brotherly love yall have for each other is just amazing!!
Get him to do coach tomlin walking away from the press conference after the loss to the bills 😂😂😂 side note i am a steelers fan , but i love you kelce brothers

Love Jason but absolutely can’t stand how fake Travis is. So god damn fake bro ur a sad individual
Love Taylor and Travis together and and and loves the cistern law and Jason the brother and the two parents
YAY Heights. I'm also an alum.
hey travis! on the next episode of the podcast would love for you to discuss throwing justin tuckers helmet and all of your uncalled taunting to the ravens!!
Travis !!  Have them build you a special nut cup for the Super Bowl with a pocket for the engagement ring, if you win.. pull that bad boy out *que * Sparks Fly
Woohoo! Way to go, Chiefs!  Headed back to another Super Bowl! 🎉🎉🎉
Hyperhydrosis(profuse sweating) is a side effect of head injuries, I had it from high-school football. Sucks.
I used to be a fan, but after seen the way the nfl has make travis a diva, letting he do whatever he wants on the field is too much
Jason, I think you and Travis are both fabulous, and hysterical, of course. But I feel like you owe both Travis and Taylor a selfless do-over for this show.   Yes, it was funny. But the spotlight should have been on Travis. His team won a very important game, he was a big reason for that, and the Chief’s offense played better than “pretty well.” You gave him very little recognition - rather, you stole the spotlight, and made the show about you. You also went on and on, and on again, about how much you love the Bills, how much they love you, what a great time you had with them, etc., etc. Not sure you ever did say you were so glad to watch him, and the whole Chiefs team, play in such an important game. Of course, Travis had no choice but to laugh-along, and he did. But he shouldn’t have had to. Jealousy does not look good on you - and it is so unfair to your brother (he is, after all, your brother - and is also an amazing player).   Then Travis shared with you (and a ton of people watching) a compliment that Taylor gave you. You didn’t even acknowledge that - but for a little chuckle before you launched back into your diatribe about yourself. Obstinacy also does not look good on you. Just say something nice. It’s such an easy thing to do.   Again, the show was funny, but I couldn’t help but feel bad for Travis (and Taylor). They really do deserve a selfless do-over.   Watch the video.
Why does Travis act like a little baby on the field?
Too bad Trav's team doesn't have the tush push! Huh Jason? Lol
Im a broncos fan but I like kelce but you gotta explain now what u did to Justin tucker seemed messed up to me
I think your 2 are adorable BUT as a die hard Baltimore and especially Justin Tucker fan, I lost some respect points for Travis throwing his stuff around. Not classy.
What happens when you throw a football, after a touchdown, as a gift to the fans?  Does management charge you?  Does the NFL say “No” and fine you or is it OK?  thanks🌷Lynn
‪Why were you guys rude to Justin Tucker??? Very disappointing! He’s a great kicker and fellow longhorn. Go Ravens!‬
Travis says to many F bombs in every sentence. Can you use that language for the locker rooms .  Love you guys , will be watching the game Sunday. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️ Jason you seem to be a wonderful older brother
Jason:  “Pop. That’s right, pop. 😉”   Yes. 🍁
I want Travis to get married just so we can see Jason's wedding party antics and best man speech
I've been watching you guys daily over the past few weeks.  It feels like you are my brothers from another mother.   THANK YOU FOR PROUDLY REPRESENTING CLEVELAND!!  stay safe keep up the great work!
I could not get it to paste the link here, but have you seen the picture of Jason as King Kong on the Empire State building?
most stadiums when they sell you the "bottle" don't give you the cap anymore so fans can no longer hurl full bottles of liquid at people an empty water bottle hurts a lot less than a full one.
The Kelce brothers are so down to earth and great role models of being good to others.
I don't even watch sport but these dudes are hilarious and fun to listen to.
Lots of integrity for Travis to call himself out on the fumble at the end zone.
Next year you need a show called the jason Tailgate show as you crash every teams tailgate.
Hey Jason how big are those dogs you have? Those are some Massive dog bowls behind you 😂
https://youtu.be/0xC6_0shP9M?si=YNC0GaCcEyPq_NDB
Are you guys in the playoffs
I'm originally from Harlan KY, now in Fayetteville NC. I love Cincinnati Ohio because of Grippo's chips. The gourmet bbq chips
Jason does realize 92% of the time ordering an item that can be included in a combo is cheaper in a combo everytime.
Remember when that 17 year old beat up katt😂
"the wind" the flag wasn't even moving LOL
I love k
NFL = WWE
This is a front for credit repair??  That's insanely all too typical.
So I live in Erie.  And I work downtown.   And I have a view of the lake.  God I love that lake!  Welcome home boys!
Albeit subtle... watching the podcast, Jason's monster Wolfhound on the couch in the background, is just rolling around snoozing & stretching.  Clearly comfy in the chaos & humor of this show.  LOL Love it!
Jason Kelce for president!!!!
In KC this weekend totally missed seeing life size cutout of Jason with shirt off 🤣🤣🤣
Jason, I love your leadership!
Jason, how come it’s now called a “Jets Sweep”?  What happened to the “Packers Sweep”?
Can I get a shoutout on the next episode . I’m a Massive Kelce  brothers fan
My boy Travis being a Pepsi lover warms my heart also THE HASH brown!!!! Too bad they are supporting G3nocid3
Vote Kelce for president
Jason doesn't know where his Super Bowl ring is, but he knows where Danielle's gifts are.
Who remembers the Bengals game in Cincy when head coach Sam Wiche got on the mic and said stop throwing shit! We aren't in Cleveland!!!lol
A series on how tailgating differs around the league would be fire by these two.
Sign a 1 year deal with Buffalo Jason, sounds lime you loved it there!
Dog passed out cold In background
When you come for Taylor but these guys get you hooked on football and wanting to watch it. gonna start watching football regularly next season.
I think Danielle is a bit obsessed with
Ice cold IBC root beer is the real winner ❤
New follower…what is a 92%er?
You are a sell out, 20 million to lead people into heart failure and blood clots in their brains. You could not pay me to do that, your a terrible person.
“Snows out. Tits Out” - put it on a tee shirt!!!
Love your program!! I loved to tell my grandson to watch but I wish there was less profanity especially using God's name in vain.
TRAVIS!!! YES!!! Cherry Pepsi is the BEST!
Watch the Jason and Bills Mafia Recap section at 1.75 speed and. YOU. MAY. DIE. So funny, adorable, and just full-face-smile worthy. Who needs anti-depressants when you have these 2 riffing at 1.75 speed? Delightful, y'all.
When you come to Las Vegas you need to goto Torrey Pines Pub on Lake Mead for Scrapple breakfast

The next big thing.....reality show where you go to a different stadium each week and tailgate. Full experience. Epic. Let's Go!!!! Kelce Gate
@newheights #nodumbquestions  what’s the team planes  like?  Are they custom? Sit wherever ? Are you taller guys comfortable?
How could you not love Jason Kelce
Love the Kelce Clan! Just curious, what are your wonderlic scores?
hahaha i also order a la cart at Mcdonalds😁🙌love these 2 brothers
I just noticed Travis removed all the books from his shelf. 📚  Love watching these guys!!
Typically listen to Podcast in background at work. On maternity leave now so stream/watch it on TV...can we please add something back to the shelf where Trav took the books off (that he didnt read. Haha)?! It's so bare! #heresincebeginning
Steak, egg and cheese bagel 🥯 is the best thing at McDonald's hands down!
SODA Jason! Soda!
It’s a shame LeRoy Neiman isn’t still with us to bring Jason’s iconic photo to canvas.
as a bills fan. i have to say thank you for showing true sportsmanship. there was a lot riding on this game. it was edgy after two back-to-back snow ins. many of the fans there were helping digging the stadium out in time for the game. thank you for not taking anything to heart. tell Patrick "sorry about the drink attack" at the end of the game. Also the shirtless beer chug, had me dying. thank you again.
No dumb question for both Travis and Jason: if you have some what are your pre game rituals? And do they change depending if you are home and away ?
GO CHIEFS! I am so ready for the game and so Happy for y’all! LETS GO!! Thank you Travis and Jason for making me laugh! You two are the best!❤
McDonald's Cokes are my go to when I get sick, stomach bug sick, they settle my stomach. I don't know why but they just do!😊❤
You guys make me wish I had a brother.  You guys should do a charity thing where you raise money becoming someone's brother for a day.
Aaron Jones to KC!  Book It 🤌🏼
Jason talking about “calories per dollar” 🤣🤣🤣 my guy!!
Man you guy's are pretty good at this stuff. 👌 Bill's fan obviously with my other posts but hey buffalo is use to it by now we ain't winning shit until we move to that new stadium. There is literally a small little cemetery right next to the stadium yous we're at look it up. Who knows the bills just can't beat the chiefs in the playoffs regular season we can but that shit don't matter. You didn't bring up that little girl Jason picked up to see Taylor that was awesome.
As a Chicago girl, I absolutely love that Jason says "pop"!
Jason you look older than Bron
Did they really turn off the hot water travis?
Injuries killed the bills. But to each is there own the chiefs won and injuries are a huge part of football.
Not enough calories per dollar.
The color scheme makes me think of Wes Andersen too.
Sorry Travis, while I enjoy watching the Cheifs, Jason was the highlight of that game!!!!
This is one podcast, where I’m happy to NOT the condensed version. I want the full #62 & #87 experience without the full contact field experience. 😊😅
LOL, I mean ... you're already at a McDonald's drive thru. Drink order remorse or pride should not be an issue at this point. 😜
Perfficient ? Is that a word ? 26:58
Jason needs to eat a cookie cake stat it’s life changing
I just wanted to take a moment and let you both, Travis & Jason know that you guys are freakin amazing! I admit I started watching your show because I am a Swiftie BUT its because of Taylor that so many of us have come to love football for the first time. I am having a blast learning how the game works and find myself getting excited for games and not just because Taylor might be there. *Travis, you and your pits had me cracking up today when you were talking about how your pits sweat so much! Thank you so much for sharing a part of your life with us and help us learn more about football! You guys make this so much fun!  **please no hate on my post**
Go Lions!!!!!
Hey Jason and Travis please pay a visit to your hometown on the other end of Lake Erie!! We miss y'all!!
Dear Bud Light, please take note, this is what real men look like.
I already watched this but somehow I’m here again 😂 They crack me up 🫶🏻
Green Bay would love to have you two come and tailgate! Same atmosphere as the bills! Legit in the middle of the city
The beer bottle conversation reminded me of when I was a kid there was a playoff game between the Vikings & Cowboys when Drew Pearson pushed off on Nate Wright to catch the winning touchdown.  A Viking fan threw a beer bottle hitting one of the referees. That was the beginning of the end for bottles at games.
I wish I had a brother like these.
Two questions for the both of you , #1. Who taught you the humility you have for owning your mistakes so forthrightly and for also acknowledging others' accomplishments on and off the field? (Parents? Coaches?) #2 Could you do a "G rated sports version minus the expletives for a network like Nickelodeon?  Both of you have careers in broadcasting regardless, once you decide to finally retire! The name "New Heights" means the two of you can go the distance anywhere that you set your sites,  apparently!
When will you two start🎉 correcting the pronunciation of your last name?  I think Kels sounds cool! 🎉❤  I love your kindness for each other, my boys were the most fun athletes in baseball!  Your Mom is a,gem!
Love you guys , funny, talented, and rowdy. You both are great , handsome, and sweet at the same time. Shout to your ladies. ❤️👍👍
Jason, if you're looking for a one-of-a-kind experience, I invite you to come to Butte, Montana for St. Patrick's Day. It's unlike any other. You'd love it!! ;)
pop is the CORRECT TERM! Midwesterners unite EH!
39:31 There was a game in 2001 called bottlegate. Browns vs jaguars it was on  Sunday December 16,2001.
I would LOVE to see heavyweigth Pro bowl!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Jason, Travis, and Taylor...what a trio! The Kelce brothers are not only incredible football players, but they also have a genuine bond and love for each other. It's refreshing to see such a strong family dynamic in the sports world.
First and foremost I love the show. You guys are great. I want to talk about first impressions. I used to hate trav, because of who I thought he was because of what was seen on the news. I want to apologize for that because you seem like a legit good person. This podcast has shown me the real you and I am sorry I judged before I knew. Jason you are just one of my favorite people ever. You are a  real I am who I am person. I live in Missouri around the Springfield area, glad to hear you have a place in the show me state. Trav, keep on being you. The Kelce brothers are what America is all about. You guys rock. Go chiefs.
You guys have to be the most realistic celebrities I have ever watched it’s just awesome
We all know why the game flew by for Jason 🍻😂
Jason, did you happen to have a garbage plate while you were in the area? It's the ultimate food to have, especially while drinking
Loves him worh the little girl getting her poster signed
You two make my day! Xxx love to you😊❤
Needs a commercial from this beer
Go Lions! Everyone in Cali except for the Bay Area is rooting for you. Welcome back, Jared!
Love Love ❤
Jason just seems like THE best guy to hang with!!!! ❤
that hoodie! 👀 🤝🙏
Pro bowl is a joke! Jason just go chill with the Fam! That shit is a waste of
#TailGateRetirement Gotta hit LSU TIGER STADIUM SATURDAY NIGHT!!!! 🙏🤘🙏
I always check their couch for their dogs joining in 🐕 ❤
My last name is Aikman and have been a Cowboys fan ever since the era of Troy Aikman and his crew. HOWEVER, Jason...darnit you have now made me an 🦅 EAGLES fan! 😊😊.  I'm also now obsessed with watching as many KC games I can find too Travis. Though finding what channel/streamer etc...is going to air the games is getting mind boggling lately. Cheering you on for the Championship!! Living in Texas I don't know how many others there are that are fans of the Eagles and Kansas City like me 🤷🏻‍♀️. Oh well....all I know I am all in. Ever since seeing you both play in the last Superbowl. Love this podcast. Thanks for your humor...reminds me of my family 🤣🫶🏻.  You guys are great. Cheering ya on from Texas-
I thought Jason would have mentioned the little girl and her poster. Did he remember that? 😂
What microphone is that?
he said Pop 🤦🏻‍♀️   really?
This is a GREAT  opportunity for a McDonalds Sponsorship. UGH  You could’ve contacted then BEFORE releasing this show!
McDonalds has their BEC Bagel Have you tried the bagel 🤤 🥯
If you like wild cherry Pepsi then you should really try a cherry Dr Pepper AMAZING
Thanks for making us laugh! My no dumb question is what do yall use on your beards to keep them looking so good and shiny?
Wild cherry Pepsi!!! Yes!
Love the show!  My one comment would be Travis I wish you would keep the F words down. A lot of kids look up to you guys and that isn't the best example.  Otherwise you guys are great.
A show where you guys travel around to every tailgate, local restaurants, and meeting super fans for every team would be amazing.
Love this😂😂😂
The reason Coke tastes better at McDonald's is because they send it to them in metal canisters instead of the plastic bags like they do other restaurants. So it ends up tasting better.
Okay seriously, form all us 92% rs and more, what would it take to have a beer with yous two?  Because I am down!  Anytime, anywhere!  Wife is giving birth, but the Kelce's want to have a beer with me?  Welcome to the delivery room boys!  Cooler in the corner, try not to look at her cooter!
You guys should make a album with only the 2 of you guys
https://youtube.com/shorts/2oPz6ckjlJ0?si=QFKk4gSpSiGEA2-E
I'm a Chiefs fan, and I 1000% agree with the rule.  Protect the ball. Period.  All the other rules have been skewed to favor the offense. This one wouldn't be changed on top of it.  You're on the goal line, protect the damn ball. That's it.
If you ever get the chance, you gotta tailgate in Green Bay
Jason, I love the support and love you showed both teams and especially your brother!  Philly Eagles fan 5ever though!! The eagles supported Charles w Henry in Philly where my sister is an autistic support teacher 💚💚💚
Jason, if you haven’t, and you can find one: Mexican Coca Cola! It’s SUGAR not hfcs. Ice cold, in the classic Coke bottle…AMAZEBALLS!
Boys you need to try a cherry Coke/Pepsi for an actual soda shop! Delicious when you see them add the cherry syrup to the core. There is nothing like it!
These guys are good dudes. I'd love to grab a beer with Jason. He's old school meets new school hilarious.
You said it’s right it’s POP NOT SODA!!!!!!
You’re killing me Jason! I LOVE YOU GUYS  btw! Jason losing your big “yeti” shirt!! I’d kill for that shirt! My dad’s from Kansas so I’m a HUGE KC fan! Sorry J love you tho, love your wife n adorable girls! Travis I rock your shirt and KC gear at my local gym in Oregon (24 hr fitness lake Oswego) I’m a 40 yr old mom with teenagers and I spend a lot of my “extra $$” if there even is such a thing on Chiefs gear so I can get yelled at by all the fucking 49’rs fans!! Jason do t retire please! I want to see you play your bro again next year in the Super Bowl where you can come in second again!! Luv ya😘😘🤣
Excellent show!!!
I ❤ them so much!!!
“I ain’t going with this combo nonsense.” Shirt off, shirt on, Jason Kelce is a comprehensive National Treasure.
I bought my boyfriend a hoodie from your merch site and instead of a hoodie with the podcast name on it. It was a T-Shirt that says no dumb questions in a size that’s too small for my boyfriend to wear. I can’t even return it cause it says the order # isn’t right. Is there anything I can do to get the right product I bought?
Thank you so much for coming to Buffalo,bringing your family and friends and making game day very special!
No Dumb Questions:  Has Travis considered being a backup dancer at one of Taylor's shows?
So ..... I understand Jason is entering an "Assertiveness Training" program - you know, to help him overcome his introverted personality .....
Gotta have the Hot Mustard on the sausage egg and cheese mcmuffin!
The Pro Bowl changes to these Field Day games is the dumbest shit I've ever heard. They're playing yard games? Wtf..
Did anyone catch Travis say Tyler instead of Taylor 🤣
Team coke 😋
I moved back to the Ohio-Michigan area to be closer to my aging mom and immediately felt at home seeing the sketchy Lake Erie!
Rams fam here u love this Channel.
LOVE....LOVE....LOVE.....both of you guys!!!! And BONUS POINTES for Kylie!!! She is a TROOPER!!! I am in Seattle, so of course a Seahawks fan. BUT..I LOVE YOUR FAMILY CONNECTION. And I BELIEVE IT!!!!
Need to Tailgate at Lambeau!
WOULD LOVE to hang out with Travis at a game!!! But I REALLY don't think that I could keep up with him!!!! I wish you guys had talked about the SPECIAL GIFT Travis did, with bring cutie little girls up to meet Taylor!!! TOUCHED MY HEART!!!
Jason and Kylie need their own show.
Call him Maauto!!!
It's ALWAYS pop!!!!  ❤🥤
Love all but not the Etsy commercial. Etsy are the worst.
Travis walking in all stylish. Hours later, his brother drinking unknown alcohol from a bowling ball & eventually half naked.  😂😂😂
Love this podcast but Flock Nation 💜🖤 this Sunday.
I’m a Washington fan… I hate the name commanders!!! I would rather have stayed the football team. Everyone I know in the DMV hates the name as well. It was forced not welcomed 🤷🏿‍♂️
Dude, after you both finish your careers, you guys do a series of podcast pregame shows from each NFL stadium a la College Gameday?! That would be incredible! It would take a couple seasons for you to hit each stadium - I think that could be a really fun show!
Alright fellow bills mafia, someone get this man a god damn table 😭❤️💙
I feel very lucky to have a Kelce kelly green jersey! Go birds (and chiefs)
Once you two retire, you should make the New Heights pod a "Go to Tailgates, and Return" so we can see how teams celebrate, how fans celebrate, and more. Give us the look behind the scenes and then review those games of the wek
Jason is right on the mcdonalds 2 sausage,egg, and cheese sandwiches
Deodorant sponsorship incoming in …..5…4…3…2…1
This is no. 8 on trending! Awesome!
Would the Kelce's ever consider playing one last season together in Cleveland?????
When Jason kelce takes his shirt off everyone loves it Post Malone does it he’s on drugs 😂
I live for Wed mornings! Makes walking my dog so much fun!!!!  EVERYONE should listen to it just for the comedy of it!!!!!
I really really want to go to a tailgate, there just aren’t any in the uk for football or rugby matches
I want to chauffer Travis and Jason around in Travis's 1970 Chevelle convertible! That's always been one of my dream cars. FYI, yes Taylor can tag along too.
Okay, I had to stop the podcast because YES! Jason says POP!!! Yeahhh!! lol. We here in southernish Ohio say pop tooooo. This made me just about as happy as when I seen him come out of the window. :)
I think Trav is a beast but I feel like Dalton Kincaid is a beast as well. It was his rookie year but he showed grit all season.
That's right Jason, ITS POP! That's what we call it here in CLE OHIO lol
We need a show ‘tailgate with Jason Kelce’ ASAP!
Bacchus is the god of wine and partying - definitely a good tie in with Jason Kelce!
I wish we had had a chance to party in the DOG Pound in CLEVELAND in the 80's. YOU BOTH REMIND ME OF HOME, makes me miss home a lot. I wish when I worked for 3WE I would have watched you in High school ball. Trav -- I am now living in KC and displaying all my Browns gear at my house. My hubby is a KC fan so we have the same Garden Flags in the front yard of CLE and KC. Would love to catch up with both of you and talk about Ohio and Lake Erie spiritual power.. as discussed in the podcast.  I am a school teacher and live in the northland. Blessings on the rest of the season Travis !!!! Bring one home for the AFL!!!!
Low carber here! Two sausage eggers w/ no 'muffin' & a lg coffee for me. no hasbrowns, yuck.
Always a fun listen, but I wish there was less swearing so I could listen when the kids are around.
Hey dude they make this stuff called deodorant/antiperspirant :).  Great show by the way
Yall are great! I love your support for each other and others 🫶
Hey! Kelce brothers The View on ABC in New York wants you guys on their show.
Even as a different NFL fan, I love listening to your podcast and watching you when you play my team.  Since my team is out, Go Chiefs!!! 🏈
I'm with ya on the combo! A la carte is the way to go!
Mexican Coca Cola in the glass bottles are the best.
It's ironic (but understandable) that she wanted you guys to make a good first impression when it really should be the other way around. Kylie IS already in the family, she already made the team, went to the payoffs and won a superbowl in the Kelsce fam. (Also had  Mama Kelces first grandchildren) Taylor is in the Kelce columbine still. 🤷🏽‍♀️ just saying.    Also why not tell them to just donate the stuff they send you than toss it? Seems wasteful.
I love the Kelce brothers and watch this podcast weekly. The only thing I didn’t like is it seemed Jason had a hard time complimenting the Chiefs team or even the Chiefs fan base who was also at the Buffalo game and helped make the atmosphere what it was. It was great and also very respectful you praised the Bills Mafia, their town and team so well. But I felt this time you had such a hard time also complimenting the other team, the Chiefs and their fans too. Usually, you’re so equal and commendable. But really felt down you couldn’t compliment your brother’s team more. They fought hard to get where they are so much. Going into next wk’s cast, if the Chiefs win again, would love to see Jason praise the winning team and fanbase more just as much. Let’s keep a level playing field. 😁👍🏻👍🏻👏🏼
❤
By the way, guys, it’s pop west of Binghamton New York so knock that off
how does jason not know what a cookie cake is
I love these two. I’ve always really hated football, but Taylor dating. Travis made me really adore him and I just love Jason.
Travis I'm with you... Wild Cherry Pepsi is the best
Travis: i got sprinklers goin on under my pits! Also Travis: puts on a hoodie when hes sweatin his ass off😂😂
I reviewed that fake punt and either linebacker Gay or Bolton was telling the punt return team to watch out for the fake punt. Chiefs were ready for it.
I love new heights. I love the kelce brothers and I love taylor.  But fans being disrespectful to someone that is not part of the actual team is not normal. And should stop being categorized as fans being fans.  It’s the same as boys being boys.    The fans that don’t like taylor are the same ones putting AI photos of her to be hurtful. Threatening her life for just watching football. That’s NOT normal. She is human. She isn’t part of the team. You guys need to stop making excuses for the “fans” poor behavior.
they dont talk about Jason shirtless what a jip
I can’t help but love these guys.  I just wonder if Jason’s girls have popped off with any f bombs.  My 4 year old granddaughter says wtf a lot and then looks at me like she has seen a ghost cause granny doesn’t like it…..my adult kids need to watch their mouths.
Travis I think you accidentally borrowed Taylor's glasses that you wore with your fit! You both are just super refreshing! Cleveland against the world!!! I say Chiefs and Lions for the superbowl!
Just wanted to lyk that the reason McDonalds Coca Cola tastes ESPECIALLY GOOD is because....like some beer, they ship the syrup cold.....and keep it cold ~ that my friends always makes it the ultimate!! (hangover cure)
FINALLY some Lions love. LETS GO!!!
Kylie: Be on your best behavior Jason: Say less i got u 😂😂
Wild 🍒 Pepsi is the SHIT!!!! 10:39
The Kelce Brothers are not only talented on the field, but they also have amazing sportsmanship and show respect for all teams and players, making them true role models for aspiring athletes everywhere. Their conduct both on and off the field sets a positive example for sportsmanship and camaraderie.
they still sound like they are from cleveland with the how/what they say. love CLE, love them 🧡
sick mo fos
i get sick with taylor swift...wtf
the kelce brothers are punks. disrespectful mo fos. Jason just lost..   Sitting in the crowd. You lost fat boy!
When Travis retires y’all should do a show where y’all go to different football cities and show what’s around then show the tailgate on Sunday on how they do things in that city I would watch Jason and Travis going to different cities to show like food places bars then party on Sunday
I love hearing the ‘Kelce girls’ in the background. It’s just like the rest of us on teams calls working from home. It’s a reminder that all of us have families. Jason’s life uncensored
The chiefs should try out Damon Sheehy for recover his determination could pay off big in a year or two
I really enjoy the podcasts! Good Luck Travis!🍀
You CANNOT even compare a Pepsi to Coke… come on Travis, you’re better than that!! 🤣🤣
Shoutout to former roommate of Travis...former Cincinnati Bearcat...and current quarterback of my Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Zach Collaros, who I saw for a second was also in the same suite at the Bills/Chiefs game.   Nothing but respect for Travis for having him along and keeping contact with old college teammates/friends.
Jason is a true analyst, very thorough and great inferences. This should be his next career.
Jason how about joining the CHIEFS Nation next year
If the retirement plan happens, keep it on YouTube please!!!!! No networks. Some people don't have cable (especially international 92%ers) or paid subscriptions... 🙏
No beers are20$ as a can i was at the c eagles game against  tampa we loss but i had a great time
You can get cans not bottles
Hey Brandon…met you in the checkout line at the Langhorne PA Target!
Love these guys go birds
Jason is right, those hashbrowns are OVERRATED!!!
Bro trav u 100% right brother. One fan base at a time. Just infiltrate the tailgate party and by halftime be one with the fans and within the next 4 yrs you'll be ready. #Jason4President
When Jason officially retires a network should hire him to do tailgate segments at every stadium.
Guys, it was the jags versus Cleveland and you were correct that is the reason why they don’t sell bottles and stadiums anymore what happened? Was the refs messed up and ended the game where it should’ve had three seconds left but they called the game and Cleveland fans got so pissed off, they started throwing bottles on the field at players and refs and they made them come back out of the lock room to kneel the ball to finish off the clock. I can’t remember the exact details, but it was something like that.
Hi guys,  I created a new athletic design, that supports ankles, without having to tape your ankles. I would love to have you guys try it out and finally have a shoe that supports athletes ankles, Not destroy them.
Kansas City cookie company sells 100s of cookie cakes with Jason shirtless! Check them out - it’s hilarious!
Take a shot every time they say, "He's playing lights out football". We will all be jumping out of suite boxes! 😂 love you guys!!
Travis's stunned silence at the lack of hash brown in Jason's meal should be a meme.
Another great episode! By the way, I’m a fan of the occasional tongue ties. But I think it might be appropriate for you to pick, say, one of your fourth grade teachers, as the official new Heights podcast linguist to clarify some of those moments.
You need to tailgate the MUNI-LOT in  Cleveland
Give me a “God dame litre of cola,” 😂
Jason I think it’s safe to just tell em “Drink Roulette”
From a bills fan it’s absolutely legendary having Jason Fuckin Kelce at the Big Tree!! 🤘🏼🤘🏼
stick the hashbrown in the sandwich!!
Wanted more tea about what Taylor and and Kylie Jason talked about?? Hope there’s more details about the meet up on the bonus video
Jason Kielce - you are always welcome at Buffalo for a tailgate!!  You did us proud!!!
Jason for president
So you call it pop? You belong in Buffalo
Marv Levy was the coach when Jim Kelley played..( I think..lol)
1:00:20 I love y’all man 🤣🤣🤣 don’t change y’all the best
“He was on the wrong side of the lake” hahahahaha
😂😂😂😂 the patch to the promise land 😂😂they always Crack me up!
Travis rub bakeing soda under you arm it will stop the sweating.
My brother and I should start a page. He is the funniest person in the world
Thanks!
I know it’s not NFL, but if you want the ULTIMATE tailgate experience, you should come to THE GROVE at OLE MISS! #HottyToddy
Travis, you were dressed as the anti-hero & all the Swifties know it.
Travis Kelce SNL story!  https://youtube.com/shorts/5652TAC2flA?si=EMVFk2vPyNr7NR_w
Elle looks like Travis 💕
이형제들 고추..클까..
Y’all do realize that you have to do this podcast forever, right? Because what am I going to do with my life if I don’t have this to look forward to every Wednesday night?!
I seriously fucking love these guys. Their top tier in their positions and such humble down to earth human beings. I don’t know if there’s two better brothers in professional sports that are more relatable than these two.
I’m with Trav on this! Wild cherry Pepsi for the win
I love how the heart wasn't even for Taylor my boy was just trolling like usual lol
Such a sweet and happy story about Jason and Danielle! I see a lot more fountain cokes in Jason’s future. 😂 Love the thought Jason might be driving around with a stack of jerseys just to make someone’s day awesome!  Travis and Jason’s banter is the best.  Love this channel!
all i can focus on is the pup in the background
These men are truly beautiful souls!! 🥹
Best show on the internet🙃🙃🙃
Get Josh Allen on the podcast
I'll paint that picture of Jason  for you Travis!
Jason Kelce for president! 😂
@newheights what do you guys think of the "NFL predicting" on what teams are going to the superbowl by the finalist color scheme?
49:26 amen brother
49:21 amen
49:19 is the best
If Travis gets that portrait painted I legit know someone to paint it.  He has done quite a few commissions for pro athletes.
The way they treat intern Brandon is hilarious 😂😂
lamar save the soul society
I was hoping you guys would talk about the girl that Jason picked up with her sign so Taylor Swift could see her I thought that was so thoughtful and melted my heart 🥰😊😁
I think before Jason retires he should go over to Kansas City and win a Super Bowl with his brother one time! Just an idea😂
Talk about the leaked vegas script with halftime performers and super bowl opponents. Also talk about the super bowl logo conspiracy
wild cherry pepsi omg🔥🔥🔥
Missed the greatest segway in the world from Travis' game day fit to Jason's shirtless saga. Also Travis playing off every single Taylor Swift Easter egg as something else is hilarious.
Coke at McDonald’s is better than any other Coke. They prepare it differently then your average Coke
I love both these brothers!!
Jason's pup in the background LOL! Sacked!
Travis muscles getting so big Jason don’t know wtf to do
Love these dudes 😂😂😂
As a buffalo fan from Toronto I appreciate travis comments. All the best in the next round!! All love no hate. That’s how it should be.
Imma Call Travis MaAuto..
Listen, I get the hype on these 2…I get that they’re funny and beautiful men but dang I just love having a football podcast that I love. I laugh, I cry, get mad sometimes…every single emotion. I’m obsessed with how you talk a good amount of football but also little tidbits into your personal lives that you have no obligation to share, but I so enjoy when you do. Thank you for this podcast please don’t stop anytime soon
The way Trav is laughing at his big brother's craziness is hilarious. You can see how much he loves his big brother, he sees nothing wrong with whatever he does, and then slightly mentions THE TAYOR SWIFT for many, saying: "it's okay Tay said she absolutely loves you ." like she's just this normal girlfriend, treating her the way he treats Kylie, is just awesome..she's not given special mention or anything, just being a part of a normal sentence shows how they don't treat her like others believe, using her fame for clout or anything,  Taylor is just now absolutely part of the pack, KELCE family!
You get a McGriddle, put a hash brown IN it, add extra syrup cause it gets dry. But you can feel your heart stopping.
Travis needs a "guy on the chiefs" sweatshirt!
You guys! Love your podcast. Way more interesting than mine. [Dental Drill Bits]
don’t forget how jason made a little girls dream come true at the game and gave her a memory that she will take with her throughout life. honestly he just fully grasped how much that would mean to her and knew that he was in a position to do something incredibly kind for a little kid. i’m not sure that many other football players would have done the same.
Just to think this podcast was nothing until Taylor. About 1 million+ viewers is here because its Taylors boyfriend. Most don’t know football, how it works, the rules, the players & so on. 😂😂
Sorry, new Comer here. What does 92%ers mean?
Bills Mafia was threatening Bill's kicker because he missed the field goal lol.
Like a wild man!
They will still give you an aluminum can or aluminum bottle, but they will open it for you.
I’m a Dallas Cowboys fan if they would’ve won a playoff game id be out been out there running around buck naked
The man didn’t do anything wrong. Drinking the beer of his choice and celebrating his brothers accomplishments in an appropriate manner
That’s not a bud light it’s a BLUE light Canadian beer
love to watch these guys on my way home from work❤❤
I love the idea of once they both retire going on to experience different tailgates. That would be incredible!
Looks like Dickerson's locker has some good bottles of bourbon on the top
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these two and have from day-one!! And these 2 are the BEST because they had an awesome FAMILY up-bringing and STILL DO!! JASON is the FATHER he is today because of his MOM and DAD !! Can't wait for TRAVIS to become a DAD!! He's already a GREAT UNCLE !! And I can't wait for TAYLOR to join this family!! And THANK YOU JASON for the BEST SHOW at an NFL GAME EVER and giving 2 little GIRLS a DAY they will NEVER FORGET !!!!! LOVE YOU KELCE FAMILY !!!!
Dec 16th 2001 bottlegate
1. Dr Pepper is better than Wild Cherry anything 2. Jason would never be able to make a decision at Cookout😂
My cousin is an artist.  She lives in Independence, Mo.   I’ll bet she can paint Jason’s picture for you Travis….you could support a local artist Travis….let me know and I’ll connect you two.
Travis leaking pits in a T-shirt and changes to a long sleeve hoodie 😂🎉😂🎉🎉🎉
NO DUMB QUESTION = If they change the touchback fumble in the endzone rule, what do you think the penalty should be?
One word Travis: Mitchum.
New Jason Funko Pop figure. Shirtless, red beanie, and screaming.
Cookie cake is cookie with icing in between another cookie ya jabronie
We need Pat McAfee on the show! With all 3 of em in the same room
Best Podcast out there. Keep up the good work!!
Danielle ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes. A crispy cold Wild Cherry Pepsi is what love feels like
So tired of these clowns
Man ive looking for this episode all week. My momma passed away Saturday, and today watching you guys have helped me smile and laugh for the first time all week.
Love the show! I really like the guests, especially Kylie. Jason really hit the jackpot there! Now a special request. Can Jason introduce us to the dogs... please I love big dogs!
Pop is a weeble wobble.....he dont fall down 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
You & Taylor get married yesterday and have 3 kids
trav has got it ..  moonbase 8 was a great performance.  i quoted my fave line directly to tim heidecker when i saw him in atlanta.. 'you saved my life.. i was addicted to the music of phish'..
You guys Definitely need to come to a Mn Vikings Tailgate!! Always a Great time!!
Congratulations Travis on winning another NVP  :).
Dallas in minnesota
2024 years ago there was a man who died for you and the rest of humanity i know this because of the eye witnesses in the day that was Jesus Christ the Lord he didn't condone what Israel did the slavery or the execution saying that “their hearts were cold and broke the law of God”. Now he didn't die just to let you watch porn or kill or insult anyone you want or any other form of evil in eternity after you die if you have not repented and accepted the sacrifice Jesus made and lived in his goodness you will be in hell for eternity where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. you can say what you want you can call me a lunatic you can say thats harsh of a loving God to do that won't change a thing you can deny the truth all you want that doesnt make a lie fact . take what you have read as you will. dont bother sending troll comments i wont reply unless its something worth responding to
Jason & Travis.  You guys are off the hook hilarious.
Travis such a potty mouth this week!  LOL
Did anyone else see the dog that was clearly in a food coma behind Jason?...  Somethin' special in that dog food they're promoting... Lol
The cut to him wearing the hat in the Etsy ad lol
We buried my Dad yesterday 😢. Didn’t get to see your show until today. Thank you for reminding me it is okay to laugh !   You guys are awesome !
Okay Etsy!!!
I have been to a New York Buffalo and Bears game in NY.  Jason is so spot on with the tailgating
Pacheco has caught my attention.  Edwards-Helaire is a BULLDOZER!
You guys are great! Class acts!! ❤Buffalo Bills Fans
The Bills vs Chiefs game was awesome Jason you are a beast!! awesome to see the fun side of you guys. Would love to see you guys out here mentoring our boys ...
Jason Kelce for President
Jason after football, new reality show, you going to tailgates around the country
Jason I love your  dog lounging behind you. Just amazing
Jason’s laugh is my fav
The dog on the couch is my spirit animal.  Zero F's.
There’s two of them
holy shnikies
Pat don’t stand a chance in the Jungle
Please tell me y’all got a far $ack from McDee’s. Over two million views = at least $50k
You like cherry po try half merlot half coke on ice!!!!   Not classy but yumm!
Ngl I love Jason jut not getting the McDonald's hashbriwn is an L monumental enough to keep him out thr hall of fame. The hasbrown literally the most important item fam
Jason doing a series looking at the history of different NFL teams and the fan antics. Yes!!!!!!
I never get the combo either!  But I omit the drink! Probably not the healthiest choice!
My Step sons were at the game with a friend. They were sitting behind the chiefs and drove nonstop from Missouri to the game. They are Veterans. Fought for us in another country. They have PTSD from war. They were very mistreated by Bills fans. Not only did they get snowballs thrown at them in the stands but the fans continued to throw snowballs in the parking lot. They were afraid things would go badly. So disrespectful of them. It was just Mahomes and Taylor that were affected. What about the fans. The ones that gave their life for this country. No one even mentioned it.
Dumb and dumber🤦🏽
Jim looks miserable dancing LOL 🤣 he didn’t even crack a smile
The fact that Travis said that Taylor loved Jason killed me because I could never have a chance to see Taylor or talk to her😭😭
My very first episode and I'm not disappointed in the least 😊 Looking forward to the next episode!
Kelce brothers, both on and off the field, are a dynamic duo!
Jason and Ocho Cinco need to go into business together. Both are McDs fans. 💕
Husband on way home from a work trip today and I made him listen to this episode..told him, you MUST listen...for the McDonald's alone and then...that shirtless hilarity. He's hooked now!
A great game! I had to turn it off a couple times.. stressssful! How do you deal With the stress on the field???
Travis Kelce is such a sell out.  No, I don't want to be asked 20 times to bundle my insurance with State Farm. Those commercials are awful.  Seriously, convincing people to get Pfizer Covid shots, really ? You really need to sell out to BUD LITE, what crap don't you plug?  it's like your gf made got you "trending" and on the cover of "Us" or 'People' and you need to bank off her? Just play football.
Is that a crashed out dog on Jason's couch😂
Travis: "soda eh?" Me, a sconnie: 👁👄👁
I would love to be a Kelce sibling for 1 day with these brothers!!
President Jason!!!!! I said this to my family since that game!!! Poster Boy!!!
100% from a burn victim, if you catch on fire your first thought is not stop drop and roll 😂
I go back watching the Eagles… when Randall Cunningham…. And now we have a new team to cheer for!! Fun!!!
Good on you Trav for taking credit for Mecole's lost fumble. I say that because man he has had a bad rap since his return. The fumble was just one of those last straws with him for a lot of the fans.
I finally can say you are the Best Brothers! Hard workers/ and super fun!  Love the Chief/Bills We need t shirts!! Best Brother Ever!!!
Travis, Please, please stop saying f___k every other word!  Just  STOP!
1000% on Jason side with the combo idea!!! Especially if you have whatever fast food places app!!! You always get more bang for your buck outside the combo's!!! Especially McDonald's, Burger King, and Sonic Drive In!!!
Jason what did your mom say ? 😂 I saw her bust out laughing 😂
I’m obsessed with Jason Kelce! I’d vote him for president 🎉
Love the Kelce!!!
Those accents are so NE Ohio. I love these guys.
Jason for President! Travis for VP!
I love yall sorry Travis but, Go ravens!!!
Travis - Very classy comment for Hamlin. I'm impressed with your dedication and apology for your missed block. The humility you offered to your teammate is rare. You are a true leader.
Jason Kelce for President!!!!!
Please put Travis in a Wes Anderson film!
Jason entirely too loyal to the eagles but him joining the chiefs and playing a season with Travis would be epic
love watching fellow Ohio boys represent
I'm a Bills Fan and I love to listen to this podcast.  These 2 are great!
Y'all are welcome in Buffalo any time!! I'm sorry you had to see some bad examples, but overall we aren't assholes I swear lol.  The Bills could use a Kelce...just saying. Come back when y'all both can come out and play and you'll see nothing but true BuffaLOVE! ❤️
My boyfriend and I did blind test of cherry coke and cherry Pepsi and we were wrong every single round! AKA there’s no difference!
Jason  You have brought so much respect to the position of center than ever before.  I was a hugh Steelers fan 20 yrs ago Lynn swann Terry Bradshaw mean jo  Donavan macnab started the change Lost interest in NFL for at least 10 yrs after I couldn't remember the new guys . Started watching u and trav on Facebook. Hooked now  U 2 show so much love for each other It's inspiring. My brother and I aren't what we should be. Wish it was better but whatever.  Not expecting a response but wanted you to brothers to know it's makes me smile......go Canada go
New to the show here…..so what’s a 92%er?? I wanna be oooonnnnne-ah!
I call them cookie pizzas cause they are in the shape of a pizza!
frank the tank! frank the tank! frank the tank!
Love the Kelce bros.  Fellow ohioans  Also same age about as my kids. I relate to them as they remind of how my kids act,and of course they are great football guys. Ty for your podcast. My brother played around age of 12. Me,only 6,was lucky to start understanding the game early,and getting to see practices and games all through his years of football.
Kelcehowmuchyoucansave
No one talking about the big man jumping back into the box like it was nothing. That sill was shoulder high. That's an athlete lol
Jason's dog just chilling on his couch in the background is classic😉
Come on chiefs let's go!!!! Please win Sunday
Cherry Snow ICEE at the movie theater is the BEST drink to get........or just White Cherry, you will get the ultimate brain freeze if you drink it too fast!!!!!!
Have you ever been to Green Bay?? It’s awesome too!!!!
Sausage Egg and Cheese McGriddles sub round egg will beat your muffin, but IMPORTANT:  Sub round egg, get that flat paper egg outta there and take it to the next level.  The egg is the reason the muffin wins if ordered as is.
Thanks!
Love this!  For those making it to the party recently, what's the reference of 92%ers?
Bills fan here😢 🖐🏻 thank you for the mention, you know you broke our hearts again My girl is a Chiefs fan, and I have a Kelce, Mahomes, smith, Schuster, and my favorite of all Len Dawson signed jersey . I will be supporting “Big red” I’m sorry a few bad apples said some nasty shit most of us in Buffalo are very respectful
Travis - Very classy comment for Hamlin. I'm impressed with your dedication and apology for your missed block. The humility you offered to your teammate is rare. You are a true leader.
What do you mean they don't have a Pro Bowl Game anymore?
Can we get Zach Collaros on the Show? It was nice seeing him in the box during the game. Would love to give him his flowers.  Lebron Stat of the day: 3x Grey cup champion, Grey cup MVP, 3x all star, 2x CFL passing TD leader. 🗣️ WE NEED ZIP ON THE SHOW. Ohio Born and raised 740 baby!!!! Roll Red
I agree!!!!  Travis should  Think about politics!!! He’s frank, honest and Sympathetic and young!!! Most of our Washington politicians are too old!!!
Kelce brothers, both on and off the field, are a dynamic duo!
Jason Kelce for President   I'm F'ing in.  He has my vote.
You need to check out Spangles, located in Wichita Ks. , they have killer burgers and fries you would LOVE!!
Can Chris jones do a good Mitch Holtus impression?
Let’s go Jason! That’s my exact McDonalds order!!
I have a question for Jason, do staff clean out your lockers before they do tours of the linc everyday or how does that happen? Also I am a season ticket member and my family are die hard eagles fans love you guys! 🦅🦅
Need to have Kylie on again
I love your program and both of you but please stop all the F word all the time!!! We do have young ones around while watch Please!!!!
Hai Karate
Love watching Jason’s dog sleep in the background.
The general population is so sick of all the Kelce coverage. The HoF brother isnt a simp to Taylor, at least. Can't. Stand. Taylor. Or YOU!
An entertainment network needs to sign Jason to a deal where he travels around the country to hang out at different tailgates, learn the history of their traditions, and rate the experience! Man v. Football Stadiums!
You guys are awesome I look forward to your podcast every week looking forward to seeing you next week with another win! You are entertaining respectful intelligent hilarious in might I say wonderful advertisements I mean these people got to get you to on the tube with more commercials. They better be hitting your pocket real good. Love you guys following you everyday and every way that comes up go Chiefs good luck God bless. Say hi to Taylor and Kylie and all the family love you❤🎉😊
Swifties sending healing thoughts and vibes to Jason for that elbow and knee 🫶🏻 keep shining that light guys!
Yes, there is a worse team name...the Texans.  It feels like they put in ZERO effort.  It's a lame and pretty redundant...it's supposed to be a team name, not a bastardized name for residents.
Double sausage egg McMuffin hash brown large coffee. Lush
The way Trav is laughing at his big brother's craziness is hilarious. You can see how much he loves his big brother, he sees nothing wrong with whatever he does, and then slightly mentions THE TAYOR SWIFT for many, saying: "it's okay Tay said she absolutely loves you ." like she's just this normal girlfriend, treating her the way he treats Kylie, is just awesome..she's not given special mention or anything, just being a part of a normal sentence shows how they don't treat her like others believe, using her fame for clout or anything,  Taylor is just now absolutely part of the pack, KELCE family!
I agree with Jason. The combo meals are only available for the convenience of ordering. There’s no savings involved. There used to be but not anymore. McDonalds got slick and all the items are regular price now. Even in a combo meal. Random Fact: McDonald’s has an agreement with Coca-Cola that they have a proprietary blend of syrup that no other company is allowed to use. It’s what makes McDonald’s Coke taste better with less carbonation than anywhere else.
Hilarious!!!!  Love these men
I hope I can move like harbaugh when im 61
❤😊😊❤😊❤😊❤😊
We need another episode with Kylie, so she can narrate her side 😂😂
Bottle Gate happened because there was a play that needed reviewed for the Cleveland offense, but the offense went into hurry up and got the next snap off and ran the play. After the second play was ran to completion the referees stopped the game and went back to the previous play and overturned the call. Clearly against the rules of the Football. If i am remembering correctly it stopped the browns from scoring and taking the lead
Tailgate Crashers  The next big hit. ❤ Jacobi NC
Can we get Zach Collaros on the pod? I’m a Winnipeger and it’d be cool to hear some college memories
Last week, I made a comment on your podcast in reference to both of you guys being born leaders. I planted the seed that I think both of you should go into politics after you're finished playing football. This week, Travis made a comment to Jason to go into politics because of the way you treat people in real life. Agree 1000% You guys keep it real and are salt of the earth kind of men. You both have a kind of compassion that is contagious. You have a beautiful family and a real-life story most people can relate to. Thank you for entertaining us every week. Keep up the positivity and support for one another. I'm super impressed with both of you! Have a great week!
I don’t want your combo, your fucky fucky! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
the dog chillin in the back lmao
I had no idea that those thermostats could be adjusted! 😂
There's a newspaper cover of my best friend and his dad throwing bottles onto the field. His arms were holding like 10 bottles and his dad was throwing that shit. The only time in history the refs changed a call after a legal play was ran after.
Jason Kelce for president
The browns game call was from a reviewal of a play after the next play had already been ran. The play was reversed and brown fans threw bottles on the field. Browns owner afterwards took the side of the fans and sparked outrage from the NFL.
Number one on trending and well deserved
Who cares ?
Jason why don't you play a season with KC the KELCE BROTHERs on the OFFENSE!!!
Jimmy's Famous Seafood in Baltimore wants you to join their tailgate!!!!
The dog on the couch!  LOL
The Kelce Brothers are not only talented on the field, but they also have amazing sportsmanship and show respect for all teams and players. True role models!
McDonald’s needs to have the Jason Kelce “not combo” combo  2 sausage egg and cheese McMuffin with your choice of iced or hot large black coffee  Make it happen!
54:33 honestly tho i would love a series where a retired jason and travis kelce go around to stadiums and experience the tailgating. call it “parking lots unknown” or something
Jason 100% doesn't buy the "I got cleated" story.
" I'm not asking for permission, I'm doing this." That is my Hall of Fame Center right there. FLY EAGLES FLY. I absolutely love these guys.
Jason, you’re a man after my heart. My go to breakfast when I’m on the road is a sausage egg McMuffin and a large coffee. As for you, Travis, now every time I make a sandwich and use mayonnaise I hear that weird and funny whipping sound you make.
We can call you anything, Trav?OK MaAuto.. 😂😂
Are we gonna just sleep on the fact that Jason pronounced gif as Jiff?
Luv you guys❤😊
Not recvd.. anything fraud
Kylie:"Jason promise me you will be on your best behavior" Jason: "But I already promised everyone I'd be on my worst behavior "
Whoa 2 million subs!! Labron stat for sure
CHERRY PEPSI😭😭 this why I’m team Travis all damn day
Told not 2 f# bible
BS
Others take over
New Heights side quests when both are retired: Visiting stadiums to tailgate during the NFL season
X2 master speed
I am a steelers fan , but I go to a Bills game once a year for the fans, I live in London Ontario across from Lake Erie,  I am the female version of Jason , but I keep my clothes on , I dont need highlights, lololol I am 61 love your mom
Love the podcast guys all the way from Scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Ill try my best to stay on.
Hi
Why is the merch so high?
AMEN TO WILD CHERRY PEPSI!!
I hope you join us tailgating in Baltimore Jason. We also have shirtless fans, you’ll fit right in!!💜 I can’t wait for this game.
I’m a bengals fan but I truly belige Travis kelce is the best NFL player in history. Think about it. He’s a 2 time Super Bowl champ, great catcher, great blocker, doesn’t make many mistakes, has longevity, god like stats, and has probably won 70 percent of his career nfl games. All that out together, he’s my nfl goat and I actually have Patrick Mahomes in a close second place, very close like by just 1 stat. Third place, I have, Troy polamalu.
I’m a die hard KC fan, so of course I’ve always favored TK, but hearing Jason on say Pop instead of soda has me fan girling . I feel represented.
BRING BACK THE QB CHALLENGE!
Have a Nice Day
Travis Botox in the ole pit area will help ya with that underarm issue ya got going on lol
“Like a glove!”
Shouldn't we start a jabroni statistics? In the first round, how often Travis is telling arighnow and Jason howaboutthat per episod...
please feature Kylie’s cat on the next episode
Can this two be in an animated movie doing voice overs? #newheights 😅
Who’s gonna eat Hasons nippples from the cookie cake ? 🤔 those might go for high dollar like Travi’s rookie card 😂  Or they could be preserved for the Jason candle ? 🤔   Options
Yes guys! Take it to the road and do Tailgates!! It would be a kickass reality show!😂
Die Hard Bills fan and first-time viewer and I was impressed with both Kelce brothers.
I can't with the piece of dog fourniture Jason has 🤣 I have a wolfie as well and that's pretty much their whole day
Go Bills! We might bring the hate, but theres still LOVE :) Travis :)
Quincy Morgan...k-state legend!
Kylie: "don't embarrass me in front of Taylor" Jason: "hold my SHIRT"
Having to change favorite Kelce brother was unexpected but necessary after hearing Jason uses my same McD’s ordering philosophy AND unapologetically said “pop”.
New show idea.... Kelce Brothers Tailgate.....I'd watch it.
Gotta love the Kelce Brothers.
EVERYBODYS DOING IT!
Awesome show!  Thank you YouTube algo
Shows alot about Travis. When the bills players were disrespecting the chiefs and Pat all Travis can do is send love to them.
The best chuckles I’ve had in a long time! What the heck are we gonna do for chuckles during the offseason? WHAT!!!!!????? I could listen to these guys talking about any basic, routine “life” thing (McDonald’s run) all year round!
love this episode 🤟
Cherry Pepsi so cold it's just starts to get a couple ice crystals in it, OMG. It's the best...
Jason, love your madcap attitude.  But so much could have gone wrong with the wild Bills stunt.  First, you could have dropped the girl. Did you get the ok from mom before you hoisted her up?  Criminy, she could have had some kind of physical injury or condition.  Second, now Taylor will probably get even more frenzied fan attention that will detract from the game for others.    You meant well, but dial it back and maybe keep your shirt on around kids.
Harbaugh’s moves remind me of the mailroom scence in Elf 🤣🤣
NE Patriots tailgating is always Epic
Love the show!
Someone commented, Kylie "Jason, be on your best behaviour" Jason "I will definitely be on my beast behaviour"
wild cherry pepsi 🍒 is clearly the best, but cherry coke, cherry Dr Pepper all great 🍒🍒🍒
Grape jelly on the sausage egg and cheese biscuit it is awesome the only reason I go to McDonald's
LOVE THESE GUYS!
Oh, Kylie getting her cat now. And not asking permission. You walked(jumped?) into that one Jason.
Middle school band teacher here (and saxophone player). Our class pet a rubber chicken in a Chiefs jersey named Cluck Cluck Hike was seen hanging off my music stand shirtless jersey in hand this entire week at school celebrating the Chiefs win! Go Chiefs from St Joseph Spartan band! And we love the Kelce family and of course Taylor Swift! ❤
Welcome to BillsMafia Jason!
First timer here asking is that a great dane on that couch. We've had 2 beautiful male Danes. Thanks Guys.
Rum cakes are fantastic yeah Jason definitively lives in the Philly area with that cake reference
Clasdy dudes. Bills fan here. Appreciate you guys...From B Lo, but I lived in Shaker Heights for a minute near to where you good boys grew up. Have a good '24!😊
Jason k.  was the best part of the weekend
Woww…2 million subs landmark!! 🔥⭐️⭐️ Congrats Jason & Travis, New Heights team and all 92%ers !
Yes. The commentators even commented on the high winds, thru the whole game 🏈
JASON has serious eyebrows/ facial hair!   I love these two dudes! 😀
Your Prime story was absolutely amazing. Great job
Too weirdos lame ass y'all know what's up true chumps
Greetings from South Africa 🇿🇦!!! Really a rugby fan but huge fan of this podcast.
Pretty impressed with the napping dog on Jason's couch. Slept the entire show!
Jason you are an absolute amazing human for picking up that little girl so she could show Taylor her sign… you and your brother are amazing people shout out from Oklahoma
This by far, the very best pod cast ever!!
I want to be the first person to sign up as a passenger for the Official Kelce Tailgat tour!
Jajaja I hate your teams but I love You guys Go niners
I'm a portrait artist if you want it painted!!!!
Guys - love the visiting tailgates idea. You can visit them, review them, publish the official "Kelce Tailgate Guide" picking a "best of" every year. Guaranteed lifetime money maker!!😂❤
I with you on the ice cold fountain pop
Travis would you do 'Hot Ones' again?  Jason would you go on the show? Or do one together?
I like how travis talking about the hate is trying to convey how bad it was, and Jason after years in Philadelphia is like "yeah it wasnt bad, they loved you" knowing that eagles fan would shit all over the team they love for losing, just to praise them next week and shit on the other teams in the league
Loved it....another great episode. Have to say Kylie is ma fav. Love her. Powerhouse of a Woman.
The best football podcast for newbies.  Loving it! Even though my family is not so pleased here in Colorado.  Love for all!
#NoDumbQuestions : Can we please get an episode of Kylie and Taylor impersonating Jason and Travis for a segment?! I'd love to see  the women in their lives troll them. 😅
I just realized how much Kylie and Taylor look alike in their picture together in the box!! Yall kids are gonna look like Jason and Kylies kids😭😭 and im here for it!!!
"The View" ladies want Jason and Travis to join them at the table! That would be fantastic!!! 👏🏻👏🏻
Y’all just got invited to The View on ABC 😂😂 no joke ! It was on just now ! They showed you clip jumping out the window.
How did Jason Kelce become the reason that I love football so much?
Congrats on reaching 2 million subscribers!
Bring New Heights to CLE for a live show!!!!!! The world needs a live podcast on the shores of Lake Erie 🙌🏻
I need a ticket 🎟️ 😂
Love you guys 😂 no shirt no shoes 👠 all good
Favorite sibling duo🫶🏻🙌🏻
It's just too bad Jason didn't make it to the Swiftie Mafia tailgate!
The smartest thing Coca-Cola and Pepsi could do is hire them separately to endorse their brands against each other
Jason is 🇨🇦 = “Pop” Secret is out!
Someone clone Jason...I love him do much but part of it isss his love of Kylie and his gorgeous family. I don't necessarily want him...just a rugged man identically like him❤️❤️❤️❤️
(Peggy) My heart was broken again. I've been following the Bills since Troy Aikman was playing for the Cowboys and everybody else in the house was rooting for them. The Bills get so close, and then 💔. I guess if the Bills get knocked out, we will cheer for the Chiefs since John likes them, and we've been following this podcast for a while, and I love their interaction. And, who doesn't like those little girls being raised by a girl dad and an amazing mom? I still want the Bills to win in the upcoming season and will hopefully be able to still enjoy this podcast.
@bertkreischer watch from 1:05:19 -- 1:06:48
Packers choked, 9ers should not have won that game
it's very disappointing that a vocal minority of Bills Mafia was showing such disrespect at the game Sunday - they do not represent all of us - The majority of us leave it on the field and move on - especially those of us who have been fans since the Super Bowl days or before lol.  And Jason is now an honorary member of the Mafia - cause ya can't do bowling ball shots,  jump out a window shirtless, and make a little girl's dreams come true by introducing her to Taylor without gaining our respect!  Next stop - jumping through a table ! lol
My brother about the same age as Travis and Jason we would get along with both of you you guys can party with bills Mafia any day of the week no Buffalo like the rule here was like after a Jets game stop serving beer after the third quarter
Love Jason! He is the best!
Great show! Full of excitement we all felt and laughs. You guys are the best🎉🎉
Fashionista Trav!
Jason needs an show of him going to one tailgate a week and ranking them
This a banger 🔥
I love how Jason’s dog is in the background sleeping ❤❤
Jason is an old man personality in a young man's body. He's like the old guy that keeps everybody in stitches laughing at his jokes and random hilarious thoughts. I love it! Great episode, guys!
Have a similar type of last name, it’s great for cold calls.
McDonald's coke tastes better bc coke ships it to them in steel drums as opposed to the plastic bags everyone else gets lol
Follow me for daily hacks
Jason Kelce fits so well in to Bills Mafia it's not even funny. What a guy. Go Bills.
Prize picks guy Brandon ,Gibbs is not the lions goal line guy. He been breaking long runs for td's. Montgomery is the goal line back .
I can paint Jason's memorable moments! You guys are awesome! @claudia_i_t_zamora
As a proud member of Bills Mafia...thank you!! Your kind words are exactly what we needed to hear!
Jason should travel around with a film crew to visit every teams tailgates and show the madness that ensues. Would make a hell of a video series and get a ton of views!
congrats for nr 1 in trending!
That's right. POP. Not soda. Sincerely, your biggest 🇨🇦 fan.   Also. Jason is too boujee with the a la carte menu items. 😅😅
Jason a real one !!!!!!
Pfizer sell out!!!
That's sounds like green bay tailgating!  So fun
Love these guys but sad to hear that Travis throws away stuff sent in by fans to the stadium.
Snows out, Tits out.
Love your show guys.  You two definitely brighten my day.  Hopefully next year will be the Bills year.  Go Bills.
These two were made for podcasts.

Since I was young man the sausage egg and cheese is the BEST McDonald’s food item 100%
**Hey Trav**  botox shots can help with over active pitt sweating!  Tay Tay will thank you..😏😉👋 You can thank me later Tay!
Im betting 500 on the cheifs 💪
But the dog 😅😅😅😅🥰🥰🥰
McDonalds has the best fountain coke & sprit . That’s why you felt like that Jason .
Sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle with a hashbrown on top
Stop by Union Station for a shirtless Jason Kelce selfie | The unforgettable shot of his bare-chested cheering at last week’s Chiefs-Bills game is seared in our brain.
The sweaty pits is one of my favorite moments on the podcast 😂 and Travis changed into a sweatshirt even though he was sweaty profusely 😂
As a bills mafia member I can truly say that I’m disappointed in our fans for the disgusting things they said to & about your fam. I watch y’all bc I know you guys are always respectful on & off the field ❤
The Kelce brothers are the definition of the phrase class act.
@jasonkelce and @traviskelce I think you both found a new retirement plan and idea for a reality show with tailgating at every stadium. I’d watch! Love this podcast and going to be sad when the nfl season ends
At least Jason has a can of Lysol in his locker. Is there a strange smell??
Everybody Can't Have That Kind of Family FUN. Enjoying Life 😂❤😂❤😂 1:10:18
Lifelong Vikings fan but I am hooked on the NewHeights podcast.  Jason, you have become my new favorite player (no offense to Travis).  You are the real deal, honest, humble, and love seeing Kylie and the girls.  If we had the opportunity to get Philly swag here I would definite by a jersey
WE WANT SNL REACTIONS!
We will gladly tailgate with you boys at La La La Lambeau!!
I had no clue abt football 😂😂but since i seen travis football is everything ❤️thank u travis and jason … its so hard to find ppl in this world who gives u good vibes , positive vibes and thise smiles ❤simply love these teo brothers 🫶 travis s smile is contagious ❤
look at the dog on the couch
It was .10 beer night at the old Cleveland stadium. My Dad was there and told the story for years!
Mafia here ♥️💙♥️💙♥️ love the Kelce brothers! Also, why didn’t Jason bring a table for Jason? 🤣
Just few days in AMZPKK is clearly setting up the new milestone! The only real way to counter the current recession is by acting on yourself, making own decisions and making sure that you got enough no matter what happens. If you trust conventional ways you might end up being homeless or worse at one day, seriously.. This is why I believe in projects like this one which are clearly there to make a difference and it starts right now
Trav changing into ANOTHER light colored top lmao
❤❤❤ love  these guys

"versus" is the Latin word to use when talking about one team against another; "verse" is the word to use when talking about a line of poetry
Can we please add Kylies whistle into the show somehow😅
Totally agree. Burger only. No fries and drink. Waste of time
This episode is hilarious. I love you guys and Taylor however, I gotta rep my home state this week. Let’s go Ravens!!
Pro Bowl: Skills vs Studs. I’m here for it
Need a shirt to come out with Jason hanging out the window with his beverage! Cop!
Chiefs play in Buffalo next year. Can't wait for round 2 with Jason!
Ohhh shut up trav any smart person knows the nfl is rigged they want maholmes to be the next Tom Brady chasing his greatness I like Jason because he’s humble u think ur the shit and ur not shits a sham WwE even worse than that we know cheifs will win because the ratings Taylor swift will bring what corner goes and blocks the wr instead of going for maholmes shits rigged
It would’ve been nice if Travis talked about his TD celebration 😘🫶🏼
As a Canadian the pop reference was awesome and the soda comment😅 to clarify pop is with sugar ie. Coke. Sprite. De pepper etc. Soda is plain soda water ie. Frizzy water with no flavour or colour
As a Ravens fan. I am excited to see you guys play Sunday. Good luck to everyone.  Welcome to Baltimore ❤
I'm officially hooked on this laugh a minute pod cast.  Thank you, it's just what we need!😅
" I don't give a dayyum!" 😂
Who doesn’t get fries or a hashbrown at McDonald’s?! Or the combo! 😂😅
McDonalds has a specific special formula from Coke that no one else does.  McDonalds has its own division/department within Coca-Cola.
I would absolutely watch a show where you guys visit all the tailgates throughout the country to learn more about each city and it’s traditions! You could call it the “The Kelce Brothers Tailgate” you can start with the NFL and then do college football.
Pls never stop this. So much fun to watch.
LOVE this podcast ❤️❤️   love Travis laugh ❤❤
Jason you know what to get Kylie - but you can't get it on Etsy 🐈
Does he have McDonald's rewards?  That's the real question!
Is jason a free agent ? If he doesn't  retire
On the Brady Gronk TDs, was Travis at the eagles superbowl win? If so he's saw 2 more 😳
24 minute mark— convo about some (not all) of the bills fans behavior — Do true football fans not realize when they are excessive overboard way way way disrespectful…. It’s for one bad sportsmanship, it’s beyond fun game banter back & forth… and it’s gone personal & you only shoot yourself in the foot because it makes the team you’re talking horrible shit to.. want to win that much more to prove a point! They already had that fire but you just threw gasoline on that b!tch! 😂🤷🏽‍♀️ in a way thanks for pissing off Pat and trav even more and the rest of the chiefs players! 😘❤
You should auction off the boxes for charity 🎉
Wild Cherry Pepsi?!?  Are you insane?  You've been demoted on my Mount Rushmore of TEs.  There is no recovery, accept your fate #87.
Jason I will drive to wherever I need to to get a jersey 👀🤌🏻
Is it just me or is anyone else feeling Jason? I want me a Jason!!! Such a funny and sweet guy!
😅😅😅 100k views n hour all to hear the hall of fame fat boy with no shirt on story priceless class act of nfl ❤❤
All I know is that Jason needs to join us Eagles fans for playoff tailgating after he retires! He needs the full experience from his fan base, and I need to have a beer with that man to thank him for his epic career!
Love these guys😂
Everyone can agree that Kylie Kelce is a boss. Obviously Taylor Swift is as well. Travis just wants what his brother has. A woman who takes charge.
How’s Taylor tell her I’m the biggest fan and I sadly don’t have tickets to her eras tour
I'm with Jason...I hate combos!
What you should do is jerseys for big fans pictures for fans
7:55 Respectfully the Hash brown is their best item. They will put you in a food coma but they are glorious.
I am a die hard cowboys fan from Dallas, and I’m so conflicted that I love Jason Kelce so much. There is very few athletes that I can listen to and just respect both of them as men and forget they are football players. I love these guys regardless of loyalty!!
Jason is the Best Human!
🥰
Where do we find official BigYeti shirts?
ELLIE’S RESPONSE TO HER DAD LOL
That hash brown goes on the sausage egg sandwich, trust me.
Fountain SODA is the BEST!!!
My question is when is Taylor gonna be a guest. We’ve had the whole family and a lot of friends. Will she ever join the pod
Love the kelces
Love ❤️ Jason and Travis great guys ! But Jason took the show lol 😂
Yall gotta get up to green bay for tailgating…. you won’t wanna go anywhere else !!!!! GPG
Jason turn into the Anthony Bourdain of Tailgates sounds like a hit show! hahahahaha man is killing it!
Love Jason GO BIRDS
The fact that Jason went looking to experience the bills mafia and take in the experience for everything it was. Amazing!! I can honestly say the past few years I've grown to love football because of the sportsman ship ❤
Come on jason wtf it’s to soon to be partying with other fans smh this hurt my soul we lost Jason forever
You guys should get Mitch Holthus on the show
I have never heard anyone other than my boyfriend talk about calories per dollar. 😂
Team McMuffin 100%
CLYDE!  I should get a signed Jersey for all the time, effort and $ I've invested in New Heights!  OK, not so much $ and effort, but some minutes...  Fantastic work by the entire team at NewHeights!  But seriously, ask Clyde to reach out, I got a po-boy for him wit dat boudin!
Lions fan here, so happy they have made it as far as they have. I think a reason why the bucs didn’t use the time out was because the lions were in field goal range so it just would have extended the lead to the point of not being possible to come back. Love the show lots of laughs
Travis' hand i noticed in the postgame Pat's hand had some of the same nicks/cuts- i assumed it was due to the extreme cold ...otherwise looks like he been shuckin oysyters
C'mon Jason Steak,egg,&cheese on a McGriddle
McMuffins and Coke 😂😂 YES!!!!
Keep drinking those Miller Lites!
That McDonalds Coke is the absolute best in the morning
Kudos Jason McDonald’s coffee is da Best!!
I agree with Travis. There is nothing better than a wild cherry Pepsi.
Travis your every other word is  "F..." profanity. Please to much!
Definitely with Travis, hashbrown is peak McDonald's.
thinking about the price of hash browns like they aren’t millionaires😂
Touring tailgates should be the new “Diners Drives and dives “ with Jason and Travis and you guys need to pull up in his old truck. And in the episode you go tour the area and what makes it unique and than go to the tailgates and than go into the stadium and enjoy it with their fans
Harbaugh bringing the Ted Lasso dance move vibes to the locker room ☠️😂
59:43
Why is Jason’s hair and beard reddish? Did you do it to match Kylie’s hair?
Thanks for calling it what it’s called… Pop 😂
Jason… we will have you back in Buffalo all day every day. Travis… you’re only welcome here out of uniform 🤣. No hate but so sick of meeting you in the playoffs lol. Thank you both for all the respect you put on our team and our Mafia.
Try Cherry Coke ZERO. You'll never drink the sugary stuff again. WOW.
McDonalds hashbrowns and Pepsi. Travis is the man! Definately……..
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8TyB9Wd5Q3U
Amazing pod cast why is Travis called big yeti
Love the fact that Kylie was wearing a subtle nod to the Chiefs but staying true to her word, no other teams jersey. Sorry Travis!
🙏😑The whole world is set up to show consequences for doing wrong. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. We all must be willing to turn from sin and believe and follow Jesus for forgiveness. 1st John 2:17 He who does the will of God abides for eternity. That’s letting Jesus live His life in and through us His children, by knowing and obeying the Word of God !!! ❤️📖nkjv🙏🧎🏻‍♂️🕊🇺🇸🕊🏆🏈
Travis needs to go crazy on Sunday we need this dub everyone is counting us out
My brother one time caught himself on fire and he also didn't stop, drop, and roll. When I asked him about it he said "I was on fucking fire!".
The dog behind Jason made my whole day
You guys remind me of times when I was younger and listening to my brothers. Hilarious! Jason, you look so pale. I hope you get a bit of sun and that you are okay. Travis, thank you for being so supportive of Jason after the Eagles were knocked out of play.
Travis is that a Gretzky Jersey behind you LA Kings behind you on the floor? Im so jealous if so! 😊
Best of luck Travis . Jason is that a cat or dog behind you on the sofa?  great podcast gentlemen.
Enjoy the topics altho it'll be great without the profanities.
As a person in Buffalo I can say I feel like a traitor watching this, however they are so fun to watch. Jason is so fun to watch and after seeing the game Jason you are bills mafia material
Just wanted to let you guys know I really appreciate your podcast. I was recently diagnosed with cancer and it's gonna be an uphill battle. Your brotherly banter and stories cheer me up.  Thank you, and may God bless you and your family
Loved the podcast today! No mention of the little girl with Taylor’s sign that Jason got out of the box for to show Taylor??!! C’mon guys- still love ‘ya though😢😢😉
Jason needs to come visit KC and try Black Market Sandwiches new sandwich called ‘Taylor’s Tangy Tight End.’
Love McDonald’s coke!  It’s the best!  I never get the hash browns.   Try the steak egg and cheese on a McMuffin bun with breakfast sauce!  It’s the best!
The Kelce Brothers are not only talented on the field, but they also have amazing sportsmanship and show respect for all teams and players. True role models!
Y’all need to try the Mexican coke. The absolutely the best soda. Try it. Yummy.
The exact same thing happens to me with the armpit sweat 😭 You could be cold and not even warm in any way shape or form and they just leak and i’ve noticed it only starts to slow down when I drink water
as a Bears fan. Jason was on the winning side of the worst miss in history... in my eyes
If only you had one more year to play , and maybe try playing with your brother on same team 😅
When they sell Beer Cans the vendors open it, so it's not fully lethal when thrown
Jason is the perfect example of how to enjoy life. I love it brother.
Loving the dog on the couch 😅
Love you guys! Keep moving!!! Ignore the haters!
Anyone find it strange that Kylie gave Jason a second date, considering they met off Tinder and their first date was him passing out drunk at the bar?   Seems like a true gold digger to me.
Hash browns are the $hit, how you gonna pass em up!
Elevate that sausage, egg, and cheese McMuffin by adding strawberry preserves. It’s electric
My bracket is super fucked 😂. Still have the 49ers to win it all… prove me wrong KC
I use to love Travis Kelce, but the way White America overhypes him is nauseating and very telling. I’m curious how all this would shift if he started acting Black again. Notice you haven’t seen him do the Dougie or Stanky leg anymore. He throwing up hearts now and code switches when he talks to Black folks.
I hope you guys do this show for years to come
21:01 anti hero! Yes we always have tay in there
10cent beer night 1974 absolute legendary night in Cleveland YouTube it
The best value is the soda is that all sizes are the same $1.65. I’ve gotten off the value meals. 1:45 AM Pacific Time in CA
God I love these freaks. Got no idea what they're talking about...but who cares.
Is Jason going to be allowed to go to MD for the championship game? ☺️
I would watch a Kelce tailgating travel show.... Js
I love how publicly Jason showed up to support his brother last weekend. He could have not gone to the game or showed up somber and reflecting his disappointment in the Eagles' lack of success and his retirement. Jason's form of fan-like enthusiasm and obvious care for his brother was a helluva nice break from endless camera shots of Taylor Swift.
JASON YOU ARE WELCOMED AT CIRCLE K IN HOMER GLEN ILLINOIS!!!!  See you when I see you big guy 🤍🫡
Jason you need to go to Baltimore
See you in Baltimore...hope the crowd stays respectful.  My daughter spend a months salary to get me tickets as she knows Ravens fan and Kelce 92er..with some Tay Tay...so excited for game Sunday except for rain. Blessed she sent to to see you play.
Love the fact that Kylie was wearing a subtle nod to the Chiefs but staying true to her word, no other teams jersey. Sorry Travis!
Love the Chiefs but this was the Bills game to lose. All Josh needed to do was to short passes end of the game to open receivers on hot route. All he needed to do get the kicker closer to the goal. They would have won.
You were on 1.99m subscribers, so I just pressed subscribe in the hope it would change to 2m - hoping that I am the no.2m 🙌 Hi from London, UK 🇬🇧 Sarah
I want to learn about football more! What’s the first thing to focus on learning?
If i knew nothing about these two, the way Travis reacted to Jason saying when he first met Ky he was black out drunk is enough proof he is the younger sibling. I love it.
Need Josh Allen on podcast
Omg Jason would love New Orleans Mardi Gras !!!
Jason get the hashbrown and put it in your sandwich.
Jason at the game is giving Brady tkachuk watching his brother in the nhl playoffs
Love Jason no matter what the outcome of the game if his brother wins or lose Jason will enjoy.😂😂
Travis: I don't care what people call me. Me:...okay...T. Kettle. Also, the only Gronk stat that matters is if you can get USAA. 😂
Im glad most of the bills fans were cool. Jason kelcy is a legend . Hopefully they realize not all bills fans are assholes. Every fan base has a few bad apples. Tempers are high during the game but a few days go by and people become human again.
i literally grew up 1 street away from the Big Tree Inn ...in orchard park ny. place is legendary! thank you Jason for coming to see bills mafia!
The fact they call timbs buttas I love it Ohio grown fr 💪🏾💪🏾
McDonalds used to have the best fries, but somebody decided using vegetable oil was better than using beef tallow in the fryers.  Now their fries taste like nothing and so they dump way too much salt on them.  Very sad.  But the establishment wants Procter & Gamble to sell chemicals instead of healthy food.  Turns out, animal fats were always healthy and crap like Crisco and other seed oils were pushed as a "healthy" choice, and that's when Americans started dying of heart disease.
40:00 when ya buy a beer at the stadium the security makes sure the beers are opened for the exact reason you guys are talking about, an opened beer is not deadly a sealed one can be.  and yeah ive never seen glass bottles at a stadium haha im sure those were banned overnight.
That dance by Harbaugh is just too painful to watch 😣
You guys should talk about on next podcast that Jim harbragh is leaving Michigan to go to the chargers
At the end of Lions vs Bucs game, they could take a safety on that 4th down if Bucs use their last timeout. Ravens did that vs Bengals couple years ago. https://youtu.be/xcGwFpGrP9s?si=JsVjrArk1XGRVhVU
stg my pits be like travis, he aint alone
I thought your dog might be deceased for a minute. lol
great podcast... just added going to a Bills game and befriending Bills Mafia to my bucket list ✅
Big cock Brock is the best QB in California history.
Frozen the lumberjack
The digressions are a wonderful rambling form of banter. This is what makes these podcasts such good listening fun. Thanks to the brothers, especially for the giggles and outright guffaws… they get me every time. 😂😂🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿NZ
At 13:58 I was waiting for guitar to hit and the “el travador” with a smoldering eyebrow
just smile my ass off everyweek, thanks for that! Love you boys! Go Bills:)
Congrats Travis, Pacheco, all Chiefs for what a wonderful game against Bills❤
Wild that they say the bugs are unatletic. I know its relative, but damn, any lineman is still a top 1% athlete
Best shit from this show. Is how you cant show Jason being amazing and lifting  the bills fan, little girl. Showing T. The sign. Jason being the sexiest and most normal person doing the right thing is absolutely wrong. ILL gladly burn in hell with you lol
Love all the accidental St.Joe shout outs. We thank you 😂
im with jason a cherry coke is hard to beat haha
mcmuffins are definitely the best.
im not gonna lie J I love combo meals lol and the hash brown is definitely a must lol
I love you Jason, but I’m team Travis when it comes to the hash browns!  I’d venture to say you’ve never had a fresh, perfectly cooked, crispy hash brown from McDonald’s.  You got that old, soggy one instead and it’s tainted your view.   Danielle please hook your boy up
Will taylor ever be an episode
All I can say is, I absolutely loved it!  I’m so glad Jason and Kylie were there. Jason you are everyone’s big brother. 🎉❤
trade a trav rookie card for a signed jason jersey only way it should happen
Can we call you MAAUTO?? 🤣🤣🤣
I CANNOT even look at Jason because I keep noticing Travis making sure that  his pit mops are hidden!!! Kinda like us women that answer the door without our bras on and try to cover them up!!! ROFLMAO!!
Pure diet Jason
we order at mcdonalds the same way
I know it's probably something dumb to do but I'm definitely inviting you guys to my wedding lmao
I spy with my little eyes, @justin_danger_nunley at the 20:45 mark. 😂
Funniest episode so far…  Best line is…  “This is the part of the Jason Kelce charm. I wanna make my best first impression. This is my best chance!" 🤣🤣
Where's the new merch boys
Marv levey was coach during Jim Kelly years
Why does Jason sound like one of those progressive commercials about becoming your parents when he’s talking about hash browns😂
OMG his arm pits
Travis Kelce gets the touch down and then Jason goes viral for the celebration 😂
Do you need some new Big Yeti shirts?! We can make some for you guys and it will support our Girls Flag Football team in Chicago!
Y cut trav singing blink 😂
aren’t u guys promoting those energy drinks? why are you talking about coke and pepsi?! 😂
Bro called Bacchus a chubby little fat guy
My favorites 🤍🤍
I like that you didn’t mention Taylor as much and she can take a break from the media coverage. I would have loved to hear about Jason picking up the little girls. This was so heart warming and made me fell all fuzzy and warm. Your brotherly relationship is so genuine
Jason, the eagles schedule for 2024 was just announced. YOU HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST CLEVELAND AT HOME!!! PLEASE!! From one clevelander to another. My husband is from Philly and we look forward to these rare games, and it won’t be the same without you!
Everyone knows Dr Pepper is on top of the SODA pyramid
Blink 182 and old school in one or two sentences ep8c!!
Eileen's cookies are awesome!  Try her iced lemon cookies! Great show guys!
Did anyone else catch the beautiful song stylings of Trav on the “new news” segment? Perfectly harmonized, and lovely vibrato. 😊👏🎵
As if the chiefs fans wouldn’t be yelling similar ish at the Bills players and families….. gtfo
Also, the hand- its wild what happens in the cold. Things that you would normally shake off will absolutely thrash you when its as cold as that game. As a native of Montana and a cold-weather carpenter, I'm not at all surprised that his hands looked like that after the game.
Travis showing Taylor where the Myocarditus hits  💔🫀💔
This is timmy😁                        👕                        👖                        👟👟 1 like = 1 year (somehow) Add a story of the age you see him 👇
There’s a reason the SEC doesn’t allow alcohol to be sold in stadiums🤪
Drink water kids cause ya daddy not payin for the combo, but wants the fries, and yall back there thirsty😅
Damn, dude cooking some onion rings under those pits early
Kinda got the feeling travis was laughing at Danielle
BIG PROPS for supporting the end zone fumble touchback rule.  I agree!  It's a little wrinkle in the game that stresses the importance of ball security and adds a crazy twist to the game.  That twist can turn a game around.  Sucks when it happens to your team, but it makes you think about taking care of the ball at the most important time.  I've been a die hard Chiefs fan since their very first Super Bowl win.  When that ball squirted out of bounds, I literally screamed "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"  Haha!  Shoutout to Travis for owning the missed block.  That's a teammate right there.  I hope Andy plugs in some opportunities for Mecole to shine this week.
I am so proud to be a 92%er! I Love both Kelce Brothers.
Accelerator?  Is that NCAA approved?
Think the Cleveland beer bottle thing was because they had a play and then another play and then went to the previous play to review it and reversed the previous play
Good luck, Trav! We love you!! ❤🏈💛
Does Brandon the intern look like Baker Mayfield to anyone else or is it just me?
Too (two) much fun!
no way CBS would be okay with reporters posting some angsty kid shit like that. Cry on twitter because you're jealous of someone else's successful career?? You don't deserve access to a locker room with that attitude.
Love the Kelce Brothers! Awesome podcast ❤️
Sausage egg and cheese best sandwich McDonald's has Travis your brother's right
Brought to you by the Coca-Cola Co
Does this show really take hiatus when FB is done? I am already in mourning imagining Weds mornings for weeks and weeks without you two! 🥺
McDonald’s fountain sodas hits different because they still use the metal cylinders for co2 and syrup.
Jason & Travis.  You guys are off the hook hilarious.  🎉😂
Jason for president 2024
lord please let the ravens win🙏
Love the “tailgate” tour idea! When you’re retired
Ok so fade Lamar rush yds, Travis kelce rec yds, and ALL running props in the NFC championship 🤣
This is what got me through my shift at work today … knowing I had this to come home to
53:43 he's was on the wrong side of the lake 😂 Initiation into Bills mafia 😂
Just a little suggestion!  If Kylie wants a cat ... I hope she looks into Maine Coon Cats ... they are really big and the dogs would give respect to that breed.  They are beautiful and their personalities are confident but super sweet.  They come in so many colors too.  The males are more personal (in my experience)
Sausage, Egg and Cheese MCGriddle is the best Sandwich Calories Per dollar Jason!
23:21
Please let the 1st stop on the Jason Kelce Tailgate tour be……Baltimore Jan 28/24!!
Cherry Pepsi is fire!
I love you Travis and Jason your the best center of all time
When I was younger, I went to the final game at Municipal. Browns/ Bengals. Do many beer bottles. They had to play half of the field at the end. That was the craziest game I’ve been to and I’m a Steelers fan. So many females showing their headlights.  People started tearing out the seats.
😂😂😂These Two crack me up!😂🤣🤣 And I know nothing sbout 🏈. Newbie at 62 but love following and rooting for these guys and the teams now....I missed so many years! Truely all American good guys snd both are so nice to fans❤ Thanks TS for bringing me into a fun new hobby! i just ordered jackets for both teams😂(I'm not telling anybody I'm from Minnesota)
What’s on Jason’s couch? 😂 (over his right shoulder)
There’s a new thing on fan duel betting…  Will Jason kelce rip his shirt off scream and jump out the window   Yes: -110 odds   No: +250 odds
Belly trail 😂 take you to the promise land #shirtlessJason
I love love your pod its so awesome.  Im just smiling the whole time.  Thank you.
0:32
Travis - Very classy comment for Hamlin. I'm impressed with your dedication and apology for your missed block. The humility you offered to your teammate is rare. You are a true leader.
Bahaha! Jason yes sausage egg and cheese mcmuffin, but one for this girl, skip the hashbrowns and add large coffee. Their coffee is way better, and way cheaper  than any wait in line Starbucks 9 buck jitters coffee!
1.8million views and counting 🎉
Travis i want to say congrats to you and the Chiefs players. Praying over the team safety strength healing to go out and do your job on Sunday against Baltimore.  Go Chiefs 😊
Everyone needs a hype man like big brother Jason!!!
Vanilla coke is the best guys
Bills Mafia love u guys good luck in the next round!  Will see KC Next year!
OH MY GOD TRAVIS IS A PEPSI LOVER 😂😂😂😂 yessssss thank god 😂
Ask @devonrodriguezart to paint the portrait of Jason
sausage egg and cheese muffin is the goat thank u jason
My man said "pop" LETS GOOO
Fountain sprite will rock your world!!
McDonald’s should give us Jason’s meal on the menu
Hey fellas- this is johnny blades in the house -love you guys forever- you guys are the best the football world has ever seen. I’ve been a Chiefs fan since the 60s and now these pass 6 years we are on the top of the word. Thank you guys.
are you guys going to get more hats in
As a proud member of Bills Mafia...thank you!! Your kind words are exactly what we needed to hear!
I was one of the people who said he carries jerseys in his truck 😂😂😂😂😂
As a Bills Mafia member i have to first apologize to Travis and Taylor for the disrespect the majority do not justify that type of behavior thank you for giving our guys the love and respect they deserved class act...Jason we LOVE you and officially a Mafia member nothing will ever compare❤❤❤
Always look forward of new episode 🥰🥰
Jason Funko Pop
First I like to say love the podcast and second I like to know in your time in the NFL what was yall favorite uniform to wear and your your less favorite and which team do you think has the best looking uniform.
Jason cracks Travis up!!
This is absolute gold!!! Love this podcast! Definitely, one of my favorites. Great job guys. Every time you two crack each other up, I just lose it. lol 😂
hi
Hey, guys . Travis here, have a question you cud probably answer. Now that you season is over,( sorry ) are you able to bet or because you could still play no? What about the mrs.?
Talking about Travis’ Wes Anderson style fit (22:10)  Jason: “That was very picture-esq”  Me: I think he meant photogenic?
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Travis  rockin' that  ...Leon the Professional look  !!
Jason, McD's has a secret combination of syrup and carbonated water.  Different than other restaurants.  😊🏈
I CAN NOT wait until they go to different tailgates😂😂😂😂
My friends witnessed all the action at the game.  My favourite new meme is  shirtless Jason Kelce photoshopped into random scenes. Like as in Kate & Leo in the Titanic
Remember at Cindy they threw bottles and Sam Wych got on microphone and said stop we are not the Browns. classic.
How do Phili fans sneak the batteries into the Linc for their snowballs?
OMG …Jason said Pop …let’s go. And Travis hit the nail on the head with wild Cherry Pepsi is the step above the fountain coke! Wow. My whole childhood within 5 min 😂
🇧🇷🤟🏼
You need the hash browns!!!!
You and i one out
Love Travis and Jason. They are awesome people!  I would love it if Travis didn’t cuss so much. Really detracts from his appeal.
TRAVIS USING THE F WORD TOO MUCH.   NOT NECESSARY.   WONT BE WATCHING THEM AGAIN.
TRAVIS IS A PEPSI GUY?!!!
THE MCGRIDDLE IS THE BEST MCDS BREAKFAST ITEM!!!! but the hash browns are def a close second you can’t go wrong haha
The fact Jason played Travis in the SB last year came to Bills Mafia this year and rooted for him this hard. You can’t ask for a better big bro, dudes a legend lol
Wish you could have experience Raider Nation in Oakland!
Deebo's leg was hurt. Xray showed no fracture. Should be a showdown with the Lions this week, will see. The best NFC championship game  was at in 85 Niners and Bears, Niners held Walter Payton to 36 yards to go on and win the Super Bowl, I believe it was 1985 against the Dolphins 38-16
Did Travis forget deodorant ?
I love that the know Wes Anderson films!! 😅
In the louvre: Jason Kelce without a shirt and Travis Kelce’s rookie card!
Excellent episode.  Definitely need to have Kylie on to discuss her side of the game antics.  Let's go Chiefs kick some Raven ass!
You two are hilarious, and I love the love you have for each other.
Notice the dog bowl behind Jason. That may be where he is eating this week after the Sunday night Jason show at the football game. LoL ❤
This is the only podcast I go to for NFL game breakdowns. Kelce bros got me hooked. Much respect to both of you! ✊🏼✊🏼
The dog in the background in Jason’s house. I’ve watched this podcast 3times and the dog is always there, just sleeping away. No big deal.😅
Hearing the kids in the background tripped me out. Thought they were my own for a second, I had to keep pausing to make sure they were asleep. 😂
Thank you Jason! Yes it’s pop not soda!! 😊
Lions fan and wanna say bucs didn’t have that last time out it was tv error. They used all 3 before our final drive. Love watching you guys from Michigan
Jag offs game! I was in the Dawg Pound for it, and people were fighting and getting tossed out the entire time. I was with my younger brother and our homie and I had to tell them not to throw anything lest my uncle's seats get booted.
I LOVE, LOVE,  L O V E  Cherry Pepsi!!!  I had a feeling there was something we had in common!!!   LOL 😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love you 2 so much and love discussions 😅 brother love for sure 💞 I live cherry 🍒 Pepsi also Travis ❤
Blending in the trees 😂😂😂 love this podcast
It takes an amazing amount of charisma to come into a stadium famous for rowdy fans, drink with them, celebrate with them, celebrate your own brother scoring AGAINST THEIR TEAM, and then HAVE THEM JOIN IN! That was wild, and we all loved it.
need a anytime from u plz
Taylor likes a bearded TRAV?
McDonalds has a contract with Coca Cola.  They are the only ones that get their syrups in stainless steel containers.  Hits different.
The cherry Pepsi is a great call. The zero version is fire too
I’m shocked that Travis didn’t give Jason the stamp of the week for his performance in Buffalo! 😂
BEC
Best show ever
He says pop like me! A fellow midwesterner
Jason move your reading prompt so we can see your eyes!!
Travis…your next endzone dance has to be the lions guy on fire !!
Tailgating every game. That right there is a million dollar idea for a pre-game show/segment.
Just in case I needed another confirmation that y’all are the coolest…..you quote “The Ladies Man”
Great game on Sunday!! Apologies for the inappropriate Buffalo fans and their comments!!
Hell yeah I m in on the Tailgate retirement plan
hey brothers you have come up watch a CFL game   a Saskatchewan Rough Rider game...come look at stadium and atmosphere
Love you two! So kind and funny!
Hashbrowns are great. I'm team Travis on this disagreement. :p still can't forgive him for being so against mayo though. :p  Oh yeah, and as far as Football goes, KC vs Bills was exciting to watch. From the kickoff all the way to KC getting that first down that let them take knees(knees are boring) but the rest of the game was the most exciting game I've watches this whole season.
Too bad the zebras are making questionable calls. Betting has changed the aspect of fair. Imho         You two are awesome. Momma K she done good. You guys are funny and loose. ❤❤
Imagine that guy going to the hospital with burns on his a$$ trying to explain that he jumped through a table with fire.
That’s right! POP!
Listen…I am Cleveland born and bred and I would rather attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game than a Buffalo Bills game. Bills fans are not nice. I said what I said. Also, please kindly ask Taylor to bring the Eras Tour to Cleveland. 🙏🏼 Do it for your home town, boys.
I love that u guys kind of bring fans together and like bring down some of the rivalries, a little rivalry is good but I just love that u guys being people together
Love the Kelce brothers. Thank you for the laughs❤
Travis.. if you want a successful career in broadcasting (post retirement) you'll have to talk without using the "F-Bomb" all the time.... it's a good time to start practicing.
I can paint that for you Travis, just let me know how big. 5 ft x 5ft?  But my question is how big of a man is Jason for he sure makes that beer can look small! Btw I'm a pro Artist google me
Oh my goodness, seeing Travis absolutely LOSE IT made me absolutely LOSE IT! Your laugh is so contagious Travis!
Stanky
I’m from Houston, TX. Dr. Pepper all day!!! 🙌🏻
We could call you TK Lol❤
Jason is a man after my own heart with that "calories per dollar" measurement lol
Regarding the discussion you boys were having about Rugby, you have to watch the new Six Nations rugby doc. Rugby is Far more brutal than the NFL!!!!!!!! love the pod 🙌
I get so sad when it’s over 😭 I just love these brothers ❤
Cherry coke from the movie theater is different than anywhere else! It’s far superior to them all.
Shocking that McDonald’s would fuck up a order
Jason having a show on TLC or Food Network where he just goes to different tailgates (NFL, NCAA, etc.) would be one of their highest rated shows ever.
Gotta always get the famous fries at Joes KC.
Jason Kelce for President 2028!!!! You have my vote ❤
Haha. Always go sammy over the combo meal. “Cals per dollar” is on point! So many good “nuggies” in this episode.😂 BROS
https://youtu.be/UqETwCF9dQY?feature=shared
Black coffee, good man! And YUP its POP not soda
Shenanigans is my new word 😂Thanks Jason 👏🏼
New show…Kielce brothers tailgate college and nfl across the country!
Snows out, tits out 😂
I got to meet you Jason thabk you for coming to buffalo and having a great time with us....ty for taking the selfie with me at big tree ...my friend aleesia is the cook there. Come back soon
Concur with Jason, Sausage Egg Cheese McMuffin 100% best item on their menu
I love this podcast and I love at least the way Travis comes off humble he knows they've been very lucky this playoffs they had two defenses that have been decimated with injuries in one office then didn't show up in Kansas City but man Baltimore's going to be tough
I see that fresh cut on Jason!
56:24 🤣 'part of the buffalo bills pageantry' ...best part of the podcast, what a legend
Nothing makes we wanna by hawked products more than Bill Burr and these two jabronis.
59:50 LOL
JASON KELCE YOU ARE MY FAVORITE HUMAN OF ALL TIME
Ravens fan here. But love the Kelce Brothers. Been watching since episode 1. Respect for you both.
Why did they ever stop having the regular pro bowl in Hawaii after the Super Bowl?
Labatt Blue
I love the Sausage Egg McMuffin too, but it surely doesn't love me :(
Love you guys! Keep up the great work😂
Yay for the Etsy sponsoring!
Dear Jason: You shirtless is now my permanent slack photo.
Still love the dog on the couch!! Which one is it? hahahaha
Love you guys, but I, m from B-more, so will be rooting against you !! Travis, do you know any words besides F- - k ????  Enough is enough.  Even Jason used it a lot less.  Come on Travis - people don't have to hear it every other second.  You,re a classy guy, with a classy lady - SHOW SOME RESPECT to your fans.
Team Travis, who doesn’t get hash browns?!?? I go JUST for those!
Some of this is really funny...but remember over drinking in front of your young children does have consequences. Hopefully, that doesn't happen at home regularly. You are too awesome as a human.
I would vote for jason
Travis trying to keep his armpits glued down.  😂
Uncle Trav going for the Jason Beard?
I’m sorry to hear that there was disrespect. There is a line and it shouldn’t be crossed. We are gracious hosts up here. Come back so we can show you and your family love! 🏈
Man's worth millions and still weighing calories/cent 😂
59:05 Jason taking his shirt off.
The z man is such an amazing sandwich. Joes is the best in KC
9:15 “ soda eh” 🇨🇦  hhahah
Jason is made for media 💯
I just watched the Bottle Game video and holy shitballs that was intense!
GREAT JOB GUYS
the best mcd's breakfast is the mcgriddle sandwich with sausage and hashbrown. that egg is way overpriced if jason wants to talk about dollar per calorie
When Jason first removed his shirt and appeared at the window during the game, Tony Romo said that he was Travis’ brother in law!!! OMG! As if the eyebrows aren’t a giveaway!
Bills Mafia loves the Kelce brothers! Watching Jason  made the loss hurt a little bit less! Go Bills!❤️💙
Tears of shock probably
no hash browns - I agree with Travis - wtf
Jason saying “I wanna make my best first impression, this is my best chance” reminds of that videoclip of little Wyatt saying “I gotta do my singing, I gotta dance” and Kylie just accepts it
I think the craziest thing is that Jason doesn’t know what a cookie cake is 1:05:30
Jason are you still in the dog house?
that dog ain’t move in a while
This is by far the funniest episode!!! I laughed so hard
Massive shout out to Jason for picking up that little girl so she could show her sign to Taylor, and making her dream come true.
Travis Botox arm pits thank me later
Looks like he was playing with Olivia, Meredith or/ and Benjamin Button.. 😊
The world has evolved when @Etsy sponsors a football podcast. 😊
21:44 his fit is giving anti hero
😃JASON! YOU  COLORED YOUR BEARD!!!! Did Kylie suggest that because you were meeting Taylor for the first time???
Taylor Needs to get on the podcast before she goes to Tokyo
No glasses here in Seattle, all can & draft
Sending love bros can't wait to see what's next, let's go!!!!  Keep up the good hype and vibes and Jason "Behave not beehive" lmao 😅
I enjoy your pod cast very much but I have a real problem with Travis and the "f" word.  I know old folks don't like hearing it.  Travis you are too good and cool.  I'm sorry if it's an old person thing.  Love the show -  Doonie
Absolutely my favorite episode yet!!❤ Awesome
Hilarious show today! There is a reason why you guys are number 1! Jason please don’t ever change! You jumping out the window was an epic moment! 😂😂😂
I’m a Bills fan.  Love my team more than anything.  Thank you for your kind words. Why are your Chief fans so rude?
Kylie: “Jason, be on your best behaviour!” Jason: “Beast behaviour? got it!”
Oh Travis, it's called Antiperspirant AND Deodorant for the underarm area!!! Used everyday it's an excellent way to impeccable hygiene!!! 🤫😉
Jason, I might just have to vote for you for President.
Good job and  GO CHIEFS!!!
I will do a push up every like this comment gets
They charge like $20 for a beer now. No one tossing full beers anymore haha
So glad Travis as a player made light of the snow balls. As a Chiefs fan i was saying that they are just snow balls. Who cares. Keep throwing them keeps us fired up.
54:53 literally just came up with the funnest Netflix show ever when these 2 are both done
OMG the pit stains 🤣🤣
58:00  Don't forget Travis, Patrick kept you from addressing the people when yall went to the WH. Mahomes: "No Trav not yet, I said after we retire!" lololololololololololololol
Love watching you guys  every week, and making us all laugh! Looking forward to watching you play ( and hopefully win) the Ravens Travis! Jason, love watching you interact with Kylie and the girls, you are a great dad!
We got nothing but love and respect for you guys out here in Buffalo!
The McDonald's discussion is encouraging such unhealthy eating.
Este Show esta Buenisimo 😂😊😅 Exelente Hermanos 🎉🎉
Jason is gonna have to keep playing just to keep this podcast Poppin!! 🎊 🎉
Wait … but the dog in the back on the couch behind Jason 🥹🫶🏼
Question for Jason.   Would you consider playing for KC before you guys retire?
Jason speaks the truth! The best thing McDonald's has on thier menu is the SAUSAGE EGG AND CHEESE MCMUFFIN!!!
ITS HOW IT WORKS
Hey Travis, just show Mecole the clip from his rookie season vs titans were Mahomes jump passes it to him and he out runs 2 defenders! It’s incredible 35:37
Sounds like your event is a drinking competition, any chances they'll add that to the pro-bowl?
Congratulations on you #1 in trending!!!
10/10 would watch a tv show where these two go around the country after retirement to show us various tailgates. Food Network or Netflix needs to get all over this.
Jason, great job recognizing people in your community. That’s a lifetime memory. I love the shirtless show of support! I hope there is someone checking on Bills kicker. He really is in a bad way. He’s a great athlete & everyone has an off day
Jason, you were the life of the party! I loved seeing Kylie hiding in the back of the suite 😅. I’ve been a Bills fan for years as I used to live in western NY. I will not be rooting for the Chiefs! 😂
If Jason retires he has a solid career in commentating games.
Cherry pepsi baby!
Jason had way to many beers!
I wuth runnin the 40 and my penith thlipped out my panth😂😂😂
Don’t ask for permission. Only ask for forgiveness after is the motto here
What a ding bat takes off a T-shirt and puts on a sweatshirt😂😂😂
It was ten cent beer night at a Cleveland Indians game and they ran out of beer early on with people absolutely smashed.
MARQUEZ MADE THE CATCH DIGGS DID NOT
Came for Taylor, stayed for these brothers. Love this show so much
Travis do you have to use the F word? It doesn’t become you.
92% here. Jason for President!!!!
You two are so funny. I enjoy your show. Travis, I hope Taylor love your sense of humor.
My family hole falling was cheering for the chefs just because of Pacheco lol we are Pacheco’s
Buffalo fan here that loves you Kelce boys!!! So funny!! Wish I was at the tailgate to party with you Jason! But love Kylie even more! She’s awesome! Real deal!! 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻❤💙
The f bomb, gentleman, yall better than that !
Not only are you great players but also you are fantastic entertainers! I'm from Argentina and I'm having so much fun listening to your podcasts. You help me to improve my listening comprehesion as well😄 You guys are amazing! Best regards from Argentina!!
2,000,000 Subscribers righr around the corner!
Cherry Coke all day.
Great episode:  McDonald's combo-  I'm with Jason.  Great picture signing her jersey  Jason 1st impression -- classic, motto for you.  " I gotta be me"  Trav's pits 😂 https://youtu.be/XLyiuEK47Go?si=YwN-O0RvoBD6HOoA  Thanks for making my Weds better!!!
As a lifelong member of the Bills Mafia, 3rd Generation, and being named after a famous Buffalo Bills Quarterback (Jamie = Jim Kelly), I would like to offer Jason Kelce an honorary membership into The Family. We abso-fucking-lutely adore you, and need you back for way more games. I live in South Buffalo, which sounds a lot like where you guys were raised! Your podcast and brotherly love just makes me feel so happy, and you guys remind me of all of the friends and family I grew up with. Seriously, you guys are awesome. I’m actually pretty upset that you were down the street in a legendary Buffalo Bar, and I missed the opportunity to be sharing a drink with Kylie and Jason Kelce! Lmaooo!   In all seriousness, I was super happy to see Taylor supporting Travis, and I love watching him be just the nicest gentleman to her. Travis, thank you for showing the public being a kind gentleman to your woman instead of hiding her and making things awkward is ACTUALLY COOL TO DO! It makes my Momma Soul so happy. My daughter and my boys can look up to something positive for once!   I was so excited to see Kylie, Taylor, Papa Kelce, and especially Momma Kelce there! Momma Kelce is definitely low key my hero.   I know it’s a long shot that you guys may read this, but this podcast every week gives me life every week. Something to smile about. It’s like watching my cousins joke about stuff that happened when we were growing up, which warms my heart. Hearing you guys talk about my city and my team with so much love just became my new favorite episode.   Life’s tough these days. The Kelce Fam makes it a little better. Thanks guys.   And I may not be rooting particularly for KC, but I’ll always root for Travis Kelce! Good luck on the next game Big Yeti! But when you come back to Buffalo, I hope our team kicks your ass  ️️   Thank you Kelce’s!!!
HAVE WES ANDERSON ON THE POD ATTACK
HAVE WES ANDERSON DIRECT A COMMERCIAL WITH TRAVIS AND START THERE
G2 Fruit Punch! It taste like Koolaid
Kylie:"Jason promise me you will be on your best behavior"  Jason: "But I already promised everyone I'd be on my worst behavior "
Pop! Tell me you’re from the Midwest without telling me you’re from the Midwest!
Gonna change your world Jason…that’s my fave sandwich too but GET THE FOLDED EGG! It’s the bomb!!!! 😂😂😂
*me hearing a little girl thinking someone’s in my house* realizing it was probably one of Jason’s kids
Here to enjoy this on the weekly , the brothers are fantastic to listen to and watch.    Football games on the weekend are the added bonus.
Uncle Travy, you're killin' me! Great show you two guys. Will the show continue during off-season?
The comments are hilarious 😂
Lions got revenge for Jason against the bucs
I WANT THE OHIO FOOTBALL PLAYERS TO GO TO WRIGHT PATTERSON AND SEE ALL THE ALIENS AND THERE TECHNOLOGY AND THWN HUDDLE TOGETHER AND TELL THE GOVERNMENT OKAY HERE THIS IS WHAT WERE GONNA DO GOING FORWARD
😂😂😂😂yall frigging made my night laughed so hard!  Jason.  If fire gets on you  stop drop roll 😂
Can’t wait to host you guys in Baltimore!! See you Sunday! I love you guys and I bleed purple! Hash browns, dude. 🫶🏻💜🤍🖤💜🤍🖤💜🤍🖤💜🤍🖤💜🤍🖤💜🤍
Travis is so right about that hashbrown 😂
CPH= Calories per dollar ! Haha every gym bro knows that 🤣
As a member of Bills Mafia, I can say our fans can go wayyyy too far sometimes & I do not want them representing me as members of the bills fandom. I seriously respect the chiefs as tough competitors every year regardless of the outcome, & it’s super uncool that some fans went disrespectful with it. Love y’all 💙❤️
Holy Shit! I haven't laughed so much and so hard in a long time!😍
Chiefs fan for life here. New to being an eagles fan. Major love for the Kelce family. But….. i must admit, i would LOVE to see Kylie on here more. Her dry sarcastic manner blends beautifully with your personalities. Adore Kylie!!!  I will always watch this podcast and support whatever ventures the Kelce fam embarks on.
You guys are awesome love the show
O m g - brand new meaning to the v term party caps!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Agreed with Travis. Hash browns at McDonald’s is the best.
Frankly I had no idea who these two guys were. My husband is a lifelong Packer fan. I now listen to these very funny brothers, watch both of them play on their perspective teams and guess who brought me here...come on guess....Taylor  Swift🫶🫶🫶
You both are totally awesome
From the uk never been a fan of American football, huge fan of football proper football but these two have made me actually watch the NFL love watching their pods and watching them play football
Live shows from the tailgates ….Kylie, the people will protect Jason don’t worry 😉🤣
Decide
Bills coach should’ve told his team to pretend they’re airplanes and the Chiefs are twin towers. That would’ve sealed a victory bro
I agree with Jason, cherry coke!
A true Buckeye who said Pop!
Please film your tailgating tour!!!! 😂😂😂
Ice cold Dr Pepper
just hoped they talked also about Jason showing that little girl to Taylor.  I think as much as that made Jason look more awesome, they are trying not to talk much about Taylor, so people stop accusing them, they're using Taylor..but that was one awesome moment, glad it was shown in the news the next day!
New Heights opening music is sick good. Who thought of it?
Steve Harvey  Put Kelce family v Manning family On Family Feud Special football edition
Did Travis get his 19th booster yet?  🤡
The Chief's Management should hire Chris Rubio as their announcer for their home games. Check him out please! He is the best!!!You are missing out!!
Jason: " I gotta have my shirt off." - Totally normal thing to think as you enter a football stadium. 😂
❤ always reppin the University of Cincinnati ❤
Nice catch of Justin Nunley and his son in the Bills Mafia pics.
THANK YOU!!!!! I finally have my “write in” for the presidential election!! Love ya both!! 🏈 ❤️ 💚
You guys are to funny! Love that McDonalds Combo story. Dude you made me hungry ! 😂😂
Dude I hate hash browns too. They suck
Oohhwee Bills Mafia is a good time but Travis, Jason, extend your tailgating up to Canada and join your 92%ers in Hamilton for the Hamilton Ti Cats, more than welcome to come join @marystailgate anytime.  Would love to watch an episode on the CFL and the differences in the game from the NFL.  It’s a good time! 🎉🎉🎉
Snows out tits out👍
Agreed... Combos aren't worth it
Kylie: “Jason, be on your best behaviour!” Jason: “Beast behaviour? got it!”
I can’t explain it but I need to see Jason Kelce doing the lover entrance wearing one of those massive sunset sky flag things
Is that dog okay on Jason’s couch?? 😮
Bahaha the dog in the background max relaxing 😂❤
It’s the dog on the couch behind Jason for me. ❤
Both their laughs are soooo contagious!! The fact the i laugh the same way as travis and people around me complains of the excessive movements but im only 5foot3! Imagine being 6foot5 and being seated in his proximity when he laughs 😭😂
I couldn't love these guys any more❤❤😂😂
I was like oooooh Travis joining Taylor on the coke sponsorship!!! The next thing you know he starting hyping up Pepsi. YA FUMBLED THE BAG TRAV
Travis expressing how the bills should be proud. They worked hard. Came that far with all the injuries and set backs. That is true sportsmanship. Build them up , Travis! Love the love!
Guys!!! The game you are talking about was with the CHIEFS! We are from Youngstown but Chiefs fans and were at the game! Browns player took his helmet off after Chiefs missed a field goal attempt any the end of the game and the penalty gave the Chiefs a second attempt and made it . Chiefs won as time ran out!  Lol
Cherry pepsi ftfw
Bills fan here👋 Hats off to the chiefs. That was an insane game and you guys looked like monsters out there. Travis is a beast! Bills have a lot of tweaking to do and I cant wait until fall for another rematch!! Good luck this weekend, it's gonna be one of the best games all season !
The way Trav is laughing at his big brother's craziness is hilarious. You can see how much he loves his big brother, he sees nothing wrong with whatever he does, and then slightly mentions THE TAYOR SWIFT for many, saying: "it's okay Tay said she absolutely loves you ." like she's just this normal girlfriend, treating her the way he treats Kylie, is just awesome..she's not given special mention or anything, just being a part of a normal sentence shows how they don't treat her like others believe, using her fame for clout or anything,  Taylor is just now absolutely part of the pack, KELCE family!
Congratulations Travis on another Division Championship Game! I enjoyed watching both of you at Buffalo. Jason you were awesome. I love both of you and your family. Good luck Chiefs this weekend!
The real move is to stick a hash brown inside your sausage egg McMuffin
Jason dog in the back ground😂
You should do a show with kylie and taylor after the championship game before the super bowl that would be unique.
This episode was electric and hilarious! I watched the game and when they showed Jason jumping out of the box I knew the podcast episode was going to be a riot. I bet the locker room was crazy with the team telling Travis what Jason did. Go Chiefs, get that W this weekend!
Jason’s hair!!! Looking so good. Sexy man indeed!
Jason, you should buy Kylie a kitty for Valentines Day! She’s definitely mentioned she wants one. You could name it Yeti!
Jason with a Wes Anderson Life Aquatic reference makes me like him even more! LAWSZ is IMO his most underrated movie.
😂😂😂😂 loved watching it live. But you guys talking about it is hilarious!! Jason and his shenanigans 😂😂 The actual football game was awesome! Way to go CHIEFS!
Omgggg Jason is the freaking best tooooooo funny in this one!!!😂 59:02
10 cent beer night is a more notorious  Cleveland beer incident, all time marketing disaster
You boys are hilarious 😂👏🏻. Love this  your guys are the best.  Always Look forward to Wednesday’s. 👍
The game in Cleveland was against the Jags
Oh please, for all things good. Please have Kylie on the show to talk about shirtless Jason and meeting Taylor.
I came to the comments to see what people thought of the dog over right left shoulder. No one noticed this dog is absolutely unconscious, belly up?
Hi Travis I’m a huge swiftie I really want to meet you and Taylor swift  I want to be friends with you guys
I wish they could cut down on the "F" word
Just watching to support the bros ..stay real guys...wish you guys continued success.. stay real guys!
Remember when Philly fans bombed Santa Claus
I think the real star of social media this week was Ellie!!!!  “Dads boobs are showing!” 😂😂😂😂😂
Another great episode guys!  Always look for to your podcasts!  New Heights Wednesdays!
I’m starting a tally for every time Travis says “oooh hooo” and “alright now” 😂😂😂😂
This is the first time I've watched one of you guys' episodes in its entirety, and I must say you two are the funniest pair of brothers EVER! I laughed so hard when you guys were talking about Jason's escapades with Bills Mafia. Just think if the Eagles didn't make the playoffs and Jason did the same thing at GEHA Field at Arrowhead last weekend when it was -4 at kickoff. You talk about nipples! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey Jason you need to tailgate with Niners gang
I can’t help but notice the can of Lysol in Jason’s locker 😏 #poopyfabreeze
No dumb question - has Jason ever scored a touchdown?
LOS ADORO, PERO MAS AMO AL PERRO DURMIENDO DETRAS 🥰
We need Jason vs the machine drinking contest who wins?
Jason can you please give us the real story about WTF happened in that eagles locker room after the Buffalo win?  Y’all got crushed by the 49ers and just cried the rest of the season basically
I understand how Danielle felt! I had the opportunity to take care of Jeff Saturday’s chocolate lab at my vet clinic in Indianapolis. Nicest family and he signed some great gear for my husband. Seriously love athletes like Jason and Travis and Jeff, loving their fans as much as the love them.
Even tho. I have been an advaid Bills fan since the Bruce Smith, Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas era. It was a fun game too watch with everything that went on their.. Seeing Jason Kelce with the Bills fans was priceless. Disappointing Buffalo didn't win, I am hopeful for next year😊
Number one on trending and well deserved 🙏
I could NOT wait for today’s show! One of the FUNNIEST episodes yet!  I LOVE Trav’s laugh!  This was absolutely the “brother” episode, not a sports podcast. Live bein a 92%er 😂❤❤❤
Jason is an Alpha and Mr. PHIZER  is a beta
Hey guys, I love you guys cause you are all so real! Your whole family is awesome. I told my husband that Taylor is the luckiest girl in the world because she gets to hang out with the Kelce family. That would be my biggest wish is to hang out and watch a football game with all of you!  I love all of your different personalities and Jason’s kids are so adorable. Just do the world a favor and never ever change. See you next weekend in Baltimore. LET’S GO CHIEFS!!!❤❤😊
I love seeing the Wave Entertainment logo 👍❣️
Great episode, guys.  Can't wait to see Jason cheer on his brother Sunday.
This old thing? 😂😂😂😂
Husband on way home from a work trip today and I made him listen to this episode..told him, you MUST listen...for the McDonald's alone and then...that shirtless hilarity. He's hooked now!
"Who believes in heart that Christ died to take sins of people and after that rose again -will be Saved."Repent for time is short
We don’t hate you travis, low key we hate that we love you. You guys are genuinely good people and great talents and it sucks that we have to fight against you guys every dam year. I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t hurt because of the shit we dealt with years ago but we love you and we’d love to have you as a coach if that’s a decision you make down the line lol
McDonalds ought to be paying you for this episode. 😂
I can't be the only one that thought the way Travis said 'New News' at 1:46 was ✨️perfect✨️ we need a song featuring him on TS11 🫶
I love the irish wolf hound just hanging out on the couch behind Jason.
the dog!!!
Ughhh I can't
love the wolfhound taking up the couch . I grew up with a Irish .
Travis should have kept Jason closer pre game to get some of that positivity!  Almost every fan base is great in their own way but it sure does seem that Bills Mafia is in a league of their own.
Love how Kylie got his attention that Mrs. Reid was there!! She has his back! So much love!
"Secretly I still want it" LOL
So this week when you come to Baltimore you can have a no shirt battle with real fan dan
I love these guys. I think I had a smile on my face for the entire podcast. Keep bringing the joy, fellas. 💚🖤
Y'all are so fucking funny. I don't know 1/3 of what the fuck y'all are talking about 1/2 the time but it's hilarious!
Just when you think you can't love them any more, here comes THIS episode. A true gem!
Travis is right Cherry Pepsi is CRAZY
I love the show and Jason your the man!
One of my favourite podcasts ever. Just to explain everything. Fuck you cannot beat brotherly love!! (Edit) Fuck I love everything about this podcast and lets not forget. Two absolutely insane athletes!
Pup on the couch is the highlight of this episode 😊
Cherry coke (from the fountain) is king
They crack me up! I'm a die hard Giants fan but the Kelce bros are great guys. Hopefully KC will play in the Super Bowl. I like PM too Excellent quarterback 🏈🏈🏈
Jason should load up some jerseys and do a good will tour with Danielle in the passenger seat
Best beer throwing crazy moment I remember was in Nascar
Jason, ur arguably the greatest podcaster in history, shirtless.
I think if Jason ever retires he should become a coach. Definitely seems like it would fit his knowledge of the sport and would be awesome to pass his experiences onto others!
I think Jason’s dog is glued to the couch. 😂
I just love the fact that these brothers apologize for their mistakes and look sad for committing them without excuses, just man up to it and one supports the other when he's feeling bad.. just great brothers.
Guys,- lots of Tay’s younger girl fans are watching you now.  Time to tone it down on dropping the F-bomb every 2 minutes.
Swifties ruining everything once again.
I want to know more about Jason’s injuries and injuries we don’t know about. He can’t throw a ball cause his elbow is shot? Woah
Travis, upgrade your office area!! lol
Glad you had fun in Buffalo, Jason! You would make an AMAZING host of a travel show where you visit every NFL tailgate in the country. Make that a show. Please. We need it!
Jason and Kylie are the absolute best. They are so lovable!
Im a manager at McDonald's & the reason our Coke hits diffrent is because its stored in 6.5 ft tall metal canisters.
Travis, you are an intelligent man. Please learn some more appropriate adjectives. Enjoy the talks. Hate the f bomb so often. Gotta be something more intelligent you could say.
@Jason, try getting a hash brown next time and split it down the middle and put one half in each of your McMuffins.  You're welcome.
Trying to see if that is a sleeping Irish Wolfhound on the couch behind or a blanket.  Either way - damn, you and Kylie are THE most real and fabulous couple on YouTube ever.  Big fan for about 13 months now (and yup, a Canadian female - who likes Taylor - but b/c if you guys, have developed a “swiftie” love.) Oh, and barely watch NFL until this last few months.   You guys are awesome.  And love the dogs, Kylie and kids most of all.   Thx for the laughs, the reality and for learning me some NFL.   🍻🍻
BEST TAILGATE IN THE NFL IS THE MUNI LOT IN CLEVELAND. PARTY STARTS AT 5AM ON SUNDAYS.  🍺
I watched Kelce yesterday and it was awesome y’all
❤🫶🙌👏
New heights stamp #AllGrit babbyyyyyyyyy
If I was the new owner of Washington, I'd rename them either Red wolves or Sentinels. If they went with Sentinels, Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves would have a box for life. 😜😜😜
Favorite quote “snows out, tits out”
Ideas to add to the Retirement Plan: Jason and Travis Docu-series touring the tailgate environments around the states  Season 1: NFL Season 2: MLB Season 3: they take it abroad and hit up some premiere league matches
No hashbrowns for McD's breakfast is an actual crime...
1:01:38 should be made into a puzzle.
I don't know how, but please get Belichick on the pod lmao 😂
Oh by the way my wife and I started playing Diablo 4 and I created a Barbarian and he looked so much like Jason I named him Kelce 🤘🏻
coolest thing about this pod is that now I talk football with my mom who could give two fucks about the sport. it's so funny that she's interested in this and i love it so thanks guys
J Kelce is so real about the combo meals. Never! Only buy entrees 🙏🏻
Fountain pop actually SLAPS
I remember throwing milkbones from the dawg pound as a kid 🤎🧡
54:42 😂 kylie doesn’t have to go to all of them
That’s so funny Jason because I feel the same way about combos 🤣
I've been trying to figure out what birthed jason's dog and i finally got it.. it's sorta a mix between a donkey and a kangaroo. idk might just be me tho..
Pageantry....
yall need to drink zero wild cherry☺️
I’m with Jason on the McDonalds combos. Anything I read on the menu that sounds good will ordered. The employees try to sneak those combos in but I want food and NOT 4 DRINKS
Thermostat regulators 😅😅😅
Understand the lake effect feeling. I’m a Lake Michigan girl but being near it just feels right.
The dog on the couch 🤣🥹
Good stuff fellas
Honestly, I want Brandon to be a guest. 😂
Listen, steak, egg and cheese bagel, hands down best item.
Had to look up wtf Rumple Minze was....
Next we'll see Trav in an Old Spice Antiperspirant commercial.
Travis has a cat now, that's cat scratches on his hand.
Watch Gronk gonna come out of retirement to get his record back now lol
I just wanna hang out with Jason and have some beers 😂 great game Travis!
Jason is missing out. You put the hash browns ON the sausage egg and cheese for that amazing crunch. The texture takes it to the next level.
“…there’s something about that lake!” Indeed! Born Lorain/Avon Lake for just 1st 3 years. BUT, that’s my lake! Every time I’m next to it!❤️ I think it might be in my DNA
Jason.  Verbally abusive.  Ask his wife to call him "Bro" again.  SMH.  ABUSIVE MEN ARE NOT SEXY.
McDonald's coke is the best anywhere!!!!
trav, can i call you trav? it happens to the best of us. a lil botox in the pits will nip that in the bud if you want 🤷🏻‍♀️ (talkin from experience here) but it is an excellent way to know when to hydrate…no shame in that! 44:44
I hope other KC residents caught Travis’s order at Joes bbq. That was one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever heard. Half slab of ribs, 2 z man’s and a fry?! This dude is ordering for a small village
mcdonalds coke is the best becuz its stronger syrup to make up for the ice  that will water it down
Go chiefs!
Travis’s way of handling the fan hate from the Bills is total class. And probably makes them even madder. 😂 when you don’t get triggered by the bad behavior and just stay confident, it eats them alive. 😅 Freaking hot tbh.
I'm sorry but, the doggie ❤❤❤❤
Spike the cherry coke/pepsi with Sailor Jerry Cherry Rum … YUM!
Travis's little singing " new newwwwwsss"
Jason needs a shout out for lifting the little girl up to wave at Taylor!
Sausage egg cheese McMuffin definitely the best thing at McDonald’s
“i’m gonna go change my shirt” (that i just sweat through) *puts on a sweatshirt hoodie*  😂🤣
Is it ok to call Travis “MaAUTO” then? 😊😁😂
Travis and Jason, This is the first time I have ever subscribed to a podcast. I think you two brothers are great. Jason has a great wife and kids and Travis I'm happy for you and Taylor to be in love. One friendly suggestion to you Travis is maybe not say "Fuck" so much. I'm not religious and I know it's more of locker room talk but you don't hear Jason use that word too much. Good luck to both of you and good luck in the next play off game Travis.
Jason you need to tailgate at Lambeau Field for sure
John Elway almost got hit in the head with a beer bottle in Cleveland more than once.  Browns fans had a reason to be angry tho LOL
Christmas present for mama kelce!! (The painting of Jason) 😂
Reality TV Show Idea... Tailgating with Kelce. If Jason retires he tailgates a different team every week on camera.  He would Crack us up and have a blast.
McDonald’s has the best Coca Cola!!! Hands down!
sausage, egg and cheese Mcmuffin IS the best item at McD's
Will be Jason be at the ravens game
Jason Kelce for POTUS- PALEEZ!
Coke and Mcdonalds ...MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You guys are funny keep staying who you are..
TRAVIS, MY MAN!! ICE COLD WILD CHERRY PEPSI IS THE SH!T!!!🎉
Yall need to go to all the tailgates once retired and make a show of it! People would love it! New Heights on the road!
Im with Travis !!!HASHBROWNS F'ing RULE!!!!!
I think Jason won on the road
On her next appearance:  “Jason left me on the ski slope, in the water with sharks, and in the back of the booth at the game. He never changes, but he’s mine!”❤️.  Today has been awful, but this podcast made me laugh so many times. Thank you!
Travis - Very classy comment for Hamlin. I'm impressed with your dedication and apology for your missed block. The humility you offered to your teammate is rare. You are a true leader.
Jason Kecle for President 😁👍
Love the fact that Kylie was wearing a subtle nod to the Chiefs but staying true to her word, no other teams jersey. Sorry Travis!
Jason when you finally officially retire we hope to see you in the parking lots in Philly and tailgate with all of the Philly phaithful.   Go Birds
Sorry Jason, but I gotta go with 2 sausage mcgrittles. But I feel u on the uselessness of the "value" meal. We just need the sandy & drink.
I'm with Jason - best thing is sausage, egg cheese McMuffin!!
This was an electric episode!!
I give you guys credit I can't put that McDonald's into my body maybe once a year it's not that it's horrible it messes my stomach up and I think a lot of people could agree😢😮
“Wide right part 2” you have no idea how much that hurts as a 45 year-old Bills fan. It sucks. Really felt like this was our year. But great group of hard working men, we will be back next year.
Travis I just want to say Cherry Pepsi IS the best of all time and it’s my go-to! 😂😂 Nobody agrees.
Hell yeah 👍😁👍 Baby I'll come with y'all tailgating Jason 💚 and Trav ❤️💛
It’s pop!! Such an Ohio thing!! Love pop
Jason’s dog giving “draw me like one of your French girls Jack” vibes.
The Carlson brothers kicked for Auburn. War damn! They're actually great kickers!
Don't you get a hashbrown when you order a sandwich and coffee??
Hash browns 😍😍😍😍😍
Chiefs fan all my life and they showed up for the game and showed the bills they didn’t need a lot of plays to win the game buffalo put on a good game against us always love the Kelce brothers on the podcast and going on be watching the game Sunday night against the ravens to win the Lamar hunt trophy. I know Baltimore Ravens are going to be a tough game for us go chiefs and be hoping for the win
I can relate. Call me whatever you want. I go by one thing, I’ll get called by another incorrectly. I’ll answer to both. My last name is Italian. People try to make it sound more Italian by American standards. 🤷‍♀️ IDGAF
Bert Kreischer PALES in comparison to the beauty that is Jason Kelce 🍪
Post retirement plan: Kelce Bros travel to different stadiums and tailgate all year round and then do commentary on the event. Kinda like Manning cast but Kelce cast.
As a Bills fan, nothing but respect for the Kelce brothers and most of the Chiefs team. I won’t take anything away from Mahomes, he’s an amazing qb, but a very disrespectful person. I don’t agree with what fans did/said, but I’m sure they view him in a certain light. And that’s not even being “salty” cause we lost. We were outplayed, plain and simple.
I’m so with you on the Pro Bowl activities! Please get on the board of the pro bowlers to update the activities!!!
No Dumb Question, Just Dumb People: I’m from Houston, I don’t know shit about hockey. Can yall explain the legality behind an in game hockey fight? When and why are you allowed to do it? Go ‘Xans!
Great content!
It was awesome, and he looked awesome!  I said if Mahomes started throwing it to Kelce more, they would win again!  They were throwing to to many receivers more and nobody was ready!
Idk if Trav knows what he’s doing or not but I’m gonna need Taylor’s boyfriend to stop growling into the mic. Out of respect for Tay 🥵
Someone has to make a shirt for Kylie with that picture of Jason on it that says "Back off ladies, that's all mine."
Jason listen to your wife.
Travis is always a little too obvious about not fuckin with the intern 😭🤣
lol only football players and bodybuilders “not enough calories per dollar” love it haha
so if the super bowl ends up being detroit vs kansas city will there be a eminim taylor swift colab to create an opening song for the game? lol
WHO CAN KEEP A WHOLE BOX OF GIRL SCOUTS COOKIES FOR TWO YEARS???!!!! 🤣
Travis im rooting on the Chiefs now that my Eagles are out. I love you guys you are the best. Jason you are my favorite player when you lifted that girl to see Taylor my heart melted. I love sports people who take time with their fans. Years ago i stood in line to get john leclair's autograph his person was trying to rush people along but John was talking to my daughter who was maybe 4 at the time and he said no no I'm talking to this little girl. Your mother raised some fine men.  Go chiefs Fly Eagles fly
snowballs are better than D batteries lol
Freaking love the Kelce brothers & I absolutely LOVE Jason & Taylor Swift being together ❤❤
Also there’s a huge neighborhood across blue ridge cutoff from the stadiums.
There's a sign of shirtless Jason (painted), near the Red X in Riverside. Too cool
Jason I had so much fun watching you have fun. How about another tailgate party at the Ravens game!!!!
Travis laughing!!!!
I LOVE Buffalo, both the city and the people🩵
No one ever said McDonald's hires the BEST specimens out there. It seems like my order ("Hamburger, Bread, meat and lettuce") ALWAYS gets F'd up.
Jason/Travis,  On behalf of all of Buffalo…Thank you!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm a Bills Fan and I love to listen to this podcast.  These 2 are great!
Kylie: Jason behave, we're meeting Taylor. Jason: My tits are bigger than hers.
On behalf of Buffalo, I would like to apologize for the disrespect of the Bills Mafia who notoriously take things too far. Nothing but love for you guys, and great competition as always. At the end of the day it’s just a game and people sometimes forget that. 🫶🏻
Hi guys, be forewarned...long comment here! I just wanna tell ya'll that I freakin love ya'll!  Backstory is that I have never been a football fan...I am a HUGE baseball fan...(GO DODGERS😅!!) I know the game of football a little...picked up a little here and there. I'm an Okie and a dissappointment to my friends and family by the way...but I was on social media and ya'll popped up and as they say, rest is history! Ya'll crack me up and had to follow and now I'm a 92 percenter...whatever that is😂 Thanks for the laughs and updates!
Best episode EVER!
Since your on the topic of tailgates, will yall ever do a Cincinnati tailgate for a homecoming game?
The “”Fit Though””
Jason McD's hashbrowns are fa bomb!
You guys are fucking hilarious. Also, I wanna meet your dog Jason. Let’s get that dog on the podcast next time!
Love the dog on the couch in the background.  The life to be Jason Kelce’s dog!!!
I love the change of, We gotta talk about it. It must have made Travis happy to be the one who got to say, Jason, we gotta talk about it! Love these guys❤
You gotta try coke and cherry grenadine
Travis - have local KC artist Paul Eade do the painting of Jason!!!
Jason needs to get a job as  a coach  on the Chiefs O line  that side line would be lit 🔥  with his Bro !
Love it
Haha Travis, it’s like a treasure map taking you right to the promised land. 😂
Packers is the best tailgate experience.  Jason should do a tour next year if he doesnt play
7:45 Jason knows that they're making all there money selling french fries and soda.  They're selling you syrup water and potatoes.
It’s very likely that the NFL is scripted, and Taylor will be blamed when the Ravens beat the Chiefs next week… and she doesn’t deserve that
Have to side with Jason on the McDonalds order.
Travis should drive around with experimental mRNA shots and give them to fans!
So, question that’s the hot topic online right now. Tampa Bay Super Bowl, was it a home game for Tampa thus making this a road loss for Mahomes. Meaning he’s already lost a road game.
You can get bottled beer in Baltimore. It was an epic game. These two teams never disappoint when they meet in the playoffs!
You turned into a real wuss since you started dating tay tay. Shame you lowered your standards. Hope the chiefs never go to SB as long as you're with miss spread n ready.
Is that a dog on the couch in background Jason?
Travis cleaned out his books. Start planting Easter eggs.
What did Donna Kelce give Jason for Christmas?
OK.....I got Where's Waldo vibe from the pregame fit Travis..   but 100% handsome and fit Waldo!!!
This man a millionaire and said he’s not getting a value meal cause u don’t get your moneys worth😂😂😂😂😂
Wasn't impressed ny a half naked drunk guy picking up kids..not impressed
When are you gonna have Taylor Swift on?
I absolutely love the love and respect you both have for guys around the league. It shows what great guys you are to give other NFL players the flowers and respect they deserve. It also shows your pure love of the game and it makes me like you boys even more. This is coming from a Patriots fan I am die hard Bostonian but can’t help it I love me some Kelce brothers just all around good guys. Keep up the great work on and off the field. I love this podcast keep ‘em coming ❤❤❤
Dude, change your shirt!
I love these guys! ❤I wish the NFL wasn’t scripted…
Thanks! Love you guys!!!
Thanks! Love you guys!!!
I love you two guys.  great football and personalities   Jason is a much better speaker than Travis.  He doesn't need to swear every other word.
Taylor Swift Boyfriend. Is travis now
Great brothers, but I love Dog Kelce just chilling on the couch.
Wes Anderson! Yes!!!
Love Trav’s laugh!
I agree with Jason on the McDonald's order! Kylie, go get the girls a cat!! Taylor will help I'm sure. P.S. the McDonald's soda is the best!
But… can I call you Mister Swift? Will you get upset? 😤
You have to take the hashbrown and put it in the sausage egg McMuffin
We need Kylie on here!!! She just knows how to tell the story! Need her input lol
Wish you would have mentioned the two little girls Jason lifted up to interacte with Taylor.  Your  doing that brought the little swifties to tears.  They will never forget the moment.
Can these guys be any better?
Soda-Pop, Ey.
I love the Sausage McGriddle.  I love Wild Cherry Pepsi.  Do you guys keep going with the weekly podcast after the Super Bowl or is it done until the new season?
How did you not mention how Jason made that little girls night when he lifted her up to show Taylor her sign?
I sometimes have to watch her podcast on segments bc of work etc that's why I am commenting at different times lol ❤
YESSS TAILGATE ACROSS THE STATES
stop drop and roll so disappointed he didn't use it
Travis… just take your shirt off! 😉
Coke in a glass bottle the best
My dad and I have a no dumb question!  How many people travel with the team for road games? Including the roster, coaches, auxiliary staff/personal, trainers/doctors, equipment managers, etc  Thank you 🙏🏼
Cherry Coke all the way!
Love that the media covered Jason. What he did was awesome for his fans.  Taylor had less and she got to be a girlfriend enjoying the game. I feel bad this girls every step is photographed and talked about.
Love this podcast! Super entertaining and I learn a lot about football ❤️
had to look at the sofa in Jason's background for a min...wasn't sure if it was a blanket or a big puppy lol
" I'm not asking for permission, I'm doing this." That is my Hall of Fame Center right there. FLY EAGLES FLY. I absolutely love these guys.
I love that the Kelce brothers are who they are. You get what you get and that makes me happy. Thanks for a great show.
Was it Denver and Cleveland
Jason was living his Best Life in that game watching brother Travis😂❤
That's right, POP!!!
I want to know if Bert Kreischer is pissed that Jason stole his schtick.
The way I was so excited for this episode after watching everything unfold at that game hahaha
Cincinnati has T-shirts
McDonald’s Coca Cola is the best Coca Cola…period.
Jason, you are the best!  😂
MaAuto
I am a die hard Bills fan born and raised. You two are just amazing! I love the respect you have for all teams and players. I’m sorry for any disrespect you received at the game Travis, just know that is the 5% of the people of Buffalo! That’s not who we are and the other 95% respectfully accept the loss. Good luck in the next game! Love you guys! I look forward to each pod cast!
CHERRY COKE IS THE BIZZZNISSS
I love the Kelsey brothers. I am a Bills fan and will talk smack but don’t mistake that as hatred or dislike. It is just a fun rivalry. ❤ #Respect!
All the small things reference was completely missed or ignored by Jason lol
Travis needs to swear less. Not never, but peppering f-words randomly is grating. And, I love the Kelces!
Call him “Maauto”
You get Jason his special cookie cake  ??
Ditto, Sausage Egg and Cheese all the way   Love it!  Travis, the Cherry Pepsi is the best thing ever!  Love you guys!
I am a huge 49er fan but I love these two and their hilarious convos!
Travis I have a Kelly Green 💚 Kelce Jersey if ya want it....if you get my other one signed by your brother Jason!!! I have been an Eagles fan since 1975!!!
Come on Jason, hashbrowns are the bomb
Jason your dog has the life just chillin on the sofa. Thanks for all the years with the Eagles
I’m new to the football world but I’m loving it! Am I allowed to root for the eagles and the chiefs? Is that a thing 😂 I love these guys so much!
In N Out double double animal style hamburger Jason. If you ever make it to Southern California.

youre both wrong the best drink is a sprite from mcdonalds 😮‍💨
Sausage egg and cheese McMuffin with a hashbrown and a Coke is the greatest fast food breakfast of all time.
I haven't felt more respect for Jason until i listened to this podcast. Sausage egg and cheese McMuffin is the best thing on the McDonald's menu and it ain't close
Jason, I’m so glad to hear you like to support Girl Scouts!! I’m a Girl Scout, a 92%er and a Swiftie and I’d love to sell you some Hirl Scout Cookies!
Try a “Spicy” Sprite from McDonalds! Better than the Coke!
The Brothers going on a tailgate tour is the Amazon series we need to see
As a Chiefs fan I hope our home crowd leaves the family insults and other junk at the door. Shout at a player about their performance on the field; that's all good. But leave the family and friends out of it. I hope that Chiefs Nation can be better than some of the other fanbases out there; show a little class to the visiting team. And if you hear someone else yelling that kind of junk at visiting players during a game call it out as "not what we do here 'cause we're better than that".
My fave breakfast place. Walking distance just closed. Best ham egg and cheese
I don’t think I’ve ever heard these two laugh as much as they did together in this episode, so so good!
Jason saying “I gotta have my shirt off!” reminds me so much of Wyatt in the documentary saying “I gotta dance!” 😂😂😂
Jason must have an iron stomach because if I ate two egg sausage cheese mcmuffins and a black coffee I'm running for the bathroom half hour later 😢😂
20 million from Pfizer to encourage people to take an experimental drug. What a FIRST CLASS P.O.S. . Unbelievable people watch this demon.
Jason, stop with bills mafia, let's hear about us, your eagles fans, lol!!!
Gotta love Jason's self awareness! "I'm a hoarder."
I get black out drunk nightly. Shat aht Jason.  It is a normal thing pre kids.  U proceed
❤ you guys are amazing. Ordered Travis shirt and next is Jason's
Nobody can understand that jason is travis #1greatest fan
Jason, you are using that McDonald's app coupon and getting the buy 1 get one sausage egg and cheese right?!?!?  It's a built in combo just for you!
Such a stand up move to owing to your part in the fumble. Like you always say, everything is a team effort.
Help me Tom cruise
I love looking at Jason’s couch and thinking there’s a big blanket, but then I remember it’s a big doggie 🐶😍
Thanks for the great laughs.  I hope Chris comes on the show and does the SNL imitation discussed around minute 16!
When are u having Taylor on?
“tay said she absolutely loved you” as a swiftie turned 92%er (still not quite a football fan but def a kelce fan!) this makes me so happy ❤ love tayvis and the whole kelce family sm
Travia turned into ocho with that biuncing an laughing at jason comparing meeting taylor  to kylie hahaha
Almost at 2 Milly subs 💪💪💪 Getem BOYZ ❤
Laughing until I cried during this one. Love you guys. Let’s go Chiefs ❤️💛
“Tay said she loved you”😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love you in a shirt Jason!  In a shirt!
The chiefs comeback started when the shirt came off. Congrats on the success!
YES..Pop!!!
So electric
Put the picture on a candle for Jason😂 See all he needed for a candle was to come party with bills mafia🤣🤣🤣. As much as it sucked to lose it was so nice to see you have such a great time with our fans! I for sure vote for a YouTube series on tailgate experiences with every team.  That'd be rad
No No No No!!!!!!! It's not POP!!! I repeat it's not pronounced POP! It's SODA!!!!!!!!!!!!! JESUS  I was such a  huge fan until I just heard that word..... Respect -50 points
Travis better break out that coach's dance moves as a celly when he gets the TD vs Baltimore
Travis sweats through a t-shirt, so he  decides to switch to a hoodie?!
Yes it’s pop!!!!!!  I’m in Michigan
if jason kelce can hop a suite and chug 92 beers with his shirt off in the freezing cold w BUFFALO FANS, he can return to philly for another super bowl win. what do ya say jason
As a Bills fan, want to apologize for those idiots that went beyond what is appropriate Travis, you guys brought it once again. I support my team through it all but theres good and bad fans everywhere. Much respect, good luck, 1st time watching you guys, hilarious! Great, guess i like the Kelce bros now lol
Hearing Travis speak in Ebonics is so cringy and it’s every other sentence.
Best episode of 2024
MY DAD DOES THE SAME THING HE WILL NOT GET A COMBO MEAL I DON'T UNDERSTAND
“holy fuckin nice” lmao i’m using this
Sorry I wanna be a fan and all I’m just getting bored over the McDonalds diatribe so I’m out !😊
Let me tell you in Green Bay, and Wisconsin in general, epic tailgating and being in freezing weather shirtless has always very much been a thing here! Definitely not exclusive to Buffalo!!!  Always a great time in Wisco!!! ❤
I laughed the whole time they were panned up to you and your Mom and Kylie’s faces were so pure and hilarious!  Kylie had a look like, “Well, he kept it on longer than I thought!” 🤣 Love you guys!  Good luck this weekend to Travis and KC!  Thank you for the win on my birthday!  It’s the only thing I asked for! 😉
58:09 Jason you're now my official write in. Make Football Great Again!!!
With those boxes, you should sell those and donate the money.
I absolutely love their love of family.... and the love they show their momma ....
Cherry coke gang all dayyy
You all need to experience a LIME COKE. legit - it!
@amyBuff1225- I’m part of Bills Mafia and we are True to our Team and the environment it brings Even more excitement when we get in playoffs ❤
Better watch it Jason...mama Kelce might get the leash out.
If America was a person it would be Jason kelce
Jason Kelce is  built for tailgate party's.  Jason Tailgate Kelce
How did Jason Kelce become the reason that I love football so much?
Yes to the MCDonalds hashbrowns AND to Joe's Z-man (my god, I miss those). I see the Jason's bills game portrait being a nice piece of art for travis's podcast studio. 🤣🤣
Haha, Jason that locker is a mess! But funny Lane has some Woodford Reserve and other Whisky at his locker 😂 11:57
1:46 - Ok Tay coming through with those singing lessons 😏
Possessed lol
As a proud member of Bills Mafia...thank you!! Your kind words are exactly what we needed to hear!
Watching the dog in the back. Is he gonna fall off? How big is that chair? Do you have the recliner foot thing up?
football happened
Boys - 10 Cent Beer Night. One of the finest moments in Cleveland sports history. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Cent_Beer_Night
Yes! Cherry Pepsi!!!!!
New haircut for Jason!
I’ll say it every video best podcast intro
Jason should travel around with a film crew to visit every teams tailgates and show the madness that ensues. Would make a hell of a video series and get a ton of views!
I seen some funko pops of Jason without a shirt on...
this settles it, the 92%ers need a best mcdonald’s item bracket…
Whoa whoa whoa Travis throws out all his PR stuff that gets sent to the Chiefs?!!! That’s wild - wonder how many killer things are in the trash now 😂😂 someone from Kansas go check for us
McGriddles tho??
YES to the Wild Cherry Pepsi!!! (Although I get diet)
You guys are awesome.  Thank you for stopping at the The Big Tree INN. ❤
Jason's 100% right about combos being nonsense most of the time.  I don't drink soda so a combo is like a nightmare waste of money to me.
Jason saying the "aux" makes me feel old lmao.
I love Jason Kelce celebrating at the game man, was awesome to see. I will say, even though I love Travis... KC fans and Mahomes saying everyone counted us out is hilarious to me. Even if the Chiefs aren't as strong as past seasons... when you have the QB, Coach, and great team they have, with that experience, no one is counting you out.... no hate but KC should be the favorites hands down, especially at this point.
Best Episode Ever! I couldn't wait until the new episode came out this week!  Love the Kelces!!!!!!!
Dr Pepper hits the best
Jason missed the legendary opportunity to have the Batman logo shaved into his chest hair.
The best mc donalds is sausage egg and cheese mcgriddel
I live out side of Nashville. So I was  Titans fan. Now I favor the Eagles  and Chiefs fan. Because you two brothers
The disrespect was too much no class sorry to me that's just trash football from their end
Thank you both for some wholesome good ol’ fashioned entertainment!! ❤❤
Kylie: “Jason, be on your best behaviour!” Jason: “Beast behaviour? got it!”
why couldn’t we play like that for my fantasy team
Dude if there was a line chugging contest in the pro bowl i would watch it
What’s your dogs name
Seriously, one of my favorite episodes!  I love these guys! ❤️
Well Jason since your thinking of giving out jerseys come see redz at quickstop in Kensington, come on Jason you can do it!!! And I will give you 2 sausage egg and cheese!!
That wild cherry Pepsi. Yessssss
"Only my pits" 🤣🤣
Sooo…Jason won’t be bundlin’ with State Farm any time soon huh?…
going to pro and college tailgates sound awesome
Atomic Avocado store on Etsy is THE BeST!
Have you guys ever tried Cheerwine? Since you both like cherry flavored “pop” maybe give it a try.
Game changer: A double espresso shot over ice, topped with Coca-cola (preferably Mexican or McDonalds Coca-Cola, which are in fact subtly different than than most versions of the drink).  Good luck with the most productive morning of your life.
I'm a Broncos fan and  was really turned off by our fans making fun of Patrick's voice after our last game with the Chiefs.   Healthy rivalry is fun but  cruel comments are uncalled for period.
I don’t even like football but I ended up here somehow and I am so invested in this podcast 😂
This is part of the Jason Kelce charm!😂
Dear Jason, fun fact! LeBatt has a higher alcohol content than most commercial beers. Its a Canadian beer. Blame the switch for everyone's good time!(because the footage of this was the funniest thing on TV in a WHOLE minute. Never change!)🎉🏈🍺🍻
Loving the dog on the sofa behind Jason.
Drink water jabronis! GO RAVENS!
McDonalds Coke is the best!
How does Jason feel about being the new face of Booktok???? ACOTAR fan have casted him as Cassian. We are all here for it ❤
Lifelong Bills fan here, was at the game.  So happy to see Jason have a good time with the Bills Mafia, would love to see you guys back together for a tailgate in the future.  ggs
Mcdonalds and coca cola have a deal where mcdonalds is the only place that gets their exclusive syrup for their drinks
🤷‍♀️ Snowballs are nothing, when the Bills played the Patriots diIdos were thrown on the field by Bills Mafia 😂
I love you guys & love the podcast. I’m def a 92%er. But I’m born & raised in Bmore and this game between KC and us will be EPIC. Jason, you talk about magic in Buffalo… when’s the last time you tailgated at a Ravens game!? Let’s GO BIRDS. FLOCK NATION. GO RAVENS 💜🐦‍⬛💜🐦‍⬛
I really appreciate Travis and Jason's perspective on the touchback fumble rule. Easy to complain about fairness here, but Trav knows the rule and he even scored himself on the pylon WITHOUT extending! Knows it's not worth the risk of extending out the ball if it's gonna get knocked out or fumbled, and hat tip to him for not bragging about it, not complaining about it, the Kelce bros professionals through and through.
My best friend and I were just talking about wild cherry pepsi vs cherry coke, He drinks pepsi and ima coke guy, i just dont drink pop much as an adult tbh, but a cold cherry coke w/ a bag of chili cheese fritos is top notch cuisine
Damnn the views 🎉🎉😅
Jason, so glad you enjoyed the Mafia. And Travis, so sorry you had to deal with the negativity.  Blessings to you both.
Kelce is the best. It's a Philly thing.
Danielle are you a stalker😅😊
Welcome to the McDonald's Coke club Jason!
Its the Chiefs.  Yall got to lock Chris up.
You both should come to Detroit for the Draft and party with us Lions fans. And try some Buddy’s Detroit Style pizza! Love you guys! Go Lions!
I thought Travis was going to pee his pants for a sec about Jason’s mesmerized by the mafia is priceless!!!
Do you guys really need loud beeps over every curse? Can't you just go silent or maybe like a baby giggling.
IT’S THE SWEATY YETI!! 😂
Can the swifties just let us know what time Taylor is on here?
There is nothing better than ice cold fountian cherry Pepsi. We have a Speedway here that has it, and when I was pregnant, I would make my boyfriend go get them multiple times a day ❤
My twin 5 year old nephews think y’all are talking to them in the podcast and keep talking to y’all and waving hello. 😂❤
Travis fake laugh all the time. It’s awful.
“I physically can’t play dodgeball” **plays center in the NFL
I saw someone made a blobblehead of shirtless Jason haha
Omg! Travis...love you more now! CHERRY PEPSI FOR THE WIN! ♥️♥️♥️
Jason is Daddy
Travis, Pepsi, ugh!!!
I just ate my girl scout cookies that were "best buy" 9/22 and they were great but I freeze them.
McDonald coffee is the bestツ
The fact that Etsy is now sponsoring them shows the massive spike in female viewership they now have.
Just wait until Jason’s daughter’s start dating!!! That should be a sight!! LOL 😂
Jason doesn’t do combos.
First and foremost the best coke is a nice super cold Mexican coke! Greatest thing in the world. The pure Coca Cola nice and cold from the glass bottle. Chefs kiss.
I need a coffee mug that says “engulf that butt”!!!! 😂
That conversation about combos might be one of my all time favorite conversations I've ever heard Jason and Travis have. Freaking epic.
We don’t hate you but giving our fans the finger was unclassy
I will do one push up for every like this comment gets..
Trav, how much does it cost an NFL player to throw a game ball up into the stands like you did after a TD?
These dudes are the greatest😂
The security guard who had to say “Jason, Kylie says to get your ass back in the box!”
THEY WILL NOT SELL UNOPENED CANS ANY STADIUM THEY WILL ALWAYS POP THE TOP BEFORE HANDING YOU THE CANS BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANNA LET YOU THROW A WEAPON ONTO THE FIELD
Packer fan here by no means was the field goal the only thing between the dropped pick 6 by savage Nixons dropped pick the terrible spotting classic Joe Barry however it was clear after Dallas we had a legit shot. We knew Carlson would probably bite us in the ass we should’ve gone and got a competent kicker. Futures bright give love all the money
I need Jason to show up at the DNC and rally the peeps! That would be epic! And the steak and egg Muffin is flipping awesome! 😎
Oh my, these guys crack me up so much. Great show(s), love it. One of the best shows going.
Im with Trav on the hashbrown and wild cherry pepsi!
For a second I thought the Ravens hired Steve Carrell to dance in their locker room. Didn't know Harbaugh had Michael Scott moves.
Can I paint that portrait for you? I know it's a long shot I get the response, but I'd you do, lmk
hey guys im a 70 yr old new fan from the Philippines❤luv you guys❤hey travis go for the win nxt sunday!
Shirtless Jason scene is godly
Can we talk about how many views this podcast got ? , this is amazing !!!
I know personally how much Andy Reid loves you guys and family/s. Did not he draft the both of you?
I get you Jason, Ravens fan here 60 miles outside of Detroit
Congratulations Chiefs  Continue the good work! Routing for you guys!
Jason jump back into the box was awesome...  Overall, this lifetime Chiefs fan has to say; MUCH love to Travis, but man.... Jason Kelce is a National Treasure!!!
It was the Jags Browns game it was bad
I know someone that could totally paint Jason!
not the dog in the back on jason’s couch
Put this heart picture of you Travis on my work computer as the background 😊 lol, and when I was not at my desk, someone changed it😢
I have never laughed so hard at 106 minutes. follow the trail. Lmao
Yo! Wes Anderson send @killatrav a script. The way he recited Old School was damn near perfect!
I expect a shirtless Jason Kelce bobblehead behind Travis soon, set right next to Mummer Jason.
JK 4 POTUS
Travis ask your girlfriend if she is for abortion the act of tearing baby fetuses from the mother’s womb? Is she also okay with little boys and little girls changing their sex? If not, why would she vote for Joe Biden. If she is or does tell her I’ll pray for her.
disco night  Indians
Jason needs to tailgate at Lambeau, very similar to Bills set up in a suburban area
Best cokes are in Germany! They use real sugar…
Just had two McD's hashbrowns this morning and yaaaas Travis they are easily McDonald's best menu item!
They open the beer cans before giving them to you when you buy them.
Im a lifelong chiefs fan, but respect to bills Mafia. Those cats know how to have a good time and are dedicated. Respect to Josh Allen i think he's a hell of a player and seems like a good dude. Everyone was counting them out and i kept telling people they were a dangerous team all season. Great game bills. Let's go CHIEFS!!!
Danielle makes me rethink my dislike of Philadelphian fans. She sounds amazing!
Big Guy 7on7, sign me up, I'd watch the shit out of that.
1975: No OPI on Hail Mary pass, official knocked out cold by flying bottle  Published 13 years ago  on December 28, 2010  By Ben Austro Dec. 28, 1975 NFC Divisional Playoff: Cowboys at Vikings
Can Travis quit cussing so much? Is that evan possible? Say .,.gosh darn, or Gosh dang! Will make you way more attractive!!!! That is why Jason is 99% more attractive!!!
What did Jason and Kylie think of Taylor and what did she think of them??
Jason please come to the Baltimore game so we can see another episode Shirtless Jason this time hanging with the Ravens fans.
hi
Jason I have a question if you decide to play one more season would you consider playing with Travis on the same team
Amen to Travis' praise of Tranquill. What a key player ALL YEAR. What a football natural. I saw him all over the field when he was with the Chargettes and was so favorable when Brett Veach picked him up. A quick mind and sure tackler. Also Clyde E--H is a sure plus when he replaces the Mad Dash from Joisey.
New to watching you all...absolutely hilarious and great stuff.  GO CHIEFS!!!
You guys are great, the fact that you guys can make fast food fun is amazing.
My brother would do the same for me as I would for him. Broski is your number one supportski.
The Feast of Buffalo!
did the bowling ball break after you dropped it?
Bills Mafia loves you guys. We always have Lake Erie. When you’re here it’s home 🫶🏻
Why are you guys so opposite but yet still have so much in common? Travis is such a child 😂 and Jason is sooo much more grown up. What gives?? Also shout out to the MCD SEC. Best thing on the menu. Now that I've basically insulted you, will you please sign a jersey for me Travis?
@Travis "Hey sweet thang,  can I buy you a fish sandwich?"
Well done, boys! Effin’ HILARIOUS!!!
❤ Taylor ❤ Kylie ❤
steelers fans and that game my fiance was pelted in the back of the head by a lot of snowballs
We have to get Kylie’s side of the shirtless story
The dog just chillin on the couch in the background is my total vibe today 😂
Jason you are welcomed back in Buffalo to party with the Mafia anytime! Next year KC comes back here so you gotta make the trip again and go thru a table
McDonald’s literally does do their coke differently. The process is different with the carbonation 👍
Yes the episode of the century
I'll buy you the table to jump through Jason
No shirt Jason will fit right in , in Ravens territory! Check their tailgate out it’s legendary!
Great pod cast guys
Jason holding the 12 year old up was one of my heart ️  felt things. He made her preteen/teen core memories. Now we have a new  football fan ...
People are speculating if Jason is retiring, here I am thinking he might sign with the Bills
duuuuuuuude! you two create a web series of going to every home game and tailgate 👀👀👀👀👀
if jason ends up retiring he should do a show where every week he tailgates at a different game
McDonald's ice cold coke also hits different than every other ice cold coke. Also wild cherry Pepsi, fountain version, is amazing.
Jason going all law and order on Travis hand
Gotta put the hash in the egg sausage McMuffin my man👏
@newheights will Jason be attending the ravens game? if he dose can we expect a shirt lees game ?
Travis has a potty mouth. The more  profanity a person uses = how stupid they are.
Jason or Travis, would either of you guys sign a “one year deal” for either of your teams???? Yes or no??? #NODUMBQUESTION
Jason's enthusiasm for both the game and the fans is what makes football more than just a sport. It's a community! 🏈
The dog seems unimpressed
Kelce brothers teaming up with the manning brothers and a tailgate series would be a thought..
When I saw Jason’s joy during the KC game, letting out a full throated yell after ripping up his shirt I was up and screaming along with him! However, I’m a 64 year old woman and kept my shirt on. 😂
What’s funny is that Jason said he forgot who the coach was of the Bills back in the Kelly era and the section of the stadium that he was sitting in Marv Levy’s name is right over the booth.
Gotta be coke no to Pepsi
Mafia here...  Travis-- I'm sorry for any of us who showed you disrespect. That's not really what Mafia is about... but it's been an emotional year. Next time we play on your bye, come do shots out of a bowling ball and you'll see a whole new experience, I promise you.   Jason-- I cannot even begin to tell you how much Mafia loved that you joined in the "shenanegins"... the true heart of Buffalo football! I hope that when you do decide retirement is the route you're taking, we see lots more of you there! Welcome to the Mafia!   ❤💙❤️💙
Fountain cherry pepsi ❤
L cheifs franchise
If you thought Kylie brings the podcast rating..  Jason’s naked chest really rocks the rating
❤❤👏 go Chiefs
I felt horrible for the Bills' kicker. I mean, it worked out great for us, but damn... I felt horrible for the kicker and team and fans because it was a sucky way to lose. But Go Chiefs!
Damn. Travis rocking that Paul Smith turtleneck.
****                                                                                                                                                                 **** **** Hey guys, question,  will the podcast end or take a break after the football season is over? **** ****                                                                                                                                                                 ****
Anyone else see this all happening at the Superbowl! I’m sure the NFL will make sure that happens
Jason, I’m 100% with you on the McDonald’s.  Their hash browns are just greasy sponges.
Coming from a Bills fan, that was an amazing game. Not mad about the end of our season.  Perhaps get Josh Allen as a guest???😅
@New heights here me out before you retire you need to play a season with your little brother!!
Honey, do you think KFC’s still open?
I was hoping for a mention about the little girl with the sign!! Made her life!
1st time discovering this, algorithm feeling frisky. I have a question from the conspiracy pot....Did Travis perform poorly this season to spite Fantasy Football managers? As a manager, I wonder 🤔
Jason can you come talk to my son and share how important it is to the younger one to have the older one in his life they use to be so close and now not no more cause bad decisions and my divorce go their dad , brotherly love  they need back  and i dont know how to help them and i see you two and as a mom i want this for them again and living near Chicago its hard ,, feel like being a mentor? Jason???
Travis does Taylor mind you saying that F word so much?  I hate it.  But, I'm old.
Jason, you going to Jacksonville?
Come on Ravens please win 🙏 I am tired of seeing the Chiefs in the AFC championship.
There’s the cat playing with Travis‘s headset chord. So darn cute!!! ❤️🩷❤️❄️🩵❤️🩵
I love you guys but “Bills Mafia” doesn’t deserve your or anyone’s respect. They should be ashamed. They harassed and threatened bass including death threats until he deactivated his social media.
Please have Taylor on!!!
Shout out to KC #48, LB and Army West Point football linebacker class of 2019 and Reserve Army Officer, Cole Christensen for making that tackle on the failed Buffalo fake punt. Yes, Academy football players can play in the league. #BeatNavy
Once again guys, great podcast 👏👏👏
I fly out to KC every year for the New Years game.  Talking about great fans and a fun environment!
Travis I thought I was the only one who’s sweats like that!!! I’m so glad I’m not alone in this world 😭😂
Did you get hit with a snowball?  lol
need that tee travs got on 🔥
Could the excess sweating be attributed to coronary artery disease from all the delicious Kansas City barbecue? If Travis starts to get short of breath please head to the ER.  It never hurts to get a cardiac checkup. We love you boys and want you to be healthy.
We need to hear from kylie about it 🤣
Jason PLEASE VLOG YOUR TAILGATE VS BALTIMORE!!! You won’t regret it the bank gets it rockin!!
Jason I have a question if you decide to play one more season would you consider to play with Travis on the same team
Hi guys, love your podcast-fellow Clevelander here.  It was Ten Cent Beer Night at the Cleveland Indians game on June 4 1974
👇 Jason Kelce for president
Fountain Dr Pepper 😍😍😍 tryyyy it!!!
Where are you Danielle? I know you’re in here 😎
jason: i couldn’t get my nipples hard…🥹  travis: aaah that’s a bummer…😔
As a die hard bills fan I just want to say we aren’t all bad!! I absolutely love y’all and have deep respect for the chiefs! Also big swiftie love this relationship for you, Travis xoxo
I work the concessions that sells beer and we only have plastic cups and cans and UH Manoa does not give cans at all to guests so that guests doesn’t injure anyone including players.
I’m just here as a Kylie Kelce fan tbh.
McDonalds will be the new sponsor for NewHeights. Hehe. 😜
After I saw the Mummer suit Jason,  the no shirt Jason looked very simple
Ice cold cherry Pepsi is such a valid answers, nothing hits better than that
Dying for Taylor to come on this podcast, I think she might just break YouTube. Also LOVED seeing Jason at the chiefs game this Sunday.
As a marylander, i’m hoping it’s KC vs Baltimore in the super bowl. That would be amazing 🎉
Walking foot ball game??  Now THAT is a charity event that would bring in the bucks!!
Next time just change your shirt on camera, Trav. Feel free to do the same, Jason. 😘
I love how your dog is is sleeping in the chair in the back ❤
Jason there is nothing better than a fountain soda. Wawa has the best fountain sodas
I think that Jason and Travis should either coach or get into broadcasting the games.  They both know so friggin' much about football.
That’s right Jason, it’s called POP! Yell it from the rooftop!
You actually wore something other than scandals!!! Good job Jason!!
As a Lions fan since the days of Barry Sanders. I'm hoping Debo is back for the 49ers. If we win I don't want any excuse. I wore number 20 in high school till the day I tore my pitilar tendon ended my run.
I have never felt so in tune with you T. Kelce I haven't had a cherry Pepsi since I was a kid and could mix my own at the Chuck-a-Burger in St.  Louis county!!
Here as a Buffalo fan and a Taylor fan !
Are we sure, Travis’ nickname is Big Yeti? Because Jason being shirtless is questioning it. The guy is just as hairy as his brother. Plus I highly doubt this would happen but they should have Kylie and Taylor on a Valentine’s Day podcast.
Strawberry jam on those McMuffins lol
Jason and Travis made NFL alive!
WILD CHERRY PEPSI!!!!!!❤❤❤
At the 20:48 mark, that looks IG influencer Justin Danger Nunley & his son! (on the right)
Sometimes it’s cheaper ordering separate than combo’s
Kelce’s best quality is how they build everyone up. Much respect for how you talk about other players and opponent fan bases.
Follow the trail!! Haven't heard that in a minute!!!😂
the way jason talks about wanting his shirt off all day lmao
ugly outfit to me trav
I can’t drink anything with cherry flavor. Had a killer night drinking back in high school and I was just hammered. My best friend though I should try a cherry 7-up when we got back to her parents house. Turns out I loathe cherry flavored pop or drinks. I drank it and promptly threw up my guts out. It was brutal. Perhaps I threw up from all the liquor and beer I downed. But that cherry 7-up took the full blame for that night out and every other night out drinking. I did not blame the booze. Just the smell of cherry in any drink and I equate with projectile vomiting. 😂😂😂😂
Travis, every other word doesn't have to be F#*k......please!
Greatest podcast on earth 🌏!!!
I love cherry Pepsi
I’m absolutely with Jason on the McDonald’s meals. I will order à la cart all the time. You’re throwing your money away on fries and drink. Not worth it!
OMG Just realized that Jason is Yukon Cornelius come to life!!😮
You are going viral today!! So many new subscribers in one day!!
Instead of Diners, Drive ins, and Dives you guys could do a tailgating show highlighting traditions bars etc
Snows out, tits out 😂😂😂😂
MaAuto
You guys are awesome. Good luck Travis.  Jason I was a center in high-school. Wild man here. Voted biggest party animal in school. Not proud. No drugs.  Confuses me. Just drinking. You at Buffalo. I laughed and cheered. Brought me back!   Stay young!!
Alright guys hear me out this is a million dollar idea!!   The year Trav retires shoot a pilot episode for a new tv show called Kelce Gate names kinda buns but it’s a football reference.   The premise of the show would be crazy tail gating at all 32 teams  detailing all the different experiences at each stadium
Best episode EVER!!!!! Jason totally brought it!!! Hoping KC makes it to the Superbowl!
Did I see the Kelce brothers on the cover of a magazine today at the grocery store?
The bear and the otter.
Just wanted to let you guys know I really appreciate your podcast. I was recently diagnosed with cancer and it's gonna be an uphill battle. Your brotherly banter and stories cheer me up.  Thank you, and may God bless you and your family 🙏
Man is this a football podcast or a comedy podcast? 😂😂 I find myself laughing out loud watching this podcast sometimes more than the comedy podcasts!
Jason & Travis, Just recently subscribed to your podcast. Wanted to say you 2 are the very best siblings I've ever come across! And your brotherly love is fantastic👏🎉 Good luck in all your future plans. Your family is lovely♥️ Travis, may you and Taylor have a very long and happy relationship (you look great together)  Jason, Kylie is a beauty. Hugs to you all🤗
Not enough calories per dollar 😂😂😂
I like the longer beard on Travis because it’s a reminder “we’re here to win a football game not a beauty pageant”🅱️
The Sausage and Egg McMuffin is the best.
Will you both be at the Super Bowl?
Snows out! Tits out! Miss those days!
McD's has a special recipe CocaCola!
Oh Trav 🤣😂🤣😂 that's the big Yetti 😁 coming out 😁🤣🤣🤣❤️💛
Jason talking about 'calories on the dollar' at McDonald's is the most peak dad dadding i've ever heard lolol
Just noticed the cute dog sleeping in the background
Nothing like a cold fountain coke.
Travis waited so long to say we got to talk about it to Jason 😂😂😂😂😂
C'mon Jason, you gotta get that hashbrown dude. Besides the Mcgriddle, it's the best breakfast item @ Mickey D's!!
Will youvm both ne at Suprr Bpwl
The doggie in the back <3
Travis…. You mean Cherry coke don’t you?  Taylor is a huge Coke girl!
It’s the Accelerator Cherry Limeade for me. Thanks for the turn on. It’s the best!
Awee Jason dog in the background so cute
New Heights is on my list along with Games With Names. This group of NFL guys have the most personalities this league has ever had.
Your laughters is contagious.Amazing brothers.
Is there anything better than Travis' laugh?!  ha ha ha
Look at Jason’s dog on the couch! It hasn’t moved! Lol! 🥰🐶
always listen on spotify but this week IM WATCHING!!!
You guys are the best! I love the way you speak highly of all players in the game! Chiefs Kingdom!!! Jason, love your shirtless activities at the last game. I did the same at last year's Chiefs /Jags 27-20 game .
Theirs none better than a fountain soda, especially a McDonald’s Coke 😭 I literally drive to McDonald’s just for a soda
Could you imagine once Jason and Travis retire - they continue the New Heights podcast by recapping the games they tailgate every week. AMAZING!
Dang it Travis .. ya could have given  us lady fans a little chest peek.. lol  with that shirt change .. lol we already have Jason’s chest !
When is the Taylor Swift episode dropping
Harbaugh going Ted Lasso - lol
My thermostats didn't regulate to the temperature! They never got there! Jason for President!
Coke or Pepsi, the new Kelce controversy!
Lions could've only clocked the game if they didn't call a timeout. If we snapped properly and they called a timeout they had maybe 10secs left on 4thdown
1m views in 7 hours. These boys are going to be killing it with the podcast advert placement
Wow.. Jason didn’t return an opinion on Taylor when Travis said she absolutely loved Jason. … kind of cold. But ok
Hashbrowns for the win!!
It's hilarious that Jason is so pumped up about bills Mafia but not the fact that Travis won 😂😂😂
That Dog ever move?
Travis there is a hand stitched customized jacket that has been going around TikTok that someone made for you and they sent it to the stadium!!!!!!! Please don’t toss that! The creator spend so much time making it for you!!!
Jason’s dog sleeping on the couch in the background is priceless.😁
Retirement plan= tailgate all the games, record it for our viewing pleasure!! 😂
Has either brother ever been to the others AFC/NFC championship game?
Hi Travis, please stop cussing so much.small children that love you and Taylor,and all the Kelce family!❤
Your mom was like “that’s my boy”!! Your dad was like “he takes after mom”.
Hey go to Sonic and get a cherry vanilla Dr pepper rt 44 size
43:42 #LMAO
I agree; never get the combo.
If Travis scores he has to do the Harbaugh Whip! 😅
was jason being for real when he said what’s a cookie cake ? 😭
The Kelces need their own reality show!!!!
Can't wait for a Tom Brady episode
I love you guys,  but.... does Travis have to use the "f" word in every sentence?? There are other adjectives,  ya know! Expand your vocabulary!!  I say this with love!❤
I just absolutely love this show.  Best show ever!  Loved seeing Jason having fun at the Chiefs - Bills game!  Oooh I love Wild Cherry Pepsi!
I thought it was cool,  that you sat under Marv Levy's name. Ex Chiefs coach that was fired and took Buffalo to 4  straight Superbowls. He would have been the coach that got passed at the players that were buzzed. Lol
Two bros. Two personalities. One love...Ia am a fan from Indonesia
We need a NewHeightshow shirt of Jason with his shirt off….EPIC!!!!
Love Jason’s pup in the back, belly up and snoozing 🐾💤
As a Bills fan, want to apologize for those idiots that went beyond what is appropriate Travis, you guys brought it once again. I support my team through it all but theres good and bad fans everywhere. Much respect, good luck, 1st time watching you guys, hilarious! Great, guess i like the Kelce bros now lol
Not now or anytime soon lol but whenever u retire u have to go back and tail gate at Philly!! That should be ur first stop of course!!
A little bummed they didn't share the side by side images of Taylor and Jason as compared to Hermey and Yukon Cornelius in "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."
Karma wind....missed field goal...
McDonald's coke hits different!
Hash browns are the best thing at McDonald - but yes it is expensive for 2 bites of potatoes 😂
Sausage McMuffin egg and cheese, BUT have them substitute the round egg for a folded egg. Is the best order at McDonald’s.
When I see Jason shirt-less and screaming, all I can think of is "Yukon Cornelius" from Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer! So cool
We can’t get accelerator in the uk 🇬🇧 😭😢😢😢
Jason - In retirement please do a documentary show where  you go to each NFL team and show us the different tailgating traditions. I think it would be amazing!
McDonald’s we need the Jason Kelce meal on the menu. I want to pull up the window and order that and they know what’s up.
Honestly the best podcast out right now and it's not even close!!
Kelce Brothers Tailgating Retirement Tour Shirts NEED TO BE MADE!
Jason, that was cool how you showed that little girl Taylor.  I bet she will never forget that.💝. You guys are such good sports!
Fun fact for McDonald’s coke at least is its kept in a metal like cylinder(best way to describe it ) so the chemicals in cokes formula react different then when it’s in a normal bib at like a gas station so that’s why it tastes better at mcdonalds
Sausage, Egg & Cheese McMuffin is thee go-to breakfast from Mikey D's! I don't do 2 of those, but I will for the hash browns.  😋 Jason is also my spirit animal when it comes to partying for football games, lol! Love the brotherly love between you two, keep up the awesome work, love the podcast!
Jason needs to drop a hash brown in between those breakfast sandwiches. Game changer.
Yes, travel, wild cherry Pepsi is legit!
Naw the hash browns are on another level
Not Justin Nunley making an appearance in the pics!!
Bottlegate.....the Browns "caught" a pass on 4th down for a 1st down...they ran another play then went back and reviewed the previous play.......It was Dime a beer night some former big time news anchor was in college at the time and had the quoylte I went to the game and had a good time
Jason Kelce is a national treasure 😂
Why is Jason not verified on twitter or any social media. #verifyjasonK
*travis.....next weeks game take Malic acid and PQQ supplement will give you lots of energy for the game....I want you to win for Taylor and advance into superbowl*
When is Taylor going to be a guest on this show
Bills Mafia Compadres! 😅😂❤!!!! Looove you guys!
It was the Whats My Age Again video where the band was streaking
@travis, jason brings new meaning to “LeTitsNow” 😂
Kylie: “Jason, be on your best behaviour!” Jason: “Beast behaviour? got it!”
#NoDumbQuestions what do we need to do to get some Kylie merch???
the baltimore coach gives strong kendall roy rap vibes lmfao
8:42 Travis laugh is like an old school reliable truck starting up 😂😂😂
Peyton Manning should produce a New Heights "tailgating" series
I thought for sure Jason would mention something about meeting Taylor and how she and Kylie got along. Travis barely mumbled, "Tay said she loved you." What are we afraid of pissing off a few Chads dads and Brads by talking about Taylor?
Jason Kelce not knowing what a cookie cake is is a tragedy…
I dont care what anyone says, Baltimore tailgate is the absolute best and it will be absolutely INSANE! So exciting!
Hey guys!  Will there be a season three of New Heights - if Jason retires from the Eagles?  I have a new love of football based on your discussions and watching he games.
Jason needs to coach little girls football!!!!!!
Excellent episode.  Definitely need to have Kylie on to discuss her side of the game antics.  Let's go Chiefs kick some Raven ass!
Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gigundous Bills fan here, and I can't help but like this pod :)
That Green Bay game that missed kick was on the Long snapper and holder.  The holders hand was on the side of the ball.  Yet the kicker gets killed for it.
A correction: INTERnational news, all what you Kelce brothers do is international now. 😂 #alrightnah
As a life long Washington fan. The worst is indeed the commanders
54:00 -  Series: "The New Heights Tailgate Tour". Starts the season after Travis retires. So, not any time soon?
I want to see Bert on the podcast
Dr Pepper > cherry Pepsi any day of the week and twice on Sunday
Mc Donald's, we need a Jason Kelce celebrity meal box!
Don't knock the Sausage, Egg and Cheese McMuffin. Breakfast of champions. Good on you, Jason!
we need to hear the kylie whistle 🤣
McDonald's coke is THE BEST!!
Gotta get the fries and the hash browns!
Jason went to one of our tailgates and already knows the bills are the best tailgaters 🤣
Yahoo ....  you guys are so special.  Loved the Buffalo game..
The movie theater cherry coke!! I'm glad I'm not the only one who loves that.
Once trailer trash always trailer trash ,, Trailer Trash bros here are a classic case
Don't wake up the pup❤
Snow all around just put the fire on it lol. 😂
Omg, hilarious🙂
Shoutout Baloo or Winnie laying in the background!
Loved that Jason and all were having so much fun !
I love watching the interactions of these two!  They are truly special!  I'm a new watcher, but am a big fan!
Calories per dollar!!!😂😂😂
I thought he was heartin and blow in a kiss to tswift 😂
Also I laughed at Tony Romo, Sport anchor.  He said”Taylor’s brother in law”.  It’s not Tony’s first time.
They were extremely disrespectful. Burning Taylor cut outs and some shitty ass signs as if she was physically playing in the game 🤣 SMH grown men too
McGriddles are the shit. Sorry Jason
I have an old video of my husband when his sweater caught a small flame (without incident :)) and he screamed with such a high pitch 🤣 it still makes me LOL
Travis got it right. Mcdonalds hashbrown is best item, and Cherry Pepsi is pristine
I love these guys!! ❤
As a Bills fan I HATE that I love these two guys!
Eileen’s colossal cookies is delic!!
This episode did not disappoint!  Let's go Chiefs!
Kylie whistling for Jason 😂
Anybody else distracted by Jason's dog crashed out on the couch behind him?  On its back all sprawled out living his best life.
Travis needs to shave ngl
Love U Jason 💚🏈💚😁 Chiefs Kingdom ❤️💛 Your brother loves you Trav 🫶❤️💛😊 so much that he lost his shirt 👕 hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Jason if doesn’t run for president this will be a fuckin waste”
The bottle throwing is the reason you still can’t get a bottle cap at most stadium events because an uncapped bottle theoretically empties when thrown
was cracking up ''thats how you get the better deal''
Travis looking like Brendan Frazier from bedazzled.
As a Niners fan I don't think I'm gonna be sad if they lose to the Lions because what a great story, what a great year, what a great city, etc!  But still, go Niners!  Dream Super Bowl?  SF v KC (my number one and number two teams!!).
Travis's laugh is so contagious I absolutely love these two ❤
Massive shout out to Jason for picking up that little girl so she could show her sign to Taylor, and making her dream come true.
McDonald's black hot coffee is the BEST 👌
Just love listening to these guys because they are real! They were also raised to be good, hardworking and respectful people.
I’m so glad I found this podcast!!! I’m really enjoying it!!! Looking forward to the next podcast!!!!
Yall had me at wild cherry Pepsi❤ 🍒 ❤️🍒❤️
Hahahahahaha! 😆😆😆😆 You guys are the best. Nobody laughs and enjoys life better than the Kelce brothers. That was such a fun game to watch. From the great game to the Bills mafia giving KC players a hard time, to Jason’s shenanigans. It truly was the best entertainment. Cheers boys
Add the hash brown to the McMuffin, its life altering.
i need a eagles kelce jersey signed im a delaware native die hard eagles fan!!!!!!!! KELCE COME BACK!!!
T swifty
Jason was absolutely the best jumping out the window!!!  Go  Chiefs 🎉
All I'm saying is if Jason ran for mayor in Philly, he would probably win. 🦅
Jason needs to do an NFL tailgate tour and report back!! Gaurentee it's Gillete... weather we're winners or losers🤣
No I am with Jason I worked at McDonald's  for ten years  only  cheeseburger  and small drink  enjoy watching your channel
The best part of this is watching Jason's dog on the couch behind him!
Jasons dog chilling on the sofa is our spirit animal
Travis I am currently painting a combo of you and Jason I'll send it to you when it's done
We need kylies reaction in her own words 😂😂
I love that y’all love cherry cokes. They are the best!
they should be on vacation after sunday tho, final game
Trav is a real leader for taking the blame for the hardman fumble 💯💯
I can say, as a North Carolinian, native to the BIRTHPLACE OF PEPSI…the is still nothing better than a fountain COKE!
You guys shoudl bring Taylor on the show
Such a good episode!!! Gosh I love these dudes. 🫶🏽🫶🏽
What kinda dirty ass wall is the overall background? I can't top looking at it.
Does Jason (no-combo) Kelce allow kids meals for his girls?
Whoa! No McDonald's fries!? BLASPHEMY!!!
Watching the replays of that Hardman fumble I was telling my wife that if Travis would have got a better block on that dude he wouldn’t have been there to force that fumble. Cool to see that Travis acknowledged that also.
Travis...about getting that painting done...one name comes to mind - Devon Rodriguez in NYC.  Devon would make that painting look like the photo - the dude is that good!
I already know the creative af swifties are painting that portrait of Jason 🤣🤣
All of the episodes are good but this one was soooo funny! I listen to these as a mental break between work.
YES TRAVIS!! wild cherry pepsi is the GOAT!!!
Travis defending Mecole was such a class act even though Mecole fumbled twice in the game so he was totally at fault both times
Travis....have an unbiased party smell your wet armpiits...then the candle....and see if the scents are even close.
my favorite laughing duo :)
"Dad's boobs are showing" 😂😂😂😂
Hey, you can only go up from the bottom.  Set that bar really low.
So McDonalds gets their coke in steel cannisters instead of the boxed bibs in plastic bags.   Gives it a fresher taste
Jason was a whole vibe Sunday! the one picture of Jason without a shirt roaring out the window of the suite u can kinda see Kylie in the background and she was kinda cracking a smile BUT u already know what she was thinking 😂😂😂  and the texts about his boobs being out was the icing on the cake!! Jason is the definition of Yolo!
OG Swiftie here…I would like to say I came to the podcast, several months ago, for obvious reasons, but I STAY every week for Jason! Also, there is ALWAYS that slim chance we get to see Kylie, and I vow to listen to every SECOND of this podcast from now till forever…as long as there is the promise that Kylie might pop in! LOVE HER!   Also…get the damn cat, Jason. That girl has EARNED IT! You know…after that whole “shark thing”… 😂
Jason I never get combos it's a trap! Get the al la cart and add the fries 😂
I’m with Travis Wild Cherry Pepsi is the best
#BillsMafia fan over this way this podcast is amazing though. yall are hilarious and keep it real. cant help but enjoy it
I never miss this podcast. I watch expecting humorous, yet intelligent segments about football and come away with obscure passionate analyses I never knew I needed...like combo meals, what is/isn't a sandwich, or whether straws have one or two holes.
there is a guy in philly that has a bar and host every game for friends and neighbors and the news and other broadcast have talked to him you should find out and go to his place for a surprise
Awesome episode!
Please feel free to send a signed shirt over to the uk 🥰
McDonald’s coke just hits different 😂
This podcast brought to you by pfizer
Travis you on point with that wild cherry Pepsi
damn right its POP
WTH is Travis doing that he's sweating up his shirt like that? My God he's sitting at a desk talking on a podcast...
Yes the best Coca Cola is from McDonalds!!
I hope this isn’t a dumb question: when you’re on the sideline during the game how closely do you watch/follow the game?
You guys are great.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  Lovin it!  😂
"I wouldn't even know where to begin to explain the love that you guys have for each other, your family, and your fans. Your hearts are so big, and what would we do if we didn't get to hear your weekly banter? 😊 When the season ends, I hope you continue to put out a podcast, maybe once a month, just to keep us all updated on all the excitement that's going on in your family's lives. 💥 I wish for Travis and Taylor to be together forever and ever. ❤ She is such a ray of sunshine, and she has such a heart of gold. 🌞 It is so genuine, it's unreal. 😮 As a mother watching her, I can see where her mother would be so, so proud. 👍 She's a great girl, talented, smart, and genuine. I should write a short story. LOL. 😂
Jason saying “I wanna make my best first impression, this is my best chance” reminds of that videoclip of little Wyatt saying “I gotta do my singing, I gotta dance” and Kylie just accepts it 😂 😂
I have watched the video of Jason jumping out of the box window and yelling a thousand times, and die laughing EVERY TIME! I LOVE how much fun he is having!
Jason needs to run for office and also hello Kylie kelce First Lady love it
I love Jason but he's dead wrong about McDonalds hashbrowns
Good talk!!!!    Jason looks rested.
I laughed last Sunday. I like beer shirtless Jason because he is so cool Big Yeti after Travis scored.  I can’t wait to watch you both there this coming Sunday.   Go Chiefs Go!
...What the dog doin..😂
Best game ever!   Shout out to Kylie for being the best wife ever!  Looking forward to Sunday's game!  Go Chiefs!!!
You guys should come to the Indy 500 and tailgate!!
watching the podcast and working on the New York Times puzzle Spelling Bee. The pangram for the puzzle (uses all letters) was eluding me until I started listening and here it is: PARANOID. Don't really know what to think about this....
Always love this podcast.  Really liked how Jason supported his brother during the win against the Bills.  I hated how the Bills defense sucked during most of the game against Kansas City.  The Bills deserved to lose this game because of it.  Josh played his ass off and deserved a better fate.
Travis I have the same issue! Only under my armpits I sweat hahaha
#teamfountaincoke as well here!
I could imagine jason kelce ordering at mcdonalds "yeah uhh can I get uhh double quarter pounder w/cheese no pickles please. An order of large fries. And a large coke..."  - Jason Kelce "sir do you just want the number 8 combo?"  "Na, fuck that." - Jason kelce
I am begging from all of us to please podcast every Wednesday still after football season.
Huge Bills fan. He saying about the stadium being in a suburb. Yes, it is. Then People charge $25-$50 to park on their lawns.
Another heartbreaker for the Bills
Jason please come to baltimore!
I am with Jason, I don't do combo meals at fast food because I am trying to eliminate pop from my life. I order just the burger.
No they ran another play and then went back and called the penalty.
56:45  Jason’s not lying!  I’m a SF fan, lived in CT for 23 years, so it wasn’t like there was much opportunity to see them. Friend got us tickets to go see them in Buffalo back in.. 08ish.. both teams sucked, was a 3-0 final, a blizzard was coming in and it was sleeting.. had THE BEST TIME. Bills Mafia were so much fun! Totally welcomed me in, didn’t come across anyone being mean spirited. Got wasted and attempted(succeeding too!) to get up this steep mud hill just outside the stadium that people were trying to get up but kept sliding back down.  It was SUCH a good time. 10/10 Recommend!  Ever since, the Bills are my fav AFC team(didn’t hurt that I hated all things Patriots too 😅)
Is it wrong for me to wish Kylie was on here to hear what her opinion was on the whole thing!  Me, shouting, Kylie, Kylie, Kylie 😂 Listening to your podcast is my comic release coming home from work today I love it!
He said they don’t hate us I was with them 😂😂😂😂
I am a woman pushing 60 years old that just learned about what football is all about watching the Chiefs.  Taylor and Travis is getting credit for the sudden interest in football. Jason and Travis you are hilarious I have never laughed so much in my life as I have watching this podcast.
You can still get bottles at stadiums, but the caps have to be removed so the bottle can’t be turned into a projectile. Apparently releasing the carbonation, the less impactful the bottle will be if thrown. Cans also have to be cracked before handed to the patron.
Travis will you sign my rookie card of you? ☺ I'll make you a home cooked meal and  you can bring Taylor too.
Hey Kylie, we always say, "it's funny when it's not yours!"  I'm sorry it was yours this time!   LOL  We all enjoyed it, if that makes you feel any better! <3
sausage egg and cheese mcmuffin is goated
I would like to know what inspired Jason when he picked up those girls.  Such a sweet moment! ❤❤❤❤ ***as a mom a tiny part of me was like OMG drunk naked man took my kid 😂
“You don’t do hashbrowns?! Dude WTF is wrong with you?!!” 😂😂😂
Travis pregame fit was giving an Ernie vibe from Bert & Ernie Sesame Street 😊
I wonder are you selling shirtless Jason with beer bobhead, aren’t you.
Jason Kelce  MVP - Most Valuable Partier!!!🎉🎉🎉
Love Jason’s knowledge of Disney stuff ❤
"Spoken like a political man" are you eyeing a political position Congressional or Senate seat? I personally would like to see you dominate that arena…. once you’re done with football. 😂
WHOOHOO GO CHIEFS!!! GO GET THAT "W"
Smart to get McDonald’s commercial
Best episode ever!! I was at the game and loved every minute of it!  Go Chiefs!!!
Snows out tits out!!!!😂
Travis, looking like the early 70’s!! Yay
I’d choke on my popcorn if I saw a Travis Kelce cameo in a Wes Anderson flick.
Double quarter pounder made like Mac
The Mcdonalds coke with the McMuffin slaps though - if you find yourself in that ~10am window where you really want an early cheeseburger, subbing that for the coffee is a move.
HAHAHAHAHA...snows out, tits out!!! 😂😂 I can't with these two!!
Omg!! U guys HAVE to do a tailgating series!!!😅😂😅😂😅
It’s electric baby!!
Bro Travis' genuine shock/concern in that "No hashbrown???" had me dying 😂
Love you guys a bunch and enjoy your show. But can we chill on the "F- bombs?" It's just unnecessary, and kids are watching. Just a suggestion.
Two sausage, egg & cheese McMuffin is the ultimate in breakfast deliciousness!!
As a lifelong member of the Bills Mafia, 3rd Generation, and being named after a famous Buffalo Bills Quarterback (Jamie = Jim Kelly), I would like to offer Jason Kelce an honorary membership into The Family. We abso-fucking-lutely adore you, and need you back for way more games. I live in South Buffalo, which sounds a lot like where you guys were raised! Your podcast and brotherly love just makes me feel so happy, and you guys remind me of all of the friends and family I grew up with. Seriously, you guys are awesome. I’m actually pretty upset that you were down the street in a legendary Buffalo Bar, and I missed the opportunity to be sharing a drink with Kylie and Jason Kelce! Lmaooo!   In all seriousness, I was super happy to see Taylor supporting Travis, and I love watching him be just the nicest gentleman to her. Travis, thank you for showing the public being a kind gentleman to your woman instead of hiding her and making things awkward is ACTUALLY COOL TO DO! It makes my Momma Soul so happy. My daughter and my boys can look up to something positive for once!   I was so excited to see Kylie, Taylor, Papa Kelce, and especially Momma Kelce there! Momma Kelce is definitely low key my hero.   I know it’s a long shot that you guys may read this, but this podcast every week gives me life every week. Something to smile about. It’s like watching my cousins joke about stuff that happened when we were growing up, which warms my heart. Hearing you guys talk about my city and my team with so much love just became my new favorite episode.   Life’s tough these days. The Kelce Fam makes it a little better. Thanks guys.   And I may not be rooting particularly for KC, but I’ll always root for Travis Kelce! Good luck on the next game Big Yeti! But when you come back to Buffalo, I hope our team kicks your ass 😂😂😂 😎❤️🤍💙❄️   Thank you Kelce’s!!! 🎉
Jason can you do this podcast shirt less next week...... 😅🎉
Making football fun again! Thank you!
Pop funko made shirtless jason
Try the steak egg and cheese bagel
The fact that Jason and Travis like Leon Phelps is priceless.
1:00:00 🤣🤣🤣 I knew kylie was a swiftie!!!
Seven tour afghan vet love you both.  Keep up the good work
Travis you need to botox those pitts.
Jason is spot on to skip that grease soaked potato sponge they call a hash brown. And yet I can’t leave there without one
Their bracket makes me imagine what if week 16 and week 17 in the nfl were college basketball style march madness where the worst team in your division plays the best team and that determines who makes the playoffs
The game I remember was Dallas at Minnesota and a ref got hit by a beer bottle.
PLASTIC OR CUPS ONLY BABY!! 😂
Eagles and ravens for me
I heard you and your wife are expecting again Jason,  from the looks of your belly at Trav's game you must be about 3 months!
Can we please get the chiefs to sign Jason as full back !!
Jason kelce charm 😂
40:36 i think this is the reason they always take the tops off bottles at stadiums so if you do throw it the liquid should hopefully spill out before it hurts someone
*shows 2 page hand written note by a fan* Jason: “holy fuckin….nice”
travis “nice…. nice….. awe nice….. holy fucking nice”😂😂😂
Jason, you get it!!!  It is all about the fans, and giving respectful fans a minute of your time or doing them a favor is what it is all about!  Daniella and that little girl at the game, will remember a cherished moment with you for a lifetime.  Keep it going!
Awh I live in Erie. It's magical. Have yall ever been to Presque Isle? Waldameer? It's a great weekend visit. Alright now 😂
"How could you not have fun in a snowball fight." Always love the energy these guys bring.
Jason, you are just amazing!
Mac Donalds coke is closer to the original recipe
He ain’t lying bout that McMuffin 😂😂
Trav is sweating his ass off so then changes into a Hoodie?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cincy Shirts printed a shirt that very night
Jason here vs at the game is crazy 😂 he transformed
If Jason runs for president I'm voting for him!!
OMG  best and most favorite episode everrrrr!!
Marv levy!
Can we please get the hoodie in the Kelly green color :)
My no dumb question was asked loved the extra info they gave us on the pro bowl since lots of us are still learning
I don’t do combo meals. Same Jason, same. Best item only please.
Love you guys enough to say maybe use a lint-roller on your mics 🫶🏽
Travis as a Baltimorean we are so excited to have ya’ll here and we’ve been showing nothing but love to Taylor and the Kelce family
Seeing Jason like this during the broadcast was Anwar amazing another legendary moment for Jason.  Love the Blink-182 reference Travis, however it was the What's My Age Again video when they were all complete nude.
That picture with the lady is soo cute 🤍🤍🤍
😛😎😲😳👍
Wild cherry Pepsi & cherry coke are superior
Whenever Taylor Swift joins the Podcast….. it will break the internet.  I think they know this 😂
Ya’ll are coming to my hood! Can’t wait for this game. ❤💜
No dumb question: did Travis’s shirt get ruined because of the sweat stain?
We need Kylies POV of Jason in the bonus episode!!
3:31 est.. I absolutely love you guys, however, for some reason I don’t like when Travis uses the F word constantly.  Don’t ask me why, because I use it too.  Just maybe calm it down a little.  Trust me it’s one of everyone’s favorite words, but maybe using it all the time, makes it not as meaningful.  Ha ha

LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU TWO BROTHERS... YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE FIRE BACK TO ME FOR FOOTBALL, AND LOVE THE PODCAST!!!
the field goal miss from greenbay is what lost the game for them forsure
His pregame fit designed by Teddy Ruckspin 🧸🐻
I'm thinking a McDonald's Jason Kelce breakfast un-combo😂 these two crack me up!!
I listen to all these sponsor ads.  Are you guys aware that on the audio podcast Tampax has a very odd tampon add targeting new tampon users (that would be teenage girls!) that precedes your podcast.  Your new market?
Always wear a T-shirt under your shirt. No more pitting out when you do that.
This guy (Jason) is priceless, and their timing is perfect....I love watching them...
McD’s has the BEST coke by efforts!  They hyper-carbonate it, run cooling lines so it’s super cold, and clean the machine with filtered water. It’s really the best coke you can order.
❤❤❤ JTK
Love these 2 I would want a jersey from both of them shout to you both from Oklahoma
Jason Kelce for PRESIDENT!!! Dude - I would vote for you-
Absolutely love you guys!  Hyping up the Bills Mafia like no other!  Much respect!
I would love to hear Kylie's side .
Robert Griffin III talks like the lady’s man!
Jason forgot a shirt for Jason!   🤣
Jason’s dog snoozing in the background 😍
You two had me laughing so hard with you. It's great seeing Jason laughing.  I think going to the game and having a great time took a lot of pressure off him. Tell Kylie not to worry. I think Taylor had a great time. Jason, I think you took all the attention of Taylor, and she got to enjoy herself. Great game Travis  and to the Chiefs. Chiefs kingdom made me fall in love with football. I know people get tired of talking about the Chiefs.
Bro you need to give Danielle a free signed jersey
Pretty strange reaction from Travis considering him and his girlfriend trashed half the voting public on social media?
Is Intern Brandon actually Baker Mayfield?
Please don’t promote McD’s. Not real food. So bad for your arteries.
Travis was cracked up when Jason told him about Kylie telling him to be on his best behavior 59:52  😂😂😂😂😂😂
I found it on YouTube.  Tim Couch faked a spike and then did spike. By rule, you have to spike it on first attempt otherwise it’s intentional grounding.  Yeah, browns fans didn’t like it but it’s the correct call
They have t-shirts already made with Jason shirtless (and half hairless) on it.
Hear me out........nightcap x new heights crossover. Shit would be wild
@new heights Travis can have my kelly Green Kelce jersey its a vapor fuse tags still on it never worn. I was holding on to it to get it signed, but Jason is too popular chances of getting it signed are rare.
EXCUSE ME JASON HASHBROWNS ARE DELICIOUS
I had no idea your pits sweat when you're dehydrated lmao
Great stuff Lads.  Now that the Birds are out, I'm rooting for KillaTrav and Big Red.
The ace ventura deep cut .like a glovveee love it
UC🙌🏿🙌🏿🔥🔥
poor kylie with the clutter. no wonder he could not find his super bowl trophy or was it his ring in the documentary anyway… This would drive me crazy 11:51
New Heights Tailgate across America!!!  I am here for it!!
You are SOOO right! Cherry Pepsi!! OMG BTW:  WHEN YOU GETTING A CAT??? teehee .....
First impression is accurate! What’s wrong with that????? Nothing. Nothing at all.
Bottle-Gate. Quincy Morgan caught the ball. The refs placed it and the Browns ran to the line and got the play off. After the play, the refs went back and reviewed the Morgan caught and negated the catch. Refs cheated the Browns and the fans were sick of it.
i’m actually surprised jason eats so much mcdonald. i get he needs to keep weight on, but that shit is so unhealthy. there are other ways. good fats. don’t they have nutritionists on the eagles?   anyway, not my business what he decides to put in his body. it’s his body.   he’s so awesome though. my thinking is that taylor felt more at ease because of jason. that she was not center of attention at the game. it’s getting worse in there a of more haters and opposing teams. agin, i’m assuming how taylor feels and i have no idea what she feels.   i just love her. ❤
J Kelce retirement season with Trav in Buffalo someday please 🙏🙏 The Super Kelce Bros w/ Josh Allen would be way more fun than "Mahomes and Mahauto" #BillsMafia You guys rock and need to play a season on the same team. 🙏🦬
who needs a Travis cancle when they can make HIS REALPIT SHIRT SCENT!  Bottle those Pheromnes Please!
For the context of the beer bottle game:  It was a big game with big playoff implications. Late in the fourth down only 1 score the browns were driving. The refs I believe missed a call against the browns as they were driving, and then they ran the next play.  But, then the refs got together and decided to review THEY PLAY BEFORE THE LAST PLAY RAN! And, THEY OVERTURNED IT! Meaning, they effectively erased a play that had happened in order to screw the browns.   So the fans erupted and started throwing things on the field. The refs felt the threat of injury to players or staff was too dangerous, so with time on the clock still they called the game with the final score as is. I even think the browns still had the ball when the game ended with time left on the game clock.
I wanna see J and bert shirtless in Baltimore this sunday. I really want my SB LIV rematch
Loved all of it!!❤ Jason, celebrating, Kylie, Taylor, Mama Kelce, Pawps, it was truly epic ! 🎉❤😂  But I wouldn't be shouting out "Bills Mafia" .... They were awful to one , harmless, wonderful, beautiful and kind hearted young woman who didn't deserve any of that. And a picture, of Allen and Taylor that they put in her face. I have to say, it was ugly, and if I were @killatrav #killatrav , I wouldnt be impressed with these people, at all. Why can't she attend games to support her bf and not have to be chased by crazy folks with torches! You call it fun, I call it no class. I hope she stops attending, because I don't think she's safe. People are hating on her because of her loyalty to a man who just laughs and shouts out the bullies?! There are better ways for her to spend her time. She's doing all the sacrificing here. Great job Chiefs, not so great Bills... Have some class and respect .
Every single show gets better and better. LEGENDS!   Also, from the best tailgating team in the league here in Philadelphia, a huge shout out to Bills Mafia for what looked like a great party atmosphere last Sunday. Nice job! 👍🏼
mmmm The Z-Man.  Give me a thumbs if you know.  iykyk
Bill were playing 3rd string linebackers.
Saw a pic of Jason holding up a little member of Bills Mafia so they could say hi to Taylor. Man is a legend! ❤
Trav's game day fit is giving Burt and Ernie vibes. They're my faves. 😂
😂 again congratulations Chiefs on your Championship win on Sunday! Way to go guys! Shout out goes to the whole Chiefs team especially Mahomes 15 Kelce 87 Pacheco 10! With love ❤️ from the Sooner St from our hearts 💕 💞 ♥️ to yours! 😊
Cherry Pepsi.. WHAT IN THE WORLD.. Trav.. you've lost me
Get the sausage egg mcmuffins with scrambled eggs 🦾
The Kelce brothers putting the NFL on the map😂
Best episode yet!!!! Love it! ❤️
I love that MCD gets Jason Kelce's order wrong too
The tailgate thing could be a whole tv series! Where each episode you go to a different stadium, look at thier traditions,  try the different foods, etc.! Would def watch!!
How are we not talking more about the cookie cake commentary? treasure map and trails? omg 💀 😂😂😂😂
When Andy Reid has been your coach for your whole career Mahomes would be a failure it he was not successful. Baker has had 10 coaches in 4 years.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Travis just like me with those sweaty ass underarms 😂
I worked at a McDonald's in independence, MO and had Dante hall come through the drive thru. He signed an autograph. Unfortunately I wasn't working drive thru that day
Get Taylor on the show please 🥺🥺
This was most hilarious pod!!!😂😂
Dude, you guys are the best love watching your podcast
Jason for president!!! 🙌
the thought of jason doing the sports betting instead of intern is so funny to me him just screaming about his picks
I truly cant not say I have watched a football game and still never will but I love both of you together!
5:40 🏆
clevland fans used to throw dog bones at the broncos 😂
WOW!!!  she's the nicest!!!  she loves my greyhound and always gives him a dog biscuit when I drive through...
What will I do without New Heights during the off-season?? 😧
I can see a show in couple of years seeing the kelce brothers  tailgating every teammin NFL
Have you noticed how really neat Travis' space is? And rows of the canned drink he drinks...in a beverage cooler? I like it!
I can picture Kylie whistling to get Jason's attention! I love it! 😂
Is that the McDonalds in Broomall????????
Glad you had fun in Buffalo, Jason! You would make an AMAZING host of a travel show where you visit every NFL tailgate in the country. Make that a show. Please. We need it!
wild cherry pepsi with crown special reserve
I’m not hating here, but the reason that record got broken with Gronk is because Travis Kelce does catch the ball a little bit more
Feed the horse!
Hey Travis how is your new lapdog Tsy doing?  Woof woof!
McDonalds is the only chain that gets large canisters of coke. Their fountain coke is unique and not available anywhere else.
What a fun show!
I love this Podcast..thank you for the laugh  ❤
This is like a bad morning radio show and its glorious. Mostly.
That cherry Pepsi is no joke brother!
Jason, it’s not who gives you their fan picture.  It s about who you go home to…..  ❤Kylie so much.  She’s a class act.
Lions baby!!
Friends met at a bar are the best kind of friends
It wouldn’t be McDonalds if they got the order right 😂
He is fool Of course swifty loved it GO RAVENS
Looks like Dickerson has good taste in Bourbons!
Love the podcast guys. Keep up the great work
Hey I was thinking the same thing about Travis hand last week too.
From growing up watching the O’Shea brothers to being THE KELCE brothers. Unreal 😍 America’s favorite family.
Travis is sweating in a T-shirt so he puts on a hoodie? 😂
Washington “Star-Lords” are the worst.
You guys need to get the Winnipeg beer snake going on down there
As a St. Louisan I might just call you T-rav from now on
The difference in sweat from 27:11 to 27:23 is INSANELY. He needs to see a doctor.
Somebody get Travis in touch with Wes Anderson. That needs to happen!
McDonald’s Coke is better than any other fountain Coke. I don’t know what they do different but, it is the best. Unless, it’s a cherry Vanilla Coke from Sonic.
How was the suite vibe?? Wanted to hear what Ed and Donna thought of the shirtless appearance. Probably common for them. 😂
Do y'all know why the rivalry between the Cowboys and Eagles became as intense as it is today?  I'll tell you...because that stupid Eagles coach, Buddy Ryan was his name as I recall, all those many years ago put a BOUNTY on how many Cowboys the Eagles players could hurt in a game.  It was well documented.  No Cowboy fan has ever wanted to see the Eagles win a game anywhere since then and it is all because of stupid of stupid Buddy Ryan...or whatever his name was.  I believe that was his name.  Most Cowboy fans from back then don't tend to forget.  Sorry Jason...love you and your caring, especially the Christmas fund raiser, to pieces for all your volunteer work.  However, I will never be able to want the Eagles to win...but I felt terrible for you at the end of the season this year.  That is the story of the storied animosity between our two teams.  I hate it but it is what it is...blame the stupidist coach the Eagles ever had or ever will have.  And, I am a proud 92%er
Could it be modal cotton? LOL...Love your PC:)
Reminiscing Burt Reynolds on a bear skin rug. 🤔
I felt awful when Bills fans were throwing snowballs at Patrick. What the heck is the violence against the opposing team? He could have gotten hurt. Violence is never a positive response for sore losers
Lmao Travis pre game fit 100% looks like he works for Steve Zissou!! I would love to see him in a Wes Anderson movie i think Trav would kill it
I've always called a belly trail a  "happy trail"
I want to learn more about those games 🤓
Team Hashbrowns
oops 10 cent beer.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvjLTZnH48
There's no place like Buffalo. The people and food are amazing. It's truly the city of good neighbors.
indians game nickel beer night!!!!
Jason thought Travis was stepped on by stilettos😂😂
That was a Rugby League try (equivalent of touchdown) in the corner by a Winger!! Go Trav.. You should get on the field with the Rabbitohs in Las Vegas!
Prepare to Break the internet guys-y’all should have T Swift for a small guest 😉feature on the season finale. I’m not going to lie-I’m a Swiftie/Bama football fan that found my way over here. 😂I’ve been following the Podcast for weeks now-totally entertained! Y’all are great! So funny! Shout out to Kyleigh for the smiles/laughs @the game! What a good wife/sisnlaw..just letting everyone cut up and have a good time!
Sexiest man alive goes shirtless and broke the Internet...love it!💗
59:43 Best Behavior/First Impression Meeting Taylor
Jason should play one final season in Kansas City. I know his Philly heart may not take it but winning a Super Bowl together as brothers would be dope.
I love the positive vibe these 2 bring back to football!  It brought me back to it again!
Make it a goal to tour every stadiums tailgate for fun! 😋 the stories and memories you can create with fans and each other would be incredible. #92precentergoals
54:37 Hear me out: if Jason retires then the nfl show we need is Jason Kelce going to different tailgating before games to showcase tailgate traditions
Sausage egg and cheese mcmuffin is GOATED
Joe’s KC.  Get the gumbo.  Sooooo dang good.  Large brisket sandwich with fries and fountain coke.
We want Jason long term in Philly. Don’t care if he’s on the sidelines, in the front office or just halftime upside down keg-stands in center field.
I bet my friends that Travis would want to move to Buffalo.
Jason was white girl wasted! Holy!!
WE really need a Kelce/Kelce ticket for 2028!!!
Love the show, love your energy.
You two are electric.  Love your episodes and laugh the entire time. Hope to see you Jason in Baltimore with your large  personality. I am a Ravens girl but love New Heights. 🥳🎉🔥💜👿🖤🏈
For those interested in the backstory of the Browns bottlegate incident referenced here: In 2001, the Browns were 6-6 and fighting to try to make the playoffs for the 1st time since returning to the league in '99. Late in the season, they were playing the Jaguars in Cleveland and the Browns were trailing 15-10 late in the game with under 2 mins to go, but they were driving down the field and were in Jags territory. A 4th down came up and the Browns went for it and Couch hit Quincy Morgan for the 1st down. The Browns then rushed to the line and spiked the ball to stop the clock. However, the refs said they got notified before the spike that the booth wanted to review the 4th down pass to Morgan to see if he actually caught it and so they proceeded to review the play and overturned the call on the field and gave the ball to the Jags. The thing that pissed off the fans was the fact that another play had already been ran (the spike) and you're not allowed to go back two plays to review a previous play. The fans got rightfully pissed and started throwing beer bottles and debris on the field and at the refs. The refs called the game and got pelted as they ran into the tunnel.  Another note here: earlier that same season, the Browns were playing the Bears and had a lead late in the game with under 2 mins to go. The booth signaled they wanted to review a play but another play had already been run so the refs said by rule they couldn't go back to review the play that triggered the potential review. The reviews of said play showed that had they been allowed to review, the call would have went in the Browns favor and they probably hang onto win that game. They lost that game after giving up a TD, onside kick, a hail mary TD to tie the game in regulation (were up 14 with under 2 mins to go), and a tipped pass that went for a pick 6 in OT.   So basically, Browns were screwed by the refs in similar scenarios. 1 where they didn't allow the booth review of a previous play and 1 where they did allow it despite another play having been run.
How about Maauto?
I have never been a huge football fan but I love watching you guys and listening to your pod cast. You brotherhood is awesome your family is awesome and you guys are awesome. As you both are Cincinnati alumni and also buckeye boys I'll leave you with a O-H
Jason and Travis should do a show where they tour all the different stadiums and experience the different tailgating
Travis nailed it Cherry Pepsi the very Best
I’ve had a heck of a day at work and boy did I need this podcast!!   Y’all literally spreading pure joy and we love it!! 🎉
Kudos  to all the Bill's Mafia for partying hard with Jasoh Kelce...my kind of people!!!
With the aluminum bottles, they keep the caps.
Sending love from the Netherlands. We might not do American Football here, but I'm doing my best to learn 🤓
Sooo could we get an idea what y’all eat during the season and then after?!? Jason seemed so excited for soda 😂 Curious what y’all normally eat.
Travis- "you're getting knocked out. I respect that"
You guys are a  hoot/comedians.
Love these guys
Great podcast but I was a little disappointed that they didn’t address Jason helping the little girl to show her sign to her heroine, Taylor
So who eats the Happy Trail? Lol.
See Jason this is why you’re our favourite, Coke over Pepsi all day every day!
54:50 Kylie doesn't have to go to all of them...😂😂😂
If you watched all of Bass' PAT-Attempts and Field Goal Tries during that game you would see that every kick he performed, no matter what direction they were driving, would slice to the right. So I wasn't surprised that that final kick from the right hash with strong left to right winds went wide right. Even the ones he made were mostly in the right third of the goal posts.
McGriddle. THEEEE BEST!
So tell me about Buffalo?!?! Oh Travis now you’re going to get a shit ton of paintings of Jason sent to the stadium!!
Please make a new heights shirt of Jason hoppin out the suite! Cartoon style would be very cool… just saying 😏. Love you guys
You guys are hilarious!
I love these guys and both their teams and their podcast and their families however, I was so hoping that Jason said he went to beast mode seeing his brother making a touchdown and was overcome 🤷
This may be the most fun episode yet!!!! Nothing but good vibes! Love you guys
As a lifetime Browns fan, I am now fully behind KC!
Jason's dog asleep behind him. Love this.
Bottlegate. I was at that game it was about a play that went under review.
Mahomes the Tyler Rosette 🏵️
Thank you guys for making me laugh while at work while doing Taxes thanks
McDonalds fountain coke, nothing like it!
Who are the 92%er's??
Y’all are the Best !!!
When is the "Jason Kelce Shirt-off  Bills Mafia Playoff Party" Bobblehead going on sale? I'll take 6!
Jason how bout a kitty for Ky for valentines 💝
I agree with Travis….Jason for President!!!!
YES!!! POP baby….. Iowa love my dudes!
ya got it all wrong. you get 2 mc muffins and a hash brown, break the hash brown in half and put half on each sandy. ur welcome rookies.
keep your arms down Travis 😂
Chris Jones 😍😍😍 as Leon Phelps, the ladies man? YESSSSS!!!!!! “Say sweet lady, would you like a fish sandwich?” 😂❤😂
So bottlegate is how I was introduced to the Browns and it endeared the team to me. I was new to the triangle that is Pitts, Cleveland, Buffalo, and  wanted a regional team to root for that wasn't the Steelers. Bottles start flying and I could get behind that passionate fan base!
Jason is an absolute beauty. What a fun dude.
Best colinsworth line “now here’s a guy”
I like when Travis doesn’t bring up Taylor. But have to wonder what Travis thinks if Taylor
Omg! I was laughing Sunday at Jason but I laughed so hard at Jason and Travis talking about it! Lol
It’s coke not pop 🤣🤣🤣
Etsy is a sponsor. Love it!! Lol, who would have thought?! Lol, Jason & Travis talking about Etsy. 🎉🎉🎉
Jason is a beast. A funny beast.
How you have a couch and no tv in front of it.
Trav, you need Lume!  Put it all over them pits!😂
You know what’s not a Lebron Stat…… Pat to Trav  most TDs in playoff history. 🐐 🐐
Pop is correct!  Spoken like a true Northeastern Ohioan!  👍🏻👍🏻
Cheesecake Factory Bag!! I laughed out LOUD!! LOL Trav, you are da man! Go on with your bad self in your Cheesecake Factory shirt.  You make anything look good and you know we love ya here in the 816 & 913
Hey the Kelce pronunciation issue is a riot.  But you could be Sammy Hagar who just found out on "Finding Your Roots" TV show that he is 100% not a Hagar.  All this time and he finds out his DNA showed that he is not a Hagar.  😮
“Rules are rules”… let it be said, let it be done
McDonald's fountain Coke is the best!!!!
Have to wonder what Travis thinks when Taylor goes to the Games.
That's why I don't wear Grey 😅
I'd vote for Jason as president anything is better then the bone head we got now 😂
I didn't throw any snowballs cuz that shit was packing snow right hard, not to mention signs saying that's prohibited and you'll get escorted out the stadium.
Those are kitty cat scratches. I'm with you, Jason.
Eileen's Cookies are Amazing!!!!!  We have them in Fort Collins, CO and when I saw that - I knew it had to show up here!!  :-)
the argument over hashbrowns is such a sibling thing 💀💀 love these boys so much
If you pause the video at 57:21 i believe you can see Taylors reaction.
Don’t think Travis snd Tsylor will ever Engaged
Have to wonder if Travis snd Tsylor will Ever Last.
I love this podcast so much !!! This was the funniest thing I’ve seen in so long. God bless you guys !!!
The combos just cheaper if u take the hash brown 😂
No. Ice cold Dr Pepper..lol
LOL "We were back at the shores of where we came from"....what a viking thing to say
McDonald’s coffee.  Good stuff.
Bills kicked the ball in 4dn and that is why they got wacked they should have kik on 3rd down and tie the game
You need to go to a WVU tailgate it’s spectacular (the hospital is a parking lot away) and the after party (they burned couches)
Apparently if you add salt to the coffee it cuts the bitterness
If I accidentally get a soda, I hope it's a Dr Pepper. Best flavor in the soda world.
This is my guilty pleasure 💯💪🏻🤪
Palestine loves you guys 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fountain coke is the best at McDonald's. I don't know why but it tastes so good from them.
Trying to imagine a Wes Anderson movie about football and now I need to see that happen 😂
*Travis sweats through a t-shirt*  *Travis changes into a hoodie because that will definitely not make him sweat more*  😂 I look forward to their shenanigans every week.
McDonalds has the best Coke!  Sipping on one right now :D The Coke made in Mexico does not have the high fructose corn syrup.  They use pure cane sugar.  It's life changing.
Thank you Travis, so many injuries and came so far. Sorry the mafia was nasty. Now its go Chiefs ♥️ for the super bowl
I love you guys! You made me laugh so hard, on top of making me watch football even if I do not understand a thing about it! Praying the Chiefs win next Sunday! 😍🙏
If no one knows who Connor McDavid is please look him up because connor mcdavid and pat mahomes intensity of winning are extremely similar. Both are in it to win it. Connor mcdavid is the captain of the Edmonton Oilers and they have own 14 games in a row. Both guys give me similar vibes
There need to be a tshirt made with shirtless Jason screaming that says…KELCE CHARM or BIG YETI ENERGY
Last pitch got him Taylor. Shoot your shot Travis!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this podcast - fun times, great atmosphere ❤
I love you guys go chiefs I think the chiefs are going to the Superbowl and win it❤❤❤
Oh yeah,we keep climbing ....1.96M followers
Pat Mahomes will be the new GOAT. Bye Brady.
To quote my BIL regarding Joe’s bbq “you know it’s good bbq when you can buy motor oil and bbq in the same place”
For the people : they talk about jason jumping out of the box at minute 57:30🤪😅 “tay said she loves you” around min 59😂
Chiefs sell it in cans!
All I can think about seeing Travis and his sweat stains, is Taylor Swift got herself a real man yess
When will the Club Box Kelce tshirts come out?  I need one to go with my Mummer Kelce shirt.  😂💚🦅
These two are great together on a podcast. Good to hear two men who like to eat, instead of all the fat and food shaming out there. Enjoy life I say. Except for Travis this week against the Ravens. I can’t stand that team, their coach or arrogant, money hungry quarterback. They’re going to hold the crap out of you, and they have a similar defense as the Patriots. That 3-4 with lots of joker blitz, and two shallow safeties. Also if the D line can get a good push inside and push Lamar back you’ll frustrate him. He wants the easy check down or to gash the defense up the middle. Push him outside. Everyone is picking the Ravens. Total disrespect. You and Patrick will figure them out:)
Yea National. Even Canadian news covered that story.
Travis you are 100 percent correct in saying ice cold cherry Pepsi is the best
What does playing “lights out” mean?
Jason Kelce stole the show from ole TayTay  wonder how she really feels
GUYS !!!!  Did you not see the video of the KC fans at home setting up a fan beside their tv ...so the ball would miss the up rights....... I think their fan did it.  Just sayin !!!
Jason for President
Now way he only eats to sausage McMuffins. I am 170lbs soaking wet and eat 2 with 2 hash browns still not full lol
There are athletes who hate signing autographs, and there's Jason who describes his day as good, because "HE GOT TO SIGN" a fans jersey. What a guy. Philly's finest.
Jason is giving off I’m going to build a bunker conspiracy theorist with his combo hate 🤣
NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT LEON PHELPS!!!! That old school reference made my day!!
Where was the bracket listed to fill out? Trav, you can send all that swag you don't want to me! 😂 you'll always be el diablo and mahomes is the magic man.
@newheightshow. Jason is America's big brother!!!
Travis, I feel ya on the armpit sweat.  I've been dealing with Hyperhidrosis since I can remember, and it's SO annoying!!!  I'd friggin sweat through that hoodie, too. 🤦‍♀️
Would love to hear Kylie tell her side of the story!!!!
Jason, If you ever need electrical work done. I am an electrician who does work in the PA area by you.
As Travis grows his beard longer he morphs more into Jason.
Jason saying, "I gotta have my shirt" off reminds me of Wyatt's "I gotta dance" -- LOVE them both!
Pop us Canadians are proud
You guys could have a traveling show (after you both retire), where you hit up all the tailgates. Everyone would love that!!!! 😜😜🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥
You Both should go visit Danielle
The game was amazing and Jason made it even better!!
Good stuff.
This is the best episode ever!!! Jason at his best! 💪💪💪
Fountain drinks are the best!!!!
I love these guys but tired of NFL always bailing Pat Mahomes out smh
Travis is gonna be forever called Travis Ma-Auto now to me lol
Go Chiefs. Jason I think you’re your bros good luck charm. Must be at next game for great shenanigans
I agree with Jason on the combo meal problem. I’m not paying another 3-4 dollars for some fries and a drink, I’d rather get another food item instead with those 3-4 dollars
HEY MCDONALD'S I HOPE YOU'RE HEARING THIS!!°😂
🎉🎉🎉 have to love the kelce men 🎉🎉🎉❤
Damn these guys are related af. If Taylor and Travis break up Taylor better not try to hit us with any bs about Travis lol if she can't make this relationship work she should call it quits 😂😂
Oh my god, I was belly laughing at this one!
Amazing guys, Jason Kylie is amazing and your daughters are beautiful ❤ You two are very inspiring, thank 😊
I admit I'm a new football fan,but so glad that it's you 2 that I fell for❤️♥️ 2:25 pm KY
We don't hate you guys! There's a rivalry but no hatred. I'm sorry you dealt with some of our lesser fans.
yes Jason! POP!! :) not Soda!
Jason, does your dog always sleep on the couch like that?
Everyone in Cleveland right now is reliving the ref call that caused Bottlegate…refs missed a call, another play ran and then the refs WENT BACK and reversed the previous call. So, while not a good look, totally egregious on the refs part. (But I’m not bitter! 😂)
They are freaking Hilarious!
Omg 😳 I just came to a thought 🤔😢we are going to lose yet another SB 🏆 to the chiefs if 49ers take care of business against the lions and ofcorse if the chiefs take care of there business against ravens or my team can go lose another SB 🏆 to the 🐦‍⬛ RAVENS 😈😉 lord have mercy g wiz
These guys are elite on & off the field 🔥
Did you diss our girl by broadening the heart hand!  Your response was insulting, making sure everyone knew it wasn’t just directed at her!
I never really felt like football was for me, nor did I pay attention. Man, I completely was missing out!!!!!! Thanks so much for all the laughs you bring to my life and for introducing me to a much-needed passion :).
Jason listing all his body parts that no longer work made me sad.
😂Jason you’re hilarious!  Cola!!!  Travis! Yes!!!!! Cherry Pepsi is the bomb!!!
Seeing Jason at the game and his craziness made it even better! If only everyone were as free spirited and fun, maybe the world wouldn't be in the shape it's in. I'm with Travis, Jason for President...he'd get my vote! 😉
I thought I was the only one who felt that way about combo meals 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJMa20xXykI&ab_channel=1530Homer
The dog just crashed out😂😂
W
Trav, just take the shirt off 😊
The Bills missed field goal was because I was yelling at my TV "BOOG-A-DA, BOOG-A-DA". You are welcome. Great win Chiefs!
We need a kylie special of her reacting to the new heights podcasts.
I heard Jason and Kylie are having another baby ❤ congratulations
❤you guys and the Double1/4 pounder with cheese yes..
I know this has been said a million times…but they are just so real.  Travis is literally dating the most famous person in the world & it seems like he hasn’t changed a bit.   I’m glad Taylor is dating someone so silly and fun!   Ps- that was a whole lot of free advertising for Coke.
Jason is jason whether in buffalo or buffalo billiards
The reason the CLE fans started throwing beer bottles that game was because the refs went back after a play was already ran to review the previous play. They gained what looked to be a 1st down, then spiked the ball to stop the clock, then officials went back and changed the spot after the fact, that was the issue!
Drunkards
The meme's of Jason were EPIC. Way to solidify that sexiest man alive nomination!! ;)
I can't agree with Trav more. Wild cherry Pepsi fountain style can't be beat!!
Great Podcast fellas.Never laughed so hard. Really hoping the 49ers and Chiefs are going to the Superbowl. ❤️💛🏈
I am not a football women, but I stumbled across your podcast, makes me smile. Thanks for being positive and kind in this negative world. I am a dog rescue lady, saw the pic above your fireplace Jason, are they Rottweilers?  That is my favorite breed to rescue.  Just curious.  🙂
Snow out, tits out!
Could you please not use the f word!’ I love to watch this and think you’re fun to listen too. I hate the f word so much. You are to smart to use that word!!❤
Yinz are hilarious but get some better cameras. Probably get them for free so hook it up
Newest Taylor Swift lyric “blending in with the trees”
The Jason kelce wine spill prank was epic too 😂😂
Holy Shit!!! A Sherlock Holmes/Basil Rathbone reference?!?!? Damn Jason!!!
I've got more to say. Travis your style is spot on. You rocked that outfit. Love watching you play  the game...good job. Congratulations.
As a Bills fan, I have always loved the Kelce brothers, just not when we playing against each other haha. But I am sorry for some fans being over the top, I hate that and can assure you there are tons of wonderful bills fans. I think every fan base has some morons it comes with the territory. I am so happy Jason got to witness and be a part of the Mafia and good luck to Travis and the Chiefs moving forward.
Kylie already warned everyone, Jason is loud. 😂  Hey Jason, is that a wolfhound knocked out on your sofa next to his bowls. 😆 Wolfhound’s rock!
I don't care how many views Shannon Sharpe and Kat had yall are forever gonna be my guys. I swear I feel like we're family ❤
I also LOVE McD’s coffee!! 😁
Mmmmmmm!  Z Man and fries!!!
Bills fan, was at the game.  It was a great game, I was able to take my son with me.  Was an experience both of us will never forget.
It was 10 cent beer night 6-7-1974 Texas Rangers vs The Tribe.
I'll paint that and send it to you at One Arrowhead drive FREE!!! EASY SHIPPING IN MISSOURI ALSO!
*travis.....next weeks game take Malic acid and PQQ supplement will give you lots of energy for the game....I want you to win for Taylor and advance into superbowl*
*travis.....next weeks game take Malic acid, PQQ will give you lots of energy for the game....I want you to win for Taylor and advance into superbowl*
I have to mention that adorable pup on the couch behind Jason!
Glad you had fun in Buffalo definitely wish the score went the Bills way... we'll be back next year
Great show. Looking forward to Friday.
I'm a Lion's fan, but will also be hoping for a KC   Win this weekend.  Sorry that the Eagles are out.  You 2 are the best!  Female football fan.
Travis laughing is the absolute best 😂😂😂😂
O-H-I-O !
WOW. 145k
Aluminum beer bottles!
It’s totally anti hero inspired
I like Travis’ style to deny things that he didn’t give them a heads up, imagine if all the free stuff sent to him (and other famous people) that they didn’t want was donated! DONATE to local shelters and schools ❤
"SO TELL ME ABOUT BUFFALO" MERCH NEEDED ASAP!!!!!
Fucking love these guys.
Trav is right the McDonald’s hash brown is legendary. Can’t pass that up. But Jason is also correct that the sausage egg and cheese is the goat. I lived off of those when I was pregnant with my second 😂 so shoutout to McDonald’s for keeping me and my baby alive 😘
I’m here for the Retirement Tailgate Tour. Winnebago, beer meister, and a charbroil 😂
Hilarious episode! Great job guys.
I've been ordering my food the Jason way for years. Rookie move to order the combo.
When y’all retire we need the pod cast hosted at everyone stadiums tailgate
This is gonna reach a mil
You both are the best. Look forward to your podcast every week. I am a 49ers fan. You both have made me a fan of football. I learn alot listening to you both. The love you have for each other is so great. Keep this podcast going please. The laughs are infectious 😊
He got this all jacked up 😂😂😂. You guys need to be eating the steak egg and cheese McGriddle if you want calorie for your bucks lol. Delicious
Jason: I wasn’t asking permission!  Kylie: What do you want to name the cat ?😂😂🐈 😂😂
Bro Jason's dog is slumpt about 92 %😂😂
Lake Erie always makes me feel like home too. Its like it calls to me
I love Joe's. I like the Hog Heaven sandwich 🤤
That’s y I don’t wear grey no more😂
47:17 I skip through the add reads often but this was one of the funniest cuts I've seen. Instantly has the hat he bought for himself 😂 many people probably wont see this but editor nailed it
Go Chiefs this weekend !!!!
Cherry Coke. FTW lol
come on, jason, OBVIOUSLY the valentine's day move is to buy kylie a kitten
I'm sorry what does 92%ers mean?
McDonald’s is the only fast food place I get my Diet Coke, they’ve got the syrup & carbonation perfect! When you get a great belch from the that first drink that’s a good one! lol
Jason you are so genuine. Love your kids and your wife! Good life. Yes, stay away from the pop. 😑 I hope Travis and Taylor get engaged and have babies soon. They just seem like perfect for each other.🌹 he respects women ❤
“I gave this to myself” i seriously can’t even 😂😂😂  #etsy #giftmode 🙌🏻😂❣️
the lions where on the 20 they would have kicked a field goal and still be up plenty - no reason to call timeout
You’re always welcome in Buffalo Jason!! And Trav I’m sorry some of the Mafia members are idiots but I promise the vast majority of us have nothing but respect for yall! ❤️
Love Jason !!
Love all the love to Bills fans here. Lifelong Chiefs fan & happy to see it. It's all about the game which we all love.
Love ❤️ your show . Congrats Travis on your win against Buffalo . I am a lifetime Eagles 🦅 fan and would love a jersey , Hope Jason is coming back for next season ❤️🦅🏈
It’s a giant chocolate chip cookie decorated!
RE: wide right  I could tell by the way the kicker struck the ball, as well as by the way it pushed right...  the wind was dramatically different at about the ten yard line than it was at the spot of the kick.  If you watch closely, it was obvious that the ball was tracking *perfectly* , given the distance and hash mark - until it got to the ten yard line.    You can argue that it was the kicker's home field.  He should be familiar with the conditions and wind at both ends, and adjust accordingly.  I'm sure he feels that way.  But, it's very difficult to judge differences in wind velocity and direction without visual reference - which he did not have.  I was supporting the Chiefs, but I felt horrible for that kicker.
Things probably never said by a Presidential candidate EVER... "I wish I had stayed out there long enough to get my nipples hard"
This is your best episode. Legendary siblings relationship. I can't count how many stories I have with my siblings but our moto was always "we can mess with each other but no one else can"
Good job Trav.! Keep grinding! Lets GO CHIEFS!!! #ChiefsKingdom
Cherry Dr. Pepper rules!
Thanks for the laughter !! I’m sure Taylor really is enjoying all of these shenanigans !! Thanks for all you guys do !! You have lifted so many spirits and certainly have given a positive spin on the NFL !!! Keep up your great works brothers !! Best of luck Kanas Chief’s! !!
Can we talk about why trav is sweeting his a$$ off I see your pits haha he trying so hard not lift his arm in this one
"Just follow the trail." 😂😂
I completely agree with Jason about the best item being the sausage egg and cheese sandwhich, I only add a large OJ instead of their coffee!
Just scored a New Heights tee AND a Jason Kelce tee. Must represent! Love you guys!
As far as the beer throwing thing, it WAS Cleveland during a baseball game where they gave out free beer. People rushed the field and the game got cancelled!
The best video out is pat mahomes sr. Telling Jason “Ky said to get your ass back in here.”
Canadian football fan here...love watching Collaros play up here, he will be inducted into CFL Hall of Fame. Classy guy!
Wait, he was dealing with an MCL sprain?!?!
I would love to watch an Amazon or Netflix limited series that follows Jason as he tailgates around the NFL.
Travis my son favourite is a cheery coke
Ravens fan here 💜🖤  I’ll be there this Sunday and no hostility here, I love y’all but I gotta root for my boys. Understand the rivalry and the trash talk but I’m hoping you have a better experience in Baltimore. Nothing but love however I hope you lose 😬😂💜🖤
49:52 I'm a football fan and love both you guys❤ always got your brother ❤ reminds me of my little brother's
Gotta get the hash browns. They never make it out of the parking lot. LOL
McDonald’s fountain coke is the only good fountain coke imo
Danielle:) Super sweet! Enjoy your shirt:)
Take out the egg and you’ll forever be grateful. Their Sausage McMuffins are the best item on the menu
I remember bottle-gate in Cleveland...we was in the end-zone opposite of the dawg pound, and we started seeing bottles flying over our heads! A Jack Daniels bottle just missed us and we decided to get out of there!
Try honey, it is the best.😊
That’s very sweet of Daniella. And cool of you to interact with her.  PS you can’t go to fast food anymore and expect to have the correct order. 😂
Jason I'm a fan. But please tell me... is that dog behind you dead and if so why areyou saving him?
omg I enjoyed every minute of this episode. 😂😂😂
Love Trav but ur Bill's wall in outfit was giving Drew Barrymore talk show oversized suit. Love Drew. Love trav.
As a bills fan, I was saying all week to friends leading up to the game that the chiefs would win and probably blow us out and I’m surprised it was as close as it was because we had 5-6 starters on defense every one else was either a 3rd or 4th stringer, and assumed they would torch out d. I barely watched any game all year but i was sort of keeping an eye out with what’s happening in the league.
The cut to Jason wearing the cap he gifted himself from Etsy has me DEAD
I can see a travel show with the two of you visiting tailgate parties in different stadiums.
Jason you are so funny. Right on with the coke!!! Your closet is perfect. I really enjoy this podcast, however I'm starting to curse more. I'm trying to be a sweet old lady...boring. Somehow the cussing gets the point out there!!!
LETS GO LAMARRRR BIG TRUSSS
Retirement plan, taking New Heights on the road and tailgating among the fans with a new show segment.
Can you please explain the Pro Bowl?
Jason - my husband stands with you - anywhere we go for breakfast sausage, egg and cheese with a black coffee.... 25 years I've been married to this man, and it's always the same. Thanks y'all for the awesome podcast it hits all the notes for our family - football, family and occasional Taylor. (our twins are big Taylor fans, my husband (& my Mom was) a die hard Seahawks fan). Much love to ya'll.
Jason liking the McMuffin over the McGriddle has made me like him a little bit less but that’s still a lot
Jason I hope we get to see you in kelly greens one more year. But if you are going to retire I think all 4 Philly sports teams should come together and hire you as the official hype man for all our teams.
I’m crying laughing at this podcast. 😂😂😜🫶
Honestly bummed we didn’t get to hear from Queen Kylie herself
The Kelce Bro’s need to go on a “Stadium Shenanigan’s Tour” 🏈🏈
I instantly thought of the sound in TikTok of That’s my man, yep that’s my man, he’s mine when Jason jumped out of the window and Kylie just shook her head.
Jason, and Travis, we need Kylie to come on and give us her take on Jason in the box 😂😂😂😂!!!
There ls you your new retirement show!!!! Tailgate with the Kelces
The Jason Kelce Charm 🎉
Wow that dog is huge! (Or bear, can’t tell) what is it? lol
Imagine Jason at an Arrowhead playoff tailgate!!🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
jason doesn't believe in restaurant menu combos and travis likes pepsi.... i don't know if i can keep being a 92%er 😿
You two ROCK  every podcast!!!!
Dude started on fire like he was wearing 1970’s pajamas 😂😂😂 #buffalove
"your fucky fucky" by Jason is the best part of the video
P. E P. S. I. = Ohio allll the way!!! It's POP too 😍😆😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Montgomery county proud over here!!
Ok Bert and Jason need to have a tailgate show together!!
Like a gloveeeee I love that we grew up on the same movies I also like gooooolld
Gotta love Jason's self awareness! "I'm a hoarder." 😂
He’s dehydrated… as he opens another energy drink lol
Love the dog behind Jason on the couch!
Is that a dog on the couch behind Jason?
That kicked sliced like my golf shot
Love this podcast! Many laughs
You add the hashbrown to the breakfast sandwich…it’s a cheat code to level up!
Damn he threw old girl under the bus😂😂😂
Jason Kelce for president
@Jasonkelce  Big guy you didn’t make a bad impression  You were a real guy having a real good time.
Dear Jason,  You put the hash brown inside the McMuffin. Winning combo!
God,  you guys crack me up.
Fountain Big Red at White Castle is like that!
I'm so sad I couldn't find where to enter a fan bracket. Sounds like it was fun
Your thinking of marv levy  Jason  when is are both coming to 🇬🇧  also Jason for president and priminister
The picture of Jason screaming out of the suite window is getting framed and going on my wall.  I love how tiny the beer looks in his hand - it's like that picture of Andre the Giant with a full size beer in his hand but it looks like a pony!
Love these 2🙌🏽👏🏽🫶🏽
You guys are the absolutely best 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ from DR 🇩🇴
Jason, I hate to tell you, but you are wrong: McDonald's hash browns are their best thing, Travis is correct.
I would have LOVED to see Kylie tell Jason to be on his best behaviour!! Jason is the MVP of everyone's hearts, be it Bills Mafia, Chiefs Kingdom, Eagles Nation, etc. Having him run for president would make me want to be his campaign manager so badly! Great episode. I laughed so much! 🤣
We were at the Browns game when the beer bottles were thrown. Refs made a really bad call and the crowd went wild. The only time I was glad we were in the nose bleeds. After that game no bottles allowed.
Just a FYI, maybe throw a wild card entry in, The Washington Redskins.  Let's see how that plays.
I love your family!
Travis is right. An ice cold cherry Pepsi is so good after a football game.
Trav had to change his shirt.  Poor baby was having pit issues.  lol
Travis you need to get botox on those pits it fixes it for real 😂
Great show guys. They get better every week..... no shit they teally do.
Ohio girl here, it is pop. That's why it was time to leave New England, cause I heard myself order a soda...
Feast of Baachus! Perfect 😂
It’s his wolf dog passed out on the sofa behind him that’s got me!! 😂😂🐕🐾
anybody else wanna see Bert Kreischer and Jason Kelce get topless and compete in a drunk decathlon where the last event is a sumo match? Just me?
My stamp of the week goes to Jason, not for being a BOSS hype man, but for being the best wingman for that little girl with the sign for Taylor. Total dad move ♥️
BWW doesn’t support their pregnant employees. I fainted three times in the walk in and they couldn’t care less. I was left in the freeze for twenty five minutes. I could’ve lost my baby and they still told me to roll sliverware. Please don’t support them!
Love this podcast❤ I look forward to it weekly!!😊😊thank you for being you!!
I really enjoy watching your podcast I like Travis in the Cheifs and Jason on eagles you too rock
The "Bills fans" giving you the disrespectful hate before the game are the same people sending Tyler Bass death threats. They claim Bills Mafia but we don't claim them. Buffalo is the city of good neighbors. Good game, wish we could have come out on top but such is life. Cheering for the Lions here on out!
Marv Levy and Oklahoma Joe’s references. Yeaaaaaah.
Y'all seriously need to check out sponsorships by coke, Pepsi, and McDonald's y'all are leaving money on the table. Love y'all and the joy you are bringing to the world. 😊
Get Jones to do a Leroy Jenkins impersonation lol. That would be epic
Travis, I lo🎉ve your Ne😢w Heights  Pod Cast. Please watch how many "F" bombs you throw around.  Young people like watching.  You could be a good mentor! 46:10
Travis you can take that shirt off if you want.
Rewatch crew. Cleveland all good for throwing dog bones also
Jason saying he’s gonna stash jerseys in his car and Travis basically immediately saying “no no don’t say that” is hilarious 😂
Jason - ask for the McDonald's hashbrown well done. You will enjoy it...promise :)
me and jason rly the same “the breakfast i’ve had since the age of 5” 😭😭
I love me some lake erie
Let’s be real the red dots are probably cat scratches 🤣
I couldn’t stop laughing when talking about when Jason taking his shirt off in front of Taylor 😂
Jason, you are a fucking legend!
As a big time Bills fan Jason and Travis is always welcomed to party with the Mafia
Can I call you kelce how much you can save by bundling home and auto? 🤔🤨
The first year you're both retired, you owe your mama a holiday at home together!❤
Get a custom portrait made on ETSY of Jason and do a giveaway!!
Jason for President, Ragnow for VP.  Kel-Now campaign.
Jason talks and Travis laughs and comments is the greatest!!
Coach Marv Levy
Jason is an absolute DAWG! I love this dude and his energy. Whatever he chooses to do next he will be awesome in it!!
Jason, come to Happy Valley and experience a Penn State tailgate!
Sonic Route 44 Cherry Limeade is the best drive thru drink
You should have a button that you press with your daughter saying NEW NEWS. just saying !! ❤
I remember south stands Broncos in the old stadium throwing beer bottles!
Jason you never been to a cleveland tailgate party????  Just KC and Buff don't you think its time to do a Cleveland Tailgate ALSO  You new job could be working for fox sports or ESPN or NFL network and go to stadium to stadium tailgate parties to find the best tailgate party  if you decide to retire GOOD LUCK LOVE THE SHOW FROM CLEVELAND OHIO!!!
Jason and Travis.....You guys are so much fun!!❤
Minute 39.00 Travis  is sweating big time again 🤣
I'm also still in shock at Cara Delevingne being there at the front of their booth while Jason is standing there yelling lol
The old school reference- chefs kiss
Dr Pepper trumps Cherry Pepsi in my book.
“Just out here blending in the trees baby” 😂😂😂
Truly nothing better than an ice cold fountain Coca Cola-and one from McDonalds is the best!
We be love you, Jason!! You have Bills Mafia forever!!
I love how positive and fun you two are, I cannot watch sports on TV with my husband because… I will be screaming…”men arguing! Men arguing “
As a Bills fan this was a tough loss.... fricking wide right.  Thank you guys for being awesome. This was very healing. Love your energy Jason❤❤
@newhieghts Yes, Jason Kelce for President 2024! :)
By far one of the funniest episodes this week 😂😂 🙌🏼
The two of you are awesome brothers with this amazing podcast that promises to bring great vibes in 2024. It is the best entertainment source out there, offering 100% entertainment. Despite some haters Travis, 92% of the audience loves and supports the Chiefs even in Canada. Haters gonna hate hate hate. Now that song stuck in my head 😂
If you both feel that at home in Buffalo.... maybe you should sign together and be a part of the Mafia forever!  Kelce Bills Brothers?!?
I think you guys should podcast, even if it’s less, during the off season! You guys could talk about anything and make it so good!!
I gave up the NFL and lost my ability to enjoy football when Colin Kapernick was blackballed for using his platform to protest police killing black and brown people. I still can't get over how dirty they did him. I'm not a Swifty nor am I returning to being a die hard Chief's fanatic, but I really love and respect these brothers for how they role model healthy behavior in men. I'll be back to New Heights.
As a lifelong Bills Mafia member, thank you for embracing our fun, crazy vibe ❤️
waiting on my signed jersey now XD
Waiting at the Dr. today and heard the lady across from me talking about how she was sad because she was missing New Heights. She noticed that I was smiling to myself and we looked at each other like we were part of a secret society that is the 92%. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Try Coke or Pepsi with grenadine. It taste so much better than the cherry version of either flavor.
THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO HmmmMMMM..... 🤨🤔🤔🤔  When a fella's armpits were sweating SOOO profusely/copiously, that the saying: "sweating buckets", literally morphed from a mere descriptive metaphor, into a TOTALLY legit form of measurement......I gotta be honest: That fella swapping out his completely drenched t-shirt, for a THICK ass fuGGin HOODY, was NOT the wardrobe adjustment that I had bet all my money on. LoL.
Both them boys just run hot ✌️
I just found out i was born a day before Travis Kelce. Thats cool.
same, do not like the hashbrown at mcd's
Jason is so damn funny. Love these guys and not even fans of their teams
What is that !?! A treasure map ?? Just follow the trail 😂😂😂☠️😭
I hope Jason is going to the next game.
I didn’t think I could love Jason more but then he called Wes Anderson a beast💘🥰
Jason nailed it about fountain coca-cola!
Why I retired. So I can watch these guys….oops maybe need to go back to work. GO CHIEFS!
I’m a big Chiefs fan and your podcast is my absolute favorite thing I look forward to every Wednesday. The banter, humor, and and analysis of the football games is so good. Love the Kelce family. ❤🏈
Sweetie Yeti 😆 🤣 😂
so - used cars next?
Have you guys heard how taylor swift is getting so much exposure now for dating travis kelce?? Crazy
BOOM to the Brothers.............!
I love that you said Pop! Definitely a Michigan Ohio thing!🎉❤Two Irish wolfhounds!! Awe!🫵🏻
As a bills fan. Love both of you.  You both rock and are beyond class always.   Just please stop beating us🥲
Travis needs to just take his shirt off!
Jason holding the 12 year old up was one of my heart ❤️  felt things. He made her preteen/teen core memories. Now we have a new  football fan ...
Oh my gosh ❤
LIONS🦁🦁🦁🦁
Jason vs Baltimore fans? They don't seem like the welcoming types like Bills mafia....buy a round for the house!
I believe the name beercules fits Jason when he drinks
Was Warren Moon and the Houston oilers game
Ok I'm new here.... what's the meaning of 92 percenters?
New news!!!! I got to tell my brother-in-law about y’all! I knew and he didn’t!!!
Referencing The Ladies Man just solidified you guys are us!
Jason that was so sweet you picking up the little girl so she could show Taylor her sign❤
Love the Kelces even as a bills fan, nothing more to say all love
We don’t even play this kind of football in India 🇮🇳! I came here as Taylor Swift fan but stayed here for these entertaining and love filled family!♥️
No dumb question  Give us your top 5 most underrated QB in the league mine are Kirk cousins-baker mayfield Jorden love Jared Goff Aiden o’Connell
Lake Erie forever!
Everyone's gonna be upset the heart was to show love, not just for taylor
Travis's perfectly aligned and stocked refrigerator is so aesthetically pleasing.
Honestly. The Kelce tailgate roadtrip would make a phenomenal show
Most anticipated episode ever 😊
OMG! JK for prez!!! This is the most excited I’ve been about the upcoming election 🔥🔥🔥of an idea!
What's a 92%'er?
That comment about Hardman is straight class.
Jason Kelce and I have the same McDonald’s order, that’s wild 😂
Jason has such grumpy, skeptical old dad energy in the body of a 36 year old. And I love it. 🤣
Jason for president! Let’s go!
“It’s place kicking.  Same thing.” 😂😂😂
Jason is so funny.. someone screwed his order up..
I don’t understand Jason’s beef with a combo meal 😂
Commission that painting
Trav always be happy there is random people they want take ur happiness away........so there is certain worker every where working for Kris jinner, NBA Devin Booker,bad bunny and NFL obj ravens, NFL bills and lions and Baldwin,bieber....... groups always they pay people they disterbe hard working female artists tylor swift and Selena Gomez so u need around u police and some security these group of people they play skin poletics bcoz they forget they r on them on them own kids...........so protect ur family and ur teammates........anyway .....One day we need to see in ur podcast...... isaiah Pacheco......❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ We love Kelce brothers......every week u make us laugh...haters gonna hates.......we watching football not politicians over acting fake models baby daddy ........

I donated 22.00 in Bass's honor to a cat sanctuary he supports. No one deserves hate after a football game.  😢
Jason has some awesome dogs, love his buddy lounging back there
Jason, you look too pale.  Take the family down south away from the winter.
YES!!!! MY FAVORITE TRAVIS WILD CHERRY PEPSI
Great week boys! Thanks for the laughs!
Bills fans punching air rn 😂
OMG!! I needed this to get through this Wednesday...it's carrying me through to the weekend! Thanks Kelce brothers...always bringing the joy and laughter!!
This is effn hilarious, we’re goin streaking
That huge Chiefs/Royals parking lot.   I couldn’t find my damn car (90’s before a car alarm) after a Chiefs game.  😂
JASON, THANK YOU FOR LIFTING THE LITTLE GIRL UP. She will remember that forevermore 😘
Surprised no mention of Jason lifting up the girl with the sign.  That was a really endearing moment
I'm convinced the wind proved Sunday night that Mother Nature is a Chiefs fan!
So we just need Jason to be going to tailgate for all the chiefs game next season
Who else is here because of Jason's weekend  videos 😂😂🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️
The guy from youngstown  (cleveland fan ) that was arrested for throwing a beer on the field and hitting a stealers player.. he lived on my street. he was a highway patrolman and lost his job for over a year over it.  He was later put back on the force by the union.. just funny you guys talked about this.
Jason told Kylie if my first impression ,when I was blacked out on a bar was epic. Hold my shirt I can top that. Welcome to the family Taylor
Congrats. You ran past a guy who was on his couch 2 weeks ago. Do it against Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen.
No, Cherry Coke or Pepsi 😊
Im disappointed that they kept saying Shenanigans and no quoted Super Troopers
SODA!
Only thing better than an ice cold Wild Cherry Pepsi is an ice cold Wild Cherry Pepsi after sex.
As always but not so New News Eagles Suck 😮 lol jk
hurts to watch this as a bills fan man
The sausage egg and cheese McMuff is the absolute best - I luv you both but am going #teamJason on this one......and we all know they have the best Coca Cola!
Set the bar nice & low! 😂
Can’t order a large coke but no regrets on 40+beers. 🤣
McDonalds has the best fountain soda
You are a dawg and you get a game ball congrats Travis Kelce ❤️
Cherry Pepsi is the move if not Dr pepper cherry or strawberry and cream Dr pepper
You guys have to come up to Winnipeg to visit Zach Collaros and tail gate with Bomber Fans!!!!!!
I love how Philadelphia Eagles fans always got the worst reputation of being the most aggressive but they always hide the other teams fans acting worse than we ever did. 1 time we throw snow balls at Santa Claus and we are deemed the evil villains for life  😆😆😆😆😆🦅🏉 43:29
The gag reflex I had when I heard Rumplemintz. Can they not pick any other alcohol? Lol
12:35 Travis telling everyone that sends him Gifts. That he just haS the staff throw them out he don't even look 😂😂
Okay but Jason’s dog in the background….😂😂
No hash brown? Crazy!
WE NEED TO HAVE JASON KELCE AND TRAVIS KELCE AS GRAND MARSHALLS FOR MARDI GRAS! THEY'D BE AWESOME!!!!
As I just finished eating a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle (Was supposed to be mcmuffin, but.... screwups, am I right?) AND a hashbrown... But I agree with Travis, the hashbrown is #1.
The dog....sound asleep on the couch❤
The tone is incredibly positive irregardless of the situation, I don't watch the sports channels or any of the sports shows because of the inability to really capture the game.
These two, I could literally go to a show with them, being funny. Also, they gave some free endorsements!
Travis changing his shirt mid show cause of sweating..comes back with sweatshirt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Travis was dressed like Waldo.
Just here to post my hate towards Swifties, hope none of you have good lives!
FYI Pittsburgh doesn’t talegate the most sober team. More of a family environment. Cincinnati is 7 miles from Rock n roll hall of fame and cool bar strip right by too. Bills are building a new stadium but I wanna hear Travis talk about the cold showers, is that true?
I want to see Pacheco on the show!  This is the internet today! 😂😂😂
from a philly and bills fan, ur VERY welcome to come bacc to buffalo 💙
South bend Notre dame tailgates are amazing
when batman reveals himself 😂 to actually be shirtless lineman and everyone is cheering 👏🏼
Can’t get enough of you guys!!
So the best soda I've ever had was A&W root beer out of a keg!!!! I'd recommend it even though you don't get the caffeine it's so smooth and delicious...
Would it he so hard for Travis to refrain from “F Bombing” I know it’s mostly adults watching the podcast but inevitably there must be some kids considering there are probably some “Swifties”…the Podcast would still be great without cursing
Please look up and buy the Jason pop shirtless toys 😂 ☠️
Jason-"I've got a bad back"  Also Jason- *Yeats himself out of the box*
So glad he calls it pop! lol
Love you guys!!!! Go Chiefs!!❤
I'm like Trav, we needed more cameras on Kylie. I was really hoping she'd slip in to the podcast to give her reaction to Jason's antics. Kylie needs to be on the bonus video this week.
Lmao, these niggas trippen.😂😂😂😂😂😂
My initial reaction to seeing the shirtless Jason was wtf. Now after getting a deeper insight to he was enjoying tailgate life "living fully in the moment", I have nothing but admiration and respect.
The Vikings playoff game in 1975 against Dallas Roger Staubach threw a Hail Mary at the end of the game and Drew Pearson pushed off and caught a TD to win the game. A whiskey bottle came out of the stands and hit the ref in the head.
Part of the Jason Kelce charm!!!
Bring it all the way home trav. Hell of a season this year!
Mexican coke is better than a fountain coke. Jason has to try it
You guys are so real . Love it . Change the shirt
Can we have New Heights with Kylie in the off season?
Bills fan here. I appreciate you guys so much and already looking forward to next season. Good luck moving forward!
Travis... Check out Carpe antiperspirant. You will NOT sweat. It's great for people who have a sweating issue. 😊❤
How do I become a member of the 92%ers?
I think I read somewhere McDonald and coke have a contract where the coke recipe is slightly change to make it better… I’m not sure
As someone who lives far away from the Bills stadium, I was pro-Dome until I saw them throwing all the snow in the air. So fun!
As someone that got hit in the head with some of the celebratory snow/ice tossing, I could've done without it, cool or not. 🤣My huge Chiefs fan son's first NFL game, and in enemy territory at that, was an experience though!
You guys are the best! Thank you for all the laughs!  🤗🤗
It’s Cherry mead in the bowling ball
Bills Mafia loves you Kelce boys!
You had me at belly trail LMAO
Men acting like men. Yes'ir.   And the women that luv them, help make them.
Botox under armpits take that away.
Filet o fish is the best item at mcdonalds
Here me out; A show with Travis and Jason going to to different tailgates every week in the style of "Insomniac with Dave Attell".
Jason looks like he's in a nice room doing the podcast at home,  I love when you can hear the girls screaming in the background.  Feels very real .  Poor  Travis looks like he's broadcasting in his closet!!!!😂😂😂. Someone needs to help the poor boy out with some interior design suggestions.  Love the podcast!  Hoping for a Lions vs Chiefs Superbowl 🎉🎉🎉.
McDonald’s uses a different kind of coke. It’s meant to be paired with they fries or their food in general
Was Jordan Mailata there?  Seems like he's in that picture that Travis loved.
Holy cow I love these guys ,lots of love from Nova Scotia Canada ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jason’s candle  should be a road flare
Would love to see Mama Kelce, Taylor, and Kylie’s reactions to Jason doing Jason things!
Canada says HI from the chilly north. Attended game vs Raiders...wtf was that Travis??😂
As wee Wyatt said "because you are sneaky" lol Best game ever!
Would love to see Mama Kelce, Taylor, and Kylie’s reactions to Jason doing Jason things!
Not just national but McDonalds + Kelce is international 'new' news 🇨🇦
Absolute blasphemy from Jason to disparage the hash,  brown. Travis as a fellow cherry coke fan, much respect 👊🙏
Travis trying to grow that beard out like big bro!! Lol
I don't agree with Trav.. Coca Cola all the way!
best item at Mcdonalds is the Custard pies
Nick's brother Jeff is a menace!😅
Letting him be his authentic self is so much better in the long run. True for everyone!
McDonald’s hash browns are the only thing I can eat when I’m hungover 😂😂
Cam Jurgens locker is bare.  GBR
https://youtube.com/shorts/V_VDbZALkDU?si=A7jzSx2MxLpI0kZN  This was hilarious 😂
Go Bills
Bills fan here. Congrats on the win, Travis and thanks for the entertainment, Jason. ❤
You guys pump so much joy and fun into each episode, love your podcast!!!
Jason.... YES! Build your own meal at the drive thru all the way 😄
Moisture wicking material only TK lol
I'm dying at Jason insinuating that Travis' cleat marks are indeed cat marks. 🤣
I need to know where to send stuff to Jason.  He has been voted onto our Beer League Beautys hockey team.  I need to send him his jersey, because he is the definition of a Beer League Beauty.
“Treasure Map”.  Dying. 🤣
35:30............Dumb rule. Move the offense back to the 20, 25 or 40 yard line with 1st and 10. Not a turnover.
You just mentioned my two favorite fountain pops.  I get Coke if its Coke only brands and Cherry Pepsi if its Pepsi brand only.
I’m with Trav on the hashbrown
Did Travis say "don't peak too soon" to Jason when Jason tried to say the Bills loved him(Travis)? 😂
Younger sibling eclipsed by older (story throughout history!) 😂😉
😀😀best show yet lmao
Jason, you basically embody Bills Mafia at its core! Welcome to the club!!! ❤️💙🦬
Question for both of you at what point do you or did you think “hey I’m one of the best at my position.”
Travis is right. The hashbrowns at McDonalds are their best item
😂 I think with every episode we fall in love with Jason just a little bit more! He’s awesome! ❤
There's a shot with Kylie in the background basically rolling her eyes 😂
Now they’re going to come out with a Jason Kelce order at McDonald’s 😂🫶🏻
Thank you Jason for bringing that up. FOUNTAIN DRINK IS THE WAY TO GO! But I have to say, fountain Pepsi is the absolute best, is the same flavor every time 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
Yes, once you both retire- someone please create a show with Jason and Travis going to tailgates around the country!
I said at the jump that the decision to defer on opening kickoff was the best coaching decison of this game. With the wind and the pregame kicks looking trash, putting the bills in that direction in the second half might pay off if the game was close. If it came down to kicks, as it did, nobody wanted to kick into that maelstrom. I feel horrible for Tyler Bass, especially with the Bills history. I love that Chiefs fans (im a Cardinals fan, 22 year season ticket holder) came together and donated to his charity and have been showing him love, as did Josh Allen. Bass is a great kicker and had to be in his feels so bad. I hope our fan base would show that kind of grace.
Travis, I’m sure you know that caffeine is one of the things that dehydrate you.
Travis apologizing to Hardman for his fumble is such an amazing teammate thing to do. Football is accountability, and it just shows how much more mature Trav has come as a football player and leader of this team. I look forward to watching this podcast every week!
Personally, I love watching these guys. It's a really cool podcast or whatever the fuck you call these. The coolest thing is, you get what you think is their personal self and not some fake bullshit.  As per the Missed Field Goal, it made me so happy and relieved. I was scared they would stop us.
That’s smart! Get both of the pepsi and coke endorsements!
the whole McDonald's conversation had me rolling lol. I don't order pop as well, but if they mess up and you know, give me a Coke, I ain't complaining.
W
Vikings vs Cowboys the Hail Mary catch Drew Pearson allegedly interfere with the corner and it was not called.  A ref got hit on the head with a beer bottle or 12 volt battery., knocking him out.
the first clip made me finish my whole water bottle i think he just cracked a code for me
I happen to agree with Jason on combo thinking. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
This is why we love ya’ll! Travis profusely sweating from his pits in the grey t-shirt and then comes back in a pullover jacket 😂😂😂 MAKE IT MAKE SENSE, TRAVIS!
Bro......Is that s dead dog on the couch!!!
I love me some Jason
I always call Travis kelc now opposed to kelce, I usually say trav kelc actually
Pouty mouth Travis😱 kids watch this podcast. Still a fan of the Kelce’s
dream vacation that im saving for is come to arrowhead for a game and party at a tailgate massive fan from the uk
Jason, your dog looks absolutely relaxed in the background!! 🐕💤💤💤
1:05:20 My wife works there!!
Congrats 87
Yes! Jason Kelce for President!!!
Never watched football until came across you 2. 61 years old and loving some football and your antics. Thanks for the laughs
You guys are terrific good old Jason he might as well retire and become stand-up comedian he needed to let all that add pressure out of them great job guys good luck this weekend Travis
After Jason took his shirt off and jumped out of the suite I saw a social media post that said " Just think guys he will be giving the best man speech at Travis's wedding . imagine what that will be like"   lol
I want that picture autographed
So glad to hear Jason got a terrific reception from the Bills fans and had an awesome time! Having grown up in Western New York (I shoveled snow in the Blizzard of '77), I can tell you that Western New Yorkers are tough as nails. With all that snow and gloomy winters, we show all our love to the sports teams to get out all that pent-up energy. Go Bills!
Jason is correct, the elite item on McDonald’s menu is sausage egg and cheese McMuffin. ELITE
Jason will never be given a coffee ever again😂
The sausage egg McCheese rocks!
I don't care what you call me, just don't call me late for dinner.  My dad's favorite saying. Hahaha
Jason, do you have a great dane dog??
The tailgating retirement idea is a good one!! Maybe that could be a podcast/vlog series y’all do .   Tailgate at every stadium😂
'Calories per dollar' is offensive lineman math!! haha!
This is the best! 😂lol  I was waiting for this podcast
As always fellas great show and was waiting for this podcast all week😊 as a life long chiefs fan watching the game and super excited to catch the show mid week 😀 love Jason and what he's doing wish they talked about the Lil girl swiftie he held up and made her nigh. ❤❤ teared up knowing it made her night class act 4sure
I am having a blast listening to them, and it’s making my day at work SO MUCH BETTER!!
As a Cleveland girlie, I love when y’all start talking about Cleveland events or places because it’s nice to hear people actually do know about the local history and grew up in the area talking about it. So my ears perked up instantly at the mentions of bottlegate. My dad and uncle were at that game and we were just talking about it a few weeks ago so as soon as Jason was like “Pittsburgh?” I was sitting here yelling “IT WAS THE JAGS!” At my screen. My dad said as soon as the bottles started flying he was out, packed it up and head straight home. With the cost of beer he couldn’t imagine throwing beer out onto the field like that. For clarification too: 10 cent beer night was in the mid 70s at municipal stadium at an Indians game, against one of the Texas teams. I don’t remember which one, but I believe it was a promotion to try and get more people into the stadium because attendance was low at that time.   Also, once Jason’s retired I would KILL to see him have a little homecoming and tailgate at a Cleveland game. I think he’d have an absolutely great time here if he had that much fun in Buffalo.
The Sweaty Yeti ...  😂
Absolutely loved seeing Jacon enjoy the football game & congrads Travis on the win... See ya Sunday...
Can't this podcast just go on year round please?
100% with the Cherry Pepsi!
Call Peyton sounds like need a "Kelce's Places" tailgating  at nfl games😊
You did it AGAIN TRAVIS. PLEASE SAY GOSH DAMN, GOT DAMN  ANYTHING BUT GOD!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN TO CHURCH. YOU KNOW BETTER AT ANY AGE. I love you dearly but I wat to puke when you take God's name in vain.
🔥🔥
Funko pop has shirtless Jason Kelce figures! LOL
Travis will be in a Deadpool movie. Bet.
Respect to Travis taken responsibility for the second fumble by Mecole. That’s a great teammate move and will only make Mecole play harder.
As a Redskins fan I hate the new name just like every other fan of the team. We just say "Washington" instead of Commanders..
HOUSTON TEXAN OVER HERE! THANKS FOR ACKNOWLEDGING CJ and DeMECO ❤️💙 YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME
God I love you two! I mean jeez! I’ve been watching this pod cast since the first one! You two keep being you it’s much appreciated
Tops on the worldwide web!!!
How did you guys win that Nickelodeon award behind trav? (Congrats on the win and play hard against the ravens!❤️💛)
This episode was pure joy
Jason having a show on TLC or Food Network where he just goes to different tailgates (NFL, NCAA, etc.) would be one of their highest rated shows ever.
Jason talking about his feelings on combos is amazing.
I mean if you're just giving out free Signed Kelly Green Jerseys Jason I'd absolutely wear it all the damn time! I want to get one so bad in general!
Yes Cherry Pepsi is the best!!!!!
Jason, thank you for having the huge  heart that you have. 💚
Excitement great but Travis used fxxx or f-king word record breaking number of times.  Can tell Jason has young ears training him to reserve  use to necessary emphasis.  Enjoyed podcast.  You both are funny!
I need to see Jason doing a travel channel style show going to different tailgates every game! We need to see him at Lambeau!
24:30..........Trav downplaying this. Guarantee Bills Mafia was trolling him about Taylor. Thats what got him pissed off.
The hashbrowns are the best!!! He’s crazy😂😂
Jason your right about fountain soda. Love it!😊🍀
As someone who works in beverage sales, Travis was right about the bottles! No stadium/arenas allow glass bottles for the safety reasons😂
Before you retire Jason you have to tailgate with the Eagles fans that would be special
Bro!  Oklahoma Joes in KC goes hard!   Just a couple normal dudes from Ohio
Marv Levy was our coach when Kelly played, and yeah, the players were notorious for going to the Big Tree Inn. GM Bill Polian hated it as well 😂😂😂
Amazing podcast! Thanks for sharing your life with us, big hug from Frisco, TX!
The dog in the background on the couch makes my heart smile :)
Hell yea! Lets get it!
I 😂 cried laughing
Rookie mistake, indeed. A la cart, all day. The ONLY combo worth buying? Crave case. Respect the Castle 😶‍🌫️🧙‍♂️  Also, it sounds like you should have asked what was in that bowling ball shot, I don't know if that was all booze lmao
I am new to this channel and now I am hooked!!!  I raised 2 sons who are head high school basketball coaches and your relationship reminds me so much of my 2 sons who are great friends.  Keep up the good work boys and Travis, just get busy with Taylor already, tie the knot and start your family so Jason's kids can have some cousins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Go Chiefs!!!!!!!!
Jason and Travis,  You guys are idols to me and my younger brother. Our lives revolve around football and we're as close as can be. You our family laugh more then you will ever know and I can not show enough appreciation for you two,. Absolute goats.  Much love, AZ
It’s crazy our 3 RBs are the biggest personalities on the team.
Epic ad for McDonalds
Love the guys.  🇺🇸
Jason you can see your dog on the couch! I think he is use to hearing y’all talk, he is out!!!
Trav, you can get Botox for that sweating issue. Come see me in FL and I’ll do it for free. Fountain of Youth Med Spa in St Augustine 😊.
Oh, Travis did change his shirt. The yellowish grey tone of that sweatshirt he changed into is not as good for his skin undertone though....it does not "color him beautiful"....Travis seems to look best in clear colors.
What's the finger count on that Bowling Ball?
I saw a pic of Kylee and Taylor together and thought if you put bangs and red lipstick on Kylee they could pass for sisters/twins. or vice versa ! Both beautiful Women. :)
I absolutely love you guys!!!
Anyone know how to get these guys a message they would actually read? Iv got a really cool story I want to share of a young man who is a big fan of Jason's. Also thank you Jason and Travis for all you do for the Autism Community
He probably had to be drunk to be around Taylor lol
Laughing out loud with the Kelce boys is such healing energy.
I watched the Chiefs vs Bills game and loved all of it. Loved the Kelce bros energy on and off the field. This recap from the game is hilarious. Im literally laughing out loud!! You guys rock!!!!
MCDS has there own coke recipe and I tastes different than any other coke
Hi boys,I’m a Donna just like your sweet mom. You guys not only are great players,you have a great podcast ,but most of all great humans.I’m a retired special education teacher an what you to do for the kids an so many others show how your parents keep you grounded.👊❤️
Bears fan rooting for KC
I came to this podcast to see who this guy Taylor Swift was dating, but I stayed because these guys are seriously entertaining.
I’m starting to think that Travis is purposefully ignoring Taylor at all costs. That’s not a cute thing for a boyfriend. She flew to watch you and you didn’t even have the time to say anything except “She loves you”. You’re starting to sound (aka not sound) like her ex that wouldn’t talk about her. She wanted a relationship in the public and this is so disappointing to witness.  My home is 15 minutes from Highmark stadium but couldn’t get tickets to see you guys and Taylor. Every one of our friends with season tickets actually wanted to use them! Highly anticipated game. Ugh.  #GOBILLS
Hey guys. Could you talk more about the interaction between Jason and the little Taylor Swift fan. That whole situation just seemed so awesome!
Everybody has been waiting on this episode lol
As my gram would say "You can call me anything you want, just don't call me late for dinner!!" LOL-
Hey trav long time chiefs fan here. No Thanks on Mecole with the ball again we’ve seen enough.
Cat mom here, I know those injuries on Travis’ hands, not from cleats, they are from playing with a cat!  😻😂 Love the podcast!
Love you both
Queen Kylie geeeeeet the caaaaattt
Jason whenever you retire can you please come to an eagles tailgate
Jason I love McDonald’s coffee too. Just something about it.
Can we get a tour of where the guys record the pod?
SO agree on the wild cherry pepsi!
I have a Jason jersey I want signed. How would I go about getting it signed?
Sausage, egg, and cheese McMuffin is the best thing at McD’s.  And they have the best fountain Coke.
We would never throw FULL beer cans at anyone in Buffalo. It would be considered a total waste and completely against our alcohol way of life 😂😂!
Can we call Travis Charles Barkley? 14:25
Doggie looks dead
Can't wait for the chiefs ravens game going to be the game of the year!!
Do the Z man with texas toast next time trav!
Jason for President!
Cold can of coke is the goat.
No bottles, cans and they have to be opened at the concession stands.
Tailgate after retirement?  I'll drive!
I just call him Travis Maauto
I love Kylie  Kylie "dont embarass me" Jason-*takes shirt off* Kylie "tell jason get his ass in here"
Kelces liking wes anderson made my week
Yes, Cherry Pepsi 😊
Mahomes playoff game on the road….wasn’t his biggest games on the road…….super bowls
Mr. swift???
Not Cheesecake Factory...that shirt looks like a kitchen rug
They still sell glass bottles at ford field
I am disappointed Travis took away his books ....
That McMuffin is fire, it's my go to breakfast meal from McDonald's.
“ I wasn’t out there long enough to really even get my nipples going.” - Jason
I loved watching Jason having the ultimate fan experience. I was happy to see and hear all of the good comments about you instead of the hate. Brotherly love.
This is fucking awesome
lol not travis saying he’s favorite is a wild cherry pepsi while im sipping on a wild cherry pepsi 😂
Was 10 cent beer nigtht Indians vs Rangers
Tell the eagles to step up their game and get a locker room like the ravens and I'm sure other teams around the league with doors on every locker. Looks so much better that way
Bring Danielle on the podcast!
This is part of the charm, baby! 🤣🤣🤣
Fountain birch beer hits different with a slice of good pizza
The fact travis is wheeze laughing over jasons "trail" 😂😂😂
Jason Kelce for President!
"Daddy's boobs are out " LOL too cute ! When will the girls meet Auntie Taylor? Jason that shirtless move was priceless I'm still laughing !! LOL
Totally with Jason. Combo meals are rip-offs. Just get another/bigger burger.
'Tay said she absolutely loved you' ! Melt my heart so early in the day ! 🥰
Jason is my hero
You guys are hilarious 😂
as a Bills fan, you all made me feel better about the loss watching this episode!  This episode was ELECTRIC!
Love the pod cast love you guys but for real is that a Momma Kelce bobble head behind Travis? Catch myself always looking at it trying to figure it out.  We need a bobble head tour.
holy effing nice!
As an lol (little old lady) in my 60s, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you!  The way this podcast started out; talking about Travis’s pits = Well, we discussed Jason’s scent = he smells like a forest, a big, strong fir tree. I don’t think we’re going to touch Travis!   Jason - shirtless at the game! He’s a mountain of a man & made that beer can look teeny in his hand.   This entire podcast was a riot. Thanks for putting yourselves out there, you young men can certainly brighten up any dreary day.
Wait... there's people outside of the KC/midwest area who don't know what a cookie cake is??? WHAAAAAT?!?!
prime opportunity for McD's to introduce the Kelce Combo...
welcome to the mafia Jason! 😂
I love this podcast!!! I started watching football for Taylor, I stayed because I enjoy the games!!! Ready for Sunday ❤
how many clap,whistle,tapor hum lets go sports bar
Lots of commercial adds. But still enjoyed the show
My nephew Brendan Sorsby NOW A BEARCAT!!!!!!!!!
These guys are pure gold. Best humans!!
Can we please have McDonald’s create the Jason Kelce Combo - #62 Two sausage egg and cheese muffins with a large coffee (may be a surprise coke) 😂
Snows out Tits out My next tattoo
Excuse me?! No hashbrowns????? NO NO NO NO! All the MCYD’s hashbrowns!!!
IM WITH JASON ON THIS ONE! there is nothing better than a cold fountain coke. and cherry coke is way better than cherry pepsi !
"Snow's Out Tit's Out" -Buffalo Tourism's new slogan
These two make my day ! Every single week !😂 Pluse the body stops sweating when your dehydrated. Your good Travis.
I love the vid of Jason holding the young fan up to wave to Taylor Swift 👍👍👍 Jason Kelce for Mayor of Sea Isle City🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hash brown on the sausage egg and cheese bro rip half off and put it on each one
They know what’s up cherry coke the bomb 💣
"Jason Kelce charm"😂😂😂😂😂😂
Travis you missed a trick, you should have said to Josh Allen in the tunnel.. “because I’m naughty and I’m sneaky”
I listen to this podcast from Spain.  look forward to this podcast on Wednesdays now that I’m retired.  Can’t watch all games live due to the time difference 😢
GOT dayum, I absofuckinglutely 💗this podcast - makes my day so much brighter ! 😂🤣😂🤣
You guys always make my Wednesdays! You are the Best❤ Best Wishes from Germany✌️✌️
I love you two!!!!!   P.s.  not to pressure you Jason & I know you don’t give a 💩 about a Philly fan opinion. Please give it another year!!!!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼  if, not. You are such a great player for Philly. A  leader for the team. A terrific human. It’s been a honor to have you on the E.A.G.L.E.S 🦅🏈 #62 makes me nervous!   Good Luck to you Travis in playoff against Ravans. This team m
Jason has my heart, no hash brown just the sausage egg and cheese...the meal is a rookie mistake 😂
I literally go to McD’s just for the fries!!! and a coke 😂
Great as usual ❤
“They don’t hate us! I was with them, they love you!” Ooooh Jason.
You could see the ball get pushed to the right
Jason’s celebration should be on the cover of Madden 25
I love these two ! Always a great , entertaining show!! ❤❤
The Dog on Jason's Couch looks like he's living pretty good.
Great show guys
Great show guys!!! Go Chiefs beat those Ravens!!!
Totally here for the kelce bros extreme tailgate road tour
I was having an anxiety attack until the clock ran out.
Thank you fellow Northeast Ohioans! "POP."
The Broomall McDonald's is the best!
Omg Travis I’m with you on the ice cold Cherry Pepsi my favorite
😂😂 the Jason Kelce charm 😂
I think Jason and Bert Kreischer could be friends
I see these clips all the time but now am deff have this on my subscription on this love them no matter what an yes what u order is the best that’s the only thing I order on McDonald’s for breakfast when I get there period that the sh****😂😂😂😁😁 can’t wait to see what next…
Jason with his shirt off reminded me of David Puddy at the Devils game on Seinfeld ❤❤❤
Trav - I thought the heart was for Tay!
that entire press box is battling to see who can be the most annoying.  Attention Seekers commencement.
The star of this podcast is Jason’s Dog ❤ I had to rewind a few times cause I kept getting distracted 😂
My dream is to have a jason kelce signed jersy would love that im four years cancer free ive been a eagles fan all my life my husband is a cowboys fan
I love these two brothers
Ice cold Coke Zero is where it’s at fellas.
The Best podcast!!
😂😂😂I live in Jamaica and I laughed so hard watching this episode I believe all Jamaica heard my laughter, especially the chapter with Jason's response to Ky about being on his best behaviour 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I’m with you on the Pepsi
What does Travis’ hoody say?
Love how under every circumstance they both chose to talk good about people instead of make fun or talk down.  Class acts 🙌 love these guys!
It's the vax
Since the swifties showed up the no dumb questions that are dumb have increased 11,441%
Sausage and egg mcmuffin is best thing at mcdonalds AFTER you put the hash brown inside
Love the show but pls less cuss words
Once again, Jason spitting facts. Cherry coke> wild cherry pepsi
Thank you so much. Love the podcast. Diehard Eagle. Beautiful family. God bless. Catasauqua,Pa. Fly Eagles Fly.
Jason FN Kelce seeing you tailgating  is so Cleveland!! #216love
"Gotta know where your exits are" is that a zombieland quote from TK
Hey , it looks like Bolton knew it was going to be a fake punt. Is that true?
13 year old T Swift fan me would never believe I'd be here today watching a whole sports podcast. What a ride
We really need to hear Kylie’s version of events.
l am with Jason on combos NO
Loved it. ❤
I love the Mannings brotherly love... and Now you guys are my new faves.... I am so glad I was introduced to this podcast.
Is KFC still open?
Best episode!!! Love you guys!!!!
Accelerator is likely the pit stain culprit....
We love cookies!!!
Wild Cherry Pepsi 👍
Travis: I cry when I see you sometimes Jason: … I mean, everyone knows that Travis, we’re a crying family
You guys are the best!! The 2 G.O.A.T’s!!!! Jason, your kindness to Danielle is so awesome!!! Thank you!!! And, the funny in the room, your reaction at the game!!! Best shit ever!!! You rule!! Travis, man you rock!!! Congratulations on the win and I look forward to seeing you and the Chiefs at the SUPER BOWL baaabbbby!!
Another one of my favorite podcast.  - Cowboys fan.   Good luck Chiefs!
Come to Lambeau!!!
This just in Jason Kelce’s truck has been broken into repeatedly 😅😅
I was there I wasn’t to far it was amazing I’m bills fan and I’m Happy you got to enjoy it, you’re so accurate in how you described everything  !!!  So happy to be part of that moment when you retire come Back your offfically bills mafia
KC is the luckiest and most ref protected team in the last 5 years. Can't wait for Baltimore to knock them back into reality.
No combo meal?  Don't make me disown you Jason.
Jason and Travis MahAuto
Love the show, but would like to hear less ‘f….ing’ and GD….
There goes the Old Spice endorsement 🤣🤣
So happy to see there is another passionate person that loves wild cherry Pepsi, there is nothing better than a fresh cherry Pepsi. 🤘🏼❤️✨
McDonald’s has their own recipe of Coke, which is why it’s so much better!!! Just FYI, I love McDonald’s Diet Coke the best!
Why did they decide to do an 'adults only' podcast ? Why make it inapropriate for kids😂
I can’t believe you’re going to sit here and shit talk bills mafia Travis for speaking the truth and standing up for victims. Jackson mahomes is a sexually assulter- who assulted a girl at a bar on tape. Brittany defended HIM and humiliated the victim…. Stop defending people who shouldn’t be defended. As victims we can say the truth. Nothing that was “said” about his family wasn’t true, pull the tape up of him, better yet pull the comments Brittany said defending his behaviours.
McDonald's has the best cold fountain soda.
I’ve got a company in St. Joseph, Mo where training camp is that has made a sweatshirt of what u want to have a painting of Jason of shirtless!
Here’s how it went down in my house: “Mom! Jason Kelce ripped his shirt off and chugged a beer!” Me: “NO WAY boys! His wife would KILL him. You must be mistaken. It was probably someone who just looked like Jason. I mean, they are in Buffalo. Everyone in Buffalo looks like Jason.” Me sing the picture the following day: “oh yeah boys, you were right. I guess his wife didn’t kill him.” 😂😂😂
Shirtless Jason needs to be the new Bernie meme .
OMG!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 ❤❤❤❤ Gotta get the hashbrown!!!
I like the rule if the Defense recovers the ball.... I don't like the rule if it goes out of bounds.
I thought I was the only one who didn’t get the meal! 🤣 drink and the burger that’s it
This bills fan loves you trav❤️
Travis’ armpits must be leaking charisma because everything these brothers do just makes me love them more.
The Best duo in the world
Did I not get you one? Oh no 😂😂😂
“Holy fuckin… nice”
Need a shirtless Jason funko pop
Did Jason say:"...after 40 beers?"  🤣
Excessive use of the f word!  Do you talk like that around Taylor?  You have a lot of kid’s watching.
If I ever had a man crush... it is Mister Jason Kelce... lmao!  Way to represent Jason!   Greatest Eagle ever, even surprised Concrete Charlie from my hometown, Bethlehem, PA!  #FlyEaglesFly #hestrueblue  #drunkardthroughandthrough lol!  Cheers Jason, have fun!
Samesies with the cherry pepsi!! Love it!
With Ragnow injured, Jason should sign a two game contract with the Lions, to bring home one more ring before retirement
I love you guys…..way to go Jason at Buffalo and Travis all the best for the next one…..you brothers should be on 1 team…..Much love, peace!!
Get the McMuffin and put the hash brown on the McMuffin. Game changer!
Nothing like a cold McDonald’s fountain COKE 😊😊😊
The biggest question I have is did Bowles and TB not know they had a timeout left and just made a horrible excuse of why he didn’t use it? Below is exactly how that last possession by the Lions played out. If Bowles did the right thing he would have called time out after the rushed victory formation by Goff at 0:37  TB & Lions game 1:31 left on TB 29 yard line  1st down victory kneeled @ 1:31  2nd down victory kneeled @ 1:06 with 16 seconds on play clock 3rd down victory kneeled @ 0:37 with 14 seconds on play clock   So even if TB waited to call time out on 3rd down because of Goff not taking his time and letting the play lock run out. With 36 seconds left if immediately TB called a time out. They could have had “a chance” to go 64 yards and get a td then still need a 2pt conversion.   4th down and Lions would have to kick the field goal which was a 48 yarder. It’s not a chip shot from 48. Patterson was 15-17 field goals this year, his longest from 52 yards. So he could have missed from the pressure.   If they miss(which it could happen we saw if all playoffs even in a dome) TB would have around 31-32 seconds and ball at the 36 yard line of Lions.  64 yards for a touchdown and 36 seconds isn’t ideal, but you have it take a chance.
I'm writing in Jason Kelce on my 2024 ballot
You’re saying it wrong. It’s cowgirls
You guys are great.   Love it
as a mexican we grow with soccer and I will say I never got the football thing well thanks to Taylor im in and now i can spend time with my son and fight cz he doesn’t like chiefs 🤣🤣 what a fun experience this has been and I dont claim i know everything about the sport for those horrible haters but im for sure enjoying this sport
These guys are the best
I don’t watch or listen to podcasts. This is my first sub.
Pop! Spoken like a true Ohioan! McDonald's always has the best Cokes!
Eagles fan for life flyeaglesfly
Jason doesn’t believe Travis’ hand scratches are from cleats, he’s gonna investigate and maybe thinks it’s from “something” else “meow”
Hopefully the pro bowl listens to y’all’s input!!!
Calories per dollar,  this new for me 😂😂😂
Time sure flies when you're tanked!!! :-)
Day has been made!  Laughing like a fool at my desk, at work listening to this 🙂
Travis, I’m not sure that your a Fall. (That yellow/gold/green suit.) I think you’re more a Summer,… 😘❤️ ❤️you still!
Billy idol did rebel yell.    Jason you went into history.   I know Travis is big yeti.  But your big brother.  Your celebration for Travis wide open touchdown was a big yeti yell.    To be bad we can't get Billy idol to rewrite the words for this.  ❤❤❤❤ you rock big brother.  Travis best dam game I've seen in years.
First impression--- No where to go but up
Get Trav a deodorant sponsorship
Snow’s out, tits out 🤣
Per Travis' game day fit for the Buffalo game, he is the new stylish villain "Chief Gucci Sailor" for #aquaman3.
Travis out here lookin’ like Mick Foley
Aside from Coach Reid, Coach Harbaugh is my next favorite. That’s how Coaches ought to be, serious and disciplinarian but fun after the job is done.
Super Brow Brothers. Those things are healthy.
Vince Wilfork catching punts was an awesome way to close out practices.
Absolutely nothing better than a sexy sweaty yeti ❤️💛
You guys are such a shot of joy and fun!  We need you  year round!❤
Classic scummy bills fans
Stop drop and roll doesn’t work when you get blown up 😅😂
I didn’t like the tailgaters burning Taylor’s picture!Karma came to bite them in the butt! 27 is my lucky number! And my birthday is December 13th!
Frank Ragnow is from Arkansas, and was electric here too! Great call Jason👏👏👏
A great idea for a show when both Jason and Travis are retired Kelce brothers crash the tailgate where they hit all 32 stadiums 2 a week and tailgate with the fans
Jason please take your own bowling ball to drink out of in Baltimore. I once read that bowling ball holes have the most diverse bacterial colonies ever examined. But then Everclear probably takes care of those?
I was listening on my podcast player of choice and never would have known Travis was sweating so badly he had to change his shirt if he hadn’t mentioned it, but now here I am
Jason on the field: legendary Jason off the field: even more legendary.
To bad you couldn't play one year with Travis on the Chiefs before retiring😢.
Still watching but curious was that heart & smooch 💋blown up to TS or to the fans?
"Jason you're meeting you're brothers girlfriend for the first time (who is the biggest star in the world) what are you going to do" Jason " I'm gunna take my tits out and jump out this window"
I'm still concerned that Kylie may have strained her eyes with all the rolling that had to be going on.
One of the best ones!!! Definitely winning the internet today! If you don’t love these guys…what are you even doing!
Travis : “Call me what ever you want… just don’t call me “Maauto”….”
Long live The Kelces
I love this show, you guys.... So many young people are watching now if only Travis  Could find another word besides f#*%😊
am i the only one distracted by Jason’s dog? so cute
I tried to watch live and stupid work got in the way. 😂
I need to see Travis doing Harbaugh's dance in the endzone on Sunday.
Travis's game day fit makes him look like henchmen #1
Wild cherry Pepsi is the bomb….
If Danielle sees this, she will freak out!! 🤗
Yes! Cherry Pepsi is SO good!
So I see that Jason can gifts for Jason but Jason can’t bring jeans for Jason 👀
Wild Cherry Pepsi. Travis got it right.
Lol "Help me baby Jesus! IM ON FIRE!
Anders and his brother Daniel (also an NFL kicker) both played for Auburn and are from Alabama.
Day 365 of asking intern Brandon to make the merch available to ship to Canada💀
Let's all pitch in to get Jason a decent cup of coffee, for goodness sake.
Best moments 😂😂 59:29, 59:56, 01:05:13 😅😅😅😅 I can't breathe 😅😅😅😅   thank you guys ♥️♥️
Jaosn Kelce is that one guy, everyone wants to be friends with. Love this channel
I have a dumb question....Is being a regular center vs a long snapper really that different?  Can the starting center do both?  It would free up a 53 man roster spot
My mom's best friend met Jason in a brewery in bfe Missouri.  I go quite a bit through the summer. My mom told me and I didn't believe her. She had a picture with him and I'm still jealous even after months of knowing... I hope to meet you there one day if you're ever there again 😂 freaking Bucyrus of all places 😂 I've literally worked half a mile from Mahomes old house,  been in and around kc for 5-6 years and have yet to even see a Chiefs player but she meets Jason in a town of like 6 people in the sticks in the middle of a cow pasture meeting a dude who plays in Philly 😂
If you let Bills Mafia shenan once, theyre gonna shenanigan
Crazy this thing has over 200,000 views but only 26K likes.  Hit that like button people keep them on top
As a member of Bills Mafia that’s was the best moment with Jason and the Bills Mafia but my Guy Travis is a dog respect ya game bro 💯💪🏾
Couldn't ask for a better 21st bday present
You guys NEED to go to Green Bay!!
Should have shown the Pacheco memes 😂 those are GOLD 😂
I don't buy meal combo's either for almost the same thing. I'm glad it's not only me! LMAO!
😅 1:26:09 Beatin Taylor all over the living the evening prior.
I'm a military 🪖 spouse and I'm learning how is football game play. Thank you for you guys work .
agreeing with Travis - the hash brown is a MUST HAVE!
best episode ever! Love the brotherly banter
Its always sausage egg cheese mcmuffin!
TRAVIS....I'm with You;  McDonald's has the Best Hashbrowns, hands down. BAM!
Seems to me that Jason is and will be a Bills fan for life!
I can definitely see Travis in a heist movie. Will definitely watch that in the movie house. 😊
I always look forward to Wednesday because of you two! Love listening to the two of you.
👏😂👏😂
Shit 🤦🏻‍♂️ on my way to McDonald’s there goes my diet lol   Double quarter pounder with cheese in a à la carte large fry.  And Praying for free ice cold Coca-Cola.
Ewww Travis, go change. Anyway got a new Wednesday routine. Make a cup of coffee, make a toast , phone shove across my face about 2 1/2 inches away from my face(I’m near sighted)and watch you guys.
Cleveland kids and Buffalo / Niagara kids meet on the lake (junior sailing), on the ice (travel hockey) and on the slopes (Holiday Valley and Holimont racing) so, of course we connect on a deeper level!
These two are international treasures. Much ❤ from Canada!!
Jason needs to write a “Jason Kelce’s Guide to Life” - no combos, no scented candles, and so on, all with the reasoning behind  his nuggets of wisdom.  I’d put it on my coffee table.  😂
Can we call you Maaurto? 😂😂
Kelce little brod the bills lmao I don’t hate u like u hate us lmao
I couldn't watch live :(. New Heights road trip tailgate party should be on everyone's retirement bucket list.
I'm with Wy and it's Uncle Travyyyyy!
Kelce brothers tailgates
Danielle, cute story and all but giving Jason photos of yourself is kinda creepy. And do you want him to keep them all? 😂
Not wrong about the wild cherry Pepsi. A close second is glass bottle coke
McDonald's has a special method they use to make their Cokes. It tastes better than any other restaurants Cokes.
Travis, please think about your language and the fact that little ears are listening to you!
Cmon Nah, we know there has been a cat incident!!! Get Sherlock on it!
W
"STOP, DROP AND ROLL SON" - Kelce, Jason
8:05 oh wait nvm I thought you were talking about a mc griddle lol
Travis is so real for saying the hashbrown is McDonalds best menu item
Jason had 2 national news feel-good stories...the McDonald's story and the story about carrying the little girl at the game to the suite window so Taytay could see. ❤❤❤
Best brothers EVER!
Lolol we order the same 7:49
Jason, welcome to bills mafia
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  You guys are on fire with this podcast it is my absolute favorite thing to watch on YouTube to listen to on Spotify I love you guys so much and my number one dream is to meet both of you   New heights, fan forever, Chiefs, fan forever, Kelce family fan forever I wish you guys all the best  ❤❤❤❤❤
The Bills logo is a wild buffalo charging .. to the right. Time to mirror the logo to face left
They bundle it for you.  If you order each thing.
I love that they veer off into trivia like in the mob movies.
Wild Cherry Pepsi is my go to!
My husband has been a Chiefs fan for 30 + years. These 2 are amazing!! Their podcast has me laughing every time!!😂 The McDonalds debate was awesome!! Great human beings!! Jason should be a sport commentator in his retirement!
Where did all these fans commenting about a tailgate show come from? No chance 15 people randomly just had the same idea. What it pop up on Reddit or something?
And a Fountain coke FROM MCDONALDS! Their water filtration makes the Coke extra amazing!!🤩
Once, I asked my mom if she wanted me to bring her anything from Whataburger and she said, "I'm going to request a salad, but I want you to accidentally bring me a Whataburger jr. with cheese, " lol
Love Jasons doggo just living their best life in the background 😂❤❤
"Tay" says she absolutely loves you...."Tay"...how gay and immature can you be as a professional football player?
“Sippin on peath paradith” 😂
What is the 92%?
You guys just made my day watching this!, LMAO tears running down my face.
I never seen a clout chaser more than Jason Kelce
As a Bills die hard fan, I am so glad you had the time of your life in such a great stadium.
President Kelce
we need "Jason does Buffalo" merch
Dr Pepper > pepsi > coke
That should be a show!!! Tailgating with the Kelces! Show will be you all going to all the stadiums and giving a score!
49ers fan here. Gotta subscribe to this podcast 😂
Get a HB and put it on the sandwich chefs kiss.  😊
Love that Travis calls it Oklahoma Joes still. True KC Native energy.
It was a HORRIBLE time for me to learn that fumbling into your own end zone is a turnover. What the actual EFF?
00:10:00 Real sugar Coke with ice and lemon slice is perfection. I'm sworn of coca-cola in my regular life because I've no control when it comes to that sweet sweet nectar of the gods but dammit if I'm on vacation it's on
Here is Kylie and proud as hell looking on!
This is the best episode. 🥰
Love you guys!! Been waiting for this week’s newest episode🎉
Why didn't Jason bring home the Yeti shirt for Jason.. lol
You guys should add a segment to the podcast called talking tailgates, tailgate stories, history, etc. would be great 😀
Jason such a nice guy 🫶😃greetings from Berlin, got a jesery with #62 go for a US president please!
Someone alert the Travel Channel - Kelce brothers do tailgating needs to be picked up once they both are retired.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣You guys crack me up🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was 16 at a UGA college home game & ended up on the witness stand in court…..pregnant lady got hit with a beer glass bottle and another fan stitches on his face…..no more glass & alcohol at UGA……so it turned into ziplock bags taped to legs and between boobs. Can be dangerous for sure!
JASON FOR PRES 2024
No mention at all of the best QB in the CFL. Come on boys!!! It was nice to see Zach having fun before we get going.    If you want to see good atmosphere, come to Winnipeg for the 2025 Grey Cup. Maybe Taylor could perform too…..
Jason, you stole the show on Sunday!  Travis, I am so proud of you and the entire Kansas City Chiefs organization. Let's go back to the Super Bowl!!!! Thank you for being incredible role models for our generation!
Someone made a funko pop
Pop! Grew up in northwest Pennsylvania don’t hear pop unless I’m visiting family there
Jason’s an absolute legend, he’s definitely from the 216, we do this stuff on the daily, well minus doing it in front of the biggest star on the planet. Amazing boys
agree with Jason: Sausage McMuffin with egg is the best
I'm disappointed Jason didn't do the podcast shirtless. It's his new calling card.
Hasbrowns are the best thing they have!
New heights needs to bring back the madden bus and tailgate nfl games for the retirement plan
13:56
Jason should pursue a career in the WWE when he retires from the NFL 😂
First thing I noticed was Jason's upside down dog, not Travis's pits lol
What about if we call you moauto
Truth...mc-muffin🎉
Not the horse dog just vibing on the couch
Too many whites in the heights..Lol!!
Is that a dog sleeping behind Jason lol? He hasn't moved lmao
Get Josh Allen on the pod! Would be awesome
Holy cut scenes.
YES the Commanders is the worst. It's awful 😔 and Washington Redskins is my team. Please let the Native Americans decide it's their name and no one else. I have nothing but respect for them.
I LOVE the idea of these two, plus partners, going on a road trip tailgating once they aren’t playing.  I am not sure if they can do such a thing if they are injured but still in payroll.  I love the idea of the Kelce family (including their parents) touring NfL tailgates and, if possible, legendary college tailgates. I am certain we would be laughing more than we do watching @realandycohen getting @andersoncooper drunk each NY Eve.
Kylie: Jason we’re meeting Taylor today be on your best behavior. Jason: be on my BEAST behavior? Got it!
Let's get to you taking your shirt off 😅😅❤❤🎉🎉
Fountain Coke from McDonalds is the best.  They have the syrup DIALED IN.
Never knew how much I needed to see yall at each other’s games until now😭🤣 shout out to Jason for being an absolute icon
When they retire.  The should broadcast NFL games together.  Not what the Mannings are doing.
Def one of my fav football moments of all time…. Jason Kelce TURNT the fuck up!!!! 😂LFG Chiefs!!!!!
Anyone else notice one of the dogs just sprawled out to the world on the couch😂😂😂
Combo nonsense 😅
So basically Jason really wanted to cheer for Buffalo
I remember going to an Eagles game in Philly when I was 17 and they were throwing D cell batteries from the upper deck.
GO Chiefs!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Probably should have just left out the part about patricks brother😬 we all saw the video js i still love you thou
I wish the bills could play in London every year, the bills mafia are amazing!! Best fan base we've had over here, they've definitely made me want to go to a home game too. Tourism boards need to make the most of the international games
Code for Accelerator doesn't work.  Another great podcast!
Need to get Jim Kelly on the show!
IDEA for consolation gift for Mecole.  Maybe a pair of any Concert Tickets he wants.
The AI Generated Pops of his shirtless cheer are pure magic!!!
honestly the best podcast episode in a long ass time
That’s right Jason it’s POP 😂😂😂
I wanted them to talk about the Swiftie fan Jason helped but regardless great show.
MEXICAN COKE is the best
Imagine a McDonald worker just going through their shift and then Jason show up in the drive-thru and give you a signed jersey.
He keeps the fans photos 😭
Not gonna lie when Travis said Joe’s barbecue I genuinely thought he was talking about Jones barbecue and foot massage
Value menus are a scam he’s right. Get two sandwiches a water and if you still need a side get it. The soda is marked up like 1000%
These two make it fun again. Down to earth, real people.
Just sitting here watching and smiling…they are awesome!
Jason  I love you man! You are something else! Loved you having such a great time. I love your show, watching it every Wednesday! Want to be on the fan page!
Value menus are a scam he’s right. Get two sandwiches a water and if you still need a side get it. The soda is marked up like 1000%
WILD CHERRY PEPSI! Best ever! Also if you go to sonic and get an iced cherry sprite or cherry coke they add the cherry so it’s top tier 🏆
Dads showing his boobs haha 😂😂😂😂 This is one of my favorite episodes. I always look forward to Wednesday with you guys. This is literally the only podcast I watch and will continue to watch and support. You both have my vote for president 🫡🏈🐐❤️
Trisha from Ireland, I Iove you guys for the entertainment factor, the way you poke fun at each other as well as yourselves and react to games including your own and don't shy away from analysing your own games and how you played. Entertaining  full of  craic. Class 💚
Yessss Travis!!! Cherry Pepsi is the best!!
I am with Jason- no combos. I love ala carte too.  Plus they never have the kind of soda I like.
Jason doesn't worry about calories..except  calories per dollar 😅😅
McDonald's and Coke and Pepsi are forever grateful for free publicity lol  But in true McDonald's fashion they fucked up the order hahaha
Travis, Can you show close up of bobble heads?
Jason, it was great to see you having fun. I’m glad you got to relax, blow off steam, and celebrate all at once!
Love the dog on the couch
Mcd has the best crispy cokes. The best. Not the same anywhere else.
Marv Levy baby!!
I agree... Sausage Egg & Cheese McMuffin is the Shit... Man of the People..
Kelce Bros Tailgate Tour would be a great streaming series
Ohhhhhh.....fountain coke....coke syrup.....mexican coke...with the real good sugar
jason is correct. it’s pop
Heck yah to tailgate at every  game as a retirement plan!
I'm glad bills mafia gave you the best experience. Respect to you and Travis.
The Cleavland beer bottle game... didn't the coach get on the mic and tell the croud "We're not in Cincinnati!!"
35:28 I couldn’t agree more, I’m glad you guys still like the rule after it didn’t go in the Chiefs favor. It benefited the Chiefs in the 2020 divisional round against the Browns, game-changing play.
These two guys are too funny 😂
These two……this was the best pod cast ever!
The only Eagle I can listen to is Jason! Coming from a 40 year Niner fan…. This guy is just living his best life!
When I'm having a rough day.... I just find some New Heights vids to help me change my mood and perspective 😁 Love these guys!!
Wild cherry pepsi.. yesss!! Lol 🤤
Great episode, guys! Ever think about how many people are praying for the Chiefs??  I mean, that’s a lot of real good prayer 🤗
Travis with everyone’s opinion on the hashbrowns. 😂😂😂
McDonald’s hash brown is goated
Love the story about the jersey to the lady at the drive thru.  Class act.
15:15 Get him to ask people if they "Want a fish sandwich?"
Travis, I was eating breakfast and then you showed your sweaty as fuck pits and started talking about them spraying. 🤢 I didnt want to finish my burrito anyway. 😂
Epic entertainment
McDonalds has good  coffee
Love You Guys!!! Jason is something Special ❤😂😂😂
I wish the Chiefs fans in the stands had Jason's experience. The walk back to the car was sketchy. I was fine but when grown ass men are attacking my wife, that shit isn't cool. 80% of Bills Mafia was awesome, the other 20% are table snapping garbage people.
oakland raiders threw batteries!!!!!!!!!!
Kylie says she is going to get the cat. "I'm doing this" Bahahahahahahaha
He needs the calories😢😢😢😢
GO KYLIE, GO GET THAT CAT, WE WANT AN UPDATE THE NEXT EPISODE
Jason is so right, Breakfast sandwiches are the best.
Travis (speaking on the cookie cake):  "A treasure map to the promise land" .....Im cryin 😂😅🤣😂😉
WE NEED KYLIE
Jason has Bills Mafia energy and I'm here for it.
Who calls you mahado
Netflix or someone should hire on Jason to do a all teams stadium tour. Each team/stadium has an episode. Does the same thing he did in Buffalo. Would be cool to see how each teams fans hang and do it.
bittersweet momento for those who are Bills fans and 92%ers....
McDonald’s!??BESTIE THE BOYCOTT
Can we get a "snows out, tits out" out kelce shirt? 😂
NO HASHBROWN C'mon. Cherry Coke for the WIN for sure
How fast did McDonald's call for a new commercial.
After you jumped out. you do realize the cop outside the suite said, "He is INSANE!"
Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and form your own sandwhich + a Latte is the move fellas
imagine if the brothers teamed up and won a bowl together 😂
😊love you guys
I never skip the ads! They’re almost just as entertaining as the segments 😂
Absolutely enjoyed this podcast so much!!
Cherry Pepsi all the way!!
Come to Lambeu Field for a great tailgate experience!
How do they not talk about Jason lifting that little girl to see Taylor Swift!? Such a wholesome memory! Really surprised they didn’t touch on that!
❤
Jason - you are true to yourself!!  I think it is great you took off your shirt to meet Taylor.
Bills Mafia has adopted Jason. Just be aware as you have no choice. Muahahahaha
Yes when you are both retired take the Podcast to a game each week and tailgate with Fans.
If jason with his shirt off doesn’t get him sexiest man alive I don’t know what does!!!!
Go ravens, go lions.
Great job guys
Shush your mouth  with your Pepsi talk, sir!!
My gosh I am late to the podcast had to do therapy LOL. These brothers are not only what we needed in the world of sports but in LIFE!! Travis taking blame for the touchback and Jason just being. All OUT in a hostile yet appreciative environment !!n LOVE you guys and Brandon 2
The love I have for this show.
I'm with Travis, hashbrowns are the BEST thing on the whole menu!
I'm with Travis, the McDonalds Hash Browns are incredible.
I already liked it even before watching it 😂👏🏽because I knew it would be good, as always.😆
Girl scout cookies are awesome
❤love you guys!❤
This Episode’s Swear Jar Count  Jason: 3 F bomb Travis: 65 F bombs “Alright Nah”s 15  Season 2 Swear Jar Count (not including bonus vids)  Jason: 116 F bombs Travis: 1312 F bombs “Alright Nah”s 245
No hash browns - Travis "what the hell is wrong with you?" LMAO
Yo trav is looking more like jason every week 😂 that beard game going hard trav
Kylie: 'This man...' 😆
Let’s go trav. I drink a very unhealthy amount of cherry Pepsi’s lol
Are u crazy announcing what McDonalds u go to? Lol I mean I’m sure Broomall will appreciate the business but now people are going to stalk that store Philly is crazy!
Damnn was hoping to hear about the little girl you picked up to see Taylor!
😂
Stan The Man Musial always had signed baseballs and photos in the trunk of his car. Came in handy when meeting a big fan!
What was mama kelce saying during this? Also did you get yelled at by wifey when you got home?
This family is the new Kardashians
In California they sell plastic Beer bottles
Travis is so silly and hyper on this episode 😂😂
Lived in Kansas! Joes Zman is the best. Bordain had this place as top 10 places to eat before you die
Jason was hilarious with no shirt, no shame at this last game😂🎉
Travis made multiple “Jason playing politics” comments. Dude is going to be the Philly Mayor a decade from now.
jason is preaching just impeccable facts on the mickey d's stuff
Whats a bracket?
Jason you were great at the game last week❤
I've been waiting for this one since Jason jumped out the suite lol
Kelce/Fitzmagic 2024!
No cans. Even at swift concert we had to pour into cups
Please,  bring Kylie back to talk about her experience on Jason bringing the house down.
McKelce meal incoming
I love when Travis says "Soda, eh?" I'm from Mini-soda, and I appreciated this A LOT! Thanks Big Yeti.
Best item is the McGriddle
Sausage egg and cheese McMuffin with a side of breakfast sauce all the way!!!!
I can totally see Jason Kelce rep Coca-Cola and Travis rep Pepsi - lol
Nooooooo. Got to have SEC  on the BISCUIT
Why if the offense fumbles and the ball moves forward it is a penalty but it moves forward into the end zone it is a turnover?
I'm curious, where do the families of the home team sit during the game?  The families of the away team? Does each organization do it differently?
Our waiter at Olive Garden gave us a sprite instead of water. Best sprite I’ve ever had.
I was raised on football and was an avid fan for 30 years. After my dad passed I lost interest. The Kelce brothers have peaked my interest again and I watched my first game in 10 years. That was one of the best games I've ever watched!
Why do we bleep out swearing in the promo clip but don’t do it in the rest of the show?  Come on guys. I check every week to see if we have started doing this, had hope after that promo.
Man vs. Tailgate
First, yes, you guys have a super funny informative podcast. I enjoy it. One thing bugs me though. You guys are benefitting and are always praised, but Taylor gets hate and has suffered since the start when she was having the best year ever. I believe there are toxic forms of feminism as well as toxic male behavior in all fairness and this awfulness is beyond me. All because she is a woman. I read a study of female celebrities and the more successful and more attractive the more they are insulted and hated on. Carrie Underwood was told she looked like a drag Queen and ugly as soon as she started dating a hockey player, and even Beyoncé has been insulted, and when her daughter was insulted for her looks and dancing….I had to stop looking at anything about her or Taylor. I love both artists and cannot deal with this hate and especially how the haters want to get you to break up. Just a little insight here for you. The world has gone backward in this department. I guess the man is the prize still Jonathon….not!!
It seems like the Dallas Cowboys have a rivalry with everyone.
So much stuff in that locker and you are telling me there isn’t one pair of jeans?
McDonald's Coke smacks.. Undefeated, Can't be beat. Also Cherry Coke > Cherry Pepsi all day, everyday
Someone at that McDs is definitely gettin fired.
Got to love the doggo crashed out on sofa behind Jason.
Jason, I think you were possessed by beer!
Cherryyyyy pepssiiiii
50:28 I love that Jason was able to just kick back and have fun. He deserves it!!  And I love it for us that we got to watch him having the time of his life. He definitely helped bring a special energy to that game!  ❤
Sorry, Trav. Wawa has the best hash browns.
Chiefs played bills 3rd stringers
Big Bird
I've been waiting for this episode since Sunday 😂 love them don't want this to end
You guys are great but Ravens fan here sorry have fun in Baltimore!
Greetings from Nigeria❤
You 'guys' or the Philly way 'Youse Guys' make me day. Sincerely K Berks County Pennsylvania 🤗
Lol just give it to the receptionist
Jason’s dog just chillin on his back on the couch made my morning
Love the Kelce brothers! Best podcast yet! Proud Bills fan living in Cleveland.   Glad Jason enjoyed his Bills mafia experience! I hope next time you mention the fan you lifted up to meet Taylor! #billsmafia
Thanks!
Travis is right!!! You have to get the hash browns Jason!!
Hey Travis get that beard trimmed love.
We love you guys😍😍😍😘
❤❤ I watch that game from start to finish and let me just tell you I loved seeing Jason there. I loved seeing Kylie and I love seeing my boy Travis your family is awesome and you make the world a better place ❤❤
If you're serious about getting that painting you should commission TaraLeighArtCo. She's a local buffalo artist!
Jason really said if it ain’t broke don’t fix it, my last bad first impression worked pretty good so how bad can this be
Travis might be drinking too many energy drinks. caffeine activates the central nervous system, turning on sweat glands (the more caffeine you drink, the more you sweat). Side note: I’m a painter Trav, what size canvas? 😊
Please tailgate the Ravens game Jason!🤣
“‘Tay’ said she absolutely loved you… “😍😍😍
Jason doesn’t understand the combo
Travis’ laugh took me out 🤣
As a bills fan, thank you for a game we’ll never forget…. Hate the fact Bass is getting harassed over it, and y’all getting harassed at/before/after the game! Best of luck KC
“I go à la carte.” At McDonald’s made me chuckle!
Mè n jason eat same breakfast every morning. Without hasbrown much cheaper. Gotta get the coke though. Research McDonald's coke.
Hey, travis, you're awesome, but if you'd slow down on the f bombs, more people would listen..
Bert and Jason should party in the suite on sunday
I would watch the travel show of these two just tailgating in every state.
You guys are the best
The game was intense i loved it!
Lol bro says he feels like a piece of shit for getting a Cole meanwhile 2 sausage eggs McMuffins haha atleast you don’t get Diet Coke with that order
MCDONALD SODA IS THE BEST! NOTHING IS BETTER THEN THAT!
Come back to a game when your brother is not playing, please.
JASON FOR PRESIDENT!
This is the prolly one of the only times I don’t agree with Jason you gotta go hash brown and you gotta go fires
You ruined my day Travis GO BILLS
Great Show ❤❤❤❤
Jas will never be constipated.
I would love a jersey signed jersey from both of you for my man cave please an thank you
Biggest discussion!! Coke vs Pepsi - Me Diet Cherry Coke = LOVE!!!
Do they say pop in Ohio or Philly?!?! I thought it was just WNY!
we dont hate you Jason lol
Literally the only podcast I don't speed through the ad reads. 😂
Jason’s turn to host SNL!! Call him Lorne!! Please!!
As a Diehard Eagles fan, i find myself pulling for Big Red and Trav. Despite the heartbreak last season i hope they pull it off
Need Kylie's pov of Bill's game and Jason's behavior 😂😂 okay and we just need more Kylie on the show❤
Jason, you 100% need to be at Travis’s next game
Love the podcast, Love the Kelce family, Love Taylor and it's been a pleasure to see the fan support this season. Special mention for the Etsy recommendation for Valentine's Day. I adore that site and found two gifts I could not decide between so I got them both. Big Thanks to you guys!!
Oh man I love these guys!!  This is what sports talk should be. Just bullshitting having fun. Loving life. Everything I love about sports!
McDonald's has their own recipe of coke and it is the best coke except for the real sugar Mexican coke.
Hash brown lol he missing out
Jason screaming shirtless holding a beer should 100% be on a t-shirt
Need a redesign on those short sleeved shirts!! Please make some with three-quarter sleeves PLEASE! Us older-er women like 3/4 sleeves please!
Travis you only tip 25% come on read the room brother  with what you make with good service it must be 75% or more
Hey CocaCola marketing geniuses….you should create a Kelce special … mixed from the Coke Freestyle machines. #cocacola #coke
Travis is soooo correct! Iced cherry Pepsi is the best!
Micky D's has the best Coke....it taste like cinnamon, no other place taste like that.
Hey Alexa Play “worst behavior” by Drake
A McDonald's Coke is something else. 🤣
Even Sexy Batman and The Big Yeti know that McDonald's Coke Hits Different!!! It's the best Coke on the Planet!!! 🌎 You can make any Coke drinkers day by grabbing them Coke from McDonald's. Just don't get them Sprite from McDonald's because then they'll know you're trying to kill them 🥤🙌🏽🥤🙌🏽🥤🙌🏽
At McDonald’s, I like to order a McPotato Patty and see how long it takes the cashier to figure out what that means. 😅😂
Gotta get the hash brown…Travis is right! Half goes in each sausage egg and cheese McMuffin….absolutely McLicious!!!!
Travis trying to hide his sweaty pits is hilarious! Drink some water bro!
Best center of all time and he still has to park his truck outside in the elements.
I thought you went by Maauto now
They've said electric like 74838 times
Hello handsome gentlemen. Jason made my day with his man boobs out.😅😅😅😅
You are so right about McDonald's and the calorie per dollar and those are their best breakfast sandwich
Sausage egg & cheese is the best thing McDonalds has, the hashbrown is 1B.
Okay Travis love this show but ease up on the FBombs we’re Christian’s on here too
He could do the podcast without a shirt
How dare Kelce talk about kc Joe's bbq ugh...
5:31 you scared her? lol dedded
I laughed so much! This might have been my favorite episode!
lets go travis bring the sb back to kc babyyyy
That's your first Retired season of New Heights. New Heights 'on the road' just traveling around the NFL to the Tailgates.
Now, I can continue with the rest of my work week after listening to these two. I always look forward to Wednesdays. ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅
There is a bakery in KC making Jason Kelce shirtless cookies!
Maauto
A warm welcome to Baltimore guys, from a 92%er Baltimorean! Jason I hope you (Taylor and Kylie) are all coming to the game on Sunday.  Good luck Chiefs (& Ravens)! ❤💜🖤🏹
JASONNNN. WAWA IS THE BEST COFFEE IN PHILLY. NOT MCDONALD'S. 😂😂😂 plus the best soft pretzel...
This is my # 1 Podcast 🎉 I just love these guys!  Thanks for keeping it REAL ❤️🏈❤️
I have (created) a wild cherry pepsi with shot of blastin berry cherry kool aid. Liquid heroin.
Mcds coke is amazing!
That's right Jason!  It's POP!
I love the dog sleeping on the couch behind Jason!! So cute!!!
We need a Kelce brothers tailgating show
Jason’s way of ordering McDonald’s is the right way. Combo’s are a scam.
It’s on the combo menu.. you wouldn’t get that!! 😂 I’m also a huge fan of an ice cold wild cherry Pepsi
Question.  I’m a chiefs fan but it looks like the NFL already knows who is going to be in the Super Bowl?
Can we get a recurring segment ? We can call it "Kylie’s version“ i imagine her apologizing to Taylor every two minutes.
Phenomenal 🎉
Texan here…Dallas’s problem starts at the top Jerry and his son.  No hope for them, ever.
Yep, ice cold wild cherry Pepsi is the best.
Where did Travis' books go?? The bookshelf is empty! Are you re-organizing to make room for something else? Different books? More trophies? Maybe some records? ;) #nodumbquestions
Jason is the perfect fit for modern-age television.
The people who work concessions have to open the bottles, even water, bottles and cans, can be used as weapons we’re not allowed to give caps. I worked concessions when my daughter was in high school for her band at the Raymond James Stadium.
Not all Bills fans are rude sorry they were jerks
I see someone is making a bobble head of shirtless Jason
👏🎉🎉
Jason with the insight...first the candles and now the value meals 😂
So, Pro Bowl sounds like a semi- football themed school Field Day. 😂
Get rid of the beard Travis
this is an all time great episode 😂
We gotta get trav a cheerwine
Sucks Travis beat us but I'm glad Jason had fun :) Go Bills!
Mc Donalds coke is the best ❤  Love your podcast Kelce bros!
Shout out to Lake Erie!!! Erie county PA here! 👏🏻
The first family of the NFL.  These 2 plus Momma and Kylie ❤
He said calories per dollar 😂😂😂😂
I just wanna say that Kylie was smiling watching him scream and jump ! ❤️
Love the Ladies Man shoutout. “Can I interest you in a fish sandwich”? 😂
my Picks;  travis +100 mahomes +350 rice + 150 KT + CATCH  Chiefs Win by 14 points.
Not enough calories per dollar might be my favorite quote of all time man 😂😂😂
@Billsmafia let's send Jason a table!!!!!!!! Lol
The coke at McDonald’s is the best just like their coffee…maybe it’s the carbonation
Loved watching the game on Sunday!  Jason was hilarious!! But we all have had that omg what the hell is my husband doing moment at one point in time 😂 but we were all here for it!!!
Did you just assume I’m a boy or girl
I enjoy listening to used to brothers you have a beautiful sense of humor and your family. Looks awesome Jason your kids. God bless them your daughters. Thank you. God bless.
Ok. Hear me out.   For charity- I would pay to see eyebrow trim/wax live for brothers. Bahahahaha
Jason is his own man. He’s a wealth of weird. You got to respect that.  Sincerely, from me, a guy who grew up near power lines. MERICA!
Need to add guests and talk about more then football...etc. ❤ Show!
We need Jason in Baltimore!
Jason and i order fast food the same way lol. Exact order for breakfast at Mcky Ds
What’s that thing a treasure map 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Cookie Pie!!!!  Im gonna get me one of those for my boys!!!!🎉😊
did you see the funko of Jason,?
🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Don't peak too soon...lol
Someone send Kelce the OLD SCHOOL STREAKING SCENE. " You think KFC is still open"
No hate from Buffalo
Im from Michigan and im calling it now lions fans will be singing on sunday i left my heart in san Francisco  "broken " btw
Jason is the absolute greatest!  Trav will be more popular again once he ditches the toy
Dude Patrick mahomes name should be Patrick the sniper mahomes I've been in Kansas City fan for 40 years and still never me to a damn football game been Iraq though good podcast guys
I watched the chiefs game on sunday night at 11.30 pm it started here in scotland,,when i saw jason ripping that shirt off for his brothers touchdown i thought this was the most awesome thing i ever witnessed in my 61yrs,,you also made that little girls day too an i want to say you guys are the absolute best,love you all you have a beautiful family..oh an im a swiftie lol..🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🥰🥰🥰👌👌👌🥰🥰🥰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well Jason better expect free McDonald’s after this😂😂
Kylie: “Jason we’re meeting Taylor today. Be on your best behavior.” Jason: “Take my shirt off? You got it!” Kylie: “Jason I said behave.” Jason: “Scream too? Well, if you insist.” 🤷‍♂️😂
Put your notes right in front of the camera Jason. Please. Have mercy with the side eye🤣🤣
I'm a hoarder...😊 My corners are full of my stuff I'm happy bout it😊
Jason is so broken…elbow doesn’t work, fingers don’t work, knee sprain…
Love you guys really enjoy but Travis maybe no F bombs I’m mean I know you can’t make everybody happy
I am ready for a Kelce Bros tailgate across the NFL. This needs to be a show.
I have been living to see you guys talk about this. Lol!
If you want to wake up McDonalds coffee will do it That was so sweet of Jason to do that for her, very kind nice to see
We need Kylie back on please. From one wife to another whose husband was supposed to be on his best behavior but exceeded  all of our expectations ❤ 😂 I need her info.
i’m a ravens fan and i’m excited to see them play travis and the chiefs next weekend! i’tll be my first playoffs game
Love these two !
Someone from Funko needs to send Travis the Jason Funko that’s circulating..
can we call you maauto?
I freakin love these gentlemen ❤❤ you have made me a football girl ❤️❤️ nice boobs Jason I love you Kylie❤️
W- awesome podcast!!!
You need to ask Devon Rodriguez to paint that photo. It will be epic.
McDonald's Coke is the best because they're the only ones that get the syrup in the proper metal containers.
How do I submit a question to no dumb questions my sister and I are Swifty’s and we don’t understand taking a knee and we didn’t understand why the Chiefs lost possession of the ball when it went out of bounds right at the touchdown line…???
Washington really missed the opportunity to make their mascot the Pigskins
Can you guys up your sizes i really want a shirt and hoodie but take a 4xl
Jason's laugh is so infectious.😂
Kelce 2024
Shout out Daniel for the pason happy POP😊
Snow out, Tits out line from Jason made me think of SNL Jeopardy.  When the category was Let It Snow and Sean Connery says Le Tits Now.   Gonna be Jason's new motto when it snows.
I love the retired tailgating idea!
broo Jason is me 💀
Damn it Travis, get the burnt ends...
Love this show!! Watch every week!!!
Love these guys ❤.
Couldn't stop laughing watching this😂😂😂😂
We must protect these two at all costs.
WHO DOESNT LIKE HASHBROWN PATTIES!!!!!!
It’s the fries, they’re the best!
The team needs heated Ski boot bags for your helmets
Is Jason using the McD’s app? If he’s getting two breakfast sandwiches they have a buy 1 get one free deal on the app
El Travadore!
Now with all the jabronis who have had McDeets meals, I definitely KNOW we deserve Kelce Family Meals.  One each for Trav, Jason, Kylie and Momma Kelce and Ed.
Jason is a legend.
First person since  1600's
Everyday...funny nake my day
WE NEED KYLIE'S POV!!!! GIVE US KYLIEEEEEEEEEEE LOL PRETTY PLEASE
SO TELL ME ABOUT BUFFALO!!??🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now that Jason is retired, can we get him to replace Romo as an announcer?!
RETIREMENT PLAN! Start a brewery and bring your beer to tailgates. Throw the best tailgate party. Live new heights episodes from tailgating
Am I the only one that gets the combo and puts the hash brown on my sausage egg and cheese?
LOL MCAUTO 😂😂 you both are great 👍
If Travis is the Big Yeti…. Jason must be the Big Stanley how the ladies go crazy for him. 😂
Tits the season! 🤣
Came here for Taylor, staying because of the Kelce fam. We don't even play football in South Africa😂
Great episode as usual!
Sorry for the rude people in the stands, every city and stadium have them. Best of luck to the Chiefs and the Kelce brother's. Thanks for hanging in the parking lot Jason with the Fans and partying totally down to earth gentlemen.
Kylie’s facial expression is by far my favorite thing about Jason going out the window ! Like I thought I left the kids back home but I guess not here we go again !!
McDonald's coke definitely hits different 🤣💜
Jason would make an excellent football  commentator.❤😊
Me in McDonald's: can i get the kelce breakfast 🥰🥰🥰🥰🤗
Going to every stadium to tailgate sounds like a great new post retirement docuseries idea for them. Each episode, tailgating with a different fan base and enjoying a game with the fans.
Making me laugh on a Wednesday 😁
Big fan of Jason’s dog lounging in the background 😂
Thanks to Jason and Kylie for winning the superb owl for the swifties. No need to keep playing sports ball. We already won the trophy. Excellent game Jason. Apparently Travis was also there, good job sportsman Travis.
Travis: did you see Jason shirtless up in the suite during your game… or can you not look up at the suite during your game?  😂😂😂😂😂😂
McDonald’s coke hits different. They have a deal with coke and get their syrup delivered in stainless steel tanks. Pretty sure they’re the only place that does that.
This is the Best pod cast ever, I love the camaraderie between you too.i was laughing the whole time. Just Halarious love it!!!
I got my Chiefs Kelce shirt at Etsy
GO CHIEFS! ALL OF YOU MAKE EACH OTHER GREAT ♡
Hey.... don't ya know, u can say call me whatever you want.....just don't call me late for supper 😅😅😅😅
Jason is 1000000% Bert K. twin... WE SOOOOO NEED THAT PODCAST TO HAPPEN - 4 BEARS 1 CAVE...
All that beer is showing on your belly Jason. I know 36 isn’t young in football, but it’s young in life. Get that under control now or you’ll be a fat man at 46. You are too cute to let that happen. ❤
Bear Paws made that beer can look like a mini lol
Where did Travis books go?
First show I've seen. They're so normal. It's refreshing.
What I would give to be an nfl offensive lineman, ur a high performance athlete and still get to eat ur fav fast food meals 😂😂
you should know that Jason at Mc Donalds is international news. Brazilian fans saw this too lol.
Marv leavy was the buffalo coach when Kelly was there
No hash browns? WTF?
McDonald's sales going up and up
*travis.....next weeks game take Malic acid, PQQ will give you lots of energy for the game....I want you to win for Taylor and advance into superbowl*
These two are carrying the American people right now
We’re going to need a McDonald’s sponsorship after this episode.
Travis go get ya a bag of Hot Luther's Jerky made in Iola, KS and wash it down with a Wild cherry Pepsi! It's tits bro!
At McDonalds   I either eat a hash brown or a Sausage and Cheese Biscuit With Grape Jelly (it's good with strawberry and apple jelly as well.  😂😂
Jason not eating hashbrowns is buns AF
I would love to hang out with these 2! Or I wish I was their sister... could u imagine a girl in this chaos?  It would be great
What does 92%ers mean?
*travis.....next weeks game take Malic acid, PQQ will give you lots of energy for the game....I want you to win for Taylor and advance into superbowl*
Surely some broadcasting company has to pick Jason up in retirement to do something 😂
I was blackout drunk! 1:01:14
Jason Kelce’s secret to avoiding armpit sweat stains…shirtless 😂
Lmfao Trav “ wtf is wrong with you” 😂
Most Excellent.
Jason belongs in Buffalo
Really appreciate the brothers speaking about the Lake Erie effect; having spent my childhood on the north side of that lake, I echo the sentiment that it is a special thing.  Wonderful podcast this week. Laughed and cried.  Always learning about the game.❤🇨🇦
Not a Bills fan, But thier fans do deserve a Super Bowel
❤️
Jason feels terrible ordering a large coke, yet he'll think nothing of drinking unknown alcohol from a bowling ball & countless beers. Lol.
These guys are so hilarious !!    they could talk about anything and we would love it !🥰
Travis cut out the caffeine.  Armpits trying to get rid of toxins.
jason understands that combos aren’t the one! just go ala carte— it’s less wasted food and i save $2-4 bucks every trip!
travis your hand looks like it was scratched by a cat
“Tay said she absolutely loved you” 🥹🥹🫶
The best thing that came out of the game was Jason in the box. I saw someone made a funko pop of Jason with his shirt off!
❤ my favorite podcast so far. Keep it up guys. Love y'all
Thanks!
Ala carte. Correct. Nice Jason.
Always "Uncle Travy"
OMG Rumplemitz is a strong ass drink. Its my T-5 drink. Because in 5 mins you are in a completely different place!!!
McDonald's has special carbonation/syrup mix that is ONLY THEIRS
My daughter and I love your podcast. She's 12 and now she's checking stats and watching football every weekend. Thanks for making it so fun for us.
I do agree McDonalds sausage egg and cheese is a great breakfast sandwich. Although, the sausage egg and cheese jalapeño chedder biscuit at Whataburger is the greatest breakfast sandwich of all time! Y'all should try it?
​love these guys! can't stand the eagles or the chiefs, but these guys rock it! F-Bomb all you want! Wish they would have addressed Jason holding the girl up to wave to taylor. That was pure awesome!
America's sweetheart Jason Kelce 💚
14:03 as long as you call me something nice I don’t care what you call me
This is part of the charm. Jason is hilarious.  Kelce for president!😂
McDonald's had better hook Jason up with a multi-million dollar add campaign.  It would be fire!
I am really hoping for a Lions vs Chiefs Superbowl! I love the Kelce brothers and I love my Lions. I would be rooting for the Lions but would be happy for KC so it's a win/win for a lot of people in that game.
What’s good BOYZ   LFG CHIEFS
Good luck, Travis and Chiefs!!!
Enough calories per dollar...LMFAO  Ya can tell these guys are Professional Athletes ❤❤❤
Travis uncontrollable laughter is therapy for me. 😂  "Tae said she absolutely loved you. " ❤
FYI that $5 code doesn't work
Cold Brew is the way to go!
Oh my, sausage, egg and cheese McMuffin is what I would order too....but I am a farm girl, make my own....Jason u r hot diggity dog, the man!
My dad always said when watching womens gymnastics, "Tha'ts not impressive! Show me a 5'10" big girl doing that and I'll be impressed!" LOL!
Travis' laugh gives me so much joy. 😂
kylie “don’t you dare” kelce
"You scared her"! LOL!!!!
Best episode ever!
Go Ravens !!!!!!
Favorite episode to date! Jason’s energy at the game was unmatched and we loved it!!
No Pepsi!! 😫
As a fellow big man jason's right fries are just empty calories and not enough calories per dollar as he mentioned. Gotta go with the burger and nuggs seperate
…he’ll need to work on words like ‘fastly’ tho.  But JC4Prez
Inquiring minds want to know, was that a regular size can of beer?
McDonald's should put Jason in a commercial...........seriously!
@newheightshow I already bought a tshirt featuring Jason’s epic shirtless beer roar!  Cincyshirts Made in Clifton tee 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Jason! You NEED the OIL POCKETS with your breakfast sandwich! 😂😂😂😂
As a Kelsea (my name spell) Jason and Trav are the brothers I never had!
LC’s > Joes every day. If you know you know!
The last name thing is so funny to me.  I worked with a guy and his uncle.  They had the same last name, but they pronounced it differently.
Mexican sodas are the best. They use cane sugar. New heights tailgate podcast lol
Can y'all askt McDonald's to bring back the Bacon/Steak Egg & Cheese bagels and the chicken snack wraps?  Seriously those were the best!  <--Chiefs fan for life (and swiftie).
Wait is big J a red head really?
JASON KELCE FOR PRESIDENT 🫶
Jason Kelce for Secretary of State!      Vote now !!!!!
Helmet taken off while on the field
4k more until 2 million
McDonald's coke is different.  McDonald's made a deal with Coke to get their syrup in stainless steel tanks 8nstead of plastic bags.  Makes a huge difference in taste.
I love you guys, love your show! Now I just need to buy some merch!
Your shirt removal was the highlight for me👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Travis taking all the heat off Hardman is just so awesome. He's also the guy that comforted Toney after his drops. Incredible leadership, and a great teammate.
I’ve been saying it since day one!!!  Jason Kelce for President!!!
Love how you chilled with the Mafia!
Our big family has this odd, long, ongoing for years contest called “Stallions.” It involves finding a shirtless person in a place where you normally don’t see shirtless people and taking a selfie. Then uploading to our Google album. I think Jason should check it out! #hengst
Jason seems SOOO much happier today—-must have been large coke & then lots of tailgating! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Chiefs Kingdom , this time we do it for Norma Hunt and Len Dawson  ❤ 😊🎉
The commanders is my FAVE team name and Jason’s least fave 😂😂
No one's throwing a full beer at a football game.. thats 9$
Sausage egg and cheese McMuffin Stan with Jason!
We’re going streaking!!!
59:20 love this guys 😂
Would absolutely love to see a video of Travis the first time he saw the pics & video of Jason in the suite with his shirt off 😂😂😂
i’ve been waiting for this episode since the game👏🏽😂 i’m so excited to watch!!💚💛❤️
The harmony on New News!
Everytime I hear LeBron stat I want to turn this off
Wild Cherry Pepsi...my man. 🤌👊
Love guys!!! Both amazing people!!
You just KNOW there will be McDonalds ad’s popping up next week talking about the “Kelce Combo”.
My McDonalds order: vanilla iced coffee, hash brown, egg biscuit. YUM!
Love when we get sightings of Jason’s dogs. We got a sleepy pup today just lounging on the couch!
This was funnest podcast. Thanks for all the laughs.
Lions fan should’ve known to stop drop and roll.  We learned that as a toddler🤷🏽‍♀️
From a Girl Scout mom... EAT OR FREEZE by Sept 30 (insert year purchased) is stamped on every box or case of cookies.
This was such a great episode. First time I have caught the live chat.
I fucking love cherry Pepsi my man#87
@10:02 I thought Travis was gonna segue to an Accelerator energy drink ad. "There's one thing better and that's an ice cold... Accelerator Active Energy. Alright now!"
DID I JUST HEAR A GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE REFERENCE
Best part of hump days for sure
The best fountain Coke is from McDonald’s. There is a kind of a documentary on it and what they do with their water and filtration system and the perfect mixture with their syrup. They’re the only restaurant that gets it right.
They should name it Kelce Breakfast on the menu
#nodumbquestions  How many national media outlets would write an article bashing eagles fans if they threw snowballs at players on the field for the last 2 weeks like bills fans did?
Loved this episode yall are the best honestly made my day
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chiefs-Bills was a hell of a game! As a Chiefs fan, gotta give the Bills props for going as hard as they did with all their injuries. That's real, right there.
Classic episode.  I hope Jason’s going to Baltimore this week!!!
Teenie weenie beanie https://youtu.be/9r5XVdKKcas?feature=shared
Well done, always entertaining!
Put that portrait behind you for the podcast
Is that a dog on the couch behind Jason?
Jason should go into part time wrestling is he retires from the NFL.  He could be the next Arn Anderson.
First time here..life long washington fan..first five minutes I here no question were the worst team?..Hearin that at first is like bein smackin when your already down..Still love u guys though..Thanks for the smack 😂
Bottlegate, also referred to as The Beer Bottle Game, was an officiating controversy that resulted in a fan riot during an American football game in the 2001 season of the National Football League (NFL) between the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars and the Cleveland Browns.
Absolutely hilarious episode! I have been waiting for this one since Sunday and I saw the big man himself just having the time of his life. Was laughing so hard in the car listening to you guys that other drivers were definitely concerned. You two are absolute beauts!!
Travis, change your shirt we'll wait!!!! LOL!!! 😝
I've been to several games and they have cups or cans and they keep the can lids.  They told me the reason they kept the lid was a safety issues.  I understand it now.
Jason’s crinkly eyed smile gets me every single time 🫶
Trav let the chiefs staff have your promo stuff that comes in. 🤣
Hello from NW Ohio! This is the only podcast I watch. I look forward to Wednesdays to laugh with you  😂.  Watched this weeks game twice and enjoyed Jason's antics. What Jason did for those young Taylor Swift fans at the game was amazing. 👏👏👏👏👏
I was hyped after this game I could not fall asleep!!! Such a great game! Love our boys showing nothing but respect to the Bills and even their fans even when their fans started throwing stuff at our players.
Great podcast guys!! I laughed so hard!! Best in entertainment!!!!
Travis, DM Caitlyn Snelling. She's a FANTASTIC Chiefs artist.
I hope you didn’t throw the Big Meats Box away!
I swear Jason and my husband were separated at birth... I feel ya Kylie 😂❤
I'm with Jason on screw the combo, just give me 2 breakfast sandwiches
Lions were in FG territory and wouldve made it a two score game
Trav sweats out a T shirt and puts on a hoodie 😂
DETROIT!!!! 🦁
Treasures! 🫶🍺
I loved when he helped the little swifty show off her sign❤
The wrong brother moves on again.
The only time I laugh throughout the week is during this podcast.❤
Did Travis bring Travis another shirt?😂
W
Hash browns all the way !
These brothers are the best thing happened to earth in Earth's history 😂❤❤❤  Love you Jason and Trav ❤️  And please bring Taylor for one of the episodes
My 9 year old daughter has seen like 2 clips of your podcast and already can spot "Jason's dog bowls" at Target. lol. you guys are changing lives! Love to see you both so happy.
Not the small things comment
All these 49er “fans” are bashing Purdy yet they don’t remember it’s the kid's second year and he’s only gonna get better. He’s outstanding #BrockPurdy
Coke from bottle is superior!
Professional athletes who can speak English? WTF? I need time to process this...
We’re the city of Good Neighbors! We love you, Jason. 💙❤️🦬
Great episode.  I am a little shocked this was the first time you met Taylor but I can only imagine how busy everyone's schedules have been and I'm just glad it looked like everyone had a great time and such a positive outcome for Travy :D
43:00
Loved your first impression… you are AWESOME!!❤❤❤❤
The coach was Marv Levy.
This is such a highlight to Wednesday mornings!!! 🙌🥰
Biggest Yeti for president.
Good luck Sunday Chiefs, go get those Ravens!
Jason you were awesome part of the weekend! Thanks for being you! Bud Light needs to sponsor lol Sweet helping little girl and signing Danielle's jersey! orig Coke def best pop! glad Trav had a great game the box sure looked like a good time!
Haters wanting ravens to win so they don't have to see Taylor.  Travis, Taylor, Jason and all their supporters can still get a suite and all of them show up and show out. And they will be shown even more 😂😂
Jason will be back next year unless I hear the words. I AM RETIRING from his mouth
Hearing Jason go through the Pro Bowl events and how a different injury is preventing from competing in every event is the reality of football. These guys aren’t coming out of this the same, and 10 years later they won’t sound the same
I thought Jason announced yesterday he had signed for another year. Is that not right?
Totally cat scratches on his hand 😂 i think thats what detective jason was trying to imply
I know i’m not the only one who thinks this, but how amazing would it be to be able have a few beers and talk with these guys! They are without a doubt amazing athletes but always come across as some of the most down to earth guys
You guys are awesome! I’m a die hard Bills fan, but can enjoy and respect all football players and teams. Sorry some fans disrespected you all, but is not the majority.
WILD CHERRY PEPSI!!!! 🍒 ❤ IT'S THE FUCKING BEST!
I ship travis and taylor
Probably the best podcast this year!!!!! I never laughed so loud then I did today!! Thank you both for all the belly laughs!! 😂😂 Love you both… keep doing what you are doing!!!! ❤
I still cant find how to vote for the bracket...I'm a jabronie lol...can someone help me pls
Bills fan here. Tough loss but thanks for the shout out Jason!
Is Jason and Kylie going to the Baltimore game?
I laughed so hard the second half of this.
Never the McMuffin Jason it’s always the McGriddle
Thank you for a great core workout this morning…purely from laughing SO hard. 👏🤣
Could you please quit using “fucking” in your commentary. It takes away from your content so much.
Yo…that intro anthem SLAPS!
The Jason Kelce charm! ❤
I have to say, these 2 are my favorite brothers.  The Kelce bros tailgate tour would be amazing.  Make it happen.
WE DONT GIVE A PISS ABOUT THE BILLS!
Wild cherry Pepsi is so underrated!!
W
amazing as always 👏🏾
Wow, I missed the recap of the Kansas City game! All I heard was Jason’s experience at the game. Booo.
Bills Mafia loves Jason Kelce ❤️💙
As a Michigander I’m disappointed in that lion fans intellect 😂
W
Got a feeling before Jason retirement he gonna play with his brother 😂😂😂😂😂
w
The officials overturned a call after the next play was run with under 1:00 left in the game. I was there.
Goooooo Chiefs!!!!!!!! ❤💛
Fantastic episode Travis & Jason 😂🙌
Only a TE would ask if someone can throw the ball lefty after they say they hurt their right…. Ala George Kittle to Brock
Damn didn’t plug the accelerator active energy after hyping up the best possible drink, then ruined any chance at combos pizza snack sponsorship
Awwrightnah! See yahhhh! ❤
It matches Taylor from Anti-Hero….
Jason for president 2024
Shirtless jason made the chiefs display at union station in kc!
I love this!!
#nodumbquestion What are yall doing in the offseason?
IF Jason retires, we need to have a show of him going and partying at every stadiums tailgate
The Kelce boys need to do merch on the family reactions: Mama, Kylie and Kids , Papa-
That beer can looks like one of those mini cans in his giant paw. Kelce legend.
Maybe Travis' hand injury was from a Taylor cat attack! Cat's can get feisty when they are playing.
Jasons dog is living his best life behind him on the couch snoozing away
I know Jason is contemplating retiring.....but if he wants to make another run, i wouldnt be opposed to him coming over to the Niners. Lol We could use him.
I’m with Jason on the combo subject. I’m just not feeling the drink.
We get cherry coke at the movies too!
@nfl please put the Kelce brothers in charge of the pro bowl
Jason how can you make a can of Labatt Blue look like a Dixie cup!?
The amount of joy this show brings. Adding some magic back into the sport and life!
The Kelce Charm😂
I think all those years of Law & Order have went to Jason’s head cause he’s investigating that hand injury/cleat imprint like a professional
Trav didn't cleated.....those are cat scratches!!
Travis looked like Ernie on Sesame Street 😅
What do I love most- this podcast, Jason being Jason/giving no Fs, Travis teasing Jason, Kylie just causally being the queen by dealing with both of these guys or the entire Kelce family?! 😍😍😍
No bottles at stadiums. No cans either i dont think l. All i ever see are cups. All Draft beer.
Trav you have terrible blocking madden says so lol
Lots of people I’ve seen talk about Joe  Brr is overrated.  Well he was out for the entire season basically with and injury.    Very random with that I just wanted to put it out there don’t know why
best on the edge of my seat game in a long time.  love how real you guys are and funny as hell!!! 🙂
God bless you 🙏  both brothers
New series where Jason Kelce experiences a tailgate from every NFL team!!!!!
1/2 slab and a couple of zman's....holy cow that's a big boy meal
McDonald’s spokesmen!
Thank you so much for being such respectful dudes.  I'm sorry some of the Mafia was less than kind to you, but they don't represent us all!  I love to hear you guys praising the Bills for their effort instead of just talking smack.  Much love always ❤
Jason was blessed with 3 girls ❤because he is amazing and such  girl daddy and a teddy bear ❤...travis will have a girl and a boy ..my witchy feeling never fails.me 😂❤❤love you guys
So what I'm hearing is Jason might join the Bills and come out of retirement? 😉
I love me some BIG guys!!
Take a shot for every time they say ELECTRIC 😂
New heights series of which stadium does the best tailgating would be amazing!
No dumb questions, where is the baby Swiftie 😍
Travis, you had me at Mcdonald’s hashbrown & lost me at cherry Pepsi
Marv Levy was the coach of the Big Tree Inn Bills w/ Jim Kelly
I love you guys, but my loyalty is with my husband and his Ravens this weekend.  LOL
I am an artist I can do the painting
I wanted to hear about when he picked the girl up and showed Taylor her sign
I absolutely love football now .
We want Kylie
Jason is so wrong about combos
It’s not just fountain coke… McDonalds coke is on another level. Crack a Cola
Is there any other type of coffee other than hot or iced lol
I think this was when the y had the replacement ref s
Snow outs. Kids outs. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2/24 way to go on your 2 touchdowns Travis rocks you two are the best
Jason, we gotta talk about it...
I would tailgate!
Jason! You need to come in the early season to experience Pinto Ron and his ketchup and mustard ceremony. ❤️❤️❤️
God !!! Uses too are the funniest mother fuckers lmfao fucking greattt 😂
Yes the  Cherry Pepsi!
So electric!
Travis gargle laughing is such a vibe and fkn hilarious! Like I have tears laughing at him laughing 😂
McDonald's has the BEST Coke, and the Sprite is super crispy! Everywhere else absolutely PALES in comparison!  Also, Joe's BBQ in KC is one of my 3 go-to BBQ places! The other two are Rosedale BBQ and Wyandot BBQ!
"Calories per dollar" this guy is speaking my language. This is why I never buy low-fat cheese, peanut butter, anything. Whole milk. Let's go.
Hi-C Orange
1 year together Jason, Travis, and Reid??
oh my this was the best podcast!! I laughed so hard!
If Jason does retire, he should go travel to all the different football games and rate their tailgates!
Great show, both happy today 🙌🏼
Need to get Travis involved in talking; Jason’s training is showing up.
Unless you are the Saints playing dirty birds
I’d do anything to have both brothers play just one year in Cleveland. Just one time. Before they both drive off in the sunset.
Yinz have to tailgate in Pittsburgh… that’s a whole experience!!!
I wanna hear about the little swiftie 🥺😍
No Dumb Question, why do some players where the tape on the back of their arms?
Kelces bring the FUN 🦏✨Kylie Kelce is a 💎   Go to an NFL game 🇺🇸 It’s uniquely local 🍻 🎉 Dress up, pick your favorite player and enjoy the ride
I see your disrespect and I raise you a win! Classy 🫶🏻
Jason definitely didn't have a hydration problem in Buffalo.
LOVE these boys!! Jason was the best cheerleader for Travis. 🎉
I’m a Ravens fan so hoping for a chiefs L this weekend but love you guys ❤
Why do my cheeks hurt 😁
What if you got to pee during the game?!?
My pits just start leakin’
Do you think the Ravens have a bigger chance to win since Lamar Jackson is having a good year and the Ravens Defense is #1 right now
Can we get a stealthy Travis shirt?!
LFG !
My names Josh Watson from Arkansas it's my birthday today pls give me a shout-out GO CHIEFS!!
I love double quarter pounder but most people like Big Mac which do you guys prefer
The playoffs have been so exciting. Not a boring game in the bunch!
🎉🎉 Jason in Buffalo was all we never knew we needed 🎉🎉
So Travis is sweating so badly that he has to change his tshirt and comes back with a hoodie. Wtf 😳.
Didn't bottle gate happen in Cleveland because of officiating... But the real underlying issue was that the city knew Modell was going to sell the team so they were pissed and the officiating just was the straw break8ng the Camels back... No?🤔🤔🤔
Buffalo › Philadelphia
Jason: So you don’t like the camera always on Taylor in the Chiefs’ box? Let me see what I can do!” 😅😂
I would love to see a show where Jason is just going to tailgates and reviewing them.
"Snows out, tits out!" LOL omg 🤣Jason is the best, C'mon now. I'll have to remember that if it ever snows here in Sydney Australia. Suns out guns out is more our speed around here.
Take a shot every time Travis says "electric"
Love the Taylor Swift and her Swifties! You always bring positive energy Ms. Swift! Love the Kelce boy’s podcast!!!
Bills mafia 👍
I’m from Australia I fucking love u both go new heights
I'm a Redskins fan. Not Commanders.
Bills fan for life 💙❤ & still really enjoy your podcast insight, it's fun to listen to! Thanks for the kind words! Welcome to #themafia Jason, we'll see ya again! Competition is football, Trav, you fuel our fire, so thanks & Buffalo will see ya next season!
Traffic, traffic lookin' fo my Chapstick, feelin' kinda carsick, there's a Ford Maverick.  Aint no way he said Malibu's Most Wanted. That took me out! 😂😂😂
Im an Ohio girl and I definitely think we need you guys to come home and play for the browns!!!! ❤️
Best part of that shirtless moment , was how hard momma Kelce was  laughing.  Glad you felt welcome  in Buffalo.   Our area is the best place. Was good to see how much normal fun you and Taylor were able to experience with your family.
As much as I wanted Buffalo Bills to Win!! I do appreciate a good Shirtless Jason Celebrating his beautiful Brother Win again!! And also that little girl got to meet Taylor at her first NFL game!! So sweet!! You two have electric energy and it’s truly inspiring! Go Bills ( next year)… Hope you two continue to do amazing things for this community Jason and Travis woot woot!!  I wish I could afford a Super Bowl ticket! Rooting for you all!
Travis beard looks fire longer
Jason Kelce next stop, Arrowhead!
Best podcast around. You both are such great ambassadors for football and humanity. ❤
Guy Attitude adjust him into table
Kelce for president 🎉 Hes the absolute best 😂
Great show guys, Congrat to Travis on 2 TD day. Jason you were way over the Top at game. You guys have made this life time Bears fan a big of your show. Go Chiefs win it all.
Tell me you’re from Northeast Ohio without telling me you’re from Northeast Ohio?  Jason: “pop”  Thank you sir.
Jason need to run through the fans with a headset on to give a perfect fan experience
this is better than snl 😁
Have you guys watched the anti-hero video by one Taylor Allison Swift? Compare it to Travis’ pregame outfit if you will.
I cracked up 😂. If these two don’t get a tv deal, there’s something wrong.
You two are the best. I could watch you 2 all day. So funny and down to earth.
This show is good for my blood pressure 😂😂 Thank you for the hilarious video!! You guys are the GREATEST!!
47 plays 4 kneel downs
Any other wives out there immediately thinking about how horrified you'd be if . . . 😂 😂 😂
I love that Jason had such a great time 😍 he deserves it
I am new to football so I don’t really understand all of what they are talking about, but I still find it interesting. This is live I think. So hilarious that Jason was shirtless at the game
Jason living his best life! Love to see it. Big fan of you guys. Sad day for the Bills fans but you guys made the loss a little bit easier ❤
I love love this show damn
I don't do combo meals...😂this information is the minutiae I love❤
Epic Ep75, 147k viewing live!! Phewwww, just got my breath back after the Jason’s ‘experiences’ at Buffalo 😂😂
Come to Williamsport Pennsylvania for the Little League World Series I’m inviting you like I’m somebody special
Farmer’s Dog Food , that’s right feed your 4 legged family member the best.🐕‍🦺
There would have been more brackets submitted if it had been easier to find! I had to go on Reddit to figure it out 😂
Nothing about little Ella and Jason?  I can’t be the only one to want to hear about it.
Come to a Detroit tailgate there is none like it
Steeler fan here but love these guys.  Wish them all the best.
Love the Kelce brothers!! 🫶🏼
Absolutely love you guys, awesome brothers ❤️  You really know how to make people feel happy! Thanks to your parents for raising amazing  guys!
Sunday was tough. I was never so conflicted in my life. I'm a Bills fan first but I also like the Chiefs, I'm a New Heights fan, a Swiftie, and I just love proud girl-dads!
Omg.  Talk about Taylor.  She’s a big part of the game … like it not
Pleaseeeeeee the Ravens dominated Houston
❤
When you bring your girl on here trav  😂
Sh** I’m a dude and I debated my brother all week about how good looking Travis is😂😂😂
Pepsi is better than Coke but Cherry Coke is a million times better than Cherry Pepsi
Was that Justin Nunley in that pic from the Bills game??!
Jason Kelce shirtless solidifies that I do in fact have a type. 😂
Great fun Jason
Sausage egg mc muff for sure!!!
Best part he lifted up the girls to see taylor
They were too nice towards the bills fans. They were so awful. Even threatening their own Kicker. Im glad they lost
Word is that Kylie asked Pat Mahomes, Sr. to convey her message, “Get you a- -  back inside”. True??
Everyone was lovin it when you jumped out except the security …. He’s on record saying “ this is insane!”  And definitely was NOT happy
I just can't with them. Greatest thing ever 😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂
Just heard of this podcast after watching Jason Kelce shenanigans. Glad I did. Love these guys.
mcdonald's steak egg and cheese bagel will change your life. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Welcome to Buffalo Travis! The wind is crazy along with the weather here.
Multi-millionaire Jason is worried about getting his money's worth at McDonalds. "Not enough calories per dollar" 😂
Talking about dogs.. and you know Kylie wants a pet .
My boyfriend and I are huge fans. We have a eagles and chiefs jerseys!!!! We love how funny you guys are. Can't wait to spend a week in Philadelphia this summer.
Will Jason be traveling down to Baltimore this coming weekend
Kylie : Jason behave we are meeting Taylor   Jason: kylie I’m going to take my top of and jump out the suite    😂😂😂😂
"Snows out tits out" is my new favorite statement.
We have to hear Kyle's "calling" whistle!! 😂😂
McDonald's has the best coffee. Their caramel mochas 🤤🤤 i buy the mccafe breakfast blend for my home also. Way better than SB or Dunkin.
There is a cardboard cutout of Jason at Union Station in KCMO.
I instantly thought of Old School. Jason is the best 😂😂
How do they not talk about him holding up the little swiftie
Travis for you to take responsibility when you didn’t have to say anything 🥹 Love you guys
Not the Jason Kelce charm😂😂😂 I absolutely love this 😀 😍 ✊🏽💯😄😄
I could watch them allllll dayyyy yall crack me up 😅😊
Jason said “got the Buttahs on” he a Philly native fr, but stop choking them jawns up like u in the military 😂
It is a happy trail. LOL
You can see a Dermatologist doctor they can do treatments to reduce the sweating. To cut it down. It can be an excessive issue.  It can be an issue.
Bills fans are only second to being the biggest degenerates to Philly fans.
Watching from my post in Belmopan, Belize ❤ Really making me crave some McDonalds Breakfast, Jason 🥹🥹
LAKE EFFECT! 1:08:34
I was so looking forward to this episode and getting the brothers take on this game. It did not disappoint!
Two best America sons ❤
Travis see if you could get the little girl to actually meet Taylor
No thermostat after 30 muller lites. Haha. So glad you had fun.
Bottle gate, there was a pass that was incomplete but called complete the refs up above try to call it for review but it was missed by the refs on the field. Then the browns run another play. And when the refs realized they missed the booth reviewing the previous play they changed it to a incomplete pass even though another play was already run. Witch is against the rules
Freakin hilarious!! I swear Jason reminds me of my husband. They seriously are the same damn person.
Travis laugh is EPIC 😂😂!! Best episode!!!! 💪🏈
There are so many Jason memes out there already!
There are already shirtless Jason tshirts all over!! Must get me one!
Run for president Jason...you can reunite the country!
Is it me or is Jason’s dog in the back thee most chilled dogI have ever seen he laying on the couch chilling😂
Jason is going to be handed a coke everywhere he goes now.
Kelce Bros Tailgate Tour is a reality tv show that must be made! Burnett!
Travis Kelce’s laugh is one of the best sounds 😂❤
Omg these guys are crazy fun! ❤
Holding up that little girl was the best Jason
New Heights new shirt idea. Picture of shirtless Jason with the saying Snow's Out Tuesday Out. They would sell out.
My son who has Austim is a huge fan of you Travis he loves you
My gut hurts from laughing!!🤣🤣🤣🎉🎉🎉

Y’all are the best!! I get so much enjoyment from watching you both.
Sounds like Kylie is getting her cat.
You guys make folks want to watch football. 🤘
Good on boys 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Blue collar (and Great Lakes) teams have the best fans!!  (Detroit, Cleveland, Philly, Buffalo, Pittsburgh!)
SEXY BATMAN 2024
You boys are naughty😂😂😂😂
oh God I laughed when they were talking about making the first impression, etc....and Travis is giggling so hard......brothers for sure
No kidding
It's a amazing what a little Rest & Relaxation can do. Jason looks well rested and  happy!
Why not talking about lil Ella who ended up on the Today show thanks to Jason's kindness and thoughtfulness
Damn, I just want to go drink with Jay.
Kylie is an amazing partner to Jason. She watches out for him!
Will you be making the trip to Baltimore??
❤
Painting of Daddy’s boobs are showing🤗🤣🤣🤣
Mr. Pfizer !
Kylie: We're meeting Taylor today, don't embarrass me.  Jason: I got this. **rips off shirt** Kylie: ...
Shout out to Zack Collaros (CFL champion QB and former roommate of the Kelce's) in the booth with Jason Kelce!

Jason : “I was blacked out drunk when Kylie met me” 😂
Split that hash brown in half and put half on each SEnC. Game changer 😁😁
Travis doing this whole episode with T Rex arms, tho 😂😂
Bills Mafia sounds amazing! ❤
I need some merch with Jason!  It's a need!!need!!! 😂😂❤
Lol😂
Jason = Matusak from North Dallas Forty!!!
My ladies man impression is on point 😂
Animal House, John Belushi when the Germans bomber Pearl Harbor 😂😂😂  Loving Life…don’t be embarrassed. My first thought was Jason needs a little break after his season.
Trav, YOU LOST ME ON PEPSI, NFW
Jason get into the pres race quick..we need you 😅
Shirtless Jason made "Travis moment" a "Jason moment" but in a good way...😂😂😂
Chiefs RB room has awesome energy! Love our trio of Jet, Pop, and CEH. Really miss seeing Jet out here in the playoffs. Hope he’s healing well.
Jason is hilarious 😂
Travis do the pairing of Jason, and copies for everyone that can buy it!!! I would love it for a t-shirt toooooo🦾💯🇺🇸👍

Going to miss you guys during off season.. have fun.. stay safe…and make those family memories…😢
I’m legit cackling 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tailgating with the Bills Mafia is amazing!!  No other place can compete  with tailgating in Buffalo.
I'm sure Taylor has been watching the podcast and getting an idea about who Jason is. She totally knows he's awesome
What about the little girl with the sign??? That was adorable!!💙 True dad move!!
😂😂😂that's the wrong thing to tell America and new topic😂😂😂
I’ve said it before we the people do not deserve Jason Kelce glad he is a Eagle
What uniforms are going to be worn by the chiefs game at Baltimore
I like the Accelerator drinks but it pisses me off QT only carries 5-6 flavors while carrying every monster or red bull ever thought of.
Jason Kelce charm…omg these guys are the best!
Get the hash brown and put it in the sausage egg and cheese.
Negative ghost ryders, Glass bottle cold coke is the best in the world!!!!
Travis: I gotta change shirts  *proceeds to put a sweatshirt on*  🤣🤣💀 Outta sight outta mind!
This is great 😂😂
Old School!!! Great movie lol 🤣
McDonalds needs to do a Jason Kelce meal.
Tay said she absolutely loved you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂
Travis I just wanna say that I love you brother but as a ravens fan you guys are going down on Sunday no hard feelings lol
they win the world
Jason got the Taylor stamp of approval!!!!!! It's all happening!!
Travis’s laugh is killing me 😂
Jason’s laugh always makes me laugh 😂👌🏼 it’s great hahah
Travis’ laugh is gold!!
You guys crack me up! Love you like I personally know you both. LOL
"Picturesque" 😂
get his nipples cold...so Ellie can say dad's nipples are on tv
@angelsantiago7812 0 seconds ago Jason I hope you get a job in the nfl booth after retirement!! The NFL needs you on a weekly basis!!!! Take over for collinsworth
I’m like Jason, never the combo meal always just a drink & the main part of the meal.  Never fries or hashbrowns.
Real missed opportunity for Travis to take his sweaty shirt off and scream with an accelerator in hand.
It’s great to see a famous person let loose and have fun.
Move over Mayor McCheese! Jason for Mayor of McDonaldland!
Great now I’m starving and all I want is McDonald’s breakfast and a giant cherry Pepsi 😩
Jason for POTUS!!!
And CONGRATULATIONS TRAVIS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME GAME!!!
Jason's hard nipples! How do I get that mental picture out of my mind 😱
the fact Jason wore a shirt to this podcast is quite disappointing
Jason, PLEASE run for president! 🇺🇸
The nipple ripple affect 🤣
Love that it's Kylie who can reel Jason in
Jason Kelce is a national treasure.
I mean Jason Kelce for President sounds good 😂😂
You guys are amazing, best podcast out there!
Josh Allen get Bill's to sign Jason Kelce next year Superbowl 2025!! Love you guys!!!
Yeah the beard need to shave off.
I’d vote for Jason!!!!!!!
Omg LOVE YOU JASON, Out the Window, then making those little girls Feel SPECIAL You are ABSOLUTELYSOOOO MUCH FUN!!😊😊😊😂😂😂
Jason,  did you hear the Bill's fan yell "hey Jason come & play for us"!
Ok who wants to bet which pop company will just on them with a endorsement deal first after this interview lolol coke or Pepsi
Jason Kelce for president!!!!
Good job with the harmony on New News!!
I really hope he doesn't retire
That could be a good show, Jason just travels to the country tailgating on game day. See how all the fans do it up.
This is how my mind works after 40 ML😂😂😂
Love them so much! Best brothers ever!❤
New News Jason out of the box😂😂😂😂❤
We all know you had lots of fun!!! 😂😂 Great way to celebrate your bro 👏🏽 ✊🏽🎊🎊
She smiled…….in the background like a proud wife was Kylies reaction to the touchdown and Jason kelce being shirtless!!!
Jason deserves the fun day out
Packers tailgates are top tier. Check it out down the road when y'all retire. Lambeau is a fun time.
We love you Travis! Not all of us Bills Mafia are disrespectful.
Epic moment Jason! 🙌🏼❤️
Just don’t call you late to dinner
OMG!! Did Jason major in English Literature @ college/university!! His turn of phrase is unmatched!!
“I gotta have my shirt off”!!!!!!! Jason ❤
Jason being a part of the pageantry 😂😂😂 ❤❤❤
You guys are the best part of Wednesday mornings! Thanks for making so many of us smile! :)
After Jason retires (whenever in the future) I’d love a Jason Kelce stadium tour where he tried to hit up a game at each stadium and immerses himself into all the fan culture and parties it up across the country.
Why were the Chiefs giving the bird to fans do you think that’s professional. It was not. I think it’s an old stadium the cold water wasn’t intentional. Why thy are building a new one. It’s 50 years old. Did you guys see the Bert and Ernie comparisons on that suit. It was an intense game. What did you think of Bills offense verse defense. Young team.
If Travis wins the super bowl, you two must promise to take of your shirts again!!
8 years ago I came to States and for the love of God I couldn’t not understand Superbowl. My husband with “boxes”, superbowl parties always held in our house, all men go crazy, not to mention footer sandwiches that don’t fit perfectly for a bite. Well our 8yr Swiftie daughter changed everything. Now we bother him to explain us faults and all judges decisions. He will never watch Sunday football in peace. Girls took over the party in our house 😅 Jason you looked like Obelix at that window. You just needed Viking helmet and braids.
The disrespect… doing a BWW commercial when all the Bills fans are watching :/
The Kelce Tailgates across America tour.  You go even to your enemies territory. Denver for TrAv, and Dallas For Jason
“Nickel” beer night in the Cleveland Stadium… fun time’s 😂
That would be a great show, kelce's do the tailgates in every state
😂❤
Tailgating stadiums is a great thing to do for the podcast
Kelce Bros Tailgating would be a must watch, hello TV producers?
H-1 M&T Bank Jason!!! Come visit us on Sunday!!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I waited so long for this episode!
I would watch you guys Tailgate all over the country anytime. Lock that idea in now!
Taylor should have gone shirtless too-that could have been fun.
😅😂😂😅
Sensational 👏podcast I love it the Kelce Brothers are awesome and funny 2
Stadium Tailgating with the Kelces!! That's the greatest reality show ever!!+
Jason you were absolutely awesome… you made the show.. love how you get involved with your fans ❤❤
Jason you made that game!!! Soooooooooooo enjoyable!!!!!!
an NFL tailgate tour YouTube series would be GOLD....Printing MONEY SON !!!
Definitely need a New Heights series of tailgating each individual fan base for sure when you guys are done playing 😂
This is the good part of America 🇺🇸!! God Bless Y'ALL!! ❤️ from 🇨🇦!!
Once again, Jason proves he's just a great dude.
Tailgate show with the Kelce's would be insane
KELECE TAILGATE TOUR!!!
😂
The ads are ridiculous. You guys do not use Etsy 😂 let’s stick with believable ads.
I am absolutely not ever jumping on a table on fire!! That’s insane…
So excited for Baltimore this week!
Off season goal #1, more Chris Jones on the show.  That episode with him was by far one or your funniest, and the guy seems to have great stories.
Those Bills fans wouldn't waste beer putting out that fire!!!
An entertainment network needs to sign Jason to a deal where he travels around the country to hang out at different tailgates, learn the history of their traditions, and rate the experience! Man v. Football Stadiums!
❤❤❤
On the wrong side of the lake!
Jason, “ Stop, Drop’n roll son “ 😂
😂😂😂 #New #News
Cherry Pepsi is good but not even close to Coke man. Get out Trav
I think you can take that one again, “there’s only one thing better, that’s an ice cold accelerator”.
Lmao
Love you boys
Take it off Jason
Travis calling it Oklahoma Joe's and grabbing a z-man and fries shows he's a real KC bro 🍻
anyone remember Pepsi Clear? Gosh I loved that stuff in middle school.
Congrats on a HOF career
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Defense in Baltimore!!!
Wow Trav..gotta change that t-shirt 😂😂
Weird Food History did a whole video on why McDonald's cokes taste different https://youtu.be/GA_OYUHYYMA?si=KQmCX0c3f2z_7gr9
Lucky it wasn't rohypnol in that bowling ball. Gotta aak, bro ...
121K watching right now! 🎉 I love it! 🙌🙌
Was really hoping he’d go through a table 😂
Thank you for entertaining us Jason. The best thing is that you had such a great time and everyone around you. It may have been the best thing about this event. Also the win and Travis’ performance. 😍
Ohhh,How did Jason jump back into the suite? Epic!!
Good for you Jason.! Good way to take a mental health break. Partied hearty with the Bills’ Mafia.
Now i have to drive to Mc Donalds 🫣
Wow what it would be like to hang with you two. Hilarious. ❤
The shot for the bowling ball is, Wisniowka. It’s a Polish brandy
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow they are getting more sponsors. Etsy?! Wow! Didn’t see that one happening.  Travis and Jason attending tailgates in retirement sounds fun.
My dad was at Nickel Beer Night.  lol.  You should hear the story.
Travis's sweater isn't giving Wes Anderson or Cheesecake Factory. It's giving Kyra's Eras Tour surprise song blanket
Bottlegate was because the refs went back to review a play after another play had already been ran, which is obviously not allowed. They were in the playoff hunt and this caused them to basically be out of the hunt.
Trav for the win with the fit change - mid show LOL
The day Taylor makes an appearance is the day I stop watching 🤓
I love how he was just having fun 😂😂😂😂
but we wouldn't throw a full can of beer; that would be wasteful;
I feel like Philly did bad because they had amazing Vets but their lower level players didn’t buy in as much. Played individually
Jason is on brand with just HOW Kylie commented on Travis and his mustache: “if they’d swipe right at your worst, they’ll love you at your best”— just as when Jason did blacked out when he first met Kylie! I FREAKIN’ LOVE THEM ALL.
The NFL needs to get rid of that dumbass call about fumbling into the endzone!
Travis said the thing😂😂😂😂🎉🎉
No one hatin’ on Jason 💯💯💯
Pitts, Are you kidding me? Now I know why I love this show, Oh no, now it’s Jason’s turn🤣🤣Jungle Jason….Love it!!!
❤Jason
I’m here for post-season Jason Kelce pre-gaming and living his best life at the Bills/Chiefs game. 😂 we love seeing a mom and dad night out with him and Kylie! ❤  And then Jason saying she got caught up in the Bills Mafia magic and explaining how much fun he had🤣 he was truly loving life.
Get the SEC McMuffin with the hashbrown, and put the hashbrown in the McMuffin! It’s a cheat code.
We need a shirt with Jasons shirtless roar out of the box lol. Just sayin
My question is, why is it called LeBron stats? He's basketball?
Jason is a whole vibe!!!!  And we are all there for it.....❤❤❤❤
You both have the biggest hearts love you both
I got the BEST CHIEFS Christmas tree topper on Etsy!!
Q: What do you call it when the game-winning touchdown becomes a turnover, then ends with a shanked field goal? A: “🎶 A guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.🎶”
Jason!!!
Trav talking up Bills Mafia after all the shit they talked ahows what a classy dude he is. And taking the blame for Mecole's fumble ... greatest teammate ever!!
Chiefs fan at the game, I’ve never been told to go f myself more in my life. Heading to the truck after the game one dude said, “ hey you, politely go F YOURSELF” loool, to which I respond, “ see you buddy, NEVER AT THE SUPERBOWL, have a good night “ 😘
🎉🎉
❤
My grandma use to sit in the dog pound and throw dog bones at people lmao RIP Nana
I wish Jason would look more into the camera when he is speaking.
Will they say Taylor name ??
You both are simply the best!
10 cents beer night ?
Watching from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ‘Mon the Chiefs!🎉❤
Just the two of them talking about mundane shit like Jason's McDonalds ordering regimen is fire, lol
Living and loving your Wednesday podcast drops!
There were many snowball-gates in the mid-late 1980's at Municipal Stadium out of the Dawg Pound. I think Jason is confusing the Nickle Beer Night story with an Indians promo in the early 1970's.
A big SHUTOUT from Taiwan
Pop!! 🇨🇦  🫶 NOTHING like fountain pop, sneaky good.
​Hey Kelce Bros...give show out to Girls Flag Team that's repping CHIEFS at nationals in ORLANDO!!!! NS ELITE VIPERS!!!!
Cutie patootie Brandon!!
BEST....DUO.....EVER!!
Fellas, I did sound on the sidelines for years with Cowboys Radio.  The worst place for people throwing things out of the stands was in AZ and throwing frozen Water Bottles.  Second was the possibility of Raider fans in Oakland throwing those folding stadium seats when they were modifying the old centerfield.
Cut to 5000 people waiting at the broomall McDonald’s every morning to see Jason. 😂😂😂
Sprinklering🤣
REALLY disappointed we didn’t see any Billdos flying.
These guys are awesom.
Caffeine makes dehydration worse!! Drink water silly!!!!
this dudes dating tswift💀
kelce brothers are the best  🇵🇹💪
McGriddles are the best breakfast menu
LMFAO!
Imagine if Buffalo didn't trade that 10th pick to KC and Buffalo Got Mahomes....
Not enough calories per dollar 😂😂😂😂😂
Travis keeping his fucking arms down 😂
So funny
You look awesomely HOT😂
Hahahahahahaaaaaaaa
You guys are WINNING on and off the field. You bring so much joy! I’m here for it. Dallas, Texas In the house. 🏈
😂😂😂😂
The beer bottle bowl happened because the refs missed a call then 2 plays later went back and called it. I have never heard that happening before or since and I'm a Lions fan!😂
Dr. Pepper is the most  superior soda!
LOL 45:17
The KEL-SEE BROTHERS ARE A CLASS  ACT
Hilarious
I’ve been anxiously waiting for this episode. NEW NEWS I LOVE NEW HEIGHTS PODCASTS
Lmfao Jason it's more expensive ordering a la carte than getting the meal 😂😂
This is my favorite podcast! I love their brotherly chemistry 😂
The NFL is hard but I think especially AFC is a monster, it's hard to be consistent (outside Chiefs current dynasty), there is so many very good teams. Bills have no reason to worry.
I have never had “highest calories” as my food order goal… 😮
Press the LIKE button 92%ers
Awww I love that Jason was like I didn’t get the Cheesecake Factory reference. That’s a big bro for ya
In Philly they sell aluminum bottles
Ten cent beers- it was Cleveland Baseball
The refs went back to a play 2 plays prior to the one they stopped to call a penalty. Cost Cleveland the game, hence Bottlegate. We have been cursed ever since
Nothing like a good snowball fight!!!
Travis, you have the perfect voice for a podcast!  And Jason, your voice is perfect for a commentary booth!  I just love you guys and love your podcast!  I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to find your show. Huge fan of you both!!❤ 🏈
There was also a beer can instance in a nascar race. Jeff Gordon
Shocking turn of events...not ordering a hash brown is a sin
Can y’all do a youth football highlight video segments.
LOVE the McDonalds story. Danielle sounds so sweet!
You don’t get the lids to the aluminum bottles. And who wants to throw a $20 beer??!!!
OMG can Travis do the "damn, god damn" repeatedly! ha ha These guys are the best!
Looking forward to Sunday! I’m a Ravens fan that’s been rooting for you all season - hope it goes their way this time, but should be an epic game regardless!
You guys are awesome!   Thank you!!
I disagree with ya Trav saying the Chiefs "needed the win more" considering the last time a Super Bowl didn't include the Patriots or Chiefs it was 2013... So... Its been like 13 years bro lol
Yes aluminum bottles at Gillette
Can Jason sign for 1 year in KC? Rotate into the O-line? Would be fun for them, for us, maybe not Philly fans, but they’ll live. If next year is Travis’ last year (hope it’s not), going out together would be great. Esp if it’s at the SB again. Ignore me… I’m just dreaming here.
Just jumped on. Jason did you get out to eat some wings?
There is one thing better than a ice cold fountain Coke, and it's an ice cold glass bottle Coke.
Cleveland fans have been throwing batteries, beer cans, snow balls etc.. since the seventies
McDonald’s fries are the best
😂 Estos chicos son demasiado graciosos! Go chiefs!!!! Saludos desde Perú!!!
Love to both!  No beer bottles at stadiums in Miami (FL).  Aluminum and / or you have to drink from cup.  ✨ Jason’s beer looked like the mini size! 👍😎
People hating Bill's kicker and Mecole should hear this. Honest Trav.
They take the caps still lol so it doesn’t hurt as much 😂
Have we seen the AI JK Funko Pop figure yet??!!  We need these in our lives
I was in labor with my son during the browns “bottle gate”!  Even the dr was watching. Dec 16th.
I never laughed so much about the opening of an episode like I did this one 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   F**********ck 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kelce bros are great but I'm fully rooting *against* the chiefs this week! As a steelers fan, it's annoying cheering for a division rival but in my humble and very biased opinion, the afc north is the most competitive division in the nfl and if the ravens go to the bowl and win it, maybe people will put some respect on our division's name lol
Travis in thwe Zissou society
Listening to these guys takes the excitement of football up a notch.
Travis game day fit would make a good fit for a flamboyant Russian mobsters henchmen LMAO
A MN Vikings fan threw the bottle lol the hell.
Hello from Bloomington Indiana. You guys are awesome. Love your podcast.  You guys are so funny. Travis congratulations on making it to the next round.
This episode brought me to finally watch a whole episode minus just tiktok. And cowboys are superior
Jason I am not a big hash brown fan either, but you got to try it by adding it into the sandwich, its the best and my new fav. Adds a crunch to the sandwich lol
Mom of 4 sports sons 🎉 now we enjoy watching our grandchildren play and watching our sons be nervous 🎉😂❤..
Just got to say the rice stat  4 receptions for 65 yd is incorrect. I know this because I needed him to get 60  yards to win five thousand dollars. So close. I wish that Jason was correct on that stat line
Been waiting all week for you guys !! Don't stop anytime soon !
Good night from the Philippines.🥰
Love watching your podcast from 🇨🇦
Love hearing from players while they are actually playing, don’t know if that’s really been done much before
Im with Trav! The hashbrowns are where its at!
All the love here ❤ but the most ELECTRIC game of the weekend.... was Detroit. ❤ Hoping for Detroit v KC in Las Vegas!!
I absolutely LOVE the fact you guys except Taylor like she’s always been apart of the family! I dislike the hate so much people throw at yall! I’ve been a cheifs fan since before I could walk or talk! KC Baby forever!❤️ Tay&Travis make my life complete! Don’t let the hate ever bring yall down!
I agree with Jason. Nothing better than a McDonald’s Coke. ❤
Yasssss Travis, on that iced cold cherry Pepsi ❤
You got Justin dunley on the pics of the game
Jaaon is the man ❤
Is your chiropractor or Sports Doc your fave person???? I bet
Dude Jason I so wish you were still in the playoffs but I think it’s so amazing your supporting your brother ❤ also nice W travis
Jason genuinely feeling ripped off by combo meal fries is the most Jason thing I’ve ever heard 😂 “I go a la carte…I don’t want your combo; your f*cky f*cky, get four different things”
lol this is about to have so many views. 🇺🇸
Travis taking some hate away from Mecole on the fumble is such a baller, class move.  Great leadership.
Travis is such a real man. He blamed himself for the fumble by someone else. “It was my block that caused that.”
We need Kylie back on to talk about what she experienced during that game 😂😂😂😂😂
The dog sleeping on the couch ! 🐶
Omfg this is the one I’ve been waiting for
Good morning
G'day guys loved my first live. Sorry I couldn't stay 2am and I'm on my way to hospital. Love you both be safe well and be beasts!!! 👹👹👹🏹🏹🏹 #GoChiefs #GoManly 🏈🏉
Travis taking the fall for the fumble by Mecole - this is stand up team playing!!!
Coke is crack 😂
The best brother ever love u guys
Nick Bolton was also telling the Special teams to watch for the Fake.
the best
Are y'all restocking the turquoise hoodie?
I love 2 sausage egg cheese mcmuffins and a large coffee!   I don't need a hash   I like the mcgriddles too.
I would love a Jason jersey!
Travis, clean it up. Using fowl language does not look good on you…..have not heard your brother use that language in this podcast, why you?
How about those Lions!? Let's GO!!
As a Bills fan I already know this isn’t going to be fun for me to listen to… it is what it is. Lol Here we go.
There's something special about McDonalds fountain Coke - I forget what it is - but so much better than anywhere else!
Odds on New Heights crossing 2 million subs next week?
I have never clicked to see their podcast so fast as I did today 🤣🤣
I feel like Jason got new lighting… those eyes are twinkling!
Jason for President!
Wanna see Isiah Pacheco on the show sometime soon!
"The hummer came out the garage" 🤣
I saw the game watch stats from Sunday and it was the most watched game other than the superbowl here in Canada 🇨🇦 I think (not sure about in the US!) but shows how much these two attract a new audience to the NFL! I watched the whole game with my hubby for the first time (other than the Super Bowl) originally bcz of Taylor but dang, I had the BEST TIME!!! I stayed for the game play, stayed for Jason, stayed for the joy. I never felt that “welcomed” before to sit in on the game and bother my hubs or his friends with tons of annoying football questions about each play, but he really was just overjoyed that I was interested, even though he rolled his eyes at me hopping with excitement when they’d show the suite haha. Genuinely love that the Kelce family is what has interested me in football 🏈 ❤🎉 thanks for that. You guys give off the best big brother energy.
Guys, please hit the LIKE button
Mcskillet burrito was my best item from mcdonalds until they took it out. Smh
Ok but are there PANTS in Jason’s locker?
LFG LIONS 🦁
why didnt jason bring a shirt for jason
McGriddle > McMuffin
I agree sausage egg n cheese McMuffin is the best
You guys make my Wednesday mornings. Thanks
These guys are the best 💚❤️ Favorite days of the week is when a new episode comes out!
GUYS, LIKE THE VIDEO!!!!!
ROFL - half slab AND 2 [TWO!!] Z-Man!!
Everyone take a drink every time Travis says electric
Cuz you scared her hahaha
Jason Kelce for president?
So loving Sexy Batman today!! The Brotherly love between these two is legit..... Shout out to the Sooner Nation players on the Chiefs squad.. BOOMER!!!
McD's has the best fountain coke!!!
Can’t stop laughing at the dog on the couch in the background 🤣
Im convinced Micky D's puts extra carbonation in its fountain drinks which makes it taste like liquid crack (not that I know what that taste like..lol)
Sausage egg and cheese McMuffin is a favorite for sure.... but best sandwich? I don't think it beats the bagel sandwiches. Especially Steak Egg and Cheese. 👌💯
I watched an entire football game for the first time in my life when the chiefs just played buffalo. I’m really getting into football now. Thanks Taylor 😂❤
Congratulations!
Kansas City Joe’s is top tier
Love this podcast! Have watched from the beginning❤
100k and only 7k likes?? Come on now, 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Hi
I can’t get on the internet without seeing y’all two and I’m here for it. Lol
Kylie is my wife! y'all are slo wholesome
Travis - having seen you on SNL and also in commercials, you have so much acting talent .      The commercial with Ma-Auto is one example where your acting skills shine.      And ALL of the SNL skits, but particularly the American Girl cafe.
Nothing better than a fountain coke from McDonald's! My go to! Love you guys!
Ah man. Missed opportunity.  Wish Jason said" Two bigO TD's".
Screaming in the background
Tough game for us Bills fans but seeing Jason party with the mafia was a fantastic sight.  Go Bills..  Keep doing your thing Kelce Fam!
Jason, please come to the Ravens game! We love you! We are a multiple NFL family.....Eagles/Ravens :)  I love your wife too! She is naturally beautiful and so down to earth.
Yes POP! Us Ohioians know what it is!
Mcds coke all the way, I’m team Jason. I don’t do combos either Jason.
I could not get here fast enough
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I love these guys so much and im a Tn Titans Fan 🤦 but ill always root for these guys ❤️  Im hoping its LIONS VS CHIEFS in the Superbowl ❤️💙
Considering that McDonald's salt isn't just salt (google it), I wouldn't order fries or hash browns. Also, coke can eat through a sunburn, so I am not putting that in my body anymore. 😏  Just saying...
Bert and Ernie want their shirt back 🤣👍
Pop is the correct way to order a coke. Ty Jason.
Jason just play ONE season in KC 👀👀
McDonalds Marketing Team right now - immediately scrambles to make the new Jason Kelce Combo of (2) Sausage & Egg with a Black Coffee. Fun twist: Every 500th order - they switch the coffee out for a Coke....
Did they apply for their You Tube Button Award.
And Jason,what can I say,God Bless Kylie!Big Hug!
Needed you to catch a 3rd TD brother. Had you 3+ TD’s for +$910. But I also had you for an anytime TD and 2 or more TD’s so I wasn’t mad lol. Just wanted that extra 💰.
How long did it take for everyone to notice the Jason's dog passed out in the background? Lol
Maauto
New drinking game: take a shot every time Travis says electric.
I think we need a 2nd Kelce on the Chiefs squad :-) Also, what do you guys think of all this hype about the super bowl and playoffs are rigged?
Jason is hilarious talking about fashion KNOWING he doesn’t really care. Just doing it for his brother.
🫶🏻 best moment
Is the dog passed out on the couch back there? Or is it pillows lol 😂
Best podcast EVER
Thank you for just being yourselves here. Congrats Travis,Pat,and all the chiefs for a great win .And congrats Trav and Pat on breaking Gronk and Brady’s record!
Travis, I love your powder blue suit. 🎉
mac donald’s does their coke differently. have syrup cold. google it. it is colder than other fast food places
Am I the only one who would Ike to hear Jason talk about stuff other than football
Is Jason trolling Trav with that purple shirt? 😂
I hope you all enjoyed your time here in Buffalo, I think Jason did ♥️💙 - lifelong Bills fan, Swiftie, and now a fan of your family
“The hummer fell out the garage!” 😂😂😂
In Travs  fit Trav reminds me of the guy in the Natalie Portman movie when she was lil Super gangster and the actor swung down from the roof of the doorjamb shooting
Cherry cola is the best!!!  Man y’all make me miss the states
I love these guys' relationship with their cute ass intern!😂😂
McDonald's has a special blend so the Coke tastes different. Coke is SO much better than Pepsi...love from the south. We ask what kind of Coke do you want 😂😂
No more earrings, Trav!
So we're going to ignore the pregame fit perfectly matching Taylor's Anti-Hero outfit??
JASON KELCE FOR PRESIDENT
Travis you look like a white LeBron James in your outfit
Pepsi > Coke
I’m with Jason—-The sausage McMuffin with egg is the best thing McDonald’s has ever done. Edit: and I’m also not a combo guy!
That’s his where’s Waldo look 😂
Travis looks so handsome in his suit. No one could do it better.  Congratulations, Travis, you were amazing 75 yds 2 touchdowns, WOOHOO!  What was it 44 plays with 3 or 4 kneel downs (or whatever it is called)? I think so.  It is fantastic you and Patrick broke Brady's and Gronkowski's record. (16) only going up from there.
I love you guys
However Bills Mafia was rude and disrespected Chiefs fans that travels to watch our team!
Travis with the teenie weenie beanie.. Paul Rudd collab when
Did bills mafia hit you with a snowball?
Teeny weeny beanie
🏈YO PLAYA PLAYAZ U GOT THIS 4REALZZZ LETS CRUSH THIS 2DY U KNOW I HAVE🎫 ALL THE SUPER BOWL TICKETS U NEED HIT UP SCOTTY MERK GO CHIEFS
Jason, I'm proud that you didnt flip flops, even if you did take off your shirt. Sexy batman!!! And Travis, I personally loved your outfit! Mustard yellow is hard to pull off, but you rocked it!
Jason a hoarder lol
Go chiefs
That’s because Mc Ds has a different kind of fountain set up and that’s why McDs tastes better than any other  fountain Coke.  The manager told me the secret
Love Jason’s dog is just hanging out in the background!
Zero sugar but deadly fake sugar. Run for your life!
I just want to say Chief fans are a class act. After the game Tyler Bass kicker for the Bills received death threats and had to delete his social media over it. Tyler is a great player and human and did not deserve that. But Bills Chief and Steeler fans have donated to his charity which is awesome.
The dog! Love the dog. ❤
The NFL has picked San Francisco to win the.NFL by the Christmas card has them on top of the Christmas tree
ice cold wild cherry pepsi mmmm....
I relate so hard to the coffee / Coke story 😂.  I get a hot coffee with a little ice so I can drink it RIGHT away AND a Large Coke at Micky D’s.
Where’s Kylie? We need to see more of her!!
Why'dTravis remove his books from the little cabinet in the back 👀
I would listen to Jason read the phone book. So funny bro 😎
I’ve been waiting since 3am EST for your new episode.  I’m barely hanging on.   lol.
McDonald’s has the best mix for coke out of all the fast food places
Chiefs gonna run it back this year
These guys are awesome  Please Jason don’t leave. Stay one more year I have a feeling that next year is the one
I'm Doordashing in some breakfast, today.
aww I just noticed the sweet fur baby in the background <3
Best. Podcast. Ever. 🤣🙌🏼
Jason-FYI -Have you heard the new news about you and Kylie.   My Physical Therapist told me yesterday they announced on ESPN that Kylie is pregnant with your 4th child.  Lol.  She will have a cow.  I haven’t heard the news. Is this true naked boy. ???
Donate your trash!!!
Love you guys…. Y’all crack me up.     😂😂😂.
I am addicted to McDonald’s Coke!!!!! It is my drug of choice!
Have you seen the meme of Jason on top of the empire state building
You are going to get so many “mistake” Cokes now Jason! You may never get coffee again! 😂
Kelce brothers 🏈🏈
Poor Brandon. We love ya, Buddy!😂❤
I hope you both know that you have made so many of us “not so interested” in football very interested!! You’ve done a lot for the game! Love you both and your family!
I've been saying it for years - coffee just does not taste good and we've all just gaslit ourselves into liking it because we think we're supposed to, and Jason just basically admitted it as a die-hard coffee drinker when he said he thought Coca Cola was the best coffee he'd ever had
I hope y’all realize how much joy you bring to people. Win or lose this is always the best🙌🏼
You guys crack me up! Love your podcast.
Call me anything just don’t call me late for dinner 😂
Love the whiskey bottles in the locker!
McDonald's has the best Coke.
I became a fan of Chris Jones since he was on here. That clip was funny, like he was so disappointed.
I’m still not over the hashbrown
Hey micky ds  slip Jason some fries it will make his year!!! Also when retired get on the app and get ya free $hit
You guys are the best!! Go Chiefs!! From Garden Plain Ks
HOLY SHIT!  There are a lot of people watching!!
That smile on her face is contagious. You rock on Ms. Danielle!
Ill order the sausage, egg & cheese biscuit combo plus amd extra sausage, egg & biscuit biscuit. It called a combo & a bonus. Lol
I have never heard of anyone who likes Coke, and will drink a Pepsi! 😂😂😂 When they ask, is Pepsi ok? I say NO! Coke all the way!
Taylor Swift's Boyfriend  😊
I like Kelce over Kelcee 😜🙄😂
T&T is the radio tag line to talk about Travis & Tyler.  Music and everything.  MyTalk 107.1 minnesota
Hasbrown in your sausage egg and cheese
You can go by any name Trav-how about Taylor’s Boyfriend 😊
Can we call you Mr. Swift?
MR. SWIFT
Love the locker dividing walls…privacy + hooks to hang additional clothes leaving more room in locker.  But sorry Jason, yours is still an overflowing mess.
We call you Taylor's boyfriend! ❤
no hashbrowns is madness
😍
I’m sticking with El-Travador
Jason, I’m in Collegeville PA if you are around with those jerseys in the back of your truck and want to give them to super fans of yours!!!!! Love you my guy!!! ❤
Jason on combo meals... Travis dying at his random strongly held opinion...this is why we love new heights
Travis laughs is so contagious 😅😂
Jason for president!!!
When Homage puts that AWESOME photo of shirtless Jason on a t-shirt, I will immediately add it to my collection!💪🏽🍻
The dog stretched out chilling in the couch is my whole mood this morning 😂
Cherry flavor only belongs on pies & medicine boys. Definitely not soda.
No cherry
Someone sent Travis the coolest Jacket though!!
Get a PO Box Jason!
Jason, I love you. I do. But if you don’t remember to bring your own jeans to your premiere, how are you going to be bringing memorabilia to give out?? 😂
Who do you think will win between San Francisco and Detroit?
Hall of fame locker room
Can't beat McDonald's coke lol
In TX we call them coke.
Jason I am your biggest fan in Ontario Canada!
New Heights to the moon !!
TRUE FACT: McDonalds has their own unique flavor of syrup for the Coke products stored in their own stainless or aluminum containers. the syrup is usually in a plastic bag and cardboard box
I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone become a meme so quickly as shirtless, drunken Jason. Sometimes the internet is a dark place but then sometimes it totally redeems itself. 🤣
I’m sorry but Jason with all of that energy, YOU had a whole TEAMS worth of energy in you at that game where your brother kicked some ass!! You ain’t retiring, you still got one more game left in you buddy!!!  I effin love you, your cool ass family and OUR EAGLES!!!  GO BIRDS!!!! * also, I am a big fan of the bills mafia because of their insanity pre gaming!!!
Get MacDonalds and CokaCola on the Line!
A McDonald’s sprite hits so different. It’s like getting slapped in the face by a static TV. And cherry coke/pepsi at the movie theatre is underrated for sure.
Girl Scout cookies!!!!!!
McDonald’s has its own special version of CocaCola.
McDonald’s coke is so good because they get the syrup from Coca Cola in a stainless container that goes from the stainless air tight container to the soda fountain. Just a useless fact I read this week. 😂🤷‍♀️🙈
I build my own combo too 😊
Wild cherry pepsi is amazing (but it must have more high fructose syrup in the USA because the Canadian version tastes different.
DANIELLE 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
No comb for me!
Damn it, now I want McD breakfast
McDonald’s has a specific carbonation system for pop specifically for them!!
No Pepsi. McDonald's has a special Coca-Cola recipe and it's the STRAWS!
Ice cold dr pepper lol
The dog in the background 😂 just chillin’
Fountain root beer from Mc Dons is elite.
Cherry coke, cherry Pepsi, cheery dr pepper
Cherry Pepsi!! Yess!!!
Two 🐐s
I wait for this podcast every week❤
Pop!!! Cherry coke 😋
These two brothers NEVER fail to make my day! 💖 Every episode keeps getting better and better, I love it!
Real sugar Pepsi omg 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Yep Pepsi
Wait until he finds out about Whataburger breakfast
Good morning from Brazil!!! The game was incredible and Travis played like the best TE in the league of all time and that's what he is. Jason cheering was amazing!!! It needs to be in the next game. Taylor and Kylie are simply wonderful ❤!!! The show was complete!!!
Cherry Diet Pepsi is the best Travis!
Yes cherry Pepsi 🙌🏻🙌🏻
You guys are amazing
Wednesday is the best day week🫶🏻
❤ Taylor loves Travis!!!
Mexican coke 😉
I love that the simple things just make him so happy.
McDonalds pop is hands down the best!!!  🙌 the Coke there is pure perfection!
Is that Winnie or Baloo?
I look forward to Wednesday to listen to these two! Love this podcast❤
Yay go KC let’s go Kelce❤❤❤
McDonald’s COKE IS THE BEST!! ❤
Pop is the real term 😂
Pop, that's right. Pop!
Jason if youre going to start doing that at McDonalds, please let me know. I'll have to go get a job at McDonald's & you'll need to make a drive down to NC!!! PLEASE!
As a bills fan, I f*ckin love these bros. These guys are pure entertainers and absolute demons on the field. Gotta love football
Bills Mafia loves Jason 💙❤️
I see a dog 👀
Girls watch too!! Love you guys
I stopped watching football a decade ago. I am so sick of how long the games take and commercials are a huge annoyance. These guys especially Jason is slowly bringing me back
Jason's not wrong sausage, egg& cheese McMuffin the best
I’m ready to throw down.  The Sausage Egg and Cheese McMuffin the best item on the menu?!  GTFO.  I got Trav’s back on this one.  That hash brown is the single best thing on that menu.
Sausage egg & cheese McMuffin with extra sausage patty and black coffee.  The perfect order
Add a hash brown to that sausage and egg muffin to go to new heights!!!!
I agree the sausage egg cheese McMuffin is the best 9:46
Danielle is the best!! Agree on the coffee! She gets it right!
It's late in here 10:40 pm. I was listening on Spotify and came here to watch the video you guys. Good day everyone. Tc.
They do have the best coffee❤
🔥🔥🔥
Im with Travis on the Hashbrowns - it is by far McDonalds best item on their menu.
63k viewing!!
I’m with Trav the hasbrowns are awesome. I order an extra one. 😂
put the hash in the egger, thank me later
I saw Jason at the bills game only to see him❤😂
Hashbrowns are hands down the best! Jason u r missing out
You guys are the best! My favorite podcast 💜
Almost 2 million subscriber New heights 92%er lets do this make it 2 million
NO HASHBROWN 😵😵
JASON I LOVE YOU MAN NORTH PHILLY IN THE BUILDING LEHIGH ALLEGHENY
The amount of green flags these guys have is unbelieveable
Whoa Travis has strong feelings about hashbrowns 😂
NO HASH BROWNS?!
I don't like the hash browns 😂
LOVE YOU GUYS!! ❤❤
Just electric
Hashbrowns are the best lol
People would probably love a signed Kylie photo!
Commanders should have stayed Washington Football Team, I swear they would have been the best team name if so.
Travis totally has Kylie's back
Go birds
Jason you brought the electric! Loved it!
Do you have a patron

When Taylor is asked about her welcome to the Kelce family moment, she is guaranteed to say it was Jason ripping his shirt off at the Bills Chiefs playoff game.
I got distracted by the beautiful giant and fluffy dog behind jason ❤

Count down ❤
🎉
This has been my absolute favorite podcast out there! I love the football talk and the inside view but I also love the whole dynamic of the show, it really breaks down the wall between the famous NFL athlete and the regular everyday guys you are. So down to earth and relatable I love it!
Mama must be proud of her boys!!! ❤
READY for it! ALL of it!
Good morning from KC MO. Chiefs kingdom!!!!
Jason is the people’s champ!
Hey, from mid-Missouri!!! Good FOGGY mornin' to ya! ❤️🏈💛🏈❤️

neewwwwww NEWSSSS
Let's go, Let's Go! How bout those Chieeeeeefs! 😊 And how 'bout Jason Kelce cheering without his shirt 👕 on?!! 😅
Jason just showed why he was voted sexiest man
I truly hope Jason shares about hanging out with Miss Taylor 😊
Longest 10 min of my life
They always do!! These are the kinda guys I would hang out and game with!!!
What was once the Taylor watch......is now the Jason watch! The over/under for the Chiefs vs. Ravens annoucers to say the name "Taylor" is 4. The over/under for them to say the name "Jason" is a 100. I'm taking one under........and one over. (Sorry Taylor......there's a new sheriff in town.)
So excited!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I wait all week for this! These guys are my favorite ❤❤
are the o-line still chew tobacco in the locker....??? Or is the time over ??
Jason for President!
I have never been so hyped to listen to a Podcast lol
Jason's girl dad heart was on full display for the world to see Sunday. It was so sweet ❤
I love their podcast. They are both good wholesome men- good job raising these boys Mama Kelce! I pray my boys turn out as good as yours have.
2mil, let’s get it!
This is the perfect hump day show.
JASON KELCE IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL.
Waiting to see what Travis has to say about shirtless Jason!!
No dumb question.. came for Jason stayed for Tayvis. What exactly is a tight-end?
One good thing of Trav dating Taylor brought so much  recognition to these two! They are hilarious and very humble men! Love them! Taylor on the other hand.. not my cup of tea. She is too prudish and acts like she’s 15.
Maybe now we will understand why it's okay for the media to diss a woman cheering on a player but it's not only perfectly alright, but celebrated, when a man does.
♥️ you guys . So inspiring. Much love et blessings to you
LETS GO CHIEF.S, bring the trophy Home
Just watched the  documentary and great family.. BUT Jason your wife is a FN Rock star 💯💯💯💯 Great mother & wife she keeps that house together..  both of yall look so down to earth love it 💯💯💯🔥🔥
9:30
Kylie:"Jason promise me you will be on your best behavior"  Jason: "But I already promised other people I'd be on my worst behavior  and I gave my word"
Today’s podcast is already out on Apple Podcast! Waiting to watch it on YouTube
I stayed up so late watching the game. It was worth tge 2 hrs of sleep before work the next day. I loved seeing Jason, Kylie, and Taylor having fun.
imagine if the 89th episode is with Taylor...
Hi from UK. 👋 Can't wait to find out how much trouble Jason was in with Kylie. 😂  Love these podcasts. Jason for President!!! 😊
I love itttt
Good morning from the snowy finger lakes in upstate, NY. Truly enjoy this every week. As the oldest sibling in my family (and the only girl) I appreciate the positives messages you give each week both about football as well as family. I am have a son who played 3 sports in school. I applaud you and your family for the love and support it takes for you both to make it all the way to the NFL!
What are 93 percenters?
I think when Jason retires, he should go be Big Reds assistant coach 🏈💙
LFG CHHHHHHIIIIIIIEEEEEEFFFFFFSSSSSSS
I'm a Bills fan, but I love these guys!!!! I sat on a plane next to Travis and Jason's aunt and uncle the other day.They were very nice and they're so proud of these two!! I hope they had a great time in Buffalo!! I could see that Jason was and I loved every minute of it!!
Jason Kelce legit made a little girl's dream come true and changed her life forever bc of it. They use their celebrity for good. All while being the most humble & kind people.
Like 647 ❤
I wish you would post earlier so I can listen driving my 1 hour to work! Can’t wait to hear this one!
Hey guys! So enjoying playoff season. Baltimore is going to require top form. They are junkyard dogs! You can do it Patty and Travvy! Swifties energy coming your way!!!!!
Did you not hear the collective “ awwwww” when Jason held up both girls at the game? Women all over the world turned to their men and said “that, right there” is a sexy man! ❤️Jason and his family.
❤Football with the Chiefs and add Jason, Travis, Taylor, Kylie, Momma K and Dad K who could ask for more ❤Let the Games and Fun begin❤Much love luck and blessings to Everyone ❤Jason and Travis both were the BEST even Brady agreed ❤
The best  podcast
I can't wait for this episode. Lol. Ask Jason if Kylie forgot to pack his fan😂😂
Over 2k waiting and only 700ish likes?
Can y’all explain the neutral zone?
Smash that like button!!!!
So much Respect ❤❤❤
Jason after this upcoming weekend's game...We're Going Streaking!
💣💣💣
Impatiently waiting
Letsssss goooooooo  44 minutes left 🥲
Hello from California!! LOVE the Kelce bros!! Every time I see a reel from you guys? I stop and watch.. You bring a smile to my face! <3  Keep up the good work and thanks for being AMAZING humans <3
Jason stole the show in Buffalo 😂 what did Taylor think ? 😂
Trav crushed it Sunday! So proud of him! It was amazing to see him happy and proud of himself. They put their heart and soul into this game and life. How lucky are we to be 92%ers getting to watch them out here lifin’! ❤
These 2 are literally the greatest human beings!
The media- Kylie Kelce doesn’t like all the attention Taylor brings to the family.   Jason- hold my beer
LFG🔥🔥🔥
My god, can't wait!
I hate football, but I watch this every chance I get and laugh my behind off. It was great they gave the head's up for today's show, otherwise I would have caught it later on YouTube. Today I am going to watch it life. If Taylor had seen Travis doing this show since the start, she would have fallen in love with him and contacted HIM first. He has the best personality and sense of humor. So humble (if only DJT would watch and learn how to be humble & a good person).
This episode is going to be EPIC!
Ready for the start
Exciting nail biter game and lots of fun watching Jason at the game!
Why does Taylor act like a 15 yr old child and just want to be center of attention!? I’m here for Jason/Trav/Kylie❤️
The hsm 3 meme troyyyyyyyyy with Jason and Travis killed me😂😂
This will be epic...
I love them! Such amazing human beings 🥹❤️
You guys are the GREATEST!!!!  I am a Dallas Cowboys girl born and raised.....But Chiefs and Eagles are really my favorite Teams!!! Just ask my husband, LOL !!!! Thank you for all y'all do!!
I’m literally waiting for this!!! 60 more mins hahaha
Wednesdays are always the best💚
BET.  This will be an awesome episode ❤
I just finished listening to Spotify podcast, now can't wait to watch the YouTube version..so enjoyable!!🎉🎉
Who’s ready for this?
Can't wait!
Can’t wait to watch this episode!!!
The whole world has been waiting for this one since Sunday 😂😂😂
I wish I could post the Jason Kelce Funko pop that AI did
LETS GOOOOO!!! Love this Family!
Listened to the podcast and still here waiting. Great episode 💚💛
I am so excited!!
Trav........as  a Browns Fanatic.........Just BEAT them FKN  Ravens.........get 3 next week.........Get it done.......Edward T.....216
I love this show ❤😅
Time for some answers to some of this week's hard hitting questions. Specifically, Why didn't Jason bring a T-Shirt for Jason? 😂
This message goes out to all the haters especially the  broadcasters that want to get heat for saying dumbass things (I’m looking at you Tony’s Romo & Dungy as well as that loudmouth idiot Skip Bayless) you guys remind me of a heel in wrestling, you get everyone pissed off by what you say then get your ass handed to you. Leave Taylor Swift alone, the only thing she is guilty of is enjoying her life watching football and dating an NFL Superstar. She minds her own business, takes care of the staff that provides her food and drinks and has a blast watching the game and man she loves!!
Man to say these Kelce bro's are on top is an understatement.  Congrats to all the success on/off the field👏👏
Jason stole the show at our stadium & interacting with Bill Mafia while tailgating.  Mad props to you ❤️💙
This is going to be an epic show; cant wait for Jason's feedback on the suite experience.
Can’t wait for this! A little over a hour. Not for the Taylor stuff though 🤦🏻‍♀️She just seems too goody goody for that family and wants the attention at the shows. Not my cup of tea but love the boys and Kylie❤️ Mama and papa as well!
SOOOOO EXCITED for the episode can’t wait to hear all about the game and sideline activity. ❤️❤️
Good morning from Ravens nation! Can't wait to see you guys here. Even though I'm hoping the ravens win! Still love ya
I was on my way home from work one morning, when I stopped at a Southwest Virginia fast food place called pals! I ordered a sweet tea like I always do, when they gave me my drink, and after I had already left, I realized it was a Coke and I was kind of sad about it. Then I started this podcast and heard Jason also got a surprise Coke! So, maybe my day will turn around!
I am so glad Travis did that to the Bills; their fanbase is toxic af. How dare they take their pathetic insecurities out on Taylor.
When are we getting the Jason and Kylie reality show?! That is the TV content We are all waiting and needing! #inaworldfullofKardashiansbeaKylieKelce
Waiting for the podcast .
The day is finally here!!  🙌🏼
Jason lived his best life on Sunay supporting his little bro! Jason how does it feel to break the internet while drinking beers and supporting family!?
So looking forward to this podcast, Jason, will you be in Baltimore on Sunday cheering on Travis? Eagles fan hoping for a KC win, lets go!
Can’t wait to see Jason in Baltimore this weekend
I need to see Jason at one of the shows during the Tour
Good morning Boys.......Thanx .....from the 216..............Edward T
92 %er here from denver. My hubby is not happy with me. He wanted the other team to won, hahaha. I love that chiefs killed Buffalo.  I needed a new team to back. My broncos are donkeys lately.  KC is the team to watch from now till forever. Oh yeah,  love the tay thing and the kelce fam, as well!😅
As a bills fan fuck you Travis! as a fan of you guys it was awesome to see still. Jason jumping out of the suite and also picking up the 8 year old bills fan to say hi to Taylor got my waterworks going. Thank you both for being amazing people. Sports are sports and there will always be a hatred for the chiefs in me but glad to see two stand up guys be so successful and so sincere. Thank you.
Jason Kelce's fan base 📈📈📈
Do I have to wait until 9:30? Come on I’m awake nowww😢😂😂
Travis hoodie is giving reputation font✨️
OMG I wish I could see Kylie’s face when Jason was shirtless out of the suite!! I’m sure it was priceless!  You’re the best Jason!!🤣
Listening it in Spotify... Laughing so hard.. I died dead.....Jasooooooooooooonnn..Now we all know who is naughty and sneaky....
Good morning from Indiana!!! I think every boy mom was not shocked by that celebration at all lol I have raised a herd of boys so ❤ brother love!
Good morning
Always excited for a New Heights episode. Kelce Brothers being true to themselves is always a treat.
Good morning from Australia
Please tell me you have seen the viral funko pop someone made of Jason shirtless at the game on Sunday?! It is amazing. 😂😁
Waited all day (I'm uk) for this episode love the chiefs, kelces, love TS and Travis and found a new love for the nfl although gotta hand it up to Jason he put them on the "map" this week 😂 from caz uk
Are you a Jason Kelce Stan? Yes, yes I am 😂
it looks like a fun episode today !
Let’s gooooo💪 can’t wait for this one let’s go cheifs baby go get that dub 🔥
This one is gonna hurt. Loved seeing Jason do shots with the Mafia. And shirtless!! He definitely was the best part of that game. ☹
This going to be a great episode, love the podcast guy keep up the good work
I cannot wait for this to drop! This was further proof Jason needs to run for an office of something. The people have spoken- he’s a national treasure
I can't wait for the 'uno-reverse' card 😁
Feel like I have been waiting weeks for this episode to drop. Jason is the best big bro!
Here for it!!! Greetings from Florida!
Jason is the most Philly non-Philly transplant there ever was. He was pure 700 Level Sunday night and we must protect him at all costs.
Can't wait for this one!!! Happy Wednesday 92%ers! Have a great day - let's GOOOOOO!!  Listening to the episode on Spotify....it's epic!
Jason was rockin’ the best dad bod I have ever seen!
This is the story we need to hear 😂❤
Love the whole kelce family ❤️💚🦅
Can’t wait for my lunch break so I can hear it!
Wish Taylor would be a guest on the podcast it would break the internet @new heights
That clip of a shirtless Jason holding up the little girl Ella to say hello to Taylor got some 30-40 million views on different apps I believe! These guys are amazing and wholesome fun, we knew…but rest of the world is finding out too, alright now.😊
Love you two, 💚❤️
Dumb Question from Toledo, Ohio.   Hey New Heights. I was wondering if you are you familiar with Abbott and Costello because your discussion of whether straws have 1 or 2 hole or if a hotdog is a sandwich sounds a lot like an Abbott and Costello routine?   My dumb question is which one of you would be Abbott and which would be Costello? (I have my thoughts)
so excited!!!!
This will be THE most watched episode ever! 🙌
You have to give it to Jason ❤ the man is consistent when it comes to the important women in his life. With his lovely wife he brought the drunken A-game on the first meet, as he did with Taylor. I guess he thought if they like him when he is behaving badly and drunk of his a$$, they’re going to love him when he’s on his best behaviour. Freaking genius 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️
so excited!!! Trav gets to pull a Jason on Jason !! Also can we please get Kylie back on soon!🫶🏼💚
I can’t wait!!!
You guys make my day !!! 😊
🎉 new news! So hype cant wait!
These two are the best!
I’m so looking forward to another incredible Episode Today!. 💚❤️💚❤️
Good morning from Germany, great game, love your Podcast 😊🎉
🎉
The only New Heights episode that excites me the most 🫶
The anticipation!!
The Kelce Brothers stole the show in Buffalo on and off the field.
This will be the most viewed New Heights episode, I think this will surpass the Kylie episode
So excited for a happy Jason Kelce like we saw in Buffalo! 😊
Good morning from Kansas City Missouri.
Have a feeling it’s going to be a great episode!
No Dumb Question: Where do you guys stay for away games? Does your whole team rent out a hotel, or do you have to each book a room yourselves? Do you ever room with anyone on the team?! (P.S. Congratulation on all your guy’s success! It’s all truly well deserved!)
So excited for this week's show. Only wish it released earlier so I could listen at Wednesday dialysis. 💚💚
These guys win the internet today!!!
Sup boys
