Emma is a super model figured. Kendall never a super model figured.

I thought Emma was tall! Omg
Figure hugging not this season but baggy fit❤❤🎉🎉
Now we're all wondering if they really took a shot together Is there a picture somewhere?
is emma drunk in this
Kylie cant move her face
Emma chamberlain is on METH OBVIOUSLY
Who really cares about these useless people 😂😂😂
the fact that kylie is almost 5’7 and is like 5’10 in those heels at least 😭
In this video is something energy what I want more to my life. My rolemodels and fun smart interviewer. Perfect trio. I will remind that review after 10 years later.
This is so fake and awkward lol
Ok but that was funny “what do you guys have in common?” “I guess we have the same parents!”
is this what high society looks like?
I love Kylie
im very happy for Kylie
👑 The Best 🖤
👑🔥💞🌹
three geese, everything so cringe
...Their Dad is now a Woman...😉🙃
These dudes look like ladies!
These 2 are so sweet there parents raised them well bless them xx
California girls are the best..
I love their sister time together ❤️
I love this energy in this interview!!
❤ ⚜️❤ Fabulous, Beautiful Original and Modern looks, I love it.💕💕
they look amazing!
I haven't forgotten that Emma had Kendall's tequila on display during her AD house tour video!
kylie athra pora...korchumkoode nannaakamayirunnu....adtha pravashyam polikka...inshallah
So plastic people
Idk why people hate Kylie. She’s such a sweet person ig. Just because she was born with a silver spoon doesn’t make her all that bad😊
how much for half  an hour ?
This is so dumb
The downfall of Western civilization is upon us.
they did not have a "vogue get ready w/me" video coz they were issued not invited this yrs met gala
Emma makes me cringe so much in this interview
Happy birthday to Emma 🎂
Shes great but needs to learn microphone 101
Kendall is dressed like the spice girls
who's that reporter ? Such a bad use of the microphone ... Just do not understand how she is there lol
Kenny is so pretty
This is the greatest interview I’ve watched it like a million times 😂
If only Emma didn’t use the F word in the end, this would be a classy interview she ruined it!
i would love to be around emma chamberlain
We can tell Emma is ' THIRD JENNER ' 😂
I lost brain cells after listening to Kendall Jenner
Kendall “ the tower “ jenner
WHY IS THERE HYPE FOR EMMA
You are fools, who are watching these fools? You are agly without makeup.  ￼
But like Emma looks so lovely and gorgeous... Love her style and makeup
Кайли так мило смеётся) Когда я вижу как она улыбается,я тоже улыбаюсь
i love emma
looked like I'm watching the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) talking with the Jenners.
Why didn’t Hailey go to this years Met?
It’s crazy to see Emma meet celebs like them I know she’s a celeb herself now but just thinking if lil Emma on YouTube and now she’s all grown and meeting such high up people she must be so proud 🥹❤️
Kylie looks great. Her lips look like they haven't had as much filler or something. She should dissolve everything imo
That is cool
Kendall is giant compared to the rest of them haha especially with heels on too geez no wonder she’s got big ol clown 🤡 feet 👣
emma is the first person that i see the jenners sympathizing with lmao
These two are dry crackers
I mean idgaf fr  just watching this to see emma
Emma is just the whole vibe. Never a dull interview. Adore her!
Two big rolemodels! Jenners. I love it how relaxing feelings they've there in famous fashion party!
Kylie’s energy in this interview is the most genuine I’ve ever seen. She looks radiant ❤
I love how Emma (and others) is bringing swearing into “polite society”. It makes me happy after being scolded so many times in my youth for swearing and not understanding why. Who cares?!
How are these conversations real life 🥴
Lmaooo nah Kylie has to be drunk she’s hilarious
Emma is THE best
emma was BORN to do this
Emma seems to be skiing here
Kendall seems stoned and Kylie seems pleasantly buzzed and I love that for them 😭😂
Kylie 😅😂😂😂 Why are we alike bit damm sugar
تجنن
Kako je vještačka ovdje Ema..najprirodnija je bila na prvoj gali..
They both look so happy and look like there having fun 💗, and Kylie's personality came out 😊.
She's the best interviewer this things got.
the interviewer she is exaggerating in her reaction and it looks so fake
🌺🌺 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌼🌼🌼🌹 🌹Life under Islam is beautiful🌹 🌹 🌺🌺 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌼🌼🌼🌹🌹
kendall jenner looks great 🎉
Kendall and Kylie are so boring
Kylie it’s really beautiful. Those bad pictures taken by paparazzi are just that, BAD pictures. She is beautiful
Kylie looks really smaller 😅
Kylie looks nice, she has a twinkle her in her eye
Kylie has such a cute face
Kendal
Ughh like wait. Bc omg yess
Love both
I’m not really into “following” these girls, more so because I don’t pay attention. But I liked this convo. They genuinely seemed to have a great time talking.
It makes me happy their so nice to a YouTuber
The bar for being a celeb is so low they make the karjenners look like angels. At least these girls talk and act like decent people.
Kendall 😮❤
Interviewers do the most in the presence of the jenners and kardasians   What was even that
What makes them alike? Same doctor.
They both seem anxious but very nice and beautiful women.
Kylie’s upper lip is immobile
Kendall & Kylie 100% tipsy
The one in the red is so false
The mac ad before every vogue video 😢
Kendall looks amazing ❤
3 Girls 1 brain cell
Kylie looks glamorous 💖
the both liked the host ... threesome 👍
Is she high
What's going on? I tho the Jenner's/ Kardashians not going to met gala 2023. So it's just a fake rumors
you can tell they loved Emma cause they are actually laughing and genuine
Vogue should start doing their own "tonight show" esque segment where Emma is the host and she's interviewing guests about fashion and doing fashion inspired games
Language. Thoughts @vogue
Fcking shot? Low class
Grew up in the same house. Have the same parents 🤣🤣🤣
Kendal and Kylie are having a boys night out.
Kylie looked beautiful last night. I’m kind of on the boat of people that think she has done way to much to alter her appearance but she was GLOWING at the Met.
Annoying Emma being Annoyed Emma haha 😂
I love the fact that the more and more we wear less makeup like it’s perfect just a blush i concealer and mascara gloss and yup
Kylie doing so.drunk
Can't wait for kendall to co-host
These girls need to be more coherent
Kendall is 💕
Kylie is so cute and sweet everytime she talks❤
they literally talked about nothing lmao
thid was so cute...
A Emma fez a kylie sorrir, nem todos conseguem essa proeza!!!
Emma is crushing on Kendall.
Them 2🔥
When Kylie pops a Xanax before the carpet hehe
Kendull and Kylie.  The mean  girls at the Met Gala
I love the sarcasm! They all got the humor! I love people that have a sarcastic sense of humor!!!
so tell me, are you dating Bad Bunny?
look like circus  performers
it's great you can find Kendall easily in the met😂😂
Im praying for you Kylie and Kendall.......dream really big😇
This was so cute 🥰
Kendall being such a giant and Kylie so short it so funny
These 3 have the best chemistry.
Kendall looks so sweet in here. Love it
Only reason I’m subbed to vogue is cuz of Emma’s videos at the met every year. Plz never stop
the main event
Kylie looked so pretty
Did anyone notice Kendall's height?
Kendall become so tall 😂  U know how uncomfortable it is being that tall amongs non tall people? 😂😂😂
I need Amelia tho
And yet again, Emma slays. A YEARS LONG TRADITION AT THIS POINT
The interview was si ha a pleasant one!!! Awee.
ahhh emma!!!!!!!!1
How Kylie has ruined her face with that amount of make-up hiding plastic surgery and botox and much more chemicals 😢, watch her new Vogue makeup💄 tutorial
Emma you deserve an award
They both got something to prove since they both got canceled 😅
KYLIE WAS IN LOVE WITH EMMA AND IM IN LOVE WITH BOTH
I was laughing all through
Kylie looks ❤❤❤❤
LOVVEEEEEE👹
emma is the best interviewer!!
Be professional with the microphone. I couldn’t hear half the time the audio was in and out
I cant... how do people take how these 304s talk? Cringey af
Emma is a vibe!❤
“Sheeple” based Emma
ok but whats the point of a theme if you gonna show up wearing whatever you want?
Emma clearly made Kylie feel really comfortable but even then, Kylie’s personality seems so dry? She’s not actually saying anything at all, and when she says that Kendall and her have more in common, she’s not able to say why…part of me thinks that’s still anxiety yet she’s way more comfortable here than other typical interviews. Kendall definitely has more personality than her. I’d like to see Kylie say more than just “yeah…”
I didn’t feel like it is interview. More like random party conversation.
Can’t believe women actually look up to these people 🤦‍♂️
I'd Be So Nervous Talking To Themmm!
Did anyone notice how Kylie can't take her eyes off Emma🤗
I love Emma
I am 6'7"... *while wearing a 5-12 inches shoes*, just saying. Lol
Woman uses their cat aka cherry a lot
If all the interviews with the Kar-Jenners were so smooth and natural, I might have actually been a fan :D well done to Emma!
How did we evolve to talking like that?
this interview is chaotic
so cute fr
Emma is THE red carpet interviewer
2 of the 4 worst role models for young women
I see why people like Kylie Jenner. She seems so calm and chill
Wait I feel like Kendall made that co-hosting comment because she felt like Emma should have been holding the mic out for Kylie instead of her 🥴
Gurl, I’m smiling the whole interview watching it. I love it when girls support each other and enjoying themselves. ❣️
They looked horrible! Why are these mean girls going to these events! They have no gifts or talents and it should be Selena! What is going on with this world!
I remember the early days of emma when she used to go to her classes film her vlog, talked like Emma! And now what a transition , Her life changed dramatically
This is the best interview!!!! Emma is the only one ever who made Kylie feel this comfortable to talk
Emma’s Gemini be real Gemini-ing 🥵
Kylie looked so awkward.
kylie’s foundation way too dark
Somebody training them tonight
Kendall is 5’10. So she’s saying those shoes gave her 9 inches 🤨
Shes literally just talking to the celebs and throwing little q’s about their outfits here and there and that’s why it seems so natural and fun I live for her. Keep it up girly so proud of Emma!
Sorry but the lamest interview
The model that hasn’t measured herself lol
Emma was giving JoJo Siwa energy
Suscribe
Deep down Kylie is just as nervous as us lol
I absolutely love her dress ❤
Okay  Here the collection of plastic
LOVE THEM my sisters !!!
They must know her outside of this 😂 cause Kylie don’t give this at all in interviews
haha
She was a spaz to me
Everyone say the first born child is always have small height I don't think so look at kendal 😂😂😂😂
Who cares???
Kendall is huge lol, she's perfect.
They both looks so cute.
Emma got Kylie to laugh ease up
Honestly who really cares ? France is burning, banks are falling, people are poor. Young people won’t be able to afford what their grandparents could afford soon. It’s actually grotesque all of it and Karl wouldn’t approve of most the outfits anyway.
I feel like Emma keeps cutting them off
Mean girls
Emma is druuuuunk
Kendal is a natural with a microphone and fluent with her responses. Presented herself and Kylie beautifully. I especially loved she never used profanity in her vocabulary choices. Kudos mother Chris for a job well done. Both daughters are just lovely.
who cares about these to entitled brats....
So fun. 🎉🎉🎉
Emma Chamberlin better do these interviews till the day she dies
YASSSSS EMMA IS FULFILLING OUR DREAM SHES GETTING OUR NEEDS MET. WE LOVE EMMA AS AN INTERVIEWERAT THE MET
I think the only 1 laughing is you 😂
Emma is drunk
Kylie look older
Kendall head shot was really pretty that night. 🤗🖤✨
te amo emma
notice how Emma never made eye contact with Kylie, only with Kendall. that made me so uncomfortable
kylie has such gorgeous eyes 😭😩they’re so soft and sweet
Love interviewees groans
best interviewer ever! love her!
Kendall is so beautiful. Her outfit is gorgeous.
"WE just wanted to go for a little colour tonight, WE are transforming" - Kylie speaking of herself
We need a emma kylie .kendall  show cuz it so relaxing ❤
Kylie is the next kris she is mothering ❤
EMMA 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 YOURE AMAZING
keep emma forever. what a treasure. such a down to earth person but also can have a conversation with anyone. i’m so impressed
i love emma but i feel like she was looking more at kendall than kylie
Omg Emma is so perfect for this . Loved it
Is Emma chamberlain drunk what’s wrong with the way she talks and her eyes are on high beam
Kylie is so pyarriiii🥹🌸💕✨❕
I love Kendall ❤
This interviewer is so cringe 😬
Kylie is just radiating so much inner and outer beauty! She also seems so incredibly kind
Don't be decieved. Those are w1tches.
Did she just call us sheeple!?
BAD BUNNY
Jonkalarim nima dvotti. Kendal jonkam sog'inib kettimku qachon ko'rishamiz
Emma is seriously the best
kendall isnt 6'7 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Witches
HOW MUCH DO THESE PEOPLE REALKY AFFECT MY LIFE? 0-10 ? 0
Okay I’m just gonna say this. Girls can’t brag about “being taller than everyone there” when she is wearing 10 inch heels 😂😂. Bro they are putting men at crazy standards. If men could wear 10 inch heals then I would be 6’9” 😂
Love Emma🥰🩷

Pretty sisters. They look so comfortable with the interview ❤
Why tf Emma overreacting i used to like her but not anymore
Why do people watch this thing
I love how Kylie told Emma “ are you gonna take a shot with me “ they are so cool ❤
Emma seems super sweet but I don't understand people saying she's so 'natural' in these interviews. She's very over the top and forcing her reactions and energy and it makes me uncomfortable.
i love kylie so much
Leo
Is that the NBA joint that ever player has pass around lmfao
Bada Bing, talk about statuesque.
I just lost thousands of brain cells trying to understand what was interesting about this conversation.
not her fan but i loveee Kendall's hair
all the K looks this year were sooooo boring.
I dont like the jenner kardashns. Sorry. I'll just go to another video
my wife so tall 😮
We love Kylie
Why so much people hate Kylie?
The price the big plastic bottle looks expensive for the amount of juice it has.
Kendal is so tall and then why she wore high heels ? 😑 I love Kylie she’s so kind and lovely 🌸❤️ When she said “ You look gorge “ 🥹
What happened to Kendall Jenner's face?
i absolutely love long hair on emma!!
I love kylie
Emma is perfect for this role! She has wit and skill and almost reads it in these interviews
Y’all know kylie cozy because Emma looks like Timothee
Me when I’ve absolutely lost my $h*t
Kylie and a Giant
Emma is wow nice communication skills 👏
Kylie was like.....ummmmm I need a mic toooooooooo
lol I was gonna say how fake interviewer is, esp at the beggining, but then saw commetns down below that everybody compliments her. I guess for americans this is less fake than usuall.
❤❤❤❤❤
Kylie is absolutely gorgeous in this. Wow.
Boring, shady People.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They r so fun to talk to
U r so sweet together i lovvvveeee thiiiiisss
Mark Jacobs lost his mind on this outfit.  Did he hate Karl?
Kylie was so comfortable in this interview. Definitely the third Jenner. Her agent sent it. 👌
Kylieeee I loveee uuuuu🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Aww Kylsss✨✨🤍🤍🤍
They are beautiful inside and out ✨🤍
Lol. 'I think the better questions is, what makes us alike?' 'Okay, what makes you alike? 'I don't know...'
I get irritated the host should wait for them to talk and answer girllll slow down nnnn
Lmao why did Emma’s demeanor change when talking to them she’s like so giddy lol
Emma is the new E news anchor i remember GIULIANA RANCID before her racist comments to Zendeya that ended her career
emma giving off tipsy vibes lmao
Kylie had a blast never seen her laugh as much in an interview 🤣
👀🐍
The Kar-Jen only looks nice with black hair minus Khloé
I couldn't hear what she said... are they Hugh Hefner and a playboy bunny???
Emma Chamberlain needs to be there every year
3 beautiful women indeed
I guess you didn't get the memo its poofy black and white but she's calling she's going to do what she want she won't get invited next year
Kendall is so huge and biggest animal in the met gala
Manifesting to have this kind of confident bond with my friends where there’s  no awkward idk what to say anymore moments
I truly didn’t care for any of their looks….. Emma’s makeup…….Kendall’s outfit choice ….worse than Kylie’s but…… whatever 🤷🏽‍♀️… not like I was there 😂
What they do again?
Great video
Plssssss stop with the plastic surgery.
nice thight
Emma is so excited she sounds like she already had that shot they mentioned 😂❤
Interviewer has got to go! Terrible! GET A GRIP!
Please tell me this grown woman is not walkin’ around with no pants!
I have nothing against Emma but I truly don’t understand these compliments. There’s no substance to this girl’s interviews and it’s a rushed fan girl moment at best which is too grating to appreciate as wholesome.
wut? LOL
Those two girls have all of that money...and they're still unattractive lol
i love these duo
Mean girls
💖💖💖
kylie is deff on something
Kendall looks great
@voug I was supposed to be there with Kendall and Kyle and also Kim but I never gotten a invite to the event I really wanted to come but now is away to late maybe next year if you guys know anyone of the met gala please ask them to send an invitation to me please thx
This is probably what AI thinks a conversation between a few 20 year olds sounds like. Am I the only person that thinks these people are impersonating what it’s like to have a conversation and failed???
The witches of Hollywood
Bunch of rich white girls interacting with eachother… 🥴🙄 just lost 1927261719 brain cells having watched it… 😐
I've never seen Kylie really laugh like 1:47 while being interviewed!
Nor they would be so funny as best friends
EMMA CHAMBERLAIN the best in the world kylie stunning always and kendall such a vibe LOVE THEM 3.
Sorry but they did Emma wrong with that foundation. It’s too yellow for her. You can tell by her neck :/
why are the comments so positive i was cringing the whole time
ZERO DECENCY, ZERO MORALITY, NON CELEBRITIES AT ALL. IT ALL IS PURE VULGARITY
Honestly Emma’s energy is giving anxiety, I think she was drunk or coked out lol
emma's interview seems like natural it's like they're friends and talking about their outfits and hyping each other up
ohh i just love emma
Los Kartrashians 💩
I luvvvvvvvv Kylie’s dress 😩😩😩
EMMMMAAAAAA
I love Emma
emma's improved a lot over the past couple years
I love Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner
is kendall like 6’3”?
Ok but Kylie really could’ve ate and gave a regular Grammys look.
The garbage of our society
🫶🏾🫶🏾
I love Emma! You are the Queen girl!
Lovely as always Miss
Lol i wish i could have a met gala girls night :( lmao
I never realised how big Kendal is and how petite Emma is 🤯
So happy to see Kyle has got her groove back and her confidence you look great kyle
Kylie and Kendall looked stunning ❤ love them they both looked so cute and kind in here
Oh puhleeez.... what drivel...ho hum
stop emma is literally the definition of a great interviewer !!!!!!!1 she makes it look so natural and fun omfg i love her
Both sisters .. stunning
I’m so in love with the friendship between Emma and Kylie like the way Kylie was just laughing at emma vibe is amazing
Omg ... I would love to have that shallow life
Women with certain features are suspected of being TRANS everyday👀
love kylie
Kendal genuinely seems so sweet here. If Kendall would ever cohost that would be epic!
They look beautiful, stylish and gorgeous. Perfect Met Gala.
mmmyyyeah
Kylie please talk in the mic 🎤
So proud of my little Emma. Honestly, I'm so happy and proud of how far she's come.
you cant tell me kylie is not drunk here😂
i love thissss
Andy
Kylie looks so calm and happy
Please Emma needs to be hired every year!!! 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🔥🔥🔥🔥
kylie was so nice to emma i loved it
the way emma chamberlain says looovvvvvveee makes me wanna punch her face
everyone slayyyy 😊😊
Probably the 2 most beautiful women in the, world
Kendall told Emma she looks stunning and Emma ignored it 😔😔😔
If people think Kylie doesn’t fit the theme, and want to drag her for it: then please do the same to pedro pascal, Salma Hayek, the girl with pink dress, Lil Nas X, etc. all of you will tell Kylie she didn’t fit the theme, and praise everyone else for doing the same thing. It’s a nice classy elegant dress that suits her and is still different because the train transforms into a blazer styled gown
she is super funny:) I have nothing against Emma but i can't get over the fact she bullied a girl in her school and was so unapologetic about it..
Kylie looks amazing!! Her face is like more natural and beautiful woww ❤
Kendall is so pretty
bella in the back!
emma is at the point of being interviewd, not doing the interviews.
Please no more emma chamberlain...all the best to her but rdy to see someone else interview on the carpet
I had no idea until today that Emma was so short or maybe Kendall is too tall..🤔
I'm soooo over the Kardashians. stop making this sort of people relevent.
I cant believe Kendall is actually introverted
Omg Kendall is taller than them both
Kendall is so pretty
“I feel like the biggest question is how are we similar?”…. “Okay, how are you similar?” …. “HAHAH, I don’t know!” Like, what??? Lol
kylie seems sooo sweet!! you can just tell
0:41  Could tell they are wayyyy nicer
Self absorbed,  selfish and phony/woke people with no class whatsoever! Do they ever do anything that will help people that have no money or no place to live? Let's see how they would survive without their expensive clothes,  mansions, cars and money..
Love Emma!!!!
It looks like it’s just me that didn’t like emma in this interview she seems like she’s trying so hard and loud
i love emmas energy
Humanity is so done... time to leave earth.
FFS 🤦‍♂️ What a Clown 🤡 Show
Love emma❤
Being black on a Friday night don't be a menace
Emma does NOT belong on red carpet.  She has the most obnoxious voice and facial expressions.  She has energy, but that alone doesn't make her watchable.
kylie is the worst in dressed kardashian, even Kris has better taste
I love seeing Emma at the met ❤
One day kendall Jenner will be the president of America. All Americans will bow to her. She is the queen of America
Like who really cares. Like you know like!!!!!
The agenda of commodifying women works powerfully by stripping them and presenting them as something to look at.
I love you both! ❤
If kylie doesn’t respect the theme and act like she doing us a favor for showing up😂😂 girl bye you don’t doing us a favour You will never be in that position. just please Don't invite this ridiculousness next year to the met … give us nothing.
يهبلون
Emma is such a natural with the interviewing like it looked so genuine
Not gonna lie, I’m not the biggest KarJenner fan BUT they were so sweet to our Emma here ! Loved this interaction
Emma was made to be a red carpet interviewer. The energy is immaculate
Is this interviewer the same that interviewed jack Harlow and laughed after saying love you
❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
Yuck💩🤡🤢👹👺
Emma, vous êtes heureuse avec les filles, Donc ce sont deux sœurs qui parlaient avec vous, elles aussi étaient heureuses de vous côtoyer. La vie offre d' agréables moments. Emma, ​​you are happy with the girls, So it was two sisters who spoke with you, they too were happy to be around you. Life offers pleasant moments.
Kylie don't have no makeup on does anybody that I do
Come on already we’re done with the Kardashians and Jenners time to class up the met
Emma is so beautiful!
is it ok to say, it's  the Worst Met Gala evaaa.... Leave celebrity's choice of dress why the Carpet is so off.. & i swear kylie's blue coat fabric looked so cheap & almost mixed in the carpet... Kendall wearing those black panties lyk there's a reason why they called undergarment. .. Big Nooo....!!!!
This is the most genuine we've seen Kylie in a looong time. Honestly being pushed into the fame really took a toll on her. She usually looks uncomfortable.
Kylie seemed so sad😢
Kendall looks like a WWE wrestler goes to prom. TACKY!
OMG I LOVE EMMA
Kylie looks so pretty
Great energy and all of them looked exceptionally beautiful.
.
Vogue REALLY
when kylie complimented emma thats looked so fake smh
emma was high
I'm loving Emma's interviews, please Vogue allow her to do Met Gala interviews
When you have the same doctor
Kendall holding mic for Kylie is the most adorable thing I've seen today..♥️
Kylie having snacks is actually adorable
seeing kylie and emma in the same room is like clashing both of my worlds
I don’t like y’all. Like.. at all. My friend Briana needs your help. So can we stop talking about your stupid outfits and save her life? Thanks.
I know my girls Emma wanted to ask Kylee about Timothee)))))
Emma has legally changed her name to Kemma so she can be the 3rd Jenner
Kylie looks so much like Kris its crazy I never noticed how much they look alike
Kendall is the only one that’s natural all others have had plastic surgery
Kylie ❣️❣️❣️😘😘😘
Love jennerrrrr
hahahha she has the best energy ever
Emma is very natural with how the flow of the conversation should be and which questions need to be asked. Kylie and kendall were genuinely very happy to be there
i didn’t realize until this video how amazing Kylie’s dress was
Kylie looks so pretty it's nice to see her smile like this she looks so natural
By vogue, can we get invite the barefoot contessa, Alison Roman, Jonah rider, Abernathy, why aren’t  the food peeps at ty met it’s always the sameeee people
Both outfit are the worse this year
The diamonds make them alike
I love Emma she’s the best keep her forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hps look 🍋🍋🎫
Emma is so perfect y'all are lucky to have her
Kendall is a total show stopper! That Girl NEVER disappoints!
Ugh
This was cringe to me
is emma drunk for this one? or on molly? whats going on hahaha
this was so funny and cute
Kylie lips looking thinner and it suits her more
emma the whole interview: “I’M THE THIRD JENNER”
girl love the third jenner lmao
Kylie looks so beautiful smiling 😍
All interviews with Emma are so comfortable to watch, she is such a wonderful icebreaker ♥
I love Emma so much
Did Kylie just say "Gorgh"? like wtf 🤣
emma is acting very drunk here 😭
I love Emma 🤣🤣
Sometimes I don’t hate them, hahaha!
Interesting…
emma found a way to make even the Kardashians seem genuine and real
Omg they love Emma it’s great
I thought they weren't invited?
It’s my first time seeing kylie laughing this way 🙂
Mds a emma entrevistando é TUDOW amei
Kylie’s public interaction has gotten so much better. She used to be so uncomfortable, but she has really settled into her own.
You can tell Kylie’s face wants to move so bad but the Botox doesn’t let it.😅
Emma is the best
the wake up sheeple 😭😭😭
Go to bed
EMMA is toooo great of an interviewer!!! Give her a raise!!
Kylie so cute
1:41 🤣
THIS IS HER 2ND TIME BEING A HOST IN MET GALA!!!! SO PROUD OF YOU EMBAAAAA
MY LOVEEEE
Interaction  was natural and should be what people train and look over for future events.
EMMA IS THE BEST INTERVIEWER
Hi I’m Kylie. I’m a billionaire. And yes. I’m off theme 🙄
love emma!!!! fantastic
kendall and kylie so beautiful and sweet and Emma is just lit ❤❤❤
Kendall looks like dinosaur 🦖😅
Ponytail and big lashes are so out😇
they both looks terrible like bro kendall wtf
Kylie looks stunning! And Kendal, or course as always, owning her model-ness, looking out of this world.
i hope emma never stops being the interviewer😂
Dumb white girls, especially the interviewer 🙄
So happy to see Emma back on the red carpet! She’s amazing!❤
was waiting for emma to ask kendall if she can spot timothee chalamet infront of kylie
Kendall is obviously not 6’7💀
Time to wake up people
Tbh Kendell looks like Deepika padukon
Emma's great!
Emma is a great interviewer and I like to see Kylie and Kendall being all smiles and relaxed. Also, Kylie’s dress was among my favs this year.
Emma making everyone around her feel comfortable 🫂 i think that's the best trait to have as a person
I love emma
It’s Kylie changing the question for me😩
A 6.7 former VS angel
First time in a long time seeing Kendall and Kylie looking and behaving normal and natural! Emma 3rd Jenner...😉 ❤
Two of my fav events in N.Y.C. is the Halloween Parade 👾 & The Met Halloween Gala!👹👹
this was so genuine, really natural feeling. im so proud of em, look at her go
How kylie is always not on theme?
Kylie is so shy in interviews its actually cute hahahaha
wait what is the theme this year?
Kylie always has snacks!!
It's like we saw a casual small talk, such a relaxed and cool vibe, love it, please more emma
This was a chef’s kiss interview. WELL DONE EMMA BABY
kendall and Emma,  Absolutely fantastic! 💗
Quit fan girling, embarrassing how brown a person nose gets..
FAKE
Kylie and Kendall❤❤
I love her style she always looks gorgeous
kylie didnt get the dress code?
Kendall is crazy tall,
She looks Awesome.
not kylie saying opposites attracts in the midst of the t chalamet rumors haha
Emma, you are brilliant. Thumbs up!
The Jenner's are invited but the K's. Haha
These two gives me nostalgia about my sister and I. ☺
I love kylie's glam this time 😍
Girls night but Benito was there in their car and then at the after prty with them 😂
Kendall will forever be the most relatable of that whole family
Kylie looks gorge here with this natural make up look
Met gala is stepping up for having Emma hosting❤️ honestly love her.
I'm the highest in the room.
Kendal is so gorgeous 😍❤️👑
Kylie telling opposites attracts 👀
❤
Kylie keeps saying we when talking about herself. Is she pregnant again haha?
WAKE UP SHEEPLE 😂
1:36 One of the first things they taught us at uni. during our psychology studies, was that siblings  *never* have the same childhood or perception of their childhood (because of how their brains are wired in different ways). They also said that this is because no parent/s  will have the exact same way of meeting their individual children (meeting as in- their needs etc).
I love kendall
Kylie looks so pretty. looks like her age 25. before she looked older,, now ok
Totally NO! Out of topic and Kendall isn’t classy with this “body suit”
Mean girls where
Emma has become the cringest and fakest human being recently
KENDALL YOUR NOSE PROCESS IS CLEAR ... AND KYLIE YOUR LIPS IS CLEAR TOO
Look at kylie omg❤
Where is song hye kyo
Nice great fascinating magnificent video 📹
I cant be the only one who finds the interviewer so annoying
$1u+$
What makes us alike? Ummmm like being sisters and stuff
Considering Kylie hates interviews, Emma has made her feel so comfortable which is the sign of a greater interviewer
❤❤❤
This interviewer is so annoying.
the way kylie didn’t even get to complete her outfit details
Love them!!!!!! Iconic
The Jenners have 'hair'/eye coordination.
That's one of the sweetest interview
Where are the real queens Ariana , bella , Selena and Taylor
Emma makes everyone feel so welcomed and comfortable, I saw Kylie and Kendall laughing like that after a longggg time❤️
let them talk😅
Kendall saying its girls night but leaves with Bad Bunny…..
Kendall saying its girls night but leaves with Bad Bunny…..
🤢🤢🤢🤢 group of bulying
Emma didn’t care about herself and care more about others. That’s speaks of who she’s
Wonder what Kendall will do if she wants to go to the ladies😂
Why does Kendall look much taller than Kylie? Although they are 4 inches gap? 🤔
Gorgeous
Lol Kendall is 5’10 not 6’7 lmaoooooo
Kendall looks so pretty!
Kendall nailed it!!
Kendall looks amazing in that dress
Kylie looked beautiful as always, but what was the story behind the outfit? Nothing about it fit the theme. She could have worn this to any other event. I really wish people would follow the rules because there will always be someone else who can meet the requirements and take their seat. Kendall looked gorgeous and definitely knew the assignment. Then again, she was probably much closer to Karl than Kylie was.
the only thing i am excited every year for met gala is to see emma interviewing celebrities.
I only clicked on this one because Bella Ramsey is in the background
Kylie needs to fire her stylist
"I think I'm 6'7" "She's the tallest person in the room"  *literally has platforms on*
Kylie does look skinny tho
i feel like its a girl night out indeed, the way kylie kendal and emma just giggling looks so cute lmao
Almost impossible to not like Emma 😂
kylie is so funny I cant 😂
Emma looks kinda high loll
They interrupt each other asf 😅😂
🖕kardashians.
Emma is so cute
i bet emma was dying to ask if kylie is actually dating timothee 😭
this is Emma’s third met where has the time gone 😭
wait why is it black now LOL
That’s a basketball player 😮
I have to say Kylie Jenner is the most beautiful creature on planet
Who?
the people demand the photo in the mirror of the toilets of the met gala 🫶🏻😁
I thought the Kardashians weren't going!!😂😓
They are perfect ❤️ stunning ❣️
This is the best interview Kylie and Kendall have done. Emma's energy is unmatched  I love it
Kendall is co-hosting next years ❤😂😂 Literally 👌🏻
Kardashian-Jenners again stole the met gala
Dumb conversation. Amazing dresses!!
Kylie and kendall look pretty here
Iconic duo
Tinggi gila pompuan ni😭😭😭😭😭

I thought they weren’t invited 🤷🏻‍♀️

They literally hate each other, wth is this hipocrisy
Haha amazing

Kylie looks like Kendals child😂
Kylie 美出新高度❤
Usually the younger sis will be taller than the elder sis, but I see it doesn't happen on Jenners😅
طويله ولابسه كعب ما يحتاج باينه كانها عملاق باتاك
I thought we're done with the Kardashians🥱
i mean, how can Emma do this like drinking water?
Kandall is so tall
نست تلبس
Ofc she gon be the tallest person with those 0:58 😂

I love them Kendall, Kylie and Emma❤
Kendall is so natural and beautiful

Awesome ♥️ 👍🏻
In my opinion this was definitely not Kendall’s year! Loved Kylie though! The simplest she dresses the cutest she looks!
Whoa " wait-are you my sister?"
Kendall is 6 foot 7??🙂🙂
Kylie is literally glowing ✨ She seems so much happier and in peace ! Is it just me ? 0:22 "opposite attracts" Is she talking about you know Mr. TC 😏  Just kidding 😂

I really in Love with Emma .. she’s the cutest ever
They’re so cute
I look forward to watching Emma’s interviews just as much as seeing the fashion. Never let her go!
Emma is such a great interviewer, i love how she do the interactions with ppl
Bro in the background at 0:46 😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
Fake fake fake fake fake …. Blahhhhhh hate the KJ’s
Emma is slaying. Keep her vogue
I loved this! I think this was one of the most real moments of Kylie and Kendall. Just being completely honest and just vibing.  it's so cute that Kylie bring's snacks with her everywhere <3
Get them another mic!!!!
Kendall is me y'all. I be that tall with heels on😁❤️
Kylie ALWAYS has snacks 😏
I love Kendall's body
So pretty
How are these girls still relevant? Stop giving these tr*ash airtime
If course this is on camera after all those dramas gatta present yourself per your PR and momager especially 😂😂
I’m sure Diana Vreeland would love this…
Kendall is sooo high
She’s comfortable around them
Emma is a queen in front of these two sw1nes
Acting and talking like class less slvts as always
Class less worth less mean wh 0 res have arrived
❤
i’m so pissed they didn’t even care to give king kylie the mic, or at least put it to HER mouth.
how do i drop worm wood on the heads of these dead manikins - oh yeah i threw a thousand daggers at you all
This conversation makes no sense😂😂😂😂😂 I feel like it’s a bunch of takes,I love it
this one was the best interview yet. the realest. felt so natural & i could relate fully. even had me laughing w them. just reminds me of my family and i. so sweet.
Yes
❤❤❤❤❤
Don't like there dress 😢 😂 mean girls 😂
Emma is perfect for this role! She’s got the wits, and skill to be on it, and almost mind read in these interviews. No awkward pauses, and she just knows what to say! Great job, Emma!!
I also came here to say that you can really tell that Kylie adores Emma! She stared through her soul lol, engaged a ton with her, and even went out of her way to say “will you take a shot with me? Come find me in there! That’s like friends type stuff! Someone asks you to take a shot, you know they’re your friend! ☺️
This is one of the best looks of Kylie Jenner. That red is popping, she is literally glowing.
finally a long interview lol
I WISH EMMA CAN INTERVIEW TIMOTHEE ONE DAY 😭
funny hoe emma is fangirling so hard when she consistently hanging out with kendall 😭
Why does Kylie always seem so insecure.
The KarJenner met gala flopped.There are so much more stunning models and celebs than them
Bullies
so they made it to the MET
Emma is beautiful and a natural at talking to everyone 🥹 she makes them feel special and I love her on Vogue
kylie was absolutely MESMERIZED by emma
kylie looks amazing
Kylie's face looks strange
i thought they were banned?
EMMA YOU SLAYED AT INTERVIEWA EVERYONE FEELS SO EASY WITH YOU

I cannot believe Emma  is interviewing at the met gala I’m so proud of her she’s so herself and silly and cool
Emma Chamberlain is such a natural red carpet interviewer. Fantastic energy. This is the most I have seen Kendall and Kylie smile all year.
Ew
This was the most awkward interview 😂😂 everyone seems awkward af
Kendall looks stunning
geez someone teach emma how to speak into a mic, she's holding it too close so either yelling and spitting into the mic or not talking into it at all
Kylie looks AMAZING!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jenners are invited ! 😶
what was the theme of the met?
Is Emma on drugs?
Only watching because I saw Emma
Love Kendall’s outfit. Love her down to earth personality here.
Am I the only one that felt like Emma wasn’t actually paying attention to Kylie? 🥲
Emma Jenner all the way!
Oh how I love Emma at the met gala 😭I genuinely hope it becomes tradition. So proud of her , always wishing her the best
Emma is way better than they could ever try to be. She is real they could never be no matter how hard they try
I REALLY LOVE THIS INTERACTION AAHH
Tall kendall should be a met gala theme next time.
I just don't care about emma chamberlain. I guess she's in the illuminati now lol. Over her she's so 2018
