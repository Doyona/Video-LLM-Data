ABSOLUTELY DO A FOLLOW UP. If they claim it's fixed... Then let's see it. And I'd recommend the same exact car, but with their patch installed. Not some handpicked model VinFast wants you to try.
It is Ukrainian car built in Vietnam with Chinese parts. What could go wrong?
Normally I'd cut a new car some slack while they work out all the kinks and refine it cause the company is brand new after all.  But that thing is all of the worst trends and features in modern cars. Gonna be a HAARRD pass for me.
Young people may not remember the Vietnam War, but VinFast represents a form of ultimate revenge.
The not being allowed to change lanes without signaling instantly means that it will be banned in California.  No CA driver would ever tolerate having to use their turn signal.
America hating on Vietnamese products...gee, who could have seen that coming!
If anything takes you places when in emergency it's the best
I really want to buy this car, it can’t be this bad
Toàn bọn mẽo hùa chê xe nước t 😂
shills
My 2020 Nissan Rouge chimes like hell. Does not bother me. It's helping me.....
Dump review
Type 3 issues should be mandated in India, especially for Reanult, they had my kiger for over 4 weeks due to lack of spares. The worst part is, Rats at Renault service garage damaged my Kiger even more.
Have you got the court paper from Vinfast. Hope you guy have enough money for decent lawyer. :)))
Need get some credit for this car ....now u can argue with it....😂
i think china version of the jeep thats in the US is better than that ev
Blinkers?  Are they testing a car or a horse?
I rode in a Vietnamese taxi in Saigon in 1969.  You could actually read the beer can labels inside the  bodywork of the car sitting in the back seat.
I think the drive aids helps a lot to avoid people not using blinker when turning. My car is a daihatsu rocky and it has The lane assist. It makes me more aware when i wanna turn and i instinctively turn on blinker always when turning. But if there is an emergency i can just swerve immediately.  The car also helps brakes if it notices obstacles at the front. I dunno if vinfast has an auto brake
Just launched in India. 😮
Oh by the way if you guý  go vietnam for vacation dont😂😂😂😂vi fast put all people complain in jails,,but now so many owners complain they just run out of rooms at local police station 😂😂😂
Honestly Vinfast came to india , first manufacturing plant outside Vietnam  They have launched VF6 and VF7  And honestly it's going to be tough for them
if you were to review this car in Vietnam, the company will sue you for "falsify claim"
Vinfast is now using political lobbying to force Vietnamese people to buy their vehicles (by using a soft form of charging station monopoly where the government restricts every company but Vingroup to build them), which failed miserably in every country in the world except for Vietnam. This company is a hypocrite and deserves to collapse.
Wait  i think i just  saw a new video of guy martin visiting this car's factory and loving the cars?!?
Vietnamese government is now forcing the people to buy electric car because no one is buying from this brand and its owner has strong ties with current communist party leaders
Well, that’s scary. It might be a couple of years later, but shit like this is why I won’t trust self driving cars. AI will never truly get an individual’s motives for doing what they do on the road, so I suspect that traffic will actually get worse if every car company goes fully self driving.  Yeah, I’ll stick to anything made before 2023. AI is already stealing people’s jobs and ruining technology and the economy, I don’t want it deciding how I drive as well.
You know what’s sad? After making this garbage and failing miserably to expand overseas, the Vietnamese government had no choice but to give Vinfast all the support it needed to sell it back to the Vietnamese. They did this because Vinfast had borrowed too much money from the government and couldn’t pay it back. Shameful.
nhục vãi cả c :)
I am from Vietnam. Exactly!
I have never seen anyone deliberately evaluate and deliberately put down the goods to make money like you, that's not good at all, I watched the video of famous YouTuber Kim Java reviewing the Vinfast very well, she bought it and used it for a while, she was so surprised about this car, she had to exclaim that this car is so good, it's even better than Tesla, but why are there 1 or 2 YouTubers deliberately speaking ill of Vinfast, it's so funny. So when you read my comment, I advise you to evaluate a little more fairly, don't just for the sake of making money, getting views, but speak ill of the reputation of a corporation like that, it's not good at all, my friend.
Why do you guys deliberately try to put down Vinfast? There is an American YouTuber named Kim Java who rated Vinfast cars as better than Tesla.
Do you know the fact is the vinfast company was build in Vietnam 🇻🇳
Df is vf lol
you would have been in jail if you criticize this garbage brand in vietnam lmao
All Americans; they all discriminate against Asian car brands; they do not dare to accept the fact that their cars are of inferior quality to Vinfast cars; and they feel ashamed of that; but those who have bought and used Vinfast cars in the US; they all rate it very well; even better than Tesla.

I'm a Vietnamese and I want to say that it's made in china not Vietnam. These cars are so bad to drive
I’m Vietnamese. I hate Vinfast. Boring, no style, just a box with four wheels.
I've just found this video out. As a Vietnamese, we despise Vinfast's ev because of how unreliable they are. I see one break down in the middle of the road like once every week. I've also test driven a vf7 at a auto convention and it was a terrible experience. Even though it was only for like 2km, the sound isolation is unbearable with it raining at the time, I couldn't hear what my friends were saying, it's that bad.
no one is talking about the fact that $50k is an absolutely insane price for this car. It should really be about half
They go for 20k with less then 1k miles on them is that still used? 😂
Make a follow up video!
The dude in the backseat is having such a good time 😂
Without blinker you can’t change lane in Volvo either
As a Vietnamese i can 100% say that this car is ass
There's a guy in the backseat? Did he get car sick?
And now those mf want to banned all the gas vehicles in Vietnam to force people buy this fucking brand, it's become terrible in VietNam when this company working with government to steal our money
i wish they would make cars that just drive and dont make any bleep sounds, no tv in the front. a key for the ignition..... just like the cars from 30 years ago. make an electric one like that... in the spirit of the corolla and stuff.
as a vietnamese i dont like vinfast at all because of its safety
Gosh...
Kênh này ba que phản động . Hoặc nhận tài trợ của bọn ba que . VF mãi đỉnh , Ford với Toy Kia Tesla tuổi cặc
Vinfast is from Vietnam, but I heard rumors that the brand owner bought a car chain or something from BMW and some parts of the car are from China... Also, the Vietnamese authorities are also trying to cover accidents caused by the Vinfast electric cars. When they catch fire, it's impossible to estinguish. Many, many flaws to be listed. Despite coming from Vietnam, I ABSOLUTELY hate this brand.
Good luck to the South East Asians buying from this brand.
Why our car got hate like this😢
VinFast should have started by humbly learning and focusing on A ~ B segment models, just as Japanese and S.Korean car manufacturers did in their early days. They seem to have forgotten the economic reality and purchasing power of ordinary Vietnamese people. While they might have given up on selling to their own people to target the global market, no country in the world is willing to buy a product that fails to sell in its own domestic market.
The company is Vietnamese, but all the parts are made in China. It's a really horrible hybrid.🇨🇳🇻🇳😂
Half of Vietnamese people, people not just consumers hated the Vinfast for many many reason. But the reason we hated this the most is that vinfast cars got into alot of burning dramas that invovled people life. You will not want to know the exact numbers. because we didn''t get to know too. the Vin Group basically brought the FB, Tiktok, new papers to cover up these dramas. We only get to know the ugliest
Vf3 try it 😅😊
A lot of this is biased input. So much band-wagoned opinions. Nothing original.
không ông nào xem hả ta?
Very good car vinfast by vietnam
At chimes: our car bips once 1 second so it is like this: bip.         Bip.             Bip……..
Vinfast chỉ bán ở mỹ để lấy thương hiệu... Kiếm tiền ở những quốc đang phát triển và mới nổi thì lợi nhuận tốt hơn nhiều ... Tesla đang bỏ quên người nghèo thế giới... Nhưng lợi nhuận  kiếm tiền từ người nghèo không hề thua cách họ đã làm...
back in the day one of the vietnamese youtube reviewer in vn gave them a bad review ended up being sue by the company lol
From what I've heard the company is in receivership. Even the name is not auspiciously appropriate.
The most shocking part is the rear suspension ,I doubt their engineers drop out of high school
50k for Kia wannabe

Aaaand that's exactly why this car is being sold within the U.S cause they know it's that bad.  Bet they wouldn't allow a Chinese car to do a try.
12:59 Even after fixing all the issues, it still doesn't compete with cars in a similar price range. It's a low-quality car with poor materials and build quality. There are much better options like the Tesla Model Y and Hyundai Ioniq 5, which offer trust, quality, reliability, and more.
Vin crash
Viet Cong car 😂🤣
Wow !!!  Vietcong car.
That's why Tesla goes with minimalistic design so they don't have anything moving inside the car and they can focus on the drivetrain
垃圾车，只有越南国内的民族主义者才会购买。
Vin crash
i don't think these "car reviewers" know how to properly review cars
Inviting garbage Vietnamese cars to sell in the U.S., while blocking good Chinese EVs from entering.
Great
I’ll stick with BYD or Hyundai…
Is it true that Vietnamese people claim Vinfast cars are better than BYD cars
He’s suc..king Elon kock. I don’t see him trashing cybertruck. With glue on body part
Seat belt interlock.  How quaint (1974).
I actually own a VF8 now, and theyve had their tweaks but omg is the highway still insanely nauseating. they need to tweak the suspension asap.
Watching this as vinfast just launched in India 😂 anyone who buys this crap is just asking for problems
Bmw replica
Chimes could be to keep attention. My car has that. I have it set high for long drives.
Việc nó cản trở việc bạn chuyển làn mà không có đèn nháy là quá nguy hiểm. Tôi đã gặp rất nhiều tình huống cần tránh một số chướng ngại vật trong thời gian rất ngắn (hố ổ gà, động vật, mảnh vụn, thậm chí cả những chiếc ô tô khác, v.v.) chiếc xe có thể không nhìn thấy và phải vượt qua vạch một chút. Chiếc xe này sẽ đẩy tôi trở lại với chúng
A whistleblower stated that the suspension could collapse with 25,000 miles on it. He stated that he warned how hideously dangerous it was before release, but was told to stfu because it would cost too much to fix. He stated he's designed many cars and no car is perfect but this was the one car he would NEVER ride in. Not only was the suspension bad but it was designed by some crappy Chinese manufacturer who had no experience of making those parts. There is no software fix for this, you're just driving a long at 50mph, hit a bump / pothole and next thing you know the car steers into a tree and you die. So this car is horribly dangerous.
Dont waste your money on a  vietnamese car.
Oh.... my.... A DONUT is just a donut forever.  Making is much much much more difficult than  just smearing, blackening  other country's products.  Small minded guys, nothing else.
When you are outside of Vietnam, they beg you to make another review. When you are in Vietnam, they call the cops on you.
My Kia bleeps and offers very weak steering resistance if I try to change lanes without indicating. Not a problem. I am not physically prevented from doing so.
They are smart.  I think they Bobby trapped the American medias by sending test models for people to do reviews. People will watch because of curiosity. Then they fixed and upgraded to a better version from negative reviews. Now people are buying them and leasing them....
Can't wait to see how much praise Vinfast will receive when they release their performance V line of cars in 15 years.
Bro ty for viewing my car vf3 ❤❤❤❤ that car made by viet nam bro vinfast is good bro
This car is trash. I like my Toyota 😊
Is the VF8 a deathtrap?
poor car is getting bullied
I have a 2024 VF8 none of the things you complain about are true with the 2024 model
Looks like they don't even have a uniform method of car production..the "bugs" being random and in different areas makes it lokk like the assembly line is al, over the place..the design is at fault to begin with..Japan can sleep at night..no competition 😢😢😢😢😢😢
All the complaints on this car are part of the American propaganda against foreign Goods
I thought start up ment not working at all won’t turn on
Startups and new businesses now have completely forgotten the principal of the MVP (minimum viable product). Instead of trying to match all the features of all competitors, build all the greatest bells and whistles, and have a totally complete product with every dream feature from launch you need to specialize and do the basics right first. If you're starting an EV company that means find a market segment with a gap (small sporty cheap EVs, Light Truck EVs, School Bus/School Van EVs, Fire Engine/Ladder Vehicle EVs, Ambulance EVs, &c). Figure out what the core essentials of that one thing are and focus all your energy on nailing those things perfectly. Then launch that simple, lower spec but really great product for the use case and capture a core market. Then with that add in a new feature set, capability, product range, or other addition in cycles every year/two years until you get where you plan to go. Since you're now working from a solid platform all the future work will actually be really good because you're not trying to fix a million little bugs, bad features, and PR issues while trying to make V2 of the product. It's not flashy, exciting, or ego boosting, but you actually get fans & a good reputation to trade on and that's invaluable for a startup.
americans just sh talking to this car bcos they dnt want to lower their ego, that some nations are better than theirs.
This is probably the best car in Vietnam.
It's electric? Never mind.
You guys should review Ola scooter s1 pro😂😂😂
Fisker should've done that issue program.
Retest this car. Vinfast update funtions new.
Nice camera rigging on the back seat, love it
Actually it’s worse than Chinese ev that everyone think it’s a junk.
They did sell alot of these pos cars in VN. Not anymore.  One sees very few of them over a couple years old. They have crazy failure rates. Alot of the electric ones catch fire randomly when driving, sitting, whatever.  I have personally witnessed two. Theyre poorly made pieces of garbage. Panels do t fit together right on most of them also.  This is how everything they produce is. Theyre just poorer less intelligent chinese.
Bayer Way
How is this road legal ? 😂 that blinker feature is mad
Wow, their first car, from idea to production in 7 years. Legacy carmakers should be very afraid.
GM & Ford which manufacturer pure crap 💩 have nothing to worry about with this 💩 commie company  Vietnam 🇻🇳 😂😂😂😂
Looks better than any Tesla!
You would think that with all the vehicle safety laws in this country that America would allow this car to be sold here is criminal . I have a feeling that a couple of politicians are making dime on this death trap . It does not matter how crappy a vehicle is , some one is going to buy it . Case in point , the not so Smart car .
This car is 737 max version of automobile 🚘
Vietnamese people wish America had won the war there. They envy south Korea
I hate the hyperbolic language of my fellow Americans. “Literally unbearable” means you unbuckle your seatbelt, open the driver’s side door, bail, and strike your head on a curb, leaving you unable to give a review of the vehicle.
That's  trashy car  I had one of those car   wayl I  was  driving it is  cut on the  fire  under the  hood
Ioniq 5 out of all of them is the only one worth it
How could this horror show be approved in the USA.
Electric crap.
Fifty grand? They are smoking crack.😮
I've heard that the over the air updates are not that--you have to take the vehicle to the dealership and wait hours for the update! I saw this with Out of Spec Motoring's channel.
I live in Vietnam and guess what. No on drives this thing except for taxis made from them
And this is why I don’t like electric cars. Electric cars are annoying and dangerous to driver in my opinion. 🤷‍♂️
new video idea take this thing and compare it to tesla and then others to see if it really is that bad
Jacobi Circles
Hegmann Divide
It could be worse than cheap Chinese EVs invading the world with CCP subsidies
Hang on, if the issues were already fixed by an update over the air, then why weren't they already fixed on the car they were driving? Best check when that update was released.
When you buy a car from the dealership, they should go over the car.
we need a new american car company. not an electric car company
"It has been ridiculing"?
So we can get this, but not a GR Yaris or dozens of other cool cars. Thanks big brother
when the congress passed 8  trillion dollars infrastructure  bill  what freeway they passed for ? 405 or 5 ?
VIN auto is Chinese cars venturing into the American market through a back channel.  These cars are only assembled in Vietnam not produced there.
No Chance whatsoever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Obama gave us the Fiat. Biden gave us the Vinfast. Notice a pattern here? Why are these poorly made, dangerous imports allowed into the US? Follow the money.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. What else should be expected from Americans reviwing Vietnamese products? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A family burned to death in my town of Pleasanton California a few weeks ago….this car hit a tree and exploded
You and your friend will not welcomed in Vietnam our country
that was a killer zoom-out
Electric car from Viet Nam.  Altogether now, "What could go wrong with that??"
VIN FAST is the WORST brand-name that I have heard in my life! 🤣 Does it stand for Vehicle Identification Number - Fast? We have a 65 mph Speed Limit, nation-wide. How fast do you want your car to be? 🤨  How fast do you want your license suspended? How fast would you like to enroll in Saturday morning driving school? How fast do you want to attend court? How fast do you want to begin your Community Service, etc?
worse thana boeing!
Jeez. What an overly edited video. I couldn't watch 2 minutes without getting annoying by the weird sound effects.
This car is dangerous....
They build a pretty good car even though you invaded them and committed genocide on their people
Came here after @Biturbomedia video on VinFast
Can you imagine how much $$$ it would cost Land Rover , to be giving $$ after the 3rd day , hell even Jaguar’s break down 😎
I drive vinfasts vf8 for 5 months and the Music speaker is muffing and later I come back again the speaker works clear like radio n music but driving everyday daily to work is saving my money from gas is really good
elegant, luxurious, comfortable and my family members all like it. Can you do a review of other Vinfast models such as VF9, VF8 lux, VF7? ,,
Are turn signals supposed to self cancel on lane changes?
Don’t even know how to make screws. Not even self research and development.  How you trust them?
What in the absolute fukk is a "VINFAST"   ??????????????????????
0:38  Look, I get it, you left ees h8 Musk now, but can we stop pretending that Tesla isn't the largest manufacturer in the world and keep showing irrelevant GM and Ford EVs when we all know Tesla is THE American EV company?
This stuff is called Banana software. The Banana ripes at the customer.
Its gotten this bad where you can tell a company is paying you guys for a mediocre review to cover over a dogs*** one peace out donut enjoy your khakis
IDK why some German car companies are in the USA
"Vinfast VF8"? Where can you even buy such a pile of crap?
Ive had to buy two mansions worth of car insurance to get to wage slave hell for three decades,  and if I’m 14 days late on my next mansions worth of insurance payment I become a criminal…..but these are allowed on roads.  That’s so interesting.
Looks like entire US car industry tried to find issues that are almost with every modern car and can be fixed quickly sometimes through infotainment.
Just burn it.
Can we talk about how the checklist kept changing?
How’s this different from modern turds
Customer Quality Control.
Vietnam is Communist. Communists do NOT innovate new things. They only take what others have already developed and many times cannot get it right. Just ask the Chinese who released the JAC car.
It would be decent to not chew gum all the time while we are looking at your face. Especially as a grown man.
Had the same chime issue with a 22 Nissan rental -- it was constantly beeping even when nothing was happening around me.  I'm in my lane, it's bringing me to a stop, at 20mph there's a descending chime, then at 3mph there's an ascending chime. The hell is it trying to tell me?
I test drove a VF8 today and it felt quite nice. Seems like a BMW iX3.
Give the company a few years and it's way past anything American or European.
How can be possible to buy a chinese car that costs 50k usd in a country that has historical brands such as Ford, Chefrolet, Cadillac etc. ?
Ah, good... You can't turn unless the blinker is on... So avoiding the runaway vehicle suddenly, cannot be done. So this car is designed to eliminate you?
Sorry all modern car chime hyundia tucson is dreadful  car next to you car inftont car behind speed changes you went near white line  your on a motorway your lights are on or off as for preventing changing lane with out blinker toyota rav and hyundia activity prevents you and chimes at you .
Hyundai tucson you cannot drive forward or reverse until you put your seat belt on . This is nothing new
I CANNOT COMPREHEND why a new company would offer such an expensive car.
Chrysler driving assistance is even worse - road trip in the us was hell !! Never again an american car... Glad to be back to driving my Mercedes.
I test drove one today and it felt pretty fine.
The huge flat screen tablet looks like an afterthought. The vehicle design is boring and looks like all the other boring competition. Two very good reasons not to buy ANY EV.
You want insufferable chimes ? The VF8 is nothing, try driving a Hyundai Kona!
Underdeveloped. Overhyped. But we will give you a hundred bucks.
This is not roadworthy. There should be a NHTSA roadworthiness certification similar to airplanes.
You are car guys and it took you over a minute and all you did was guess. Put a normal woman in the car and let’s see that minute?
Who'd have thought "Made in Vietnam" wasn't a sign of quality.
please do a geely coolray 2024 top of the line review guys
notice the Tesla Model 3 passing at 8:00 not a care in the world. Looks like this company is one major lawsuit away from become a household name.
Nothing but a time kill....YT pays for hours watched, why all the filler running their mouths about nothing just being comedians.  JUST SHOW IT ALREADY!
rip viet nam car :(
Chores can be turned off
They didn't test enough at all. They only tried the blinker and reverse once? Pretty poor testing imo

Except for the turn signal must be on for a turn, it seems like pretty much just an american thing to complain about everyshit they are not familiar with. This video just busted that with an honest review.
2 thằng đầu khấc
pull that fuse
I hope it’s not self driving. It comes with its own backseat driver so you never feel alone.
Dumb sucker if you buy this car!  They could not sell it in Vietnam so they used it for taxi.  Short range, terrible battery , high price and no charging infrastructure NO wonder it is a failure over there.  I was there in 2023 so i know intimately.  Of course they have no expertise to design and build one.  It was a join venture with China or Korea to build this thing.  The V.meses do the assembly part.  I WOULD NEVER BUY  ONE  even if it is good as i do not support or want those dirty  corrupted V.mese communists richer.  No one can do big business in VN if they don't have a dirty connection with the corrupted communist. China is exactly the same way.  Let's not forget V.N is a communist country.
China give you money to you make the video about vinfast?
Lets give em the ol web redemption!
Negativity over it because is a threat against all American Evs *cough TESLA cough* pretty obvious is corporate mandated reviews to make it look like a bad brand.
Vietnam is getting back at America for the war.
They try so hard to make EV cars weird and quirky that they end up making them unlikable and irritating. Tesla's famous lack of physical buttons is good example. In my mind, a properly done EV means I don't really notice much difference between it and an ICE car. At least not until it comes time to fuel it.
I can't wait to hear what Scotty Kilmer has to say about this.
There was a Vinfast crash in Pleasanton, California. A whole family was killed. I never heard whether the driver was at fault or whether it was due to something wrong with the car. Does anyone know?
Good thing you didn't have any preconceived ideas before testing this car... /whew.
Who wants to buy a ricer in the first place? I stick to my 1977 Lincoln Continental
Vietnam is just not a driving country.
No, indeed it does not look like it is from the future.   I guess we know the future is finally here.  I want to see Rich Rebuilds put a V8 in this thing.
It's funny that even Winfast has fewer flaws than any Tesla for 100+ thousand dollars 🤣    (Yes, cybertrak, I mean you)
If you have to make an emergency manuever, I guess not in a Vinfast. That is a dangerous vehicle. Destined to FAIL!!
To be fair china car still not in the US.
Do a follow up. Great video!
I’m sure liberals still like it!
This sounds like it was developed by the same Microsoft people who thought Clippy was a good idea.
Three things are required to produce a functional vehicle.  1, money, 2 know how and 3 tools. All three are needed at the same time.   Car development is a serious business,  not for amateurs and rookies.  When you buy a vehicle,  in effect you are buying the collective knowledge and skills of the engineers and executives.   Not to say newbies can't enter the car world, but to compare their maiden efforts with those from Ford  GM or Toyota and expect similar performance seems delusional to me.
This is literally the plot of American Auto (which was a funny show that should not have been cancelled)
Aside from the turning circle design flaw that can't be corrected, this car is dangerous as tested.
trash
Isn't this like driving while texting on your phone? This car sounds inherently dangerous.
vintrash
Why are we allowed to buy trash cars like these instead of byd cars or other chinese evs?
vietnamese and made in vietnam cars are trash.
A family of four was recently killed in one of these when it steered itself into a tree and then exploded in flames…Walnut Creek, CA
Holly EV hell man, not the type of publicity you want as a new car company. I just noticed they just open a dealership here next to a RollsRoyce/Bentley dealership owned by the same company.   The only great thing I see in this vehicle is the mandatory turning signal, which is something 99.99% of U.S. drivers *REFUSE* to use. I think that’s a magnificent achievement in automotive technology. No turning signal, no change of lanes.👍🏻
Learned something today....
Don't buy EVs definitely not Vietnamese made .they will burn to the ground.
good competitor for cybertrash
The start sequence seems completely normal to me - same as a Tesla. What do other cars do?
I have a baby. What if I want to start it up and cool the car before I put the baby in. How do I start up the car?
Take a look at the Vinfast share price …
Vinfast is a bold move in a car history, not only their brand is barely known by the world but they also making a car that almost bad as YuGo Koral and also, barely people buying it. But since it's Vietnamese brand we have to support our fellow ASEAN member to grow 🇮🇩❤️🇻🇳
Vinfast is used in VN mostly for taxi.  Very few can afford it and it has multiple issues especially the battery.  They could not sell it to the consumer with the high price tag and battery issue coupling with no charging infrastructure so they do the taxi thing.  Taxi is short trip and locally they can charge and that is only in their main city Saigon (No Saigon NOT Ho Chi Minh city only the communist calls that).  I was there last year so i ought to know. You drive outside Saigon   you are dead  meat with NO charging station.   These Vinfast people are too dumb of 1 thing.  Buying EV without charging station  is only 50% of the equation and only the fool, stupid or show off would buy one.   Vinafast is assembled in VN but the design and expertise come from nearby countries.  VN has no expertise, experience of know how  to develop EV from scratch.  Would I buy one as i live in the US? NO!!!!!!!!
Imagine complaining about the blinkers when 99% of drivers dont even know what that is
I have a Vinfast and I have had good success with it.  Super reliable and not super expensive.  For me. I highly recommend it.  4 stars.
Vinno sợ lắm
Trash car
They are perfecting their junk at your expense... wake up
Vin fast = vin crash ,vin thrash
lol
Lol you idiots think vinfast cares about making money? Bullshit. The company's president just wants a funnel to transfer his dirty money overseas.
Welcome back alive!
A family died in the Bay Area after this car crashed itself into a tree !
this company is nearly bankruptcy
Genesis had some relatively similar claims in their sales pitch when I got my G70... Free valet service every time the car needed "maintenance" and that was free too, but what they "meant" by free, and valet, and maintenance, and "you'll always have a brand new model of your car when its in the shop" quite drastically changed over 3 years of ownership. I haven't had a valet or even a courtesy vehicle, let's say most of the times.
First time I ever Heard of this car. My current newest car is 12 years old and I am terrified of having to get a new one. I am a pretty good driver, last fender bender in 1995… I really don’t want a vehicle that tries to drive for me or has tons of tech to eventually break or become obsolete before I want to trade in the car
It impresses me that no company makes a simple EV that doesn't look like a toy with all the screen BS around. Is it that difficult to just make a regular ass car that uses batteries instead of gas?
I felt like I am watching some horror video especially after learning an entire family hit a tree driving this car
I will never get a vinfast
Vinfast is not for smart people to buy. Remember that Folks...
I feel like it's one thing to get a day one patch for like games, for cars it's scary, like this implies they just didn't test drive their own car.
A family of four recently died driving this car and speeding into a tree.
Fanboy tesla review hahaha :). Look at the Tesla car, from the materials to the frame, the tires are all very rickety, it is far behind in terms of sturdiness compared to this car. Bring two cars close together and you will feel it. If so, you have to ask Tesla to lower the price of this car before you complain about those little things
Not sure I would trust a Vietnamese car this review proves it. Also my fav part was @ 3:07 lool
This car is perfect for the Donuts team to review 😂
LMAO, it's take 01:08:09 to start the car ?🤣
Stupid vid. Waste of time.
2 days ago a VF8 crashed into a tree in Pleasanton, CA, busted into flames, the car was locked from inside not allowing people to escape. Family of 4, parents and two kids, died from burns. Vinfast is pretty much a Chinese car, the Chinese use Vietnam as a gateway to import their cars to US. Consumers are being guinea pigs for China. Nobody can do a thing about this
of course .i will never register your channel
2024 Americans are dying for a cheap as dirt kinda reliable car. BUT 50k? Fifty Thousand Dollars. Hell nah. To the nah nah.
No Yugo SMH.
But this is not a video game. By the time they fix all the bugs, people may die.
I just can’t watch this with a guy chewing gum the whole time 🤮
The temu of ev
Before test : Vinfast After test : VinFUCK !!!
Stupid people who don't know how to use it think it's a mistake😂😂😂😂
I am actually looking to buy one, but your presentation makes me think twice, I will review more professional and unbiased reviews.  I wonder if you were paid for this clip!!!
“Thank you and we’re sorry” sums it up nicely.
Natalie, my heart goes out to you. My sister bought a Renault in the 80’s to give something new a chance. Didn’t work out so well. I hope some good Car-ma comes your way for your willingness and generosity here.
i drove one and had a good experience.  you guys are being petty
Vietnamese kids gonna be mad fr
who stomps the accelerator like that 😂 🤣🤣 I believe that's a feature, to prevent the driver to accidently hit the accelerator instead of break. I think it would be better if we have some kind of switch to turn it on or off.
VinFast has received more negative comments than any lemon cars in the past for example the subcompact YuGo car from the former communist country Yugoslavia around 1980. May be at that time people could not use a platform like YouTube as we have today.
You guys are both lucky because owners of VF8 in VN are invited to the police precinct to question why they don’t like the car which represents the Pride of Vietnamese Auto Industry. Imagine the CIA and the FBI at your doorsteps after you commented on the performance  of any kind of EV company sponsored by the government, want to ask you some “national security”questions.😅
With a smart phone updates are made as you schedule  and/or when you don’t use the phone. With VinFast the car could update itself while you’re driving under some special circumstances. How scary is it?
Great 👍❤️🌹💐🙏
We want to see the update
What about fit and finish though??? Mainly interior but exterior as well. Maybe they got something right??🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️. Also didn't mention that their cars aren't eligible for the government subsidies cause it's not made here in the States.
I am in Vietnam, I am living in a apartment which had builded by Vinhomes ( a subsidy of Vingroup as same as Vinfast), and I drive a VF5. And I am sorry because of my English, but I wanna tell you some untold story about Vinfast.  The car is good for me. It's not on the top of the world, but useful ones. Maybe, It's because I drive a super basic fundamental Vinfast electric car with no premium features (thank GOD).  However, Vinfast Customer Service will bring them to the inferno.   First of all, there was only 1 time when they sent me a notification for firmware update. I think it's 1st update version. I only know that there are newer firmware versions when I had a chit-chat with a Xanh SM's driver (a taxi provider of Vingroup). I asked "why? why couldnt I see any notification from Customer Service?", the driver just told me to go to forum (host by Vinfast) to update information. I also received the same answer from a Vinfast CS Staff. I sill dont know why they do not notify us about firmware update. No SMS, No Emal, No Call, No App Notification. Nothing   Second issue for me, it happend at the beginning of Ferb - 2024, a few day before our Tet vacation, so I wanted to make up my car a little bit. She needed an firmware update, and when everything's done, I found out that the e-Sim was not working. The car considered me as a guest, and I could not log in my account. So I brought her back to Service Center. After hours of waiting, they said they run a diagnostic, but could not detect the problem. It's last day of old Lunar Year, so they said there would be a new version of firmware after Tet vacation and I should come back at that time. OK!!!!!!   I waited a few day after Tet Vacation (because I received no notification about firmware update). Here is the 3rd fuckin' problem with Vinfast Customer Service. I came to Service Center at 11 AM. The Staff asked me "Do you have a appointment?", I said "No", so he gave me a number and told me to wait. 15 minutes - Nothing happend 30 minutes - I saw they called nobody name  50 minutes -  sit & wait  55 minutes - a car owner asked CS Staffs when they can start handover process (because we were waiting for a hour, and it's lunch time), but the staff just look at his computer, say something like "wait, just wait", then disappeared, all of them, the CS, the engineer, the worker. I had been there for 55 minutes but with most of car owner in that room, it's up to hours. Some of them are taxi driver of Xanh SM, that means they earned no single penny in that morning, did not even have a lunch (because they could not hand-over their car to Service Center, so they had to sit there and wait, could not go to anywhere). Meanwhile, VINFAST CUSTOMER SERVICE Staff, they had a good lunch, took a good nap, then came back to work after 1 PM with a good smell coffee. After ~ 120 minutes of waiting - it's my turn, FINALLY! Another process as same as my last vist. When it's done CS Staff told me that the new firmware "works well", my problem with e-Sim will be supported online. It was ~ 2 weeks ago, I heard nothing from them, I am still a guest on my own car. I called to Vinfast hotline, and you know what they say.  They say they 've not received my issue request yet!!!!
donut > blondie _-_
not many here understand the blinker situation, the lane detection thinks your drifting into the wrong lane, you can change lanes without a blinker it just lets you know.
One problem with this review is you guys are not familiar with electric cars at all. So you're comparing it to what you're used to.
how to start? Electrics don't typically have key or start button. push the brake is a good start.
The not being able to turn without using your blinkers sounds like a good idea since no one knows how to use their blinkers😂
Guys, the chimes can be adjusted to off if you actually go through the settings. So it is only annoying because you never turned it off in the first place.
I can buy a Mini van for $50000.
The “early access car” has arrived
In the same spirit of Vietnamese Communist product testing they will invite real people to walk on a new bridge to see if it stands instead of using  trucks filled with water for example. So does VinFast! You guys are their crash dummies.😅
Bank robbers would avoid hijacking VinFast EVs. Would it be a Plus for VinFast guys?
ZZ
Nực cười tôi không đánh giá thấp ai. Nhưng ngay khi bắt đầu tôi đã thấy 2 anh chàng này đang làm một video bẩn. Đặc biệt anh chàng tóc vàng râu quai nón, video đầu tiên tôi xem còn nghỉ anh ta sẽ góp phần làm hãng lắng nghe và thay đổi tốt cho người dùng, nhưng sau nhiều video có mặt hắn tôi thấy nực cười 😂 có lẽ anh ta là nhân viên của hãng xe nào đó chăng Thấy cách anh ta khởi động xe và làm những thao tác dư thừa. có lẽ anh ta nên tham gia một đoàn hài kịch, sẽ nổi tiếng sau 1 đêm 😂😂😂
Is this a scam? Is this illegal? The question we should all be asking especially for reviewers like yourself is why are you doing all the testing and quality control for them? Using the US market and their citizens as a testing dummy like Hyundai. They should've eliminated all these problems during trial phase. They should've paid you all that money for labor.
It is kind of funny with lane changing- in CA, it’s the law to use your turn signal to change lanes, law enforcement just doesn’t really enforce it
Try cars used by 80 million people in iran
note for people who don't know the vinfast is: Vinfast original from Vietnam. Vinfast was founded in 2017, VinFast is currently worth $85 billion
Shitty car😂😂😂
Fake made in china.
I can't stand watching people chew with their mouths open. Makes you look like a window-licking, knuckle-dragging troglodyte.
Interesting video
I like how they check every complain
What a strange thing to do
Looks good,  only time will tell, But I think it's worth a try.
Not bad for a 50grand
Wow
I wish one of the good day i will buy this car ❤
Not bad
The car has a beautiful exterior. The car is not as bad as people make it out to be
The worst, Eish imagine you have to avoid a accident but the accelerator doesn't work
Need to do some research on this vehicle new brand to me
Beautiful car with lekke sun roof
Beautiful interior though
Wow wish i can test drive this beauty ❤
👍👍
A few months ago, I actually saw a few of these on local freeways. Haven’t seen any since.
50k will get you a really nice lexus. No one in their right mind should ever have to put their life on the line and put up with this stress box. We went from having tough to handle cars in the rain to broken ones because of software.
The content isn't good enough to justify watching an ad for it. I'm out.
the vf8 sucks ngl. Rather than a vf8 get a vf7 its better or a fadil or a lux 2.0 its all better than vf8
you guys are lucky to post bad reviews about this car outside of Vietnam. in vietnam, everyone says or posts anything negatively about this car will get arrested by the police or get beaten up by the police thugs, usually undercover police as well. The owner of vinfast belongs to communist party and he is whitewashing ton of money for the officials there. The officials poured lot of money into this company so if anyone say anything negatively about this company in vietnam will get arrested or beaten up.
Beware of being sued by them😂
:))) guys We Vietnamese and we always buy Toyota or Honda Not that VinFast
At least, my Viet friends told me that this company is a joke 😂
Dude its competing with the Model Y. This car is a HUGE L lol
in my vietnam country, people call the seeder def for shjt cars "vin-fart" is 'crazy-bull'
5 M view
It's way too expensive . This should be 15 Grand car not 50
VinSlow 😂
And the Vietnamese kids say they're proud because of this, bruh😂😂
BMW driver gets in what is going I can’t Chang lanes oh yeah you have to turn on the blinker to change lanes wait what’s a blinker again😂
I just watched this after the update. I'm impressed by the turnaround. I think they'll hit their stride and then turn shitty in different ways like every other car car company ever. NISSAN.
I just noticed the steering wheel is warped! Probably been pointed out bedore but jeez🙄
Vinfart or Lostfaster, which name is official? You know it's actually a money laundry firm.
I live in Vietnam and these cars are everywhere here.
If you adjust your side mirrors properly, you will never have a blind spot, and don't need to look like a bobble head doll, turning your head to look over your shoulder in an extremely unsafe manner.  The BSM should NEVER have been invented, because it is useless for the reason I explained above. You should not, nor do you need to see the quarter panel of your car in the side mirror.
How many will it sell is the question
MAYBE after 10 years
In Vietnam we still operate normally, in the first review it seems like you should read the user manual like any other device, otherwise everything is fine, I hope your channel will become more famous🥰
In Vietnam we don't used . Used Japan car , US cars . In Vietnam vinfast has a taxi company . All of vf8 used for taxi taxi
Maybe cars in vietnam really suck so if you make a car that doesn't suck everyone hates it because it doesn't drive like their old car so they had to make a car that sucks to keep people happy. I'm kidding but it wouldn't be the first time someone made something shitty to keep people happy.
0:37 Is that "Volkswagon ID.4" intentional? :D
11:12 LMFAO I lost it
please open your mind, your horizon....
Chimes. I love my Kia Soul GT LIne (2023), but it chimes quite a bit and also momentarily mutes the sounds when making a stop at one of the e-stations.
Wow I hope they fix their issues and can make tangible improvements because I like the styling and definitely support a new brand building cars in the US.
You need Lada Granta in USA!
Kalo ada reviewer garis keras modelan mereka di indo, itu wuling, MG, Byd udah angkat kaki kali dipermalukan wkwkwk
Send it send it
vietnamese here, even people in vietnam hated it. My parents would considered someone stupid if they bought a vinfast im sorry for your bad experience with vinfast.
I want to see or hear u guys drive Tesla model y and 3 over bump or dip holes, unsmood road.... u feel all the impact... service center customers service  are s...
This is a best car ever made!!
Vinfast is so good, so beautiful ❤
한국도 50년 걸렸는대 벌써 차만드는건 흉내에 불과함
Wow!! No Man's Sky being used as an example outside the realm of video games!!! lol It really has become a GREAT GAME thou!! :D
I can tell one thing: Vietnam still need LONG way to go to compete the world auto market😂
Vinfast Việt Nam là hãng xe tuyệt vời. Hãng xe đã giới thiệu dãy sản phẩm phủ khắp các phân khúc và đạt được các chứng chỉ về An toàn tuyệt đối ❤️👍. Tôi thực sự tự hào về Vinfast Việt Nam Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Vietnamese
from the thumbnail i was sure it was a citroen
Vinfast doesn’t made by Vietnam! It assembled in Vietnam! All components is from other countries!
Vincrap is put together using old BMW German and Korean Hyundai manufacturer parts.
Haha! If you were in Vietnam, they would sue you for telling the truth!🤣
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hey guys, today is January 19 2024. Vinfast has NEW ELECTRIC PICKUP TRUCK CONCEPT – VF WILD. You can check it out.
Xe này quá tệ!
They are many products released with so many issues. They are not ready for consumer. All are about money but no quality.
Wooow I was just about to say it’s like an unfinished game getting updated after a bad but overhyped release   And immediately as Iean over to grab my phone to comment that you show the games I was thinking of in the video
More wasted resources to pollute the world
The fact that you can buy a Mach-e for less makes this car not worth it already
This car is good if been in it
This video is fake
Do you have plan to review again and see what they have improved?
In Vietnam, If you say bad things about Vinfet ( fet means fake and showoff) it will ask the police to arrest you, and torture you until you say Vinfet is No.1 or Vinfet is god.
That good PR make people remember you , instead of making the best car which is hard these days you can make the worst car ever
Wtf, 2 you guys are bullsh*t. The way you review VF is so dirty, dirty Donut!
So many 3quesola /// in here, they look very happy after 49 years 😂
The VinFast and Furious
In Vietnam, some people who review Vinfast cars negatively like you were bullied by Vinfast, they called the police to arrest the reviewer. This is a dictatorial real estate corporation that does business by shake dirty hands with the government to deprive people of their land. Luckily they can't touch you
You can find similar petty annoyances with all new cars. My son's new Nissan Pathfinder will not let you back a boat trailer unless you turn off the sensor.
They literally are willing to throw money at you;)😅
Damn. Dude in the green cap lost ALOT of weight.
You would not know the worst car until you have driven the Chinese cars !!!!
Even Vietnamese don't buy vinfast cars😂😂
I test drove the VF8 —- literally the wish EV
The question is, where is the car made. If China stay away.
Giờ thì Vinfast tốt hơn rất nhiều rồi, luôn lắng nghe khách hàng
The shuttering is because they're using a stupid ass fucking brushed motor goddammit instead of a brushless motor with controller
2 crazy guys
Another “Tesla killer”💀
I like my old Chevy’s, get in, turn the key and they start. The more new vehicles come out the more I love my 98 sierra and my 86 k20.
vinfast is created for a purpose of money laundering and short the shit out of the market
Oh heck no...
cant be worse then american crap cans
The Yugo of the 2020’s. Both from communist nations.
There is a third guy in the car! There is a third guy in the car!
They should fire their CEO for the price determination for just an entry -level quality.  Others set the price from low to high just for a reason to complete the overall quality and the next generation can be more complete being set at higher price.
It's basically a Chinese made car broken down into parts and reassembled in Vietnam.
Imagine doing a review and not doing a software update first so you can provide old info and milk another episode 🤦‍♂️
imagine us let Vietnamese cars in but not Chinese ones. LMAO
I would update the shocks.
can you borrow Vinfast VF8 2024 version and give it another try?
😰😰😰😰😰
lm from viet nam and lm sorry  because Vinfast  is so bad to drive in AMERICAN🥲
VinFast is the modern version of Yugo car of former Yougoslavia. It was so bad that car dealers would offer a free Yugo car to play with to any customer who wanted to buy their American car.
Well just buy a honda,toyota or subaru...
I think manufacturers should stop making vehicle aids because people turn them off,  ignore them, or depend totally on them instead of using their brains. Also....the men who complained about the car probably use wipes to clean themselves, and wear dresses!!! Not the donut guys:)
I got a 2023 vf8. It isnt even close to the video. Its too dramatic. I love this car. You can turn off the chime, blinkers are sensitive if you press hard its for a full turn, press light lightly for a 3 second blink. My lane assist actually work efficiently, i changed lane without using blinker doesnt have any issue i have a bad habit of that. I didnt get nausea.
The thing with the blinkers seems to be well-intentioned. A lot of two-and four-wheel vehicles in the country where I’m at could use something like that. A lot of people are complete garbage when it comes to making timely turn signals
It's a half baked Chinese car without too much software QA in riding controls, the customer's shouldn't expect too much.
This car isn't worth a dollar more than $22,000-$24,000 and then i think they would find success as a non thrills short range cheap EV.
Cảm ơn những người tiền sử đã hướng dẫn cách sử dụng chiếc xe này.
Guy with green hat looks like a mix between canelo Álvarez and Andrew Santino lol
Wow, a car that makes the Yugo look good!😂
It took you a minute of freaking out to figure out how to start an electric car the way that other electric cars start? That makes me think you aren't really qualified to review the car.
You are lucky not to be in VN right now otherwise VinFast will ask the police to force you to retract whatever you said about their “lemon cars” as it just happens to a Facebook guy named Sonnie or Sonny Tran who had the audacity to criticize VF8 performance like you guys and was interrogated  by the authorities for 35 hours and  charged him with misuse of freedom of speech based on Article 331 of the Vietnamese constitution. (Source: BNN Breaking News about VinFast vs Facebook Analyst)
In Vietnam VinFast tries to sell their EVs but to no avail due to poor performance and bad services. In order to get more buyers they have to offfer vouchers for vacation in their resorts and still people are afraid of owning VinFast EVs. To balance the losses they have to sell  EVs to their own taxi company to make the unsold  EVs “green taxis” to compete with the taxi companies   that operate  in the country.
So...starting the car shouldn't have been a mystery to them if they've ever been in a Tesla. You get in and just drive. There's no "start" button. The car recognizes you using the key fob and/or a phone app and it only operates for that person.
This is the worst company ever to work at, let alone their products. I’m Vietnamese and from Vietnam, last time I went back home this pos was everywhere. The company is the most unethical business I’ve ever seen. My close friend works there and his paycheck got reduced by 30% just bc he couldn’t make it on a business trip due to his dad was in intesive care at the hospital (he’s the only son and his parents are divorced). They’re always late on paying employees to the point my friend had to borrow money from me a few times to care for this dad. Absolutely ridiculous. I wish people in Vietnam would stop supporting this business but it’s hard since they own pretty much everything there.
lol I didn’t think anybody buying a car nowadays even uses their blinkers lol because cars have a lot of features I figured people just don’t give a fuck about them, even tho they should because they help.
Vietnamese here. In fact, you guys are absolutely right about how shitty that car is. Even in Vietnam, I see tons of these Vinfast car on tow truck and lots of video about the dead battery problems.
I would like to see another video, because I do not have a lot of faith in what they call fixing their issues. 😂    And yes, right now that car sucks the big one!
Fast to production.  OK.. At least they find all these problems so they can be corrected.  I am sure they started already.  End of the day could be a great company.  Definitely on the right track. How bad was GM at first? Well they weren't the greatest.
anyone noticed it goen from sunroof to drive aid?
VF is a laughing stock 🤣🤣🤣
I have to say my Genesis 3.3 Twin Turbo in Sport mode is slightly better than the VF8 🤣🤣
Oh sh.t you guys in big trouble, dont go to vietnam, they will call cops on you once you arrive at the airport, they have history call cops on people gave them bad review😂😂😂😂😂😂
VinFast VF8 is the cousin of Fentanyl. Don’t touch it or you will be Sorrrry !
VinFast has a lot of problems with its software and the Vietnamese VinFast technical team does not know how to fix it because it was written by the Chinese. VinFast claims that VF8 & VF9 are Made in Vietnam but they’re really assembled not made. And the parts are from (mainland) China. Due to the bad relations between the US and China, the Chinese have to use Vietnam as a bait to test the American market but it seems that is not working like they wish because VinFast EVs are worst than lemons: we cannot even make lemonade.
VinFast -> VinSlow -> VinDead
actually, all safety functions on VF8 is necessary on the ride. but, they can be optional by customers.
I would not even eat a can food packed in Vietnam, let alone put myself is a death trap machine like this car.
Made in China is pretty bad. But made in Vietnam is worse. Made in Japan and made in Korea are the only Asian brands worth paying for.
xịn quá xịn chê sao đc mấy a🤣
Those complaints could have been kept a secret if the price isn’t that enormous.
I disagree about the acceleration pedal, come on they are just trying to simulate turbo lag.
needs air suspension and real quality springs
Ngl even the video on this car gave me a headache 💀
It’s the first version, so I expect it will improve. If you don’t like electric vehicles, in the answer a simple.. don’t buy one. There are plenty of worse cars out there, like the late 1990s Dodge pick up truck that rolled coal on me just because I wasn’t driving another garbage can like his.
Worst car also in Vietnam. And you cant even complain about it in here. Your post will be delete. 😂😂😂 kinda like China over here. No freedom of speech
Hopefully they fix the issues. In the mean time, just get a Tesla model Y.
It looks like a knockoff Mazda/Tesla/BMW with somewhat of a Corvette steering wheel
😢 I believe in hybrid technology however all electric cars require a huge battery. That requires mining lithium which produces more pollution in air and water than our cars do! Add in they charge off coal burning power plants and the hazards to recycle add in the cars drive weird and aren't set up very well for the user. I think they should stop and look at hybrid tech or making the gas engines we have more efficient and or new fuel sources. Hydrogen has potential but too expensive so what other options do we have? We don't need more computers or gadgets we need more efficient and effective engine designs and fuel sources then add hybrid technology! Bam we have an actual eco friendly car ev is just a fad they don't actually help much for our eco system lol!
I'm Vietnamese but I think that giving vinfast a few more years will make all their car models more stable, with that price I'd rather buy a tesla than vinfast or other cars like the Ioniq 6.
Why would anyone pay $50k to be a software beta tester for the manufacturer of a potentially lethal machine?
50k? Rofl thats fucked
Audi Q8 E-tron and E-tron GT are exactly the EVs your looking for
It seems very brazen to me for them to dare to sell this car for $50,000... especially when reputable brands are selling competing vehicles for significantly cheaper.
Funniest car since the Yugo.
Surprise! Socialists building a car shouldn't be surprising anyone, that it turned out that way
A car isn't a video game.  The stakes are human lives vs $60.
10,000 vehicle being overpriced at $50,000
The startup sequence is all you need to know to figure out the genius engineering and logics behind everything else.
That’s a vinfast on the thumbnail🤠
Cheap ass Renault
If u look at the country itself u know shit is created
Let them perfect Pho
6:10
EVs are overpriced.  Just get a Camry for $25K instead of this.
Volkswagon????? Bruh who checked this video???
thier R&D for californians is really good...especially relying on loyal viet americans.  the idea of giving back cash kickbacks along the way as performance failures...is humble and real...like their culture...they've only done this for a few years.   i think they'll succeed and the whole V thing is cool.  suspension can be upgraded for a few Gs on each vehicle.  the electronic mapping also not too hard to fix.  overall, the idea that you spend 40K on a car but you still get 100s back on performance problems...very californian culture.  customers will still go through the pain of a new brand.
Blinkers don't work.  2 seconds later, check the green box...... Wtf
Our government allows this crap into the market, but not allowing those amazing Chinese EV here, unbelievable!
50K? FMUTAACMB!
I'll stick with my ICE vehicle.
100 dollars a day? That might be helpful for all those teenagers at Wendy's in places that still have insanely low minimum wages. You know, all those teenagers buying brand new SUVs for 50k
I don’t understand how NHTSA cleared this vehicle for the road.
Considering the price tag of $50,000, these are unacceptable issues.
A  2024 BMW i4 eDrive35 RWD cost the same
This car is still being sold in Vietnam Nam, we dont  know all the problems had been solved or not. There were some owners in troubles because of their complaints on social media🤪 5:52
12:53 making a normal car that is juts electric makes no sense. Why TF would an ev have a large front area if the motor is 1/6 the size if a gas motor? So many things you don't need when there is no loud, ditry, gas engine in a car.
Americans complaining about a single sound or a little balance  Looks like some people have too much free time
I'm sad to know that VinFast not owned by Vin Diesel
Further proof that EVs suck.
Commies can't build cars
I am fascinated by the idea of a Vietnamese car of any type, EV or not. Please, please, please, do a follow-up! If Natalie's willing to patch her car's firmware, and let you guys test-drive it again, I'd love to see what's been made better.  This whole video was really exciting, and fun to watch. A Vietnamese car on the global market... How exciting!
All these safety features are just making terrible drivers WORSE 😵
I saw people driving these shit boxes in my city (mtl) and wondered how does that car last especially on our roads!!!
lol 😂
Anything the viet cong made are liars.
Remember YuGo cars in the 80s of Yougoslavia a Socialist Country in the Soviet era? The company tried to sale their cars but to no avail like VinFast with their VF8s today. It was so desperate that some car dealers would offer a free YuGo if customers purchased American cars. One thing communists have in common: they think that people will buy their cars because they are patriots and those who don’t are traitors.
$50,000.00 for that thing.  NO WAY
What about the sunroof? That's the whole reason I watched the video. The steering lock no blinker tis but a scratch of a failure.
Buying an ev from a place that doest even have power through the entire country....seems dicey...
Buy a rivian
This car is a overpriced electric Yugo.
Our new Vietnam war.
Complicated mess.
In Vietnam, the communist polices will kick your door and arrest you if you complain about this car😂😂😂
It's from the fourth day onward because until the fourth day it's a type 2 claim, so you get the 300, and it gets repaired for 3 days, and then on the fourth day and on you get another 100 dollars. So, after about a year and four months of being in repair your car pays for itself!
Vinfast only car company called cops on the guy that gave them bad review on youtube in Vietnam. That so hilarious ...lmao
Are people gonna ignore the fact the he forgot to do rolling test 😂
It’s a crap car from the ground up
Wow  really  creepy  crappie  car  but  would  be  cool to.see if ova updates  fix  issues definitely  worth  another  feature review  😅😊😅
I didn't think there were people as rotten and despicable as these two guys in America
More expensive than Civic Type R FL5…. Sounds legit.
Part 2
This car is literally Cyberpunk 2077  1.0
Leftism has taken it's second run at destroying the automobile industry..
That's the thing people rely on these electronic in vehicles now it's stupid! It all it causes is more accidents
13:10 freakin Jumpscare!
Kinda weird for one of the most popular channels on YouTube to have SOOOO many continuity issues.  So...whats up with the sunroof and "rolling"?
They did infact update software and fix bugs for cars in Vietnam bruh, it's not fucking propaganda.  🥴🥴  Remember when new asian brands appeared in 80s-90s and american thought they are trash? Look what happened now? 🥴🥴 If no one go for it then who will? Stop thinking there's only "Tesla" on the market. I'm very pleased that Vinfast really pushs for it and try to sell car. Compare to other vietnamese company, it's disgusting to see our own people (who infact haven't touch a real vinfast yet in their life) try to blame and harm the brand with stupid lies. And if you want a ln affordable electric car then wait for VF 5 and VF6
I'm in Ford USA car feeling better litter bit
The bmw temperature chime scares me😂
Vin slow
As some one who is lower class but also knowledgeable about cars of the past I will say we are truly in a dark era similar to the 1970s EGR and Safety/terrible quality control era of cars. if there was a car similar to this hunk of junk it would ether be a soviet Yugo or a pinto. what really sucks about these newer generation of cars is they will be absolutely off the road in 10 to 20 years nothing is bullt to last and now with more gov regulations to try to move to electric only cars its only going to get worse. you almost don't need to be a mechanic anymore but a software engineer to work on these modern cars. I pray my 90s and early 2000s cars keep on trucken cause to have to some how come up with 50 grand or be in the hole for that amount for a modern car just for it to have mechanic bills that price in its future is so so so embarrassing. I think the future of cars should be more of a focus on hybrid/turbo internal combustion engines rather than the whole ev craze that just makes a bigger more catastrophic dent on the earth and to the poor people forced into labor to mine for it. Oh and without saying we NEED more manufacturing of automobiles and there parts done in the USA done by working class Americans who are paid handsomely for there expertise and service.
sorry vietnam, it seems to be a shitbox for 50k.
The worst car ever built…
I wouldn’t even buy a Kia and they have been around for 80 years. Why would anyone want to buy a Vietnamese car that’s been around for 5 years? This company is definitely trying to profit off of their customers by selling a Timex watch at a Rolex price.
the positive thing is that probably no one will steal it coz it will not accelerate right away.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There is a major trust issue that has been damaged by first impressions. You're playing with people's LIVES here.  If auto makers can fix problems 'over the air' with updates, you are driving a VOLATILE vehicle. Run away away from this death trap.  The End.
I stopped listening at "Vietnamese car company "
YO Vinfast people !  Workout the problems in Asia before testing in the US.   These issues should be debugged in  Vietnam, not the US !!!
fucking car !
The guy in the blue sweatshirt was just about as annoying as the amount of chimes in that piece of electric garbage.
As a vietnamese, I prove that they have  fixed
This car is like the equivalent of a virtue signaler
Its like that Albanian car from the movie "Vacation"
Vinshit chinese copy😂
You cant be You're Winner! If you're dead
James was right the owner of the company throws money at problems
Fact. the only thing that was build by Vinfast is license plate screw. all other parts was Out source by another country. sorry but its true
I’ve never seen this car before the other day, I drove to visit my parents. While pulling into town I passed one blacking an intersection totally dead. An hour later I was leaving town and it hasn’t moved an inch and the police were blocking the lane for the dude lmao.
Sunroof went drive aid 4:40
i'm vietnamese. lol, what did everyone expect. we make jeans, not electric fucking cars.
🚨 SPOILER ALERT 🚨 Revenge is a dish best served EXTREMELY COLD (payback for the war)
Shite as we say in Yorkshire England
I WAS IN NAM MAN
I would not buy noodles made in Vietnam, let alone buy their car.  No thanks!
I saw one of these the other day for the first time driving on the street shortly after seeing it in the thumbnail of this vid. My whole life, I never saw one (I would've noticed, it looks unique/different) until I saw the thumbnail of it.
This was hilarious!  The bobbing up and down and the accelerator had me crying laughing.
It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to start my new car coming from a vehicle that was 23 years old.
CAR YOY FOR MY BABY DR IT
Vinphet cars are designed and manufactured in China by Shanghai Lauch Design and Jingchaoli from A-Z and then brought to Vietnam to be assembled in Completely Knocked Down (CKD) form - like you buy a toy car and reassemble it.
Vinfast là xe việt nam nhưng linh kiện từ china
Why you guys lied about the fact about the Vinfast
screen interface looks nice i guess
I have to say, most vehicles 2010 an newer are as "idiot proof" as you can get.
I was wondering what this random dealer name popped up next to my local new car dealers, looked into it and saw it was a new company. Knew it was going to be something (not perfect)
Let’s go
The VF8 is just in its early access phase, the devs will fix the bugs with new updates along the way
Look like a renault?
This car looks like some generic rebadge for the Australian market
This is why computerized cars suck
Be glad you're not in Vietnam, if you criticise them there, the netizens go after your ass.
2/5 For Vinfast VF8 Normal car drive point to point with out problems.
Your video is such a bitter perspective since the 1st millisecond of the drive test,  big stereotype... sorry English is not my native.
13:06 YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.  I have agreed with that for like a decade!!!
Never thought I'd see a car company that makes kia/hyundai seem appealing.
My friend is a former engineer of this factory. He said that the bxss did apply immature technology in order to make money, which caused many driving problems. He said that he would only buy it after a few years until it matures.
You're looking for a start button?  You should really get in a Tesla sometime...
As a Vietnamese person that lives in vietnam i wouldnt touch anything made in vietnam .
NOLSY WITH THE FUCKIN’ COFFIN FLOP SHIRT?! 🥶😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Vietnamese Tesla made by Vietnamese Elon musk
I agree so much with the last point in the video. An EV should just be a car, but electric
Bread 🥖
Do not buy this car.  This car is hell on wheels.  Do not trust.
Vietnam is biting more than they can chew...first they need to try to design and build a good electric 2 wheeler and export that to other countries..
Bad car 👎
A homie of mine just show me a song that you were in it  Tipped me the f***  out donut pop up and down headlights 😂😂😂
you can get a 30 k high quality chinese ev that is as advanced as or more thsn teslas. keep politics out of business.
importing horrible expensive ev,s from Vietnam while banning high quality cheaper EV,s from china? politicians are beyond stupid ignorant and making things hard on American consumers is insane.
If you want to Die Fast drive a VinFast!
VF8 EV reminds me of Yugo car in the 80’s with nowadays technology. For me it’s a lemon that cannot even make a lemonade.
Bro, America is a continent, not a country
13:52 I love the old Miata ad
Tesla is the top selling EV and you don't use it in the example of cars it's up against smh.
"It's Vin-fast!" "Whaaaa?" 💀
My favorite thing about donut videos is that the ads are almost alway donut media related
Hey Americans do not downplay car companies  from developing  countries
just saw a video and this was the car JIMMY KIMMEL was driving his children and olivia rodrigo to school in
Jimmy Kimmel likes it.
you drive the new car with high techs and don't read the manual 😅😇 haha... I can't discuss about the driving quality ( it is personal taste). All other complaints: you can change if you read the car manual. Hope you can do a follow up!
who would even buy a vietnamese soup car 😂😂
how did they allow this car to pass into American market 😂😂
vinarse😂😂 this car is not even worth 20k
All the other things like jittering on highway etc are annoying, while the non responsive of pedal hardcover is kind of scary.
Why would any intelligent consumer pay 50k for this ongoing science experiment?
这是美国政府政治正确的产物，旨在去中国化，然后越南人照着美国政客的意思给美国人带去了伟大winfast，美国的朋友们好好享用！
Who the hell bought one in the first place
I think this review is fair, but we should also consider the fact that all other EV manufacturer also have issues with their very first EV. If Vinfast can improve its product, US consumer will have another option for EV.
You cant buy a vin fast in america?
As for the chimes, drive in vietnam and youll know why
Imagine a 30-year-old food distribution and real estate company suddenly decides to start making cars (and electric ones, at that). Welcome to the VinGroup's Vinfast division.  Because if this doesn't work, Vinny, err, Benny gonna forget he ever had an automotive division FAST. 🚘
I'd have to see who's leaving the negative reviews. I wouldn't take reviews from white guys seriously at all since they're just jealous that Japanese first came into the market and destroyed American car companies then Korean cars came and took so much of American consumers money lol. Now a Vietnamese car! Haha I'd never buy an American Sedan and only  some bigger vehicles. Japanese is way better
I see the Vietnamese continue the made in China motto
"Unsafe at any speed"  :(
Oh please do a follow up...
Damn. As someone who planned to never buy vinfast, now i never will loo
what a clunker.
For a company that has been Established in 2017 and Beginn producing Cars in 2018 so 1 year is crazy and the end product is decent it got its Problems Well all existing companys hast their Problems too the only thing that Holding me Back to buy this Car is the price they should have Home Info the Market with Something cheap around 10k so people could learn the Brand
The vinfast company is an automobile company originating from Vietnam. It has expanded to the United States, Europe, Asia, etc. The company itself has made many innovations, but the average car they sell is a rebadge of Chinese vehicles, such as BYD, Changan, Great Wall, etc. with a joint venture business model.
its child labor made no wonder why 😂😂
If somone has history of tickets and bad driving record this should be the car they are forced to drive for a while as drivers education lol.
I'm not a car enthusiast but what do you guys want from a car??? A car that will transform into a robot? lmao
hope the company did learn something from this, its like they speedrun producing cars.
I love Vietnamese people. Tough and headstrong. Very entrepreneurial. But while they have a lot of wrestlers and brilliant stick fighters, they have a serious shortage of engineers and scientists. Let's face it. This is a post Soviet Lada.
Thanks for be informative!!!!
When you're full of money and build a car brand out of that, it's like having a crap ton of money and developing an MMORPG for the gaming industry. I mean, at least it's not a heavy plane.
I guess there is a car worse then ford 😵‍💫😵‍💫
There was a Vinfast shop at a mall in La Jolla.  Just sitting in it, I was impressed. Felt pretty solid and comfy with lots of room.  I didn't ask about a test drive, but I wasn't offered one either.  For the price it seems like a solid car that just needs to figure things out.
If the Canadian government were a car it would be this one, can't start without a seatbelt, won't let you change lanes without a blinker, constantly tells you you're doing something wrong.
Vinfast did a SPAC stock offering that was the most transparent cash grab I have ever seen, and I watched Nikola from the start till now.
This company sponsored the Ironman World Championship yesterday. The contrast between the athleticism on display that day (multiple records set) and the sub-par product of title sponsor was laughable!
Vinfast Video 2 Lets Go
Looks like some sort of Chinese Renault
VF8 belike: you're suck at driving, get off 😂
đừng bao giờ lái chiếc xe không an toàn này,m bạn nghĩ sao khi một đất nươc ngèo nàn nhất thế giới sản xuất xe hơi? tiêu chuẩn việt nam bạn có lo lắng không. thật là liều mạng dám ngồi trên chiếc xe nay chạy trên freeway. thứ hai logo và chữ rất ngớ ngẩn, viết hẳn chũ VINFAST to đùng, xấu xí. I am Vietnamese but never dare to drive it on freeway. a products from one of the poorest countries in the world. and It MEETS VIETNAMESE STANDARD!! WOW . Not me
The real problem with EVs is there's no reason for them to exist in the first place. Like Dr Malcom opined in Jurassic Park: Dinosaurs had their shot nature selected them for extinction. Same thing happened when electric cars lost out to ICE cars 100 yrs ago..
I don’t understand the mocking them about paying you on the issue type and length?    Other car sellers in the USA had to be forced into lemon laws which are still incredibly difficult to enact in most cases. We’ve seen companies just refuse to acknowledge issues or go through lengthy court battles and offer pennies on the dollar for egregious issues (think Nissan CVT issues).   Having more consumer friendly lemon laws and regulating companies pay you like this, might actually turn the industry around.
I love how this trash Vietnamese care has apple car play but Toyota doesn’t
I think I will keep my ‘99 LeSabre with the dynaride suspension and the 3800 II V-6 engine that’s basically bulletproof 🚘
I’d say the worst think about that car is that it’s an EV!!👎
50k gets you a brand new 2023 Toyota Tacoma
thats really not ok , problems fixed with a patch/update , its not a pc game ffs
Already broke.
Vinfast will not make it. Sorry
6:12 BMW should implement this feature!!! 🤪
Keep in mind:  Vinfast is a Vietnamese company manufacturing cars.  Vietnam is a country composed of a population that primarily drives scooters and motorbikes.
It’s a nice looking car but, I would get anxiety from all the alerts.
Stop making evs weird. Just stop making them. Period.
People who say this is comparable to the Jussie situation are insane. How is this in any way like what Jussie did? Wasting taxpayer money, having people defend his bs knowing he was lying, wasting time, energy and resources that could've been spent elsewhere and so on. No, these things are not similar. What Hasan did was shitty and probably hurt the movement in certain aspects, but that's about it. Jussie did all that and way more.
Stupid tech , key in ignition problem solved .
Junk !
Communist countries have never had great record of making good cars so this should be the seam result a complicated mess
Let's be honest it's better than the yugo
I disagree about "just making a car that is electric." I love the weird quirks and stylings of EV's. It's how cars evolve.
You guys should make a video on the TATA Nexon EV and the TATA Tiago EV.
Will this be another reception ark like No Man Sky? Well we will see, but a question stays, would you drive this car or a Yugo?
I am an early vf8 buyer. In simple terms you guys are being too generous !!! In my case, it’s much worse. I have currently agreed with vinfast to buy the car back at full cost after 7 month since my experience has been nothing short of dangerous hell.   I have experienced most the issues mentioned but let me focus on the most important.. 1) mine bricks and is unable to be driven at least 1 out of 7 times. I have been stranded in oakland California in bad places and others many times putting my safety at risk. They have had to tow it from an off ramp in a bad area .. even this was a nightmare after trying to contract their number it was out of service! Yep the main number.. I  finally reached a service person since I was dealing with many other issues.., they put in a tow .. two hours later nobody had a record of it and they did another request… to this date vinfast has been unable to repair this problem. My vehicle still works except for 1 out of 7 times. Next she going into reverse there is indeed a large keeplunk that happens that did not happen in your review.. this is intermittent and has to do with if you are parked in even the slightest grade. It is bad and probably puts extreme force in the “gear” so to speak. 3) the lane keeping function which is DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!! It not only k tries to keep me in a lane but it tries to pull me into oncoming traffic and and into bike lanes .. now my only choice would normally be “turn it off” well none of these settings are saved !! Not even on the new version of the car which they have given me to test as a swap .. nope ! Nothing  saves from display choices to extreme lane correction .. this is unacceptable and in the 7 months I have had the car they have been unable to fix any of this. I have heard every excuse under the sun… these are just the worst things.. there is sooooo much more in my case … missing panel when I got the  car, seat, window issues, frame alignment issues ( not specific to mine as the loaner had it too ) Bluetooth problems of not staying connected when driving in specific areas .. the list goes on and on……  For the price, this car is terrible
another 10 more years and vinfast F8 version 3 will be amazing
Every single issue can also be solved by simply not buying an electric car.
Who would pay $50K for a piece of junk like that? I would rather take out a student loan 😅
skoda, volkswagen audi- they all prevent you from switching the lanes without blinker.
What happened to building normal cars? Why do almost all of the necessities required for a car to work must be embedded in a display in the middle of your car? How did simple inconvenience become such a problem? Why can't we stick to throttle pedal that corresponds to the engine directly, physical blinker knobs, simple safety features that work etc. Just why?
Its the hyundai of the present day, I still recall when they ( hyundai) was a nightmare  and my mechanic friend used to trade things for impossible to get parts for them..Now they are on pair with most Asian cars.
Honestly vinfast cars are probably worth $15,000-$20,000 at best.
I would never biu a car named Vinfast. The name sounds like a joke.
Fun fact: I'm eating doughnut rn😅
They really need to stop with all the technology in cars… I feel like I’m the only one that hates it.
not being able to switch lanes without the blinker seems potent5ially really dangerous, imagine a kid running into the road or smthng
I hope the Chrysler 200 3.6 convertible is on here like mine, which randomly likes to shut down while driving. Only 78,000 miles. New alternator new battery. My 2001 Nissan Sentra with 340,000 miles doesn’t even do that .
Is not bad,is very safe and good
A car should never prevent you from doing anything, any aid should be JUST an aid, not prevent you from turning it on, not prevent you from switching lanes, not prevent you from doing ANYTHING.  If someone wants to change lanes without a blinker, let them. If someone wants to drive without a seatbelt, let them. If someone wants to crash their car into a wall goin 130, fucking let them.  Its not your job to control what I do with a product.
Competition is good. It drives innovation and competitive pricing. Consumers win. I hope they blow up and are a gen player. I'm getting early Hyundai and Kia vibes from them. The answer was to offer the craziest warranty on the market and back it up. Consumers put up with it for the savings. And you figure out the bugs. Look at them now.
The NPC Car
So just like tesla but no one wanted to talk about tesla crap because it's the first electric car company.
Atleast it doesn't burn ! 😂
They couldn’t work out you press the brake pedal and put it in drive??
Blinker tap last 3 seconds .. press down off on turn - 😂
😂 ten year warranty is a full coverage on a electric car .. it’s got problems but interior is good
I would love to see if they can fix their problems. New companies have growing pains, as long as they work hard to learn from those and grow, they will do well. Would love to see if their updates actually fixed anything.
Supercar Blondie gave VinFast a glowing review. She's a shill.
I'm not sure but aren't they're platforms already out there that are proven that costs the same amount of money just a thought
Wow I can't wait to get mine i am so exxxcited !!!!
LOL you sold me I'm going to buy one right away. Paper to flagship in 5 years .WHAT COULD GO WRONG???
I didn’t trust their owner then I don’t trust their product. That’s simple. It’s scrap brand.
I owned this car for a month and returned it immediately. I am Vietnamese and wanted to support it. But it is so bad. Stay FAR Away. Better yet Run Away as fast as you can.
If you guys do this review in Vietnam, you're going to jail because you touch the patriotism of Vietnamese, lol that funny 😂😂😂  In vietnam, we do not like our that shit car.
How not to make cars.
I saw a couple of prototypes at the NYC auto show a couple of years ago.  Not bad looking, but I was left thinking "A car from Vietnam. This can't turn out well". Looks like I was right
This needs to be the only car option for anyone in Georgia or New Jersey because they dont know how to use blinkers.
Honestly theyll get troubleshooting done way faster getting them out in the market. They probably sell very few, but getting them in the hands of critics and experts outside the company can only help to find issues
Over the air updates. What's to stop a terrorist from hacking this car?
Can you review Thai brand Thairung TR transformer
Vinfast is the Yugo of the EV’s.
Bros, you guys are lucky not living Vietnam while doing this. The government will put yaa in jail if a Vietnamese is telling the truth like your bros doing now. haha
Not relying on any of these "driving assistances" would be the safest option
10:50 t he mercedes citan does exactly that, as well as several other cars with an electronic throttle
too stiff springs for the dampers is something a lot of cars suffer from since around 2010ish. Supposedly it's a "sporty" feel while actually being bad for the handling.
Attractive. When I tested the car, I did not encounter the above situation. Pretty good experience. The software has some small errors but not many. Maybe I was lucky?
Don't you want to be Beta tester for a new automotive company? Many people did for Tesla.  Is the lack of a "kind" CEO? Is the fact that it is not an American company?  To be honest, I am not willing to be a beta tester. Not only on the software side, but especially on the hardware. How is repairability? Which is something I also criticize about Tesla. Are parts readily available? Are parts standard automotive parts, and there is after-market support?
Give em another shot😂
if the vinfast vf8 is this crap i dont want to see the vinfast vf1
No way is worth 50k..  It will be like the Yugo and be out of business in a year or so
who would shoose this over ioniq 5  XDDD
I don't know how it is in the states but from Canada with the lemon law it really sounds like that after sales policy thing is to try and avoid that.
I'm glad you said absolutely. Because you guys only drove 1 car.  I bet if you drove four of them, you would have experienced more problems.
That car looks so boring I scroll down to see  that I have not subscribed to the channel after watching donut Channel for years
The car is not even worth 15k.... Is this the Yugo of the new world?
There's no way a brand-new Vietnamese car company in the U.S. should be asking as much as established brands like Hyundai and Ford for their comparable models. Good luck with that, Vinfast.
That's the future, get a good, gasoline fueled, no turbo, quality brand, manual transmisión car, before you can't anymore.
Let's give vinfast the real los Angeles test😂. Speedy get away sharp turns . Just like if it was a get away car
I would actually like to see a follow up on the vinfast but this time on a street course. Like how all the other car manufacturers test there cars out on the tracks.
Not being about to jerk the steering wheel. If I want to jerk it I should be able to jerk it.
more expensive than a mustang mach-e? who's buying it ffs
more expensive than a mustang mach-e? who's buying it ffs
" dunkin" DONUT gave free vinfast advertising .  the world is know vinfast now..thank you..
My sister Honda Accord does a similar thing but to less extreme. When switching lanes without using blinkers the steering wheel resist it but it won’t outright jerk you back into the lane. It’s easy to overpower it.
Come to Brazil and drive a Renault Kwid, I think it might change your idea
Reminds me of the movie called "Vacation" in 2015
A naturally aspirated v8 always helps with the headaches.
Like when Boeing "beta-tested" the 737 Max
The apology at the end 😂I do feel bad for whoever bought that
Almost feel like they should drive it in a college town full of bikes to replicate Vietnamese traffic conditions.
Can't imagine that someone would spend $50k for this piece of junk
Can anyone made vietsub pls
xe xăng làm dc vài năm cong bỏ làm xe điện rồi xe xăng mất giá cực nhiều
this is a good trial run not many crashes yet so far from it and they get to get input on what to do further.
yes please make follow up video thank you
This car should be priced at 20k max... who with 2 working neurons would pay 50k for that?? 😭
LoseFast !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These guys know what they're talking about and are hilarious, love them
Right into the (v)bin!  Stock price to 5 dollars
50k?? I can get a tesla cheaper than that in my country
This is the problem when a car manufacturer puts car parts together like a Lego and then thinks it'll work magic... even Lego went through a whole lot more R/D before they released each of their mechanical models. Even Japanese manufacturers didn't released Electric models at this rate
The point the car probably isn't that bad people  are whining babies that complain even small things that are probably not even legit. And probably crying because it's not even American made.
Dân Việt Nam đâu r. Nổ dữ lắm mà.
I have no "drive Aids"! I drive with protection.
invite some vf8 employe to the next video
NO MANS SKY REFERENCE ON FUCKING DONUT MEDIA????
Why do you criticize Vietnamese cars? VinFast is our pride 😊 Love from Vietnam
This is actually a Vietnam made car that is suppose to be cheaper than Tesla and is use widely in Vietnam There is actually a Grab-like company that use Vinfast as their main car
Someone get the driver a drink that’s why he’s so angry
Break that car!
All EVS are useless , this is not driving
Yes, please do a follow up.
how much did they pay you to review before the spac?
13:11 this guy looked like he aged 30 years by taking his hat off
Wow. this car is CRAP. I would never buy any asian car from a new brand. Toyota, hyundai, kia, mazda, subaru... (the OGs) build sume decent cars, but not like Vinfast, BYD, Lynk & Co... all shit cars.  The best cars are still German cars. But only with combustion engine. The German EVs are not yet mature, becuase we simply have monkeys as software developers - see VW ID models. The Audis are already better, but the infotainment is as usual for generations too complex. I drive an Audi A6 c7 (new price 2017: 87.000€ German price) with MMI navigation Plus (the top model at that time) ant the connectivity with smartphones is just a cheek. I mean, you need a CABLE for Carplay or Android Auto. The upgrade for the smartohone interface costs 350€ (i bought that). With rotary push butten switch is a horror. At least i I have the small touch field and not these 6 buttons. Bluetooth is a disaster. You get in, and you have to take 5 minutes to activate audio playback so you can listen to music from your phone. Hands-free works perfecty if you have only one phone connected (with 2 comes the MMI already to the limits although it is designed for 2 phones). If you use it with one phone and not Carplay, it works fine.
great job exposing how CRAPPY the VF8 is
Frankly, pulling onto the 110 going into downtown with a 1 second delay could kill someone. I could feel you being too nice about this car.
love you guys to ACTUALLY VERIFY MT claims
LMFAO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
VINFAST should be called VINSLOW
CO was WORTH 90B and car is a POS ! WTF
nice looking car.👍
That just what Americans need another shit car from Korea, we have enough of thier garbage cars
Lol dont you read car manual before you start driving lol specifically electric car
Does anybody remember the first Hyundai's? A company can change.
No software update is going to fix the ride quality.
A lot of these things are surprisingly tolerable, even if they're not favorable, but the lagging acceleration is more than enough that they need to blacklist this car from the market. That can legitimately kill someone.
I can’t wait to get vinfast car coming to New York city big one in the words
I think US govt agencies have become absolute corrupt. How can they let a car be on the road with this amout of safety failures? One agency should be there to review and test the code for all these driving assist software. Its matter of life and death.
Just import them and crush em, and then send em back..
Do not use or buy a Vinfast car because those VF cars are not seriously made for the sake of car manufacturing. The VF cars are marketing tool to join US stock exchanges. The cars are not for everyday uses, that is why there are numerous reports of faulty problems about VF car, which can be easily found on public media.
EVs are trash. Even the ones from the major manufacturers. Beta technology.
How about trying the VF9?
I always think of the Jaboody Dubs Megaman Dub when I hear Cyberpunk 2077. 🤣
really shows u how meaningless a stock is
Their after sale service is the most generous in the industry.  Nothing wierd about it.
I would like to note something about the startup sequence: it's dangerous. One of the things I like about a traditional turn-key-to-start is that if it's late at night or I'm actually in a dangerous situation, turning on the car and flooring it only take a couple seconds. Idgaf about a seatbelt if I've got some person with a knife after me.
VinFast ...SUCKS
You can see, the people who support this car all use very negative and uncultured words!
2 bones head guy...
The payouts for Type 1 to 3 issues make this seem like a beta test of a car
This company should be sue into bankruptcy!!!
VinCrap, my peoples don’t even want to claim this EV brand…
At $50 grand get a Honda or a Toyota. They are top of the line and you can’t go wrong! Stay away from garage names you never heard of no matter how cool the car may look.
So if you were about to hit someone in front of you, you have to turn on your turn signal on 1st?  The start up on your list should have been at least half an half.
0:38 Volkswagon? Really? It's not a "wagon" but "Wagen". E inside!
Not the worst looking car in the world. Admittedly these issues should have been dealt with pre-launch rather than using early adopters as guinnea pigs, but its good to see the owners of the business offering real cash to compensate for the issues with actual $  Other brands may have more polished and complete models but we all know how crap the after sales and customer service is even from premium marques
When I looked at the thumbnail, my first thoughts were "Oh, another Renault."
Dude, I gotta say. No Man's Sky was Sony's fault. The developer warned them it would take longer to finish the game but Sony just did not care.  -- I still think it's impressive a company has come this far, this fast, all the problems aside. But dear god, change the name. VinFast? Seriously? Yikes.
It's from Vietnam lol what do you expect
V1nsh1.t
In Vietnam, we dont even buy or drive this brand Vinfast. Its really a fraud! Its only supported by government. Nothing at all!
this car seems like complete crap. i would rather have literally any random rental sedan than this thing.
Does this mean that the owner of that car, does she get like A hundred one hundred dollar bills for all those Type Issues...?
Saw one of these things on my morning commute today. On top of all these problems, it's ugly as hell and not in an interesting way. It looks like Daihatsu built an EV in 2003.
Honestly, I might be old school on this, but I hate the modern trend of having a giant touch screen control every aspect of the car.  It seems like every new car has a gigantic touch screen which seems like such a distraction while driving
im not even a car person but i love this channel, Top Gear Teir show.
The video script is very elaborate, wasteful, dislike
Pride of Vietcong Vinfart 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
I live in Vietnam.  I would be interested to see just how hard Vinfast makes the "terms and conditions" to satisfy if any of their 135 US customers make a claim.  As for claimed vehicle sales, have a close look to see how many Vinfast cars are "sold" into other members of the VINGROUP and not into the consumer market...
Vietnam is a newly industrialised country; I can remember Malaysia with the Proton and cars made in China / India getting a bad reputation. East European cars had a bad rep in the communist era but Skoda & Dacia are popular now. Although China & Vietnam are still communist, mention "communist cars" I always think of old Skoda / Lada / Wartburg etc. I found out that very few Chinese / Vietnamese could afford cars until the 1980s.
Vietnam building a car factory in America - they were at war with them years ago...
Can't believe someone bought that
That car is a 100% a copy of the french Renault Austral 😅😅😅
Follow up!
Vinfast started as a Ramen ( yeah the noodle ) company. What could be wrong ? It is an electric car, expect stuff to be stoopid. OR expect weird, just because. Car likely chimes when other cars give an amber light in the side view mirrors. Or maybe you are getting emails! My 2019 Rav4 gives nearly the exact same ride as my 1976 VW RAbbit did...... firm, very responsive, but harsh as hell. Thsi ride review is half comedy, have a review... I get it... clicks.  I wish Toyota would PAY me for each non-essential failure, and for any delay in prompt repairs... that is something BMW, MERCEDES, Stellantis, Tesla, Honda and the rest do NOT do. This would be to cover loss of use of vehicle during repairs. 100.00/day is more than enough for a rental car.
11:50 he stalled an electric car
I know the no-turn-without-signaling is extremely dangerous but also if there was a reliable collision detection and avoidance method I would love it cause I know many drivers that could use the feature.
With VinFast, you don't buy a car. You pay into an exclusive opportunity to experience first-hand the birth of a vehicle and be compensated for it from the 4th day ownard.
This is what happens when you try to make a Tesla style car right off the bat at the start itself. Most of these EV manufacturers don't even know the basics of car/motorcycle or scooter manufacturing and jump right in by promising people crazy range , features and all at a mouth watering price in a short time (without thorough testing for a year atleast) . Thid is why i have decided that if i am compelled to buy a EV in future i will buy it from from a manufacturer who was good at making I.C.E cars and Bikes in the past rather than some Vinfast boy trying to hog the limelight in a techfest on wheels.😂😅
Ooof, sorry for the owner
Doesn't look as nice as the other EVs in the market.
so basically they do Q.A on consumer level 😂
I am Vietnamese. I love my people. But I don't support this car because this company works under Communist China. It's said it's a "made in Vietnam," but 90% of ideas and techs are "made in China." I love the people, I just can't let the commie grow!
Stock surged 400 % . Lol
VIN what??? Costing 50K? 😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😂😅😂😅😂
Uh cảm ơn những góp ý nhưng không sao cả. Ở việt nam VF đã mua toàn bộ showroom và bảo hành của GM , và xây dựng khắp nơi hệ thống bảo dưỡng và trạm sạc. Người mỹ không thích VF rồi các bạn sẽ thích nhưng ở việt nam VF hay vingroup là tiêu chuẩn cao nhất cho dịch vụ và lời hứa. Chúng tôi sẽ làm tốt hơn và 1 ngầy không xa các bạn sẽ mua xe của chúng tôi, tesla sẽ sản xuất tại nhà máy thứ 2 của chúng tôi. Bật bí cho bạn chúng tôi đang phát minh và sản xuất 1 số bộ phận của tesla đó. Bạn có thể hỏi họ. Việt nam luôn lắng nghe và phát triển. 1 ngày nào đó chúng tôi sẽ nhận được lời khuyên của bạn, nếu không cũng không tệ vì đông nam á và trung quốc vẫn là thị trường đủ lớn
Can you make a video of who is the champion of making the most money out of all those "tier compensation". Would it possible more that $50,000?
LOL, "just let you know someone behide you." When was the last time no one behide you in LA?
Buying Chinese electric car would be much better than buying the Vietnamese electric car
In case of an accident, you want to change lane quickly but forgot to turn on the blinker.  Then the car 🚙 refused to let you change lane. Let’s us pray 🙏🏻.
The fact that this company just blew up and is now the third most valuable automaker lmao.. it’s baffling.. I didn’t even know such a brand existed.. I feel stock market on EVs nowadays are too over exaggerated, I’d pick a gas powered car any day over any EV.
Um. Do people not test drive cars? Who would buy this after driving for even a few minutes?
No all-electric vehicle can beat Tesla
Fair review!
Vin nô đâu hết rồi ạ?
Basically Vinfast made their first buyers their test subjects?
Nice review! Cool content! Subscribed Guys, have You made review for Chevrolet Spark?
Chimes check box is blank here but the before and after clip has it shaded...
Thank you donuts for advertising for Vinfast. 90 usd oh my god.
Please do Fisker Ocean!
Vin fast now has a market cap more than ford gm and Chrysler combined that is so ridiculous insane. It’s market cap is higher than Toyota!
It’s the Nissan Altima of EVs
Well, I do think it's cool Viet Nam is making a car now.  Not a foreign company making cars IN Viet Nam but an actual Vietnamese company.  I hope they work it all out.
I think if you try to change lanes without using your blinker, the car should explode
The blinker thing would have caused a massive class action suit.  Fortunately for the company, not enough people bought the car to build a class action suit.
Хорошие видосы получаются, спасибо!
If I'm spending 50k, I'm buying a ZL1, a GT350, or if the market is right a GTR. The Vinfast is more like a 30k-40k car, if I was looking for an EV.
As a Vietnamese i can confirm this is true
I love how they put the Amazon 1 star thing  like it’s sold on Amazon
Great review Donut boys!
So a deer jumps in the road…..& you have to put your signal on before attempting to dodge it? Lmao Insanity
Software as a service in car form
So the next follow up video should be called VinFixed? 🤣🤣
Tesla cars are perfect and never needed any recalls or firmware upgrades.  They never catch on fire either.
Love the No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk analogies.  Hope this manufacturer can turn it around.
Vinfast? more like vinslow
What happened to Up to Speed
That was not an unusual startup procedure
Do it again for VinFast.  Yea.
ECSP  Extra Careful Software Policy's
You lost me at "electric SUV." 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Is there an option for 'doors falling off'? If there is it would be ideally suited as a ring car for the clowns at the circus; otherwise just recycle all of them into washing machines.
Please Do Spyker C8 & THINK City 👌
I triee to cancel my reservation,  no luck
And if they are rushing and cutting to sell their shit car quick, there is no way of knowing what else. Plus 50k.. You gotta be fuckin kidding me 😂
Thanks for review.  Was gonna get this one. Sounds like it has much problems. Starting take that long? isn't gonna cut it for me hauling my toddler. Sounds like a stupid car still needs a lot of bugs.
Sorry folks, Vietnam doesn’t have any R&D, nor material production nor car part production. You guess where Vinfast’s parts come from! It’s a collection of Chinese parts. Don’t waste your $50k. Get a Japanese, German or American car!
So basically the Cyberpunk 2077 car: Released really shit, got review bombed, got a bad fame and will be fixed afterwards (and probably end up an actually decent product, but still with the bad fame)
This car is a wannabe tesla
I think the stock price will go up after this review 😂
Modern American suburban soccer mom: "yea we just got it and we love it."
I didn't even know a car could be this bad.
Outside of big shopping malls, every thing else guy makes are shit
Electric cars are poisonous to manufacture, dangerous to crash and rarely worth the expense - except to VIRTUE SIGNAL how "great YOU are" .  This one seems near the BOTTOM of the heap!
❤ if you want to get rich then just short the stock of vinfast and watch that bank account go boom 💥
Its seems like TOGG.
I think the thing with blinker might be because of how the Vinfast is initially design to fit with VietNam street. In VietNam the street is filled with motorbikes that's why it would be safer if the driver turn on the blinker. And because the road in VietNam is narrow and not many people drive fast like in the US so the street is profoundly more safe on the highway. I believe another component also should be taking into consideration is that probably because VF already having 8 model with good rating in VietNam make them overestimate their  potential in the US. Overall I would say Vinfast was really in a rush with this debut the only impressive thing is how fast their stock price raise.
Follow-up is needed.
Give them another chance
This car can make Americans feel great again because it is an alternative of made in China. It is a political EV car for voters who hate China. LOL 😂 😂
5:06 limited VB WRX
Why would you buy this piece of crap if you cant move youe steering wheel without blinkers?? Terribly designed.
Love the sound design.
Chunkiplier seems like a nice guy.
8:45 My only issue is a personal one I’ve been wanting to test at some point but maybe y’all can consider us to quantitatively prove this. My theory having read car reviews since the late 90s pre digital publications is reviewers HAVE to review something combined with elevated expectations that may not be in line with a proper benchmark when the price is moderately high. So if we’re talking spring tension, ESPECIALLY on the 405 during construction, is this actually true to a quantitative level meeting a statistical  significance? I honestly am not so sure. Bc if so , how much so? Otherwise, it’s a pretty damning thing a company would have to overcome if every car experiences a similar ride experience on damaged road. Humans are incredibly susceptible to confirmation bias and suggestion. One of the only things I still use from my overpriced graduate school is my degree in consumer behavior. And this is one area that the review process might want to consider more.  Also I’m sure something on your radar already is longitudinal reviews. I haven’t gotten past the original time stamp yet but I’m sure you’ll be fair and get a statement from the  company   And it’ll likely address updates of some kind which is the right answer. But is it true? I’m honestly not as concerned with issues on my vehicle as much as I would be if a company was hyper aware and intentional about correcting those mistakes. I’d value that very high and would factor into my purchase decision is a meaningful way. Just food for thought. Massive fan of this type of content y’all are crushing it
Vietnam 😂
Can’t call this shit a car 💀 and I don’t buy it even though I am Vnese
Good stuff. Yes, do it again. Next time go deeper: range, battery size, 0-60 time, HP, Autopilot and more indepth comparision to other EVs on the market, including Tesla.
The OTA updates for the software is great but I don’t think a patch is going to fix the suspension issues 😂
How is this car not banned on safety grounds?
$ 50k for a headache? Then they going to give you patience for their tiered issues.
You guys definitely needa do a review on the lucid EV lineup , Especially the Tesla Killing Lucid Sapphire , which sounds exotic like a frickin killer Pokémon
Well kia and hyundia sucked when they first came out so give em a brake
Hey, ya have to at least give these guys a half a thumbs up for producing an EV from Vietnam.
so we're all gonna ignore that a maybach passed them at 8:22
Not sure if I’d buy a car from somewhere where 90% of the population doesn’t drive a car. I’m sure they’d make a a great moped though.
I'm a German living in Hai Phong Vietnam where the Vinfast company and prodution is located. Even here you don't see so many Vinfast vehicles compare to Germany and a VW. I met with a lot of engineers from different countries setting up the plant and the production line regularly in our comon pup. Ones I asked them: would you buy one of it? The answer was NO. Their issue was as well the fast track. Now in 2022/23 Vinfast is replacing those experts from Germany, Brazil, Poland, UK, etc. with engineers from India since they are cheaper.
Oof no way could I drive that
That car is 💩
china made disguised ad vietnamese made ! scammers !
In any case, you can say that the engineers are very consistent: nothing works.
0:39 Dude don't even know how to write "Volkswagen"
What I do not understand - why is it legal to sell those cars in the US? In Europe, this car would not pass ANY approval to be used due to obvious flaws.
It is built for OJ
when the optimistic side is comparing a vehicle to cbpk or no man’s sky, you know it really should NOT have been released lmfao 💀
Amazing that you can have a billionaire in a country that claim all citizen share everything.
That delay in acceleration can become a big deal to try avoid an accident combined with the can't change lanes without a blinker can be a really big safety issue
This is one of the best car channels on YouTube. Thanks for all the honesty and humor. I also like the positive attitude you have and the criticisms you do are legitimate.✌️
Pricy!! And Hot Garbage? Win!!!
I hate smart cars. Cars dont need any technology besides maybe a camera and GPS.
I would like to know if there is a manual mode, so that doesn’t have all the extra things. Can we just drive it like a car?  Maybe a way to override drive assist, or even specify which chimes you hear
cars dependant of software, what could go wrong...
Metal coffin
I rented a car about a month ago it was a Volvo and it had the lane control thing too. If I didnt signal, the car would like fight me when changing lanes. Its a cool feature tbh
As just a regular  Vietnamese who probadly have NO money to buy this car ever! I think Vinfast need so much more adjust to actually fit the safety level, but still a bit glad that Vietnamese actually have a car brand that can reach out there!
Please try esemka cars
Tree camo is activated when the car sees an American car in groups,  it shall hide in the greenary and slow attack and bring more and more soldiers to the battle
you guy used to make fun of asian car in the past ( japan, korea))) look at them now,,, and what is happened to american car?... junk,,, right?..
LOL. "Vinfast Auto Ltd. shares skyrocketed 109% to add $44 billion in market value to the Vietnamese electric vehicle maker on Tuesday, extending a raucous week since it went public." You can't fix crappy ride due to springs with a software update.
THE WAY THOSEE GUY TEST DRIVE  LOOK LIKE THEY WANT MESS UP THE CAR AND DESTROY  THE CAR ..WATCH THE WAY THEY ACTING   IN THE VIDEO...
It's a dumpster fire but I kinda like the start up
It’s like getting a car from Temu
I'm from Canada and I drove one at the CNE (Canadian national exhibition) and I was impressed by its acceleration in sport mode, I thought it was a good looking car as well.
F u donut you guys dont even have enough experience ev car 😅😅😅😅
You guys should thank that car for not burned you alive with it, here in vietnam we have to proud of this thing in order to be a patriotic citizen
Will Hunting was right!
Iam việt nam
Usually even after updates the fate of a product has been marred by its first impression. However, an updated review would be great
The worst car in America can’t be worst than the 1985 ford ranger I drive
I want to see a $10k EV that has no gimmicks or pointless conveniences. Just a reliable, okay ride with a little ground clearance for snow and enough battery for commuters; otherwise, the bare minimum to legally be on the road.
more like Vinslow...
So we have cars like NIO that is not in the states and is far more developed far beyond VinFast and they're out here selling BETA cars? wtf
TERRIBLE CAR,,,, SERVED IN VIETNAM WAR,,, LATE 60s EARLY 70s,,, KEEP THESE COMMUNIST CARS OUT OF THE USA.
Даа, прикольненько
You mean this is not a press loaner? You mean somebody actually used her own money to inflict this car on herself?? smh!
04:17 the thing about things re=setting when you leave the car mention in the written review is something I experienced to my lasting annoyance. What's the point of adjusting a dozen things to your preference, only to have everything return to the default setting the next time you start the car?? After a while, I just got tired of it, and learned to live with the factory default. Screw it !!  I wonder if this is the case with many of today's vehicles, or if my Saab was unique in that regard.
Yeah, uh, nope.
shit, for that amount of money I'd rather get a regular gas car that will work
These are everywhere in Vietnam
I like all vehicles NOT made with Ford, GM,  or Dodge/Chrysler emblems.
I don‘t think I want this car brand come to germany… and I don‘t think I ever want to encounter a car like that when I‘m outside. 🤨 I already don‘t trust driving assistants.
Vinfast's Mother company in Shanghai issued a statement today that says it has set aside 65 billion USD to increase Vinfast's capital and it aims to make Vinfast the largest electric company in the world. Vinfast will start shipping Vinfast cars of all models from the port of Haiphong, Vietnam, to China. The first shipment is said to be around 20,000 units. China's annual consumption of vehicles of all types runs in the order of 20 million units. Vinfast aims to gain a market share of at least 10% of that total. Vinfast stock jumped 150% to 46.98 at one point earlier this morning on the Nasdaq Exchange in New York.
i am a vietnamese and i give you an advise, do not buy this junk car, you will wast you hard working money.
Another get rich quick scheme like Mullen Automotive 😅
In Vietnam, if you give the real negative opinions you would get sued by vinfast themselves!
Lodge a warranty claim if you dare. This guy disappeared 😅 May 4, 2021.HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese car maker VinFast has reported one of its customers to the police over comments he made on YouTube about the quality of his car.
This company will never last. Stupid name too!! EV’s suck!!
>"""smart""" cars Imagine needing a software patch for your car.
and people in vietnam claiming this shitbox can replace tesla 💀 arrogant mfs
Some criticism for your video: please do not compare a car to a video game that released with problems. A faulty car can claim a lot of lives, while video games cannot do that. Let's try to avoid having the same standard.
It's a new car company. What do you expect?? Look at where Hyundai was in the early 90's... or even better... how many problems Ford and Gm had when they first came out. The fact the car can even make it down the road is pretty impressive. Don't get me wrong, I'd never buy one of these piles of shit,  but you gotta understand that EVERY car manufacturer goes through this for at least half a decade or so
What about the "ROLLING"?
surely the "CHIMES"...sound warning can be turned off...why are you not turning them off so i doesn't give you the sound ...only the light blinking inside your side mirrors ....
🇻🇳VINFAST is very modern, gorgeous, quality, trendy💕.!
The chimes are easily fixable with an update.
I like how they compared 😂
50k? LOL wtf.   I thought it was a 20k car or less.
Latest news from Shanghai, China: Vinfast is a Chinese Company established by Chinese, funded by Chinese, owned by Chines 100%. All Vinfast cars are made by and shipped from China in CKD forms (Complete Knocked Down) and assembled in Vietnam
They didnt release it too early. They just made it too goddamn complicated.
All Asian vehicles are garbage outside of Japan. Even KIAs suck.  Quit buying rice mobiles.
It’s like if you bought a car from temu
Maybe they're still pissed off about the war.
Muricons. They expect chimes. To feel good. It’s probably not detecting passing cars at 5:35 cause you were stopped.  Changing lanes at 6:15 why shouldn’t your indicate first. You are not the only person on the road. The rest of the world indicates to changes a lane. It called lane discipline. Get used to it
You can switch lanes without blinkers if you steer hard enough
I've had  "quirky" cars before.Two handed down Peugeots,three Saabs.Both were the kind of quirky that goes over some people's heads.But if you look at them objectively thooe oddties made sense.And,all were super reliable and nearly indestructible.I just wish Peugeots and Saabs were still available in the US.Not so sure about this Vinfast,though.
I'm pretty sure the brakes are also lemony
That's rubbish compared with any China EV.
They are communist scam.  They buy parts from China and assemble them in US to scam tax, credit and stocks.
They don't try to sell car in US, they want to public their stocks and scam the money from stock.
In Vietnam, Vinfast has police intimidate people who gave bad reviews framing them as anti Government.
Blud think hes Tesla
Побольше таких видео, хотя от куда взять столько времени
Skoda Scala does the same thing with lane assist doesnt let me change lane if i dont turn signals and it wobbles between lanes :( bad tech
12 years ago. Since 12 years ago, Tesla had cars where you get in, your fob is in your pocket, you put foot on brake, it starts and you drive.  Where are these people from that for over a decade this is a surprise?
Vinfast . I was initially very interested in this car. The weird battery subscription on top of their high price made me do a re think. I am now glad I walked.
Im literally kinda shocked this wasnt a jeep
This has to be some kind of money laundering scheme. I cannot understand the pricing strategy on these cars.
We need to give the car another shot I think if they said they fixed some of the problems.
The worse part is when it crash
This looks identical to the new Renaults we have in the uk or the new mg’s
So Vietnam are selling a substandard product to America for 5 times what it's actually worth. That's just rubbing salt into the wound.
Vinfast with only 15,000 EV sales in last 7mths, is now worth more than GM and Ford, ranked 3rd most valuable EV just behind Tesla and BYD, almost equal to BYD value that sell millions of top quality EV.
"the car constantly chimes with warnings while driving" The car has anxiety
The problem with the auto makers is that they’re trying to pull a back to  The future and make futuristic cars if you want to make a reliable car that just works and doesn’t cost 50k it should be actually cheap not 45k not 50k hell not even 30k it should start in the teens like $15,000 for that you get a car that works nonsense like tablet screens just a simple gage the tells you everything you need when driving information as speed how much battery you have left temperatures of outside and of the battery the rest will be like a normal car with a radio ac heat etc if you want higher features the car would go up to 25,000 or a little bit less
A shitty car
This car should be forbidden for sale !
It IS good looking though   ...for what THAT's worth.
Imagine literally having to "UPDATE" your car before going on a trip 💀
I only watch car shows on Corncob TV.
If no european has heard of your car, its likely not a very good car. If europeans know about the car, it means it has evolved from being a project to an actual car.
Trash car 😂
That start up was pathetic.  I have an EV and that's exactly what I expected the start up to be. Get in, put on your seatbelt, brake and drive. I'm pretty sure it would have taken most EV drivers around 15 seconds to figure it out.
Most of these things are seemed to be can be fixed by software updates. So a follow up video would be great
I hate when companies make consumers their beta testers! In this case it can be downright dangerous!
The chimes and lane indicators remind me of a cheap Nissan SUV we just rented. The ride quality and noise were similarly bad.
Car chimes in cars of any sort drive me to the point of wanting to track them down and rip them out with my teeth and dumping them at the dealers front door.
I honestly expected this car to be sub 20k, 50k? Get outta here
Lets talk about the STYLING.....🤭
So it's worse than Jeep?
This is disturbing that it’s on the road. Who got paid ?
Wait a minute...If I find 500 separate Type 1 issues, then my Vinfast is pretty much paid off? 🤔
I appreciate the fair and reasonable approach of the review.  I agree that they rushed this one out. It looks like they really want to get a piece of the pie before the EV market becomes oversaturated.  Vinfast motto: "It's ok, we'll fix it later."
ye good vid
You have all complained about being made in China, but do you know made in Vietnam?
6:10 This functionality should be in all BMW cars without the option to disable it. xD You don't want to use blinkers? WE WILL FORCE YOU! xD
We hired a Peugeot while on holiday and sat in their driveway trying to figure out how to work it. It was an ICE car but there were so many little tricks to just starting it and driving forward. Either that or my wife shouldn't drive. Hmmm
You can surely turn off the chimes and they stay off unless toggled in future?
Where do you get those cool cartoony toy cars that's on the table?😅 Time: 03:00 into the video
As of today VinFast is worth $86B, more than Ford and GM LOL!
"Vin" not so "fast" ironically.
offering $100 usd/day to consumers in america is an absolute laugh and outright insulting. just like mc donald's flopped in vn from a lack of market understanding, they're following in their footsteps. incredible that a company that has billions of dollars can't be arsed to hire a few consultants to advise them on this basic, day-one stuff.
this is the result of vietnamese management, engineers, manufacturing, and quality control. everything produced from that country is similar to this (vinfast is doing much better than most, some truly atrocious stuff comes from there).  they could have consulted with foreign experts, but that's just "too much mun-ee" and "too much time" and "no bod-ee care, just get down price". kia became a success even though they initially sucked, but their cars were cheap as chips.  vinfast is charging top dollar for rubbish, aren't profitable, and infuriating the fickle western consumer. could be a bud light story, we'll see.
Nothing that comes from a communist country will ever compete with America. Only reason that dude is worth "4B" is because of government corruption.
stocks for this vheicle skyrocket this week
I'm Vietnamese and I laughed at all of my friends when they asked if I was going to lease this vehicle.  Growing up I was always told to never question what meat was in the food, why is there always a loose hair in the food.  We also never bought anything Made in Vietnam except for their food (ironic right?).  Their response is the typical "What you want, what you want?  I give you $5 go away" mentality.
I suspect a lot of the issues are from abysmal quality control in the factory rather than an inherently bad design, but that certainly can't be ruled out either...
Videos like this bring attention to the issues, if a company is smart enough to fix the problems they could end up with success
Hahahahahah you guys damn getting paid from Tesla? F u
The only way to give them a fair shake is to re-re-eval the vf8.
😂😂
It's just not that attractive compared to other ev
As you said the car was released to early without being tested accordingly. VF reminds me how Hyundai introduced itself to the US market back on the 80’s with so much issues as the years went bye , Hyundai is refined and have good cars that compete with other cars within its car type category. Impressive N models , SUVs and EV/Hybrid cars. VF seems to rely on tech developed by other EV companies, using that to push their product in the market, I hope it’ll not be a Frisker Karma like flop.  Also for $50K I ain’t gonna buy one, I am gonna buy a petrol/gas powered vehicle and use it till their be no gas in the earth.  I will always pick a combustion engine over a EV.. I want to hear the engine and be the one to decide when and where I can buy my own gas, without worrying how far the car will take me… I almost forgot I do like cars that are fuel operated with actual shifting transmission automatic or manual.  All that cVt transmission crap is a huge NO for me.. I want a car that’s a car not one that operates like a snowmobile or EV…
I remember my parents 1976 Subaru station wagon… I now drive a 2010 Outback, premium edition… Yea, there are flaws and weaknesses, but if a manufacturer is providing extra services, to help consumers improve their personal experience, after purchase, it means they are going to put that customer’s experience into future developments… Sounds like many of the things you’re complaining about are “not what you’re used to,” rather than “is this going to get me to and from, safely.” Roads and driving habits are different, in Vietnam. I like to point out, that you boys are big. Those cars were made by ppl a foot shorter, and 2/3 your weight. If the car was designated to carry 300 lbs, and you put 500 lbs in it, you’re gonna have issues. If you change components, to handle the extra weight, required for the American market, that will probably go away…  What I’m getting, from your story has me excited. It sounds like a company that wants to work with customers, to have an enjoyable experience with their product, and begging for feedback. That commitment to customers is what made Subaru such a great car. Hopefully they continue a path, that leads to customers being able to easily upgrade and modify their vehicles, to fit our personal needs… 🤞
Wow that car over riding changing lane with no signal on is so dangerous, what if you need to suddenly swerve last minute to avoid something in the road, and the car does not let you.
How good video was? i give rating 3/10
This car is a high tech Yugo, and while it might not be Yugo level bad, the Yugo was the cheapest production car available when it come out, I think it was around 4 or 5 grand in the mid 80's.
This is pure luxury by Vietnamese standards. And holy crap! Not being able to switch lanes without the turn signals being activated? That sounds so incredibly dangerous. I have had to make emergency lane changes to avoid collisions. Why did NHTSA allow this to be sold here?
Last time I hired a contractor to work on my yard he accidentally broke a irrigation pipe. The Vietnamese gentleman covered it back up and tried to convince me that I would never use it again in my life. I've been to Vietnam and I am comfortable using most products made there, but cars? No thank you.
You sure you don't want to just make another episode about how great a totally 'mid' car from 20 years ago is, thus tripling the price overnight? Did you run out of average old cars to ruin for everyone?
Hey, what about that sunroof? 🤔
Your videos are so funny I love
Make a car for those that enjoy gadgets and gadgets. Then also make a vehicle for those that just want to get from point A to point B securely and safely. No need for a bunch of useless gadgets to break down.
They should bring out a “Bud Light” version.
Acceleration lag reminds me of the 1st Gen Chevy Volt, except that delay is only from a complete stop.
Even if the car works, I don’t think it’s worth 50k, you could find a better more comfortable car for cheaper
Who is buying this thing 😂 Based on the design, the built quality and the software, it may has a market if the price is lower down to 25000😅
Now I want Forrest to review this
We know internet-stock wealth is like ocean waves. It can be sky high, then down low and gone. We have multi-billionaires like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, Sam Bankman Fried of FTX, they were worth billions and billions but now sitting in jail. Now we have Pham Nhat Vuong, worth 50 billion, of Vinfast Auto, from Vietnam.  Vinfast sold a total of some 19,000 electric cars, about half to VinTaxi owned by the mother company VinGroup. In early 2023 Vinfast also shipped 1000 to the US but were told to ship back to Vietnam since they failed to meet US safety standards. Vinfast never made a red cent, they lost maybe 5 billions in the 4 years since they entered the auto business in 2019. All of that happened in Vietnam.  Somehow Vinfast managed to get themselves listed on Nasdaq and started trading 3 days go. Vinfast was worth less than a cent last week, now Vinfast is worth 50 billion USD. How is that for internet wealth? Anybody in the US looking at this company? How is that possible? Even in this crazy world of internet money.
They put this car in a shopping center in rotterdam, no one cared and when i saw it in person (regardless of the brand/logo) for some reason it felt cheap and looked like a toy
And this brand is now valued more than vw and bmw😂
Comparing it to No Man’s Sky and Cyberpunk 2077 😂
One of Vietnam’s biggest automakers has made a big splash on its entry to Wall Street, pushing its market capitalization above that of industry giants such as Volkswagen and Ford.  VinFast, an electric vehicle maker, enjoyed a red-hot debut in New York on Tuesday after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Black Spade Acquisition Co.
Its difficult to engineer the dumb out of the average person... its also difficult to get the dumb out of engineers 😂
Soft. I got a headache while driving c'mon gentlemen get it together
I'm rooting for this company tbh. I hope things get better for them
The fact that it blocks you from changing lanes without the blinker is so dangerous. I've had plenty of situations where I needed to avoid some obstacle on very short notice (pot holes, animals, debris, even other cars etc.) the car might not see, and had to go over the line slightly. This car would just push me back into them
I trust Car Review Magazines as far as I can throw them, bastards cost us the Jimny in the US.
It's more expensive than a Tesla Model 3 Long Range 😄
Vietnam doesn’t have long history of manufacturing cars. They need to give more effore because China also doesn’t have long history but making decent EV nowadaysz
Top 10. 2 meilleurs clowns Ocar américain
There are a lot of upscale EV's emerging, but they are too expensive for the masses. I see a big need for simple EV's that have a driving experience similar to a 2000 Corolla or a 2004 Civic SI hatch. Walk up, key fob recognition unlocks door & enables drive mode, enter car, put on seat belt, apply brake, select gear, & drive away. No lane control, no steering wheel shaking, no automatic braking, yes to backup camera, and yes to blind spot warning. Certainly, offer options in power, battery capacity, trim level, connectivity and infotainment. Keep them light, like 2,500-3,000LBS tops. Sell millions.
VIN to fast released lol lol
Never trust a Vietnamese product. 🤣🤣
Moose 🫎 test is out of the question with this car🙋‍♂️
$50K US?! I wouldn't buy one even if it's buy one get one free!
And it's fkn ugly to boot.
10:46 In an electric car I can see how that's less acceptable, but my 2014 ford escape has accelerator lag like that too (I can floor it like y'all did in the video and it wont react at all lol) Which is reasonable seeing as it's not an EV (plus in sport mode it's better)
The Tesla mentality of "So what if it barely works and catches on fire for 38 hours, has to be recharged 14 hours after a long drive, tries to hit pedestrians, look at my shiny sales pitch!" is still in full effect...?
It’s made in Vietnam. What do you expect?   If it was a bowl of noodles, it would be OK.
Brand took me off-guard... Vinfast "For family"
Well building EVs seems to be a reasonable way of laundering money😇
I will not own a new car,not even if paid to do it. I despise the electronic push button garbage
They might be on to something if it was $15 grand.
How does a car like this get street legal/approved in the US?
Wow that’s AWFUL. If it was £15-20k that’s like yeah, fair enough. But £50K🥴. That’s Mercedes A45S or used s63, M5 or RS6 money. Unreal🤯
It’s a nice looking car I hate how they ruined it
You are spending far too much time looking at the road! KEEP your eyes on that screen. Remember road attention bad, distraction GOOD. Stupid cars.
This matured well. IPOs out today, stocks up 500% in a day
My 2004 Chevy trailblazer with 250,00 miles, slightly off center steering wheel, and 0-60 of 4min is better than that car
I love this car.
Jesus loves you God bless
I want a compact electric vehicle with a high safety rating designed specifically for running errands around town and not long distance travel.   I would have looked into the electric bikes but the drivers in my area are actually psychotic
Just buy a Telsa Model Y or X.
You forgot about the pt cruiser
EV maker VinFast's shares surge in Nasdaq debut. Is the world crazy?
never buy a first Generation car, you are buying a "proto type", All the failures will be fixed in the 2nd Generation
Looks like the electric Renault Megane
It is good looking along the lines of the higher-end Citreon models.  That said, it is built by a Communist Country controlled by China.
Cyberpunk spent like 10yrs in production... And yet it was rushed? LoL
Regarding the start up, that not unique to them. I rented a polestar 2 a couple weeks ago, same thing. It's like a gold cart, you hop in with the key, and throw it in drive or reverse.
I will dislike its because I'm Vietnamese This car company is the pride of my country
give them one more chance. see if anything has changed.
LOVE LOVE LOVE my Borla Exhaust!!
Our office in Los Angeles did try to use Vinfast as our corporate vehicles.  And after a lengthy test, we dropped it and went for other brand instead.  The reason was NOT due to reliability issues alone, but it was due to safety reasons.  Enough said...
No thanks. I'll stick to my 2 '72 Plymouth Fury's
“On the fourth day of Christmas Vinfast have to me…”
I loved how the poor cameraman on the seats behind had to use his hardware to stand the checklist on a board.
Henry is literally how I imagine Quentin Tarantino at his 30s.
Seems like you guys are being d***s just for the sake of it. Wonder if you are this negative about US made cars like Tesla?? How is this guy complaining so much about starting it up, its exactly the same as other cars (including Tesla) and intuitive - you literally just press the brake pedal and put it in drive! What else do you want? On the driver aids, Tesla will also tug you back into your lane if you don't have your blinkers on - can turn it off in settings though and probably the same with this car which obviously you didn't bother to check. Turning radius - again Tesla is crap at this. Ride quality - did you bother comparing it to other cars on the same stretch of road? "Nothing works in this car" - who's paying you to say that? Seems like these donuts should've eaten a couple of donuts before doing this review - especially the one in the lilac shirt who was clearly just hangry. Also its quite refreshing that VF is publicly admitting there's something wrong and offering cash compensation - not seen any other car manufacturer do that unless its mandated by the government. FYI I own a Tesla Model 3P and absolutely love it - but I have the ability to be objective. I'm sure some complaints are justified but at least try to be somewhat objective. Strong suspicion that US media is being paid to s*** on foreign made cars for the sake of it...
10:49 when your car has an input delay.
I remember this car, People say that this is from vietnam.
VF for very fucked-up
They seem like they'll make something good within the decade.  But it doesn't look like they'll make anything good and affordable.
luckily this monstrosity is not sold in Australia  Thank  God
50k can get you a Tesla….they can’t possibly price it there and expect to sell any
You guys in the US are reeeeally lucky not to have chinese cars in the streets. In Chile we have like 50 different brands and most of them produce cars that are simply a waste of money (although they’ve been improving since they fist arrived to the country). Now THAT kind of cars make you car sick.
is there  vin slow? LOLs.
So it's not just me, the turning radius in most cars IS getting worse?
“Vietnamese”
Tesla gives you $100 uber credit per day serviced. whatever.
do the next video
You gave it a fair shake already, but it would be interesting to see a follow-up.
we would love a follow up
They still make that timer? or is it old, I had one in the late 80's.
No no no, you don't understand, this company is a extension of the comunist party in Vietnam, everything said and done by this company were underline back up, in fact, in vietnam, a car reviewer and some random ass customer said something problem that continuously pop up after multiple repair under warranty period, publicly shaming this car company shady practice, actually got arrested and charged with "spreading false information" and "deflamation claim that negative effect reputation of this company". They lie in pretty much all aspect of the car, the electronic system of the car are 80% from china, faulty equipment and battery issues with EV car of this company happen even in test drive . In some case, EV car and some other car of this company caught fire and burn itself. THIS CAR IS A SCAM, THIS COMPANY SHADY PRACTICE AND CULTURE CAN NOT BE TRUSTED, DON'T EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY.
Most of these issues should have been solved before the car rolled out of the factory as they are safety concerns. Ridiculous. Also, I’m sure on their policy where they will start paying individuals on the fourth day of having their cars in the shop, they will just kick those cars out without the problem fixed. No company wants to bleed money and it will technically just reset the clock if the customer brings the car back later.
Do an update of this video
Props for the No mans sky comparison 😅
If the vax were a car. 😂
Who the hell buys a Vinfast over a VW or a Mustang ? ..AND the stand and VW are cheaper
I would not anything to do with this shi* box!
No no no…..cars unlike games put people in real danger and bugs are unacceptable at launch. DO NOT LET IT BECOME INDUSTRY STANDARD!
6:11 this is actually dope u should add that to BMWS AND RAMS 💀💀💀
Cars aren’t video games, these safety system issues should cause a vehicle recall. Not just patch notes and updates
What if you were trying to swerve to avoid a collision but didn't turn your blinker on?
...Then the car chimes to let you know your killer is on the left
I bet Jane Fonda drives one.
Nah try a chevy cruze cuz
50K? 😂
The over-editing of this video made me nauseas.
Toyota Yaris also does that auto steering when you change lane without indicating!
The VW ID4 is $12,000 less. I think i know which one i'd go for.
Provably why they're not allowed in the UK.
i just played the donut accolades in forza 5 nd i just find out donut is a real thing
MADE IN CHINA
Made in China
Vinfast The sequel : Vin2fast 💀
It's pretty much as the first Tesla's on the market (the Musk era Tesla's) they where terrible with many electric issues that took long time for updates to finally fix it.
😂😂😂😂
Hey guys try to get the vinfast vf3. It looks brillant
if the globalists get to make a car it will be worse.
it has the looks, now they need the tech to work properly and lose some money helping the current customers and it's an easy sell ... feels more like a QC issue in the end due to the rushed timeframe
it's only software related. I care about core values ​​it's too beautiful. Remember that the iPhone on the new launch day also has a lot of errors
Vietnamese number one
ive never  seen a Vinfast on the road. Only in malls
Can't wait to see the follow up. Thanks!
Let’s see the car review after the software update
Software problems. VF8 has beautiful  design.
No way the ioniq 5 is almost 50k wtff
In other words it's as bad as a tesla!   LOL
So sad for you guys have to try this awful car!
Thank god you guys didn't sold out on this review by praising the car lol.
you lost me on the start up, I dont need to watch a video reviewing a pile of nonsense
its not acceptable to update a car like its Fortnite. If they are charging more than known competitors they have to have superior quality.
What do you think Lance? 40 weight? 50 weight?
It looked like you changed the "Blinkers" to a fail. I agree with that. I think I missed "Rolling"?
Anyone who reaches the decision to buy one of these over the other options on the market deserve not only all of these issues to happen but also for the car to fall apart into a pile of plastic upon pulling out of the dealership.
Why blur the plate?
wait the mach-e is only 46k in america?
More than a Tesla and shorter range??
i laughed out loud when they compared this car to no mans sky and cyberpunk😂😂 that caught me so off guard😂 the strangest thing to compare it to
Yet the liberals in government continues to mandate electrical vehicles to line their pockets
If this is just another CHINESE re-badged EV sold by a Vietnamese Business then no amount of Software patch is going to compensate for that.
Get a Toyota and problem solved.
When I heard Vietnamese I’m like that car most likely has wish parts and the cheapest components known to man and maximize profits 😂
DEATH  GOT ME🤣🤣 DEATH   BATTERY🤣🤣
Calling this a turd on wheels would be too kind for this car.
Who would pay $50k for a Volkswagon?
Haha I'm really asking how much money did the guys give you to smear this car :))
8:03 please don't mention road noise, we don't need any more of those dreaded carpeted wheel-well liners.. or carpet anywhere outside of the car for that matter..(heck, even inside, that 💩 get so nasty so fast and is such a pain to clean, and for essentially no benefit >.>)
Try Wuling Brand
Why in the 90s and 2000s there was never any new car companies but now it’s all these new all electric car companies. Why no new car companies that make gas cars in the last 30 years
I can't tell one car from another these days. Most of them look like a giant shoe.
Not bad for a poor country ngl
Dirty chanel
Wow a full second delay for acceleration is crazy
lol is you guys say uts the worst    that means is actually a great car.
Pov if the vf8 was a police car: "Hes right and front of us and he has a 1960 semi truck we can catch him! Wait, how is he getting away WHY IS THE CAR NOT ACCELERATING!?"
James, with your hat off you look like the product of a one night stand between Matt from Matts off road recovery and Don Shipley. Thats a compliment btw.
But does it get you  from  A  to  B  ?
Never heard of Vinfast before about 1 minute ago, but I bet I could have gotten it rolling faster than 1 minute. But I am a car guy.  I used a communications system made by Martin Marietta in the military and it generated alarms CONTINUOUSLY for the most trivial things, which meant pretty much every one muted all the alarms and then missed ACTUAL alarm-worthy things (for example power source failure - shutdown in 3 minutes and counting).  My new Chevy when I first got it, I approached a stopped garbage truck in the (2-lane) road and as I got close I went into the passing lane to go around it, the nanny grabbed the steering wheel and steered me back into the garbage truck. I was able to out-muscle it once I realized what happened, but since I wasnt expecting "steer the car INTO a stopped truck which the car would have cleared easily" from a "safety device" I probably gave the guy a scare.
*Paid advertisement brought to you by VINFAST
The car industry is legit like the video game industry; dlcs, micro transactions, every company thinks they can charge premium prices, and now unfinished products
Do another one yay😂
What kind of drugs is the main guy on.  He used to be different
All those drive assist features just tells me some people should not be on the road. No amount of technology can help a bad driver.
Vinfast is controlled by the Chinese.
As a vietnamese i wouldnt buy that crap  i rather buy a cheaper but safer car 😂
Who in their right mind EVER buys the first several years of car production.
Vinfast was team worked with BMW. It should be good
tbh that compensation deal isn't half bad. $300 plus $100 per day if you have to take it back to the dealer. When my VW broke down I got nothing, not even a temporary replacement car while it was in the shop.
Any shits from communist DO NOT BUY IT, the makers themselves not even driving it.
VINFAST không chỉ là phương tiện di chuyển...nó còn là Người Bảo vệ bạn đạt chuẩn 5 * trên đường...Mong mọi người đừng vì moitj chút thoải mái khi sử dụng mà đánh đổi mạng sống của mình.Cám ơn những ai đã đọc cmt này.Một chủ sở hữu xe VF8 tại Viet nam.
This should teach AMERICANS 😋... don't buy cars from countries you were at war with like Vietnam... or Germany or Italy or Japan or England ... NEVERMIND.
Software upgrades could fix a lot of these issues.
So, this vehicle had the same approval protocol as the vaccines?
No software update is going to fix the suspension issues.
ANyone who would buy this car deserves everything they get.
How about we hit the reset button with EVs. We can restart in the 90s but with better tech. All your favorite designs but made as EV
Of course we can get this  in America but can't get what we would actually like and use. Such as the Suzuki Jimny, the new old school land cruiser, Mercedes Unimog etc
A blinker? Blinker? You mean a turn signal
офигенный ролик
Lane keeping without using a blinker is insanely dangerous, if you have to change lanes quickly to miss something on the road you sure as shit aren't taking the time to signal.  Sounds like this thing would make you slam right into the obstacle in front of you.
Hi, I'm from Vietnam, In my country you can not talk bad about the Vinfast's cars. You may get problems with the authorities or the company.   There are many people have tried to complain but they always have been shut down.
You’d have to have a skull full of fecal matter to buy an “electric vehicle”. 😂😂😂
Did the owner do a test drive before buying? Because, damn, what a piece of crap.
Dude in the blue shirt is discount Markiplier
Sounds like these cars are dropped to test and build something better 😂
All right so how much honda paid you for this? 😂
You look like Ryan Dunn in the thumbnail.
Vinfast; making pintos and Vegas look great! 🤪👍
If ya dont want bad reviews. Release the product when its complete. I wouldnt give them the 2nd review. They should have had these issues fixed before launch
They didn't test the sunroof that's on their list because of the cameras
Id love to see a reading from an EMF meter in that thing
Imagine someone trying to steal this car 😂
how unprofessional can you be eating chewing gum while filming a video
Definitely give it another chance. The more options we have as consumers, the better the market for us. Lower prices, better customer service, etc. We want competing brands!
Nice username. I swear i didnt know this when i picked mine. I find it funny ive always thought "no chance someone else has this"
The exterior looks like the Renault Kiger
I remember times when cars had no ipad on a dashboard.
It will take decades for them to be a Hyundai or Kia. Then again, there cars catch on fire lol! 😂
So all these bullshit electric cars. Getting into the USA but a individual can't import cool shit. Unless its 20 yrs old pisses me off.
That blinker things is really good, but the should implement it that the car can “disable it” when it sees something standing still on the road.
Just funny review to get views. You have to try on the real Vinfast cars for your own opinion.
Imagine being dumb enough to actually buy one of these. But then, some people bought the first Hyundais and KIAs and those companies have cursed us with horrible vehicles for decades after. You suck Vinfast buyers!
please do!!
Definitely 👍🏾 do it again
Can the software fix oversprung/underdamped?
I have a basic vehicle. No power windows, manual transmission, no AC, the basic of basics. But I have windows all around, and mirrors as well. You have no idea how people s*ck at driving. No situational awareness, cannot understand self explanatory road rules, needs to think so they stop, claim they are safe drivers but total dangers, I could go on... Gadgets are not only making people more oblivious, they already cannot manage a steering wheel and 2 pedals why would you ad more? The hilarious thing is a lot need to show off to prove they are better. But then simple things stop them like a ditch, a slight curve, or a snowy day, changing their own oil, not finding a charging station ...
This is my parents generation about Hyundai. Maybe in 30 years they’ll be good
I wonder why would anyone buy a car from a nameless car company in the first place, instead of purchasing one from a reliable brand.
You guys are so funny. 😂😂😂awesome job.😊
This car is literally a death trap you can't change lanes to avoid a collision or stomp on the gas, this is the vehicle you get if you want to kill your wife, 😂
50k for this shit, naah
Imagine being worse than the Mitsubishi Mirage.
Wow
ah yes, the most difficult start-up procedure, make sure you have your seatbelt on and your door are closed, press break, and click a damn button
Jesus Christ how would anyone with a same mind buy, this piece of shit? It’s more expensive than other reputable brands and has lower range!!! Is this a joke?
The VF8 sounds like buying a car in early access. 😅
At least they don't seem to catch fire like they say may Chinese made EV's do.
Always read the owners manual first.
what kind of gayy name is vinfast lol
I would never purchase an EV in a million years. Driving a vehicle where you need to draw a route to be able to access charging stations over a long trip, is just absolute stupid. Then if there's people in front of you waiting for a charge, well then, you'll be there all day. The worst attribute of that Vincrapshack, would be not being able to switch lanes without the blinker being on. If you need to quickly swerve to avoid anything, you're basically screwed! Wow, you get a front row seat straight to the accident! Then there's the zero response time when you stomp on the accelerator! Seriously? If you're not aware of this fact and you want to quickly jump into traffic from a stop sign, once again you're going straight to the hospital once you get T-boned! How this company hasn't been sued into oblivion for deadly accidents is beyond me.
Hire a professional to do your reviews, let these boys go back to moms basement
Not allowing you to change lanes with your blinkers off is straight up dangerous. What if there's a moose on the road?
This is EXACTLY what some British Manufacturers do... For instance have a friend who was head of a team desiging new 4x4 vehicle for vehicle for JCB. When it was going through testing to rectify glitches he was pulled off the project and told it was ready for producion. He was furious as was his fellow designers at the decision basically of ccountants putting profits before reliability. He quit and started work at another major competitor. In the days when John Bamford was alive, he knew every one of his 2000 employers names. Sadly when he died number crunching accountants came along and quality demised. Today if you buy a JCB it is necessary to buy an expensive insurance policy to resolve issues. If you don't you are likely to get clobbered by huge repair bills.. Fortunately with cars we have Toyota who are paA company who may go bankrupt soon or one that has call backs when needed to keep reputation and strives to continue to be number one?
Today someone find down this car was all parts , design from China and just assembled in VN  From cheap parts they want to sale equal Tesla prices 😅😅😅
50000 seriusly?At the start of the video i thought he said 15000 and i said thats resonable.After i ve seing the video it doesnt worth 1500.
Just a wild guess here... Not one of these sartorially challenged gentlemen has a wife or girlfriend... or knows what "satorial" means. 😅🤣😂
So a tesla
I'm not a fan of any steering override.
Honestly The fact that they are owning the flaws and compensating owners really earns them a revisit and follow up. Also I think they deserve props for actually owning it and have a plan to fix the issues deserves credit as it takes so bloody much to get the big manufacturers to honour warranties.
I couldn't handle the Drive Aid feature, most times I don't even use a Blinker.
Being as a driver only needs to figure it out the first time (assuming their memory is not shot) I hardly see where startup sequence is being complained about. It actually seems pretty quick.
Ah, Vietnam. Like China without QC.
I am also fan of Vin Diesel and Fast and Furious franchise, but they took it too far.
Vinfast? Buying cars on wish now huh?
They'll be back
Probably built by angry vietcong.
VINEGAR. Sour grapes.
gonna be that guy and say Cyberpunk played perfect at launch on Stadia.  RIP Stadia.
Giving you money for down time due warranty repair work is not something I've ever seen a care company provide. We didn't even get a loaner.
Volkswagon? (0:38)
I like how everyone said we would be driving chinese cars in the future when most of them have worse build quality than the russian.
No. Never.
$50k PIECE OF JUNK FROM THE COMMIE!
'Vinfast will be releasing fixes on a regular basis...'? These faults are not minor so how do they even release it in such a condition???
I'm surprised that car doesn't have more serious problems, structural problems, like for example a over-stressed chassis just barely hanging on, or suspension brackets poorly mounted to the chassis. You know the kind of stuff that instantly kills a car manufacturer.
The only thing I can imagine is trying to swerve to avoid an animal or any other road debris and the car not letting you turn, it shouldnt even legal its a huge safety hazard
If you happen to have that thingy long enough, it will become VinTage. ;-)
As a Vietnamese, I'm gonna say this is worth watching
Maybe its the reason they are only sold in Cali
Shameful free market in the United States, why don't your car companies roll out of China
The Accel pedal part in your video is stupid. You had to keep your feet on the pedal. You did it like you scare the car not the killer
I am amazed this worthless junk even got 1 star out of 5, should be 0
100 bucks for each ADMITTED FACTORY FLAW of the car i paid tens of thousands for?
Get that hot commie trash box out of this country.  I wouldn't take that car if you paid me to.
It's the price for me. If it was a $25k car, I might be willing to agree it was an OK car.
electric cars are retarded. just get a prius
As a vietnamese, I don't know how other people outside my country thing about the car. This video show me how they are really thought about it.
EVs......nope!
Are the cars that will be made in America work better?
no keyless entry and all plastic interior is insane
Good luck fixing the horrible suspension and catastrophic battery failure with software :D
see if you can turn the chimes off
Huynda kia recall over 100,000 car..wow
Tesla sued by american customer..wow
reasons to not buy the vinfast. It's ugly AF. The end.
I can't wait until Donut gets picked up by CornCob TV.
This POC company just received tax breaks to build a plant in NC.
Talk about throwing money at problems. Wow
If the easy to fix things are this bad, imagine how bad the build quality is. I guess there's a reason they didn't go into that topic.
So upgrade your suspension when you get your car and you can probably modify some kind of suspensions from some other car
I think I found my new car I can't see anything bad about it
What a shame it is such a bad car, it really looks great.
I got car sick watching this
WHOA! I thought you found my old Chevy for a minute
vietnamese govt pay nasdaily to praise this car , the propaganda is hilarious so fake  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like how they randomly switched the chimes and the assists segments in editing like we weren't going to notice 😅 just because they were on the white board in that order
Imagine buying a car that just works. A Nissan Versa.😊
NEVER TEST A VINFAST AGAIN.. EVER.. POS
Dear Editor: FIX THE AUDIO POPS ON THE CUTS
So now cars are early access..😂 soon they will be pay-to-drive
I bet you could find the VIN # on this car faster than starting it up. Maybe the emphasis as you said was put in all the wrong areas from the get go.
It does mostly appear to be software issues and surely the handling is an easy fix?
I refuse to buy or drive anything with a big screen in place of any gauges or dials.
Y’all think a Tesla is much better💀
This is the funniest sad thing I've ever seen 😅😢
The 2015 Tartan Prancer
I remember everyone losing their minds over cell phone usage in cars.... until Tesla put an IPAD in the driver face. Now you need one just to turn the lights on.   And no one seems to care. So weird.
do the follow up!
I think it’s still in beta
Before you test functions in a car how about understanding the specifications! The lane assist works totally fine. Is the lane assistance supposed to read your mind when you are changing lanes without an external input. That’s why you need the blinker.  Next is complaining that the EV doesn’t have a V8 sound
Vinfast given $ $ $ are Really Very&very BIG! You wasted USD 50K, got tons of problems to got they pay you $100 $300 for each your complaints they received. 🔥🔥🔥
Errmmm start up is just the same as tesla
Yeah give um another chance, it seems it’s mostly a problem of 1’s and 0’s over mechanics.
Du ma cong san
Tesla has just recall 1.1 million of their cars in China for safety concern. Why these youtubers dont' post this news in their channel ? Are they sponsored by Tesla ?. The Vietnamese people will not let these dirty youtuber bashing their company.
5:42 that Shelby’s mustang lookin AWSOME🙀🙀🥹
Good luck trying to drive this in winter.  Not letting you steer with out turn signals with black ice is criminal
we didn't appreciate the honda civic and toyota corolla enough.
This is what you call a Try Hard
Well i suppose at leat no one can steal it since its almost impossible to start if you don't know what you was doing. Even if they did know how to start it the annoying chimes would probably cause them to abandon it anyway
Car companies have spent years with teams of engineers doing modal analysis to eleminate undesirable noises, vibrations, and movements. this type of engineering is almost entirely empiral, not surprised it falls flat in basic ride quality, as historically this has taken a massive amount of resources for these companies to address. This company is what, 5 years old?
It sucks that Tom’s battery died. But other EVs have also bricked and/or caught fire now and then. Some CBE vehicles outright die for no good reason.   But overall this car would be a no for me right now. Wish them the best though, great to have more competition in the EV space
This car is vietnemese has it ever occurred to you that biased journalist is probably too sensitive about it?
This car even beats the Fiat 500 for a lemon peel award. It duplicates American manufactures by producing something before it is fully tested and debugged. It is given to the public to perform what should have been done in the factory BEFORE releasing it to the public. I would never pay 50 grand for a car built like that. Sorry fellas, but back to the drawing board.
Moral of the story never trust someone's opinion
the start up is just like in a tesla. just press brake pedal and put it in drive. ride quality as well. old tesla model-s dont have such a good ride quality either and is also making a lot of noises from tires and from all the loose cheap plastic inside. i´ve owned a 2013 tesla and a 2011 bmw, the tesla felt like an old corolla compared to the bmw.
vinfast 👎👎👎👎
Why come the car won't start?
I'm Vietnamese and most Vietnamese people don't like vinfast. They had great difficulty selling the cars out and had to set up a taxi company to use the cars. The number of defective cars is enough to say this is an incomplete model. Even these drivers complain because it's so bad and the number of halfway failures is too high. We still prefer Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi, Kia, Hyundai above all. We are really ashamed of this product.
maybe after one year... provide an update... but a new version might already be out.
Thank you to all of you who bought this beta release car so that they can work out the kinks and start selling good cars to the rest of us!
50 grand could get me a bmw 330i brand new and this car costing the same is laughavle
It looks like a rip off of a Renault Captur - I'm surprised they haven't sued!
I would like to see new update
Communist countries are well known for their quality products..
this is the reason why car ferries burn and our planet gets raped of precious metals FOR SHIT
Cars are just like games now. They sent it out as a minimum viable product and then just patch it and send updates. Not so good when your life depends on it.
Dìm hàng một cách quá đáng
Why can nobody make a car that just stops and goes? No frills, minimal electronics.
lol compared them to 2 video games that are just downright terrible, even after updates :)
Wait, this isn’t the Ford Pinto🤔
I'll stick with my diesel Audi for a few years yet. EVs seem to be a world of inconvenience and eye-watering expense.
You need to be a diehard communist, or a super duper Vietnamese patriot to buy this caR
This would be one of the worst cars to rip off or run from the police in. I mean, maybe that's kind of good thing maybe, but it's a hell of confused nanny state car to boot.
Vietnam😂
Pattern hantaran FB mudah sgt difahami..
Shut off while driving? You mean just like the Ford ranger 2018-2022? Or do you mean like the Ford ranger 2016-2019 losing reverse and 6th gear on the automatic transmission?  Funny how the big ultra wealthy companies severe build issues are forgotten. Especially with their car build and experience history.( New Zealand released models)
Electronics, suspension, door locks, geez.
There has been times when I was driving on a highway and I had to change lanes in an emergency.......  How can you do that in this car if you have to have your signal light on???
I don't think I would want a Vinfast for free, much less $50K.
So basically the biggest problem is software related. I remember back when cars didn't have software and that wasn't an issue. The more "progress" they make on vehicles the worse it gets and the more repairs that are required. Which costs FAR more than ever because they are so hard to work on.
Y'all remember Daewoo? Maybe Vinfast will start selling them two-for-one.
I like how it was going to be cheap Chinese cars here as the next killer app, then freaking Vietnam says hold by beer.
It was a no for me as soon as I saw there was no key to turn
The only problem with the car is the absurd price, it should cost no more than 20k.
Just cancel, recall them all and stop making these Vinfast garbages. Simple as that.
It is correct. If you don't have your blinker on you shouldn't cross the line.
It’s like a family guy skit with the $100 they give you for issues. Like they were at a board meeting and the CEO goes “you know what Americans love? Money! Just give them money and they’ll ignore the problems”
Funny that they tried to make an EV in the US while in Vietnam most people ride early 2000s motorcycles with funny helmet.
If they made the car like a early 2000's car thats just electric without all the garbage it would be nice. I don't want a computer screen in the car. I don't want driver assistance.  I want to get in the car and have full control and just drive it.
folks, seriously starting the video from something that clearly described in the manual - how to start the car? Many new EVs started from brake pedal...
my silverado doesnt have any of these issues, and the only thing that was an issue, was taken care of with a dod delete, no shut off start up, just works.... and it didnt cost me 50k either lol
I did as James said and followed Vinfast. Now my phone's bricked.
Can't change lanes without using the blinker?!?! So if you need to swerve to avoid an accident (that I have no faith this car will avoid on it's own) it'll jerk the wheel back and cause the accident anyways?!?! I think this is payback for our role in Vietnam honestly. Slow, calculated, automotive death sentence.
I read a lot of bad reviews about the car I bought. And guess what it’s been pretty dam good so far lol  But for real that car has a lot of issues by the looks and cars shouldn’t be leaving the factory like that.
A terrible suspension on a vehicle at that price point is unacceptable. One of the first things I noticed on the test drive of a brand new Touareg was the quality of the ride and handling. I bought one.
Ford is no longer the worst car in America.
Hey guys, I appreciate the effort, but this is a new electric vehicle. You have tested without review and go over the manual an the direction from book. Chimes and driver assistant can be reduce and adjusted from the main screen. After watched you two clowns about 15 minutes, I realized that you two are on the payroll of some company to do the negative review. I have a new 2023 tundra and it has several issues and recalled. Why don’t you pick on Toyota too!
I call it the Vietnam Yugo.
"But I did complain for quite a bit...", lol
As probably the first car from Vietnam, it would be a huge surprise if it reach the standard level
it feels like the designers of the car never had driven a car before.  The "blink to turn" feature should be ILLEGAL.
I saw a Vinfast the other day. Weird thing.
Absolutely! And a MSRP of $30K would be more appropriate!
Never even heard of vinfast until this video.  I wouldn’t buy it if it was 5k dollars.  Junk!
I'd rather have my own brain functions be in full control when driving. The Only Driver Assistance for motor vehicles should be traction control and anti lock brakes. Anything more is just idiotic, as you are putting none responsable people in the driving seats that shouldn't be responsible for driving.  If I want to swerve to avoid something dangerous in my lane I don't want my car to stop me from changing lanes.
My first guess would be that car is worth 25k max
I will not buy an EV that forces me to pay a monthly battery subscription fee, for the life of the vehicle.  If you are able to buy the battery, that will come at an added cost.
the real question is how bad does it stack up to first generation Korean imports and do you expect them to improve as quickly?   Kind of like the bounty for bug testing for buyers - even if its feels like car buyers actually paid for a open beta.
and Vinfast was never seen again
This company will never make money with that voucher/cash system; that’s gonna get exploited.
1:54 start up 3:36 directionals 4:08 warning chimes 6:10 lane assist 6:39 reverse 7:30 ride quality 9:10 after sales policy in regard to repairs 😠10:33 accelerator 10:57 I won't be buying one of these anytime soon. 🤔   12:16
👎
Heck my ICE vehicle's accelerator has about a second delay too 🤣 but it's a 15 year old Honda and nobody can figure it out so I live with it
Might be a similar situation to DeLorean motor company
Well isn’t it a bit obvious that Americans don’t like Vietnamese products 😅
8:00 tesla
11:10 then youre on the run, the autopilot suddenly kicks in and you cant turn without turning on your blinkers and showing the police where youre going
Wait, are you guys canadian?
Well, if there's any car that could use an LS swap...
It's an asian car. It is trying to make asian people drive well lmao
So are we now at the point, where we beta test unfinished cars in the real world, just like the gaming industry publishes unfinished titles?  This car would be so illegal here in the EU, especially the refusal to turn without blinkers.
bila negara pemakan anjing nak buat kereta, ceni lah jadinya
Tesla build quality 🤣🤣
Only slightly worse than a Tesla😂
Modern cars are the WORST. I would never in my entire life own anything newer than 2003. But... THIS car takes all the garbage qualities of modern cars and concentrates them into a shit-slurry.😂
Not gonna lie, I love its looks
I'm Vietnamese and I don't support this company
I am Vietnamese and the only think I like it is the exterior and interior lol
bro com on this car from my contry rate it 5 stars or i dont like the video
For sure worth a revisit!  I still wont like the car, but I'd like to see them do well with a platform I don't agree with.
50K for that car?. Really US you buying this?.
This car is a piece of S... You put your life in danger with is piece of S. You suit the Co. You get nothing. You life if a piece of S if you buy this car.
Did you guys get a new video editor? The audio is all over the place. ❤
This is a great example of what happens when you don't learn the lessons of British Leyland.
Imagine spending 50K on this piece of shit.
I did not know Renaults exist!!!
Yk..not allowed to switch a lane is a w in my book and should be a mandatory feature
Don't give them another chance. If it's garbage at launch assume it'll be garbage forever. If they can get away with releasing a car with potentially fatal bugs they'll do it again, and others will follow suit.
I don't think I could buy a car from Vietnam. USA, Germany, Japan are the 3 car makers in my eyes, with South Korea JUST kind of edging in there now. I know other countries make cars but I wouldn't want them. Even if I had 300k to spend, from all my reading/watching a Porche is more worth it over a Ferrari/Lambo. I like Vietnamese and Italian food way better than German food but when to comes to cars it's Germany or USA for me, all the way.
Wait until you hear about the trabant
It's almost as bad as if SAP was a car. But then it would have taken a lot longer to get it going.
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is very beautiful ❤️   In as much as I don't like EVs  It's beautiful
Even if that Vietnamese electric car is bad, perhaps Tesla might fix that problem swapping in Tesla Technology as an option.
its hilarious because $100 is like half of a grocery trip in todays economy
All I need to know
Do u remember when HYUNDAI was the worst car sold in the late 90's, they fixed the car's problems and now it's becoming top 10 car manufacturer in the world.  I'm sure this brand will fix all the problems.
Khổ bác vượng vãi :))
Revisit it! I am interested :D
Reservation holder in North Carolina…VinFast hasn’t reached out or communicated well. They promise sooo much, but do sooo little.
You guys ever heard any company sued their customers because they complaint car’s fault ? 😂😂😂 And ever heard any company that said who didnt buy their cars is not a Vietnamese patriot.  Now you guys heards🎉🎉🎉
Must not have driven a Mitsubishi mirage
OMG a road hazard
Ur comparing a car that took 1 Yr to make to a game that was in development for almost a decade??   ...but I understand what ur trying to say. They both performed awfully at launch.
0:38 volkswagon lol
This is a Beta-quality product to ship, still full of bugs and quirks. I think the delay on the accelerator is to stop nanas and granddads from accidently going full-send through a shop window. Seen it on a lot of Chinese and indian EVs recently.
Retry with the updates pls
other than the suspension it looks like most\all of these issues can be fixed with software updates.  The battery failure was bad, but that may also be software (it may have blow a fuse, or set a overcurrent condition, remains to be seen if that's software or not)  The small refunds are a bit funny...but you know what? i've never seen another company offer jack, so it's a win in my book.  When my 2022 kona EV charge port decided to not unlock the charge cable i had to get it towed 175km to the nearest dealer (which wasn't fully covered), wait 2 weeks to catch a bus down to pickup a loaner, than another 2 for them to get the part and fix it.  I love this car, but goddamn, they could have just put a emergency release on the charge port...or just not included the lock feature at all.  Meanwhile instead of spending 2 bucks a day for those first two weeks, i was spending 25$ a day to get to work in my brother's truck, more like 15$ once i got the loaner, none of which was re-inbursed.  I'm not recommending anyone buy the vinfast, but damn i feel like they are trying hard.
This car company straight up released the car version of an early access video game…
I'm getting a vin fast car plant in my state.........fuck
I hate this electronic shit so much. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
What car company that wants to break into any market sells their cars at $50k? When Kia wanted to break in with the optima they were selling it a lot cheaper than it’s competitors.Honestly, just as was mentioned in the video; if they made an EV that was around 20k with standard amenities, it might be a good option for many people just wanting an entry level car and then convincing them to go EV
Buyers are just legit beta testers
Yeah but No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk have a key difference. They're $70 not $50,000
You get in to turn on your car and get out a lot thou
Really beaultiful car,they prefer drive slow and ugly cars in united states
How about instead of relying on the "driver aid", people actually learn how to drive? The "driver aid" should be backing you up, not doing the driving for you. You are supposed to be driving, not everything else.
I have to appreciate them being so self-aware that they called their assistants Drive AIDS... Drive Cancer would've been fine, too ;]
damn for 50k that is TRASH
Lol wtf happened to you hair?
And this is why, EV cars are not the solution. These EV companies that pops up out of nowhere bcs of the easy to get EV drive terrain from various manufacturers is giving EV a bad rep. GIVE US HYDROGEN POWER!
No matter what people say, I always hope that a car company from Vietnam called vinfast will be accepted by everyone and everyone please give us a chance to change❤️❤️❤️🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 Thank you
Oh, look. Another electric medium-sized generic SUV. How exiting.
Fish head car….never
Must have been an ass setting up that camera in the back only for that angle not to be used :)
That car sucks
All of a sudden I feel better about financing my $40,000 Tacoma
Electric cars are too new to own. And way too expensive
Did nolan hit puberty?
Maybe by then, you guys can get to the bottom of its actual safety rating
Don't lie. Cyberpunk is still garbage😂😂
I busted out laughing at the No Man’s Sky and Cyberpunk analogies.
Two Donut channel guys haven't learned how to use a new car, particularly EV, so they make inaccurate or even wrong assessments.  I wonder if these two guys kown how to use a smart phone!
Ha ha, how can you review a car you can not even start.   RTFM.
Seems like the Vietnamese have been taking notes from the Koreans. Nothing is more satisfying than watching these fucking things fail. "Just make a car and make it electric, stop trying to make everything wierd."
😂 .... *LEMON LAW!!*
The open roads are not a place for beta testing.  Manufacturers should not be rewarded for releasing early access vehicles to "patch" later.
Im in Vietnam and there is a taxi company full of VF8 in mint paint. There are so many of them that every 2 minute you meet 1 and wonder is this a loop
I wonder how the real owner feels about her car.
What do you expect from something built too fast and from a company without experience
This company is genius.  They designed the Blinkers for Americans.  We all know Americans hate to use their blinkers and when they do use them they love to keep them on.
Remember when China tried selling cheap cars in America? It lasted about two weeks. This company will be Casper in 6 months
El Gibl customers
Once again a great review.  But that fucking blinker is like the old lady work at a Chinese grocery :) she work when she pleases haha
50 k for a car you touch shoulders in? who's more insane? the makers or the buyers?
I feel bad enough buying a AAA video game that turns out to be more of a beta test. No way I'm beta testing a $50,000.00 vehicle for no man or beast that walks this earth.
Man typical white boys. Talking trash.
There are idiots who are not knowledgeable about electronic technology who are experts in evaluating electric vehicles. What stupid thing is happening to the people of the USA
White boys talking trash as usual.but You know  years later you and your mom will buy one. Just like ya'all complain about honda ,toyota, nissan and huyndai. Look at them now, they doing way better then shitty American cars.
Dog
Donut guys, you are not fare. Please said true thing.
13:11 WHOA!  No cap, lots of hair.  Fancy.  Really makes me think differently about you.
How could you release a car that's so bad that it clearly wasn't driven or used by the people who made it?  Actually I have a guess... it's a company full of Yes Men who agree with and only tell positive stories to the rich owner.
Issue #1 - it's an electric vehicle.
Blud definitely has beef with alternative fuel 💀
Vinfast. VIETNAMISE brand car made by COMMUNIST party. WHY IT IS IMPORTED TO THE US ?? GOV WANTS TO KILL US BRANDS, TRAITORS
Think we also have to understand that the people reviewing the cars has something to gain from trashing new car makers
The start-up requires you to have a seatbelt on, and you have to turn on your turn signal to turn? This vehicle just seems to want to force safe driving.
Getting money back for issues and service time, I'd subscribed to that. Over the course of 1.5 years I've had over 30 service appointments with M3 and MYP. I wish I hwd gotten money back for all the crap Tesla produced.
This flying turd looks remarkably like a Renault Koleos.
hmm .. wierd .. i wondered why i havent been recieving any Donut notificians .. seems Youtube removed that i subbed to Donut .. that explains alot
You dudes need to do a vid fixing the shocks and springs
Review indian brands Tata and Mahindra
WinFax
Vietnam should be introducing simplicity to their citizens. They treat cars like a toy and cannot even look left and right, or turn on their lights at night, let alone drive what is potentially a deadly weapon amongst other human beings. Driving is not a computer game.
this looks like a new renault
you unfairly evaluate a young car company and use few vulgar words like fuck... not worthy of a big car channel!
This is hilarious 😂, you don’t have to be an engineer to know nowadays cars run on millions of lines of computer code and it requires years to fix most bugs (never perfect as the saying goes). Some unfortunate Vinfast owners may die in this car!
And unlike a buggy game, a buggy car can actually kill you. Don't forget that part.
It's like the US Federal Government  designed and released a car!
I just don't get it. Who are the people who sit down and say, yes we want to spend 50k on the car, and I don't want an ID.4, I don't want a Mach-E, I Don't want a Rav 4, I don't want a lot of proven cars. I want THIS. The depreciation of these will be astronomical.
This car company is in Irvine spectrum, and as soon as the sales person said it was made in Vietnam, I was like no,  I'll pass. When was the last time you heard Vietnam made something awesome, besides good suits. I usually don't get excited and jumped up and down when I find out something I recently bought was made in Vietnam. I'm just saying
seeing you guys write volkswagon as a car specific channel hurt me personally
What Nathalie think about your review when you bashed her car ?.
Only 128 car registrations in U.S since January,  this company will go under.  One registration in February, followed by 16 in March, 66 in April and 45 in May.
Reminds me of first few years of Hyundai and KIA. My cousin had a earlier model KIA, he made an aggressive turn, I was holding on that holder thingys and it came right off in my hand 😂
The vinfast ev looks interesting but yeah Vinfast made a bad start of their car release. If they can resolve or they learn their mistakes, it would be competitive as an affordable EV brand. However it is amzing that vietnam also excels in their technology
6:12 cant swerve to avoid debris or pothole etc
Well where to start I agree with the early release of the vehicle when it's riddled with bugs ummm to be honest want a decent electric vehicle go Hyundai ioniq 45k and your set the best feature is when the side mirrors dip so you don't scratch the rims 😊
Made in Vietnam like Vin Crash,Vin Trash
Next time try the fastest speed you can drive on that car
Push button ignition just SUX....
iv never even heard of vinfast until this video came up as a random suggestion......
Follow-up vid!
Please dont waste your time lol nobody is buying this for $50,000...do your review when they drop it to 20,000 haha
This is what happens when mediocre software developers decide to make a car
My car has to work, not fail and give me $100. Under many circumstances, the cost to an individual for a failure could be far more than a few hundred dollars.
It’s the electric version of when Daewoo came on the US market in the late 90’s.
Where is this piece of crap made?
I’m guessing maybe in the will fix it to actually down the road. But I guess that’s just a pipe dream.
The Hat makes you 20 years younger. Wow.
The real reason is that VinFast refused to pay off the journalists to get positive reviews.
Vinfast is picking up in Toronto, but only because they're tons of Vietnamese that flock to rep it. Maybe stick to phở for a bit.
Fire 🔥
A car should never take more than a day to service
To laugh and stomp on the gas pedal like an idot and stupid guy, man.
"Vinfast  contacted us" 2 crisp 100 dollar bills fell out of the envelope
Wow. Yet another overpriced, over-technologied EV with a stupid tablet  grafted into the center of the dash. Instruments are supposed to be placed in front of the driver for a very good reason. A bad clone of a Tesla which is another car I wouldn't be caught dead owning. Lose about $20K of the unnecessary, unreliable, expensive, and - in this case - glitchy "technology" and we'll talk. EVs should be CHEAPER than ICE vehicles, needing only a battery, a motor, a good PWM controller, and an E-meter (for battery state monitoring). Instead, we're given overpriced rolling iPhones. No thank you. Real cars don't need software!
"in hindsight it is pretty intuitive" Is the most self contradictory sentence ive ever heard.
Duck you all
You drive a Chineese car = brain dead
Just to add to my previous comment, I would rather give myself AIDS than drive this car
yea id like to see if the update does anything at all lol
Okay I'm going to defend this car at 8:36 when they were driving on the 405 freeway in Los Angeles it's a very bumpy right there I would not do a review driving on that freeway and expecting for it to be a smooth ride right there where I know exactly where they were at it's very bumpy right there even if you have a high-end German luxury or Japanese car you can still feel some type of bump the freeway is bad right there they were driving north on the 405 going towards the Valley passing Olympic and Santa Monica
Follow up please!
Here in Canada, we got Hyundai cars before the United States. We had the Hyundai Pony and the Hyundai Stellar. 1984-1986 cars with manual chokes, no catalytic converters, and if you can get your head around this, they had POINTS IGNITION! I had to change points and condenser and set dwell on my 1985 car!  About a week after buying the Stellar (a 9-year-old car) for $100, it was a rainy cold night. Rear window defroster, front defrost fan, wipers, headlights, ignition circuit loads. Bosch alternator under the hood. Voltage gauge was dropping..... I thought it was an instrumentation fault until the lights got dim and the engine cut out. Fortunately, I was on a hill and was able to turn off all the electrical loads and get the car rolling and re-start it by dropping the clutch.  Bosch alternator - nothing wrong with it - but only rated for 40A. Rear defroster, 20A. Front blower fan, 20A. Wipers, 10A. Headlights and parking lamps, say 15A. Ignition, say 5A. Whatever the case, the alternator, from the factory, was not big enough to run the car on a cold rainy night. What a joke.  I had a 105A alternator from an old Volare police car. It was almost a direct bolt-in. Started up my Hyundai Stellar with the cop car alternator installed and the voltage gauge was solidly pegged around 14V no matter what I turned on in the car. And this was a "luxury" car with air conditioning (never worked) and power everything. 40 amp Bosch alternator from the factory. Jesus wept.
In the first minute I can see they are ripping off Tesla. Even the dealer sign.
Give Natalie 100USD for borrowing her car 😄
Two idiots go to evaluate the car
What about the car safety tests?
Not being able to change lanes without the blinker would be a huge safety issue!  What if I need to perform a quick maneuver to avoid an accident, or child that ran out into the street?
Looks like the styling is directly ripped from a Renault.
The fumes on the inside are agent orange.
The CP2077 reference hurt, bro. Punched in the gut all over again.😆
Beautiful car, ugly issues.
I won't buy an EV. But if I did for some reason, I would want one that assumes I know how to operate a vehicle safely, and am aware of my surroundings. What's up with all the weird shit these days? No wonder people don't pay attention, they think their car will save them every time lol.
If the channel owner doesn't know how to use the car, Vinfast is a reputable channel, so learn how to use the car and then share it with everyone.
I'm rooting for Vinfast. It's great to see more competetion within the auto market... but wowee this has some real glairing issues... My only bit of advice is for them to purchase it's successful competitor vehicles and pull them apart to see how they work.
I saw one 2 years ago and I told my SO I was never buying one based on the construction and qc problems I saw.
The lane assist is simply dangerous. I have had it on a couple of rental cars. Not only in emergency evasive maneuvers, but in some construction zones, it xan follow the wrong lines. On a Toyota Carolla it slmost steered me into a Jersey barrier.
I want to see new upcoming EVs
Honestly, the seatbelt thing itself is a "no sale" for me unless I could hack it to disable it. Are you expected to put your seatbelt on to move a car down your driveway?
I was going to invest into vinfast when they came public in canada but forgot about it. Good thing i didnt
Lol. No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk 😂. I wonder how many motorheads crossover with gamers to be able to identify with that reference.
I don't care what hi tech bullshit a car has, if it's taking the control out of the drivers hands for any reason, it's not road worthy. What are all these assists? Is the average person unable to perceive when they should switch lanes now? What's the point of getting your license then?
I was in vietnam earlier this year and saw a vinfast there and was mostly fascinated.  I knew it'd have problems, but its neat to see something being tried by another country.  Also, its probably largely because buying a car in vietnam is absolutely insane because of import taxes.  your standard camry or civic can run almost 70k usd.
I don't buy anything from the VietCong. Their products are like those from a dollar store. They look nice on the outside and will fall apart when you use it.
6 sound effects a second
look like you guy have no experience with electric car . find out how to use the car before review it
Love the comparison to some of the broken video games forced out, the difference is death in a game because of a bug vs real life bug that could lead to actual death.
Look like you guys 1st time driving an EV. Don’t know any về common sense features!? Or you guy bought to review
Người mua ho thông minh lắm ho đâu cần phải nghe hai thằng này ho tư thử xe ho tự biết xe như thế nào mà
1.9 TDI swap it
The question is why wait for them to get it together when there are so many other reliable brands with equal or better performance at the same price?
2 clowns. Drive EV first review later, man.
No, no, no, no do not give car companies the same idea as the scumy game publishing comoanies because a couple years down the line every brand would be using the method "sell broken, fix later" . Plus its an EV, it can crash and burn for all its worth.
My only challenge is the price, but the software issues are easy  to fox.
Unreliable review from a dirty youtuber.  👎👎👎👎
Oh the Nguyen mobile
hey thats ok i feel the same in my toyota about all those things.
HEY, WHAT ABOUT THE SOLAR ROOF?
Lol Vinfast?! 😂
So we're treating cars like software products now? It's fine, Day 1 Patch will take care of that, just ship it?
beautiful cars!!!❤
I dont care if its a brand new company or not. If it costs 50,000 then there shouldn't be any issues like this
Y’all should try the mini EV. It’s a mini. But EV.
given the time it took you guys to figure out how to start the car I guess you've never driven a tesla before. So much for a car review channel.
These guys are the worst reviewers. They need to be replaced
Can't wait to see when it's updated =)
Hey the sunroof test got changed for driving aids
Here's the truth! Vinfast is not new having manufactured electric vehicles (EVs) since 2018 when the first fully electric motorbike Klara was made. So far, VinFast has made tens of thousands of EVs including VinFast e34 (a smaller version of VF8), VF5, VF8, VF9, and especially VinBus known as VinFast fully electric public buses carrying 50-60 passengers at a time. Most importantly, a fleet of over 120 units of VinBus since December 2021, has been providing service between the cities, every day from morning to night - from 5:00 to 21:00, 7 days a week transporting a total of over 150 million passengers in Vietnam (equivalent to about half of the total US population) - average 300,000 passengers per day. Surprisingly, NOT a single unit of VinBus catching fire or exploding or losing control, has been reported so far! Also, tens of thousands of units of VinFast e34 and VF8 have been on the road safely in Vietnam since 3/2021 and 9/2022, respectively. Similarly, NOT a single unit of the Vinfast EVs catching fire or exploding or losing control, has been reported! This clearly solidified the quality and safety standards of Vinfast EVs. Have any other EV makers achieved what Vinfast did? Go figure! Technically, YouTuber Sandy Munro in one of his VF8 videos, did talk about Vinfast's patented technology for its EV battery isolation. According to CTIF (International Association of Fire and Rescue Services), up to 40,000 gallons of water is needed to put out a fire in an electric car like Tesla! Don't take my word for it. Look it up for yourself. EVs are supposed to be environmentally friendly, but what's the point of using 40,000 gallons of water to put out only one EV like Tesla? What do you think?
I wonder if it will be better at not killing motorcyclists than tesla
OK! My little beotches, I have some important news to share with you guys. VinFast is going to build its first EV assembly plant in North Carolina, US and the groundbreaking ceremony will be next week. Eat your heart out, my little beotches!
Ugh James, Nolan. I... I  know the problem. it's electric.  And I know people out there who are going to ask, what's the problem with electric vehicles? To which I will respond we don't know what to do with our battery and electronic waste from our parents lifetime. What are we going to do with all this new waste?
I rather buy Chinese car
Very good 👍
Unreliable review from dirty American youtuber
Bro can u give me that car ? I just need a ride better that Uber
If you spend 50k on a car from a country most people didn't know makes cars, you deserve a Vinfast.
what happened to the sunroof category
Imagine the guy in front of you slams on the brakes so you swerve but your car says "you didn't turn on your blinker" and plows into the back of an F250.
Vinfast the name itself is horrible.
Years later will be in gokarts or something else crazy.
Here’s hoping Vinfast can work out these issues and can provide a competitive product.
Why will we get a ticket for being on your phone? (I agree that you shouldn’t be on your phone while driving) but all new cars basically have a laptop for controlling almost every thing… makes no since.
OK! My little beotches, I have some important news to share with you guys. VinFast is going to build its first EV assembly plant in North Carolina, US and the groundbreaking ceremony will be next week. Eat your heart out, my little beotches!
9:54 VinFast gonna go BrokeFast.
I've never had a driving assistance technology do anything other than almost wreck my car or give me whiplash. Except for passive assistance like blind-spot monitors, I turn all of it off, and I take the car back if I can't.
They say Donut musta rigged somethin…
It’s a none starter in America. Ship them all back to Vietnam fast! It’s cool I’ll get something made here in the states and not have to lease a battery but own the entire car. What a scam.
Unliked
"You think you hate it now honey but wait till you drive it."
that lane assist would be interesting to test on I-465 East Bound from Kentucky Ave. to I-65... remarked lanes without removing original lane markings.
He says it right at the end: make a car that is A CAR, just electric powered and electronically controlled. Don't try to make people learn to drive all over again.    And a whole second of latency between step on the pedal and you  accelerate? What, it's pausing to verify that you got nothing in front of you?  Makes me proud of my lame CVT Nissan.
DO AN UP-TO-SPEED ON THE MAZDA MX-3 PLEASE
Nathalie a gentle Vietnamese girl gave them her Vinfast VF8 for testing . Instead to thank her these dirty Donuts made false bad comment about her car. She must be very angry now .
it sounds that the software related items were options left in the software that were never appropriately adjusted. Bad suspension won't be fixed with a software patch, and what's worse, you know that no one is actually test driving these cars in the development process. Vinfast: Find some industry folks to help you build this car. Hyundai did it by grabbing up people from BMW and other automakers years ago and now they're a strong company with a good product. OR, you can do what Deawoo did and trial and error your way through it, in which case you'll be out of business by next week.
Lexus is250 review  lol
Someone needs to send one of these to Aging Wheels. It's entirely the kind of thing he'd love.
dumaa
my parents thought about it and isaid it was absoloutley awful
The Jeep Compass loves to turn itself off while you're driving.
For God so loved the workd he sent his only beggoten son to die for us. Im here to tell you repent and belive in the Lord Jesus Christ. ✝️
Whoever designed this car is an ass. These are the people you want to scream at about an inch from their face.
Wtf happened to the sunroof problem I’m the middle of the video??? 😂
Nathalie is  too nice. She just lent her car to a dirty American youtuber
Imagine if you just need to move your car just a couple inches : buckle up and close the door . Or being super close to a hole, rock or branch and having to back up with the door open to see exactly what you're doing : impossible.  Now not being able to switch lane without blinker, that's interresting because in case of emergency you need to crash in what's in front of you without the possibility of evasive maneuvre : be ready to kill some pedestrian and bicyclist.  When you're waiting at the traffic light and see that big rig in your rear view mirror and you understand he's not gonna stop : Stomp the gas and move to the left or right. Nope you're the speed bump for that truck. That thing sounds like a freakin death trap to me.
You gotta have someone drive it who doesn’t already know it’s got a crappy rating
Do a follow up, yeah. This company looks like they jumped the gun on the car's release, but they also seem like they are very invested in making things right.  It's just kind of a bummer that your comparison to video games that need a patch is so spot on. A car is something you should be able to expect will just...work.
It's not even 8am and I am going to predict that this is the funniest thing I will hear all day ... "In hindsight, it's pretty intuitive."
7:58 Isthat Atesla?
(DON'T) think VinFast !
Kind of reminds me of early Tesla that had shit like all brakes automatically shutting off whenever a wheel took damage (never fully fixed, still happens on wheel loss) or an 'Autopilot' that's an outright fraud and tried to bury people into oncoming traffic (still not fixed) and repair times for simple bumper fixes that took 40+ weeks.  How on earth is 'If you don't have your blinker on you can't accidentally change lanes' a point of criticism? That's not a computer mistakes: Anyone who does that is a dumbass driver and the computer's smarter. Good feature and most cars have it these days. That's only  a bad thing if you're a reckless driver who just wants to randomly swerve all over the road. Kinda like those guys yelling that motorcycle helmets and seatbelts are stupid.
I'd watch the follow up. Honestly I want to see them succeed, we bombed Vietnam almost into the 19th century 60 years ago and they still managed to get us tf out of their country. I'm rooting for their industrial emergence. Remember Hyundai cars in the 80's? And look at them now. Daewoo, Kia, all worthwhile cheap cars these days. Vietnam deserve a chance at some US Dollars too.
Covid?????    OH, you mean the china-virus.....
You lost my interest with the word EV.......      Wait, Hmmm, is EV a word ????
another problem with this car is on a sunny day when the heat of the car/ battery is too high, the car need to use air conditioner to cool off the battery so the driver/ passenger will not receive any cool air, just fan
As a Vietnamese and an owner of this car, I couldn't agree with you more
Update video! ❤
I Think Russell that Donald and Robert should work together... Imagine That just think about for a second... They may not like each other but... they Respect each other and they both want the Counrty Unified!
Constructive. No deliberate shaming kind of review. Professional.
when the vibes are "it is trash at best"
Why do you stop many time on the gas pedal when acceleration test?
There was a perfect opportunity at 10:15 to slip in that meme “here’s a 100 to F off “
There are some American that still not accept their defeat in the Vietnam War. They will do everything to destroy a Vietnamese car company. There are a lot of positive opinion about Vinfast VF8 from prestigious review for example The Engaget The JD Power and from Canadian and European press but these Donuts guys décide to ignore them.
How did VinFast get approval to sell in the US market so fast? I would assume it would take more than a year to go from testing to sales. Doesn't even have safety rating yet.
I'm interested in the follow up. Torched em in the vid. If they have already fixed some issues, I feel like it's only fair to give them credit. I rarely wish for failure
Please read the user manual carefully before use.
Allows Vietnamese cars to be reviewed on British Top Gear. They will blow up the car with dynamite before reviewing it. But Top Gear wouldn't want to review a crappy car from a small country in Asia.
Side note: Blind spot DOES NOT WORK below typically 10mph
In the US, are there unlimited highways as good as in Germany? To test the ability to run 200km / h of Vf8 (See if the manufacturer is lying?)
Gonna be honest, the money back thing is pretty nice even if it seems trivial.  Like so many other manufacturers just... Would not even aknowledge issues. So it doesnt make me wanna buy the car, but it is a good sign if they keep working at making better vehicles in the future (like several korean brands that started off slow)
So the very first thing they "test" is guessing how to start an EV from a maker they've never dealt with before? How the hell is that even remotely connected to reality?
The new Smart #1 has the same start up procedure.
Trash!
Honestly go try to drive a yugo
The biggest problem is with the st@pid name. Other than that, you get what you pay for.
Last time I checked, my 1972 Oldsmobile Toronado still has a real metal key used to start the engine.
good put your blicker on you nerd. plz god.
They are some American that are still not accept they lost the Vietnam war so  they decide deliberately from the beginning to destroy a Vietnamese brand by making false comment. There are a lot of positive review from prestigious American publication about Vinfast VF8 for example the Engaget The Detroit Bureau JD Power Novak Channel and from Canadian and European press but this channel decide to ignore them.
I don’t trust Vinfast at all but according  to the review I think their ADAS did the best things to keep the driver safe, turn it off if u don’t like it
I wanna see it!!
why would anyone buy this car over a less expensive Tesla?
I saw one of those things in the wild recently. I should have asked the owner how it was working for him.
Follow up is needed on this one.
You guys are spelling Volkswagen with o?
This car might be bad, but you haven't driven Lexus UX which is just as bad. Noisy, jerky and it actually shudders in reverse when turning. 2/10.
Trong tô phở Có con dáng cần hợp tác các cơ quan vũ trụ tìm sự cân bằng
You know what I absolutely hate these types of modern electric cars. I'm much better off with a oldschool engine that's fun to drive
So Vietnam has now invaded the U$A after defeating us under Nixon?
A car that makes decisions for you in a world where none of the other cars are doing that is just going to end up getting you in trouble.  I would imagine a cop wouldn't give two shits about you claiming the car stopped you from turning or accelerating.  I'd also like to see a software patch fix the bouncing.  Imagine saying "I just bought a new car, it's immediately in the shop, and I'm calling an Uber to get around, but the car manufacturer won't compensate me until the 4th day"
So this car seemed to be made for people who have never driven or being in a car ever.
Day 378:Of Asking Donut Media to Build a Ford Thunder (you can call it the Ford Lightning Lightning if you want
Can we talk about the leather on the steering wheel ?
oh boi HENRY IS BACK BBY! 01:00
I really want to see a follow-up please!
Cant think you guys stupid enough to click click on the acceleration pedal wishing it speed up. What a shame!
I’m watching 2 comedian ?
I think some of those come down to build quality for why you guys didn't have some of the same problems as others
I'd like to see an update, but maybe give it a 3 or 4 months for them to really get the bugs worked out.
I remember when they made decent petrol cars from BMW parts. Yeah they should have stick with it.
A $50K EV built in very low-wage Vietnam means gigantic profit margins.
Another example of excess and  needless complexity.
not being able to switch lanes without blinkers on is absolutely dangerous in case of emergencies where you need to quickly turn the steering wheel. what a piece of garbage.
Can't change lanes without blinkers?  Why can't this feature be added to BMWs? 🤣
Commenting for part 2
Therefor EV's are a joke, IC enigines pls
Vinfast only imports equipment from China and assembles it
Chúc mừng Vinfast thành công rực rỡ trên đất Mỹ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
isnt the start up procedure same as tesla?
I hope they fix their issues and can make tangible improvements because I like the styling and definitely support a new brand building cars in the US.
Do not risk your life buying vinfast ev please do your study carefully as there are many issues that caused to accident (dead) in Vietnam which the company trying to cover up their issues and some owners end up in jail because they speak up the truth that the company can’t fix the issues. Vinfast has try everything like fake their number of EVs sale just wanted to get on IPO in America and now they just announced that they going to start to build their manufacture in North Carolina USA end of July 2023 , I’m sure they not going to build it, like what they did in Melbourne Australia 😅 one of the dirty companies in vn got backup by communist party!
Who is buying this car for $50k? Crazy.
My Altima is already 10x better than this car.
My Vietnamese students call it Vinslow.
50g for that shit box? Its like what white guys do with viet girls.  Pay a lot for crap. 😂
If they want me to be a beta tester, they should be charging about $15k-$20k less. This thing is half baked.
Sounds like money laundering 🤔
But why did you switch it from "sunroof" to "drive aid"?
Communism is so bad that even their cars don't work.
I was under the impression Vinfast cars were supposed to be affordable...apparently not.
The world is laughing at the fact that nothing is American anymore. 🖕
Looks like a Tesla to me... a Tesla with a slight better looking (it doesnt look like an ugly boat). An expensive glorified golf cart.
Car company owned a dude named Phat says it all for me.
Despite how much automotive journalists want to make EV's a "thing," sales are tanking.
Give them another chance, it’s rare these days that a company wants to make things right.
Front of the car reminds me of the Pontiac Aztek.
It's clown car men! Do not drive it, your life worths more than this stupid car.
Good things that you guys live in America where you guys have the freedome of speech. Whereas if you lived in Vietnam, and did horrible reviews about VinFast, you guys would be terrorized, jailed, cancelled, and eventually you had to put up an article with apology to VinFast about the bad reviews you guys made.
11:51 “Pff hehe car broken” 💀
Years ago, products were tested before releasing them to the market. Now you get patches to solve the software problem. Glad it's only a tech problem, as I don't know how to download a bearing upgrade 🤣
$50K? Seriously? Hell no.
The 1956 Buick had a similar start-up - only no seat belts!
Day 100.of ask8ng for any up to speed. O wait yah done with donut lost a fan threw my only donut shirt away it was over priced 2
BMW drivers need that blinkers so bad
I like vin fast even though you guys tell me not to.
This is the issue with electric cars. Updates! A car will never be perfect but having to wait for an update is ridiculous. Makes cars almost undrivable
Nolan’s CornCob TV shirt💀
I see no point in buying this compared to a Tesla. Idk about America, but 50k for something like that.. uh. In my country you can get a Model 3 LR with 42k.
When they finally make gasoline illegal and we all have to drive electric cars, I'm just going to get a fork lift motor and DIY set it up in a converted 1998 Honda accord.  In theory, there doesn't have to be anything wrong with electric cars, but just because they are new, they are baking everything wrong with cars into them.  Kind of like how all new movies suck.
Looks like a Renault.
If it was worth like 20k, it would be a nice deal.
When you refer to a highway in Cali as “Tha” like “tha 405, to Tha 5” you know you are a cali native
$50,000? Should be like $30,000
Yeah, lets let the laziness and lack of concern plaguing the software industry cross over into the automotive industry, even comparing it to some games known for this.  Nothing like your car requiring a day-0 patch, no; stop it; don't promote it, don't buy this shit, speak with your wallets.
You had sunroof on the list instead of drive aid Where is that??
i don't get the issue with the blinkers? BMW has been making cars for 95 years without working blinkers, and none of you care about that either. and maybe it was just user/maintenance error. did anyone bother to check the blinker fluid levels? maybe they had ran dry and did not work because of that.
Great vid! I'm Vietnamese, this is the first company in our country to ever sell cars in the US market. The flaws and complaints about this car are undeniable for the time being. But the thing is, this company is 6 years old, and they've only been making EVs for roughly 2 years, and they are making apparent efforts to improve. Like the story of Toyota when they first set foot on US soil, we need time.  Tbh I expected the aggressive comments on this car but instead y'all supporting our products, genuinely looking forward to updates and bug fix, and I appreciate that sm <3  Còn mấy thằng tự nhục xem lại nhé, bọn Tây nó còn hiểu vấn đề, hãng mới xe mới thì lỗi là quá bình thường, nó còn muốn xem Vinfast sửa lỗi thế nào. Bày đặt "Tôi là người VN và tôi còn thấy VF8 như cứt", "pick me up daddy" à? Bố ỉa vào đầu chúng mày.
Professional reviewers calling turn signals "blinkers". Questionable.
Damn, there's a lot of VF's employees in the comments
Here to beg for more educational content.
The car gives you a headache?
While it doesn't jerk like that seemed to do, you can't really change lanes in a Toyota either that has lane assist on. You have to force it a bit, something you don't really want to do at 120kph.
This might make sense if the car was inexpensive, but it isn't. Hyundai was crap when they first started, but they were a good value because they were cheap crap, so they found a market.
>Electric 0/100, throw it in the garbage.
Rented an alfa Romeo Tomale recently and it's like they spent all their time and money on features in the screen and left everything important to the last minute. The car takes several seconds of displaying the logo before starting up, the turn signals do not turn off automatically and much more. The state of the modern car industry is so sad. Bring back cars instead of iPad's on wheels.
I was fully prepared for this vid to be more opportunities to take jabs at a fledgeling car company but you have surprised me with a critical but fair appraisal of the VF8. The US motoring press have been ruthless in their attack of the disruptive EV manufacturers with claims ranging from the totally valid to outright lies and misinformation.  I echo others requests to revisit the VF8 to see how well Vinfast has resolved issues; such features from new media such as yourselves is breath of fresh air away from the traditional media that are too closely tied to manufacturers advertising spend and out -of-date, out-of-touch reviewers who are writing for an audience that is rapidly dwindling. Keep up the great work.
you guys so STUPID about pedal test, let go to tesla and do the same test.
You know it’s bad when the manufacturer is paying their customers extra money _after_ buying their car.
Not agree with your review! You are not experience with car full enough before review. Most of guys have negative review here even not own or ever experience with car. Most of guy here is poor and say without experience on it just like sheep repeat without thinking.
If I get in my car in the morning and it needs a software update before I can drive it I’m throwing hands
Vietnam TP HCM vinfast vf5 vf6 vf7 vf8 vf9 ef34 ef35 ef36 iPhone15 samsung s23 5g google map YouTube
To be honest, I'm gonna give this video a thumb down button (negative vote). First of all, when you review a car, you did not even read the instruction or hire an official Vinfast guide to come with, and then give negative opinions even when you didn't know what exactly it is. Secondly, you guys used the city edition of VF8 to review, it's not the commercial version of the car so Vinfast has strongly announced that city version of VF8 still have some errors that need to be fix, you guys just ignored it and reviewed it by default version. LOL
Saw one for the first time today in SF
It can be confirmed that the entire design, including all parts, was purchased from China, Japan, and South Korea. Probably even production is in China, with only labeling and painting in Vietnam.
what???
Under damped not under dampened 🤦‍♂️
*and if you are a nice player, you should have a video to verify when the car has updated the software and everything is running fine now. they have fixed it completely*
Dog nuts Midia.  Que dramatics  Que antics  Que J ewe wish propaganda. The End
Gooooooodmooooooorning Shitnaaaaaam!!!
Mấy  thằng này cố tình dìm hàng ah
You can use a (modified) Blues Brothers quote for the chimes: "How often do the chimes go off?...So often you won't even notice!"
Right off the bat, a random Vietnamese car company I never heard of, selling cars for $50,000 - I will immediately never pay attention to the brand ever again. This should be like $25,000
That's what I can't stand about modern cars. Like modern people, they never shut up about themselves and everything's 'problematic'. It's like having a four-wheeled tamagotchi with NPD.
You are bitter because they won the wsr.😂
That's literally how the ID4 starts. you just sit down and go. You don't have to press anything to start
VF8 - F = V8  All these new generations electric garbage - minus - all the F’s (fuc* ups) = equals = old school V8  That’s why I just bought me a good’ol all American V8 Hemi Ram 1500 truck  Huge thanks to all awesome manufacturers who still make V8’s, may god bless you, and may you continue to make V8’s for the fans/customers/lovers of old school V8’s, always and forever, Amen!
Lmao, how much did Vinfast give you for the last few seconds of the video? XD
Honestly, the fact that is will not let you change lanes without the turn signal is great. I wish that all vehicles did that. It's really quite annoying, and very dangerous I might add, when you change lanes without signaling.
My sincere condolence to VinFast - cut the loss, park up shop, and GO BACK HOME!
There are many people who identify themselves as Vietnamese. But actually most of them are people who have chosen to betray their country for money. They fled Vietnam after 1975. Now they turn to hate Vietnam and all that originated in Vietnam. VinFast participated in the Los Angeles Auto Show 2022, they said it was a plaster car. When Vinfast cars run on the streets of Vietnam, they think that it is not qualified to run on American streets. When Vinfat rolls on the streets of America, they find ways to bring it down. They said it was a Chinese car and only had the Vietnamese logo. While Vinfast has a 4 billion USD factory in Hai Phong. And there are a lot of arguments they make to bring it down. Vinfast is a young company. So you won't be spared minor mistakes. Famous and long-standing electric car companies still appear errors. They will fix it, what they need is time.
channel has no expertise, it's like a dump
That happens when you drive the cars made by stupid  asia (except from japan)
Vietnam does not make something correct the first around.  They will fix some problems but never all.  They will also create more problems while not exactly fixing the original problems. Do not buy anything important from a completely Vietnamese company. Sorry, it’s just the culture.
I wanna see more!
Nguyening like Nguyens do in Vietnam. Money laundering Vietnam style
My guess with the reverse is that their sensors/camera were a bit off and it was detecting something behind them which would make the car "shudder" I guess.. but idk I don't trust most reviews these days.
Vinfast's owner here. Of course, Without blinkers you can still change lanes, you just need to use more force with the steering wheel.
Why rinky dinks countries keep on trying to make cars? Malaysia, India,China..all are junks..just copy toyotas and hondas already
it looks like a sh***y nissan juke
Who knows. Maybe they’ll fix their reputation like Kia did.
is the the vacation movie car?
Am I the only person who wish someone or every manufacture would make a car that is a simple as a 40 year old car, even a simple base model from each manufacturer.  Still having all the air bags, and emissions,  only having a heat on/ac on, fan low med low, medium and high, or a variable speed fan.  And a go pedal, a woah pedal,  a park pedal.  A simple speed meter.  And headlight switches, and a actual key to get it started. Along with a simple radio that can be easily replaced with a aftermarket unit,  why try to build a computer on wheels, with BCM where everything is controlled by a electronics box  just a fuse box, with current sensor in each circuit, to detect the bulb outage, having a potentiometer to be adjusted. To set the warning light, so different bulbs can be used,  and who would not want a new modern version of a 70 Chevelle, with Lt4,  or a new 70 C10 , with either 4.3 or LT1,  with 6 speed available in all. Plus a 70 Camaro  with the z28 with certain package available with the 5.5L Vette engine, and 7 speed manual, and AWD, with turbos!, Weigh about 3000 lbs,  making about 1090 HP, 985 TQ, and possibly adding port injection, and tuning on e85 get about 1800 HP,  a flat plane crank Camaro,  awesome 😎 👍
would you rather drive a yugo than this?
give em a second shot...
This is why you don't rush out a product. Entertaining video and kinda makes me want to do a test drive!
Idk if I would buy a car made in vietnam period... 'made in china' being trash is definitely a thing, but they are getting better at it pretty quickly. Vietnam though? Hard pass
That VB wrx at 5:06 tho 😗 🍑
Ford Fiesta... Ford Pinto....
Any new vehicle will have its problems, probably rushed the car to production too quick. That said if they take care of their customers that goes a long way. Time will tell
I think yawl are wussy
No car can be as bad as an kia
nice
I used to own a Winfast almost 25 years ago, of the TNT2 chip variety. Was a pretty sweet card, did Quake 3 high settings.
I wouldn’t touch this car with a 30 foot pole
Here I was, thinking Chinese cars would be the worst...
Funny comparing the car to video games 😂
yes , update pls
This channel has 7.9 millions subscribers and they think they have a right to do everything to make views and money. There are a lot of positive review from American publication about Vinfast VF8 for example from JD Power  (One of the most respectable car review in the USA) ....But they decide to publish only  bad comment.  A professional youtuber or a journalist must be fair and must show different point of view.
It’s a company copying Chinese cars which themselves copy the west, what makes you think it’s a good car? French cars can’t hold up with west standards, why do you think this will?
Your video is awesome.   they did not start making EV until 2021 and not 5-6 years ago like you said. But I concur with you here, the Vinfast VF8 is not a great car, short battery range and too pricey. People over in Vietnam reported so many problems with the car left and right.    Don't fall into their 10 yrs warranty trick, the warranty is only good as long the company is still around I bet if you live in the colder states, the battery is probably about 150 miles range.
I mean. If the Titan submersible can go deep sea exploring with some Dick’s Sporting Goods athletic tape, then this car should be seen as a total success until it drives someone off the road. Get that munnaaaaa—Too soon?
Imagine buying a new car with bugs, and those bugs causing a collision. I think I'll stick to used cars (or no car if possible)
How dare an electric car have the letter V and the number 8 in its name.  That's what's outraging me LOL
This is a prime example of why cars being made today are robots. The car’s computer has to much control over the driving experience
If I were all of you, I wouldn't bat an eye to Motortrend. All of the critics on MT are moronic and illiterate at best. I doubt they even know what a car is to begin with.
This is exactly why I hate newer cars. Driving assistance features that only the most incompetent drivers actually need.
Agree with you: EV's are trying too hard to be something else, just be a car, that's what we want. Concentrate more on perfecting existing technologies and refining them (ex: more efficient batteries) so that the costs come down. Right now, as things exist, given the prices of EV cars, the complete and total lack of any kind of national infrastructure (fast charging stations), the EV industry as a whole is a complete joke, and overpriced piece of fuc%ing sh!t. Oh, and somehow you have to increase energy output in this country two-fold within just a few more years if you are going to reach 100% EV's by 20whenever. Let's not even get into child slave labor cobalt mines. Screw the EV market. I'll keep driving my 2023 Hellcat Challenger for the next 20 years....
I love that it won't let you switch lanes unless you signal first. There are way too many people who cause accidents by merging without signaling, and it's ironic that an Asian vehicle would have such a feature.  Also, the unnecessary chimes is the equivalent of every Asian mom & aunt backseat driving while their kids/nieces/nephews are the ones actually driving (and I'm speaking from experience)
Give them a 2nd round chance. If is the same BS, then given a Knock Out punch.
A fancy chivichana!!
And all this time I thought you were bald ...man if I had a head of hair like that I’d be  cruisin the streets 24/7 ..... dump the baseball cap 🧢
Worse than a ford focus? I don’t know a single person who owns one that doesn’t have an absolutely fucked transmission. Ford is a prick about it too, not offering replacements.
socialism will NEVER produce ANYTHING nice bc fair competition is banned
Have you tried changing lanes in any modern car without a blinker? Every car with lane departure prevention does what you experienced.
Can't change lanes if you don't signal? AWESOME. Should be mandatory on all vehicles. lol
This comparison :D In a shit launched game like No Mans Sky no human can possibly die, but in this car I'm not that sure.
User experience on board of modern vehicles is terrible. Driving aids suck. Having to use the touch screen to adjust A/C is ridiculous (and dangerous) too. Car makers need to seriously reconsider UX and stop using a trillion sensors and chimes and whatnot that serve no purpose except marketing bullshit. Keep cars simple!
Damn glad it wasn’t mine
not even vietnamese people trust this car
@Donut  *Wow is your style of presentation annoying as heck....just like the Vinfast is.*
Please do a follow up video! I don’t have any particular interest in ever getting one of these cars, but I am curious to see if they really fixed these issues. ‘Cause the “you cant steer without using your blinkers” function definitely scares me cause like, what if you have to avoid a sudden object in the road? The car’s like “this is your captain speaking. There appears to be a runaway tire heading straight for us. Your previous captain attempted to avoid the runaway tire, but I believe we can just as easily run it over head on. My calculations suggest that its much safer to toss the vehicle in the air rather than swerve around it. So please fasten your seatbelts because we’re about to experience some major turbulence. Thank you for flying with Vinfast.” Like what the heck? 😆  Also your videos are amazing I love watching you guys! I watch you on Facebook all the time. 10/10 content!
Keep driving it til you hurl lol
sorry friend, I'm watching you evaluate VINFAST VF8. have you tried the car for 30 minutes??? and then rate it??? Those who have used it for half a year have no reviews like you. the first you see the start button takes more than 1 minute it doesn't have, the second turns on the turn signal with 2 modes you turn it on it blinks 3 times and then turns off by itself, or turns hard when the steering wheel goes straight it will turn off, Tuesday the bell The warning is near the line, it will warn if you turn on the turn signal it will not warn, or you run it automatically it doesn't warn or you don't want it to warn you can go into the settings to turn off the warning mode, 4th you said it accelerates and responds slowly, check again, I have not seen users of this car talk about this on Thursday, my friend, this car has shock absorbers because this car uses sports tires, on Friday you said you can't change the line, don't turn on the turn signal It's not true you can still change the line but it will be a bit heavy because of the support to steer and keep the line. In general, most of you do not understand and are not familiar with this car, so if you want to make an objective assessment, you should have a VINFAST technical staff with you to evaluate the product. If you do not understand, or deliberately do not understand, those reviews have no value, and even reduce your reputation.
Beginning, your attitude when reviewing this car has been in a negative direction. unprofessional and unfair
I think it's fairer for Vinfast if you use the car for a while before you do the review video, then at least you already know how to open the door and start the car. Or you can take a test drive to learn about the system's features. I find your video unbiased
The looks are not bad. But then you can buy a picture of it.
Well, Vượng Vin should hear this. Hire me or some other with passion of driving combined with great car knowledge we will show you how it should be done and explain each point of a great car, sport or leisure kne
If you're living in Vn and talk shit about Vinfast. You will be fucked really really hard 😂
American media is not reliable, not objective, bad. Although the youtube channel has millions of subscribers, the review is sketchy and emotional.
Thông qua video này và những bình luận từ các chiên da Mỹ, mình thấy họ giống như 5 ông mù đi xem voi. :)) The Worst Reviewer!
I don't know what you dislike about the laggy accelarator pedal. It's just like turbo on cars from the 80's  ;)
I don’t even understand why the car made to the US market. It’s an absolute crap. Where a Vietnamese corrupt businessman try to entrepreneur on international car manufacturing by paying up for permits and licenses. Just for his own pride
sorry but all EV'S are a joke
If only cars came with manuals on how to operate them through the internet or a physical book. If you dont like the turn signals dont drive a real hummer for the military where they dont self cancel at all. If you need driver assist for changing lanes, and know how to use mirrors you cant drive. EVs are gonna ride and be louder for efficiency to improve range.
How long does take to start the car.. Great question. How about reading the manual before attempting to drive it?
0:38 noo donut!! don't spell it VOLKSWAGON  James' "CARS ARE PAIN" hat is perfect for the "is that where we're at in our lives?" reverse test scene :)
12:38 y'all beat me to the joke
- isn’t the start-up the same as any Tesla out there? - Annoying chimes are a plague in every car nowadays  - as are unreliable driving “assistants” - the blinkers work, the reverse gear works, the battery works (the clip looked more like a software error, tbh)  So in the end it’s just another ugly SUV with harsh driving properties, like there are too many out there already.  What’s the fuzz about?!
All these problems and they have the audacity to charge $50,000 for this hunk of junk? Sure, Jan. 🙄
channel about cars but don't know anything about technology, only stupid people will believe what you say 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
did you learn about vinfast before talking about these issues? so stupid
More-ons reviewing a car. What idiots. Not funny. If you’re not funny. Don’t try to be funny.
your youtube channel is quite big but your brain is too small and saying untrue and untrue things your audience must be brainwashed
My father used to say: the more gadgets and automation a car has, the more things there are to go wrong. That has stuck with me my entire adult life when considering an auto purchase.The most reliable car I've ever had was an 87 manual A Honda Accord that didn't even come with a passenger mirror or stereo. Yeah, I'm that old.The only thing that failed on that car were the CV joints well after 100k on the odometer. And being that I was a teenager that thought burnouts were cool in a front when drive car, I'd say it held up pretty well.
Never heard of it!
To turn it on, Tesla has a similar startup sequence - Step on the Brake. Regarding other things, it is a software issue as long as the system has enough controls and sensors to fix it. I have used a Tesla for 3 years and have been in the automotive industry for 45 years.  Like Tesla, Vinfast will need some time to correct and improve.
Its designed like a modern American car, flashy and nothing but gimmicks built to be repaired over and over then thrown away.
7:15 Okay that random arm coming out of the dark scared me wtf
why is this edited by a hyperactive 12 year old
Đẹp
You guys made this video just for money, very disappointing :(
I bought my wife a new r line atlas and that thing never shuts the fuck up. Even my new kia sportage is the same. I think its just new cars that always chirp at you. It's why my insurance is lower for a 23 r line atlas then it was for a 2017 gmc terrain
Give it another shot if its updated.  But I don't know how they plan to fix overall ride quality.
Perfect gift car for mother-in-laws! 😂
he said cyberpunk was rushed lol
Blinkers not on, dangerous correction move.
With the exception of what is produced by Japanese and South Korean brands, everything else that comes from Asia is third-quality material. this car is not worth half the price they ask for it.
If a car is all electronic, expect all the little annoyances that happen with any electronic device. The Ford Escape has a hybrid in 2023 and it is so much better.
I do appreciate that it won't let you change lanes unless you turn your signals on. This feature needs to be mandatory cause there are a lot of bad driving habits out there
thats a trash copy of Renault
Anybody remember the Yugo?
Vin slow
“Death battery” The sport mode ready all right okay 3.2.1 go then embarrassing part oh car broke it s*** the car is broken.
It’s pretty off putting how the speedometer is in the middle of the car and there’s just blank space where it should be. I like having the speedometer right in front of me when I drive.
May be the worst one than the model 3
Coming from a country with no real car industry, where car ownership has traditionally been relatively low and putting it on the North American market, whilst making it look quite stylish within a very short time span still is quite admirable. Hopefully they will learn from the mistakes and iron out the bugs.
Drive the car. Get a check. 😂
Buy this car. Then contact a therapist after having to drive it. 😂
as a Vietnamese, I'm ashamed of our businessmens
You guys didn't know enough about the car's manual, how to start and how the car works.  so the new boot takes up to 1p8s.  with t only 15 seconds is done
Would love to see a second review. We need more upstarts in the market, and it would be nice to see them deliver on their promises.
I could understand if the vehicle sold at a low price but not at 50k for a car obviously made on the cheap. It even follows the tesla 3's worst feature of no driver instrument cluster and the vehicle seats just seem uncomfortable (of course it could just be from the test drivers weight issues - not trying to be mean just objective).
Never heard of it. Lucky me
Ironically, because of how damn sensitive the sensors are, Vinfast may have created some of the best sensors in the industry 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who is willing to spend over $50,000 for a not depend able vehicle.
I really liked this review. The only part I dislike about electric car reviews that happened in this video specifically is when a manufacturer says they'll fix things with a software update. Comparing this car to early video game releases seems problematic in that vein. A video game has zero chances of harming me or people around me, a video game is also entirely made of software. This car is not made entirely of software, it's made of many hundreds if not thousands of individual components and no manufacturer should ever get to slide on faults with "we'll fix it with a software update". Much like the Chevy Bolt battery, they attempted to fix it with "software" and failed because the failure was entirely physical, waiting for the real fix to come (in the form of a recall of the part) people lost cars and had homes catch on fire. The lack of acceleration, the faulty driver assist, could all be down to using faulty or inferior hardware but are brushed away as software by the manufacturer. Even the lack of a stop/start button might seem trivial but it seems like a cost cutting measure more than a convenience thing. It's also not intuitive as you've shown in the video, in a world where people confuse the gas peddal and brake peddal and harm people because of that, having a clear and visible start/stop button is just sensible.
$50k??!?! $25k max for the fully loaded spec... ill wait for the Chinese EVs to make the switch.
I just want the electric cars of the future to be as cool as the PowerWheels Jeeps of my youth…. And by that I mean easily modified with a screwdriver, some jumper cables and an extra battery. We had the fastest one on the block until my buddy’s mom found out 😂
30k will be a nice price tag.
Question is: why did someone buy this car without a test drive? Do you not have test drives at US dealerships?
Goddamn you guys just gave us Vietnamese actual reasons to hate this car. Since the start peoples have been shitting on this without any base. They all just like "Because is Made in Vietnam so it's bad" "The Chairman has bad history so the car is bad" " It's electric so it bad" etc.
A modern car is an absolutely complicated machine that will take years to master. Giving it's a fairly new company you can understand why quality is just not there. I wish them luck with those prices
A 50K crap mobile
weres the pop pop pop head lights
If this video is made by Vietnamese, they will be considered unpatriotic or maybe the police will come to visit their home. LOL
Just like Hyundai ten years ago.
You can turn all those chimes and such off in the settings
WOW.... 3.4M views in 5 days. What a "HOT" car!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Always READ the User's Manual BEFORE trying to drive the vehicle.🤷🏼‍♂️  If I was looking for an electric/battery car this one wouldn't be on the list...
who spent 50k on a Vietnamese car. I want to see their faces. 😅😅  kidding. ..
A car that starts unconventionally should actually be pretty cool since itll be harder to steal
Nein,Nein,Nein das ist Not Gut, $50K for a toy that barely works??? Haiya and since when Vietnam is producing cars??? These cars are designed to kill Mericans for revenge as we all know,,Revenge best served Cold… 😂😂😂
Vingroup - Vinfast was bad big company in VietNam. I'm living at VietNam, I knew all about them. Their new model VF3, VF5, VF7, VF9 were VFe34 and VF8 clone. It's all, had the same problems. There's worst cars, y' know
HOW FAST IS YOUR VIN NUMBER GONNA BE OBSOLETE WHEN IT WON'T RUN...?
I think it's pretty amazing they offer a 10 year/ 125k warranty bumper to bumper That's pretty unheard of
be careful, Vinfast once called the police when a Vietnamese Youtuber posted a bad review video about the car😱
i clicked on this video vinfast
Worthwhile noting these problems pale compared to the first Model S's.
Nice car
Would make a lot more sense if it was considerable cheaper than the competition, that's the only reason I can see to buy a car from a brand new manufacturer.
Driving a car should feel like and extension of your body. The design should be standard and intuitive. Doing things differently just to do things differently and not improving anything is a recipe for disaster. This doubly applies to a mid range suv, which applies to the widest demographic of people.
more
Customer is the Quality control (again).  !@#$%^&* !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Junk . Return to original country.
Not defending these problems in any way, but remove the “start-up sequence” issue completely.  Why?  Because Tesla, for one, and there are a few other makes/models out there that have weird “start-up sequences” and the destructions on how-to are right in the manual.  Apparently the first complaint stems from no one being bothered to read the damn book in the glove box; or likely in this scenario, right in that ridiculous screen in the center of the dash… 😂
Call me crazy but a video game having bugs is one thing, a vehicle having bugs that could cause a wreck is another and totally unacceptable.
Let's be honest here.  I think the only reason Vinfast is in the US is cuz we're having a cold war/trade war with China so we don't want cool competitors like NIO, BYDs, and MGs over here competing and taking over so we're importing these pho mobiles 😂
dang. not like this idea is stolen or anything
vinfast bringing the AAA game sales strategy to the car market Release an unfinished mess first fix glitches and bugs later
Am I the only one who thinks that logo looks straight out of GTA?
I liked the " reinventing the wheel "comment " ;Too many goofy ideas too fast here. The car needs to drive like a car so any licensed driver can just drive it. I'm pretty sure most of these things can be resolved with software updates at this point because it involves simply disabling the annoyances. Yes this car does seem to have been launched to the U.S. market too early  and I am amazed it got past D.O.T. reg.s  even for testing on open roads here.   To be fair, give them some time to fix the drivability issues; and then we can all rip on build quality. 50,000? Nope not my Dollars.
I rented a Nissan that wouldn't stop chiming.  Every time it gained or lost lane markings, it chimed. Using radar cruise and it chimed at 22mph, then chimed again at 3mph. No idea what it was trying to tell me.  That and it had some stupid thing where if you had lanekeeping turned on but NOT propilot, it would use your BRAKES to keep you in your lane rather than the steering wheel.
very good way to launder
If BMW payed for their cars type 1,2 and 3 problems, I would be well off.
Stupid people buy this vietnamese communist  vinfast EV.   Which of communist do you not understand ??? lol
Nope, enough with the spaceships, make the car easy and comfortable to drive.
Modern electric cars are garbage. What happened to having physical buttons for things? Shouldn't have to wrestle with a glorified smart phone/tablet to turn on/off basic car features.  This is why it's probably better to just find a junker with a bad engine and just pay someone to convert it into an electric car. It would have all the classic stuff older cars have but be electric. No subscriptions for basic features, no potentionally life threatening self driving malfunctions, no dodgy firmware updates. Just a car that does what cars need to do....drive you to your ***king destination.  This crap is really holding the industry back. I hope some big car company finally gets their head out of their ass and make a decent basic EV that just focuses on being a good car and not have a bunch of smart phone/tablet bulls**** happening with it's center console. :P  Oh and it shouldn't cost 20k to replace the ***king battery. Make it easily removable/repairable. People like to claim they break down less often because of simpilar design compared to internal combustion cars, but if your EV breaks down for someone reason and it's out of warranty...it's basically totaled. Most EVs are a hellscape of proprietary parts that no third party sells and you have to pay an arm and a leg to have the manufacture replace for you. It's disgusting. That recent viral video of someone blowing up their Tesla because replacing the battery cost more the car is worth is prime example of this bulls***t.  Look if they want to make luxery EVs with all the smart driving BS go right on ahead but they need to provide an economy version that focuses more on basic car stuff so those who don't care about that crap have options.
Do your microphones not work in the VinFast?
My dog itch
If they wanted to be competitive they should bring the price down so a retired person can buy it.
Are these guys from Oklahoma?
You know when a video game launches with a bunch of problems it's an inconvenience it downright sucks but you're not going to die or suffer injury and he didn't just punk her down 50 to what 40,000 if you get some government assistance on the purchase. It's wild that you can release a car so fast with so many problems like what the hell I thought we had regulations in place. This car should not be on the road Just one case of a battery dying that should have stalled out the whole thing and prompted another 10 years of research and development. Like cars die but they don't just brick on a road like that even if you blow your engine you can usually get to a shoulder on the highway or hopefully you're buying an exit a ramp and you can get down and out of the way. Heck I got a string of hoopties and downright shitty cars when I was in high school $500 or cheaper cars that you were always wrenching on and I had one that I was on the i-90 doing about 80 mph cuz that highways crazy coming back from Austin Minnesota and the engine blew or something blue on the car literally heard a pop started losing speed but at my speed I was able to get it off the highway on the next ram which was on the outskirts of a town and with my speed I was able to safely get it into the parking lot of a store. I explained to the manager what happened they were nice enough it is Minnesota so but they were nice enough to let me keep it there for the weekend since it was out of the way it was kind of the beginning of the parking lot away from the store so it wasn't interfering and I was able to make plans and get it towed home the next day or whatever we did it. I can't believe how much more scared I would have been and maybe even died if a car just shut off on the highway wasn't able to get it on to a shoulder or anything let me have literally would have to get out of the car if it would let me maybe the doors don't even open at that point So you're just sitting there waiting for someone not paying attention hitting you at 80 to 90 mph and you're dead.
Muricans that are not happy with sub par quality... suddenly forgot all Murican car brands i guess...
rip , trash car
Im a simple man. Just give me my damn key and an ignition switch to let me go vroom.
Volkswagon?... never heard of that one, before.
"In hindsight it's pretty intuitive" That isn't what intuitive means...  That said, the fact they're sticking a $50,000 price tag on this thing that seems to be riddled with issues, some of them severe, is not good at all.  I wish them the best, but I don't have much faith in a company that can't get suspension right.  Yikes.
I thought this was going to be the next "affordable" car brand similar to how Kia/Hyundai used to be many years back, then you mentioned it's $50k...
maybe if you stayed in between the lines of the lanes you wouldn't be getting so many chimes. You do realize that you can turn off lane assist instead of trying to make the car look bad.
as a person who had the incredible pleasure of being a passenger in an old russian car a few times I'll say that's not that bad, at least you have functioning blinks and a suspension  tho that old russian car costed like 500$ not 50k$
i like the comparison to no mans sky or cyberpunk cuz not only did they get most of their game-breaking bugs worked out, they became at least decent games which are mostly worth playing, and i think its entirely possible (albeit unlikely) that Vinfast could improve to that same degree
50.000 for a car with that many issues is wyld they rather shouldve made a contract with Seat or Skoda and let them build a car and become a sister company of them and then push own developments into this... but damn
"if it aint broke, dont fix it". The plight of modern cars.
50k?? Might as well get a scatpack
Great video. I live in Việt Nam and with a 200% import tax on foreign cars coupled with the pride of having a Vietnamese produced car, they completely dominate the EV market here. Plus VinGroup are a massive conglomerate here too.
the full price of my Renault Zoe (EV) was 27 000€ when new, current price is 30 000€. It's weird how much bang for your buck you get for that. Controls are super-simple and dashboard is full of manual buttons, which is amazing. You can change the AC or music source and stuff without looking. It has no lane assists, doesn't need it. It has no rearview camera, it has windows that provide good visibility.
Follow-up - yes!
Wow! Can't wait to not ever buy one!
I think they should give me 10 for a life sized slot car track. And a $1,000,000 Budget.
Somehow it wasn’t a Hyundai. That’s just impressive, to be worse than them
It's their own fault for not test-driving before they buy. And for being a self-righteous moron and spending $50,000 on a crappy electric car to virtue signal.  You thought you were saving the world but you didn't save anything. You just got sick in your douchemobile.
Btw, how much did they pay u for this?
“This is the Vinfast VF8” Cool “It’s an electric SUV” Just give me a challenger Hellcat.
I’m in a rental car this week while mine is in the shop and the “driving aids” are SUPER ANNOYING! It’s a 2022 Toyota, actually a really nice car overall but I spend 5 minutes turning off systems so I can have manual control over the thing and it STILL does this “lane centering” thing and beeps at me whenever I so much as graze a line on the road. Very bothersome when I know I’m trying to avoid a deep puddle or a landscaping trailer and the car tries to “correct” me 😂
Vidoes less than 15min and filled with content are great.
I now live in a world where cars suck at launch because of half-baked software and "we'll fix it in an update" is acceptable and isn't the death knell for the company. I guess the disease the videogame industry has been suffering from is contagious.
Letting all these foreigner cars in America and thats how we lost great cars like OLDSMOBILE SATURN PLYMOUTH PONTIAC MERCURY and almost CHRYSLER. SMH. We lost our way when it to cars.
How much bribe money are you guys getting because that company bribed almost all car enthusiasts.
This couldve been a 4 minute video
Software upgrade is code for "it doesn't work correctly yet but it will I promise so give me money now."
It's very arrogant and reckless to include advanced features like hazard alerts and steering assistance when they aren't executed properly.
One hundred dollar or a couple hundred won’t replace a bad set of struts.  It’s not even enough to pay someone the time to do the work.  That’s a bad compensation.  At least do a manufacturer recall and fix it free of charge.
In all fairness the first versions of the Hyundai Excell, Toyota Corolla and the Honda CVCC (Civic) cars to arrive in the US all had issues which took years  to fix or improve. VIN is probably trying to follow their example and get a toe hold into the American market.
It would have been smart of them to just make something like a super simple electric kei truck or kei car, no futuristic stuff all economical. Would probably sell better, but who knows.
All EV'S  Are junk in my opinion. I don't  care who built it.  These are basically golf karts. And are junk golf karts at best.  Buy a hybrid instead. Or just keep your old internal combustion ride.  Don't be stupid sheeple.
They all looks like a software patch , expect for suspension namaste
Vinfast is a Vietnamese company…that’s enough for me to stop right there. Not to discriminate all Vietnamese companies, they make great pho, just not cars😂
the chimes gave me PTSD flashbacks of driving a 2020 volvo VNL thru missouri backroads delivering supplies to small town butchers. the narrow roads had the cab relentlessly bitching at me that im crossing lines
Cyberpunk 2077 was so bad that even in 10 years in development, which was claimed by the company, was still  titled the worst game of all time
Legit, started it faster than I started my rented model 3.   But that's because the stupid thing turned my phone into it's key and then when we were out of cell service it refused to authenticate and start.
I used to live in Hanoi, Vietnam. Lots of Vietnamese people have VinFasts. There was a running joke among my Vietnamese friends that had them that you could only drive them in Hanoi because if you dared to take them to the countryside, you'd never make it back to Hanoi.
its a bummer because that car is nice!
They’re building the factory for these things less than 20 min from me. We gave away the farm to get a car factory in this area, and we look ridiculous.
I'm curious as to why "Sunroof" was an option on the whiteboard but was later taken down? What it camera gear suctioned to the sunroof that made it non testable? 😅
This car is like 30k car... 50k i a lot.
Nissan cars sucked badly for a few years after they arrived in North America as well.  Great cars now, though.
$50k to see if the updates fix the bugs lol…no. Why? Because you can get a used Tesla for the same amount with a better track record
Bully ….. 😢😢😢
5:27 Blind spot monitoring systems do not function at low speeds.  Other manufacturer's manuals state minimum speeds ranging from 19 mph to 30 mph.
Excuse me, but did this design evolve from someone drawing a Renault from memory?
I proud of this car, because its the best car in my country:). Vietnam FOREVER
how about an actual review and not a quick drive down the highway and then judge  oh well this seemed to work this one time.
garbage car
Sounds like this vinfast car should be in the junkyard, I never heard of it and thanks to this video I would never give this car the time of day, it sounds like a serious waste of money
here's what I'd like a company like VinFast to do: you don't have the budget to thoroughly test a car.  so create "Alpha" and "Beta" buyer's programs.  "sell" the car for half price, with the full disclaimer that "shit ain't perfect yet, and you're doing real world testing for us. expect this thing to die at some point, for us to maybe fix it eventually, but you might be without it for an indeterminate period of time."  basically full Caveat Emptor.  then at the end of your A/B testing programs, offer to trade in the A&B cars for a production one, with full paid value applied towards the new production special edition (aka, badged and interior'ed) copy.  I'd be willing to wager that your conversion rate from A/B is high enough.
I feel like this show is getting dumber and dumber. Like literally< you gotta press brake and select drive on VW iD4, Tesla, and I think Lucid as well.... Cmon guys, I love you, but don't be kooks
You just shattered a rich man's dream. Thganks for the honest reviews. Any chance you will review donut since the channel is Donut?
I've never seen anyone click on the gas pedal like a madman! you guys are trash reviews
You can't fix shitty suspension with a software update......................
Bugs in a videogame aren't dangerous. That car being sold should be illegal
You can’t change the lane without turning on the BLINKER? - BMW DRIVERS BIGGEST NIGHTMARE 😄
I think it's interesting that a new company from Vietnam has entered the market; I want them to do well, but it will certainly take time.
Maybe they can add some extra lives to the contract.
Good luck to Vietnam, I would look at buying one here in NZ, but we are such a small market, why would they bother! These things are easily fixed!
and they want 50k for this car? Damn
Was forced to write possitive reviews about this car.  Never spend money on this brand if you care about safety.
The name Vinfast sounds really tacky especially because “VIN” is already a very specific word in the automotive dictionary
for American drivers i think those chimes are needed
Never pay for this car.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY Americans are so infasinated with foreign car junk. I AM 78 YRS OLD and bought G.M. all my life , with great results.
JD Power and  The Detroit Channel are among  the most Respectable Car Review in the USA made positive review about the Vinfast VF8 so why should I believe your test drive. ? Could you show me ? Thanks.
Who in the right mind would pay 50k for this car, even if it worked?
I know people that went to work for Vinfast. They told me horror stories of working with Vinfast in Vietnam. I have been contacted by Vinfast several times to work for them.  Even Foreigners need to follow blindly what their Vietnamese boss tells them to do, even when it is completely wrong. Otherwise they will be fired.  Far worse than working with Chinese managers in the China.
No one knows how to make cars like america... right?.
Are the core components of these cars also made in Vietnam?  How much of this car is actually from other Asian countries that have their own EV line?
Tesla is best for electric in the world
Communist cars
Communist vehicles are and will always be shit! China, Vietnam, Russia doesn't matter. It's all garbage
Why did they skip the Rolling section
For 5 yr old co.. They've nailed the design .... Even the interiors look good
It's how Kia started out. So many problems and lemon cars. Now look at them! Crappy in a different way.
Damn, talk about paid promotion.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now at the point where “release it now, fix it later” is being applied to cars. Jesus christ.
these reviewer got paid by the other car company to make the car look bad .its business every company competing with each other.just like in the movies .
The dislike is for the thumbnail
This is why I love my shitbox
Is it me or this car look like the Dacia Sandero
Vinfast Should recall all sold cars and suspend all new car selling  ,fixed all issues before the car kill passenger, than sell again
I remember the launch of this brand and they were dead serious about dethroning Tesla and a dozen Chinese companies like BYD. Looks like an absolute joke now.
越南的汽车工业刚刚起步 可能五年十年之后越南会做出不错的车
in VIETNAM they claim Vinfast will beat Tesla on US soil. 😂😂
For 50k I'd rather buy Ioniq 5 EV than VF. Sell the VF for 10k, then I'll consider it.
"In hindsight its pretty intuitive". Well if someone cant figure out how to start a car for over one minute its definitely not intuitive
I clicked and a Jaguar advert came up 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me: Ye ima buy a vinfast because its cheap. Also me after watching: Fuck this shit i’m out.
Vinshit
Haha these jerks borrow that car from someone, talk shit about it, and stomp on the accelerator pedal repeatedly. I get once or twice to show the lag, but that was just disrespectful.
How long before a Chevrolet badge get put on them
Interesting. I've never heard of this car.
"It's like a bad roommate!" lmao
ahaha, its not Volkswagon, its Volksvagin! Silly Donut, cant even spell!
Imagine this in driving games!  Nobody would select it!
The presenters are even more annoying than the car....
The vast majority of EV makers in the world are Chinese.  Hardly any are sold in the USA.  Vinfast is trying to get there first, they're nowhere near the capability or quality of the Chinese cars.  The US will not be a competitive market for EVs unless things improve with China and the Chinese companies enter the US market.  Mexico will have better cars.
i think you guys are racist and being too harsh because it was chinese car, it wasn't that bad and it looks great.  better than most car available in the market.
Vinfast is German BMW based and Italian Pininfarina styled with many high tech features.
The problem is not the shitty car (minus all the unsafe aspects), it's the price. 50k is a helluva a lot of car, even for an EV
God, the editing on this video is so obtrusive and annoying I’m writing a comment about it. Jesus. You made me do this.
0:38  what is volkswaGON?
Never buying an electric car and definitely not buying a POS like this.
imagine ur driving down the highway and out of nowhere somethings stopped in front of you, the car really doesn’t let you turn without a blinker on?
Vinfast 🤮What a shame , so blatant and so obvious how this  car represents the pathetic  individualistic, wasteful , gambling and bubble economics system addiction from the Oligarchs school of the west.. These Oligarchs such as this Vin Group are from the same roots that grew  to power after the end of the Cold War ; the same who funded and  brought us the Putins and George Bush of the world ,  from the Judeo Christian Elite of the West and  now the Asian Oligarchs of the East. A billionaire Oligarch is not so  different  from one another no matter where . Whether  it be  in the west to the east or to the  very ones who created the political economic mess and now war in Ukraine . Or to the Oligarch who owns this car company from Vietnam  . No difference at all!  Unless your government dare keep them in check with a more  multipolar  balanced societal approach such as in China (look at Jack Ma as an example) . Yes this Vinfast group is a direct beneficiary of the fall of the Soviet Union and like the many Judeo Christian bankers and swindlers who escaped to the west or rose in Ukraine and Russia ; his history is not that different.  I want all you few intelligent intellectuals and  also  many car enthusiasts  to ask your self why the hell is a Vietnamese Oligarch trying to mass produce / market an Electric car? When Vietnam itself doesn’t even have a car factory ; nor a road infrastructure for cars,  let alone any charging stations at ALL !Zero! Can you say Mopeds and motor bike traffic from hell! 🔥🛵🔥🔥 Then ask  , does Vietnam even have a network of public Metro Rail system comparable to the phenomenal  metro networks in China ,Thailand ; Singapore; South Korea; Japan  ? The answer is a resounding No No No , So why an EV car ? Clearly Vietnam has learned nothing from its neighbors and learned the worse from its own capitalist wallets of  oligarchs  and overseas western subjugators . Vinfast = pathetic waste  🤮   And Rise of Oligarchs =  and look at Ukraine!  🤮 Vietnam stop fearing sanctions and unite with one China and move forward already stop these Oligarchs and invest in your people and infrastructure ! Return to filial piety and the Confucius and  Buddhists Values and a Constitution! Learn from the amazing Thailand!
The vinfast sedans I’ve seen in Vietnam look way cooler than these SUVs
If this car was 15,000 it would sort of make sense, but that blink steering issue is a hard no.
vietnamese products are bad, japanese products are much better
This is a shameless ad
🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😀😀😀🤣🤣😅
Most the parts probably are just cheap chinese shits putting together.
I’m probably not alone when I state I will never buy an electric passenger vehicle. That said, it’s amazing that a company would spend so much $ and time only to release a pile of 💩 almost nobody will actually buy. Honestly, when I see someone driving an electric car, I immediately wonder if they work for the manufacturer, a car reviewer, or if they’re just mentally disabled.
didn't Sandy Munro's team work with this company? maybe you can ask them about it
To expensive to be a gunny pig.
This is what you get for trusting Vietnam to build a car.
Ive had my Vinfast for 12 years and it's never had any issues.
That car is trash
Forget the car, this video should be the most negatively reviewed. Why tf are you filming on a fishbowl lens
is it Chinese brand?
50k? - yeah right :)  All the annoying check points should have never made it through to final production, however, that isn't even my main concern.  Disabling critical functions like turning without the blinker activated, or a laggy accelerator actuation, has serious safety implications.  Nevertheless, I may be a little biased as I have just retired from a major automobile company (one of the big 3) after 30+ years as a product test engineer.
make the vimfast good next mission!
I agree completely about them making cars so complicating. The older cars are actually more reliable in some ways because less parts you have means less parts that will fail.
Disappointing. I drove a Vinfast 1.4T in Vietnam. I liked it and it was a really good-looking car. Quality seemed on par with a KIA. It was an ICE engine, not an EV, and it seemed to handle and ride just fine on Vietnamese roads.   When I heard they were being imported I was curious, maybe even interested, but I'm not an EV fan for one, and not a fan of glitches, drive ability, or safety issues either.
Those 1k dislikes are from the Vinfast fanbase for sure 😂
That's junk of a car you can ever own....
If you have $50,000 to buy a car and you buy this, you may qualify to ride the short bus.
This is one of the  reasons why there is so many accidents on our roads , the modern cars have so many attention distractions now . I agree  with others .  in an emergency  trying to avoid an accident or a child on the road you will not have time to put on your blinker .  That car is a rolling death machine  and should be banned . Where is the Government safety standards . Ralph Nader would be horrified .  Also you have to understand that testing one car will not give much idea of the whole overall quality control of a batch of vehicles . Also the fact that they will pay you an amount while  the car is  being fixed might negate any redress under  consumer laws .
your pedal throte acts is very stupid, why you acceleration by press and not press the pedal?
Vietnam do bad cars long time!
It's not even that different, you just skip the start stop button. Or turning the key. Turn signal is normal, haven't been in a car that turns it off on a lane change. The chiming is annoying but I think you can turn it off and it definitely helps newer drivers. They really need to fix the suspension though. Especially because the Citroen c4 electric exists.
I have a great way to fix all these annoying EV issues ..... Its xalled a combustion engine 😂
The Yugo grows up. And gets worse!
Software updates won't fix a shaky ride that makes you sick
Why do you have to mock American   there are other states that you can mock
Broken on release? Day one patch? Seasons? DLC packs? Cars as a service? Fuuuuck that. The video game comparison was too close to home.
Majority of the negative comments are from those overseas Vietnamese generations that fled from Vietnam back in 1975, they resent everything from 'Communist Vietnam' due to their history. 🤣
Why?
This car is piece of S**t…sorry but not sorry.  I’m Vietnamese too but will not support this junk.
Họ gọi nó là xe tăng.bạn hãy thử va chạm đi.xem mức độ bảo vệ con người như nào
Why do the people of the US let 2 guys with future faces who are Welfare Homeless from the US go and run electric cars? Is the USA today too much Welfare Homeless, so many names with the face of Welfare Homeless have become famous characters in the social networking community.
As a Vietnamese people, I proud of... your Video instead of the car😂
Yes, i think they're deserving of an update on their VF8.
Ive rather had to buy a Mustang Mach-E. At least you get your moneys worth. I think they just push it to production too early. instead of taking time for testing phase. half bake in short.
Avoid vietcong car at all cost 😂
Was I the only one that thought Vin Diesel started a car company?
They bought it out too early, but I wish Vinfast every success
It really does sound like "Natalie Ly" is an agent from VinFast 😂
imagine buying a Vietnamese car
Imagine someone tailgating in one of those, or worse yet, imagine going around a construction in one of those, you can only be in one lane I bet.
They definitely tried doe, won’t be surprised if they failed. To go into the biggest car market ain’t easy.
Fuck that electric shit
Imagin the battery dying on the highway.
Lol. This Vietnamese car maker definitely seized the opportunity created by the sinophobic government. Props to him.
Cheap Dog Donut 😂
They changed the sunroof to drive aid 😅
"We've been making cars for over 100 years, just make it work like a car..." Laughs in Model A
😲😲
"Vietnamese car company"  is all you need to say.
What about that Sunroof?
Can we get a segment on reddit builds of cheap cars?
10:22 _"On the fourth day, I'll start giving you  $100.00."_ You forgot about the $300 per Type 2 issue. It works out to $300 for the first 3 days, then $100/day.
So emergency evasive maneuvers to say dodge an incoming semi, or avoid a small child result in the car fighting your wheel movements to force you to hit the kid. Thanks Vinfast.
50k lmfao
Give it another shot. Hope for the best (even if we expect the worst)
The new Yugo
Buying this car or any car from China is not going to be a good idea if you value your life.
We all know who this car was made for..
I have the feeling that they are having what a lot of Asian car companies that try to do a very complex programming task using people that do not use the product. I have had companies in Asia totally screw up the software as they hire people with very high degrees but do not own the product. In this case own a car.   I had a case of car speakers made in Korea and the customers were blowing them up and in North America. I was the person in charge of the warranty department and QC.  The company said they had brilliant people designing the product. They tested with very loud music. Cannone in the 1812 Overture.   This was in the mid 1980s.. They sent an engineer to out office in Vancouver. That day we were replacing the speakers in a young lady's Mustang. We were taking out hers and putting in some JBLs.  I took the Asian engineer to the car. and asked him to play his cassette and show me the volume. I listened for a few seconds znd stopped his demo. I fund the young lady's Led Zeppelin 2 tape and slammed that it in cranked the system into clipping.  To 11 so to say.  He leaped out of car shouting "You people crazy".. But the next batch of speakers did not blow up within an hour of new.  Apparently, on the way to the airport he bought several copies of Led Zeppelin 2.   My point of telling you this is that this story car shows all the symptoms of having the lead software designer not being a car owner themselves. That the while the speaker company tested with classical music instead of heavy metal it appears they were doing the engineering Asian style. Where the lead guy almost never touches the product. .That they do everything from theory. And they did it in a big rush. Using a team of people who also do not own cars doing their testing and reporting to someone only driving a desk.  Now they have to go through decades of product improvement very fast. Most of these look to me to be software issues and a poor choice of spring rates and shocks. I am not saying they are stupid. But I often see the attitude with the bosses there that they believe their testers are just being too picky.  Now that the reviewers here are figuratively handing them their asses, they will fix these issues.  But because of this, there will be some really bad reviews on their cars that will not go away. This will badly impact their sales in North America.   Toyota seemed to go through the same thing with the Toyopet in the 1950s where they did not test it properly and had to pull out of the US market for like a decade.  My feeling is that the will essentially catch up with these issues as they are not insurmountable. But they have to undercit the Tesla 3 on price to have any hope of good sales.
Ok, the part about not letting you change lanes without using blinker.. I'm gonna say WELL DONE. Can't stand people not using their turn signals.
will try give them a chance but not with that price
what a joke, no thank you
The car is made by pho chef
It’s a drive AIDS, not aids lol
Funny thing is the chimes was still there even after they stop counting. Just steer away from this rubbish please everyone 😂
well kia had issues for a long time, took them decades to make decent cars.
You guys should come to Puerto Rico and hang around the people who build Rotary Engines. Puerto Rico is crazy about Rotaries. You can see crazy stuff
The first time I saw one of these I thought it was one of the Cupra SUV’s or the Drako SUV
I can't make it through this.  It's a good video but I'm so burned out on electric crap.  I know some fanbois love them, but I have zero interest.
Why not fire the corporate team and hire people who'll get the job done right the first time?
I'm wondering if the type 1, 2, and 3 payments are direct translations to VND currency, cause if they reimbursed someone 2.3 million in Vietnam, that customer might not be very upset as long as the car is fixed.
Where did the point Sunroof go?
Never heard of VinFast, but still kinda pricey. I like the new EV Chinese cars instead, there very nice looking.
I can’t imagine trying to perform an evasive maneuver and being forced into a crash because I didn’t turn my blinker on in the panic to not get creamed!
Cars should only beep when ABSOLUTELY FQNK NECESSARY.  Do you hear me, every car manufacturer on the planet.  We don’t want your GOD DAMN FKN BEEPs!!!
It’s funny how every cars passing you on the highway looks so stable like there’s no reason for your car to wobble this way.  I feel exactly the other way in mine, when I pass regular cars wobbling and doing strange things, while I’m like 40kph more feeling like I’m sitting at my bureau 😂😂
Yeee, except cyberpunk was $60.
It's like a modern day electric Yugo.
50 grand 😂
Vinfast is amazing, drove one in Asia.  Sexyyyyyy  Fake media paid by car companies scared of Vinfast coming to usa spacing fake videos.
Vinfast is amazing, I own a BMW i8 and a Tesla S model and the Vinfast for the price is literally the best value for any car.  This video is probably paid car company to try to not make Vinfast popular in the usa.  Fake Media is fake Media.
Lha kui mengko nek yamaha ketemu meneh bmw yo ngelu.... Haha ndi tak delok cino ndi dll ndi tak delok
ah yes, car industry doesn't differ from videogame industry that much anymore
Yes do a follow-up
pressing drive to get it to move is not that uncommon.
First time we get to see James' hair...
who in his right mind would ever buy an electric car 🤣 has to be so embarrassing to drive
Give it another try. Say in a year or two. Suggest (me), the guy who only knows how to drive a car.
Why should I buy something that is unkown to me.  I just stick to something I already know if I were to spend $50,000, that's a lot of money to buy something I don't know.
Rember that one time they said they would make each car a bitcoin factory or some shit
What happened to the sunroof? You guys didn't test the rolling :( Where's the continuity
That's what we need...a commie car engineered by commies.
they are crazy to price the car at 50k. they seriously think people would rather buy their unknown car over a tesla?? No way would i shell out 50k for a car from a unknown brand coming from a non 1st world nation.
Vinfast is building a huge factory near the small town of Pittsboro North Carolina, they are running behind in their initial time frame.
I drive a 2004 hi performance ford. no infotainment. no land detection or other aids. It just WORKS (and very fast) Cars like this make me want to never change.
Vinnfast ,basically a EV built in Vietnam at a old GM Daewoo Vietnam plant that they bought, it's more like Vinnslow
Please do a follow up.
What if you need to switch lanes in an emergency situation and don't have time to use the blinker? It will stop you from turning the wheel? That's ridiculous.
I cant wait for a software update to entirely change the suspension on the car.
The new tesla has basically the same start up procedure, moreover Tesla doesn't have a reverse button.
I kept thinking of 'DinFast' from Big Bang Theory.
thank you were sorry about your car?too 😂 much issue
I'd rather drive a horse and buggy than that car...LOL. It is like the horror before you die..LMAO !
you have to update patch for a car.  what a time to be alive
I drove it at the Canadian auto show. A pre production model. 🥴 Somehow they made it worse.
That chimes issue sounds like my Android phone.  CONSTANT attention demands.  Screens I never asked for.  Permissions needed.  I come from Windows Phone, drove like a Bentley.   So glad to know that the VN war ate up 58,000 American lives, and many times that of the Viet Namese so that they became capitalists anyway.
3:10 how do you call this kind of editing
I can save you from the whole problem. Don't even buy any electric car.
If I had 100$ for each day after day 3 at service for my Volvo, I would have been able to buy another Volvo :D
Give it another shot
Every EV has that startup sequence. Hit the brake and D.... And the blinkers never turn off if you just change a lane.... Unless you simply tap the stalk. And blind spot monitoring does not work in many cars if you're going below a certain speed... Disappointing
Everything buried in the screen and the lack of a rear wiper are enough to prevent a sale.  Thanks, but no, thanks.
Watched three seconds. Those choppy hand motions make this unwatchable.
How did this car pass all the safety compliance checks?
Send it to South Africa we don't pick and choose lol
Which car you drove in Pakistan it's considered luxury ❤ bro
I never knew this existed!
As Arny would say..."DO eat"
Wow, I have all these problems in a Tesla Y
I can tell you right now that the start up is an issue. Try doing it in bright sunlight, in a sweltering parking lot….that stupid screen will be so washed out that you cannot read it. Also, I hope you never expect to work for an emergency service. Minutes count, man.
ironic that Communist countries (especially dirt poor ones like Vietnam) have BILLIONAIRES...
OMG!!!  It actually runs !!!
Vinfast once reported a Vietnamese customer to their local police force for negatively reviewing their vehicle on YouTube.   Watch your backs out there boys 😂
Call me crazy I still like Chevy’s .
I would never, absolutely never, buy a car that had it's serious issues fixed with a software update. When they stop supporting that car, just like a game console, all those updates will vanish and the car will be a death hazard again
It’s amazing that this thing costs almost twice what mine did.
you guys should  pickup Zach from Fitment Industries
Sorry Natalie :(
Thought it was a Vauxhall
The body is a Renault model from around 2015 so they've only had to concentrate on the ride and safety. Poor showing this
Leader Elon is making sure media is ☠️ car
That billionaire literally asking for another vietnam war for this war crime against all drivers in the world especially the US.
i legit saw 3 in the past two days. First time I had ever seen this brand. Looking at this.. LOL
$50k those cars are cheap as chips here in mexico. 😂🤣😂 They are scamming you Americans lmao
The Vinfast reminds me of my old 88 Hyundai Excel, which was the most unreliable car I've owned (not to mention ridiculously slow). And while that car was a terrible representation of an automobile, I'd feel safer driving that, than a Vinfast. At least when the Excel failed, it just stopped running, I don't trust the Vinfast's ability to turn the steering wheel when it thinks it should, and the beeping would drive me nuts. Plus the Hyundai was very easy to start, or should I say try to start since that didn't always happen. Either way, I would never want to own another Excel, nor would I want to own a Vinfest. I'll stick with Toyotas, Hondas, Mazdas, or Subarus. Thanks for the informative review!
donut media
Thanks team for the great work. Looking forward to watching your review of a updated vf8.
Nasdaily made a video about this car 2 years ago, now it became the TEMU car💀
Cars like this and other "smart" technology is why I stay old-school and would stick with older cars.
50k with a 250 mile range? Nah I'm good. Electric is such a joke.
Totally telling the shop to keep my car for a year...bam!! Car paid off!!!
What a horrid design of a car, why is it even a thing??  It's like we are trying to evolve but taking one step forward then two steps back. Story of society in a nutshell I guess.
50k for that?
this is what happens when a giant communist conglomerate tries to make cars... they realize without the govt's power helping them, they get ripped to shred in international markets
Welcome to the age of unfinished 'early access' shit.
This is Vietnam 's way of getting back at America by k1ll1ng people with these garbage cars.
Nolan wearing a Coffin Flop shirt. That's my exact style.
Hyundais jerk the wheel back to if you don’t cut the blinker on to switch lanes. It will KILL YOU if you don’t turn the blinker on. I went to switch lanes going 75 on interstate and the car slammed on breaks and jerked back into the lane by itself
Ethan Klein is reviewing cars now?
VINFAST WILL SURVIVE IN USA..THEY ARE BIG COMPANY .
Lol @ vietnamese
Despite the claims of "everyone being equal" under communism, in reality it is a very authoritarian system with a rigid hierarchy. What happened with this car is some higher up made a bad design decision, and due to the inflexibility of the hierarchy any suggestions for improvements by anyone lower in the hierarchy were dismissed without any recourse by the lower ranked employees. So only when someone even higher in the hierarchy than the executive who made the bad decision is made aware of the issue can they force the bad decision to be corrected.
50K for that ? wow some people are crazy to buy it
This is a Renault copy...
You buy it🙂
Do it again.
A coffin flop sweatshirt? Thats right in my Q zone.
Hey , I remember people saying "KIA ??? WOULD YOU OWN A CAR CALLED KIA???"   But i also remember driving in a YUGO  and my first car was a PINTO
I think you Americans just need to harden up 🙄
They had battery-powered cars on the road in 1896. They had battery-powered cars on the MOON in 1971. This is the best Viet Nam can come up with? How is this thing even allowed in the country?
This video became annoying within the first 4 minutes.  The guy with the green cap in more annoying than the chimes in the car 😂 I would hate to see/hear him drunk.
Get the camera man into detox fast.
The Vinfast seems to be the Oceangate of the automotive world.  Just without the implody thingy.
There could be hope left!!
WTF! Vinfast is so bad that it makes even Nissan, Hyundai/Kia, Chrysler, GM, VW look good and they are not exactly quality superstars. I think I wll stay with the quality stars of Toyota, Honda, Mazda. 😬
Is it only me or does that thing look like a toyota rav4?
They literally let anyone make an EV car even if it’s not drivable.
Definitely do more updates on the VinFast.  This could be the most fun that a new car has unintentionally provided in a long time.  And who knows, maybe they're honest and competent enough to make it really good.
Vinfast logo reminds of Tesla. Haha!
The fact that we as consumers get a non-final product released to us, pay full price for it, and hope it gets better later is insane. I've heard about that with video games and thought it was a waste. But a car???? That is extremely unacceptable. There is no software update for oversprung suspension. Or a failure due to poor wiring.
You guys should be reviewing Chinese EVs.  Since Chinese EVs aren't available in USA, you should go over to China and review all their EVS starting with BYD EVs.  This way we know what we are missing, and why we don't have affordable Chinese EVs in America, and how much freedom we really have in America.
LOL!   My 2010 Dodge Challenger SE had exactly the same throttle response.  You can slap the throttle like they were doing and the car just snickers at you.  I hate electronic throttles.
I vote for the update after the software fixes, but what about that suspension?!? Can’t fix that over WiFi 😬
They created Vinfast for money Laudery. In Vietnam, anyone review negative about the car like these two men will see police at their door. They use police or thugs to shut down anyone say negative about the car. Anyone buy their cars will be patriotic
Nothing about this car and brand is interesting. Move on to something worth your time fellas.
❤❤❤
So if you attempt to avoid a collision you're out of luck unless you signal??????? WTF.🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
You cant switch lanes without the turn signals? Good make every bmw driver one for a year.
good stuff
Unless its a V8 offroad mega boat, it just cant cut it on US roads. Our roads are too diverse and the conditions vary too the extreme. Not mention just the lack of driving skills of other drivers.
do an update video in a few months see if its worth it because an suv EV at 50k isnt horrible if its done right
£38k only 3k more than a top of the range Honda Goldwing
Is it safe to sell unfinished cars?
if you talks bad about this car in Vietnam, vinfast will hire 1000 people to attack you online or call police to your house and make yo regret about it. "You talked shit about vf cars ? do you have money to buy it, you are traitor ? you no money !"
You can’t compare video games to a vehicle. People’s lives are at stake. It just takes one death to be attributed to a vehicle malfunction and they’re toast. But with all that money, I guess they’ll buy their way out of it.
Why do I get the feeling there's a lot of people that's gonna attempt insurance scamming with this car
What the hell is that,, I've never heard of that car?
"This car sucks... nothing works properly" "Yeah... we know. We will patch it with an update"  Didn't knew EA was doing cars now.
I guess they've never heard the expression, "You get one shot at the golden ring". I doubt they'll survive this debacle. The competition is too stiff.😢
Imagine being the worst rated car company even though Chrysler exists
Great job NOT mentioning that OTHER EV co.
Give them a chance. Vietnamese are real car nuts in Australia. They have achieved a lot in a short period of time.
No Man's Sky is an amazing game
They will fix it. I remember back when hyundai means "Hope You Understand Nothing is Drivable And Inexpensive." And now they compete among the car giants.
Why would anyone pay $50k for a Vietnamese car in the first place???
I feel sorry for the service technician. I can see all the BS...
Love the content and hope u can spread it more cause we cant do it here in VietNam Just 1 complain and bad review abt it and we ll get into big trouble. Hmm 3rd world country i suppose
Junk car
Pretty crazy that Communist Countries are minting Billionaires faster than Capitalist ones. Why even pretend anymore? Just say you want all the power and in exchange youll let people make money? China is saying the quite part out loud on a few things, just waiting for the charade to stop.
Lol i never thought id see the day when I go from day 1 patches to my video games day 1 patches for my car. Godspeed to anyone that has this car.
the shit car was made from dirty money made from vietnam
I'm okay with it not letting you change lanes without signaling, actually. That's one of the biggest things that upsets me on the road because there is exactly ZERO reason to do it other than laziness...or in other words, to be a complete @$$ by showing no thought or concern for the safety of others.  Want to significantly reduce aggressive driving? Equip every motor vehicle with a device that somehow punishes the driver if they fail to use their signal properly, hog the passing lane, or blind other drivers with their high beams.  Now, having written that, I realize that it's a bit of a hot take, and I doubt you could devise a real-world system that would detect all of those situations 100% accurately...but if such a thing could exist, I would support implementing it. Eliminating these bad habits would remove many of the situations that cause other drivers to become frustrated and resort to aggressive maneuvers.  And yes, I can accept the consequences should my own driving habits fall short of ideal.
Anyone else want them to review driving videogames?
Hmm...at 2:07 "Sunroof" appears on the board....wasn't there before...and disappears after...inquisitive minds gotta know...what's the story with that?
Cyberpunk is not getting any better. No mans sky got way better
The product has just been released, if there is anything that is not perfect, please comment on the manufacturer, then say negative,
In a weird historical sense, one can say Vietnam won the battle but lost the war.
electronics apps need to stay the fuck out of cars. This is STUPID
Other car companies will thank you for the design they can copy and you keep the car..
Well it wasn’t called WinFast,which was a hint..
JFC our ancestors are turning over right now.   I’d like to see you two premadonnas do a test drive on a covered wagon.   It’d be a trip to the ER.    I’m just joking. That car sucks😂
Lmao you know it’s gonna be bad when the car is coming from a country where everyone rides bikes and mopeds
junk................
sound mix is terrible. sometimes it's loud, sometimes i can't hear the hosts
Try vinfast again, sounds like a company that is trying to increase there quality, not easy to do for a new car company.
One thing i don't like about this car is the lack of a gauge cluster right above the steering wheel, in front of the driver. Having to rely on the central console is annoyng. It reminds me of the Lancia Y and Mini.
Do a follow up at some point. This car may have real potential and actually be good.  It's just a shame it's 50 grand and it's performing way below other EV's in this segment at the moment.
du ma
I am from VietNam. To see video and read comments below i feel sad. VF is a start up. Their cars have many problem and to become good car they need to hardwork. I hope that admin can review VF8 with new upgrade to show people how VF fix their car and review VF9. VF9 is better than VF8.
Bet the little car is not too popular with 70+ year old Vets….
Quá đẹp vinfast ơi ❤❤❤
Do you want to be BBQ
If you don't want to die don't try it
Garbage 🗑️…. Battery charge doesn’t hold, car wheels shakes around 70 miles per hour. A piece of junk. Do not buy.
Thank you, we’re sorry. Lmao!
I'm not buying new cars partly because they are overengeneered and partly because they are way to expensive!
Mitsubishi will have to work harder to reclaim their worst car titles! Maybe they can work on the Mirage a bit? It has been at the bottom for 30 years!
I can already tell you just from the start up, if everything is dependent on that screen to be working, all it’s going to take is one loose wire or one $5 fuse for you to be calling a tow truck. If every gauge blew out on my Honda, I can still turn the key and drive it slowly to a repair shop.
That is an excellent example of overengeneering. We already know, how to build an ergonomic driver's place with all the buttons and levers.
Update
Still amazing they rolled this out basically during the plandemic and it’s as good as it is. And it’s good looking
Cyberpunk was only garbage on last gen consoles where it shouldn't even have been released in the first place. But it was perfectly fine on PC.
YES PLEASE do an update video!!
Pretty popular here vietnamese like it
😂😂😂
Why would someone spend 50K on that?
💩💩💩
We have seen this happen lots of times before.  We bought a Hyundai where it lasted for the warranty of 100K.  Then it required major spending.  So these cars are good to trade in before the mileage
When you buy your car from Wish 😂
Apparently Lada has been overthrown from the spot for the worst car ever
Ola's Bhavish: Hold my suspension
Pls do another video about this Vinfast peace of sh*t, its very entertaining!
Feel bad for thief trying to steal that car..
13:32 lmao 😂😂😂😂😂
Toyota or Honda problem solved. Those are the only Asian cars you should buy.
Vietnam's late and failed revenge on the US
"Thank you and we're sorry" 💀💀
Nobody wanna buy it in vietnam
You all blame Chinese companies copying western ideas to offer a worse but cheaper option, but this Vinfast looks like they are copying one of those new Chinese EV company.  So, James understands all the equations behind the correct answer, Wong just copied the correct answer from James, and Nguyen paid Wong for the same answer but Wong sold him a fake one.
I wonder why Vietnam even bother to make Vinfast car. Vinfast should make useful everyday things like machines... all machines for factories in Vietnam are China, Korea, Japan made. When Vietnam make something, China already 20 step ahead. Now I’m living in Vietnam, but I used to live in newton Wichita Kansas for a while. So I know how both society work. Vietnam still a poor, underdeveloped country, about 85% of population donot finish high school. Vietnam not capable of making any high tech stuff.  Vinfast is a case of, you barely know how to read and write, but you want to become a engineer or scientist. Suddenly vinfast car came from nowhere, and want to compete on world stage. This is how american say, it is totally nonsense.
So Vinfast is following the Tesla formula?
Great video gents!
The difference between a video game and this car is that in one of them you die virtually.  In the other, you die for real.
You can buy incredible cars in Europe for that amount.
junk car of dictator country
I tested one in Yorkdale center-toronto. It didnt have any of these issues except one, the most important one of all . The suspension is awfull. You can always drive with a blank screen but never with such suspension.…
Laggy accelerator pedal, likely has a low pass filter on it (in software) to smooth the signal, and it needs a bit of tuning. I've seen the same thing with tank sensors om boats, which are damped so a jostling boat doesn't cause the reading to jump around, but if you refill the tank quickly you have to add an exception in the software to notice that quick changing reading faster.
6:10 HAS to be put in all BMW cars lol...
Smells like racism
the more and more reviews I am watching about various new cars, I am going to keep my 2013 mercedes for as long as I can.
These are problems with gas-powered cars though. We rented a 2021 corolla, and with the cruise control on, it did virtually everything on this list lol
50k is a lot of money for me, I can’t even afford a crappy car like this :(
Donut, As an ICE car expert you are not qualified to judge EVs which are run by softwares unless you get some help in how to familiarize yourself first with the Infotainment Screen to select options. You risk damaging your reputation by making wrong assessment.. Act like Kim Java. I'd suggest you ask Vinfast nicely, they can make available a VF8 with the latest update along with someone to guide you through the features of the Infotaintment, that's where all the commands are. VF8 is a smart EV equipped with ADAS and AI, hence the relatively high price tag. Cheaper EVs like VF7, VF6 will be soon available for placing order.
The Vietnamese are known for their automotive genius what a shocker to find out it sucks.
Wow
What can we really expect from Vietnam...
Especially when I think about the complicated startup and the annoying blinker mode, I wonder, if this car even has been tested, before they started production.
Everyone gets nausious on the 405 it is a smog channel. I agree the car sucks.
So happy not Inka Europe geht's banana Cars
Fuck this car
$50K for a regular electric soap box that probably costs less than $20K to build is a lot of money that does not go directly into the car purchase. But then, several Ks are likely paid back to the driver as part of their policy to iron out the bugs.  Regarding the start up sequence, it is inexcusable. Not the start up sequence by itself, but the fact that the screen does not tell you how to start the engine, like even my old car does for the very same start up sequence (except mine is a dedicated physical Start/Stop big visible button, not a touch-screen button. As for the blinkers, you didn't test them according to the drivers complaint you described yourself. You tested it just once, and not in the conditions stated, so your results are not significative, they don't confirm or deny the complaint.  The scariest though is that the car broke down my Internet connection right as I was watching it bricking itself!
Its absolutely crazy that I pry pumped out around 3000 front lower control arms for vinfast and they told me it was the same control arms bmw was using but just different badges lol 😂😂 glad I dont work at that job anymore 😅
The final conclusion is "nothing works". That is damning. I am not surprised in the least. These people at Vinfast have zero knowledge and no experience building a car. They started this venture in 2017. With a couple of billion dollars on hand from their real estate business Vingroup they decided to build a "world beating" car. Within a year they'd had an assembly plant up and running in Haiphong. Imagine one year from design concept to actually running a real steel-and-concrete auto assembly plant. They bought everything needed to build a car, from platform and frame at BMW, to doors, windshields, seats etc at Magna International, down to tires, sparks plugs, bolts and nuts at Bosch, Denso, Continental and dozens of other major auto parts suppliers around the world. They actually turned out real cars that can run and stop. The result is now we know.
It'd be one thing if this was a budget EV, but when it competes with the EV6, ionic 5 and mach E, this is absolutely unacceptable. And offering you $100 to "f*** off" is a complete insult.
Can't change lanes without the turn signal on? How the hell can you avoid an accident or hitting an animal?
Too much technology.Its not necessary.Not using the indicator which results in locking the steering wheel is lunacy and could result in an accident.What would happen if you had to swerve to avoid someone in the road and the steering locked.Computers go wrong,fact.They can’t make computers and sensors now that are reliable.Remember the 737 max,how many people died? That fault was to cover up a design fault.Think about it.
You'll know the 2nd time.
Cheap boys Donut guys 😂
Follow required. I'd like to see how much they've 'put right'. It's a pretty 'non-descript' looking vehicle from the outside. Maybe they should face-lift it already, too!
Conclusion: Buy American ! 😉
Imagine vietnamese manufacturer industry is not able to make any screws for Samsung but the worst car vinfast named " made in vietnam " . dont be idiots in the chinese car !
thanks for the review, so that we don't have to waste our money!
I guess it s not worth $50000.
electric cars suck man made climate change DOES NOT EXIST so gimme a gas guzzler anyday
What the hell is Volkswagon
Fact: even Vietnamese trying to avoid these cars.
If they priced it competitively under $20k and told customers they would be fixing issues with software updates then it would be more forgivable, after all they are essentially using their customers as beta testers, so it's a bit rich to expect people to pay $50K to be a beta tester when they can pay less than that for a fully functional EV
About the chimes: basic psychology says that too many alarms after a while mean no alarm at all.
I would love to see this company fail, as they are not a good company in Vietnam.
Shame as it doesn't look a bad vehicle.
Even if the bugs are fixed , their initial release will create a bad image for em
Vietnam's revenge on the US! They don't forget!
Hopefully Vinfast will improve their products’ performance time over time.
The Whole Review  Looks Like Another Efforts By Americans To Complete The Destructions Of Vietnam Which The  Americans Failed Completely To Do So  During US's Vietnamese War & Rampages & Objectives
Drivers aids, chimes, It does seem anymore annoying than an E-Niro 🤗
This reminds me of  a movie vacation (2015), they rented albanian car and it was fun to watch its features in funny way.
Nam here. We experienced so many traffic and reason was a vinfast died in the middle of the road lol. And its true i get car sick everytime drive or being passenger on a vf cars(they opend an E taxi brand here), horrible susp, disgusting interior smell, loud tyres sounds that they just cant solve… i’m very sure wont buy a vf within 7-10 years, it obv takes time to solve problems. Or not😬
Don't they test drive a car before production?
1st The car is probably designed for another market, with different roads. That is why the suspension might be bad for American roads. Suspension is a rough thing to engineer well. Besides that, compare American cars and German cars. The American suspension is usually much softer.  2nd Most problems come due to bad software. I mean, remember the first days of tesla. Did it work perfectly? And the other thing is, that again, this car is probably designed for another market. Different people have different habits. I think, f.i. that the warnings if a car is aside of you, is more likely a warning if there is a car in your dead spot. Might not be what is convenient, though.  I think it might become a nice car brand in the future. But it HAS to be worth the price. And this car ain't.
Try it again.
The car won't start unless your seatbelt is on?
Exaggerating the truth
First time I’ve ever hear of this brand.  Anyway, I've recently driven an Aiways. Had never heard of that brand before either. Yet there are *so* *many* *similarities* between this review and my experience with the Aiways — almost the exact same kind of issues!  So, the car sharing network I’m subscribed to bought a few of those Aiways and I went to test it out of pure curiosity, because I had already driven all types they had (Citroën C1, Renault Clio, Audi A5, Renault Mégane, Tesla Model 3 LR, VW ID.3, VW e-up, Fiat 500e, Škoda Octavia, Audi e-tron 55, BMW X2, VW Golf, Toyota Yaris + ~10 more I don’t even remember any more) and wanted to try the Aiways too.  Well, it was not disastrous, but not great either. 🫤  0. I hate SUVs. So I started with a bias in this regard. 1. The battery capacity was like 1/4 of what the route computer said. I kid you not. Really a problem. Utter BS. The car's usable range was below 100 km. 2. The ride and suspension was *bad*. It felt more like a delivery truck rather than an SUV. 3. Charging was slow. Like, 80 kW at most on a CCS2 where I normally get over 200 kW with other cars. It was at night, no power shortages anywhere. 4. The adaptive cruise control was so bad that I just stopped using it. It was jerky and it just didn’t feel right. It felt like if I wanted to get through a morning traffic jam with that ACC, I would crash rather soon. 5. It had like 5 displays, but the display font was disastrously bad, like one of those typography disasters that are embedded in vertically typeset fonts for Japanese and Chinese such that Latin characters (SI units, abbreviations) can be included. Obviously, these characters are utterly unfit for Latin alphabet-based left-to-right typography and they scream “hey, a font designer has *never* seen this”. 6. The dashboard and the doors don’t quite line up, as if they came from two separate projects. 7. It is *never* charged properly, because (I kid you not), unlocking the car stops charging without a warning! The typical pathological scenario: — Customer returns the car to the sharing network’s parking spot. — Customer plugs in the charger, as they should. — Car charges normally. — Customer locks the car. All good up to this point. — Customer recalls they forgot a personal item. Walks back, unlocks the car, gets the item, locks the car… — Little do they know that this stopped the charging session (!!!), so the next customer will be faced with the harsh reality of a low battery state.  8. The seats were great. Not sure why, given how little there was to adjust, but somehow, magically, thet were the perfect fit for me. 8. The view from the car was the best of the best. SUVs are usually s.h.i.t.t.y cars in this regard, big and fat yet impossible to see out of properly. Not an issue on the Aiways though. I had no problem driving 10 cm from a curb when needed, without kissing it yet without uncertainty or doubt; the overall visibility and simple hood shape was a plus on this one.  What definitely resonates with my experience is the statement that it feels like something rushed. That was exactly my impression of the Aiways.
Volkswagon omg really?
Looks like a renault
This is an Asia car You guys America can’t not understand
Saw this at the showroom today. Waste of space car…
Do the followup! See how much it fixes?
The murderer would rather go to prison rather than drive that car ever again.
the car if recognises safe lane change shloud TURN ON BLINKER AUTOMATICALY,
This is no where near as exceptional as not only the greatest car but the greatest piece of machinery ever devised by man, the Yugo.
If this is a modern car, I'll be a retro-driver for the rest of my life. I don't want a tablet on my car, I don't want a car that doesn't allow me to steer in certain conditions, and I don't want to be (ineptly) treated like an infant by a car when I'm a grown man.
$25K car pretends to be worth $50K ?
Thanks for sharing issues. Hope VF solves them via OTA soon
Looks like an ad.
There are some people who claim to be Vietnamese and want to attack vinfast, please correct that they are not Vietnamese but they are refugees from the Vietnam War, so they have a grudge against Vietnam.  Vietnamese people, they are the scoundrels of society
A car that doesn't let you turn without activating a blinker? That's very dangerous.
Saw the price and competitors (5 sec in the beginning), see no point to watch further.
hater gonna hate.
Wouldn’t buy this over a Tesla. The only pro is that it’s more unique.
It’s gotta be the most generic design too on top of that.
There are some people who claim to be Vietnamese and want to attack vinfast, please correct that they are not Vietnamese but they are refugees from the Vietnam War, so they have a grudge against Vietnam.  Vietnamese people, they are the scoundrels of society
Có 1 số người tự nhận là người việt nam rồi muốn tấn công vinfast  xin đính chính lại họ không phải người việt nam mà họ là những người tị nạn từ thời chiến tranh việt nam nên họ có mối thù với việt nam .họ không phải người việt nam mà họ là những kẻ đê tiện của xã hội
Two obese white men in da VinFast rambling 😂
Who would even buy this car when you have got so many better options
Nó cảnh báo bạn không nhìn đường.hay chú ý đường đi
I'm not sure if "We didn't die." is supposed to be a win with a new car. You'd kinda expect that as standard.
Please try indian companies u willl pike with low price
The only Asian car brands you should buy are from Japan.  I have a Korean phone but would never buy a Korean car, so Vietnamese cars are a definite no buy!
This is the 2023 Yugo
dont you DARE INSULTED MAH VIETNAMESE CAR
Dude, you pronounce its name wrong. It’s called VINFART. 😂
Imagine being able to buy an Audi S3, a Genesis G70 or a Mercedes Benz AMG A35 and being like "Hm, nope...Im gonna buy a Vinfast"
im sorry, but i absolutely wouldve given it a red square for that awful startup procedure, also sets a scary precedent if company's can sell a garbage car and just ''do a software update'' later, look at what that way of thinking has done to the gaming industry.
the liberal got triggered right out the gate lol...
I just saw one of these for the first time today, it was holding up traffic on the 405 broken down. Finally I'm home, google Vinfast, and see this video. Shocker.
This was too entertaining to not do a follow up. Also... I mean, how often do new car makers come along in the US? REVIEW AGAIN!! (I hope it fails for the lulz though)
Why not just buy a fking model y lol
Even my Volt annoys me with chiming me all the time. LOL
If you fail the start every time you get into the car you should review your behaviour.
In Vietnam they don't really use turn signals
I over heard vinfast offered your guys $10,000. Right?  Vinfast is willing to pay money for anyone gave them a best review.
I am with you, just put an electric engine in a standard car, no bells and whistles needed.... or chimes. I am in the UK and have plans to convert my old 1996 JDM Subaru GTB to electric at some point. I have seen a few conversions but people use cars that are not designed for any sort of decent power like VW Beetles. It's okay to convert them but putting a 600hp equivelent electric motor in them will take a lot of work to use  that power properly..
When I stomp the accelerator to to get out of a potentially hazardous situation on the road I expect the vehicle to GO! And you don't always have time for turn signals. Why are they trying to design a car that tries to think for you? That's the problem with AI, it's not a real time human brain. Quit trying to make it into one!
Vinfast, more like Sinfast. Its a Sin and i can't get rid of it Fast enough.
The good thing is its made in vietnam and not made in china shiiit. Id rather take the risk from made in vietnam cars than china
The fact that you can’t steer certain directions if you don’t put on the blinker is an enormous safety hazard. I guess if someone slams on their breaks in front of you or is barreling towards you from the other side of the road and you don’t have enough time to react to put the blinker on before you swerve then you’re just screwed.
Give them a second chance.
Shitty car from a 3rd world country…
Give the car an update, then go ahead an give us an update
It's a cute car though
I’m not always trying to drive when I want to start my vehicles so forcing you to have your doors closed and seatbelt buckled just to start is dumb. I disagree with you guys on that.
hey i'm vietnamese bro
Please everybody. There's saying by our former south VN president Nguyen Van Thieu. " Never ever listen to what the communist said but just see their action". I hope that American are not easily fall into Vin fast's trap or else you'll be BIN fast your ev. Please spend your money wisely. Cheers from Australia 🇦🇺
Horrible vehicle...but I can't say I'm happy with the direction vehicles are heading.  So many electronics, so many points of failure. I don't want lane assist whatever garbage, especially systems that stop my from having control. I don't want things beeping at me. The only thing I would use is a backup camera, considering how vehicles now aren't the the best for visibility while reversing.  Learn to drive a damn vehicle. Set up your mirrors properly, shoulder check. L 4:06 ook up a head, to where you will be, not what is just a few feet in front of you.   I always check my mirrors, the rear view  to know where cars are that could be in close proximity in time, side mirrors to show me some of my blindspot, and then shoulder checking to get that immediate information when I'm about to do something.  As for looking ahead, I look for brake lights, lane changes, signs, construction. When I see something, I decide what to do, and make an action with time, rather than last second like many.
I watched a video last week about How Vinfast is now open taxi company using only their electric cars. My wife then told me she used their Vinfast taxi to go the TSN airport. They have a deal with airport authority that allows only their Vinfast cars to enter with no entrance fee, and they have privilege parking spaces too . All other taxi companies lost out to Vinfast for that reason. Which is really bs and unfair to say the least
Can someone add vietnamese subtitles? I would like to see the s**tstorm this video would cause in Vietnam xd
Its a fascist car.  No belt no drive.
“Volkswagon”? And you call yourselves car guys? WTF?
I feel so sad about the state of Vietnam made cars. They can't stand shoulder to shoulder with the world other car manufacturers, and yet they act as if they've arrived. All the video they made to promote their cars sounded very absurd. Instead being humble they sounded like they are better than Tesla's already.
In Vietnam, Vinfast VF8 is experiencing a lot of technical errors related to the sensor electronic system, which makes the car have to go to repair a lot of money and time.
DA BLINKERS??
Did any software updates fix the springs?
If it cost 25,000-30,000$, it would be the best selling ev in America
If you make it work like car, any car thief will figure it out 😂
Another shot 👌
This thing literally looks like a car that should be in GTA 5
That VinFast has AFLAC
I really have a doubt concerning the sincerity of this review.  I test the car by myself and I find  this car is very good.  I also read good review about Vinfast VF8 from others American publication for JD power The Engaget The Detroit Bureau  Novak and from Canadian and European press. These youtubers made this video to have a lot of views and to make money ? .
Hay lắm vinfast:))
The way this is filmed reminds of a 2011 YouTube  skate board video
Thank you for your honest assessment as a Vietnamese. I really want Vinfast to develop and get better in the future, looking forward to receiving your international support.
try ford figo
As a Vietnamese, I totally agree with you on it's too early to release these, but I also kindda understand them why. Still quite good in Vietnam  with a lot of sale off, voucher and such. Hope, really hope they take up all negative review with open mind and imrpove them (just like no man sky do). If they can keep it up, I believe in just 5-10 years, they will be another like Hyundai of Vietnam.
Put this car in Forza Horizon 5.
Well no wonder Ive not heard of this company... Because it's an "E-Car" company. Who gives a crap about it.  When I saw your video was about an "electric car" I quickly turned your video off. 👎 I got better things to watch.
I’m never buying a vinfast. Shoot, It just might be worse than GM or RAM cars.
you can get a C class AMG with 50,000 usd, Wht was Vinfast thinking?
isn’t also a key issue with the battery is, it’s a subscription based service?
Better than Hyundai and Kia for sure. They just don't have the money to silence people like Hyundai does.
As an American I wouldn't look at one just on principle.
$100/day  if it's in the shop for over 4 day?  Ford, GM and Chrysler would be broke in a week!
Please do a follow up. Except for the suspension, most of those issues SHOULD be able to be addressed through over the air updates (if that's how they do them, or does it need the dealers loving touch?).
A rookie always needs time to get to know. Please keep good work, Vinfast!
So basically the car being sold is being beta tested by the consumer
Made by  a commie..no thanks!
"complete electrical failure" main panel still works......not quite accurate.....still hot garbage tho
Do it!
Have you tried pedaling a car like that that can accelerate well?  I dare you to poop without peeing!
So basically people buying this car paid $50K to be beta testers. My Mustang mercifully rarely chimes at me, only if the seatbelt is unfastened, and the parking sensors in reverse. And that's more than enough.
My car is way less expensive than this car but it’s way better
I think the biggest problem here is an unknown company trying to sell a car at 50k.
If it stops you from turning unless you have a blinker on, That is just a danger to everyone. If a car had that I would just never use that car.
A bad section of the 405! Have you ever tried driving on Quebec roads?
We fucked them in Vietnam.  They're just returning the favor.
That Tesla at 7:59 was like 👀
How could it be that bad? The German and the Italian built this car. Maybe Vinfast was too cheap to pay for the better engineering.
Send it back to Vietnam, to many bugs.
Rule Number 1: NEVER BUY A FIRST GENERATION CAR
I wonder, how do you fix stiff springs via software update...  The starting might be intuitive, but having usual "START" button will always be more intuitive.
This is a state owned company. They’re just using the guy as a coverup.
Just trying figure out why anyone would buy a Vinfast VF8
I like a City Bus better!
Every Vietnamese person I know make fun of this car.
Great point about EV's trying to reinvent the wheel.  My wife drives a 2016 Leaf.  It doesn't have a tablet in the middle of the dash.  Just the standard basic Nissan display that their ICE vehicles have.  Less is more.
Vinfast? Is that a computer motherboard?
The mere fact they can remotely change anything on my car is a big nope for me.
Love the hilarious animations!
This is like one giant commercial for VF…
Electric crap
Gosh, look at the days I've waited to hear this, Vin is absolute trash, even their petro cars are.
Head ache and nausea, perhaps CO2 from an exhaust leak?
On the list you had sunroof, now I’m curious what was wrong with the sunroof
We could not start a VW Up! and had to call a service technician. It was so foreign and illogical that we could not replicate it a second time a few days later. Demand for VW EV has dropped to zero, not low but zero.
LOL. No one steps on acceleration pedal like that, except these guys.
Bro this brand is trash. It was trash from the day they debuted their first vehicle in Vietnam. I’d know, I was there. I visit all the time since my wife is Vietnamese and has family there. I was able to witness the pure and unapologetic problems that their vehicles created for their so called “patriotic consumers”. Those who are willing to spend and support the communist regime in its continued efforts to scam your average buyer and line their pockets with money. If a person ever lived in Vietnam during this brands release, will know they covered up at least 10 different horror stories about these cars malfunctioning. 4 of which were events where the car burst into flames sporadically. Trash brand, made by trashy communists. Now they’re making up excuses to drag out their failure 🤦‍♂️
As a Vietnamese, I just want to say, put your money where your money is actually worth, aka a good, actually functional car, and not just for "patriotic" reasons. The company is having a great trajectory, but it's not enough of an excuse for a badly made product.
Chevy do too
wonder how they'll fix the hardwares by updating the softwares
Thanks for the honest review. The truth has been spoken
Trước khi đọc tin tức gì từ nguồn Việt Nam! Hay suy nghỉ 7 lần trước khi tin. Rất có thể đó chỉ là tuyền truyền, tô vẽ từ chế bộ
Still better than anything made in Russia Pespective.
As a Vietnamese, I like your opinion, fuck those headlines praising how wonderful is this thing😂
The chimes and the driving aids trickled down from the trucking industry that had it first. Too many people suing companies over truck crashes because they decided to run out in front of an 18wheeler expecting it to stop the same. Most drivers find all these systems a major defect and distraction. Could you imagine listening to those things all day every day while you work and try to focus?? In turn this has ran off a lot of the veteran drivers, and replaced with new drivers that rely on those systems rather than having the experience and skill level to maneuver professionally. Also causing roads to be more unsafe. This also can be contributed to higher demand for drivers, higher rates for freight, higher costs for operations of companies that have to buy these systems by law, which means higher prices in stores. Thanks to all the Karen's, you can now see this in consumer cars with higher prices due to all the safety systems on them. What goes around comes around.
The start up procedure is 100% same as a Tesla.
Chỉ một chiếc xe nhưng nói lên tất nhiều điều về chế độ hiện tại ở Việt Nam!. Hóa ra ông tỷ Phú nổi tiếng cũng chỉ là người lươn lẹo đểu giả để sống được ở đất nước này. Cả một bộ máy tuyên truyền, công an bảo vệ cho một chiếc xe đầy lỗi. Chả có cái gì giá trị thực ở Việt Nam! Cả. Tất cả đều tô vẽ, giả tạo, cấm đoán. Chê cũng không được quyền chê. Thật buồn cho cái đất nước này.😢
All I wanna know is what happened to the sunroof check? Why was it removed from the board later in the video? Did the sunroof explode? Ahhhhh, so many questions about the sunroof! Is this a sunroof conspiracy????
So if you had a crash, how screwed would the guy in the back be from all that equipment hitting them?
This is why I still drive and fix my 2005 KIA Sportage. Works everytime and cheap to fix when it actually needs something.
One thing I noticed as a viewer, every time the commentary was recorded while the vehicle was moving, the audio in my subwoofer was very loud.  To the point, I had to lower the volume to prevent waking the kids sleeping in the house.  Can I assume the decibel level while driving was above OSHA standards for a work environment?
No further review needed.
You know even with all this cars problems it’s kinda nice to see a company offering cash and trying to fix the problems instead of just selling you the lemon and moving on, like most American car companies
Fuck it, give the guys and gals a chance to fix there stuff.
You car is #10 boucoup
The name "VINFAST" sounds like the title for the next "Fast and the Furious" movie... And instead, a bottle of nitrous to make it fast, the use of a Flux-Capacitor is used...😅
Do an update on it
Laggy acceleration is common with evs I have operated.
I haven't owned a car for years, because I'm living in Asia. So as a result, I take Grab and Uber very frequently. I've ridden in so many different cars its impossible to remember. There is such a difference in ride quality. And you really notice since I usually ride in the rear. I've ridden in a few really bad ones like this, and yes it will make you sick. Generally the best are Japanese cars. The extended cab pickups here are terrible for rear passengers. Another one that is surprisingly bad is Tesla. I once got locked in the back of a Tesla because the pushbutton wasn't working. The driver had to get out and help me get out of the car. Apparently there is a safety release, but there is zero chance of finding that if in an emergency. After that I refused all rides in Teslas due to safety concern.
never heard of it
Just another EV shitbox… who cares… 🤷‍♂️
This is how things have been vehicle figured out how to put each of the elements I disdain about present day vehicles in a single vehicle.
As far as I'm concerned, they can shove these EV's so far up their asses that a crane couldn't pull them out.  They're fucking creepy, and definitely not an environmental improvement.
Maybe you have to know Vietnamese language to start it ?if you can read the the book in the glove compartment and translate it  it will say YOUR FUCKED..
because its ugly. vietnam cant even design car
If idiots would stop buying computers on wheels we wouldn't have a lot of these problems. Just buy a fuckin car.
All of a sudden I appreciate my Tesla more..my Tesla  quality issues are not that bad 😀
So,, someone finally built the 6000 SUX.
You lost me at "Vietnamese" and "electric."
Vinfast sued Vietnamese YouTuber in Vietnam  for doing honest reviews of a band new car he bought from them .  😂
Hahaha looks like they raced the Covid vaccine manufacturers 😂 look how good that turned out hahahaa. Lesson : LONG TERM STUDY is a good thing
These comments aren’t in chronological order. They’re scrambled.   A new comment posted thirty minutes ago appears behind a comment that was posted months ago.  The scrambled time order is supposed to confuse people so they can’t see a logical sequence of posts. If there’s no rational discussion on YouTube, then there’s no need for the government to be rational about anything.  Just random B.S.  Of course tyranny is normal! There’s nothing to talk about.
Having a camera jerk around like that is annoying, AF, stop it
I hear no man's sky is better but after buying it day one getting hyped up like that still a waste of money no matter what. Same concept with this car if you buy it and it sucks out the gate bad taste never gonna buy another if you get it after its been fixed I bet it's ok (also idk about battery life, comfort, dependability.. ect). I say this car is probably a 2-10 but with all the fixes goes up to a 4-10 at most... which is fine for the average ev person
Use that car for a month or so, then you can spot if there's really problem in that car
The 'wwaaaaahahahaaaaaa' dumbfounded thing had me laughing
Looks like an accident waiting to happen
I love the design of this car
Car nice❤
That car has serious safety issues. Let me guess, currently sold in Walmart!

Thanks, I'll drive a gas powered 3-series instead
“InsideEVs” oh they lame
I’m Vietnamese and I’d never buy a Vinfast 😂
“Electric” ohhh its a pile We are surprised here ?
Unable to watch the full video because I was distracted by the guy in the green cap that reminded me of a cow chewing its cud.  Ditch the gum next time.
About the pedal, they called it as a safety feature to avoid unwanted actions. So the  pedal's "lag" is a feature
Vin trash 😂
Vietnam shouldnt make cars
donut media the next top gear
bullshit review , how much did they pay you bro ? i want to be part of it :)
The ride quality, accelerator pedal issues, and worthless/dangerous driver aids should have never made it out of testing like this...wow. I don't think I would buy this car for 5 grand, let alone 50K.
My wife new Mercedes is a piece of garbage also center electronics console keeps going dead and needs a day to reset. How about learning the cars features prior to buying one not just get in and wing it.

Never buy the 1st  year model of any vehicle.
I would rather buy a honda than dumping 50 grand on this thing
Piece of Junk Car😆
“The turn signal doesn’t turn off well enough.” Well. You didn’t turn a corner. You changed lanes. So
the chimes alone would make me return to the delarship 😭
The start-up sequence isn't that bad as you perform those steps subconsciously before turning the key. The only thing missing here is the key.  When I get into my car, first I close the door, then I put my seatbelt on (as my hand is still near that area anyway), put my foot on the brake while putting the key in the ignition (and my other foot is on the clutch as I have a stickshifter), and then turn the key to start.  Now I can imagine that people can get into issues when they first want to start the car and then put the seatbelt on afterwards. I guess a lot of people switch those two steps around; which would cause this particular car to not start. In this respect I can't fault that Vietnamese company for putting safety first in making sure that the occupants have their seatbelts on before the car will start. 🙂  Back to the show...  EDIT: After having watched the entire video it definitely becomes clear that the intention was good but the execution was poor. This car definitely needed a lot more testing and several 'features' should not have been implemented as they lead to a detrimental experience. The last thing I would want is my car deciding how I should drive. Especially ripping the steering wheel over just because you forgot the blinkers could lead to some annoyances.
So is it just rock auto parts car
7.8 Million subscribe,  congratulations 🎉
Its a new feature called simulated turbo lag
Okay, but if you _are_ changing lanes _without_ your blinkers, you're helping contribute to automotive accidents, so I like that being a feature
What happened to the sunroof?
New car makers in the US  have such an uphill climb.  They have to convince buyers that they'll take care of them when there's issues.  They also need to assure customers they will be here to stay.  For these two reasons, the only way to make inroads is to seriously undercut the competition in price and give seriously long warranties.  Hyundai did this and look where they are now.  The Vinfast is a total non-starter at that price point.  Go ahead, test that thing all day every day, it won't matter.  I do honestly hope they improve and work out all the kinks.  I hope they get some positive press and the company continues to sell cars and improve it's footprint in the US.  But I think before they do, they'll need to take it in the shorts for a while by selling their cars at a competitive price.
50k for that electric POS
You ever want to hear a scary chime???? Drive a VW below 39°
$100 is for the rental car you’ll need.
It’s Vietnamese!  What did you all expect?
Throughout the video, it is true that this channel has made a very fair assessment between the positive aspect and the negative aspect of Vinfast. But scroll down to read the comments of people, who are the same Vietnamese, have an even more NEGATIVE  view than other foreigner look at, especially 3/// people😂
Having no start button or key is actually easier to use once you know how to do it. That's just a dumb complaint by ignorant journalists.
It's an electric car, which is uneconomical, and actually bad for the environment so no never.
Hyundai was like Vinfast when started to sell in America. Now they are much better than that time.(Even Tiger Woods survived after Hyundai car accident). If they put enough effort to improve quality they can improve rapidly, I believe. (but Car maker's reputation? )
Hmm, no wonder why it’s terrible
You guys always feel like "The Guys Next Door'. Thanks for a fun review that didn't make me feel rushed. Great times!
For 50 grand, a vehicle better NOT be a POS! It doesn't even matter if it's a vehicle that was made in Vietnam.
As someone who drives a lot (compared to most), having a car that lags on the gas and fights your steering……i feel it would’ve killed me by now.
VF8 yet contains no V8 engine.
Natalie lee needs a new car
Review it again, this was funny.
Do you guys want to buy a vf8? I would never buy a vf8 even if it was only $10,000
10:12 “It’s like a bad roommate…” This made me laugh out loud. Actually, I guffawed.
I'm happy that now many people in US know that Vietnamese have a car company (Vinfast is a member of Vingroup in Vietnam). That's our first car company after many years of war. After Toyota and Huyndai, we are the third Asian country  exported car to the US. Of course we will face difficulties, but we believe Vinfast will survive and develop.
Who the hell spends 50 grand on a car they haven't reviewed. A quick google search would save people money.
The market spoke volumes about Vinfast cars. According to Experian and Automotive News, only 128 VF8s were registered from January until May 2023. With 3000 cars imported into North America, they are currently sitting somewhere and collecting dust. End of discussion.
What about the sunroof?
My opinions a little biased they have bought  some Portable Car Hoist
The EV balloon is deflating fast, $50k for this bag of crap, I think not.
Tesla is a very bad car!
Even before the video started I assumed that this would be an electric car, looks like I was right.  Looks like 'electrification' has already encouraged fly by night companies since they have fewer regulations to pass through.  A new ICE vehicle will have a much harder time to come to the market because of emissions regulations, but it seems like anything electric is OK.  It's like the Yugo all over again, except that would be a disservice to the Yugo - it actually worked.
All electric cars suck. This one just happens to suck more.
Looks like a VW id4
Don’t know why people are complaining about the start up, it’s literally the exact same as a Tesla. It’s on once you get in.
Rolling crap on wheels.
Im wondering if you can swerve out of the way of obstacles in an emergency? If that steering attempts to fight you back to straight without the indicator on that would be incredibly dangerous. I wondered whether or not if you could force override that feature whilst it's turned on by simply fighting it to override. I assume that this could be turned off? If not it would be extremely unsafe. But if this is there first vehicle let's watch how they progress.
small but annoying issues.
ok.. maybe they will launch some DLCs and pathcs
Give it a second chance
And I hate the dashboard too. I despise cars with large tablet glued on the dash and not having any kind of meters in front of the driver.
Looks nice
Also, dear James, you don’t have to say COVID every time something takes place in 2020. I know it's hard to believe but it's over, and other things happened.
0:58 Dear Jeremiah, you can just say it's you. You don't have to claim to be a director and invent this "Henry" person.
First time I hear about this car
a 50k $ turd
I never had a electric car and have a old 65 mustang. But if I got in a electric car and no button I would try to just go. Lol I thought that’s how they work lol.
the stupid effects and sound effects make this video difficult to watch.
The Vietnamese are getting you americans back for the past..........!!
VINFAST sounds like a 5yo made it up
The car was probably rigged by the owner, audience should know that there's a huge population of Vietnamese Americans who are anti -Vietnam. They even formed terrorist groups inside inside Vietnam.  Not to say official reviews from legit critics are not reliable, but this review from you guys is absolutely questionable because you used a Vietnamese living in America car who probably bought the car, rigged it and contacted you guys to make this horrible review.
crazy quick dev time for a 50K car
Both you guys should lower your food consumption and care for your health.
One more shot, but only one.
I would love to see a IIHS  or Euro NCAP car crash test of this car brand.
rental car is a 100 a day so they are offering a curtesy vehicle lmao
The drive aids were red before the chimes even, the most eagle eyed viewers might notice
😆😆😆
VF8 pfffffffff should of had a V8.
Looks like every other cookie cutter suv out there
Make these $30,000 and I might be able to put up with all the issues until they fix them. At a huge discount I don't mind being the tester.
Không ngoài dự đoán, những đánh giá của các bạn gần như giống cảm nhận của tôi sau 2 tuần trải nghiệm ( anh rể tôi làm việc trong tập đoàn vinfast và được mua xe với giá ưu đãi ). Theo thời gian, mọi thứ sẽ được cải thiện. Nhưng hơn tất cả, họ còn thuê các youtubers quảng cáo cho xe, thậm chí là quảng cáo không trung thực, điều đó đã đi ngược lại với đức tính khiêm tốn của người Việt Nam. Cho nên, tôi sẽ không bao giờ ủng hộ những người không trung thực ( đã từng tẩy chay vì CEO của chiếc điện thoại Bphone ).  Cảm ơn về những đánh giá trung thực.
this will be the Biden car that everyone will be required to drive.
What happened to the Sunroof entry on your list? What was wrong with it?
This car is not safe to drive. It's like a death trap. Brave to drive that thing on the freeway.
Vinfast is "cheating" by not doing the testing themselves. They're just having drivers on the road test their cars and are praying that nothing catastrophic happens that gets them banned until everything is fixed.
I just drove a rented Kia Soul that chimed every time I changed lanes, whether I’d used the signal or not, and each time it startled me and made me think I was doing something very wrong, and i hated it.
Not a very scientific test but that does seem to be a crappy car.
12:39 Bethesda made this car?
Warranty: $100  per incident + 1 large Pho soup + Bah Mi sammich!
This just even more solidifies my desire to probably pick up the EX30 from Volvo next year... So much cheaper and so much better XD
All these problems should have been fixed before they came off the assembly line. They are going down the path of Ford and GM. Putting out junk as new.
Headache =big fat magnetron under your arses!!!
Dude I ride a Renault Clio. That shit, for me, would be a Rolls-Royce.
My 2022 Sentra (gas engine) had a price of about $22000.  I would NEVER pay that much money for ANY vehicle! Especially a relatively new all electric from a somewhat new company with almost no background!
What fool paid 50k for that when you can can a Tesla model 3 for around 35k?
It's the same price point as similar cars, but doesn't live up to any of the competition...? Sounds exactly like a Hyundai or a Kia. I'll just tack Vinfast on to the list of manufacturers I'll never buy from.
Was expecting like a $25K price tag, double that for this faulty RC car is blasphemous
definitely give them a second look they are a new company, look at how bad teslas were/are
Yikes!  What do buyers expect for $50,000? How could any competent company expect people to buy a Vinfast with all of these crazy issues.  When it is not intuitive to start easily it's going to be difficult to sell.
I would buy a $20K car before buying one of these.  At $50K, I would buy a trusted brand.
When James doesn't wear a hat, he looks like Benny Hill.  We just need a Miata with e-power, as James said, don't reinvent the wheel. Just make a great car modern.
They did an update without asking. Now Skype opens everytime you start the car and it asks you if you want to upgrade the operating system.
looks like a renault.
People are complaining about turning the car on? They made it more efficient by getting rid of pushing the start button or using your key.
"Battery death" sounds more like a blown high voltage main fuse!
Wait. You CAN'T switch lanes without a blinker on⁉️ That shouldn't even meet DOT standards. What if a deer or a person run into the street? Will the car force you to hit them of you dont turn on your blinker?
VinFast Paid very good $ for Good Review? 🤣🤣🤣. Would you recommend that is a buy? Would you own a VinFast? 🤣🤣🤣
only American buy this only I am Vietnamese.if give me this car I  for free I don’t take too. why I buy this so stupid for use this car,if you don’t know commission you buy buy good luck .
I was looking at Vinfast as a company that may just had enough backdraft to be a major league contender, albeit unknown. Well.. guess they still need to hone their merchandise.
My sister bought the Hyundai Excel, the first Hyundai model sold in the US, back in like 1986.  It was a total POS but at least it only cost $4k brand new off the lot.  Koreans weren’t building autos (maybe ships?) before that.  Every manufacturer has to start somewhere and we see how far Hyundai has come since then.   Who knows with Vinfast?
Wait...that's not a Vauxhall imported to the States?  I swear it looks exactly like a Vauxhall front end from when they were constantly getting ragged on Top Gear.
You would make this kind of videos really authentic if You didnt knew the coutes of journalist, just have The board in the back, love you guya
Yeah, I'll keep my Honda Accord 6-6 coupe...
Well done!
The major auto manufacturers and their shareholders are desperate to kill off Vinfast before it gets started. A negative press campaign is no surprise.
I  had a huyndai in 80's, it was bad.  look huyndai now.
4:12 BITE ZA DUSTO
i think it's a new way of americans trying to defeat vietnamese after their defeats
It's an EV. Enough said. Ciao.
I had a Toyota Corolla as a rental with lane-keep assist. If you were to change lanes without the directional on, it would scream all kids of alarm and notification on the dash. And the steering wheel got all upset and forced you back. That's something similar to the Vinfast...
what happened to "rolling"
why would you ever wear a hat with lovely locks like that
Who would want to buy one of that???
VOLKSWAGON XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD it is volkswagen
Damnit, why change something that already works? Didn't they say don't fix something that isn't broken? What the hell are these car manufacturers thinking? If this is future of cars, then I rather keep my current icu powered car. I don't want a complex iPhone on wheels. I don't care how powerful or fast those EVs are, I'd rather have a good car that works as it should.
I can think of a few worse cars than this, like the Corolla or Rav4 for example.
Thank for honest reviews
Imagine being surprised that Communists can't build a functioning car 🤷‍♂
if you can drive american car can drive anything.
A follow up is a good idea. Testing the ride on the 405 is a great torture test for the suspension.
Ever single Lane Assist in the world will not let you change lane without a blinker on, and that's exactly how it should be. So people learn how to drive and signal!
How is James always so sunburnt  He literally has a cap on all the time yet his entire face is red
Don’t buy vinphet
I’m surprised this car was approved for sale in the US. Much more established Chinese brands are not even for sale yet. And it’s also fully priced at $50K. What’s the value proposition here? Seems a bit dangerous.
they're just an assembly plant, don't blame them!
Personally I've had my fill of the VC for 56 years
Yeet!!
So long as the start up sequence isn't unduly long, drivers will get used to it and that won't be an issue.
I lived in China for 6 years. In that time I rode in dozens of Chinese domestic cars. The rough ride, comfort issues and lower quality standards are the same.  The car is probably excellent for the East Asian market but they're going to be far behind more seasoned manufacturers.
50k for that ?! More money than brains - yup !
From bullock cart to electric car in one generation? What could go wrong? Everything!
To be honest, though, most of these issues look like they can be fixed. As for price, I really don't know. Over here in Europe, we pay far more tax. (And I live in one of the most densely populated countries on the planet, with a massive traffic problem.)
I remember riding in the back of one of these at the New York auto show last year. The seatbelt didn’t work in the back seat. Pretty bad sign lmao
5 minutes into the video and I already know that car is a pile of junk! Thanks
Piece of Junk!
Seems that coordination of all those services in this car is completely wrong. As if software designers and coders never new what to design and never had a correct leadership and steer. Testing failed too, though for so quickly launched machine it is still quite impressive result. And finally company paying u for the feedback that is not bad. U know what it is a crap car, provided they solve all issues quickly they may have achance to survive. I think they will not survive.
13:12 holy cow! he's got grey hair??? no wonder he wears a hat. No worries bud. We all get there eventually. :)
US let this crappy EV enter US market, but shut off EV from China…
It's my first time hearing about Vinfast. What a shitshow of a car.
You can do it!! No seriously, see if they have fixed it 😊
All vehicle manufacturers are alike and yet no one learns their mistakes Just pay off the customer without fixing the issues at hand  Car updates should not work like phone updates 💀 Over the air vs physical dedication to check and see if the system operates better after initial update  Air updates may work if you can manually restart the entire car system like you do with phone
50k? OMG. they should start with 10k cars order to get any attention..
This is more laughable than the sub that just got crushed.
You know a car is bad when Car and Driver don't like it (because they seemingly like everything).
The fact that they think they can “fix it in post” with software is a JOKE. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE. GET THIS OFF THE ROAD.
Just realized these guys are two different people after 4 years
Lux a is fake bmw electric car is so bad. Im vietnamese and of course its normal. Not like vinaxuki.
I’m sick of billionaires littering the road with subpar bs. This is a scourge lol.
I will buy Vinfast vf8 when they fix the issue in video❤
Just like a German car, riddled with faults and insanely expensive to buy and fix...
For a new car from Vietnam it should cost around $20,000.  $50,000!!!!!! Are you insane!
A No Man’s Sky controversy reference in 2023. Lol
The difference between No Many's Sky and Cyberpunk is that those are video games. The worst that happens is you can't play it. This is a vehicle containing you and your family, and surrounded by other human beings whose lives are dependent on your vehicle operating properly.
Electric cars are useless
SAM
👉🏻🇻🇳🤡
Race to get out a brand new product and then discover why you should never do that with a vehicle.
Paying $50k to be a beta tester blows.
Bring it back, see if they can put their money where their mouth is.
And it’s too HEAVY and is killing AFRICANS who collect the deadly minerals that go into the battery production EVs are gonna hurt INDUSTRY and POLUTE the planet!!!
looks like they copied renault car designs
Anyone else think the volume seemed a little all over the place in this video? The in-car and round-table audio was at one level and the voice-over over the graphics was a different level- just enough that I found myself turning my volume knob between each cut.
Vinfast is a Fail.  Yugo was better.
No car feels good at that point of the 405 no matter how slow you’re going lol
I was walking around the woodlands hills west field out door mall with my dog yesterday and took some Shelter from the heat inside a vinfast store because I have a bulldog that gets hot quickly lol it had two cars sitting in it and the salesperson was obviously not passionate about the car and it made me laugh because I’m so in love and obsessed with my huracan I couldn’t even imagine driving around that piece of trash and she herself admitted she would much much much rather have a huracan or Urus
They said "they eventually got all the bugs worked out. Hopefully, Vinfast can do the same" and I'm thinking, No! I don't hope they can do the same. Companies like this absolutely deserve to fail. We shouldn't allow them to just put out shit products, and "fix it" later. There's no reason to ever trust a company who puts out a car in this condition. Doing something like this should be a death sentence.
So basically it’s a great $15k car then
Once is enough, no more chances please...I had heard and seen videos about it (not test drive or anything, that car sounded awful.
i want to see how well it foes in emergency situations
Vinfast is absolute garbage.  One almost killed a co worker of mine the first day of ownership.  It went back day 2 .  Stay away from this terrible Vietnamese company.  Keep them out of America.  They harass their own citizens for criticizing their shit build quality
You can't blame Vinfast engineers because they have no way to test their cars. Have you seen the roads in Ho Chi Minh city? All the cars are surrounded by motocycles so they look like cockroaches surrounded by ants.
Seems they don't vin fast....
Come to VN and you two will be in jail for the rest of your life because of this video or suddenly disappeared . LOL your names are already in VN CIA list LOL. JK
Pham Nhat Vuong's problem was not creating an army of young male stans to defend every problem with his product like Musk has.
@binhdangvn As a Vietnamese, thanks for your honest review. If we, a Vietnamese reviews as fair as you are, a numerous VinFast fans will curse and yell at me as an evil enemy.  True and it happened. They sued GoGoTV (Youtuber in Viet Nam) for defamation (basically, bad review he gave VinFast). They forced GoGoTV to take down the video on YouTube. Google it yourself. GogoTv vs Vinfast
I hope the review will grow.. this is first model rite, vietnam is the first country in southeast asia that build ev...but eh where is proton?
Obviously invented by monkeys of Vietnam
Not rumor, it is THE SHITTIEST CAR in America. Confirmed. 👍
Yeh underdampened suspensions, just like many Japanese cars today. They just ride cheap.
"SUV" now literally has no meaning.
My opinion as an "old school" Swiss mechanic is: ALL these electric vehicles are junk no matter who makes them... 🤮🤮🤮
Modern cars rely to much on computers and electronics. As someone in the computer field I'm not against computers but they should be in the realm of diagnostics and warnings. A car is a mechanical device. It's controlled by a human. Unless and until the car is 100% autonomous with no manual controls the computer should not override the driver (right or wrong).
Thank you for your honest review. Actually, you were being very charitable and diplomatic in your review. The *US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration* (NHTSA) said 999 of VinFast's VF 8 vehicles suffered a software error in the dashboard display that prevented critical safety information from being shown and "may *increase the risk of a crash* " . *After* NHTSA issued its comment, VinFast recalls its first batch of US-bound EVs over *safety risk* . Nobody should buy this car. VinFast is actually VinTrash 🤣🤣
What a death trap. It makes Tesla look like the safest car maker in the world, and that's saying something.
the only way this car can redeem itself is to self drive into a tesla and burn
Some how when me - a Vietnamese  say about it , another "country lover" idiot attack me on the internet, love how honest you guy are been watching for years
To start the car is really simple...YOU CANT...!!!
I drive buses,  and the way you explained the operation of accelerator sounds the same as the accelerator of a bus.  It takes time to react
sounds like 25000 car not 50000
Anyone who thinks a vehicle should have automatic overides like not changing lanes unless they use a signa is mad. Anyone who needs a machine to correct themselves shouldn't be briving. The ruels of the road are simple. Buckel up. Don't text and drive. Use your signal, yeild,stop, don't speed , don't tailgate and drive according to the weather conditions. 8 simple things that most people say " ehh" to.
I would have thought a vehicle from  China or India would have come first.
What was the "rolling" category? No box was checked
Gimmicks and gizmos doesn't make advanced technology. Did Vinfast engineers actually performed real life testing/driving?
i hate that we are living in a world where cars can be compared to video games
You misspelled "Volkswagen" at 0:39
🙂Greetings! I have noticed at the 14:24 timestamp, it shows the name (volkswagon) when it should be Volkswagen! 🫡I just want to make clear to everyone at Donut Media, that I can spot or pinpoint any misspelled or misspoken words based on the fact that I do really enjoy watching your videos in a detailed manner to really enjoy them! 🤗Me finding things like the ones I have mentioned above, it is just me having fun and letting people involved with Donut Media and the people watching the videos, that you can also have fun  finding things like this and promoting patience, tolerance and understanding in the process! 🕊️🌇May everyone at Donut Media and people reading this or watching the videos have a wonderfully blessed day!
No surprise there.  I lived in Vietnam for a year.  They couldn’t build a decent house; so go figure!  Why would you buy they car???
Yeah, definitely do a follow-up with the new software...
I do think vin was nice to do the money thing
Absolutely dangerous if wont let u turn w out blinker, this is usa, u could have a dig, child, mattress homeless person just appear, and u turn quick, u don't have time to flip breaker and turn! In emergency turn.
Brainchild of the richest man in a communist country... what did you expect?
You can tell the car is made by a communist when the car wont let you change lanes  if you need to lol
It's unfortunate it's so bad, I really hope they can get there issues fixed going into the future. Bad car, but the company seems to take care of its customer base better than most modern manufacturers.
I was watching the videos. The start up chime sounds like an elavator chime.
Saw one of these the other day ...glad i saw this video next
Why spend money on R&D when you can sucker early adopters to do it for you at their cost?
This car sounds like the asian version of the Yugo
$50,000 for Acura RDX or a Vietnamese shoe-box. Easy answer.
a golden rule of cars is it should always do what you tell it to do; accelerate, brake, steer. this fails two of those.
there is a Vinfast dealership in Toronto in the DIxie area. as of right now, they have not sold a single car in the Dixie dealership
just like cyberpunk.. LOL
The pedal response kinda makes a little sense.  It prevents incidental taps from causing inadvertent jerky drive.  1 Second delay seems excessive.  That's probably something they could dial down with a software update.
Is this car an allegory for the jab?
Quik fix   buy a Telsa or Toyota BZ4x  much cheaper
Just call it the No Ping Ping.
Wow that's garbage
The head bobbing is an extra 🤣
I wish Vietnam products well  but pricing on these cars is a joke.
I’d like to drive one for a month and see how it does.
enjoying the suction cup content
I think the chimes are important because it's an electric and not nearly as noisy as a fuel engine. It keeps you awake and attentive.
This certainly feels like an early Hyundai sorta deal. Vinfast will eventually work out the bugs and make it better. Or at least I hope.
Dont take that car to Oklahoma 😂 barf city
Lets see it work out!
I blast very loud electronic music while driving, little beeps are not a problem for me.
No Man's Sky is the shit, now.  It's the only game I play.
Your videos try way too hard to be funny.   And fail.
uncle vin can go after and silence the weak in vietnam but he cant do that shit to people in the west!  now these garbage vinfast is rotting on dealership lots and no one will buy them.  what sweet revenge
Vinfast corporation specializes in deception, and propaganda. Never trust COMMUNIST PARTY
Makes me appreciate my lowly 2013 Chevy Spark THAT MUCH MORE ! And I hope that Flatscreen has more than that stupid/worthless Showroom Display Mode !
ai việt nam ở đây không vào chào nhau cái nhỉ
Xe này ở việt nam cháy nổ rất nhiều rồi  Nhưng vinfast vẫn làm ngơ không thèm quan tâm đến mạng người
Thanks all of you two for an honest review, we Vietnamese people can't actually have such comments like this as we would be sent to jail right after we have a SINGLE negative word on Vinfast
Yeah it’s like a golf cart
You guys kicked the pedal like that ??? Let take a Tesla, Toyota, BYD, Huyndai, Kia, and do the same let see what the cars response.😂 Respect thay you are the fair reviewers. But at this point I can not understand and agree :)
Revenge of the Viet Cong
I don't want a car that looks like it's from the future. Who am I trying to impress? I don't need a bunch of neon lights. Why? I want a reliable car that starts, and gets me to where I want to go. I don't need driver assist, I don't need an infotainment system, I don't need my car to be like my living room if those extras are going to add 10s of thousands of dollars to the sticker price. My biggest problem with EVs is all the luxury whiz-bang electronic extras and emphasis on "cool design" to impress the uncool. I want range, ease of use, and reliability. Unfortunately too many car companies are focused on giving us all the bells and whistles drivable iPads rather than just... cars.
It kinda blows my mind that we’re fixing software bugs in cars nowadays. Car computers used to be about as simple as a calculator, it measured air going into the engine, oxygen coming out and adjusted the fuel accordingly. Now the door handles are computer controlled.
I didnt even know VinFast had finally come to the states. No one out here has bought them yet.  Please do a follow-up and it'll be fascinating to follow the development of these cars.
I have mixed feelings about that blinker one. on one hand, solves the problem of people driving like assholes, on the other hand, thats a huge safety liability if someone gets into an emergency situation.
Now we wait for VinPetrol
Yeah, let's do the update. Would be God to see if the company is for real or if they are just bullshitting.
Lol. As a Vietnamese who don’t give a crap about nationalism and love electric car, I have to say this car sucks after a week of using it.  But criticizing this car within the country will get you beaten by other commenters
Wow, this would be a terrible car to own! I hate so much electronics and this thing is loaded with it. Yes, do an update please.
You should give her one of your beater cars. She'd have a much better experience than that electric chair on wheels death trap.
No amount of persuasion that the problems were fixed is going to get me to buy one of these. It's called reputation.  Too many companies value time-to-market a lot more than quality these days and use apologize for the inconvenience tactics after sale.
American tech is 40 years behind civilised countries, why is there confusion here? Just work with it.
do they still have the monthly sub fees for milage?
driving aids are the WORST feature on new cars these days! they are so unsafe. i hate my 2023 camry that im stuck with. should have stuck with my 23mpg volvo s40, leaps and bounds way better car!
my 2022 corolla doesn't let me switch lanes without blinker to i turned lanes asistams off
Maybe a 6 month follow up should be done, if possible with the same car tested this episode
I’ve got a dodge Journey with a four cylinder and I have better acceleration on hills
Indonesia tertinggal jauh dari Vietnam, konglomerat Indonesia bisanya cuma ngeruk duit rakyat Indonesia saja ga berani bikin hal seperti ini, harusnya kelasnya Djarum Grup, Sinarmas Grup, Salim Grup, Astra Grup, bisalah bikin kek gini.
Software updates and shock replacements might work wonders.  Curious about longevity report in 4 years.
Can you give me this car pleaseee!
if the owners accept their bribes there's no standing for a lawsuit, they're not stupid. This "thing" was rushed to production and is unsafe. They'll hopefully be banned soon.
0:38 Volkswagen*
I'd buy one for the memes.
Buy one VF 8 get free 4 coffins ...ha ha 😂
WOW 5600lbs.  my  ram 2500 has a curb weight of only 300 lbs more......... thats a lot of mass for a passenger vehicle..... But I guess EVs are worth it (NOT)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Does it come with a year's supply of dog meat?
How many members of the Vietnamese communist party were involved in the design and development of this electric coffin?
Even Tom Vu wouldn't own one...
Try again with updates installed!!!
Absolutely do a follow-up!
Car came out too quick and is trying to get to market without thorough testing.
“Just make a car that’s electric powered. You don’t have to make it all weird.” Couldn’t agree with you more. At this point I’d happily pay a premium for that.
Aww   Who else loves the sound from that Mustang GT next door?    NOW that is a REAL car
I actually like the way vinfast is doing it  Most of these failures are mostly minor, so for a company that isn't lacking funds, go ahead and stay production and have the customers help work out the kinks
Vinfast from Vietnam?  wow.. as a neighbor of Vietnam I've never heard of the name Vinfast before, this is strange...how come, enter the American market without entering the Southeast Asian market
It' real! . Like for u.  I form Viet Nam.
This car is a total shit heap and dangerous. It doesn't matter how much you pay,  any car that has that sort of problem with the gas pedal shouldn't be on the road. Also expecting people to pay a huge chunk of money for a car that has major faults is disgusting. I hope the company fails as on their ass.
how did the regulators allow this on the road?
Kia may be crap since 2011 but at least they gave me a 2023 4 runner as a loaner that ive had for 3 months and hope i never have to return 😂 (I'm waiting on a free engine, like 100's of other kia owners in the area)
VF8=POS
Too expensive.
$50K POS 🤣
The way you review is the same way your fathers invaded my country in history.
I want to see an update with the new firmware!
VF8 = Vin Fail 1. Lets see next 7 test.
Do a update on the same exact car if she lets you use it again.
how in the hell are they trying to compete when they are selling them at a higher price when you can get a more reliably made EV for $10K less? Like a Nissan leaf for example.
Porsche start up in my suv was not simple
I think the biggest crime here with this car is that the transmission is done by buttons and not a conventional shifter.
They tried to copy Tesla.
Why are these allowed to be sold in America?
I love how they compared this car to video games.
Three Karen Review…… geezus…
Y'all remember Chevy bolt. Lol. 100 years and they blow up in your driveway.
It took Hyundai TWENTY years from tin can in a box to Car of the Year.  It took Tesla TEN years to producing cars with FINALLY acceptable panel gap.  Yea. making cars is HARD, like, REALLY HARD.  Another me too ain't gonna cut it.
This vehicle needs a bit more development put into it.
Would love to see the follow up
I saw this car on a mall and it was already falling apart
7:00 The steering wheel is off center, really need alignment.
tụi bay dìm hàng quá, toxics
My mother’s Chevrolet traverse cost the same and has heated seats from the back  Ventilation and heated in the front  Step it up vin fast  Or should I say vin slow
You are paying E Class Mercedes money and getting something like a cheap knock off Toyota. That is a tough one to get over before you start on the details!
I'm kind of curious, really, about "Natalie's" decision to purchase this car.
8:25 test how much EMF radiation in there?
A lot of these issues can be fixed with software updates
Where did you borrow the car for the video? It's almost like the company fixed all the major problems before sending you the car. I mean it's donut media the car company isn't going to send a bad car to a influential automotive youtube channel.
History repeating itself. Every time a communist country put out a vehicle its never been good.
I'm poor and drive a 21 year old Honda I've worked hard all my life putting my money in other things but I'd only appreciate this car if it was free.
People complain about no creativity in the car industry but then complain about any new concepts
Wheel problem is the same as Mercedes... A bad one. 6:30
But updates can't really fix the suspension.
No mama sky updated again and it’s popular right now, ofc people will get bored again, but there actually so much to do now
*Wow, thats really a problematic car!* Guess winfast will go bust soon.
Once it earns its HORRIBLE reputation it's too hard to shake. 😂
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can’t wait to your 2nd review after getting updated from manufacturer … Thanks!
So basically instead of a Helicopter mom, it's a Helicopter Car or a Nanny Car.
😂😂😂😂   commie car 😂😂😂😂
What an absolute atrocious name for a car company. " Vinfast " sounds like some late night infomercial product to help you lose weight. I hate electric cars and refuse to own one until I have no option. Ask anyone who works for a power company. Its just cutting the fuel usage in one place, and transferring it to another. I want to hear my engine and be able to have it worked on by myself, or my local mechanic shop I've been loyal to for years. All my friends and family have said they will stick with ICE vehicles also. Used car sales should keep going up. Too expensive to buy 90% of the new cars on the market. Better off buying an older car you really like and doing regular maintenance. That 2500$ engine , or 2000$ tranny , is much cheaper than payments and insurance on these POS modern cars and trucks.
I don't like a car with all the "safety " features, just more crap to fix and a waste of money if you're actively driving and PAYING attention. I swear the driving test alone is far too easy.
Did you guys give the owner 100$ each day after the fourth day of loaning it?
Donut: Please stop saying dumbass things you're not even making sense! VF8: beep beep, boop boop boop, boop boop boop, ding, ding, beep beep
ppl complaing about turn signals.... and prob dont even use them...
This is what happen when you rush  thing and lack experience
50000$ and it looks like a fukin dacia duster...
I do want to see what the 2025 model looks like.
These high tech cars are prone to failure and extremely expensive to fix even for a fender bender. Plus battery tech is not even close to ICE parity. Stick to proven reliable brands like Tesla.
They should do like the chinese and just reverse engineer US and European tech since they already have most of these issues perfected
Can’t change lanes unless you indicate? BMW drivers: What?😮
What is wrong with sound editing, I barely hear a speech and then laud music killing my speakers... WTF!??
When he said Vietnamese made , I was like that’s obviously why it’s so bad.
As bad as these issues are, it’s a new company that’s making an EV and they actually care about solving the car’s issues and trying to keep people driving them. That’s definitely something I can respect.
Paid vinfast car reviewers : this is an amazing car!! Honest reviewers: hold my beer …
IT COMES FROM CHINNNNNNNA
Let’s see a follow up video!!
So if someone in front of you slams on your brakes and you need to swerve into the other lane it won't let you? Instead, you'll just slam into the back of the car in front of you? Great safety feature
The headaches are from the cheap dashboard plastics off gassing lmfao
50k, no thank you
Guy basically kicked hard on the accel pedal multiple times, and expected the car to accelerate. I mean, who the fuck driving like that?
1953: in the future we will have flying cars 2023: cars released in permanent beta
Just buy a used Corolla.
I think it’s just political because this company is Vietnamese.Americans like to destroy others for political reasons..
Not an objective review
"That's in Sport Mode."  🤣
underdamped, not underdampened. Unless you're saying the suspension isn't wet enough :D
Nice paid review.   Oh yes wow! Some of these problems didn’t occur the one time we tried them! That completely invalidates that it ever has happened, people just making things up!
Who would pick this over a model 3 performance🤣
Not saying the car doesn't have issues, but I don't see how it's the cars fault that the idiot holding the key fab forgets he's holding the key fab and can't get the fucking door open. Should probably get someone who isn't completely brain dead to do the vehicle testing.
The laugh after "End quote" made my day!
Sorry but you spend 50,000US on an electric car from a Vietcong maker and it don't work? No surely not.
Only sold in one state -- 3300 miles to the west.
at least read the instruction manual first...ffs
Honda's do somerhibg similar on the highwya with lane assist, without the turn signal on the steering wheel will add resistance and try to turn back into your lane against you, but it's not as dramatic as what you experience.
So it's expensive, weird and annoying, along with being potentially dangerous? Hard pass. Sounds like about 2 to 3 more years of development are in order.  In 6 months to a year, you guys really needs to have another look.
You guys should do a collab with Tom Peng in the follow up vid, he owns all the Vinfast EVs currently on sale
What if you have to react fast and swerve to avoid something...it won't let you unless the blinkers are on? Wow!  China: we make the crappiest cars! Vietnam: hold my rice water
``elec, cars are shit and will always be shit.
Omfg I thought this was a Linus video from the thumbnail
Drivers aids make for terrible drivers.  Trust the car for blind spot, which doesn’t exist if you adjust your mirrors properly.  Trust the car to stop and keep distance automatically.  Trust the car to park itself.  People that like this garbage don’t enjoy driving and should take the bus.  The only technology that has been beneficial is the backup camera as car design today makes it very difficult to judge where the back of the car is.
So glad they pulled out of developing in my country (Australia) They purchased the old Holden proving grounds then sold it...thank god they did.
That dude popping pills lol neck an shoulders Hella skinny
You should do a side by side comparison to a new Tesla Model Y which is now the top selling car model in the world.  Not EV's, all cars.  Look into the new version of Tesla FSD too.  Thank you
What a world when the worst reviewed car is $50k 😂
WHY do some people INSIST on calling the TURN SIGNAL the "Blinker"?!  It's called a TURN SIGNAL; "blinker" sounds so extremely....infantile and ignorant!
As soon as I heard Vietnamese I had heard enough. No communist car for me.
Follow up video!
6:10 so if there's an obstacle in front and you need to swerve to avoid you just get blocked by the car and are forced to crash?
5:45 Ah yes, I'm very familiar with intermittently useless driving assistance features.  In my case, it's a Toyota though.  It can't seem to detect lane lines unless they're nearly perfectly manicured.  The Tesla I drove was muuuuuuuch better at that.
Super cars have some interesting starting sequences.
I suspect that this car is payback for something that Americans did to them a while back. 😳
Read the cars book...set your options  before bitching..
I thought the Vietnam war ended.  If their sales reps are dressed in black wielding AK-47s, I'm going to complain to customer service
Omph Firmware updates done wireless is a huge red flag That means it's closed source programming done through a cloud Which meeeeeeeeeans, when you pair your phone to the car they have the ability to do many nefarious (not good) things such as extract personal information from your phone, encrypt that data, and either use your personal information in a government data base of sell your information to brokers all over the world The fact that this car was allowed into the U.S. tells me that there is a department in the U.S. on a top tier level that is working in conjunction with this supposed vehicle manufacturer  I'm quite familiar with software and programming, and I see visions of Visual Studio Code with firmware commands from Github floating in my head while I'm sleeping  Bottom line, this is a very expensive to the consumer spy device that is a massive breach to digital cyber personal information  I bet you need to register via online before you can own the car and even drive it Red flags everywhere I'd suggest not testing another one of their products  If you really want to start a shit storm pull the ecu and hand it off to a software engineer to see how locked down and nefarious this fancy spy balloon really is Wierd how the U.S. and other countries bent the rules for this company, perhaps a little more research into who they really are and where their money comes from is in order ?
And this is the problem with all these EV companies. They are not building cars, they are building rolling computers.
this is the kind of car that you win at the lottery and you don't even resell it to avoid making an enemy. You give it straight to the junkyard for immediate destruction.
The fact James brought up No man's sky and Cyberpunk means his a man of culture 👑
Is this car payback for the Vietnam War??
It's like this car managed to put all of the features I hate about modern cars in one vehicle.
bad vinfast better take back to china
I test drove it.  It drives much nicer than Model Y.  It has way more features than a Model Y for the price.
Oh yeah. Đánh giá công tâm, mong rằng người tiêu dùng tại VN xem được bài đánh giá này, trừ đám Vinno ra 😂
50 grand for that crap 😂
I say try again 👍🏿
At first when watching donut's video. I am also very unhappy because there are wrong reviews. But when there are reviews, we will see. In fact, VF is a newcomer in the electric car industry. So it will not be possible for other competitors to drown. Simply because VF has done the things that big companies are struggling to develop electric vehicles like GM, damler, VW. Therefore, the beating of the council will be inevitable. But Vietnam's export history has always had an affirmation of quality. In the future, VF will certainly have a certain place. Besides will constantly improve, upgrade quality, to satisfy customers all over the world. Thank you for your comments!
bruh... first step even when u are driving with automatic u hit the brake to change gear why u dont press brake just looking for a button...
"thank you, for lending the car, we're sorry" .. haha priceless!
Awesome video. Definitely give them another shot. Maybe some new tests like cargo capacity, battery range, charging times, launching it, emergency lane changes... 😊
I think I might've missed this part of the video or you left it out. You gave the blinkers a good score, then in another scene on your board you erased it and lowered it but I didn't see that conversation.
A lot of rear end collisions are avoided because the driver was able to hit the gas and get outta the way. A 1 second delay could lead to disaster.
I keep saying this! Make a super cheap EV that literally had just am/fm/cassette and people will buy it!
Yes do a follow up video with the newer car
It looks like a Renault.
Vin fast = vin crash = vin trash!!
Well it just beginning when you owned it and you probably experience more problems down the road
Most of you just don’t understand the Vietnamese mindset. ;-)  Electric cars are a bust for most of the buying public, whether they can truly afford them or not.
Give it another try in 6 months?
I hate these modern AI cars
Totally forgot I had a HRSPWS deficiency
I’ve never been happier to drive a car from 2008
If a electric vehicle it’s way cheaper to make why they charge $50K for it? I would pay for that $8K  and that’s all. Of course it needs to be recharged in 3 minutes ( that’s the time it takes to refuel a gasoline car) and at least 350 miles of range of spirited driving. A/C on included with 4 passengers riding. I’m describing my normal routine with a used Corolla by the way. I don’t understand the reason to have an EV.
Within one minute I was convinced to not buy one. How is it even legal to sell these things in this country? A car that won’t let you avoid a collision without going through the proper procedure? Really? How is this legal??
Looks like most of issues are software related. As a SW engineer, I would say, if they force too hard to deliver an incomplete package, to be sure  it will fail fast.
It looks like they are trying to do an early access car. This isn't steam you cant expect people to live with it while they improve it it needs to be ready day one.
Alarm fatigue is a known hazard in areas that use several important alarms (ICUs, ORs, etc).  When alarms are improperly set and constantly alarm, people tend to get used to them and ignore them.
Any recalls?😂😂
This shows you why established  automakers with almost unlimited R&D funds, took so long to make even decent electric cars trying to catch up to TESLA. It’s freaking difficult.   Comparable to developing a space shuttle. Instead of building 1 shuttle that has a 1000000 subsystems with zero lethal defects, you have to develop a process for making 1000000 cars that have 1000 subsystems with zero lethal defects. And we are used to so much refinement in our car operations.
What’s with the Mr beast thumbnails?
Why not make a simple vehicle  expensive as Henry Ford said a car for everyone
Anyone tried the "accel pedal" as they said? I don't think a normal person will accelerate EV or Gasoline cars as the guys did.
LOSEFAST😂
This car may be garbage, but this video is worse.
who? your mom?
Damn, the video game industry's "launch now, fix it later" approach to consumers,  has come to the car industry... who would've guessed?!
Ultimate theft-proof car.  Dumb criminals cant figure it out and smart criminals avoid it entirely.
I'd rather buy a used 2020 Volvo XC90 plug-in than this crap, it costs the same
Can you do EV SUV comparison for car made in Vietnam vs China?
I am skeptically hopeful for this company, if only for the slim chance they bring the VF3 to the States.
6:27 in the car’s defense, this feature is present in other cars too. i drive an X5 and 3 series and both wouldn’t let me change lanes without turning blinkers on
Never seen or heard of this brand ever..
Hyundai took more than 15 years to get in US market ..Vinfast took about 3 years go to US junk yard .. This is a piece of junk !!!
TSLA:)
Lol, the guy trying to rubbish Tesla in order to make VinFast look good is making want to stay away from electric cars COMPLETELY.
So if a deer jumps out in front of the car, it won't let you steer around it in a hurry.  Like, no, you must hit the deer because you did not use your turn signal.
If I had FU money, I’d get one of these as an ironic collectors item.
A dream car😂
0:39 Volkswagon 😆
0:39 I know Americans have a ridiculous problem with trying to pronounce "Volkswagen" and they often end up pronouncing it as "Voltswagon", but really writing "Volkswagon"? I don't know which editor missed that one, but they shouldn't be getting a cookie with their next coffee.
Lol it feels like cars are being made for kids. All these aids and safety crap isnt needed if you know how to drive I have a 90s japanese car without a single assist and i drive just fine
It’s a Russian car what would you expect
I'm sick of companies "working it out" AFTER selling stuff. Its 2023, this is our new normal? F that
Vinfast VF8 is everywhere in Vietnam, but they have got a problem that’s apparently the AC would automatically turn off when the battery got too hot due to the tropical weather in Vietnam. That annoyed a lot of people here that owns that car
Come on the first test showed how much of an idiot you all are.  Standard to put foot on brake and put knot drive.  Seriously 😳
No offense, but its a Vietnamese car...
There are so many GOOD vehicles to choose from at the 50k mark, why in the world would anyone buy that?
Retards dissing a good car.
Seems like it'd be perfect for drivers ed
Damn. Last time I saw one of donuts videos they had about 350k subs. Look at them now. Holy shit I don’t there’s a group of guys that deserves it like the donut guys.
vinfast sounds like a protein shake
Never in my life would I buy a car from Vietnam 💀
0:38 Ah yes Volkswagon
underdampened suspension... So, they didn't make it wet enough?
So they pay you to keep owning a  💩-T car?
driver aids are such a gimmick and pointless! ive been driving ok for 28 years without them, i dont need them! i bought a brand new car in 21 petrol, with minimal driver aids and electronics, for the purpose of Never going electric!!  i get in, i turn off brake assist, and i turn off stop/start, id rather be in full control thanks! never use brake assist after it emergency stopped on me for NO  reason!! so dangerous
The driving aid not allowing you to change lanes without blinkers is seriously scary! What if you have to avoid a kid or something that's suddenly running out in front of the car? D:
Thank you so much to save people from death in that car
Wasn't the car from the country that did put the imperialistic yankee pride to shame on its knees and not even half of these remarks would've been made from those "journalists".
The acceleration lag and requirement to use a blinker before changing lanes is a real safety issue.  There are obviously times when you need to change lanes AND accelerate while doing so in order to avoid a collision (e.g. a “crash for cash” scammer brake checking you, or a run of the mill moron who changes lanes without looking). The chimes may be cultural. If you watch TV in eastern or SE Asia you’ll hear sound fx being overused so much you’d think you were watching a TV show from 70 years ago -  LOTS of ridiculous wakawaka sound fx.  Get in a taxi and you’ll find drivers who toot their horn EVERY time they approach another vehicle.  [Read Peter Hessler’s “River Town — Two Years on the Yangtze.”  The ridiculous honking he describes still occurs in many parts of China, and I presume Vietnamese drivers are similar.] The suspension is fixable. Back when my dad bought a BMW 2002 such a suspension wasn’t a flaw, it was a feature;  the stiff suspension allowed drivers to “feel the road.”  That phrase was used in many advertisements.
So when does the government get involved in what is sold to the public ?
there needs to be a follow up for this video, you need to keep up with what this company is doing, if anything, to warn people away from them, or see their improvement.   i also challenge you, to rebuild your shitty vinfast from this video, and make it nice. "how to make the sh!77!3st car bearable"
Worst car ever
I can’t believe they want to open a factory in the US to build these things. If they don’t fix their problems they won’t last long in the US.
Thanks for your review
12:41 me who was actually on his way to purchase cyberpunk2077😗😗
Vietnamese revenge for the war ig
They need Follow suit with KiA strategy head hunt Hire an Audi engineer team VinFast is Learning as they go so yes  there's that also I am all for a new Brand Competition is Good though they are overpriced seeing all these problems & knowing their Labor cost is Peanut's in Vietnam Wages the Car brand should aim for a Discount Premium Brand
I’ve never heard of it until seeing this video
If I started a car company, I wouldn’t make a car that looks like every car on the road today. Imagine having a ‘57 Chevy with today’s tech? Maybe a DeLorean? Those are cars that stood out. These? Not so much.
Even worse than Yugo?
I'm Vietnamese, and I'm grateful for your review. Many Vietnamese with extreme nationalism will hurt you with their toxic comments, but a few of us know that you're saving many people from potential accidents. Vinfast pays more attention to marketing and less to product quality, meaning they care about themselves much more than their users.
Gosh I live in Vietnam and worked in VIngroup - most toxic corporate environment ever, with huge turnover of staff and huge penalties for finishing your contract too early. Instead of focusing on small kei-car style vehicles which would be very useful in Vietnamese environment they went with big barges and then made them electric lol no offense but that's so typically vietnamese to have so many good resources and completely waste them. If the managment wasn't so greedy/stupid/criminal they could actually make a good car. I gotta rent myself one of those.
The only way this company is allowed to exist in USA is that they are building EV. IF they built a dependable high mileage great fuel economy diesel engine that was affordable, they would be blocked.
The No Man's Sky comparison is, I think, very apt. They will likely iron out all these issues and might just as well add interesting features at some point to make it a worthy competitor. Looks like they, at the very least, are not just taking the L and are strapping in for a slew of fixes. I can respect that.
Many Vietnamese living in California use nicknames like Americans here. All they need to do is make up bad stories about Vinfast. Don't believe what you read or be guided by what others say. Judge the car for yourself by test driving it.
Great, an Asian car that leaves the turn signal on for you. Who knew?
EV. nough said. They are toys. Just read an article about a  EV Rivian owner who got into a fender bender that would be a 1600 dollar ish repair on a real car, the price tag was 42000 dollars for the repairs. It damaged some electrical part that went from the back of the EV to the front. The entire roof had to  be disassembled to repair it. Maybe if we had taken all the money given to Ukraine we could have built some sort of standardized infrastructure for charging. But the out of date power grid cant handle hot days at current loads. They are less "environmentally " friendly the ICE vehicles. The only thing EV will do is slow us down, end travel as we know it, and increase cost across all  aspects of vehicle ownership. In fact owners will only be the rich as the common man wont be able to afford the cost of ownership for the life of the car.
Honestly I think it's a decent business move for an up and coming car manufacturer to release a car before ride quality is fully tuned and promise/deliver software fixes or compensation/physical repairs. Crowd testing while you make money on the car sales.  Edit: Still a rude move regardless.
In VN if you review bad about vinfast , you may be sued 🌝 thank you so much for telling the true
Yes a follow-up please.
Lane departure assist is problematic in my Acura as well.  I just shut it off.  I don't like the car fighting me if I start to get over a split second before I hit the blinker.
Vinfast is a bunch of Vietnamese communist thieves, they knew nothing about cars to begin with.  Thanks for the honest review.
I'm honestly hopeful: new brand could mean new competition. It gave me an idea I hope you guys see: make a series of videos going to Europe & Asia to test different offerings from car companies that don't sell here and decide if you wish the company was offered in the states. If you share my opinion, it could highlight how companies here have become uncompetitive & uninnovative by choking out competition in the US
For right now, I'm avoiding all EV's for a long, long time.   I like my 2010 Yaris and my recently purchased but needs worked on, 2004 GMC Sierra.  Those two I understand.  The EV's have yet to attract my attention except to avoid them.
1) I've never known anyone to get sick from "over sprung" and/or "underdamped" suspensions. Tens of millions of Americans would have been uncontrollably upchucking whilst navigating at freeway speeds in millions of 60's & 70's pickups & delivery vehicles in different states of loading/overloading and towing conditions. The three of you guys weigh about as much as six Vietnamese dudes, maybe they didn't account for that😁 2) Perhaps there's some weird VinFast interior out gassing that becomes barf-worthy with time. A few minutes with the windows rolled down would address that. 3) If you knew there was a software update (during "filming") why did you not explain why you couldn't obtain or load it? 4) Why is one of those guys chewing gum all the time during the in-car shots?
early access car
You lost me me at "Software Updates".
They launching the car like they launching a phone apps.. different is.. nobody gets injuries or killed with u buggy apps.. but car however….
Buy from cheap arse Asian monkey  countries..  Get cheap arse Asian monkey vehicles..  It ain't rocket 🚀 science
I have an idea. If you are a startup car company, how about making no frills affordable transportation starting under 15k. The world does not need any more 50k electric vehicles but there is a whole segment of the market that is absolutely priced out of vehicles. You used to be able to find a Chevy Cavalier, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Echo, maybe a really good used Saturn that were excellent starter vehicles. Kia don’t make the Rio anymore, the Hyundai doesn’t make the accent. Honda don’t make the Fit and Toyota doesn’t make the Yaris. A Mitsubishi Mirage starts at 19k. It’s scary because transportation is a necessity, public transit isn’t available a lot of places. The small car budget conscious segment is wide open for someone to come in and take
"in hindsight, it's pretty intuitive" . . . classic
This car is wild as hell
Thst gum chewing or wherever tf was in his mouth was disgusting. I couldn't finish it sorry
I guess it's anti theft if no one can figure out how to turn it on
This car is just chinese parts assembled in vietnam so i don't know what you were expecting.
Honestly I was half expecting vinfast to be a car company started by vin diesel
❤❤❤ thank you
Oh my god the driving assist thing with the turn signal is horrendous!!! What if you needed to make an emergency evasive manuever?!?!
Wow I just love to watch people chew gum with their mouth open, and the look of having just jumped out of bed, just top class TV.
So FIAT/Chrysler (insert model here) has been bumped off its throne? Well I'm sure Chrysler will find a way to reclaim it's spot. Cheers!
yes do another review pleaseeeeeee
tôi chỉ thấy một bộ phận người gốc Việt định cư ở Cali toàn đưa ra các nhận xét không chính xác về hãng xe cũng như mẫu xe này
I have a Toyota Auris, and I just turn off most of its safety features. I received too many false positives where the car screamed at me to brake, when there was nothing significant going on (e.g. I was entering a dual carriageway and had built up too much speed on the slip road for the traffic, a car was slowing down in front of me and I started slowing as well. Then the system kicked in and told me to brake). Luckily the car won't stop me from making a sudden manouvre (as much as it won't appreciate it) if there's an emergency.   That steering lock without an indicator is dangerous. As much as it shouldn't be necessary to perform, we're only human and shit happens.
Well, that is a piece of crap. But it's still better than Dacia :D
I think vinfast took the whole family guy asian woman not using blinkers meme personally.
This car drives and feels like a semi but smaller
VinFast has the dream to achieve success in the American car Markets, the idea is not so wrong. But VF products need ton of works to get there for a bigger business. That is real deal.
The reviewers are more annoying than the car.  You guys complained more than necessary
Cars SUVs and vans of the last  10 years the turn signals front back have got smaller and smaller., reset into a cylinder of  plastic. All cars have indicators do the humans use them, no.
Drive the pain car more. Maybe it won’t cause pain this time.
For 50k i would certainly buy a proven gas vehicle.
Instead of doing a “ if they fix the car they keep it” do if they can’t start the VinFast and outrun Jeremiah on little red” they can keep it
If the Vinfast had a steering wheel that was a PlayStation controller it would be on the same build quality level as Oceangate Sub
10:12 I'm pretty familiar with those kinds of "compensations", 8 years in Vinfastland ❤
I like how they act like they are the first time in a car... lane keep assist doesn't let you switch lanes if you don't have a turn signal on in bmw and mercedes as well...
lol Vietnam
You didn’t know it had a turbo electric motor so it takes time to spool 🧵 11:36
Do not trust software updates! I bet they will not resolve anything. Just empty promises to that they will do something when the probably will not.
All new cars with lane assist don't let you pass someone, unless you use your blinkers.
Cars compared to video games?  I wish all you young people luck considering the fact that you’re being lied to about what progress actually is. EV’s without at least 500-600 miles range with a reliable fast charging network are a bust and quite frankly there isn’t an electrical grid that can support these “cars”. At this point EV’s without nuclear power are not just a non starter, but another left wing scam.
Read the manual!
Buy VF8 you got a wrench 8
You know what's funny in this review? At the minute 11:39 , he cited vf8 error from a youtuber named tom peng... 7 months ago, and do you know how many ev vinfast that guy has now? - 5 cars: vfe34, 2 x vf5, vf8, vf9. If you notice these guys are constantly renaming the car review categories. And I wonder why they didn't interview the feelings of the car owner - Ms. Lee. Or they don't dare to do it when it might be a huge contrast to their sensational reviews.
MG: Hold my beer
You bought a turd Natalie 😂
Seriously before a single review who would buy an EV from Vietnam with a stated 250 mile range?  The idea that an unknown car maker from a country with no history in car making that introduces an EV at an equal price point to companies that at least have a network is insane. I’m not buying any EV and certainly nor this thing.
At $50.000 I'd probably just go for the boring option.. and get a Tesla..
How did these cars even get on the road in the first place?
Solid 1/10
This would be bad for any car, but for that price? That's ridiculous!
🤣😂 gas pedal definitely not responding 🤣😂🤣
Honestly every time I drive an electric car like any kind Tesla, Chevy, etc and definitely feel nauseous at first
Cars should be easy to use No discussion
What happened to the sunroof review on the board? it seems to have disappeared further down the review 🙃
If I had 50K I'm willing to bet I could buy at least 40 different gas powered vehicles on Facebook marketplace that run better than an electric car and that would last longer with minimum maintenence😂 Cudos to some electric cars though for looks but I really wouldn't want to own one plus gas powered are easier to work on since it's actual mechanical parts and not all coding since you can't exactly work on an electric car on the side of the road unless your changing a tire
we hate it in our country.
LOL
Cars are not toys. Not a videogame either! Except for small children, everyone knew that. Now even care manufacturers don't know that.  Give me a v8 Chevy Blazer from 1980 anyday!
The blinker sounds the same of a Mack truck GU813's blinker
Today, I got to my job, driving 50 kilometres on my Alfa Romeo 75 1800,  1991 model. Beautiful design, RWD and an engine that sounds like an orchestra of classical music. And the most impostant thing of all....when I leave her (not "it") in the parking, I always turn my head, take a look and smile! No EV will ever make feel in such a way! Great video. Greetings from Greece.
Obviously this is the start of a plot to get you back for the 20 years from 1955 :)
50 thousand lol lol lol
rushing to deliver this total crap to the US becasue they need money by IPO Vinfast so bad
i could see this being practical in Asia as they tend to drive a lot closer to one another.
goofy ass ewaste
you'll soon be locked up man, good luck :j
Vinfast pt 2 i love healthy competition
Fair review as always ,, love the donut fam ✊🏿🤙🏾
My 30 year old car has been broken for 3 months now, I'd love to drive that !
This was fun.  Give Vinfast another chance in a month or two.  It will be fun.🎉
Still better than a chrysler product
follow up please :)
50 grand 😂 it’s not worth it guy
This thing could light up and burn like those e-scooters sometimes do. No thank you!
11:16 PEEP THE 10TH GEN SI
Drive it again. I dare you. Lol
Please do a follow up! I'm curious to see if these issues are actually fixed! Would be an awesome video to compare to this one and see what happens!
I don't want to go full tin hat, but this car seems like it's the future, where you have zero control.
Hi Donut; love the video-- holy sh*t though--- the audio levels on this video are insane!!!! Headphone blowout to whisper quiet between different cameras and mics. Please normalize!!
Those EVs are cancer causer  machines. Not supposed to be sitting next to huge high voltage batteries.
i think it has potential but this is kinda like the opposite of tesla right where tesla tried to creat a few limited high performing EXPENSIVE EV's to get big pockets to back Tesla. this car tried to go full production to fund itself which is pretty unsafe. they didn't refine they didn't create a consistant product. but I do think maybe it has potential. I do think it has a nice look but why wouldn't I just go and buy a tried and true product for 50k.
Imagine trying to avoid a collision and you have to get airlifted to a hospital because you didn’t turn your blinker on
It's the usa that started with the annoying chimes. Put the key in the ignition: chime, open the door: chime, ... STOP IT But then again, we're used to people from the usa to being annoying.
Yeah, I definitely want to see a follow up
Did you used your old face in the thumbnail
when your car is alerting you to EVERYTHING it is alerting you to nothing. and I feel like that will jsut make you worse over time as you start to ignore everything. the chimes is crazy. cars trying to do too much.
As a software dev, I am terrified that we start building cars the same way we build software
tucker carlson is right!
me: "mom can we have tesla?" mom: "we have tesla at home" tesla at home:
Goodbye Vinfast for this year 🙏🏼 Good luck for the next Gen ❤ From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
0:39 Volkswagon? 🤣🤣
VFe34, VF8 had lot of troubles in VietNam, so do VF8 in America. VF3, VF5, VF6, VF7, VF9 was a clone of VFe34 and VF8 basically. I'm Vietnamese, I'm living at VietNam, I knew Vinfast - Vingroup which bad company, they controlled medias, socials, newspapers to get good news. One of big company was really really bad 😊😅😂🎉
what the fuck even cars have post launch patches now?
What about the rooftop though?
Electronic Arts would be proud...
Italian exterior design, Vietnamese quality
Asian looks with Russian reliability and German pricing.... Interesting business model...
As soon as you said "electric" I immediately knew it was GARBAGE. ALL battery powered toy cars are GARBAGE, unless they are 10 inches long and use four C batteries. I had a lot of those 50+ years ago, and they were great fun.
Hãng xe Việt Nam này tôi rất sợ! Rất nguy hiểm, xe có rất nhiều lỗi nên cân nhắc trước khi mua nó.
Please do an update as a Vietnamese myself I know how our people is like. Sometimes we put shit together and it kinda works and be like “Du ma” forget about it maybe nobody find out type of shit if they do we fix it later same shit.  So I’m really hoping vinf get their shit together and make things right like the American way. No more of that “Du maaaaa” shit
I used to to crack on Tesla for using customers as beta testers, but VinFast takes the cake for delivering unfinished and downright dangerous software.  That overly zealous lane keep feature which prevents evasive maneuvers is mind blowing in that it was not identified and fixed before the first customer unit shipped.  Inexcusable.
This reminds me of the Model S when Tesla first released them
Runs on pho
Barrage of sounds .. hahahaha... come and live in Vietnam :)
You guys should have cooler cosmetics on Forza Horizon 5
please make part 2 after update
chinese made - Lil-china import and rename to VF. Just a kind of money wash.
The miserable throttle lag seems like a hack to cover a problem with the motor drive such as under-sized IGBTs or other components that can’t handle the peak current.
I drove a rental Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid that tried not to allow me to change lanes or even turn without having a turn signal on, even when there were no other vehicles on the road.  I pulled over and figured out how to disable driver "assist".  That "safety" feature needs to go away.  And yes, please do an update on the Vinfast.
As a Vietnamese I could have told you about this train wreck
I got to see inside a VF8 at the county fair last year. I could tell how terrible the car was just looking at the shoddy caulking under the hood. And this was a model put on display by Vinfast itself.
Cars are becoming shittier and shittier. You get less car and more mockup "tech" nowadays.
Isn't that the car Walter White is driving in Breaking Bad? 😂
❤❤❤ From Viet nam
It's time to retaliate against that company.  If you own one of these cars, please report every single thing as a type one issue that you can possibly think of. The more money you get from the company, the more money they lose.
I have a rav4,  and it's frustrating that it tells me to take a rest,  but otherwise it's an awesome car.
50 grand for a 20k car..... wtf
All the alerts while driving? Isn’t this a good thing for the Asian market?
My suggestion I rather buy a BYD china made car than this one.
Who care its the worst car when you have family. Hello? Vin-Fast, sound familiar?
You did them dirty by having the “the issues are actually fixed” portion in the last 30 seconds of the video
id love for you guys to have a fleet of random never seen china cars just absolutely modded into some of the craziest builds ever
SUV?
is it as bad as a hellcat?
Those issues are  unforgivable  in my opinion where at the time now there are car makers  who have even better and more solid products  that cost less than this Vinfast. Things like the suspension  etc cannit be easily fix by thru air updates
👏👏👏 👍
Mercedes starts the same way
Love how software updates will add parts to the car.
just buy a model Y and be done with it
Honest reviewer ever, this is so true :D
Rushed to the finish line like No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077 or The Jab 2020
Should start a go fund me for the person who loaned you their car to make this video so she can get a new car.
You can't turn without using your turn signals? So if you have to swerve around someone quickly to avoid an accident from happening you have to use your turn signals to do it?
90 seconds is all I could take of this headache-inducing video!  Shame, cos I was interested. Should carry an epilepsy warning!
Never been car sick in my whole life I don’t believe it’s a real thing
This car was probably only bought by Vietnamese and Pho lovers.
man this car is total dogshit, it can get you killed.
not being easy to figure out how to start IS A GOOD THING.  If you're the owner you only need to figure it once, who else has to try to figure it out?  random car thieves.  If they can't figure it out, good!
I sincerely believe I know of a few hundred drivers who should absolutely drive that car with the driver aids in it's "unfixed" state. The number of people in my city who tailgate, run through roundabouts, and do not signal, and also don't watch for pedestrians, is WAY too high. And they would actually need that many chimes just to avoid a collision.
binfast!
How much money Tesla pay for you?
All they needed to do was create an Affordable dependable car for $15,000 without all the bells and whistles, and all the computer problems that are sure to arise. It's a piece of JUNK.
Honestly cars nowadays just have to much useless technology and touchscreens in them. Nobody just makes a normal car anymore.
2 idiots
What if you have to switch lanes in an emergency?
Lol part 2 please
Never heard of it.
Sorry I won’t be buying a Vietnamese car ever. Also, if your car needs a software update to fix anything major, then it’s not a car worth owning or driving. Luckily I drive a 32 year old Toyota that’s mechanical and nothing needs an update to work properly. And it was not even a quarter of 50 grand.
I was hanging out for the sunroof test then it mysteriously disappeared.
you guys joke, but if tesla had offered anything like the $100 a day over 3 days that your car is in the shop they would have a lot less PO'd customers on their hands. Instead, they just keep charging people for the autodrive subscription, no matter how long your car is sitting in the shop!
It's these kinds of electric cars that make Petrolheads refuse all the time to even try to understand an electric/hybrid car.
Car starting is one time problem or to say you must read manual or ask the dealer ..  car reviewer making a big issue😂😂
sản phẩm núp sau lòng yêu nước là 1 sp thất bại
I'd like to see the Vinfast story followed up on.
I hate this car, just for the stupid design
VF8 isn't the flagship, that would be the VF9, if I could I'd add a pic of it, it's huge. Their first cars the Lux A and Lux SA were based on the old 5 Series BMW and X5 respectively, with the BMW N20 Turbo engine, they had worked on new updated designs for these models before the choice was made to abandon internal combustion engines and go all out into the EV market.
Just got off forza and YouTube recommendations is actually good
Nếu ở Việt Nam thì chủ kênh này sẽ bị Vinfast kiện và có thể đi tù r 🤣🤣 sang Mỹ thì ng ta dám nói thẳng nói thật lắm Vinfast ơi, ko lấp liếm được đâu. sản phẩm ko ra gì thì sẽ bị quay lưng thôi, ko có lòng yêu nước nào giúp đc ở đây đâu 🙂
Several times in my life I've had to swerve suddenly to avoid hitting a child or dog after they ran out onto the road, I never hit them because there was an instant response when I swerved. I cannot imagine the consequences of having the car stopping me from swerving and if I had actually hit a child I would possibly have spent a couple of years in prison if there was a fatality. If the car stopped me from swerving, who is to blame? The designer maybe? The software engineer? The person who sold the car knowing it has this design defect? Certainly the manufacturer would be to blame, though I'm not sure if the car is available as a right hand drive vehicle, I'm sure it would be illegal to sell it as a left hand drive car in my country.  Being able to change lanes suddenly is a basic safety issue, if I need to swerve I'm not going to apply the blinkers first, I'm just going to swerve. Not being able to is dangerous.
Who pays 50k for a new company car lol
Ok so I would say junk
Still going to stick to my crown vic I bought at the auction as a daily driving car. No nonsense and just works
Still going to stick to my crown vic I bought at the auction as a daily driving car. No nonsense and just works
People don't disable all driving aids  the moment they buy the car wtf
In the cars defense it's probably makes more since to have the throttle be a little laggy so the ride isn't more twitchy than to have it be responsive and shaking violently as you mud stomp the peddle
Why on earth do we need another country's car, after decades of proven reliabilty from Japan? Vietnam now? Really? FFS.... I must be invisible here too huh. Just love Youtube, soooooo much.
Pfizer made this car.
fyi : they just "assemble" combustion cars since 2018 , then they killed those cars to switch to assemble EV cars two years later. Obviuosly you can tell how bad the product can be , they always want to try shortcuts to make a quick buck , feel sorry for those guinea pigs. They cant even  sell cars in their own country , imagine that. never listen that whatever comes for that country , its all about propangada, just talk.
My sisters brand new Outback beeps more than this car. It’s unbelievably annoying. this car doesn’t beep nearly as much
this video still not answers the main question - WHO/WHY buys them?
Never heard of it
I’ll pay $5,000, that’s how much it’s actually worth.
Or the Titan submersible.
Give it another run!
IT'S A DEATH TRAP CAR OR SHIT  CAR 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😅😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊
Communist car
The police will arrest anyone who gives complaints to this car in Vietnam - a communist country 😂
the hardest business to get into in america is automotive and this guys messed up big time with their first impression. I doubt they will survive for long in usa.
chimes are a big thing in chinese cars, wouldn't be surprised if there are some chinese software bits.
As a Vietnamese who has fed up with headlines about how amazing it was and how much it being sold, this is the thing that not just me but pretty sure alot of Vietnamese would like to see. So i really appreciate your honesty
The pedal delay was bad to the point of being a safety issue.
Maybe too ambitious for Vietnamese manufacturing "prowess" .... Be careful Apple...if you move iPhone production from China to Vietnam. Also, I imagine they built the factory and ramped up production during the worst bits of COVID. Not good. Perhaps for the time being they should stick to t-shirts and Nike's budget sneaker line....Update:  Made In North Carolina????....that actually changes nothing about my comment
Nothing Vietnamese made is worth 50k.
The Chime from ELK features (Emergency lane keeping) so if you turn on High way assistance the chime will not warning :))
But is it worse than a Toyota? Cuz... I don't see how that's possible.
The car is in early access
Junk car of communists
Total shitbox ..Dump it ..
no shit sherlock. i saw this in person at san mateo. man they have the italian interior. i was fucking shock when it came from vietnamese. but their engine is from bmw
So many idiots don't bother to read a cars owners manual.
Junk
Poor Natalie!!! I hope she doesn't see this video!😂
What surprises me is the $50K MSRP. Assembly line labor in Vietnam is probably $2.50 an hour. Pass the savings on to the buyer?
1:35 why I hate Tesla. Try change the mirrors or the vents some things need to stay tactile with knobs and buttons. Its a machine not a toy.
Thanks     <<< Donut      {  Video  👍 }
Its kinda funny that you compared the car to the gaming industry at the end... What a crazy timeline we live in
So this car was approved by the Dept of Transportation?!
both of these guys energy felt off in this video. i wonder if they're in the middle of contract negotiations, it feels like that.
rough start aside, i think it's exciting to see another country getting in the game. i sincerely wish them well
Its design language is stolen from renault, u can easily put renault badge aka the diamond of doom and just make everyone think u are driving an electric renault than vinfast or whatever it is lol
Another video!!!! Please
It’s insane to me that cars have updates now. “Bro turn on your car new update came out”
I've been super curious about vinfast so thanks guys for test driving this for us
<< You buy  this  Car ....VinF***   vf 8  >..the Car -Company  Gives  YOU    A  Hero Badge🤣  (((  .. Donkey
This car is a mobile casket LOL.
If it is going vs the Chinese version of the Volkswagen ID4 the VOLKSWAGON… 😂then there is no match!
not wanting to defend vinfast in anyway, but something to keep in mind is that most issue where on pre-production model
every dodge ive driven has had similar accelerator lag
subscribed.  you guys are awesome.  Nice video and everything is all fact.
They are trying to get into IPO in the US but failed multiple times. They cut off the time to get into the market to collect money. They did silence all bad reviews in Vietnam, they are a part of the Vietnamese Government. Please don’t let them silence you guys by money.
Volkswagon?
Firmware is one thing, physical issues are a whole other issue...
don't expect it to get better.  Vingroup is terrible at service or generally caring about their customers.  The company more or less owns the government here, they don't give a damn about anything
You don't have quality standards there?
Natalie thank you and sorry😊
I heard about your channel from the others after this video. You got my subscribed and liked.
Don't even bother to to a follow up.  No one will buy this piece of crap unless you are Vietnamese, want to support your country and you don't care wasting a bunch of money!
Made in Vietnam. I’ll pass.
I really want VinFast to do well but it seems it's go so many bells and whistles. I assume it's because it's the top of the line flagship model, but I really want them to get all the basics right first before trying to put in all these fancy features and getting them right.
Wait you have to have your seatbelt on to turn the car on? Im out on this thats entirly unreasonable.
Lol Lucids shutdown and go into turtle mode all the time. And they start at 87K!!!!!!
Car should be 25k to buy...
a tuff start up is just anti theft
"How long does it take to start it?"  Trick question.  One does not actually "start" an electric car 🤷‍♂️
I support Vietnam, but not spending $50k on any car.
yes! please do! thats crazy!
It's sad that we car guys are now comparing cars to dogshit AAA games
Okay, I just want to say, it isn't fair to compare No Man's sky and cyberpunk to this POS car, the developers didn't actually want to release those games when they did, Sony forced hello games to release No Man's Sky early and threatened them with legal action, citing contract violations if they didn't release it when they did, then they threw hello games under the bus and removed it from their exclusive lineup when it wasn't received well. At least this went well for Hello games because it meant they could expand their customer base and it's won multiple awards since. Cyberpunk was in development for 9 YEARS, the company and its investors were sick of throwing money at it and wanted to start making money off of it (also gamers were complaining a lot about how long it was taking), it was an overly ambitious project to begin with but with less bugs than a Bethesda game at release that actually got fixed instead of calling it a "feature", it was at least a complete game but it was by no means "rushed to the finish line".
Do a followup please!
The vinvast is not smarter than Nolan, and even nolan is not that dumb….
It's your own fault when you buy a car from Vietnam
50k are they crazy?
I had one of the first Mazda CX30’s.  It was awful - the adaptive cruise didn’t work right the a/c didn’t work right, the lane centering was off - I thought I made a major mistake.  I took it the dealer and they did a reboot from the factory and suddenly all the problems that I had with it were gone.  They updated like five or six things.  It’s too bad but first buyers of anything are the ‘beta’ testers.  My current Volvo XC60 is the same way they are on version 2.10 of software updates ….. def. do a repreat.  Love your channel BTW - Jackson
Just get yourself a Toyota 🤷
Damp, not dampened.  Being semantic.
To give them a lot fo credit, I have never heard of any other car company giving you anything at all as compensation for inconvenience or actual repair time.  Otherwise, yes, do a follow-up and also a comparison to some of the more annoying (and somewhat dangerous) dumb features other companies put in their vehicles (looking at you Ford Transit with your flashing alarm noises that distract you in an attempt to warn you about impending impacts)... in fact, a completely separate video about these "driver aids" that are anything but might be cool too.
But it still a good cars :-)) and i think Vinfast will fix something about software in the feature.
Make the second video and do stitches of this video... I would love to see how the updates remedied the situation
LOL, if this is how the vehicle is brand new, imagine after it has some miles / age on it… I have a 2002 Toyota Camry SE with 282k miles on it.. runs fine.. and everything works 😆
If the passengers feel nauseous/uncomfortable, that means terrible engineering on Vinfast's side. The suspension system of a passenger car is usually tuned for comfort. Feeling seasick in a car for example means that vibrations around 0.2 Hz are not well dampened, which was a problem solved decades ago. Other vibration frequencies can also annoy your eyes, nose or heart. There is a set of frequencies that the car's suspension system should handle very well, and therefore the car should be tested against. I don't think such a small company owns all the needed test benches for that. But they can at least get their prototypes tested at big manufacturers' facilities or universities for the final tuning of the suspension system.
😂😂 as an American who lived there for 4 1/2 years. Returning in 2021 once Covid caused the country to just crumble. Man Vin owns everything there and everything locals do is half azz, I remember if you worked at VinFast you were FORCED to buy their vehicle. Just like you read the comments from Vietnam saying how they can say certain stuff. Their so brainwashed there 😭
"Hey, you want to lend us your car so we can make a video about how totally horrible it is?" "ok, sure 😭"
How the fuck is this car street legal with that lane change prevention nonsense (not to mention other issues)?
What is a vinfast? Lol
Communists doing capitalism. Hmmmm.
On the plus side, this car is its own anti-theft mechanism. On the minus side, you're then stuck with the car.
13:11 I got jump scared by his great hair I thought he was a different person for a second
It's a crappy car. Trust me bro I'm Vietnamese
You better hire a lawyer now. Or Vinfast will call the Cop. "Social media has become the default venue for customers with a bone to pick about bad quality or poor customer service. For better or worse, it allows people to share their negative experiences with a wide audience, ostensibly in the hope that they will see their concerns addressed. Unfortunately, that wasn't so for Vietnamese YouTuber Tran Van Hoang, who found himself in legal trouble after the automaker VinFast called the police on him after he posted a video critical of his new VinFast Lux A2.0 luxury sedan, Reuter report."
The chimes and driver assist is enough to make a person walk!
Vinfast won't last
50k for this tiny POS. Wow!
You know the thing that annoys me about all these small car start ups is it's like they just don't get what they are really up against. Like love them or hate them you are up against massive companies some with literally over a hundred years experience, And in that time being JUST as groundbreaking and innovative as you think you are. Did they stop innovating as much and turn shitty in a lot of ways? oh sure. But, to not take the time to properly really do something when they are up against companies like that is almost just like asking for them to just kinda sigh get up and be like fine..You want to see what experience can do?
Americans are just brats and pampered.
DONUT REVIEWS LIKE A DUMB DONUT.  NOTHING HONEST BUT SMEARING A NEW BRAND with SHALLOW  AND STUPID PREJUDICE.
My brand new electric Vauxhall was in for repair of systems issues for 5 weeks. If they gave me the same compensation as Vin give Id be 3200 dollars richer 🤔
WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE! It makes the Mitsubishi Mirage, which got some of the worst reviews I've ever read, seem like a great car! Also, what IS the matter with manufacturers who make hard to use EVs? Notice how almost none of the gearshifts are intuitive like the old-style ICE ones? Hey dummies, give me a regular T-shifter between the seats with a push button, or a column shifter from a Buick and PRND! This is not hard guys!
Over priced I would not buy it for a dollar
These are nice cars ! why the hate ?
vinvast is a tax avoidance scam
Fken 50K for a viet car 🤣 gtfo
So the DOT is ok with this Amazon-grade car but I can't import a JDM unless it's 25-yo? Ok, just checking.
Why can't we just have a simple no frills no bs electric car? Even no electric windows type of thing.
please test again the car seems good
Failed the iihs headrest crash test too the thing snapped off and broke the dummy’s neck
Their special after sale whatever program is so vietnamese 😂😂
I couldn't finish watching the video seemed like they really wanted to hate the car from the beginning
I think you should have checked the blinker fluid before you tested the vehicle.
is a glass/plastic roof of the car cheaper then a metal one?
yeahh they got some work to do.  at first i was like oh.. cool,  a veitnamese company's bringing over a lower cost EVt o america, neato!  .. uhh nope.   if they can fix the issues, and get it close to or under  $30k,  they'll have a market here.
1:30 usualy the dealer shows you all that so thats a non issue. actually good as the thief or car jacker wont get the car.
It seems Vinfast can't sue and silent the American like they've been doing with the Vietnamese.
Imagine wanting to buy an EV that relies on AI to get you out of trouble.    Hard pass
VinFast is piece of junk communist vehicle. Do not buy.
And that's why I'm not a huge fan of tech heavy cars and this is coming from someone who likes tech. I'm old school, I like tech and I like to control it myself, if I'm to make a mistake it better be made by me and not because of a bug. That's why I prefer cars from the late 90s - early 2010s, they got all you need, fairly safe and no fancy assists, just your classic ABS, TCS, Cruise Control etc.
I don't want an electric car. I want a classic car converted to electric. All the good with none of the bad
as a Vietnamese, all I could tell is that not " many " indeed car enthusiasts here in Vietnam would ever spend that amount of money for a " patriotic " car then just to be forced to give a positive review to a thing that does not deserve it. And by " many " I mean rarely or mostly wealthy people whose only purpose is to show off how " well " they've spent their money and their knowledge about " luxury cars" can be summed up to just about the size of their driver's license lol.
Bro you gotta be a pretty bad fucking company to copy Hyundai/Kia & fail at it.
When Vietnam wanted to make money but prank Americans 😂😂😂😂 Haha jokes on you I drive a Honda civic. Or more like they thought of Nixon while they built this car for America oh you thought the war on Vietnam was funny.....
2:30 in and I already doubt this. What the fuck kind of startup process is that. This vehicle is very laughable.
What a POS at such an expensive price. This is a 10K car at most, and even then I could not live with what these issues are.
money is not going ot solve the car sickness unless you can get better shocks.
Never buy a car the first year of vehicle production.  There will bugs in system.
How about Vinfast partner with you'll and do a series of test?
On your argument about Cyberpunk and No Mans Sky being released the same way, too early and with too many bugs that eventually got worked out, I agree that this car COULD be made better. But it's already annoying to gamers worldwide that games like Cyberpunk and No Mans Sky can be released the way that they are and still be charged full price for them. With cars it's not that it's annoying, it's that it's *_dangerous._* This sort of behavior shouldn't be tolerated by the game developers that are already doing it and it shouldn't be ALLOWED from something as dangerous and expensive as a car, and something as novel as an electric car.
Wow my Nissan Sentra B14 is better than that Car.
literally just looks like a tesla screen lol
was this the company that tried to sell the vehicle and main battery seperately, that you lease the battery from the company and even if you own the vehicle, if you stop paying for the battery they'd remotely disable your car
Aw, poor little babies, all used to super cushy buttery leather seats with heat and ac in them and super duper shock absorbers to keep your guts from giggling around.  Try driving or riding in the back of a Chevy Citation, or a Ford Pinto, a Dodge Neon, or a Yugo!!!   That Vinfast is a freeking Cadillac compared to those death traps!
The worst car ever! Boycott this car no communist in USA🇺🇸
I bought a used 2019 Audi A7 for the amount of money this car costs and I am firm in my belief that between these two options, I made the correct choice.
If it's $30000 or less than it's understandable. You pay for what you get, but for $50000 for this crap?
Not allowing you to turn without using the blinker could get you killed.  They don't have any adults supervising the design decisions?
Tiring.
Trying to fix an engineering issue with a software update. No thank you. Ask Boeing how well that worked for them.
So interesting. I live in Vietnam and these cars are everywhere. The rules of the road don't seem to exist here so hardly any of the taxi drivers need their indicators to turn. I never hear the senses and the car doesn't vibrate when in reverse. I guess it would be easier for me to chip in if I had actually driven one. But from what I've experienced as a passenger it's always been fine. 🇻🇳
All I see is more evidence that these EVs are not the way of the future.
Four of those came through our town and looked kinda neat. I posted pics on r/Vinfast and their own forum downvoted it.
why you guys don't ever mention @tesla ?
My man be hear literally comparing 2 video games that I have that launched in a horrible state of release
That's not the Pontiac Aztec
Takes more than a minute to start my car from 1988 on cold mornings
I haven't heard of it until now but how could they even hope to sell it with more established cars selling for less?  IF they came over with a low cost, high MPG little 8 ft bed pickup or decent low priced car they would sell millions of them
So now, just like video games, they release a product that unfinished and expect you to just let them finish it later
It's an electric vehicle.  It can't be that good.
Thank you for featuring my car ❤
I can't wait for VinFast: Edgerunners to come out and endear it to the community again.
Vietnam can't made anything, this vehicle assembled in Singapore ,communist vietcong claimed made in Vietnam
I kind of get the feeling no American reviewer would give a car from Vietnam a good review
Sounds like a total POS especially at that price but I do like the idea of idiots who don't use turn signals not being able to turn 😁
Industry standards are a thing for a reason. Not having a star stop button is kinda dumb just do what everything else does there is 0 reason not to. I call that unintuitive and just being different for no good reason. HOWEVER lets all remember that cars in Vietnam are still pretty new, the motorcycle and scooter is king. So not a bad first attempt but yeah needs a ways to go.
That's what happens when you drive a car built in a Communist country
You made a big issue of of the lane keeping assist, but can't it be forcibly overriden in case of emergency? They way it seems to work now is what I have in other cars as well. And yes, you need to use the turn signal when changing lanes normally. Does it have automatic emergency braking as well? Automatic distance keeping on cruise control?
Oh golly gosh. One of my pet hates is intrusive nanny tech. This car would have me driving it into a wall just to shut it up. Spot on with your closing comment that an EV just has to be normal electric without being weird. On a brief test drive in a Tesla model 3, I got sick of the "indicator" engaging cruise control. Geez Louise! That's why I am a fan of Hyundai /Kia cars. They are EVs that don't need a day's lessons to learn how to drive them and if you swap between normal and. EV, there is not a major relearn every time. Bad enough when the indicator/ wiper washer are reversed on European derived cars.
I hope Natalie got this on a steal. Cause this car and brand is Garbage. Winfast needs alot more R&D and time before they can become a player.
A Vesla
Why would anyone buy this?  I don’t understand.
How you not gonna put Tesla as a competitor at the price range
Me: (Trying to change lanes to avoid a collision.) H.A.L.: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
if they won't let u change lanes without having your blinker than they are my HEROES!  the world would truly be a better place if every car did this haha  BUT because of danger issues maybe they should just electrically shock u via the steering wheel instead lmao.  u can turn in case of emergency, but u still get punished ;)
Continuity
You would have to be a fool to spend $50k on a new car from a new company.
That’s one ugly ass car . Let it fail
That is the ugliest shit I’ve ever seen
For the price of this car I would buy a mustang GT and have money left over
Maybe if it was 1/2 price
Don't think of it as a car, think of it as a product...  A product that a Conglomerate released too early and with too many bugs/glitches with every part built by the lowest Bidder leading to inconsistent build quality...   Whether it's computer games, Kitchen Appliances or, in this case, Cars... Massive Companies have been convinced that issues can be "Weeded out" by the early Buyers of their Products instead of developing a good starting product to begin with.
It doesn’t look like a 50k car
for 50k expect absolute PERFECTION. No bug fixing no bullshit. Perfection straight from the factory.
Yeah please test the updated car please ☺️
And the USA allow this car to be sold ?
just notice you guys didn't do the "rolling" as in the list there
the Yugo of the 21st century.
Rooting for the little guys even if their first attempt sucks.  Follow up after a year.  If they still exist.
Struggle to understand how EV companies can get always with untested tech...
Who would ever buy an experimental car let alone buy one from Vietnam
Good thing these bad reviews happen in  the US. If the bad reviews were in Việt Nam, Vinfast, “not so fast”will send the police to your house and put you in jail.
You think Vietnamese cars are bad…you outta try dating a Vietnamese woman…👸🏻 😂😂😂 Note…not from Vietnam, just Vietnamese-American from the San Gabriel Valley. BUY ME BUY ME BUY ME…TAKE ME SHOPPING!!!
$50,000? For what? So many better vehicles for much less.
I bought two same model year ev’s. Will not mention the name. One has lag time from the accelerator while the other is instant. Even the quality of leather is different.
From Vietnam to Chillingbourne.
I lived in Saigon for 6 years and recently left. I am shocked they are trying to sell in the USA. It is rare to see these cars on the streets of Saigon.
Why does it look like a e mustang
This is some flintstone cars…might as well pull your legs out and run with it
Still not as bad as a dodge
Serves you right for buying this turd when there are so many better options out there.
Is it a volkswagen?
i still think that startup is unnecessarily dumb
These are more disposable garbage that will be obsolete next year stop making this crap it doesn’t last and cost so much more money than buying used cars
and you thought things made in China was bad...
I've been to SE Asian and nobody uses turn signals.
The Communists never made a good car, this has not changed.
Have to say Cyberpunk 2077 had more developing time than this vehicle...Cyberpunk 1st announced in 2012. and takes 8 years for "completing". That's a $80 game. You lose $80 if it goes wrong in the worst senerio. This car company was established in 2018, and this car was released in 2022. it took 4 years from 0 to release from a brand new car company, and if it goes wrong on highway, you might not only lose $50,000 at all...
F1 style suspension?
How about you try reversing at more than .02mph
Bro you can literally buy a M340i for 50k
The start up is absolutely way better than Tesla.   Key in the middle? Really
Do a full line up and compare the different models to their top competitors.
Looks terrible. Those who bought them deserve it for being financially reckless
Sure, try it again, but I agree, use the same car & look at new reviews post repair/update
Vin fast 🫣
wait, whos in the back seat? LOL
I'm sure the car sucks, but it took you over a minute to find the center console start? Never drive a Saab.
that looks like a Renault in Europe...
I wasn’t expecting cyberpunk and no man’s sky to be mentioned in a Donut video hahaha
If vietnam was a car
Definitely do another review. You could focus on the items the manufacturer claims the software updated to see there is a different. This first review would be the baseline.
You must crawl before you walk, but Vinfast just want to “run” 😂
so i guess vinfast = 1/lucid
Makes you want to go buy an old 60's or 70's car.
Built by American MIA slaves from Vietnam war
The logo on the wheel looks identical with the logo of Callaway, that makea golf clubs. Callaway should sue.
Yo Nolan’s getting mad thicc
If they want to break into our market they need to improve the car and cut the price by $15,000.  The Chinese will eat their lunch when they start importing their branded cars.
a tesla model y is about the same price as a vinfast hunk of junk
Yugo vs vietnamese....yugo Wins perfect..
I’d like to see a update to see if they have gotten it better or not
I'm excited about the number of new electric car that comes out, as I'm getting sick of making parts for Tesla.
I only knew Vinfast existed because they sponsor Ironman.  I assumed it was Chinese.  The styling is decent, but clearly not ready for prime time.
Wouldn’t trust an eastern car that wasn’t made in Japan…
6:30 "This cars abusive!" 🤣🤣
Cyberpunk ever was garbage, electric cars are
No... A simple push to start. Or the SIMPLE KEY Turn!
If you spend $50k on this car, you have a learning disability. If it was $25k, I would understand. But you can get a model Y for around the same price and it would be 100x better in every measurable way. Along with several other cars from reputable, non-Vietnamese brand new companies wjth zero track record and little to no consumer support. Not sure how they sold a single one. Or even how USDOT allowed it in this country.
They put all these "features" in because they assumed the customer base would be asian, That being said it would fix the number of highway crashes if the customer base was asian but it isn't. (This comment is a joke)
They've rushed this to market.
I would have never spent $50000 on a vehicle called "vinfast". sounds like a gimmicky weight loss shake. for that kind of money i expect a better name and none of those communist like over controlling pussy ass safety features. plus the ride better be smooth as hell even over a speed bump. i suppose this is the future they want for us. that must be why this garbage came out during the plandemic.
That part of the 405 is awful. I used to daily a Panigale V4 to work in the area and that shit was like riding a pogo stick for a few miles.
Daaang! That’s pretty bad
VietNam did nothing on this car, just money .this is china car,most parts in the car from china.WORST CAR IN THE WORLD.
Don't buy the Chinese car. It's made 1000% in PRC
still has better build quality than a tesla
So you can’t steer around an obstacle in an emergency without first turning on the blinker…..sounds dangerous
If the car won't change lanes unless the blinker is on, that should be a fail for the blinkers. Too many situations require avoiding road hazards out of reflex that don't allow time for hitting the blinkers.
Don't chew gum while your filming, its very unprofessional and I can hear you chewing, which detracts from my enjoyment of your programme
That is not an SUV, thatbis a station wagon
Kính mong Các cơ quan chức năng vào cuộc kẻo hàng ngàn người sẽ chết oan vì loại ô tô hàng mã này của Vượng
Startup is no different than a Tesla, polestar, or Volvo.  Very intuitive. Open the door, sit down, and drive. Not hard.
这么烂的车，跟他比中国车就不是那么的烂。
I absolutely LOVE the mallet percussion piece playing in the background while they're trying to start up the car 🤣
I feel like the company is a fake April fool's day prank... But they're real... Crazy sh*t - lol
Imagine over the air updates that fixes the turn signals, but now the car recognizes bridges as off ramps.  Fix one issue and create three new ones.
Remember the Hyundai Excel?
I initially thought Vinfast was Chinese and was about to leave a troll comment. It's actually Vietnamese. Good luck my Viet friends, I wish you the best with this gig!
Vinfast is building a giant factory near my house in North Carolina. I have a feeling it’s going be a place for urban explorers In ten years.
I actually worked in the workshop of the business that developed the wiring harness for this car. I remember seeing the VF8 out for display one day because they were holding a meeting with executives later that night. Can’t believe this is how I’d be reminded this car exists.
ahhh, back to the days when hyundai came to N.A. remember the pony. albeit it was priced much more moderately, but, look where hyundai is today.
American homologation tests must be piece of cake
..I like the steering wheel.
want Chinese EV
What you expect from a car from Vietnam which is only known for Rice.
SO you could literally make money from owning this car re. special after sales policy...
Why did you not list the number one selling car in this category, Tesla model Y, as a competitor? Bias?
Vin fast is a scam junk
"not being a hypochondriac   not bolic
Good bye to the American market vinfast, not sure who was just as bad daewoo
If I'm going to spend $50K on a EV, not going to be this thing.
I won’t be buying any EV
$50k for a piece of junk 😮
I have no doubt that the Vietnamese will be tenacious in making improvements to sell a world class car.  If there is a comparison, I remember when Kias were considered a joke of a car not too long ago.  Now look at them.
foot on brake then putting it in gear is fairly standard EV procedure
Some of these issues are serious hazards. I really thought that cars would be safety-tested better than this.
Is that guy on day 780-something of asking for an Up To Speed on James’ dad?
Given the supply chain problems in Canada/USA, I doubt many people will buy such a vehicle.   Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Audi, Hyundai and Mercedes are well established car brands in North America. So they’ll keep their loyal customers. However, the need for spare parts will be troublesome for foreign competitors.
Communist building a great car? Nah
Do it, another shot. HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT!!! FIRE AWAAAAAY!!!!!!
Shouldn't blame the car for a slow start if the driver us so dumb!
Seat belts to crank the car? you not gonna bring up how unreliable sest sensors are?
Basically the same "start" as Tesla. Get it, put in D, and go, lol
I saw this vehicle at the Toronto international auto show in February 2023. Subsequently I went for a test drive and, I did not find any of the problems you are reporting on to exist. The acceleration has a small leg after you press the accelerator pedal - but that's it... I concur that the vehicle was probably brought to market about a year too early. I believe that however, if they can fix these small defects, they have a winning design. It is a tractive looking and seems to be ergonomically well put together. I sat in the vehicle. I believe I could do without the circus music in the background in places when you have your reviews. Not necessary. ...you know. Todo es una mierda...
The US market is the meat grinder of car startups. If you’re a startup you better have your shit together or you’ll get shredded.
How in God's name did this car make it to the US market? This should have _never_ been allowed on any US road. Speaking of "throwing money at problems", I imagine the manufacturer threw a lot of money at US politicians and their yes-men in the DOT.
The owner: “wtf guys?”
Lose faster
This car is made for vietnamese in vietnam not us Americans.
This car is like driving with the least overbearing asian parent in the passenger seat
Not since the Yugo has Americans been subjected to such a "fine" automobile :D lol
Def do a follow-up.
It shouldn't take years or millions of dollars to get a car to maket. There is enough information out there they should be able to build a car almost ready for market.   The problem is manufacturers  use us a bata testers and in this case it looks like they didn't even bother to test it first at all.
wonder how much bribe the makers had   to pay demos in order to okay the car for use
See what happens when it drives off a cliff!  lol
Vinfast is a very bad name for a car company.  It’s gonna mean vehicle identification number fast to any native English speaker. Sounds like a fly by night company getting you sketchy titles for old cars
I have the 2022 Kia k5 gt and it is this bad. I bought it new and from the very beginning it has sucked.
The driver in the purple shirt could almost pass as Matt from Matt's Off Road Recovery
i have a feeling that vinfast will disappear in US market in no more than 3 years
I want one
Why dont we allow cuba to sell cars here...lets get some more communist companies taking up precious american land.
50k to go 250 miles??
Electric junk clown cars.
Gimmicky bullshit. REAL engineers should be embarrased of this travesty of crap. Cornerstone of great engineering is simplicity. This is a bucket of failures waiting to happen.
vietnamese made scrap metal. i would rather walk
that start up procedure should not be a problem...when you buy one for sure they will teach you how to do it
Modem day Yugo 😂
In fairness, CP2077 on current gen hardware wasn't that bad when released.
Vietnam? Really? You want me to pay 50k for a car from a communist country with zero history of car production? Seriously?  Go stuff yourself.
Nice looking car
Yeah, I'm good.... Don't need to be beta testing some car for 50k 😂
You left off Tesla. I am done with you videos.
It really looks like a shitty copy of a Renault SUV.
I remembered similar complaints when Japanese cars were first introduced in America in the 70s, yet consumers were willing to buy because they were much cheaper and affordable.  For me to gamble on a car from an known company, it has to be a lot cheaper, like $20K.
Vinfast, we're quick to get you Vinfucked.
Henry looks like a Corn Movie director featuring Ron Jeremy 😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤
Bean-fast?  Sounds gassy.
Vinfart use Communist propaganda as Vinfast marketing strategy so that why their car suck
try the vf9.. i pre-ordered that a while ago..and think Im just going to wait for the hyundai ev9
I do love the interior though
Read the manual, dah.
I think the lack of lane change ability without signal, while we'll intentioned that it may be (I'm looking at you, BMW owners) is a SERIOUS liability while trying to avoid an accident or road debris.  Clearly counting on the driver's assist to save you is Russian Roulette at best
@donut WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COFFIN FLOP SWEATSHIRT? MUST HAVE! I cannot find it online 😭
Hey uh… just saying right out, I’d rather drive it than the mistake of the mustang Mach-e
😂😂😂😂😂You guys drive electric cars for $ 50,000, but I thought you were driving a high-end motor like a Messerdes s600. The old driver of the poor country has a different attitude . The billionaire businessman in the top of the world makes cars without a word of mouth, but only someone who really needs it and flows it in real life. The more you criticize it, the faster it grows faster than you think. Your head is not equal to the world's billionaire businessmen. For example, the Tessla electric car is even worse, not perfect, but it is a billionaire in the world. You should look at yourself, do not despise the new electric car company on the market, it tries to fix its shortcomings even though it is not good. You Youtubers have to have a little heart, don't look down on others too much. I love you guys
You don’t have regulators in the US who approve car releases?  That’s like having no FDA for food.
This car reminds me of the weird chinese pistols from the 1920s that were built by people who didn't know how to shoot. For instance, if it turns out the designer of the car doesn't drive normally; the myriad of warnings, the accelerator delay, the lane changes, even the startup proceedure all make sense.
funny thing about the laggy accelerator... I had a toyota that did that.  2008 camry.  Not always, but sometimes, the engine would take a full second (or more) to respond to a gas pedal input.  Annoying charms from my dad's Subaru, its EyeSight system was overly sensitive to lane markers or traffic.  Just saying, some of these problems even experienced manufacturers still have.  I'd give Vinfast a pat on the back for a decent effort for their very first try at making a vehicle, but I wouldn't buy one.
Is your video is sponsored by Tesla or another company ?.
United States
This is what happens when communists try to make cars instead of just assembling them for the people that design em.
You should try the worst car rated in mexico (chinese) your mind will explode LOL
The driving assist is scary.  Oh a child just ran into the road... too bad I forgot to turn my blinker on.
Just needs a firmware update and a reboot (Lol!)  Have you tried switching it off and back on again? (Double Lol!) Hey! At least you got to drive it. I remember the first reviews (?) of the Hyundai IONIC, where none of the reviewers got to drive it more than 50 ft (16 meters).
The approach of just getting in and the car is on is the best approach
I think it would be fair to do a followup video and do a back to back driving impression of a comparable vehicle to feel the true difference
NO ONE I am ever in the close to ever uses signals except the single finger salute as they exit right from the extreme  left lane
Ak bot verg god regui cser.
That start up appears to be a thief prevention. 8/10
It really has driver aids
Tesla's tech and software is way far superior like a galaxy away from this Vietcong pho EV.
I need one or two or three of those like YUGOs
Who is advising these new entries? Who out there is going to buy a brand new entry into the car market from a brand new company, let alone from a developing nation without any history of making awesome vehicles.  This cars entry level price shoulda been about $20k
This is especially funny if you consider what people were driving just 100yrs ago. "This horse farts too much." "The windows in this carriage could use glass."
50K for a vietnamese built car. LOL!!!!!!!
Yeah, try it again.  What the heck.
Wow, sounds like the "Yugo" of electric cars. OK, I'm old, and you young guys may have to look up "Yugo".😀
That policy of giving customers money for this or that problem does sound kind of nuts. But it is the kind of nuts that makes me want to like the company. Rolling out a car and thinking "we can fix it with updates" like a damned video game however, does NOT!
Started a new car company, could choose any kind of style, something different, nope, looks like everything else. Oh great, videogame problems has come to cars.
Any thoughts on the g56 car
What is this thing? looks like a Chinese POS bought from Alibaba. LOL, I'd be embarrassed to be seen in that "thing"
Maybe it is an artifact of the mixing from making the video, but I had to turn my subwoofer almost completely off because of the road noise in the video. It would have given me a headache if I hadn't.  caveat: Donut videos do seem to have excessively loud low end sounds compared to the rest of the range, so I am leaning towards that. But given that they were also getting a headache from the road noise...
Never even heard of this car company
It got quirks but unfortunately it was made by someone who doesn't know how to make a car.
The OG compliance Fiat 500e was one of the funnest cars I drove. Regular car, electric motor and instant torque. Funniest shit ever. I hope you boys find one.
Turn signals should NEVER be automatic, that needs to go. decent LOOKING car though
A little traction control is understandable, but why does anyone need lane assistance? note: keyword is NEED.  caveat: Screw traction control, give me control damnit!!! I know how to drive.
"Just make a car that's electric powered.  You don't make it all weird". Looking at Tesla first and foremost.
I don't care if you can download an update to fix the car.  The fact that vehicles could literally launch with a non working safety feature like faulty driving aids and that would just become even remotely acceptable is utterly horrendous.
Trust in the Donut.
Just another wake up call video that EVs are not the way to go. Sadly some keep defending them until they have their own personal wake up call.
I think you should give the owner of the car $103.30 because you feel sorry for her 3 times.
Rinse and repeat reviewing the No Mans Sky of cars
Test it again with the updates.
What I don’t get is why don’t these companies get people like donut to review their cars and see if it’s what the customers want. They hire all these rich car designers who have no idea what it’s like to ride in a lower end car and assume everyone will know how to use the extra stuff.
50k for a Vietnamese can? Holly fk
I would like to know what was the selling point convincing ppl to actually buy such unknown car.
2 days 1.7 viewers.That is interesting car
It’s inevitable Vinfast will sell in America.  After we fight a war with someone we start buying their cars.  Germany, Japan, Italy, Germany, Korea, England, and now VietNam.  Japanese and Korean cars all got ridiculed at first also.
Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t the start up sequence similar to newer Tesla models?
They should be sued for mass produce "lemon" cars. Hail those pioneering in testing this death trap.
Sure does act like a Chinese styled vehicle. You have to know China is investing in Vietnamese companies and probably controlling them . One strongly suspects that and I have no reason to believe other wise
“I have a headache” lol
You lost me the second you said EV, total pass. Plus it has a host of issues that could get you killed, BIG pass!
In the US where, Commifornia that loves EVs buy has no little charging stations for them? 😅😂😅😂😅😂
Southeast Asia traffic is absolutely insane by Western standards with mopeds filling every gap between cars. The chiming is probably warning you against creaming a motorcyclist in a turn.
Do Nolan and James like each other :(
The only car I want thats available in Vietnam but not in the US to be brought over is the Toyota Hilux. Bring it back please 🙏
A vomit Comit 🤢 and this is the first car people with eating disorders will love (this is a joke calm down karen)
Confirmed POS
Worst car I've ever driven: 2022 Mitsubishi Mirage. It shouldn't even be legal!
so the sunroof is good then ?
I feel like Vinfast has been played by the US government for political reason against China and changing the US EV market to make it extremely hard and expensive to sell a new foreign brand car in the US with strong regulation and expensive aftermarket customer service. Vinfast is just an example to show others.
Tại việt nam nếu chúng tôi chê xe vinfast thì họ có thể thuê cảnh sát bắt chúng tôi hoặc phạt tiền. Vin là một tập đoàn lừa đảo được bảo vệ bởi cộng sản việt nam, họ cấu kết với công ty trung quốc để lắp ráp xe với linh kiện rẻ tiền và kém chất lượng. Tại việt nam có rất nhiều vụ cháy của xe vinfast gây chết người và hầu hết đều bị che giấu...
lmao this car is actually driving aids
Good luck getting parts.
Vinhcrap. A  country that still can’t even make a reliable cellular phone or tv are making cars 😂
So proud of Vinfast, one of the worst car in EV industry.
YESSS!!! Finally, I have wanted too long for you guys to shred this company to pieces. Their shady business practices bring shame to our country. Edit: Don't get me wrong, I am proud to be a Vietnamese, I will always buy Vietnamese made products when I can and when it's reasonable to do so. I always buy Vietnamese made clothes and shoes when I can, because those are the best, I prefer Vietnamese made kitchenware and some electronics products. But this company, I despite this company.
Would still drive it before a Chevy Spark
Heck back in the late 50's Buick would use the gas pedal to start the engine, it would have a starter switch that would engage the starter when you full pressed the pedal to the floor
Who pay 50K for this garbage from unknown brand 😂
All EV's have lag in the accelerator in some degree..this car is NOT the worst :).  It does need adjusting but the point is even small EV's nowadays have more instant torque compared to a fossil regular new mustang and in FWD cars they WILL bloody torque steer like crazy and alot of people cannot handle that at all and drive into a ditch.  It is just a fact that ev's have instant torque compared to any fossil car that just pulls the shit outta ya and many drivers have no experience with super torque pull so the pedal has a delay so you dont run straight into mrs gobblebongs garden and kill her flowers.   ( like i said this car has ALOT of delay but it is usual)
Oh nooooo, kind of sad.  In Viet Nam they are so proud to make this thing, just visited there last year.  Its cool for Viet Nam to be making their own brand, 30 years ago Viet Nam was so ridiculously poor, its incredible how far the country has come to even get to this point.
1 second between flooring the pedal and something happening is actually dangerous as fuck because it makes the car unpredictable.
i vote redo. Why not. We can always use friendly competition. better from vietnam than ccp IMO.
RETEST IT WITH THE UPDATE PLEASE
admit it. You didn’t search this, it randomly popped in reccomended
A thought about the headaches you both experienced:  it's possible that there is a battery venting issue (which can definitely cause headaches...and worse).
maybe in twenty years, 50 grand will buy alot of gas
Dang I might own one of these just so I can get paid for minor inconveniences heck yes where do I sign up
I thought it was ethan from h3h3 on the thumbnail thats why i clicked but great video though i enjoyed it
@donut, regard to your complain about accelerator pedal. Vinfast car has a very interesting feature. If you jump or sudendly push on its accelerator pedal, the car will stop or reduce speed, instead of accelerate. The reason is that Vinfast car identifies you press the wrong pedal: you want to push the brake pedal but you push the accelerator pedal. It is one of safety feature of Vinfast cars.
Me: * buys a car made by Vinfast for $50k *  Car: * breaks down *  Me: "Hey Vinfast. The car you sold me broke down."  Vinfast: "I'm gonna pay you $100 to f*ck off."
I’m an American that lives in vietnam. They’re not that bad
Luckily for me, that car will never be on my radar to explore! Remember in the 1970's when things "Made in Japan" were the worst junk of the century? Well, it sounds like this EV won't last long in America!  Call VIN the "OceanGate of EV vehicles"!!!
Are you guys in Seattle? I had no idea. I would have brought by the insane field to road trip Fiero I did last year by on my way down the coast.
"Not an unnecessarily big pick-up truck. 0/10"
All in all. It’s a 💩 car. Just by a different electric vehicle, a proven  Tesla.
monkey discoveryng new world
Bring back up to speed. We need to start the movement!
Other than it's absolutely bad! I absolutely don't have the money to have that overprice junk.
Where do I get those model cars on the desk next to the donut logo???
Electric car... not interested.
theres no vehicle setup options? most cars have options you are able to select or unselelect to customize the vehicle to your liking. as far as switching lanes without the blinker, GM does this as well. its called lane keep assist. keeps you from drifting into the next lane if you are distracted.
Lets give it a fair shake, I definitely want to see a second video.
Charging 50,000 for a Vietnamese car is insane
Ill be staying analog with physical keys, gas engines and cables.  EVs will be the biggest failure in modern history.
Whistlin diesel where are youuuu
Funny how US would allow Vietnamese brand cars in the US before they allow Chinese brand cars. I would suggest to check on Shanghai auto show, their EV are gorgeous! Too bad I cant buy one over here....what a shame.
I like the way it looks, but that’s it I guess
They're called "turn signals."  Can we speak adult here?
Remember in the olden days when a company would ruin their reputation and be suited for false advertising when they released a broken product on the market and not get multiple years of grace to fix/patch the problems? Those were the days.
It’s not a bad car, the Americans are just expecting too much, i’ve seen some white guys tried to compare Vinfast with Tesla. I mean like come on! Vinfast only joined the EV industry not until 2021, only 2 years ago. I owning a Vinfast e34 which is their first electric car model (only available domestically in Vietnam) but I have no complaints driving it, during the first days, there were several errors but now they are all fixed and modified.
I'm actually impressed an Vietnam company brought a full car to market. For 50K no way in hell I would buy one but it is still impressive.
I'll just stick with a Toyota instead. I'm not jumping on the EV bandwagon anytime soon. More needs to be done. They aren't developed enough yet, we don't have the charging and electrical infrastructure yet, they cost too much, and it really isn't helping all the much when it comes to pollution. It's all a big lie. Most of the electricity comes from burning coal and fossil fuels, and the mining of materials for the batteries as well as the process of building them, really isn't helping to become Eco friendly. You're just replacing a tailpipe with bulldozers and the smoke stack of a power plant.
I wanna know what crack Pham Nhat Vuong is smoking to charge $50K for that thing.
cyberpunk was fine at launch as long as you aren't a console barbarian
"Blinkers"  Let's become adults and call them turn signals.
EV is for losers. Total bs
Hopefully, for Vin"fast", they won't be known as "Vinslow".
be careful, if you gave them a bad review, they will ask the Vietnamese police come to kidnap and arrest you to shut you up.  At least, that is what they have done to the reviewers in Vietnam.
It’s a new car
50k usd for this? I can buy XPeng SUV for less money, which is excellent car
It’s not an easy thing to build a car, especially if a company lacks experiences  Relying on smart engineers hoping them to develop crazy things by themselves like Tesla, or starting from basic economic cars for gradual level up as like Toyota and Hyundai did during the engine days  Those seem to be a right process to start EV business, but VF is neither of them  Needless to say it’s even worse than Chinese cars
This VFast car is worse  then the Yogo car a long time ago. You need 4 people one to drive, 3 push. This car has all different manufactures: Electric motors by Chinese com. battery by LG. Frame by Europe, labor by Vietnamese. If something goes wrong ( all) you can't fix it. South VN has made car in the 60s called La Dalat. It is like the french Pueget. It lasted until 1975. Its was ahead of Kia and Huyanday. Even it can compare to Hondas 300s back then. I hope you will not take a money from them to give them positive review. VFast has tried to pride many jounolists before to give positive ratings for its poor design cars. The Chinese cars are way better and cheaper than VFast. But the best one is Teslas.
This is just classic trash the new guy and fear of competition. No doubt the brand has it's issues - IT JUST STARTED. Show me a damn car company that was flawless since day one(ok.. besides Koenigsegg)
if it aint a nolan and james video i aint watching
Is it truthful ? I don't think you are serious. Many people will recognize this. Wait for the future
the article at the end On average the ENTIRE process takes 72 months. ummm thats only 3 years so if vinfast started the process in 2017 and released the car in 2020 then that is 3 years. Learn maths guys
why is Donut using videogame analogies? are the ven circles so close than the intersection is huge?
Shout out to No Man’s Sky
vin phét in the cức
Drive it off the Santa Monica Pier 😂
Who would buy an untested car from Vietnam for that much money?
I wish we knew the sun roof issue 😢
A lot of Vietnamese losers who didn't contribute anything to the country's progress, are trying their best to smear and bring down the automaker. Of course it's new and has many problems, but I believe they will be successful 'cause anyway their sales are good enough to survive.
If you are in Vietnam you will be sued by Vinfast and may go to jail 😂 (Nếu ở Việt Nam b sẽ bị Vinfast kiện và có thể đi tù)
You can't swerve unless your blinker is on?! I have no idea how many times I've had to dodge things in the greater Boston area, from trash bins flying off a truck to a sudden mattress on a curve, and of course people who have no idea what "yield" means.   That's a BIG no.
Your channel have us some terrible Forza content cars review is probably only as bad as you channel
So is it Chinese junk funded by the CCP? 🤔
vinfast..  vin diesel and fast furious??
In Vietnam, Vinfast even sued and threatened to put a buyer into prison for expressing his Vinfast car's errors and failures. Vinfast can also call the police to arrest or summon anyone telling something bad about their trash cars.
😂😂😂
don't start buying early acces cars xD NONONONONO this WILL end up more fucked up than ever xD
Someone got paid off at the end.
I’m from vietnam but Vinfast in here it to good
New Vinfast dlc coming soon.
Ah a product v1. There is a reason why most products we buy are not version 1. But 1.12 or so.
What an ass car. Pathetic.
Let's see a follow-up video to see if some of the issues have been fixed. No car can be this bad.
A bull. My grandfather don't like iphone and she tell me that iphone is Faulty product. :))
your worst car is someone's dream car
Looks like Vinfast's anti theft tactics are working to perfection hahahahaaa
Flagship is VF9 .
1: R T F M
VinFast is the car manufacturing arm of VinGroup, a massive Vietnamese conglomerate that's involved in everything from real estate to tech to education. Like its parent company, VinFast has grown at an eye-searing rate. VinGroup was founded in 1993, and VinFast itself was only started in 2017. Just a few years later, it's delivering cars to customers in both Vietnam and North America. The VF 8, like all VinFast models headed to America, is all-electric.
This car is a joke . As a Vietnamese, I’m embarrassed. This car worth less than $10k
Glad to see NON CHINESE MADE !! Finally , thx Vietnam,  I'm sick of everything made in China.
Too bad.  I had high hopes for VinFast.
this car absolutely garbage
The name Vinfast sounds like a Vietnamese dietary supplement for weight loss.
The funny yet sad thing is that most of the country will not understand just how bad California roads are.
i would not buy a car from a country where the people were living in rice paddies not so long ago. and how does a communist have 4 billion dollars?
sunroof or driver aids....why does it keep changing!
Crazy how they'll charge 50k for a suv that probably took half of it to make.
So in other words, you're spending 50k to beta test a car that could potentially brink  on the freeway 😳
Do it again
All they have to do is market the startup procedure as an antitheft measure, although the crappy reviews do plenty enough.
Gotta give props for them taking accountability and offering to not only fix the problems but also compensate for them. Usually you need to take legal action to get a single dime from from these greedy companies.
A car from a company with 6 years of experience, I bet that will last 200K miles easy LMFAO!  Yet fools and their money will part, and keep on parting to keep the POS on the road.
If anybody has this guy and he doesn't like it then send it to me 😐😐😐😐
Waiting for Interpol to take down this video 😂😂😂
I'd like to see how it does with the update.
" It's like a bad room mate "....
I think the "at the fouth day you get 100$ per day in service" part is meant to be on top of the second type with 300$ compensation. So you need repair so you get 300$ but it takes more so you get 100$ per day extra so you actually get 100$ per day that it is in service. Still fucking ridiculous but if that is the way they do this it looks "reasonable" (for how strange the compenstion is).
Its kaar not khaar
Appreciate Tesla even more now!
Don't beleive anyone unless you have tried it by yourself .... Sometimes these critics and reviewers are paid to vomit lies against better rivals.... The world is owned by fakesters
I drove a Golf GTE, the software drove me mad. Full of bugs and knowing better, like driving with you mom
Imagine paying 50k to alpha test a rich Vietnamese guy's new electric toy.
What a trash car lmao
In most electric cars If you spam the gas pedal like you did nothing will happen. It's for safety purposes
Try it again!
The front reminds me of a Renault Megane.
Vinfast emailed donut and said okay how much money to redo this and claim the issues are fixed...lol.....corporate world!
I gotta say despite the reviews this company shows promise.  Vinfast jumped the release too early and tarnished their name. They'd better fix these issues quickly before most Americans learn the name Vinfast, or they'll earn a reputation for unreliability. Still this company is a diamond in the rough. Think about it: in this short time they've come to market with a product that's pretty impressive and looks great. Americans are super demanding for what they get for their money though, these reliability issues cannot continue they need to release a FINISHED product, not a beta test.
this is why i am losing faith in car industry.... tha last good cars were made in late 90's that actually still was cars... now they are something else (worse)
"imagine you went to switch lanes and didn't have blinkers on"?? I mean, who switches lanes without indicating??
The fact they they are offering cash for anything is actually pretty cool. I don't imagine other car company's are giving cash back for their shitty cars
Big yikes
50k for a new unproven car company?? I will possibly consider buying this if they offer it for 15k. No more than that.
You guys are awesome, well reviewed and honest.
It is not a bad looking car. I just think it needed more testing before it was released to market.
lol the type 3 issues they'll charge you hundreds or thousands to fix it but they'll toss you some jury duty money
James isn’t as funny that he is slimmer
try the signals in a curve
looks like Changli is far more reliable and perform way better than this crap
Who saw that wolf grey K5 tho 👀
Funny thing is that car brand hated korean cars sooooo much saying "oh you are just hyundai" "oh we will beat you in many other way like design and quality" and bla bla bla As korean i took that insilt personally and its kinda funny to see the reality hit different from what they claimed but every car brand starts somewhere and i believe as time goes that that car brand might get good
we're firmly into idiocracy time line here
Imagine taking this to the driveins but in order to keep the car on you have to wear a seatbelt for the entire movie
Blind spot monitoring being unreliable would be an instant deal breaker for me. I rely on it too much
Maybe having you say, what I've been saying right along will help, just build a darn car. EVs have too many bells & whistles, clearly no one considers that you could get more range if you didn't add so many power sucking features.  That being said, I wish Vinfast well. One little thing I notice about the car, the front end doesn't look like they took an ICE car a stuck a blank where the grill goes. I don't have a problem with a car shaped car.  BTW, you didn't touch on regenerative braking. Do it? If so, how well?
Yeah, I’m going to stick to my ancient dinosaur-juice powered Alfa - more reliable.
How did a car this bad ever make it to the market?
A car that stops you from changing lane just because you dont have your blinkers on sounds dangerous for people who practice defensive driving.  If an accident suddenly happens in front of you, you won't be able to change lane to avoid it immediately at once unless you put on blinkers first.
my country Vietnam cannot produce even a scews 😅 what would you expect from this useless vehicle
Another test needed. Trust but verify.
Review So stupid😂
"Volkswagon ID.4" lol
Tom Peng buy 5 car Vinfast, all series of Vinfast, and he love it.
Knowing that i couldnt know anymore about cars than you boys had me wishing for 4 barrles and positrack rear ends,still...(im as old as James tho..js)
The fact they (the overly patriotic vietnamese) keep bragging they can build a car (an electric to boot) doesn't mean a thing in one of the biggest and oldest car industry in the world  Even my own country have a hard time with our own car manufacturer making sub par vehicle
Todd Howard once said It all just works! gee thanks Todd Howard!
Keep Vietnamese cars in Vietnam
“Slightly different start up procedure” bruh come on
car needs a day 1 patch smh
Do it again. Love to see if they’ve fixed it❤
If they will provide it, do it again. I am surprised the Gov. let the car on the road. Had a ford rental that slowed down for shadows from the overpasses on the turnpike. 🤣🤣🤣
I wouldn`t touch a Kia, ask me about the Vinblast.
Don buy Chinese cars, motorcycles etc…  Hope Americans have a little sense of pride and not buy them Chinese junk. Seriously. Them chinese do that, why cant we. It all starts with you.
Just nitpicking on the newcomer.
mr.Vuong needs to be humbled
10:48 you know when you're clicking an unresponsive desktop program icon and then suddenly 30 windows open?
Whyis this so surprising, it's their fiest car, they could just copy, but then nonone would want it over the copied. BMW, Polestar, Ford had furst release issuse. I feel the country of origin is lending to the bias . The car is not unsafe, however i agree they could have had a special first owner program to wotk out real world new car issues.  Lesson to be learned here.
All electric cars are garbage
what a crappy car
$50,000 dollars? It’s quite close to the premium range. What makes them think they can compete with other well-established car companies. As a new player in the market, they don’t have the same level of reputation as the old and famous brands. To win over customers, the most effective approach would be to offer similar specifications at a more affordable price. Take Hyundai and Kia, for example, who successfully captured a share of the market by selling their cars at a lower prices compared to Japanese and other competitors. Over time, their brand reputation grew and people began to trust and choose them. Alternatively, having a visionary founder like Elon Musk, with his exceptional business and marketing abilities, can attract talented individuals to join the company and drive its success on a global scale. Vinfast’s strategy is just confusing.
I never noticed before how much Nolan’s voice sounds like Chris Pratt.
I don’t understand people defending cars like this just because problems can be fixed with OTA updates. This is a car you drive on the highway at highway speeds. People can die. Small distractions kill people on the road all the time. Your customers shouldn’t be a product tester, period.
A TRASH REVIEW
Vinfake ..
It's always a little strange hearing about millionaires in 'communist' countries.
Lol what kind of dickhead is buying a vinfast instead of an Ioniq 5...
The lane assist not letting you change lanes if your blinker isn't on isn't just a Vinfast problem. My wife's 2020 Ford Escape will be super aggressive about that and will sometimes chime as well.
Give them another try to see if it's better
They want to sell it super expensive here in Europe
You looking good James keep up the good work bud
Just to say. I would never risk my life, my family life to drive a car from a very very new car brand , made from a country without manufacturing experience and no history of making car ,even is given for free as a toy , I wouldn’t take it as I have no place to display it. Whoever willing to take this risk, please welcome to buy
At 2:07 the board shows Sunroof. Then it changes to drive aids.  What about the sunroof?!! I have to know! If the sunroof is that good, I can overlook all the other shitty issues.
6:14 nhìn thật giả tạo hãy cho tôi xem chuyện gì đã xẩy ra
Gotta download the dlc for performance options
rõ ràng 2 gã này đang dìm hàng vinfast. đánh giá không trung thực
All these stupid EV's and your obvious CA insulation to the real world is why I unsubbed.
I gotta be honest, this car is boring and trash at the same time, not a good combo.
FYI Vinfast didn't start from new. They used to sell the GM Vauxhall Viva/Opel Karl/Chevy Spark as the Vinfast Fadil, plus other cars rebranded vehicles as Vinfast in Vietnam.
if you are in Vietnam you will be sued and possibly go to jail (nếu bạn ở Việt Nam bạn sẽ bị kiện và có thể đi tù) 😂😂
JDM are still the best, they made u be a real driver.
Look! The Vietnamese making Americans confused again!
100% do a follow up!
50k$ for a foreign OEM of a yet unknown reputation, that looks like every other compact SUV or whatever bs term this is, already on the road ? Thats bold.
Vinfast has a lot of reviewers (around 10000 ppl) on the Internet, and if you live in VietNam they will call up to Police to take you to jail, they don't care what you review.
If this car doesn't turn if no blinkers on, then it is a public safety hazard. this shouldn't be on public roads.
I don't know Why people keep criticising new cars or new products. Why don't you try to make your own brand cars or new products. Sell them. Then you will understand. -Chairman of vinfast is JUST an ordinary man. -Can you guys make you own Brand car of Billion dollars???
Still better than esemka
The most developed country in the world, the United States, the United States automobile industry is so developed, the United States even need to import cars from Vietnam, a country with little automobile industry, the Americans are too idiotic, the Americans are so stupid need to buy Vietnamese cars?😏😏😏
To be fair, Cyberpunk 2077 was rubbish only on og old consoles. New ones and PC ran pretty smooth, with some bugs but nothing catastrophic
Well I have not seen much shocking things compared to, let's say, a Hyundai Ionic hybrid. That car will also overload you with warnings and annoying sounds. Drive assist...I wonder what idiot thought it would be a good idea to already  use a technology that isn't mature. No carmaker has a decent system, not even Tesla that brags about it. And that for the sake of so called safety (because we humans are a danger and that is true but...) these systems tend to make things even worse. Instead of applying tech to serve a drive it's just adding tech gimmicks for the sake of being able to brag about having the most. Just give me an old school car with just the amount of tech that matters such as basic active security, best possible engine (and consumption) management, focus on the least possible weight (as consuming as less as possible is still far more ecological regardless of the type of energy used) and keep the rest "old school" analogue, especially for the basic controls like climate control, radio (and please no huge multimedia slabs that just are even more dangerous because of the attention grabbing nature of it). You still just drive a car, not a home cinema on wheels. Last but not least, it seems that people (especially so called car reviewers) have forgotten to "READ THE FUCKING MANUAL" thing. It helps...
Me wondering why people say the car weird: guess I gotta find out then
Oooo coming from a person with a car with a ridiculously small engine, please take this car up and down steep incline roads. With the acceleration and the way the car bounces I can see some highways/backroads being really hellish. I'm in particular wondering if this car would kill you on the grape vine.
what about sunroof?
The worst part is when they compare a car to games.   People do not sit in a game.
I’ve watched you guys for a bit now and it feels like you running out of content
Hmm.. yes... There are German cars, Japanese cars, American cars... no, I will buy an even more expensive Vietnamese car I've never heard of.
GR86 hi and low????
Tại sao Vinfast không bán  được xe ở Mỹ : 1. Xe Vinfast là một hãng xe mới chưa có danh tiếng gì hết vô thị trường Mỹ nên khách hàng ngại mua. 2. Xe Vinfast đến từ Việt Nam,  một quốc gia vẫn bị coi thường là chậm tiến chưa có kỷ nghệ nặng xứng tầm quốc tế.  3. Việt nam chưa từng có truyền thống sản xuất xe hơi.  Trước 75 ở Miền Nam có sản xuất xe La  Dalat nhưng chỉ dùng nội địa không có xuất cảng.  4. Xe Vinfast bị cho là nhập cảng phụ tùng từ Tàu (nhiều nhứt) và các nước khác về lắp ráp thành chiếc xe. 5. Xe Vinfast phẩm chất quá kém bị 14 tạp chí Mỹ chuyên về xe hơi đánh hội đồng,  chê tơi tả, chê thậm tệ,  chê không còn chỗ nào để chê nữa,  chê hết mức.  Có tạp chí còn viết đây là chiếc xe dở nhứt trong lịch sử review xe của họ.  6. Ngoài ra tạp chí nổi tiếng Jalopnik còn đưa ra 12 mẫu xe điện và 2 mẫu xe xăng rồi kêu gọi người Mỹ hãy mua một trong 14 chiếc xe nầy và đừng bao giờ mua Vinfast Vf8. 7. Người Mỹ rất tin tưởng vào các tạp chí review xe hơi nầy vì là những tạp chí rất có uy tín từ xưa tới nay. 8. Lúc đầu Vinfast chỉ cho mướn mà không có bán.  Sau nầy có bán mà hình như ( hình như thôi không chắc chắn- sẽ bổ túc và đính chính nếu sai lầm- xin cáo lỗi trước) ngân hàng Mỹ không cho mượn tiền mua xe Vinfast,  nếu muốn mua phải trả tiền mặt mà người Mỹ đại đa số mua xe trả góp. Bởi vậy mua xe ở Mỹ rất dễ chỉ cần tín dụng tốt mua chiếc xe 50 ngàn chỉ cần trả trước 5,3 ngàn phần còn lại vay ngân hàng và trả vài trăm dollars một tháng trong vòng 3 tới 6 năm.  9. Xe Vinfast VF8 giá bán quá mắc so với phẩm chất của xe.  Một số tạp chí nói Vf8 chỉ đáng giá 2, 3 chục ngàn đô la thôi mặc dầu Vinfast Vf8 là loại Suv ( hay crossover) nhìn khá là bề thế.  10. Vinfast là hãng xe mới qua Mỹ chỉ có showroom bán xe mà không có nơi bảo hành sửa chửa.  Nếu hư thì sửa ở đâu và phải chờ phụ tùng thay thế đưa qua từ Việt Nam nên rất mất thời gian. Nước Mỹ lớn gấp 30 lần Việt nam nên rất bất tiện nếu sử dụng xe Vinfast.  11. Theo một youtuber được Vinfast cho một chiếc chạy miển phí để quảng cáo thì Vinfast chỉ sạc được giới hạn ở một số trạm sạc chớ không phải có thể sạc bất cứ trạm sạc nào ở Mỹ.  Bởi vậy rất bất tiện.  12. Xe Vinfast bị coi là không an toàn do đợt triệu hồi (recall) do hư màn hình. Thật ra vấn đề xe bị recall là chuyên rất bình thường ở Mỹ và trên thế giới.  Nhưng Vinfast là hãng xe mới nhập vào bán ở Mỹ,  chưa bán được chiếc nào mà đã bị recall, nên cộng đồng xe hơi ở Mỹ và khắp thế giới đưa nhau bốc mẻ, đè bỉu, cười nhạo. Có người cho đây là hư nhẹ do phần mềm.  Có người cho là hư nặng và đi xe Vinfast rất nguy hiểm vì Vinfast thiết kế theo kiểu mới không có phần đồng hồ trước bánh lái kiểu truyền thống mà tập trung hết tất cả chức năng vô màn hình,  khi màn hình bị tắt tài xế coi như bị mù lái xe mà không biết gì về tình trạng của chiếc xe. 13. Người Mỹ quay lưng không mua Vinfast đã đành mà người Mỹ gốc Việt cũng tẩy chay xe Vinfast luôn. Lý do: Người Việt ở Mỹ và con cháu họ đại đa số là người quốc gia thuộc chế độ Việt Nam Cộng Hòa nên họ ghét Cộng sản, xe Vinfast bị coi là xe của Cộng sản nên họ tẩy chay.  Bởi vậy có người không hiểu nên thắc mắc  rằng khi Nhựt, Đại Hàn đưa xe qua Mỹ thì được cộng đồng người Mỹ gốc Nhựt gốc Đại Hàn ủng hộ, nhưng khi Vinfast đưa xe qua thì bị tẩy chay vì cộng đồng Việt tại Mỹ là cộng đồng chống cộng,  Vinfast theo họ là xe của " tụi Việt cộng ". Bởi vậy họ kịch liệt tẩy chay. Ngoài ra những fan cuồng của Vinfast gọi là Vin nô khi thấy người Việt không mua xe Vinfast thì chửi Ngụy Nô, 3///,Đu Càng, Tộc Nail.... làm họ càng ghét và càng lánh xa Vinfast coi như đồ cùi đồ hủi.  14. Thật ra những người Việt quốc gia ở Mỹ là khách hàng tiềm năng đầu tiên của Vinfast  vì họ đại đã số khá giả nhà nhà có 3,4 chiếc xe hơi đời mới là chuyện bình thường,  và tiền bạc thì đầy ngân hàng.  Nếu có dịp tới Little Saigon,  dạo phố Bolsa sẽ thấy người Việt lái xe mắc tiền chạy khắp phố Bolsa. Cho nên Vin nô vô cùng dại dột khi bôi bác họ.  Họ đã ghét xe Vinfast sẵn rồi bây giờ còn đổ dầu vô lửa cho họ ghét thêm.  15. Vinfast cho tới hiện nay vẫn chưa bán được chiếc xe nào ở Mỹ. Chỉ có 111 chiếc cho mướn và cho youtuber chạy miển phí để quảng cáo mà thôi.  16. Tương lai xe Vinfast ở Mỹ như thế nào thì không dám tiên đoán trước.  Nhưng Vinfast lỗ 598 triệu USD trong quí 1/2023, và hiện đang cố gắng lên thị trường chứng khoán Mỹ với số vốn ước tính là 23 tỷ USD không biết có được chấp nhận hay không vì định giá 23 tỷ e rằng hơi cao. Muốn bán xe bất cứ ở đâu cần những điều như sau:  A. Xe giá rẻ: xe Vinfast quá mắc tiền đặc biệt Vf9 giá dự kiến 83 ngàn USD.  B. Xe phải phẩm chất tốt  an toàn: xe Vinfast hư tứ tung. C. Hậu mãi tốt  bảo trì sửa chửa. Vinfast bảo hành xe 10 năm và 120000 miles là rất tốt nhưng trạm bảo hành không có hư thì sửa ở đâu.  D. Xe điện đang bị cạnh tranh dử dội,  ngoài Tesla ra , các hãng xe xăng truyền thống cũng làm xe điện.  Vinfast mạo hiểm khi đưa xe qua Mỹ.  Vì đưa xe qua Mỹ là một chuyện mà có bán được hay không lại là chuyện khác. Nên nhớ chuyện sau quan trọng ngàn lần hơn chuyện trước .
I’m American live in China But this car built by Chinese company it’s called  (BYD) build your dream
the car the go fast kid is forced to drive, too much NFS games... gas = does nothing.
Vinfast is a scam electric  car company , it’s main goal is to get in to USA IPO to collect money from share holders to fun its nearly bankrupt company,not to sell the car, that why they rushed into producing cars which  all spare parts  have been imported from other countries, mainly from China, how could  a non industrialized country without manufacturing experience like VN produce an electric cars in such an extremely short time, Vinfast thinks it can fool and control the world like they used to fool and control Vietnamese citizens. In Vietnam, every negative review about Vinfast will be banned or  they even threaten the complainer . Everyone with sense should know  this.
As soon as James said this is one of the worst parts of the freeway I already knew exactly where they were, made that drive every month for the last 8 years
they released the car too early not for users, just for IPO  🤣
Have any of you guys tried going to different countries and trying out the cars you guys *WILL NEVER* get there in America?  And honestly though regarding the new Asian cars, I'd actually prefer the Chinese ones over Vinfast. I love Vietnam but I highly doubt their car manufacturing capabilities. Plus Chinese EVs are some of the best EVs out there.
Cho hỏi có con bò hay em Vin nô nào ở đây không??? 😂😂😂😂
The start sequence is the same as a Tesla so no issue there. That suspension though… no software update is going to fix that..
Whoever wants to commit suicide, just buy Vinfast!
Buy1 vinfast,they  offers 4 coffins !!ha ha
What an interesting car first car from Veitnam they gave it a shot and sort of failed l would like to see a follow up test l agree with you build a car thst just works there are plenty of EVs that work like a car and whats wrong with a stalk for the blinkers they had them 60 years ago and they work perfectly fine why complicate duch s simple idea
Bọn" VIN NÔ"có ngon thì vào đây mà phản biện😂
It suck because it is made for vietnamese, i know because i’m vietnamese
why would anyone buy a communist car
DOA
Thank You ❤❤❤   We hate Vinfast China...  Made in china
What do you expect from a third world country?
Đó là Xe Tầu dán nhãn VN - Bê bíp nhân dân
German or Japanese
Sounds just like our golf 8 and our first gen model 3, after the whole stupid LIDAR affair... 🙄 Continued breaking or malfunctioning of the elektronics and "assists". 😖
Ở việt nam họ mua vì lòng yêu nước là nhiều, còn thực sự nó tệ thì ở việt nam không dám nói vì sợ , không trải nghiệm không dám chê.
I think it’s crazy how long I-405 is. I live in Washington State and 405 is up here
It is very very strange but I read a lot of positive review from American press about the VF8 for example The Engaget The Detroit bureau JD Power. These Channel have also million of subscribers. I have a doubt concerning the sincerity of this post.   Give me your thought.
The anti-BMW driver
this shit aint games though, especially if you need to commute daily. It's just wrong to sell a car for 50k and then use your customer for "beta" testing w/ 0 warning sign.
Vinfast is paying $5000 and a "press car"  for each decoy duck youtuber in California.
Basically all funded by American car makers to kill competition they doing this from a long time in other sectors like defence industries, pharmaceuticals industry
DONUT PLEASE - you gotta understand what this company is. Look at the native vietnamese comments - they are terrified of this company. My ex worked for their group as a teacher. Their automotive branch wasn't performing to target so staff were forced to buy their shitty scooters. FORCED. Threatened with firing, removal of pay, bonuses, and LOCKED OUT of the gated community her workplace was in until she bought one. We fought so hard but in the end we just bought one. The chargers break and they gaslight customers like fuck, refuse to replace or repair and offer no options for you to source a new one. They just hire companies like paninfarina, bosch, and so on, throswing money at it with zero passion for automobiles themselves. One reviewer left a negative review on his video and it all mysteriously disappeared - they went after him HARD, look how terrified the local vietnamese are to talk against it... PLEASE upvote so donut see this.
This video is sponsored by Tesla ?.
Making a new car company and car is very hard, who knew? Vinfast ain't Tucker that's for sure.
🤡🤡
VinFast = *VinFart* Folks, just to let you in on a sentiment shared among freedom-seeking non-Commie Vietnamese communities in the US.
Welcome to jail. Have a happy life
absolutely trash car
A prime example of rushing an obviously flawed product onto the market, without enough development/testing time. How can a company sell you something, and then say after less than a week and if the car starts to fail, we will give you money. You would have absolutely no faith in that car from day one. Not the most profitable business model, eh?
Great review, This vinfast car is stolen from China, it is China car under Communism Viet + company!
Love how car makers keep adding software features and forgetting to fix the bugs that comes with it. Just imagine you're driving and the vehicle suddenly applying hotfixes and accidentally messing your car up because the hotfix brings up another bug. We need buttons and knobs, not a massive screen full of bugs.
part way through sunroof rating changed to drive aid
I just got a Chevy Bolt and love it because it's a fucking car. It just works like a car with nice features and happens to be electric. It doesn't have Bluetooth enabled door handles that sometimes won't let you in like a Tesla and that are entirely unintuitive for first time users, for example. There's a broad trend of all kinds of companies releasing products WAY TOO EARLY, and being like, "oh, we'll fix it in software releases later." It needs to stop. Make a complete god damn product. We don't need yearly roll outs of the latest and greatest, we need shit that works when you buy it. Also stop the subscription bullshit. I would have bought Super Cruise, but Chevy made it subscription after 3 years, so fuck that. I want to own the thing I pay nearly $40k for.
Why was James on 2 broke girls?
If you like excessive chimes and terrible body control you'll love the Subaru Ascent.
I would LOVE to see a "Bare Bones" electric car "That Just Works". Bare minimum legal "nanny tech", a regular old car key with lock and unlock buttons, have physical control buttons, NO TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM CONTROL, and a fast charge battery that can do at least 350 miles before getting to 20% and needing a charge.
For $50,000, you can buy 50 P.O.S. cars that will be more enjoyable than THAT 1 P.O.S. car😅
This review is worse than the car.
They've just stepped into the industry. Maybe there are potentials. Let's see
Basically today's Yugo.  That bad.  Really.  Lol.
Dear Mr doughnut media guys, can you do a video on the many ways of removing a stuck oil filter from a car with out the proper tools vs the correct tools and use the cartridge style filter as a curve ball
For 10k i would happily be a beta tester. For 50k? F NO!
These Vinfuk cars are Chinese made being sold as a Vietnamese product...
I am a citizen of Vietnam, Thank you very much for your reviews, thanks to your video, it has helped many people know about VF8 or Vinfast from our country. If smart customers really care about cars, they should go to the stores to drive and experience it, not just listen but act. Best regards
seems like a big commercial for the car company
Definitely a VinFast is way better than a Chinese car. Guaran-fu**in-teed. Greetings.
As a Tesla owner I came across all these issues starting to drive an ev. HOWEVER all these issues were fixed by switching basically all settings. You guys not might want all the rings and alrerts but the 70 year old grandma does. In Tesla you can adjust the distance from where a car beeps so if you like getting close you can choose to make it alert you super close.
Am I the only person here who is a car guy but never heard of this brand name until this video??!! 🤔🤯🤨
Finally!!! Yugo is not the worst car any more! ;)
The comment section is like the Vietnamese don’t have any good car channel to argue on 😂  Anyways, a little mix up but type 3 does give $300 from type 2 + $100/day after 3 days.   That’s like a four-way uber, wish I’d be getting that with my GLC.
id love to see a follow up
I have a doubt concerning the sincerity of this review.  I drive a Vinfast VF8 and find that it is very safe. So strange to read these comment from this youtuber.
@13:13
Just buy a Tesla ffs
Lolbot-5000
The fish eye lense sucks
Get one in 3 months and another in 6 and see how it progresses if at all
KIA SELTOS GTLINE IS ANOTHER SHIT BOX
Communist LADA of 21st century
I say give them another chance they obviously seem to care and want to improve
People in Vietnam are scared to write bad reviews for Vinfast's cars because of the evil billionaire behind the company. Thanks for your honest review
Give them a fair shot. Competition is good. The price isn't competitive though when you consider what you could be driving for 50 grand. js.
In Vietnam, anyone who complains about Vinfast's car quality will be invited to work by the police, and will be called to work by the police, even threatened with jail
well that blinker problem is gonna exclude all bmw drivers to consider this car
Fùck VinFast. Fúck EVs. Internal Combustion will never die🤷🏽‍♂️maybe hydrogen powered cars but there’s plenty of problems with those too.
In Vietnam Vinfast makes use of "patriotism"  to  sell and market their cars. Ironically, there is not a single Vietnamese thing in these cars, they imported parts from China and assemble them in Vietnam, I think they even import whole cars from China.
Do the update video!!!
Ho gag.  Another battery powered car.  Do these people understand how many overpriced, overweight electric cars are sitting - unsold - on dealers' lots?  People aren't buying them, that is, except for the ones who have bamboozled into virtue signaling.
IF ANY EV DIDN'T SELL WELL(at least 3000 per month) IN CHINA, OR EVEN NOT SELLING IN CHINA,THEN IT'S TRASH.
Lets see round 2. Maybe the sequel will be better. Cant be any worse. Hopefully
I mean, in fairness to the start up sequence and not being able to change lanes without your blinkers - isn't that what we all want?? Lol how many people complain about no blinkers? I would love a car that forced that on everybody!! And dear God, make sure your door is closed and your seatbelt is on or I won't start up. As annoying as that could be if you just plan on cruising a parking lot or something, it's a safety feature that's kind of neat. I know people will hate it because it's trying to tell them what to do but like, hey.
Is there a way to turn off the chimes? Most cars gave a way to change the settings
Actually, I am using VF9 and VF8, if you change lanes without signal then your wheel will vibrate a bit to warn drivers about danger and I think that every modern car has this function however it don't prohibit you to turn lanes if you deciding to do that. I am vietnamese and for your information, first car of Vinfast named VFe34 (only operate in Vietnam) has software system  with many errors at the time they run on the road but after one year and half, Vinfast fixed all errors and now this car can run smoothly and VF8 also now can go smoother. However, I guarantee all of you that The chassis system and hardware of Vinfast cars are better than other cars in the same segment. Anyway, I recommend you guys, please go to test drive yourself if you have time, then you will feel the quality exactly
Sounds like a flat tire
Lol when you mentioned C2k77 and NML I wanted to give you a standing ovation. We need better international laws around selling unfinished products.
I work on cars, and let me tell you. I have sat in New cars for far longer than one minute and eighteen seconds trying to start them. Even gas models are insane now. Car engineering is broken now. Nothing is familiar from one car to the next.
Give em another chance!
What a Pile of crap. 50 grand?! Straight up junk!
At this point they’re trying to die
Almost every single one of these "green" startups are utter grifters.
I can't help wonder if the negative views of this cars has something to do with the country of origin. People panned the hell out of the Daewoo Lanos/nubira (Korean) in the 90s but they were a GM  car and when rebadged as Chevys people bought them. They were rather shoddy but they sold when rebadged with an American brand.  People are kind of biased against Asian cars including Japanese brands and Japanese brands are typically pretty reliable and well built.
VF8 round 2
VF8 is a fugly car, who looks at that and say 'oh yeah, 50k, I'll buy it' ?
The dig on No Man Sky and Cyber Punk is epic and spot on!  Nowdays video game release is just bad, though they patch afterwards (mostly).  But come on… a car that puts drivers into DOA situation wtf!! (Tesla does it too, but at least they are good enough to not be noticed…)
What a weird joke car company
I would love to see you test out the "Fixed" version, or like others mentioned, the patch performed on the car you drove. But what I really want to see is a test of the *Aptera* . You guys are basically neighbors lol
Vinfast rebadge Geely cars
i gotta say i never want any car with driving aids, i would prefer my car unable to see
I'm sorry, I love you guys and listen to your podcast every Monday but James, you chewing gum while recording yourself makes you seem like a bit of a douche
Thank you for shouting out No Mans Sky. Somebody's a real gamer at Donut
Lol, fixed over the air???. So why this car not getting fixed. So software update can fix the suspension issue too?
i think it's made by bmw and assembled in vietnam. lol.
Do it!
Wow that car sucks 😂
saying bad publicly about them in VN means trouble to those who dare :))
Please do a up to speed on Smokey
Các bạn có muốn xem xe vinfat chết máy nằm đường ở việt nam không😂
if a company is handing out money to make you less worried about car issues that is VERY bad red flag
Saturn always the worst
As a motorcycle rider I would like to see this car banned. This will kill someone
Uhhhhh...when u change lanes u always have to manually turn off the blinkers
In Britain they have a car called a Dacia sandero that's a piece of shit to
This is a bad car. In Vietnam, if the weather is too hot, you can't even use the car's air conditioner.
Không biết mấy người này lấy thông tin ở đâu mà nói sai hoàn toàn VINFAST thành lập 2017 và bán lux a 2018 đến 2021 mới ra xe điện là VF8 thôi chỉ trông 2 năm thôi là qua Mỹ rồi 😢.
Giới thiệu về VINFAST sai hoàn toàn nha.😢
I bet the chimes going off all over the car were put there to mate the Vietnamese transplants feel at home. When riding in a car of on my motorbike in Saigon and Can Tho, everyone is tooting their horns whenever they are moving near someone else. It was explained to me as a friendly beep to signal their location. So yeah, after a week I wore out my horn button.
A game being garbage at launch so it crashes a lot is diffirent to being a car at launch that crashes a lot.....
For now, it really looks like the company has done a step that's too big, being over-ambitious with a product that isn't ready.
They should change there name to vinslow
Does driving with the 4 ways on eliminate that no lane change problem?
Pretty bad there no start up button wtf
All electric cars are the same. There is no "startup sequence"... just get in the car and go. If you like a "drivers" car then electric is not for you
This is what happens when you want to switch everything to electric 🙄
Elctric vehicles is not easy for car makers as they all have so many problems. I never have in my mind a thougt about EV cars as a future of automobile. But it’s awesome to see some cool features and futuristic design of an EV car yet it still has flaws but at least they tried. Hope Vinfast can fix it and wish them the best.
sthey should renam the car with SINKfast. lol
I'm always ready for a good underdog story so I'd love to see a re-test after the software update. Hopefully this company survives in the States. It would be sort of sad if they retreat back to Vietnam.  They need to hire proper designers like Kia did. Give the people something to intrigue them, not just a brick on wheels.
Sounds like the car pays for itself 🤷🏼
I live in SE Asia, and Vietnam is sooo proud of themselves with this company.   It is literally headline news "1st vinfast to exported to US today!!!" etc.   I really hope that they learn from the obvious mistakes but honestly don't believe they have the same government discipline of Japan Korea.    It is more like the new version of Malaysia's proton unfortunately
In all fairness, the startup is pretty similar to a Tesla where the car is already on when the key enters the vehicle. Very weird if you’re used to driving gas cars like the majority of the people watching
the audi Q4 etron has a similar start up as well. As soon as you get in its on and you can throw it in drive only difference theres a start button. You can get out and car will shut off, in fact if your inside w the car on in drive and you take your butt off the seat itll shut off
They should’ve have you guys drive the cars without knowing it’s most common complaints to see what complaints you guys have to the average consumer
Holy shit this was the weird ass car I saw the other day
James getting some grey
rushed released game hurt nothing but your wallet and disk space, BUT CAR!? WE GOT EARLY RUSHED RELEASED CAR NOW!?
How much Tesla pay you guy's for this commercial 😂😂😂😂
"There's room for improvement," Elon Musk joked.  Let's see what they can do in the future.
funny enough, i heard nothing about bad reviews in Vietnam, many of us thought they are good 🤣
It blows my mind how new cars look so nice while being massive POS. As long as it's shiny somebody will want it right?
EVs can be shut off remotely by anyone
The problem is  Its too furious
the "shudder" in reverse (and also drive) is triggered by a "safety" feature. the parking brakes remain locked if your seatbelt is not on, and one set of wheels still turns under power. so if you put it into gear and press the accelerator fully, the car will force the brakes and shudder heavily.
In China, I bought a Zeeker 001 with around $40K. Why the EV is so expensive in US?
:)) As an ex-vietnamese nationality, I have to say the Communism do nothing but shit work xD  And for those who doesn't know, the whole Vin Group (owner of Vinfast) is just a big ass money wash company for the communism party there.
Go for it
I drove the worst game update in history caused by you so there is that.
Problem with building cars using the modern video game development cycle is that a major issue with a car can literally kill people.  Look at the massive number of battery fires in China from the BYD blade batteries (that one also likely comes down to good ol fashioned Chinese corner cutting).
I wonder how much longer until cars literally won't allow you to break the speed limit..
Vin not so fast!!!!!
You folks at donut NEED to make an episode showing off the new engine InnEngine developed. I believe it needs to be brought to light on how cool and innovative it is!!
This shit is probably 90% made in China!
For a future video you shuold try different radars on lead paint from army trucks.
No way that car should be sold for $50K. Even if or when all the updates are available and bugs are worked out, it’s way overpriced.
Jus wanted to come on here to give y’all boys props Fr. Y’all went from a relatively small channel for making ads for full blow car companies so quick. Love y’all man keep growing !
I'm vietnammes. I totally agree to this reviews. Actually in Vietnam we found more and more problems than that. Especially the problems are very very denger. But media in Vietnam bought/control by VF that why nobody know about it. Finally this thing (vf car) is very  denger, Please keep away this thing for you and  your community safe!
I can attest to this allegation from reviewers. They heavily priced it and my friend bought it cause he's vietnamese and wanted to support his country. He returned it within a month. Got mad that he spent so much when he could have got a toureg instead. The chimes were the biggest annoyance. He went back to the dealership and they said it's common and there isn't a way to turn alerts off. The reverse shuddering being tested once isn't even valid as it's random. He had it two times with me inside one of the times and I said take it back cause it sounds like transmission issues. He would have it in drive and then swap to reverse and then it would just shudder and then smooth out. He did go get it checked and they said it's fine. Suspension was also an issue as he lived in socal for a long time driving a toyota sequoia and when he got this suv he had a headache everytime he went to see his family. Some highways and streets near his parents house is patchy and bumpy so he felt everything.   This is definitely a vehicle that should have been tested by not just one guy in vietnam being biased towards the company and more like a few employees driving them home and to work and to do random vacationing and such to actually report the issues. But they didn't and the customer is the one that has to suffer because the company isn't even doing the miles to experience their own vehicle. 50k for a start up company is stupid.
A Vinfast dealership opened in my area & their cars are extremely dusted over. Their back lot looks like those vehicles have not been touched since they were parked there. It's insane that they wouldn't even bother to keep them clean lol
Dang, you guys driving that car in LA traffic must be scary.   I’m sad that VinFast isn’t getting good reviews, I hope that VinFast would correct it’s issues.
Again, in 20 years this will be a cars and coffee car like a Yugo
Reminds me of the newer BMW 5 series I rode in when it came to ride quality. I don't know if the previous renter jumped it and destroyed the shocks but it had the most bouncy and nauseating ride I have experienced in a functioning modern car. Had to have it in sport mode to control the body, and it still was too bouncy.
It's terrifying that we live in an era where car manufacturers are following in the footsteps of videogame developers: Release a broken product, then fix it later with downloaded updates...except in this case it's not a game, it's a two-ton death machine barreling down the road at 70 mph.
It reminds me of my Hyundai Excel from the late 80s. 😂 Just give them 30 years or so, they will start making decent cars.
I can’t believe this costs more than a base Model Y
Nah you guys are just idiots to NOT read the instructions
I’m noticing you got rid of sunroof. I’ll finish watching. Maybe you say why.
Follow Up! Follow Up! Follow Up!
Tbh it sounds like these journos are Musk fanbois who got bribed to rate this car down. Definitely quirky but it doesn’t seem bad. I’d probably rather go for a mach-E at that price but it’s not horrid.
Not being able to find the drive/on button is a safety feature to prevent theft.
follow-up yes please.  I would love to see progress, and also a new manufacturer enter the market on principle, so I absolutely think they deserve a chance to figure their sh*t out and try to redeem themselves
All reimbursements will be through the Ukrainian thus fund.
Absolutely no way it’s worth MORE than a Mach-E … which you can actually get serviced and you know the company will be around for more than a year.
Wtf. Low quality video
Ho Chi Car!
Not only are they selling a terrible unfinished car, they also are pushing for a subscription based battery where you get charged for driving your car more then 300 miles a month on top of the charge to drive those 300 miles. Yes, I am being serious. Look this up. I genuinely want this company to go under
SOLD!  Buying one tomorrow!!!
Hey man cyberpunk worked on PC
Im surprised donut hasnt made a video of nascar in le mans
That car would definitely work in India but needs to be a lot cheaper like 10X cheaper
BMW owners here wondering why the car won’t turn 😭
Saw one of those ahead of me in the drive thru a few weeks ago, i was wondering what the hell it was but i forgot the name by the time I got home 😂 it look really cheap, i thought was some weird courtesy vehicle or fleet vehicle.
Vinfast reinvents the wheel. Produces cabbage.
Yeah, that start up sequence were all things you'd do when you start any car ,  minus the key
It’s also worth noting this car also competes with the Tesla Model Y, you know the world’s top selling car (gas and electric) so far in 2023. It wasn’t mentioned in this video because Tesla doesn’t sponsor YouTubers.
Of course it is electric trash.
I’m glad James is back
🎉it looks good 😂😂😂
Natalie about to trade it in lmao
No thank you I will stick with my Toyota 😅
I'm more offended by that price than the quality. The car should be selling for about $15k. Also, I intensely dislike cars with a choppy ride.
Take Nolan off. Nerddd
Vinfast is for Majority of BMW and Mercedes owners. Signal or die.
Just put a gas engine in it 😂
Crazy thought, maybe not do a review while your chomping on gum…
It's a newer vehicle so it's a bit understandable that it has its issues teslas literally drives itself into store fronts and people don't complain about that though but the feedback is good nonetheless
This company is known for sending cops to arrests and threatens people in Vietnam who complained publicly about how shit it is. The rich vietnamese in the US also made a shit ton of posts on social media about how "good" this brand is and brag about how many Vinfast cars they bought.  It's a piece of shit of a car and a gimmick.
So-called "Made in Vietnam" but with EV parts and technology 100% from China
do a follow up...please   heck they could be like toyota with the camry in the end....slow but steady improvements.....
developing a car the same way you develop a software is just criminal
I’m all for more competition and Vinfast is no exception, but it should be common sense for ANY company to not launch a new product that is plagued with multiple issues. Did the engineers even do their job? It makes me wonder if Vinfast knew about the issues and instead focused on rushing the launch of the car, which is obviously not good. Vinfast needs to take a step back and address these things before going on a full scale launch of their cars. The company is too ambitious about their goals and while that’s not a bad thing, they should know better to not rush things. If they don’t address their issues, it’s ultimately going to backfire on them.
Start up should be intuitive. Not like trying to figure out how to operate a new touchpad device.
Who chews gum while recording?
The looks may not warrant the 50k price tag but it looks like most issues can be resolved with software updates.  Except for the suspension, they may need a recall for that.
are you kidding?! getting 100$ per day! for every day the tesla was in service would have made thousands. couple weeks to adress all the issues that came from delivery... like squeaking and paint issues. and then another couple weeks after the motor made noises and needed to be replaced. or a week to get some sensor fixed that did not allow the car to go fast. not to mention the waiting times to get an appointment at all. well .... that 100$ a day sounds not that bad.
why not just perfect the car before putting it into production. this isnt a phone its an automobile, i dont want updates just to get my car working
Car companies are start to pull a AAA video game, release the product broken, fix a few things and abandon it, not to mention the attempt at monetization, people need to avoid cars doing this like the plague before it becomes the standard
Yall keep crashing my forza horizon 5 when i try and do the last mission for the DONUT missions.
they released this car like a video game.... its like they bought early access on an EA game XD
Honestly the car itself looks pretty nice physically.  If they can get things under control a bit with the QC and get their price down a bit they could be a decent player.
Shame on any American buying this garbage from the Vietcong.
Sure this car is garbage but tbe Hyundai has the same issues with also some of the worst customer service and safety recall systems in the entire auto industry. If i had to choose this or the ionic, I'd choose the viet car.
crying out loud just yell to get started
I bet it still has fewer problems than my Cadillac !
Because you guys failed to make a “Birds need to chill out” I don’t like and comment. I disliked and commented. Shame of a channel.
EV reviewers are all paid by MUSK to leave negative reviews🔺
DO OVER
Maybe that car was designed for actual roads not California ones
Sat in one at an Auto Show, possibly THE most hard and uncomfortable seats ever. A park bench was more comfortable...
Viet Cars，Lol
99.7% of people don’t even use blinkers
Hyundai was a joke when they first entered the U S market
Please don't tell me manufacturers are going to turn into the gaming industry with cars being launched too early and then rely on updates to fix the issues.
I don't want to spend $50 grand for that piece of sh**, thank you for your video.
That’s what happens when you do money laundering and just rush a product to earn favors. I doubt they would be so stupid to not know about those issues. They have a secret agenda.
Go for it, test it after the reprogramming.
EV are not "green" nor are they good for the environment. I'll never drive them and stick to my diesel and gas engines. Enjoy all those kids digging in lithium mines and virtue signaling.
I wanna see a follow up with an A/B comparison
Apparently now we have early-access cars lol if the founder wasn't a billionaire I would ask what they raised on kickstarter
Here’s a little something I learn about Vietnamese developed goods: Just look but don’t touch, you touch and it will break!
Find any punji sticks under the seats?
do they even have drinkable water in vietnam
Lots of customers have problem with brand new Vinfast cars in Vietnam after they bought. But the biggest problem is if you post on YouTube when many times you got turned down by Vinfast, they’ll take you to police station. That’s the way the Communist handle the jobs when the big boss said so. If you have lots of money, you can control those who work for the Communist.
just one more asian scrap. Why should I buy a car made in Vietnam? I can buy a Made in USA o Made in Europe cars, much better!!!
50 thou, same weight as a pickup. not reliable.  stick to my bike
100% do a follow-up! let's see if their money is where their mouth is. they could actually start to fix their reputation if they do what they say
EV automakers like Lucid, Rivian and Faraday Future (forthcoming) have spent a minimum of ten years developing their power trains, battery technology and proprietary software for operation. If VinFast had some of their tech in development stage before the VF8 was released for consumer sales, it wouldn't have made a difference, because of the actual design of the steering, suspension and powertrain development. The founder should have known that, yet we're all human, and make mistakes in many ways.
These cars come with INSTRUCTIONS. Why not READ THEM FIRST? What do americans have against reading instructions!?!?
High vs low on fossa Horison five
Thumbnail looks like haircut in middleschool from 2002
Yep, buying from foreign companies that are yet to be proven or even new cars from known companies is not the best idea, it's best to wait for the reviews before you buy it, you never know how trash a car can be, just like a videogame.
Stabbing at the accelerator rapidly should cause a flag in the computer's logic system. Why? because there's no reason for anyone to do it, but it could very well be caused by an intermittent short or open issue in the control system, since (of course) it's fly by wire.   It would have been smarter, in my opinion, for Vinfast to take the original Japanese manufacturer approach of establishing themselves in a new market first by being a manufacturer of simple, reliable, and economical vehicles. For example, the original Civics and Corollas of the 1970's, in contrast to today's upmarket Lexus and Acura. Build the reputation and following first, then move upmarket later.
it's like early access on a CAR
This car is still in Alpha
Ok but why are you guys wearing sweaters? It’s July in LA lol two shirts really? That’s weird
LOL i cant imagine trying to justify this when there is so many better options on the market for less
Are they going to fix ride quality with software?
>Names car “VF8” >Is electric My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
that Pham Nhat Vuong's originally selling Instant Noodles in Ukraine ,,,he got the good connection with Communist official in Vietnam government so he invested into the real estate in Vietnam and robbed number of lands and sold with million% profit ...and then he moved to Singapore started another company called Vingroup. He made Vinfast subsidy of Vingroup parent company....Vinfast makes car with bunch of stuffs even programming from China!  OMG you hammered down the acceleration paddle and it didn't move?????
God, a start button,or I don't know,a key, and a noise so you know it's on! I had a hire car (Opel insignia) and warning sounds were a pain to, lane assist was a pain wouldn't let me leave lane without turn indicators on,borderline dangerous,but the collision warning saved me once because the warning sounds for other vehicles being to close to me beside me and to the rear, I looked where the warning was coming from and didn't see the car Infront stand on the brakes. The forward collision warning is good but all the other proximity warnings are a bit to much.
Gee, I thought I was a true gearhead but while I live in America I have never seen a printed or video review of this car.  If it was reviewed SOLELY by Canadians, please change the title.  Yes, I have HEARD of this brand, but really, it has no presence in AMERICA.
If the car won't change lanes without the blinker being on doesn't that make emergency avoidance kind of impossible or is the car going to do that for me?
Unfortunately, EV people are fanboys and will buy a car just for being an EV and not bother looking into the brand/vehicle. If you ask me they deserve what they get for just buying something just because its an EV
Welcome to our new Vietcong gathering point :)
Lane keep is common these days. All cars have that these days but theres a button for that
Released too soon.
they are taking a page from Microsoft:  get a product 60% ready, put it on the market, at FULL MSRP,  let the early buyers be your beta testing team, after they pay for the privilege.
are those reviews chevy shills?
You should do this for more car companies that are sold in US.  Maybe even bikes.  But I know that's a path less travelled
Vinfast's after sale issue -policy is literally illegal, Lemon Law makes it so theyre legally required to buy back the car, full price. They dont get a 4 day repair time with $100, they get a car back & a $50000 bill by law. This is some class action lawsuit nonsense.
Sorry...I can't ignore that Company's name sounds like a diet drink.
Let me introduce you to a group of vinfast fanatics in Vietnam. We often call them "vin slaves" which translates to vinfast slaves. As a Vietnamese. We are very proud that our country can build a car on its own. But, VIN slave made us change that mind. Whenever a car has a problem, we usually pay attention to when they fix the problem, or when someone posts a question like should I buy a vinfast car. We often take risks like it is full of bugs, it takes time to stabilize. (Because a car in Vietnam is a pretty big asset, not just a means of transportation, you can look up the GDP of my country.). So Vin the slave got involved. they flatter that the quality of the car makes Tesla smell smoke, that the electric car company is the third largest in the world (apparently bought by some big company in the US). When we proved that those words were lies, they said, "Do you have money to buy a car or still ride an old motorbike", very superior. I believe that when you scroll through the comments, you will read a few comments like that. To say that, Vinfast is still young and needs time to develop more. However their sales department in Vietnam is funny. The "pioneers" buy a vinfast LUX A for about 50k. But later to attract market share, they launched discounts like If you buy a house VINHOME you will receive a discount card of 8k USD. And you can merge up to 3 cards. Yes 3 cards you can buy in the black market, a lot of them cost only about 4k usd. How do you feel about doing this? I just repeat that it is a lot of money for us. You love the brand, you support it, then one day you wake up and your car loses almost half its resale value.
These guys are so lucky. This sort of review in VN by any vietnamese would be jailed. Yes JAILED. BTW can I ask wete you 2 paid to include  the update at the end of the video?
Let's Go! Part 2!
Should have drove a new car ..not Natalie’s car that was like car #1….mine didn’t do any of these things..lmao! Great review!
How would such hazerdous assistant be allowed on the road?
There's a suspicious amount of background Honda Civics in this video
Any updates on the 500 dollar Honda coming soon 😢
Perhaps general understanding how the car works could help your driving experience.
I have none of these issues…have no idea what your problem is.
nolan's anime dub gasp is on POINT
Burn the vf8
I am Vietnamese and i have known that: no parts or components of the car made in Viet Nam. Where parts made ?? I have been thinking it made in China. Finally, i never buy it, even to receive it freely...
I hope you gave the owner 100$ per day of filming.
I'd rather walk than be stuck in one of these hell buckets.
Way too much yakking and not enough actual testing. I'm not sitting through all the crap. I'm out of here.
Honestly they lost me at vietnamese. I'm not buying a car from that country.
It would be nice if the guy in the blue jacket would shut up.
It doesn't help that it's got an absolutely uninspiring, generic design down to the logo.
The startup sequence is how I feel about Roku tvs. We've been making TVs since the 50s and suddenly we don't need a Channel or volume button on the TV
2 unanswered questions: •What makes an owner "Eligible?" •Who owns the batteries in that car?
Uh the start up is you just get in the car, push the brake, and put it in drive... That's how they should be.
In Vietnam, every vehicle driver beeps their horn when passing another. Driving down the highway, it is incessant horn beeps...drives one crazy. Maybe that's why they had the chimes when another car approached...saves from having to beep the horn...lol
I will not purchase one of these shit boxes
Looks like a renault megane
No one likes to be told they're speeding. The Chime: "beep, beep, beep, beep, beep"
Changed "sunroof" to "drive aid on the board.. there is alot of shit stuck to it, I get it.
I'd be careful about criticizing Vietnamese products. They might kick our butts again!
I don't envy any up and coming car company. You have to get every little thing right. I remember when hyundais and kias were a joke. And now look at them. So what we are expecting off the bat is something that takes generations
Much better than crappy murican gm etc.
What a terrible car. They can’t even put the steering wheel on the correct side 🤣
We are at the point where just like video games, cars are being released unfinished, and being patched later lol
They should sell it for like 30,000 call it a starter EV 😁
Quality Control and FIELD TESTING would show ALL these problems probably in a few hundred miles???
u gott do it
50k for a pos "lemon"  HARD PASS
Please do a Hi Low car on a Ferrari 1988 308 QV. So in that way see it in Forza Horizon 5
Worse than a Dodge Neon base model?
Those issues are fine, for a 20k car
I've lived in Vietnam they are definitely the kind of people who get s*** done and they don't mess around If they want something done they do it and do it as quickly as possible sometimes sacrificing quality but they make it happen
Its volkswagEn not volkswagOn guys 0:40
i'm just excited that Vietnam is getting on the map.  I remember when Korea starting importing cars, that took a bit of time for people to warm up to.
You must have more money than brain to put 50k BEFORE TAX on a up and coming car. That is way too much for a new car brand to charge. Laughably so. Edit: As a Vietnamese person, the whole After Sales Policy is so typical Vietnamese. They're not dealing with it in the Western way, they're dealing with it like a bunch of country bumpkins, low level approach for hicks. The kinda stuff you see in trashy car sale lots. Edit: Just so people know, Vietnam WANTS to be as corrupted as China, but they're too poor to pull it off to that level. The rich are really rich because they majorly exploit the massive amounts of loopholes and corruption in the country. I barely trust my own people more than I trust the CCP. I wouldn't trust them to not cut dangerous corners in their products. They might have the attention of the U.S. since the falling of China, but as soon as they get the upperhand, watch how they show you their true faces.
The fact car companies are starting to follow the video game logic of release it now and fix it later is terrifying. If your car has to receive updates after it's sold then it's a bad car.
Please give me your thoughts on this. If there is a lag on the accelerator, would be safe in some situation like when a person panic and hit the gas, which might end up in an accident? May be that was what they were going for? Potentially?
I would like to see another video with the software updates. Vinfast lost my trust a long time ago.
so Natalie Lee, this VF8 owner, get a protype car ?! This is bad Natalie , unless you get it for free from Chinfast 🫤
If a car takes more that 5 seconds to enter, start, and put into gear. It is too complicated!
Where’d zach and the civic?
The "Accel problem" you demonstrated wasn't any worse than turbo lag.
I'd like to see Vinfast succeed. It may be a rushed product that no one should buy, but if their customer service and interaction with the media remains positive, then why wouldn't it succeed in time?
Personally, I don't care for a post _"software update"_ follow up when the suspension alone makes it worse than all of its competition.
@savagegeese when are you going to get this car?.😂. Can’t wait.
Can't change lane if not indicating. No good for anyone coming from a BMW.
The maker must be a fan of the FF series.
20k too much
Props to Vinfast for adding turbo lag to an EV
Electric cars are the future! The future: ... If I can't drive it and be in control of the 2 ton death vehicle I am inside, then it's not road worthy. That drive assist is borderline moronic.
50k for this?!? I wouldnt pay 15k for it.
Imagine you lost your job interview because the car broke down on the street, and Vinfast was like here $100 for your lost.
BMW drivers would never switch lanes
I would love to see a follow up video for this.  Interested to see if it gets better.
...HENRY GRAY GUBLER?!
I'm not sure if it's a good car, but the VF8 is downright ugly, with a face only Pham Nhat Vuong would love.
That's the problem with the race to electric cars. You have battery powered motors being controlled by software which is interpreting Human input based on whatever logic was used to compile that overall platform. They know that people will pay to be beta testers. Apple already proved that business model. No thanks. I want nothing to do with it.
I'm interested in the Volkswagon ID.4.
One major mistake many drivers do when driving a new car, is they never read the manual before they operate the vehicle. They imagine they can use every car ,by experience from previous cars.  Ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't fly an airplane which you think you can fly but not really knowing much about it's actual operation, right?  Never underestimate a car as well. A car with clueless operators could also become fatal, especially with the complexity of the electronics and their features
hi, a vietnamese here. This is the first time i have ever heard of insight about this car although im local to this model (since vinfast control the media quite aggressively). So, i have several surprises after watching this -The car is actually cheaper than in Vietnam (same msrp, but Vietnam has like 15k worth of voucher to make it up). To put into perspective, old model crv cost 50k and performance car cost x3 -its actually less bugs than i expected. i have read on forum about a man got his battery died twice, one time on highway at night, without any road lights, with tons of issues like couldnt turn the signal on. But yeah, mostly battery issue. About softwere, my mom who has some of her friends work at vinfast said they are trying to not rely on existing patent to cut down cost (by making their own technology). And apparently, they can fix bugs that fast bcs there are tons of vf8 running as taxi (and also users' complaints) About that sensitive sensor, I think its because of the traffic in Vietnam. Basically its like a junior version of India, a bit safer but fkin insane In the end, dont buy this car. It is indeed unfinished product and even with vietnamese like me, its not very wise to buy this. Unless, you are given the voucher, living in Vin facility and wants to buy an electric car in Vietnam
If a new electric car company really wanted to stand out in the market, they should sell it on simplicity. Sure, the drive motor and controller should use the best tech available, the A/C and battery cooling system requires some complexity to be efficient, but everything else needs to focus on reliability, simplicity, and repairaibility.  It almost feels like US car makers in the  80s again, the focus seems to be on flash while the design decisions are focused strictly what is best for the manufacturer, not on delivering a product for the customer.
You mean nissan altima?
I saw idiots buying these at the LA Auto Show last year. I laughed so damn hard and saw this coming. Lmao.
Even the consumers back back in Vietnam - my home country - avoid this automaker like the plague lol.
Man, I don't have the time to type all the words. Just wow. I LOVE IT.
id.4 at 37k? sure lol
I will keep my gasoline powered ScatPack thankyouverymuch. I can turn without blinkers, I can stomp the gas pedal and go really, really fast, with lots of smoking tires.  I don't have anybody trying to second guess my driving ability. And my car looks totally badass in Hellraisin' Purple.
I can't help but root for little Vietnam... after we dropped more bombs then ww2 the fact they have car manufacturer is impressive... it's not easy building a car that competes against companies that have been doing so for decades...😎👌
I noticed some other things on the list that weren't mentions, "Rolling" and "Sunroof"?
So nitty gritty.. ride quality isnt that great is what i see and can have annoying chimes. Even the pedal.  Dude really? Go try a prius and see how it drives. No one slams a pedal like that. Anyway... its a meh car but everyone is waaay over btching about it
I cant understand how even someone can buy this car 😅 . “Oo hey lets go and spend 50k on random small hatchback from Vietnam “😅😅😅 Must be something seriously wrong in this persons brain
You guys are trying to hang with the big auto magazines but really misspelled "Volkswagon". 💀  Edit: you also said the suspension was underdampened. So you want it yo be more dampened? The suspension needs to be wetter? Damping is the word youre looking for. Come on guys, this is stuff you can google.
Is the issue with the drive quality the car’s fault or California’s?
For over $50k I would have expected better
You should drive a new Subaru with these drive aids. Same thing. Terrible. Slams on brakes for no reason, jerks you into the lane, says you’re out of the lane when you’re directly in the middle. No way to turn any of it off
Gotta love no reason fish eye
Stupid reasons jesus. The first few are like wtf then ya got chines and driving aid etc.. oh shut up lol YOU all are critiquing that? For one, turn it all off, and two, you ALL drive old pos cars like most of us that do not even have the OPTION for most of this stuff, and its a reason to hate or criticize a car? Look i wouldnt spend 50k on this car but im half way into the vid and... none of thise stuff is bothering me at all nor is it like there are solutions. I mean damn. I got an 07 corolla and im fine, im sure turning off most of the nonsense things will be fine for most others too.
Yes, let’s go for round two
If you ever create a "Did Vinfast fix their issues" video, I highly recommend including a fun getaway skit.
Looks like a Cupra
There's BYDs, NIOs, Zeekers, yet this bullshit is the asian EV they're selling in the US?? Go figure.
The startup sequence is the same as a prius lol.
😂😂😂 what is your channel? I will kill your clip😂😂😂
Well it's an EV so understandably it's garbage.
It is good car
Just don’t like the name. “Vinfast” sounds anything but fast 😂. The design looks cheap and outdated, the logo looks like a Citroen knockoff
Doug DeMuro do your thing
You cant bring a new product to market that has no reputation and expect to charge as much or more than established models.
From vietnam thanks you about truth , vinphet is phuck kkk😂
James do an up to speed on the company!
If they get all the issues sorted out then it’ll be nicknamed Vinfast vinfurious with the theme wrapped in a Toyota Supra wrap.   oh wait did we forget the 2JZ engine?
50K? hell no, maybe at 25K  update: no at 25k either.
Absolutely agree with the remark at the end: we've had electric cars, now it's time to make cars... that happen to be electric powered. Not a starship that needs to reach warp 6 faster than you can say "Engage!" even if it's a large luxurious offroader.
TBH to you guys, I have a feeling that VinGROUP (The mother company of Vinfast) is trying to do some shady shit to raise capital and take more cash loan from using its own companies for collateral.  The VINGROUP is burning cash like crazy.
3:30 You go slightly in the other direction and the turn signal turns off? Sounds like a VW Passat to me.
Great video, follow up needed
Why is starting up the car an issue. Isn’t that exactly how teslas work? They don’t have a start button either and you have to push it into D to start driving.. oh wait !! It’s Musks company so that is acceptable but this is not.. makes complete sense
It’s kinda sad to see where this vehicle is at. They’ve invested a lot of money trying to get in to one of the hardest and least profitable markets: The U.S car market.
So donut media is also woke, nice. Time to never watch again
The car ahead of me slams into another and explodes.  I try to swerve around it in the one second I have until impact, but I can't, because my survival instincts don't include a turn signal, now I crash.  That idiot car will never make it over here.
The people who love to shit on Teslas need to take a spin in one of these and recalibrate their definition of a bad car.
It is nice to see another vendor with an EV in America, but I am more excited to see the heritage automakers start embracing EVs.  I would much rather have a Ford Mustang Mach E than even a Tesla.
Sunroof was on the list, then just ...gone?
Review a Fisker ocean !! When you start seeing them on the road !
The 2nd time, and everytime henceforth, that the driver starts the car, will probably take 4 seconds.  So, not really a problem.  Car dealers would usually point out the start system, and many other functions, before the buyer pays for it.
Doesn't look like it's from the future? That's the WORST part about EVs... they all look like garbage.
It would be nice to have a basic EV without all the bullshit.
Give Vinfast another shot!
while this is hysterical to watch, I do have to wonder...how many of the "annoying to US drivers" aids/chimes are necessary for the traffic in Viet Nam?  (country of origin)?  If you're driving in Viet Nam's normal traffic, not being able to change a lane might be important protection...along with all the others chimes.
Yes please do a follow up video.
I have a drawer where I put all my old cell phones in, how big will it have to be in order to put all the old electric cars in when I’m done with them?
Why didn't the car that you drove get the updates?  Sounds like another fail at their end.
Knowing how Vietnamese businessmen operates (I love Vietnam and Vietnamese people, but Vietnamese businessman are the worst),  if they get a whiff of this video they are going to annoy the hell out of you to give them the best review there is. Expect bribes, vague menace, negotiating, etc, maybe not in that order, maybe not sequentially. Good luck. And I repeat, this is not against Vietnamese people, you are amazing, guys and gals. Anyways, any Vietnamese will agree with me on that.
did china pay you to do this video?
feels like they never really tested this car and are having customers do the QA/QC for all their cars
About to start my first project car. When is there going to be a Donut sunstrip?? Couldn't change a tyre 3 months ago but you guys got me hooked!
I’m try to understand, how they can correct the stiff suspension on the online update 😂😂😂😂
I approve of the not letting you change lanes without a turn signal, as long as the assist is able to make the determination between the driver is an asshole and there is a hazard in the road ahead.  Use your turn signals assholes.
You just wrote off SUNROOF apparently
Thank you for   your honest review. If you guys were in Vietnam, the police will come  and knocking your door because   You give honest bad review,  Vinfast had bribed government to shut down any bad saying.
Complains about lane assist keeping the car in the lane and jerking the wheel BECAUSE THEY ATTEMPTED AN ILLEGAL LANE CHANE >.> BRUH CMON 🤨😟😒
These guys are lucky because they live in US. In Vietnam, they could end up at the Court or jail to say any bad about Vinfast
0$: Vinfast Car is awful 500K$: It's fixed
Easy to offer $$ to people for problems with their car when you sold like 150 of em 😂
delay in acceleration pedal is really bad, just think a situation, you see car comign fast on your side, not caring about traffic light, you can survive if you react fast enuff and go full throttle, no can do tho if the car takes a second to respond xD
Rlly sorry for international users !😅 It is originally made under the transportation rules of vietnam Might be slower in the US or EU
This car is evidence as to how far cars have come in the past twenty years. Even the least expensive new car on the planet has a better suspension than this thing.
I never liked EVs, and this P.O.S. makes me trust them even less! 😤
please follow up. make them put their money where their mouth is
Poop car
I'm vietnamese, and I agree with you, vf is the worst car ever
Why would anyone choose this over a model y?
Run it back
Lol they should install the need for signal feature on some cars. Not pointing any fingers
Let’s see if the update works
Absolutely do a follow up. This car sounds intriguing.
As a Vietnamese, thanks for your honest review. If we, a Vietnamese reviews as fair as you are, a numerous vinfast fans will curse and yell at me as an evil enemy.
Review it again. You Americans owe it to Vietnam.
Would be good to have some useful information like what does it cost to fully charge and how does that compare to gas ? Also Vinfast was talking about buying the car and renting the battery does 50,000 include the battery or do you have to pay a monthly rental charge . I see cars like Tesla getting 7,500 rebate does Vinfast qualify if not why not ,. The car does have a 10 year warranty however that may not help if this company folds . The VF 8 and the VF 9 are both interesting designs by the famous Italian design houses however nothing that would get people’s attention. The new smaller VF 7 will be a much more attractive car for less money ironically so I wouldn’t write this company off yet they have made many different models of cars over the last 4 years in an amazingly short time . One thing not addressed is what is the duty on these currently made in Vietnam cars ? Currently American made cars sold in Vietnam have a 300 % duty they are very expensive I would think the USA would also put a major tariff on these made in Vietnam cars .
Just remember the Hyundai Sonata when it came it to North America was a real POS, my Aunt had one, the depreciation was atrocious, now look at Hyundai's cars, won many awards. I think Vinfast rushed things, however, give these guys 5 years, and I bet you this car company will be winning awards or because of social media, will relaunch elsewhere.
when u build a Modern car of temu I'm shopping like a billionaire
Those reviews were paid by Ford and GM lol
This shit heap costs 50k!? Wtf 😂
At 50K, i'd buy a Toyota or a Honda.
Specs feature cars of Vinfast : "công an Việt cộng"  Are you testing 😂😂😂😂
I would love to see this car do the Moose Test
SUV ev?!  How much range does it have? It must be terible
All the reviewer gonna be mad at this video
So most BLSM doesn't work below a certain speed
I want Vinfast to do well. They’re building a massive facility here in North Carolina which will be great for the local economy, hopefully they can get these issues straightened out.
You likened the release of the car to releases of unfinished video games. I don't like Vinfast's apparently equally video gamey solution of software patches! I do not wish to live in a reality where cars need day one patches!
How do put down hundreds of millions or even billions in RnD and infrastructure to start a motor company and then go with a name like Vinfast. There's coffee shops in alleyways with better names than that.
Looks like Renault
Nas daily been really quite after this video
Tôi phản đối kêng youtuber này với tư cách là người khách hàng đã mua xe. Tôi không đồng ý với đánh giá của kênh này
This is the car for all the BIDEN supporters!
Vinfast was started by Vin diesel thats why they make family cars...
OK, I was watching part of the video, some things right, some things wrong. I also noticed that there are more than thirty five hundred comments and I might say something already mentioned. My Question is - if you have so much money that you can start a brand new car factory - why are you doing it? In my opinion we have already enough different cars (some should not be on the road to begin with), so why add one more? And why an EV? Too many of those as well with way too many problems (check China channels).
they sued Vietnamese owners for complaining about the cars here. I'd say they deserved all of this. What do you expect from a manufacturer abandoned their gas engine after like 1 year of production anyway lul
Ah yes more evidence that the 7th gen honda accord will never be trumped
As a Malaysian, a fellow asean automaker country, I’m thoroughly impressed by how the Vietnamese can make cars better than anything we’ve ever made in just a couple years. If u think this is bad I suggest u search up on Malaysian cars😂
@13:13 - why did you approach this car with any expectations in the first place? You are wrong, not Vinfast.
All right time to prove, it’s not a piece of crap!
To their credit my Mom's Jeep Cherokee beeps like crazy I hate the assist. Turn signal is the worst I've seen, you try to cancel it changing lanes and you gotta fight it to stop turning. Also the accelerator is laggy.
vf8 featured on the newest season of coffin flop
$50k 😂😂
"We'll just patch it in open Beta" isn't a good mentality for a vehicle that can kill you or others. And costs 50,000
why does anyone buy this car did they not go on a test drive?
The starting works exactly like in a Tesla. So that's definitely on the boys for taking that long.  The rest... not so much.
Surprisingly, a few years ago I saw a few reviews that were honest about the car but were mostly fair for a new entry. The big thing was what you get for the price. It was thought to be too high. There are plenty of vehicles to compare it to and find it won’t measure up. Having said that, it’s pretty impressive for a ground up new car created by a ground up start up car company. But like all new companies, they need to have time to fix the bugs. I bet they make a nice car in a few years. I think this review was fair and all encompassing. But like most comments, do a follow up in a few years and see if they make it better.
Hopefully that vinfast can fix some of issue so that can make buyer feel happy about it. Espically in vietnam since there was a lot of brand to choose over.
The shudder in reverse would likely show on an incline, where the auto parking brake feature is engaged. Reversing up a slight incline from park, would do it.
Why would anyone buy a $50k car from a no name company? Imagine owning it for a couple years and the company goes bankrupt making the value plummet and parts availability non existent.
A follow up sounds great for two reasons.  1. To see if the company was bsing or not.  2.  To get a look at the process of making, testing, and fixing a new car.     I get an odd early release feeling from this car.  As in when a game does knowing it’s buggy, but allowing players to help find the issues.  Not a good idea with a car…
follow up !
I definitely want to see a review
Vinf..k probably tried to "bribe" Donuts to remove or change video in their favor. vinf..k has been known to paid popular youtubers 10k and lavish resort packages to visit their "factory" in VN, expecting youtubers praising their faulty cars in return 😂 Early youtubers spent a week in VN at resort but only had about 30 minutes to experience the cars😂
Yeah I’m not trying to beta test a brand new vehicle I purchased only to be partially compensated later lol.
The $300 stuff seems a bit silly, but massive respect for them contacting you.  It seems as though there is a lot of passion and young money behind this car, and perhaps these owners will be rewarded with an extraordinary customer experience.  It would be great if you could get hold of this same car, and the girl could make some $$$ too :)
To be fair on vinfast my Hyundai wouldn’t let me change lanes if I don’t have the trafficator on.
It seems to be in honor of the POS Badge!
Let's face it, the more competition and choice, the more pressure there is on companies to be successful.   A true review, unbiased, is the right thing to do.  And, yes, they should have ironed out the issues beforehand, before Go To Market.  But it is also imperative that updates to the software can be crucial.  As with CyberPunk 2077, the latest patch seems to have fixed most of the issues, maybe worth to play that again....
Cant treat cars like video games and release unfinished product😂
"If you don't have your blinker on, you can't switch lanes." Morally...that's awesome (avoid looking like a Jeep driver). Practically...that's deadly (evasive maneuvers).
Taking the place of Hyundai and Kia as "America's worst car" lol.
Pham  nhat vhong : fam not wrong
So what was up with the sunroof? Seems it disappeared from the list?
As a Vietnamese, I'm sorry.   Our rice and coffee are better.
It needs a 3 day road trip, mountains, desert and ocean. With off pavement excursions! Maybe a heads up drag race with a old Honda 😂
Vin"fast" - what a misnomer.
Chimes try hyundia tucson it constant and they do give you a message or symbol European drivers do not need all these chimes
Let's see how much they can improve their software in a short amount of time.  The suspension though would be a dealbreaker for me.  50K car should be able to ride semi-decent.
E for effort? 😅 Definitely do an update…
I have a 2022 Hyundai Venue and it also jerks you back into your lane if you dont use your blinker to switch lanes. Very annoying
Yes do an updated part 2 plz and be cruel. I'd love to see the crash test results for this vehicle...and other stuff like that.
besides it being a pile of junk, why on earth would anybody spend 50 thousand dollars on a new to market, unproven brand. regardless of the issues, anybody that buys one, deserves what they get.
They made some decent combustion engine cars before, sold domestically (idk if they did sell it outside or not). Those car are designed by Ital Design, engine developed from an old prototype engine they bought from BMW (which is not bad at all). Suddenly one day Vinfast announced that they would stop producing those cars and moved to EVs instead. What a shame...
What happened to the category on the board labeled Sunroof? Was that something that was omitted later on the board?
VinF..k are Chinese cars, assembled in VN. Low quantity, high price, unreliable, but Vinf..k has the largest vc paid commentators on the web. Did you know vinf..k called cops and took a customer to court for complaining about faults on his new car (Lux 2.0) that vinf..k couldn't fix ??? That's how vc operates....😂😂😂 Thanks for the hand-on, straight review guys!!!
I ain't spending the same money for a no name brand that I can for a well known brand, sorry, the warranty ain't worth shit since the company may not be around next year.
I definitely want to see a follow-up!
COMMIE CAR LETS GO
"that's not that crazy". We used to turn the key in the ignition and it was ready to go. Modern cars are needlessly complicated and I will die on this hill.
"the future os electric" the future is stupid.
Why the hell would you buy a Vietnamese made car? Vietnamese industry isn't known for manufacturing prowess.  They're known for jerry-rigging and compromising.
the real question Vinfast VF8 vs Jeep Renegade
i believe Vinfast will get it right
Is that a Coffin Flop shirt?!
Please test this car again once the issues have been resolved. This is a totally new brand, so it would be neat to watch it evolve, right here on Donut!
越南恒大
A BMW driver: What is different? Turnsignals doesn´t matter!
Uh.. so it's an early access car, got it.
There is this trend in every industry now that doesn't even do the bare minimum of quality control before releasing a product. RELEASE A FUCKING FINISHED PRODUCT FOR ONCE!!!
Buy a membership to watch videos lmaooo who tf yall think you are. Byeee...
Gonna appreciated how good those Chinese EVs are...
The name "Vinfast"sounds like a vending machine not a car name.
And some people laugh about Tesla not having enough experience in making cars... jeez. Who in their right mind would pay $50k+ for this when there are TONS of alternatives from guys making cars for like ... 60-100+ years. I would only consider a Vietnamese car if it would be the SAME quality as other big brands but at 1/3 of the price.
Grandpa James without the hat!! 🔥
I saw sooo many of these vehicles when I visited Vietnam for the first time back in January and I had no clue wtf the brand was lol
If you don’t have your blinker on you CAN switch lanes but the car thinks you may be asleep and are lane wandering so it buzzes. You can still lane switch.
wait so your the guys from who are in the festival playlist in forza horizon!?!?
I went to the auto show in LA and on the way in was approach by a woman asking if I'd like to tro sign up to preview a vinfast. I didn't even know she was talking about cars. With a name like that, I honestly thought it was some kind car title or buying service. Wasn't until I saw their booth inside that I realized she had been asking if I wanted to take a riding tour in a car...
Definitely should be no more $20000 after tax. Lol
Cool, saved me $50,000. Thanks. I was researching this car and came across your video.
"In hindsight it's pretty intuitive" ..... that's gotta be some form of oxymoron.
Poor little Timmy, died cause I didn't put my blinker on after he ran out infront of me
I have a few suggestions as follows: 1. you do not understand all the functions in the settings of the vehicle. 2. you should have an expert of Vinfast to follow you to guide you to use. I see you make comments similar to Motor Trend, how long have you been using Vf8 to evaluate the features of such a car? I am Vietnamese and have used Vf8 car and I do not agree with your assessment.
The best thing? Vinfast is building a $2B plant in Moncure, NC...laugh, but Toyota is in bed with Vinfast,including a huge battery plant in Greensboro, so you know who'll end up with the whole schee-bang if Vinfast flops?  Toyota
Vinfast did not design nor manufacture their EVs. They just buy parts from all over the world and put them together (assembled). There’s no their own R&D department.
At 50k its competing with the bmw i4...
"Nataly, thank you! We're sorry." hahahahaa
Vinfast full of hot air lol
Try it again
Follow up! :D
I suspect they’re the company that bought Radio Shack out of bankruptcy…. And is now it’s parts bin
Vinfast thanks all of the owners and reviewers for beta testing their vehicle.  At least they are compensating people to for beta testing...  lol
do it
The kind of cars for suckers who pay way to much for useless tech. I want to see this car after 15 years in bad road conditions. Then MAYBE a possible consideration.
from a styling standpoint, i really do like the look of it.  Hate the name tho.
As a Vietnamese, this is extremely embarrassing. These cars are just cheaply built Chinese cars that is rebranded as Vietnamese cars, fyi.
I'd like to see if it improves
Id never waste 50k on a POS EV 🤣🤣🤣🤣
At this stage, Vinfast is very dependent on China’s supply chain: Ningde era, Guoxuan High-tech provides it with batteries; Feilong shares provide it with electronic water pumps and thermal management control valves; Yidao provides it with millimeter-wave radar; Huayang Electronics provides it Provide HUD; VT provides battery box assembly for it.  "In Vinfast's production line, the coating factory was built by Dürr China, and the welding was built by Guangzhou Mino and fft. Some molds were also participated by suppliers in the Yangtze River Delta, and the content is over the top." An industry insider revealed.  The chip comes from Infineon, the chassis comes from Magna, and the shape design comes from BMW design studio. I haven't found out what really belongs to Vietnam.,, labor and capital.  This is the same routine as your so-called Vietnam 5G product, which is nothing new and technically content, with a sales volume of more than 20,000 a year. It's the first one, so I don't have much to say.  It’s just interesting that the V Group’s annual sales are less than US$4 billion, but it invests US$4.2 billion in new energy vehicles. This is the source of funding. . Interesting.🤣
This car is like the current state of computer games. Released half baked, finish it later.
100% need a follow up video. its like a video game. did the update actually do anything or is it just hogwash
Ill drive a nissan toyota bb more than that car
Video after video for 2 weeks I watch every new one that comes out expecting the 4th episode of the fastest Walmart bike and still… nothing 😢
WHERES THE WORLDS FASTEST BIKE PT.4
Vinfast sounds more like a product you pour down a toilet after elderly relatives have visited, than a car company
Natalie watching the video— why the heck are they stomping on pedal so hard 🤣🤣🤣
So this is where we are at now. Basic QC being done by customers on public roads. I mean, what could *possibly* go wrong?
I'm pretty sure that's the first time I've seen James without a hat on and am shocked to see he has great hair... IDK what I was expecting, but, yeah, shocking.
On the accelerator topic, many modern vehicles with electric throttle bodies have a noticeable delay. I've driven a handful that you could stomp a few times before reacting. I was told it was to help with fuel economy, though I haven't verified that.
This is what China EV’s must be like 😂
Where is the car in the video?..... I only saw a battery pack with imposter syndrome.
Just imagining the Halloween theme playing from the car's beeps.
Wtf happened to Donut. Content is cringy trash now.
Seems like 90 percent of those cars mentioned are barely able to drive enough kilometres.
Stick all ev in junk yards
Maybe do a 6 month update. I think that's plenty of time for them to get it together. Great video guys!
Oh.. your seat belt doesn't retract? How does $100 sound?
Vjn nô đâu ?
@0:38 volkswag0n lol
I will at least give it to them that they are actively trying to fix the issues and compensating drivers
50,000$ is equals 50 honda civic or 50 toyota corolla used but damn sure itll take u from a to b.
Another shake sounds fun.    -I thought living in the future would mean flying cars or jet packs, but turns out it means software patches.
bet this guy just got paid
Oh god... It's DLC FOR CARS
Even if it was a good car I'd never buy one, just think about the future
Vietnam bombed in the US
Id like you guys to have a collaboration with theautopian!
YeH get a Hyundai they look like spaceship
dont the goverment in the US test the cars before they can be sold ?
$50k is way too much for a new car when you can buy a truck for $22k
Why it looks like a renault ?
Absolutely want a follow up!
“ thank you , we’re sorry “ haha
Yes on update please
They just make benefit from the “Nation pride” of Vietnamese. They r not represent for VN car. But now, they still lie customers using ton of money advertising instead of make a car literally. After all, they just use the Car Brand as a tool to gain the trust from investors, major for real-estate business. So the car?? Well, not a car at all!
Give them another shot. I am a reservation holder of one in Canada 🇨🇦. Hate to pull out of the deal. BTW Alex G had a lot of issues with his ID4 and VW did nothing to help him.
Idk if it s that bad, but the gasoline cars of this company (basically Vietnamese licensed BMW) are pretty good
There is something called owners manual
I am stunned how fast folk buy a car from a new company. I don't buy electronics from a company that have not been doing it for 20 years, a whole car?
Vietnamese cars in the US.. what has this world come to? 😕
You guy are lucky to freely criticized the proud brand of Vietnam. If you try to do the same in Vietnam, be aware of your life, your business.
As a Vietnamese we dont trust this brand ..
This is textbook Minimum Viable Product. Get something out there that technically “works”then have buyers be your beta testers once you have the extra cash from sales.
Please see if it can redeem itself. Would like to see the VF9 too if possible.
I wonder if this will have the worst resale value of all
I'd rather drive a chang li.... or for 50k a fleet of chang li's lol
Great CyberPunk reference! Let's not forget it was trash initially!  Great review, Donut.
Plz stop chewing gum...
Let’s see it!!!!
I don't understand the intrusive lane assist, what if there is an object on the road and you have to quickly change lanes to avoid it? What if the object on the road is a person? The car is like "nah you didn't use your blinker so I will jerk you back into the lane you are trying to leave"
When all reviewers are from BBC
I’ll keep my 1998 Toyota Camry with the 2.2L. It’s 100 degrees today and the AC still works. Why mess with that?
13:12 😮
An update video would be awesome to see
i wouldn’t buy this for 5k
Sounds like it's an experiment
I'm Vietnamese, I've been following you for a long time.  Thank you for a very honest review about VinFast cars, your reviews will make VinFast better and better, I love VinFast because it helps Vietnamese people to easily access electric cars and create many opportunities.  Good job, wish you all the best.  See you again for a review after a year to see if VinFast has changed anything
Vinfast gonna bankruptcy soon for sure 😂
if you posted this video on social media in VietNam, you could get called to the police station. LOL
I feel like a lot of these comments are fake
Do it!! 🙌🏽
vietnam in front of usa in war : 💪🦾🤬🗿🗿   😎🤏  vietnam in front of usa in car: 🤒🤕🥵🥶
Pretty sure Henry Directs porn...
Vinfast will send you to jail for this
Bro sent Vinfast back to Vietnam with ME.
0:37 Hyundai in 1980s, they were terrible cars. But they were really cheap. Very cheap. But this vinfast is so expensive. Who wants to buy Vietnamese car? 😂 for $50,000??
Thumbs up for follow up drive.
look like they didn't test the car before selling
Evs are trash
Mpk
It’s funny I drove a polestar the other day and had most of the same issues
this is actually a Chinese car being rebadged.
What you guys need to do a vid on as its Very Important Saab Neves Emily GT EV what you find is  1 this was thought of by Mr Porsche Before he made a car company (begs question why Todays Porsche Not go down this road ). That it Works and makes the EV more desirable than the EV we been offered today primarily coz cars have 600 mile plus range and done look wired etc. check it out .  My theory why industry not do this is coz they want make more money and related companies too . As the System is actually more environmentally friendly as you Not been needing use electricity every 200-300 miles in recharging plus the cost and materials needed . As said check it out be interested in your thoughts on it .
With $50k in my country, i can buy a Toyota Hilux GR (highest spec) for $30k and go home with $20k in my pocket or buy a house in a medium density suburb for $45k and buy a second-hand toyota corolla altis for $4k and go home with 1k in my pocket lol, $50k for newly invented car nooooo
Tôi yêu cái cách bấm giờ cho đến khi khởi động được chiếc xe . Nó đang chứng minh bạn từ một kẻ ngáo ngơ đến một người thông minh là thế nào. Bạn rất thông minh.

Sorry to be a pedant, but if you start in reverse and finish going forwards then it's a four-point turn.   You're welcome.
Cyberpunk wasnt even rushed. They worked on it for like 9 years and it was still trash on launch
Looks nice though. Just started the video.
Car industry has deteriorated significantly ever since the focus shifted from hardware to software
So, you can make a luxurious living by jumping 10x a day on the non working accelerator pedal...😁
better car than teslas tbh
Damn, the amount of vf8 shills in here are astounding. It's a bad EV as it sits, that was rushed to production at an unreasonable price point. Vinfast might make good vehicles. But the vf8 isn't one of them yet
I remember when I hired a Audi and it took me over an hour to work out how to start it and only achieved it after several reps from the hire company tried and failed also.
A new car brand but their customers service is greatly beyond my expectation.
Ain't looking for no golf cart.
EVs are not the future. Combustion engines & algae fuel is the future of cars. EVs are just china's get rich scam along with solar panels. EVs are also an easy way of controlling the population through electricity. It's never going to work. Once we get rid of this corrupt tyrant government we can get back to normal.
Ford came out with the ford pinto.And no one blinked an eye. Hmm🤔
who else wants to see this on regular car reviews? it might even be a candidate for race to the bottom.
I had rented a bmw X7 & it did the same crap if you changed lanes with no blinker it would snatch the car back into the original lane. I could just imagine someone stopping in front of you so you change lanes without the blinker & then the truck snatches you back & you rearend the car you were passing
If only they'd given the car a proper amount of shake down time, it could/would have been far more impressive. I genuinely hope that Vinfast improves.
Just make it work like a normal car! Best point made. Yeah I want a new Tesla but I don't have a 12yr old to teach me how to operate the damn thing. I'm 34 and I've been driving half my life, I shouldn't need an adolescent copilot! 🤷🤦✊🤘👍
Definitely do a follow up with Vinfast!
If you do another video on VF you need to have the car for at least a week to see what will happen..
Not even Vietnamese buy this shite. Vinshit is a money laundering exercise
For your info in Vietnam they still have those issue...alot of owner in Vietnam complaining all the issue over the VF forum..
Not only Tom Peng have that issue.   In Vietnam 9 out of 10 car sold within one week they all have electric failure..
Cars that don’t start or drive because you don’t have the seat belts on is so fuqen retarded because imagine if you’re being chased you hop in your car trying to get away the last thing you would think about it putting your seatbelt on!
Can't switch lanes without blinking?  A wild animal appears. Me: tries to dodge it. Vinfast: No
Imagine you have got a bad social credit score because you didn't want to be a guinea pig for big p,harma and your car won't start . No apologies ever G,ates  🖕 💉 💔 🤕☠️
After living in SE Asia for 15 years, there fewer things in the world I'd want to spend my money on than a Viet built car...  Even in Vietnam, a strong selling point of cars is that it is imported from outside Vietnam even if the same model can be bought cheaper but built in Vietnam.  Viet motorbikes, scooters, and cars just suck so much in comparison to other countries vehicles.
Lesson learned, don't trust anyone, just test drive it and experience it yourself
The new Kia Sportage phev has a laggy/delayed gas response which is really bizarre. I tried one out on a snowy day and it didn't react at all on fast pumps on the pedal, and it would give full throttle half a second after you let go of the pedal. Really wierd and almost impossible to slide around with controllably, though that might not be it's intended use...
Vinfast: I'm gonna pay you 100$ to f**k off
ok I'm Vietnamese and French so My view is a bit biased but some journalists are being too harsh on this new product lol
When people say "there are no bad cars anymore" 😂
How do fix a suspension issue with an update?
They eat dogs in vietnam.
If we’re comparing this car to the gaming world, compare it to the launch Xbox 360 because this is almost exactly what Microsoft did back in 2005
First impressions are everything...people can, and will, turn their back on you forever based on a lousy first impression that leaves them feeling scammed or ripped off.  Rushing into market without ironing out these issues is dumb, cars aren't videogames, and drivers aren't as stupidly tolerant of issues like this as gamers can be.  They should've taken the time, tested this crap properly, and then released.  I admire their commitment to compensating for issues and the constant updates but it's better to have taken the time to minimise the need for them.
You guys gonna be sued by Vinfast, Vinfast has the traditional of sueing their customers
it's just me or it looks like a Renault with another badge?
That accelerator pedal delay is intentional to make the ride smoother. It's not a sports car, it's a passenger car. All Volkswagens, Opels, etc classic cars behave exactly like that, so i report this as misinformation and thumbs down. Shame on you.
Thank you, we're sorry too.
To be fair, I haven't used lane assist that I actually liked. It always feel like I don't have control of the car.
This is the Renault Megane E-Tech in Europe.
❤❤❤
If at 2 mins 20 seconds you aint being transported to Bancho Sushi... then i dunno
It looked like a renault
The fact is that when you still want to change lanes and do not turn signals (in case of an emergency such as dodging a deer or an accident), it can still be done normally, just steer clear, there will be a slight vibration in the car. steering wheel, and that's all that happens. Nothing is too difficult
Was this video paid by Vinfast?  Many of the things on that list are things that might not occur directly, you would likely have to live with it for a bit to see/experience some of them.
So, if they already did the updates to fix a lot of those bugs and it's done "over the air" then shouldn't the car you drove already have had them as well??? Js.....
thats why we have vehicle regulations folks  thats why you pay taxes  thats why you should vote liberal democrat.  because if you dont for long enough  the republicans will have enough power to abolish all the regulations that keep you safe so ford and gm can hoard more money  but hey keep blaming trans people for your welfare red state going to sh!t  im sure theyll be the reason your 2027 ford escort will be a cheaply made $100k+ deathtrap after you vote for the deregulators again and you get red misted on the highway, too...   🙄🙄🙄
For 50k not one of those issues should be a thing. Smells like a scam to me.
I think cars from the Tesla brand start the same - I would also mention Tesla under competitors. They are an electric car Manufacturer.
This is pretty simple. Evs are hot garbage.
Pls pls I am telling you, you will love a Mahindra. It's just an amazing car manufacturer they make the best jeeps your gonna use
Thanks for the honest review. Hope VinFast can fix all the problem it the future.
Sorry guys, but Henry needs to chill. He’s acting like he’s Aston Kutcher on punk’d
Hey guys. What happened to the money pit civic?
I hate new electric smart cars. Undrivable. Just make it electric, don't need to make it bad.
Yeah, the electric vehicle con vehicle I tested had no quirks and was a smooth quiet ride. The features were on the simple side but some people don’t like all the tech stuff. The notifications can be desensitized and customized. This was probably the updated version.
It has turbo lag. Cool.
Vinfast: that very good, good material & service, but it just sell california only
I actually like the sound of the saps program. I think most new vehicles should have them tied into the warranty period  (Proceeds to never own a sub 15yr old car)
Everything you need to know to get up to speed on the VinFast V. F. Eiiiiggght
Part of my issues with EV's is that manufacturers seem to feel they need to throw huge amounts of (often annoying) tech at them, resulting in them being ridiculously expensive when compared to other more conventional vehicles. I for one certainly don't have 50+K to spend on a new car, so for me the only option would be to lease, and I suspect that the way things are going, in 10 years time that will be the new normal for the vast majority of us. What I would like to see is an EV for the people - an electric car that is just... a car. A car that isn't festooned with cameras, gigantic touchscreens, comes with its own app and silly door handles that slide out when you unlock the vehicle. A car that will have a reasonable range, and just have the means to hook up Apple CarPlay or Android Auto and just gets you from A to B without it being an utterly miserable experience - the end. That's no too much to ask, right?
"If you don't have your blinker on, you can't switch lanes." BMW drivers need that "technology". LMAO, 7:57 - 8:30 felt like a Larry David script. You need to curb your enthusiasms, dudes.
I turn off lane assist anyway. I hate it when the car fights me on where I want to go when it thinks I'm drifting out of a lane.
yep, thank you for making this video, as a Vietnamese, I do hope Vinfast can fix their car and sell it all over the world
Try Try Try again. Time will tell.
i can hear so much bass noise…. remove mic from the car….
You would have to be a f-ing idiot to buy from a company like this, in the first place. 5 years from start-up to production... during covid? No thanks
Of course what do you Chinese made car!
It looks like Vinfast's main problem is they have tried to go premium too soon.  They need to learn from Hyundai and start with good value cars that get better over time.  Premium buyers do not tolerate poor quality - build or otherwise.   If they can make a cheap EV that wins on price not luxury - people will fall in love with them.  Target the compact market then build from there.  Gotta walk before you run.  Onwards and upwards.
Even though it’s so easy to steal, no one will steal it cause it’s a piece of s@&t car
When you need a stopwatch to see how long it takes for someone to just Start the car, we have a serious problem. What's wrong with a key that you turn inside a lock?!
Tôi là người Việt Nam và hiện sống tại Việt Nam, thực sự bạn mua chiếc xe 50k USD còn rẻ chán so với việc mua nó ở trong nước ( nơi lăp ráp chiếc xe và được ưu đãi nhiều về thuê- nghe hài hước nhỉ) bạn có quyền phàn nàn nhưng ở trong nước ai mà phàn nàn về chất lượng chiếc xe thì có cơ hội cao "được" mời lên đồn công an "uống nước", bản thân tôi thấy chất lượng nó tệ thật nhưng tập đoàn này nổi tiếng ở Việt Nam chỉ về mảng bất động sản (nghe nói có liên hệ với 'cong san') còn những mảng còn lại thì không ra gì cả. Xin lỗi bạn chiếc xe này tạo ra bởi 1 nhóm "cơ hội" thôi chứ người Việt Nam tôi làm việc gì thì cũng muốn làm tốt và chỉnh chu bạn nhé :D
Not worth even 20K.
mấy thằng vin nô vô mà coi nè,xe lổi quá trời,mà đòi đánh bại tesla :))
The UI looks like an almost identical copy of Tesla's 😂
Unique Case
The car and the name just give me Chinese knockoff vibes. Like those Amazon companies whose name is just a bunch of letters like “ovvskd”
FOLLOW UP! People let phones force-update and pay outlandish amounts for them: Our cars update now and they're as stupid as fkn phones. Definitely follow-up!🤘😁🤘
The perfect sequel to the Trabant!
This video was edited by Vinfast
What a stupid name. And 50k for that basically untested electric car... nope!
Damn so embarrassing for the Vietnamese
$50,000 way to much for that !
50 grand for this dumpster fire is straight up crime
Okay but, did VINFAST offer you $100?  🤔🤔
This car is junk.  Total garbage.  And it’s interior is worse than Tesla’s underwhelming design, as if that’s even passable.   Obviously this vehicle was rushed into production.  As if we REALLY NEEDED ANOTHER ELECTRIC VEHICLE in a country who’s electric charging network is completely unprepared for the onslaught of electric vehicles.
I feel like Vinfast is DOA in the US. They failed their first impression. It’s not likely they’re going to overcome the image they created.
Another EV maker.... Grrreett 🙄
Yeah no I'll keep driving my 1600$ corolla
why did they remove the sunroof from the board
james grey hair is hot tbh
Wow, and I thought America made the worst cars.
Don’t forget ev cars ar still in baby shoos,
Want to see a update in a year to see how far they have gone with the updates and the persistent issue’s.
You know what is the worst part? Wanting to avoid an accident and LAS taking control of the steering wheel because you didn't use the turn signal... That's a nightmare...
Real Vietnamese really hate vinfast, special  Vietnamese American. Because those vinfast's cars sold in the USA are an instrument of propaganda from Vietnam goverment.
just launched few months but dozen journalist already give bad reviews (??)  That's suspiciously like smear campaign 🤔   yeah, some issues aren't true    but is it still worth spend 50k (??)
this car simply has "drive AIDS"  what would you expect of a car that has AIDS
In Vietnam there was a youtuber sued by Vinfast because he made a video reviewing to his Vinfast car, he had to takedown his video afterward. As a Vietnamese I would never get a Vinfast.
Honestly, I don't have $50K + Taxes, fees, insane Dealer mark-ups to drop on a new vehicle. But if I did, I sure as heck wouldn't buy something from a brand that has only existed since 2017. I'm buying a brand new Toyota Highlander LE for that money, instead.
Whistlin Diesel should buy one
Hahhaha those chimes horrible and all assistance tech in all cars should just be removed in general or at least not default to on.
eh
This car is a bullsh*t.
Get the Jinma J2 and push it to the limits during a review.
Cyberpunk took years to develop and still needed more time 😂
My 64 chev shuts off when I’m driving
Lmao $50K??? Are they insane?
Was that a hair reveal!? I never seen him with a hat off.
I Feel Like This Guy Shouldn’t Be Driving While High on Drugs….
This comment section gonna look like a jungle in Vietnam real soon :
It’s like a paid closed beta, but for cars
Vinfast are doing what Star Citizen devs do lol
My god what a horrible product
it thought it was vin diesel's
This is why Vinfast shouldn't have sold up their Australian development facilities and fired their Australian engineers. They could have done with a bunch of ex-GM employees to help get their vehicle engineered properly.
you should give it another shot
BRO IM RETURNING TO FORZA AND I SEE HIGH LOW SERIES OF 350Z
This entire thing sounds like a rich guy decided he wants to make cars and licensed / bought a bunch of tech and rush through everything and keep throwing money at it until it succeed. Vietnam is not an industrialized nation and was never historically known for their engineering ingenuity unlike the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean so not sure why people would pay $50000 for Vinfast
That start up is similar to the e-Golf. Foot on brake and d. Left me stranded in confusion for several minutes.
Definitely give it another drive
Another shot
Honestly the car seems probably just as bad as any modern VW (Golf 8 Gen) group car with their constant shutdowns of their Infortainment and their dangerous and most of the time also broken drive aids
Nolan wearing that GOATed Coffin Flop sweater.
The fact that a company like this is willing to cash people out on even the most minor of inconveniences shows how much they want to improve. Any other brand would just spit on you for calling their customer service.
Tesla building cars without brake pads and other features ....
Too bad James is in this video =\ he needs too retire .
compensation for inconvenience stuff is literally the "I'm gonna pay you $100 dollars to fuck off"
If this kind of vids make on vietnam, by vietnamese, u get arested. Cool right.
13:18 james really said "you serve ZERO purpose"
Give it a fair shake
thats  2 grand car at most lets be honest
10:50 bro that's just bizarre 😅.   That's a complete misinput 😂
Vinfast be like Ricky: -I'm gonna give you 100 bucks to f* off
Yes do a follow up. Vinfast built its first plant in my state and this is what they are putting out. I even thought about moving out there for work. But now I'm skeptical.
Need to chop some springs bro
So basically a billionaire thought he can make a good car because he has all the money in the world but it turned out to be shit. thats funny.
Best endorsement ever "thank you and we're sorry". 😂
This thing functions just like an Asian driver … don’t come for me I’m not racist, most Asians drive terrible.
I always heard the biggest hurdle to bringing a foreign car into the US is straight emissions and crash safety regulations. I guess if you can satisfy this two, everything else is left to consumer choice.
I work in Vietnam and VinGroup (the parent company of VinFast) took over the island (via questionably legal means) next to where I work to build their car factory.  They forcibly kicked most of the people off the island paying restitution fees vastly below market prices for the land they took from people, and forcing a lot of folks into poverty.  They forced their employees to purchase the first run of VinFast cars (the first few runs were petrol powered and used licensed BMW tech) in order to artificially boost sales figures, as well as gave out cars to nearly all of the top politicians in the area as bribes (Vietnam has an incredibly corrupt political and economic system).  When they shifted over to manufacturing electric vehicles they made a crap product and when a Vietnamese citizen negatively reviewed one they'd purchased with their own money VinFast reported the reviewer to the police for "defaming" the company and reporting “untrue content”,  VinFast and the parent company, VinGroup, are utterly garbage companies and should not be supported in any way.
We need more competition. Lets see if they can fix this thing.
If you dare to speech the truth that Vinfast cars are bad in Vietnam, you'll get arrested.
We want high low drag cars
You can solve the no-turning-without-indicator issue by changing the blinker fluid periodically.
No second chances for any car over $25k!! (nowadays thst includes pretty much any car)
Should of put a Cummins and an Alison in it, would of been mint 👌🏽😂
Imagine having your dog in the front seat and having to buckle their seat just to start the car. The chime is bad enough
So I found a VinFast dealership section at the outdoor mall I stumbled upon while shopping. I just watched this video earlier this morning and didn’t expect to see it in person. Though nice and appealing, I told them about donut media and they knew and were chill about the press it’s getting. Funny coincidence
Dodge Journey is worse
I'll stick with my 60 year old Pontiac, you put the key in the key hole and turn it, it makes a engine noise, nice engine noises, then it goes when you put it in D or R on the transmission gizmo
Nolan took a ride on my disco stick
Also, it's not safe to switch lanes without your indicators because you might hit someone.
I’m from Haiphong Vietnam and this car is embarrassing lol
Here in vietnam, Vinfast still got a bad reputation for being extremely unreliable from their cars and bikes, so even our country understands
Nah, F*** that trash, don’t do another review! Let them pack up their $hit like Fiat and go back where they came from!
Yeah, but even though I eventually enjoyed playing No Man’s Sky and Cyberpunk 2077, I didn’t pay $50,000 for either of them.
$50 K?  Is this a joke?
Do a re-test for sure.
do it
The fact that they took 1 minute 8 seconds to work out how to start the car, even though it is the same(basically) procedure as every other car in Europe.
It’s made for people who literally can’t drive
The battery death is real in vietnam tons of owners having this issue and vinfast taxi evs
The steering wheel's on the wrong side for a start. I love how in an American car review, not being able to escape a murderer is a concern
The annoying chimes for someone in your blind spot, lane assist and vehicle distance are on many vehicles, including my Mazda CX-9.  They're extremely annoying to an analog driver like myself so happily many of them are able to be disabled.. except the trailing distance/ speed reduction while driving in cruise control.  That just let's you adjust the distance 😡
I had issues in my buddies bmws steering fighting me in a roundabout can’t even imagine needing to use to turn Signal to change lanes.
yes please
OMG no hat 13:10
They have customers!?!?!? How is that possible.
Commenting for an update but I’ve literally never seen an update from any channel regarding things like this
Is VinFast about "family"?
Coming to think of it, Hyundai/Kia took more than 30 years to make 'somewhat' affordable and reliable cars and even they are still being laughed at.  Vinfast just needs time to improve their built quality.
Love the analogy with cyber punk and no man sky 😂
Yeah this car seems annoying. I could totally understand why people dont like it. From the beep to the restricted driving (turn signals on to turn) this car is a bit if a disaster.
Part 2 yes
Every single main component in VF8 is made in CHINA, NOT NOT NOT in VietNam. VinFast doesn't know sh*tt how to make a car !!!
So glad I've got my 2020 Tacoma that's going to last me for the next 20+ years and that Toyota does not want to go full electric.
Slap a Tesla logo on that thing and NHTSA will be all over it!
I say give them a fair crack and run the test again.
I very much want updates.  I am very interested in knowing how long a company takes to fix well known issues
is it from Vesla? 🎉
its an electric hamburger !! that alone is a big fail... sorry electric leftist fanboys no sale here!!! thers no V8
The small child runs into the road and you don't signal BAM 1 less  to feed If you can't drive without a nanny computer please don't drive ever.
About 7ish months ago I met a couple guys testing VF8s stuck at a charging hub near Prague cuz one of the cars battery died... They didn't have any good things to say about it either lol
Found yur problem. It's a fuggin commi battery powered pos
Chỉ cần cải thiện một số vấn đề nữa là ok, tesla ngoài vấn đề nói trên chẳng qua chỉ là cái thùng tôn đi động đụng đâu là cháy nổ chết người hai anh vai u thịt bắp mồ hôi dầu
That is in Vietnam
Well Tesla vehicles were not great at reviews at the start, but now is the top sale vehicles in the US, so who knows? Anyway, the start-up secuence could be shown on the display like a lot of cars (press the clutch/brake to start and so on)
In Vietnam, we, if you are judged like this, you can be jailed. Thank you for your honest view of Vinfast.
alot of Vietnamese who bought this vehicle in Vietnam now regret cause this car has so many issues: air conditional, battery life, safety, etc
Did you guys @Donut give Nancy $100 for each day you had the car? 😂😂
Keep lane can be over powered but is most likely designed that small swerves do not make a lane switch. That's the intent of the feature...
I'm gonna wait until they make their next version called VinDiesel
Yess do it another shot :D . . .   and why do james look like that other youtuber who rescues stranded vehicles in the desert?
Drive assist could be minimum ego speed related. It seemed when you got faster it turned on
Give VinFast another shot.  Maybe in some sort of competition with the other lowly ranked cars.  They should be commended for trying - and it’s very early for them.
I'm all for rethinking the way we do things, but the poorly engineered suspension just makes me think they slapped this all on interns.
50k for this? No way
You can't change lanes without signaling??? Cool so if a kid runs into the road I'll just take a second to put my blinker on before swerving to avoid them.  Who came up with this stupid concept and how is it legal in the US?
Vinfast: can they meet the bare minimum at a premium price?  But how would they fix the ride quality with software?
Looks like Hyundai and GM had an ugly child
This the Vietcong car 😂
I think this Vietnamese car should be for Asian roads , cause America has so much comfort and competition  , you can't get a new untested nit smoothed out vehicle there.  And I get Americans want everything best , but Asian market also want that but are more forgiving
BTW,  they invest in PR instead of R&D thus, they cannot fix a lot of problems that have been reporting by customers. I love to buy one but not now unless they fix all these issues.
You bought it on Wish?
Just make a car .... 4 wheels a battery  and a motor .. without the extra weird stuff😅
Stupid car companies make me mad. Car tech is enough as they were up to 2010 max.
Thank you for the very honest review… very lucky for you two still breath the fresh air because most of people like you were arrested and paid a heavy fine after do what you just did in 🇻🇳
It’s like a luxury car in vietnam, in fact it’s one of the best cars I’ve rode in as a taxi while I was there
follow up pls!
Intrusive driver aids are a safety issue. All manufacturers participate in this shit
Love to see a Vietnamese brand on Donut :) the VF8 in fact isn't the flagship car by Vinfast, it's the VF9 which take the spotlight of this brand. It's a full-sized SUV and sadly it's only available in Vietnam. But i hope in the future Vinfast will bring the VF9 model to the U.S so you guys can check it out :)
DO THE FOLLOW UP BRUH
There are quite a lot of known issues over the last two years since they introduce their first ev car ro market and they still unable to fix those problems. That is crazy, they keep chunking out new ev car to the market without testing and fine tuning it and let's the consumer deal with the frustration. Like 12v battery, warning issues, black screen, just name few but even these issuea are widely known and lots of people complaint they still cannot fix it and now the new vf9 just came out with the same issues. This is crazy the way to run their business. Vietnam government do nothing to protect consumer. Basically, if Vinfast dont want to take care then the user will have to swallow the bitter pill.
Dont trust Vietnamese technology 😂
Now do the same test to Hammer Ev. I heard it also trash too
No thanks. I've seen enough. I'm out 50 grand and you want a "do-over"....
Vinfart
Các bản cập nhật được phát hành liên tục, thật là tồi tệ khi lấy một chiếc xe với phiên bản phần mềm cũ để đánh giá rồi nhận xét là chiếc xe tồi tệ và cả hãng xe cũng tồi tệ, thật là phiến diện và áp đặt.
Looks just like that Renault
They would call it the Vietcong
Here for the fair shake.
Thank you for telling the truth. if you are in viet nam and rate vinfast like that you will be fined by the police and forced to remove this review.  and you will also be cursed by the vinfast community
Weird, that's not a Mitsubishi Mirage
Hey Donut, I know you guys wouldn't see this but if you're looking at this, as a Vietnamese, I really suggest you to try the VinFast VF9! It's made after the VF8 so they fixed it! I was on a VF9 last weekend and tbh it's really worth a try! Idk if it's sold in the US yet and idk if there's a difference between both versions but yeah😊
Let's see if after the update please.
i hope u guys can review combustion car lux A and the lux SA
This car is made for those who doesn't obey driving rules...  Stubborn people must have this😂 So then they will turn blinkers on/off at exact same time otherwise they can be RIP😂
I want to see a software update that can change the shock absorbers.
Test other EVs all Hyundai EVs and PHEV lags to protect the motor they say.   Come on guys be fair.  I don’t like this car but lets stop do entertainment and do a fair review
Vehicle updates! Besides software, this car needs a better suspension setup that will require more than a software update.
this abomination is the perfect metaphor for the "NEW WORLD"...
Vf8 is built for performance. Suspension should be firm. Test it with other same class car when you drive fast and make a turn. Man.
Why are you guys laughing at Vinfast's efforts to compensate customers for the inconvenience their car may cause?  Imagine laughing at Tesla for giving you free Uber Vouchers so you can get to places while your Tesla is in the shop.  Seems like an unreasonably biased review.
All lane assist cars does the same thing when you try to change lanes.  Ionic 5, ev6, tesla, EQE. Etc.
Did you read manual instruction before you drive it.
Sorry, not compared to the Model Y???
Every new car chimes for warning… you can turn them off.   Most cars since 2015 chime for safety feature disruption
The most wonderful automotive experience since the Yugo or the Chevrolet Vega.
it was like nobody on the crew was "influencer" enough so they made james change his whole look.
They really just put out a beta test for a car lmao
100% do a follow up. I'd love to see you guys test it out again, given that things like the annoying chimes & a not-so-responsive accelerator could be fixed with an OTA update.
If this was a budget offering, it would have some intrigue to it. Being more expensive than the Ioniq 5 (that is a genuinely awesome car) is egregious.
America getting ready for Vietnam 2.0
The tesla start sequence is not the same?
"Special After Sales Policy" sounds like a "Find the problem and we'll give you a $100" but will never receive it.
So it's basically Tesla of Vietnam
Lets be fair and compare VF8 with the same class car, man.
Honda is better
Vietnamese cars... Lol, Vietnam veterans must be losing it right now.
Made for citidiot suckers with too much disposable income. Like all current EVs, it overpromises and underdelivers.  👎
oh its another lithium mine, earth killing overrated EV? automatic thumbs down from me.
I have driven a VF8, and i feel its SUCKS, although am a Vietnamese, i really like Vinfast for being the first Vietnamese carmaker, because this is our first step into the EV industry, i will takes some risks
The violent shuddering in reverse is probably because the motor phase wires were hooked up incorrectly for reverse
Why is this fisheye camera ?
The Cyberpunk reference made me really nervous that if I drove the car my clothes would disappear. Maybe I should store some spare clothes just in case
The blinker thing to change lanes is what every lane assist car does.  I don't know that I could call this a negative critique of this car.  My Tesla and Volkswagen both do this if I don't shut off the feature.
The accelerator thing, I can do that with a gas vehicle.
😂😂😂
VinFast in the BinFast because it wont last.
Oooopsss olala youtuber name is donut and i just found it now...Donut my fav....a 7 year boy writing❤
Not bad for a car that 6years old. But they can do better with, you can't switch lane if no signal lights on!.
Vinfast is going under
Electric cars are dumb
A lot of preproduction vehicles have these sorts of gremlins and issues.
This car brand got many loyal hardcore fan here in Vietnam lol
Kinda sounds like Tesla when they first started building cars. Except they were $100k instead of $50k.
Gotta say, this is the reason why I don't sub. Because the only car company in the entire world to openly admit that the car might not be perfect but will actually financially assist you on top of repairing the car, and you guy pay out on ém, I'm no fan of this brand at all but to have some normal logical terms in a contract is something we should be embracing. Either that or when your Ford stuff's up and you want compensation, you have to fight them to get any outcome, most time going to a government body to rule over it, taking time and more money... Yeah, you boys are way off the mark with this
Still considering this car so that I can report type 3 issues and make bank. Only need 50 days at the shop to make my money back
By 2023 standards this car is a joke
My question is who bought this car without test driving it first? These issues with ride quality, chimes, and acceleration seem very apparent and very egregious. How would you not notice and purchase the car??
Weird startup sequences are an inconvenience for short term reviewers. An owner will get used to it pretty quickly. Not a faff tbh. That said, having a start/stop button wouldn’t hurt.   But the indicator situation/driver aids look dismally poor, as does the ride quality. No arguments there.
Fuck these high tech modern cars so much shit to break. Give me a 90s car.
Yes I’d love to watch a follow up
Vinfast II. Yes.
I like the dollar compensation scheme. They think customer can be shut up with money. This shows the company fundamental principle.
Yo, but forreal, fuck Corncob TV. Only the real ones remember Coffin Flop!. 10/10 sweater, Nolan.
0:52 DRIVE "AIDS" is right
Tens of thousands of VinFast EVs including VinFast electric motorbikes, e34, VF8, VF9, and VinBus known as VinFast fully electric public buses carrying 50-60 passengers at a time, have been manufactured and currently on the road safely in Vietnam since 2018, when the first electric motorbike - Klara was introduced. Most importantly, hundreds of units of VinBus-electric public buses have been providing service between the cities, every day from morning to night - from 5:00 to 21:00, 7 days a week transporting about 300,000 passengers daily in Vietnam since December 2022, and so far, not a single unit of VinBus catching fire or exploding or losing control resulting in any death, has been reported! In addition, thousands of units of Vinfast e34 as electric public Taxi cabs have been on the road in Vietnam since 4/2023, and there has been no problem so far. Similarly, thousands of units of VinFast e34 (a smaller version of VF8) and VF8 have been delivered to customers since 10/15/2021, and 9/2022, respectively. All the Vinfast EVs are currently on the road safely without any accidents of catching fire, exploding or losing control in Vietnam since then. This clearly explained the quality and safety standards of Vinfast EVs.
Unnecessary technology is ruining cars, making driving more dangerous, and making us dumb.
My Ford Ranger likes to chime and won’t let you change lanes without the indicator ok, I have these features turned off 😂
If you pay $50k for that you deserve to be bamboozled. 😂
Probably got nausea because the car was made for slow, bumpy southeast asian streets.
Do a follow up, but do it alongside Natalie's after she updates too. I think they're full of shit, so the comparison would be nice.
Give them another chance by doing the same review on the car after the update.
Cars are becoming more and more electronly made like driving a smart phone  which really gets away from your driving experience unless you like to many bells and whistles
You ended the video without telling us how you turn the car off
Here in Vietnam, seeders praise this car with words like "Top-notch" or "Peak product". And what pisses me of the most is the fact that there are so many of these MFs around, doing the work for free. They even attach loving Vinfast to patriotism: If you don't love Vinfast Unconditionally, you're a fucking treason! I get it a new product/brand will need to learn a lot to improve. But the key to that lies the user/supporter community, which Vinfast doesn't have. So when Vietnamese recognize the harsh truth that making a car does not get them to the top of the world, and there are a lot more to be done, Vinfast may have a chance. Until then, it's just a waste of everyone's time and money.
This is why I’m really against going 100% ev. Tech companies aren’t known for making sure everything is thoroughly tested before we listen to the audience in recent years Tesla, Rivian, Apple and video game publishers testament to that. The over reliance on technology makes people get lazier and dumber. I feel just because now you don’t have to worry about oil, change and transmission changes and a lot of other maintenance. People slack off even further such as the full autonomous driving features in a lot of new cars. Also, these heavier vehicles will just exacerbate the MAIN reason for going all electric, emissions. It’s going to take DECADES to have a pure green grid so all the pollution we “save” from not driving ice cars moves offshore to mining and refining the raw materials needed to make the batteries, power the grid to recharge the batteries, power the plants and equipment need to service the roads for the EVs because of the added weight wearing down the road more than usual which means MORE materials needed for construction of new infrastructure. All of this just so we don’t have to worry about emissions from vehicles which isn’t touching the real source of the problem of green house gas emissions.
At this price point it seems UNREASONABLE to purchase an unproven platform such as a Vinfast..
Vinfast is Italian styled and German BMW based. There have been about 850 units of VF8 sold in the US and Canada, and 373 of them were delivered to customers in last June/2023 alone, which accounted for almost 50% (44% to be exact) of the total sale of VF8 in the US and Canada.
Give us a HiLow Tacoma stocky 🙏🏻
You should start a new series called what not to buy
IMO, Kia is the last company that has come up and is starting to be accepted  as a legit car company. That took roughly 12+ years. The company before that was Hyundai, Kia's parent company. Neither of them charged 50k during the first decade.
we need owner perspective, she has been driving this car for longer period of time
The whole start up is based on how long it takes to know how to start it, it took you guys almost a minute.
OMG What James is saying at 12:50 I couldn't agree more. I get it, EV/Hybrids are like statement pieces to these manufactures but you don't have to make them so damn different. Just make a damn car that drives. The CyberTruck for example, yeah it looks cool but I don't want to drive that ugly ass thing. Stop making them look like EVs and just make cars that work.
>Nearly gets in a fatal wreck. Nolan: DO IT AGAIN ! ! !
cant be as bad as an early 2000s chrysler sebring convertible. nothing is. literal cancer isnt as bad as the sebring.
Ford Transit blinkers are actually like people claimed the VF8 ones are, I fucking hate Transit blinkers
I just wanted to say that If this car had used a DIESEL engine, it would've been called VinDiesel ill see myself out
Despite a career in tech and an interest in fancy new toys, I learned long ago to not pay to be an early adopter. Let other people suffer the bugs
Yes, update / follow-up PLEASE! Thanks fellas.
They brought the video game business model to car manufacturing. Terrifying.
This companies a joke 😂😂 I walked into a store in L.A that had 3 in the store with windows down and didn’t even get a hint of leather smell from their so called leather seats.
An EV with unresponsive acceleration is just unacceptable. The zippy acceleration is the best part of driving an electric vehicle!
makng cars for over 100 years.....yet yall made the tesla which no one cant drive well enough to NOT wreck
Passed one on I5 South to San Diego going slow in the left lane with manufacturer plates. Now I understand they must have been scared to drive faster or change lanes...
If old people try turning this car on.. Its a real problem. It should be on red. Already acting like grandpa would be able to figure out how to turn this car on asap on first try. FYI some 75 year old guy got stuck in his Cadillac XLR and almost died in it until someone came rolled by and open the door for him. He did not how to manually open the car door after the battery died and he didnt have his cell phone on him. People gotta remember old and technology dont not mix well sometimes.
they were too focused on making it safe, they sucked out the life out of the car itself. OR... they may have developed it specifically for old people
Horrible review. You already set yourself up with your attitude at its failure. How many cars when new have some issues? The acceleration issue was weird but the ID.4 also has a gradual acceleration. Also when it was released its software also had many issues. Did you bash them? No.
Who in their right mind would buy that thing got 50k?
I don't think you can software update shitty suspension.
Great another communist car. The last one here did so well lol.
If you want something that’ll just turn off while driving buy any first gen Durango over 180k miles
fools...
That cash for an issue is a joke
Some good chassis tuning with new shocks from a reputable company, a few software patches and this car should be fine!
No Man's Sky was released from a studio with 6 people working on the game (now 37). Not really a fair comparison  to cyberpunk or this junk car.
It’s Vietnamese lmao say no more
Oh god...chime chime chime chime chime chime chime chime..😂😂 the problem is you can't turn them off. It goes back to default every time the car started.
The accelerator will feel normal to those of us who grew up with '80s turbo lag.
Typical Ornamental 3rd world shit car. All they can do is try to copy, and not well. China etc  go home
You cant move lanes without an indicator on, this vehicle is perfect for bmw drivers to learn!
E
When Vinfast launched in America and I saw it in a mall showroom I knew 😂 no offense but Vietnam isn’t necessarily known for its auto manufacturing 💀💀
They just opened big manufacturing facilities in the Carolinas. Makes me worried for all those jobs, if these vehicles don’t take off in the USA like they’re planning.
Deserves to be rereviewed
it just feels way to cheap and uninspired ima keep my 240
Great video
Aside for the suspension,, most premium car have these features.. People that complained couldn't afford those cars and surprised when they got this car
Do a 6 month follow up.
NMS is lit.
Why'd the board switch from sunroof to driver aid
So basically your saying that for $50,000 you get an ugly covered go cart....
As someone that works for a manufacturer, those promises of money are a death sentence. VinFast won't be around for long doing that. Even if its a small percentage of the vehicles experiencing issues that will be a LOT of money.
Yeah, if this car was 20k cheaper I'd possibly give these issues a pass... Maybe closer to 30k cheaper.  When you're paying 50k for a POS like this, it makes you wonder is it just much higher because its an import?   When I look up the Vietnamese site it sells for 1.090.000.000₫ (A BILLION DOLLARS!?!) which is like 10k USD.
Theback look like honda H-RV
YAS to the follow up
Surprised the Mitsubishi Mirage wasn’t the worst 😂😂 however this seems pretty bad too
We want a video on the updated vinfast
The last point at 12:52 is extremely true. Just take the engine out and replace it with an electric motor. THAT'S IT. Give it a few cosmetic flairs but remember that it's still a CAR.  But no, today's ADHD crowd must have moronic acceleration figures and features that keep breaking just so they can prove it's "better" than internal combustion. Rabid EV fans are ruining EVs.
Had not heard of this car/company until this video popped up in youtube.
13:11 OMG, I've never seen him without  his hat on... he looks like an old version of the kid on the 6th Sense mooovie...
I'm vietnamese myself so it's quite nice to see this kind of content. Even in Vietnam VinFast is still trying to improve. I mean VinGroup is a huge coglermate so obviously it won't be good at the first start. Heck they had to sell some of their stuff like adayroi and VinMart for this. Just give it some time. They're only just newcomers.
Apart from the price I think this car is ok. All of the problems mentioned are minor and most EVs have those problems.
An acurate representation of my first time trying to start a Tesla 😂
this company is a SCAM, dont be an idiot and give them your money.
Im so annoyed with electric cars trying to reinvent the wheel. Some cars even make the glove box open with the infotainment system
Yes, please follow up. This makes me feel that government regulations should be improved. No car should make it on the road with such glaring safety issues.
Just disable the warning ⚠️ alarms
Remember the KIA introduction? Talk about crap cars. Now look at them. Actual contenders.
good job
the car is about 35k too expensive I get that its a new car and SUV but you cant make a first car as a company with that many issues and price it that high you can buy great japanese or german cars for that price
What the hell is wrong with you idiots buying that shit
That's pretty cool if they keep to those type things though
Did the owner of VinFast claim there exists only two genders, or support RFK Junior, perhaps criticize the Ukraine war, or something?
But cars aren't games. You can't restart So these safety issues should not be acceptable on launch
I would not be willing to pay $50k for a car from an unproven brand when there are plenty of other very nice home grown (or even foreign) options. If it were cheaper, it would be a contender. Kind of like how Kia and Hyundai, or even Honda, Toyota, etc got their feet in the door in the US. Nothing wrong with being from Vietnam at all, they just need to price themselves at a point where people would be willing to take a chance vs the other options from established brands.
If the car is fixed, can you please make a video about it? I dont want to see the only car company in my country (Vietnam) be shamed
Problem its an electric !
Yes, do another review. I would like to see if they fixed what they claimed they did.
Please do another review, I'm curious to see if the updates "fixed" the car.
I MISS THE OLD DONUT
I'd say that's a car that should be scrapped after the warranty expires
you guys are garbage at normalizing your audio before you put out videos. this fr keeps me from watching them sometimes. i am not screwing with my eq so your vids sounds mildly more acceptable.
Laughs in having a car from 97
"Just make a car that's electric. Don't make it all weird!" 100%, wish that was a thing from any company.
i like the idea of automakers that we don't get coming over, but at least try and make it good LOL
The first question he asked is how to start this car! He then said, "We have been making cars for over 100 years!" This just showed how clueless he is. Yes, we Americans have been making cars for over 100 years, but they are ICE cars, NOT electric ones! Electric vehicles are totally different from ICE vehicles. The drivetrain of an ICE vehicle contains up 2,500 moving parts, while the drivetrain of an electric vehicle contains only 20 moving parts. Electric motors are typically powered by two moving parts and are driven by single-speed “transmissions” without gears. This is why many traditional ICE car manufacturers including Toyota are facing many tough challenges including new technology when transitioning from making ICE vehicles to electric ones. Obviously, Vinfast is not perfect, neither is Tesla, and Tesla has been making EV for over 15 years!
Vinfast is not a good EV? Think again. Tesla as the leading EV maker in the world has been making EVs for over 15 years, but Tesla cars are not immune from serious problems. According to Forbes, over 4 million (81% of 5,093,690) Tesla cars had been recalled since January 2022, which meant 4 out of 5 cars Tesla made, had certain problems from breaking and seat belt flaws to battery and software issues. Also, the Washington Post on 06/12/2023 reported, there have been 736 Tesla crashes as a result of Tesla Autopilot since 2019 when it first started - average 147 tesla crashes per year or 3 Tesla crashes per week! It's shocking, isn't it? That's not it; over 3 weeks ago on 6/11/2023, a footage of Tesla "phantom break" causing 8-car crash pileup emerged. Tesla Autopilot Full Self-Driving (FSD) caused a Tesla to suddenly stop for no apparent reason, in the middle of a lane under the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Sadly, Tesla has publicly put the blame on the driver for using Tesla "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) mode because it's NOT actually full self-driving despite its name. Duh! According to Kron4 report on 6/14/2023, a white Tesla was fully engulfed in flames after a single-vehicle collision. The vehicle appeared completely destroyed after the flames were extinguished. A 44-year-old mother and her 13-year-old daughter were killed in a fiery crash when their white Tesla hit a tree. The husband, who was not in the car said, "Whatever comes out of all this about how they ended up where they did, it shouldn’t have exploded, caught fire whatever you want call it, so quickly that they couldn’t get out." Women in general tend to drive more carefully, especially when driving with their children in their vehicles, which explained why women often pay less for car insurance than men. The cause of this Tesla crash killing the 44-year-old mother and her 13-year-old daughter, remains a mystery. Tesla cars are not perfect despite the fact that Tesla has been making EVs for over 15 years! No EVs are perfect, but the ones with fewer serious problems are better. It's your choice. Sandy Munro said in one of his Vinfast videos, VF8 was not a speed demon car like Tesla, but at the end of the day people would be happy with what VF8 offered.
PLEASE make an up to speed video on the cozy coupe
Did the owner of VinFast claim there exists only two genders, or something?
Where can i purchase the mini cars ?
The name says it all lol 😂😂 what is it with Asians and names for cars.
Turn the safety features off it's a proximity warning
And you can shut off all those times that's a safety warning system
I like the videogame comparison you used, but when you spend 50 grand on a car, waiting for the manufacturer to iron out the bugs is out of the question.
Viet here we're new to this please go easy on us
It’s hilarious how bad this car actually is
Buy a Vinfast, you'll be Vinfurious.  I'll see myself out.
more vids with nolan n James lol
STOP BUYING GARBAGE SHIT
The key word "Eligible" customers
I honestly think that they have potential id absolutely love a follow up same car but with the software updates so we can’t have bias.
Why in the world would any American buy this vehicle for $50k???
I hope this company implodes, and I pray that every electric car falls apart in the next few years. I hope we can wake up from this nightmare.
8:00 minutes in a Tesla cruises by lol beep beep
Me a Vietnamese:Khôngggggggg,tại sao vậy??
Update and test again! It would be fair
1 more time in 1 year update
Definitely give them a second chance to prove themselves. Everyone deserves a second chance.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH ROLLING TEST, It was never checked. I makes me ansious

hahaha! i trust you guys better than famous car reviewers! you nailed it! 🤸🤸🤸
It just looks like a Dacia duster without the build quality of a Dacia duster. And when you think Dacia, you don’t think “build quality”
Lol, this thing is like learning to drive with an over anxious parent. Constantly nagging you, turning the wheel while you're driving and making you wait forever just to turn on the car. 😂
My biggest concern is the acceleration 😂
well fuck me, they made kia sportage electric
I think they deserve another opportunity .... like No Man's Sky or Cyberpunk 2077
Like the cov jabs.
It’s at 13:12 that this video gets really interesting. All that hair!
bring back up to speed
just the name "vin fast" just sounds stupid...
The first question he asked is how to start this car! He then said, "We have been making cars for over 100 years!" This just showed how clueless he is. Yes, we Americans have been making cars for over 100 years, but they are ICE cars, NOT electric ones! Electric vehicles are totally different from ICE vehicles. The drivetrain of an ICE vehicle contains up 2,500 moving parts, while the drivetrain of an electric vehicle contains only 20 moving parts. Electric motors are typically powered by two moving parts and are driven by single-speed “transmissions” without gears. This is why many traditional ICE car manufacturers including Toyota are facing many tough challenges including new technology when transitioning from making ICE vehicles to electric ones. Obviously, Vinfast is not perfect, neither is Tesla, and Tesla has been making EV for over 15 years!
Hãy đến thử xe, nghe ba lời vớ vẩn cũng tin
Vinfast is not a fledgling company. Its part of vingroup, the biggest company in Vietnam.
Không thấy Bò đỏ vô phản biện vậy
Good Lord I fkn died at James "This is the worst car to escape a murder in", "How do you start it?!" Sound effects and all, this is why I love ya'll.
It's all fake, see how they collect bad information about vinfast very deliberately. That is unfair and heartless.
No point testing this again lol
Designed by the NVA?
It might be awful, but competition is a good thing. I’m glad they are at least trying.
this clip is very bad. It's not useful
My 2023 Acura wont turn on blind spot detectors until im going 20 mph. in traffic its scary when wanting to change lanes.. I bet that's why they wouldn't come on till you reached a certain speed.
I really hope they manage to turn it around. It would be nice to have another competitor in the car industry
Fun Fact: James was in a Key and Peel sketch
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. the audacity. no mans sky never deserved that kind of shade, shame on you jimathy
my volvo is more complicated to start.
Seems like I need to buy one of these cars.. it'll pay for itself with all the payouts I'll receive 😂
They’re fixes are not reliable.  The same people doing that fix did the initial programming.  Garbage in, garbage out   And the video game reference is idiotic… the “unfinished” game didn’t cost me my life, for 714x  the price of a game
Vinfast needs to fund r and d.
Bring back the gold teeth, James!
So basically you got the car equivalent of a steam early access game
That super after sales it sound desperate for me, 50K for this brand is a "HELL NO" driving is bad, looks bad, desperate after sales. I rather buy a newer civic or prius 100%!!
Round of applause for billionaire Communists.  They squeeze workers even harder than capitalists.
Honestly the start up sequence is no different from some Tesla Models
Nothing like re-inventing the Yugo and charging premium prices for it.
Could you test Nio EVs with those standards as well😂
Anyone notice how they removed “sunroof” from the original board?
am suspecting that the US is probably being and has been invaded by China before the Chinese army can reach the US because now I am seeing more than 40% of US citizens working. for the Chinese government.
Its insane that they thought these would sell here🤣 theres so many better SUVs for the money.

High low Chevy Silverado prerunners
I don't know why so many white Americans live in the USA but are doing intelligence work for China openly and still have the support of the US people
In all honesty the blinker thing is a good thing. Americans are too uneducated to handle anything that isn't forced upon them. No automatic lights? Driving dark. What's the blue light in my dash? I guess I'll blind everybody, forever. High beams from the back in daylight? Sure. Fog lights? No idea when to turn those on. But make sure the rear fog light is on at the slightest sprinkle while going 80 down the road.  And by how many dead deer are in the middle of the road at all times - nobody seems to be capable of avoiding them anyway 😂 there's also a pedal left from the gas that helps there. It slows the car down, in other cultures that's pressed instead of the horn!
As a vietnamese who have sit in one of these i can comfirm that you have to use the blinker to change lane and sometimes i see one of them overheated and fail also the oversprung is true
If Vinfast cars do not come to the US, Tesla can reduce the price of cars for many US people who can buy Tesla cars at a more reasonable price for US consumers. or TESLA still sells cars at a high price so that Ulon MUSK brings the money of the US people to feed the people of China by keeping the price of Tesla cars at a high price for the US people.
It’s a lemon
So, if you find enough issues, you could almost get a free VinFast.

Ban this car sale in America.If you buy this car and you must buy Life insurance for you and your love one😀😀 It's should be changed the name VINFUCK
Good lord that gas pedal
Def should try and give it another shot. The win-win outcome is either we learn how bad it truly is and get to avoid that as an option for a potential EV, or we learn of a new decent option as VinFast gets both free publicity (again) and they redeem themselves.
I adore my 2010 gas fueled ford focus with zero smart features. My next car will be even older. :)
This is passing beta testing (which is considerable if you do any research on iconic, ground breaking automobiles i.e. Artic conditions, Sahara conditions, ultra humid environments, high speed Autobahn testing, etc.) responsibility to the owner.  Billions of dollars are spent testing various models of major auto manufacturers BEFORE they go on sale and if they fail or don't measure up - they are canceled. Good luck - whiffs of Delorean and Yugos, Pintos and early model Vegas are wafting.......
The only solace I get out of this is that when western  car companies left Russia, these Chinese things filled the void. Bon appetite!!!
You can tell where are the Chinese intelligence guys who are US citizens through the videos of the Vinfast car attackers.
WE’RE SORRY TOO, NATALIE. 😂
I was unable to close the tab until I both subscribed and pressed the like button.... This is the VinFast way. WTF!
I think do another video towards the end of the year to ensure that at least the major kinks are worked out.
Fighting words from a group who can't spell check Volkswagen. Nicely done.
brand reputation is out the window with all these new start ups.
I’m all for Asian Manufacturers. It’s time to end the brutal car prices. Give me something affordable, reliable and safe to get around.   How in the hell is something like a VW Golf starting at 30k? And it’s a base Golf with no options. You’ll be spending like 40k for a well equipped Golf wtf
These problems are all present on my rental BMW 228i right now. Including the terrible driver aids
Sounds like it's got flats on the motorway. An you both looked green 😂
So safe it's dangerous.
The whole car is a beta.
Having driver assistance for me I think is the most dangerous thing. I’m not talking about oncoming traffic back up alarm or crash warning. Physically having something take over control I see being super dangerous. If I’m driving I want complete control lol
No Man's Sky is an awesome game. Now. Hopefully, VinFast can make tbe VF8 great with some updates.
I spent some of my youth bombing the hell out of Vietnam and now i am supposed to buy a car from them…….well i am depressed.
Electric cars are a scam. Don't buy into it. Electric bills will sky rocket, they lose all value after a few years, can't keep them running long even if you perfectly maintain it. Electric cars are like cell phones they will go right in the garbage after the original owner runs it dead. Poor people won't be able to afford to have a car because their won't be manual used cars and fixing the dead Electric cars would cost too much. They are using Electric cars to force mass transit. Their are no positives owning a Electric car.
released too early but i respect it. They will let consumers find their problems for them and they will fix it along the way. My belief is they wanted to situate themselves in the market and get some exposure first, then they'll fix things through out so I do like the approach of tossing money to fix the problem as long as it doesn't lead to any casualties.
Who the Hell would buy this shit from Nam only fools would
*I'd been waiting for VinFast's U.S. debut with high hopes. It's sad to find out they've started out this way. I'm hoping they'll get stuff straightened out, but unfortunately you only get one first impression in life. Bad move, VinFast.*
If you wanna get car sick try being a passenger in a 2005 Hyundai Elantra on the Coquihalla
MKBHD already done a video bout the critical milestones faced by EV makers and where everyone fails is actually bringing a car into production for the market. Monumental that there are people who can buy these.  That said, this thing is a lithium battery dumpster fire.
Hey you didn't address the "rolling" on the list you made
TTW. Turn-Signals Technically Work!
My lead at work has one. It feels better quality than the Tesla I was in.
99% of the experts who rate the worst electric cars in the US are intelligence agents working for the Chinese government. Americans need to consider how many Chinese intelligence agents are carrying US citizenship through Youtube channels attacking Vinfast on social networks.
Most of them journalists probably didn’t get paid and that’s y they had all that negativity towards it
A Tesla starts exactly the same way. Considering that the model Y is now the single most sold car in the world, copying the way the Tesla works seems like a reasonable choice.
You BUY a Vinfast car then become their Beta tester? Getting paid while reporting issues so they can fix it as they find more! Sounds like a ponzi scam. 😅
Review a Banshee next! The 4 wheeler
Why does it just look like a mazda
another shot!
more vf
At least 2 more follow up videos within this year into next year and then go from there 😆 see if they come out with a JDM ev 😂
I might be mistaken but, wasn't Donut called "Donut Media" did they change their YouTube name?
No Man's Sky reference I love this channel so much
I have to agree with James here. Stop making electric cars deliberately weird. The first electric car that is a normal car, powered by batteries, will make someone a trillionaire
Even if VinFast makes the VF8 a great car for the price that can actually compete for that category. You lost me at me mid sized electric SUV. 🤦‍♂️
Track it
Look at this car with terrible reviews.  I’m going to buy one and then leave a review.
Holy crap, I've been watching this channel a long time. James takes his hat off and... is he going gray?   Donut Elder Statesman
If you are tallying votes, I vote tor a follow up!     Since you are now on VinFast radar, I hope you are using that swag to advocate for the person who lent you their personal car to receive some of those stacks of Benjis.
Look how much the camera is jumping even secured to the roof on a mountz
My biggest complaint is that you wrote “volkswagon” 🥺🥺
ADAS operation is good, many people used, don't say disaster like an idiot.
They must have taken the chimes from Subaru
My Volvo 240 Wagon from 1990 is superior to this car in every way hahaha. No annoying "safety features", no stupid tech, and you feel every ounce of the vehicle, and every single move you make. It actually has the acceleration issue going on though, where it is hit or miss if it'll be really lagged in responsiveness, or if it'll suddenly think it has a performance chipped hemi in it and its at the drag strip haha.
Yes, please do the Vinfast update!\
Issues like these, Along with the ugly designs, no sound, no character, no noise, and bo defining features to differentiate cars from one EV maker to another outside of design and like... features (a Chevy has a 454, ford 429, dodge 426 etc ) are why I hate electric cars.
Maybe they should have called the car the Vincrap so people dont waste their money.
I'm ok never having to encounter this mobile trash can again... there are too many legitimate contenders at 50k to waste time with this
Review a car with the worst passenger seat.
Don’t buy cars that are going to be “fixed later”. Assume the fix is vapor ware until it actually arrives, otherwise you could end up with a car that will never be good.
So..... How's the sunroof?
Whatever camera is used at 0:58, please never use it again, it made me feel SICK watching that weird warped perspective. Other than that, amazing vid as usual, liked n shared!
Dudes I love your content, funny and informative, can’t beat it. Never heard of this car or car company before, and my first targeted add after your video was for Vinfast. I guess they truly believe there is no such thing as bad publicity. I was scared for you in that car.
OK IF IT DROPS TO 11,000.oo  I MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT... BUT IT WILL NEED TO EXCEED THE BYD SEAGULL
I want to see it
Although I believe that any new product, be it a car or a can opener, will have unexpected problems, most manufacturers iron this stuff out with testing. I do not care for it when they use the customer for their quality inspections. Moreover, until there is more recharging infrastructure (I live in rural Texas), I will not be buying ANY electric car.
I saw the title and had to watch the video first thing today.  Worth it.  Yeah, I'd vote for a follow-up.  Car builds, fixes, software bug fixes, most recent version of GTA updated on the ECM (ha ha) etc. are what you guys do and one of the reasons I'm here.
If they manage to iron out the bugs in this car then they're reputation will be VinDecated. 😂
communist.
This car is going to set records for Damages paid to deceased owners families!
Du Ma, wha da fck meh
50K for a Vietnamese car?  Seriously?....
Imagine the next apple car being announced and your current apple car stops working properly 💀
some federal oversight group needs to pull these off the road. insane that it was cleared
Thanks.
It's no surprise. I didn't grew up in 1970s to know what American press did the review Japanese cars first exported to the country. But I witnessed and read the review myself of South Korean cars first sold in Canada in 1989. They shared the same negative review from public. I remember the car name was Huyndai Pony. It was laughing stock from Canadians. Well, 20 years later look at Huyndai now. If their cars burn up like Tesla they will be finished in US. I wonder there are no review of Tesla cars burn up from American youtubers. One crucial point that most American youtubers avoid to argue is if they really make the sh*t cars how the hell they have to give 10 year warranty.  Let's wait and see what happens if they can survive in the next 5 years. I think they will.
“Bricked” is a term I hoped would never describe a car but… here we are.
I heard the axel breaks when turning this company is not recommended
Vinfast gave them $100 for the statement at the end of the video lol
On their release, I commented, if they sell what they offered for 25k before the incentive, that might work
But did you also know that majority of the Vinfast cars are not all electric? Some have turbo engines.😊
EV ordered on wish 😂🙈
Good thing donut doesn’t review car’s professionally. Sooo many cars have these almost none issues. This car might not be perfect by any means but it shares many issues that every brand has. Drive any electric car newer than 2021 and you’d be surprised
Start up certainly nothing to be gripping about. If any new person went into a car they’ve never driven of course they’ll be confused how to start ut. Let alone this is an electric car. Totally different set up than a gas powered car. Think tesla, if a person that never drove one went to drive one they’d have no idea how to start it or go. You literally need to be told what to do.
Looks like Vinfast tried to enter the US market Hue too early, and they'll be Saigon before too long.  Much to the Hanoi-ance of the few people who bought them.  I need help
I’m all for software features in cars. But the problem it has led to, is since software can be updated later, they ship it before its ready. Which is concerning for safety related functions. I don’t think that over the air updates should be a thing. If you had to manually do it or take it to a dealer, that would change the urgency.
i'm glad you made the comparison to video games. you can't release a car then have fuckin updates via wifi
Just go buy an ionic 5
Ah yes Vinfast the Vietnamese electric car. LoL even here in Vietnam they fail daily.
reading patch notes for my car
This is EXACTLY the kind of car I do NOT want- I'll take a 20 year old Civic with a 5 speed and 200000 miles on it over this crap any day. At least least it will run right- and it will let ME drive
maybe you're just jealous
Damn I had no idea James had hair :O
A Vietnamese electric car with a name inspired by amazon led bulb brands...
I would like to see the tests, it probably is not enough content for a full video but if you can give us an update
Massive software updates and improvements will solve most of those issues, definitely needs new shocks or springs though
This nonsense is why I go with older, more reliable cars. They just work, even when used quite a bit.
Please do a follow-up. Include tests about regen braking specifically when the brake lights come on. (Brake pedal only vs. High rate of deceleration)
Vinfast? Literally the dumbest name ever 🤦‍♂️
Could y'all work on a 1992 Toyota Celica you never see people recording the modding and they are disappearing around me so I can't do it myself.
Maybe WISH isnt a good place to buy a car😢
I think i just saw James without a hat for the first time?
Love the suction mounted setup on the moon roof. Way cool 😎
I was part of the Vegas test as well, and can confirm the same issues across multiple units.
There’s a little bit of GM DNA in those things. There’s a small JV between the two companies and I believe they are producing in an old GM production plant…. Which is exactly why they F***EN SUCK lololol 🎉
If the updates are OTA, shouldn't the car have had those already? How long did it take Donut to shoot and edit this 15 minute video of a simple drive? I am sceptical about those updates..
A 1 second delay on the acceleration is the SAME as the stupid Jeep Cherokee with start/stop engine feature. So if the accelerator response is considered bad, then why has Jeep ignored the fact that theirs is JUST AS BAD!
They downplay most of them because most of those were said by writers for American companies.  America has always preferred their citizens to buy American made products and keep the money on shore, they will literally say anything to keep Americans buying American made and this is a great example of that 🤷‍♂️
I would like to see an update video in 3 to 6 months, give them time to address problems, and see if they actually commit to fixes, or if it was just short term damage control.
This is a good car.
Ngl I don't much knowledge about cars. But from what I see, it's almost as if their using the customers to beta test their product. Which should've been done before the production of it
Imo looks even nice but...if it have "v8" in name...why its another ev?!?!?! Why our car world goes that wrong way??? im sad now...
I don't believe this car actually exists in the US
So if I'm on the interstate and I need to make an emergency maneuver because, say, someone had an accident that I don't want to be a part of. The car will force me to stay in my lane and have a wreck unless I  single properly before I swerve to avoid a collision?! That's not just a problem. That's a fatality. They're gonna get sued into oblivion if they don't fix that. And FAST.
Dude, give me an electric' 99 OBS with a bluetooth radio.
I live in the mountains of Vietnam.   I see dozens of Vinfast cars every day.    All new.   Most are, stylistically, cheap looking copies of other top selling brands.  And yes, they are more expensive than better cars here too.   I recently bought a new Kia Sonet, and couldn't be happier with it.   It gets 730km to a tank, and gas is cheap here, and the detail and features in it are incredible for $30k.   I didn't even consider Vinfast because of base-price alone.
Had lane keep and lane departure mitigation turned on in my 22 civic. Was diving, when the road widened a bit with a bit of a curve after an intersection, and the lane keep pulled me over to the line, because i technically wasnt in the middle of the lane now, because it was wider. Also had issues when getting on the freeway without my blinker on, it would try to keep me from merging before the line ended. I turned those bastards off.  I want my car to do what I want it to
As a Vietnamese American 🇺🇸 I agree this heap of trash 🚮 is literally a steel coffin ⚰️
Recently got addicted to Donut. I love the humor. I think a video precision measuring tools from wish vs a top brand like Mitutoyo how much of a difference there is.
A car that delivers a constant barrage of alert and warning chimes is a car that drivers are going to very quickly and subconsciously learn to ignore, which significantly increases the likelihood of the driver completely missing a very important chime and suddenly having a Very Bad Day.  Wtf the car won't let you switch lanes without a blinker??? What if you have to take evasive maneuvers in an emergency!? Is the car just going to force you to drive straight into whatever it is you wanted to avoid just because you didn't also use the freaking blinker??????
Electric cars are gay
The best part of the reviews are the Vinfast trolls that mock any negative mention.......of which there's an insane amount...
To be honest  I would not buy or look at one I was charging my bolt when 4 of them showed up for charging  I was surprise how the car looks in real life  I was turn off
"If you don't have your blinker on then you can't switch lanes"   GOOD!  If you don't have your blinker on, you shouldn't be switching lanes...
🚮
You had a chance to through some lightning for lightning fast at 3:06 and I was greatly disappointed 😂
$50,000 for that "electric P.O.S.?  😂
I miss Up To Speed! We need an Up To Speed on some things, dewds, like the VW Buzz!
Why was there a rolling category at the start of the video?  Edit: Also why was there a sunroof category at the start?
For 50k I expect way better
$50,000 for a Vietnamese car that has a 5 year history as a whole.  Even McLaren had a lot of issues with the MP4-12C.  It takes decades to iron out issues.  Hyundai and Kia was a POS when it first came out.  Cooling issues, oil starvation, cheap head and barring stud, plastic timing guides.  I don't expect anything good from this car.  MX-30, Bolt, Kona, etc priced in the $30s.    Got my 2019 Mazda 3 Hatchback AWD for $22,000.  Gas powered. 2.5L i4, 13:1 compression on 87 octane (runs a lot better when I fill up on 93), under $30 to fill it up on 87.  The handling is very good, especially with upgraded P Zero UHP, quiet, sporty feeling, fun to drive, low maintenance, the G vectoring AWD is amazing around corners under acceleration, IIHS Top Pick safety, drop a K&N filter and the induction noise sounds great.  $28,000 price difference, that's 1000 fill ups.  At say 380miles to a tank, that's 380,000 miles I would need to drive to cover the cost difference if I drove this EV.  NO THANKS.  ICE will always be better.
Looking forward to your updates on this vehicle as they improve it or at least make changes.
Treating a car like an early access game is a horrendous precedent.
am i literally the only one who didnt have issues with cyberpunk at launch? didnt get glitches till they started patching stuff
I didnt know third world countries make cars now.
Vietnam is so full of these its scary
Kias were garbage when they first came out too. As long as nobody unalives themselves in a vinfast, they might turn out to have a good product in a few years
Abt the chime,  I test drove a hyundai that I loved, but I refused to get it because of the tone it made when the door was open wirh the engine running
Very entertaining guys!
This car isn’t even priced competitively. Maybe if it were ultra affordable but, who would choose this over a name-brand equivalent?
I bet it has a chime that lets you know it's about to chime.
again
6:01 civic: yo is that donut?
Guys nooo if you review bomb this car then they won’t release their cars in America and we won’t get their cars once they finally get their feet on the ground :( I miss Suzuki
Is it just me or is donut media content getting terrible for the past few months
"just make a car that's electric powered don't make it all weird" couldn't agree more.
i work near a vinfast showroom, and i can probably count with my fingers how many people ive seen walk in there.
Wait..why in the world did you not include Tesla when you listed the competitors?
After researching this company it seems they make all kinds of stuff in Vietnam. I doubt there were any businesses that big in Vietnam that are not directly connected to the Communist Party.
I don't know why they are laughing at the cash offering for reporting failures. I don't know of any car brands that offer such a thing except a loaner vehicle and oil change gift cards. Sometimes warranty extension cash. The brand I work for has us report the failures and then if its something extra special, maybe maybe you get a gift.
Ya, give it another go.  Support the lil' guy!
I am so grateful for this car. The material it provides for this and hopefully future hilarious videos is actually priceless. I can't wait to see what they send us next.
😶‍🌫7:59 "I mean, this is a pretty crumby section of the 405" 🔴This implies that somewhere, the 405 has a good section... please enlighten the rest of us.
Xe Vf8 tại Việt Nam đang bán chạy xe đẹp, an toàn, hiện đại, bền và vô cùng tiết kiệm..chính vì vậy mà nhiều người Việt tin dùng
11:43 asian security mode 💀
I'm amazed that we have reached the point where car manufacturers rush their products out like video game developers, thinking they can just fix it with a patch.
Overall people are whining, complaining,entitle bitches and fuck the internet for giving people a place to express their worthless opinions, and after watching this i laugh...thats what you get for spending 50k on a noname new car company lol hahahaha😂
To make it put your seat belt on to start it is a great idea that all vehicles should be from 2030 on with electrics
Fuck safety, keep that blinker restriction on. If they die they die, atleast they'll remember to use the indicators.
😂
Well all vinfast needs to do to turn the reviews around is starting paying all the media outlets, duh
I'd honestly like to see a follow up. If it's only marginally better, it might say a lot about the company.
i was playing forza horizon 5 AND To FIND OUT my fav youtubers got a event in the game HI. vs. LO congrats boys
People are ripping into this car like it was produced by Ford lol people need to chilllll and let this brand new company work out some of it's kinks. Once they prioritize some things like ride quality I'm sure it'll be a great car company
EV market is just a 10 year fad that will be phased out once synthetic fuels are mainstream. These companies are simply trying to cash in on the hype of other casher-in types such as Elon Musk.
Need to follow the wise words of Dean Winchester. "A car should drive, not be a little bitch"
I CANT BELIEVE IT.  Im Vietnamese but i live in the US and a few weeks ago, I went to a vinfast dealership and I thought it was a cool car.  I did also see a person in my neighborhood own a vinfast VF8.  I kinda found it funny that my mom was right that vinfast is bad or hated
It's a $50,000 car but you can get $30,000 of that back by complaining.
Almost everything is software... I hope they just update it .
get an updated one yeah but maybe give it some more time even for further update
Give them another shot, curious about their update !
All this for the low starting price of 46k
I love the video game comparison!
imagine someone braking in front of you you want to swerve quickly and the car steers you into the other car because you didn't blink
Thats not an suv its a crossover. An SUV is like a tahoe or an expedition.
Fu…..Vu fast is suck
I like seeing this toned-down, more journo-y side of James. Let's have more of that please!
is this the new rover sd1
Holy crap this thing is a death trap.
I'm pretty sure they made the VF8 specifically as revenge for what America did in the 1970s
unexpected honest video game review
Looks like a Renault Megane from the front and a VW Tiguan from behind.
Most likely backed by a Chinese company
That's okay, Americans will make whatever excuse for the car cuz....you know, ally country/vassal state. 🙄
I'm getting crazy Renault vibes from this car. From the looks to the experience
Give them another crack
Hehe Vinfast do suck.  Need to fix lots of stuff.  Or sell it on discount.
the only reason the people are complaining about the startup and drive aid is because the car is teaching the people good habits but the people are too dull mentally to put on their seatbelts and use proper turning signals
You guys should make a gaming channel haha
This is an electric car to choose from
North Americans giving bad reviews of a Vietnamese car. That seems to be expected 😂
Sounds worse that a Chinese made digital copier. Really, really bad software.
I’m sorry but the Vietnamese billionaire behind the Vinfast looks like not to be trusted… like he’s the worst version of Elon Musk as if Musk is not the worst enough with his Tesla…
America just still mad about the Vietnam war
Would have been nice to hear the actual owner's opinion after living with it for a while. I thought for sure we were gonna get a 30 second fast take when they mentioned her.
yes, Do a Vinfast: Part two: Revenge of the updates!
To be honest. It’s actually very challenging to make a bad EV if 90% of your core parts are made in China.
I did a legit doubletake because I have both Cyberpunk 2077 and No Man's Sky on my console and played them both this week.
I'm waiting for the alpha wolf
Yes, it would be nice to see part II. Also, if suspension geometry is ok, changing the stiffness should not be a problem
I think I understand with the chime and driving aids issue. I'm from SE Asia and excluding Singaporean almost every SE Asia country has wild road issue, both with the road itself and the drivers. SE Asia are full of mopeds and small motorcycle and they drive like they own the road, the chimes help warn the car driver about those to help safely avoid them.  The driving aids force the driver to drive more safely, people doesn't turn their blinker on when changing lane here, imagine BMW drivers stereotype, but everyone act like one here no matter what their car is.  The chime is understandable-ish, 50k USD cars are decently expensive for SE Asia market and you don't want to even scratch it. The driving aids are dumb and honestly dangerous. The others problems, yeah.. you can just watch the video.
You can’t change line without the signal is because it’s “keeping lane system”. You can easily turn it off in settings. That’s why there’s a manual. But I guess it’s kinda the employees’ fault for not giving a tutorial to you guys before the delivery.
Unexpected NMS reference. Respect.
"Change lanes" "You didn't say please"
There's 2 editions of this model, a city edition which is the one with most of these probs. And then there's the plus edition which has Ann enhanced battery with  more power, so why not just stick to that model?
If the Mayhem guy was a vehicle
this car should only be sold in china
Legit pretty exciting. New manufacture, ofc not going to be perfect but seems pretty cool regardless.
You're telling me this car has nothing to do with VIN Diesel and FAST and Furious at all?
as a vietnamese person, when i heard vietnam made a car, i knew it would suck lol
VOLUME LEVELS ON THE VIDEO ARE WACK
Vinfast is such a horrible name, and with all the problems I'm surprised anyone with any sense is buying their product.
lane assist and side assist dont normally come on until cruising speed is achieved
You sound surprised that a no name, fly by the night company made a car, they obviously have no idea what they're doing.   It takes YEARS to develop cars and get them reliable.    I am NOT a fan of these fly by night EV makers.   I'm ready for the EV trend to die off... Junk car from a junk company...
Polestar start up is the exact same
Yeah test it again. But don't stomp the accelerator, that gave me anxiety that it was about to launch, all cause you figured out it's konomi code.
That accelerator response is similar to that of the Chrysler Pacifica I rented in LA. The 9 speed auto was garbage and the accelerator would take at least a second before anything happened. Made merging and driving on the freeway diabolical.  Of course the near new minivan then threw a serpentine belt on the way to the airport on the last day, stranding us. The VF8 could be a lot worse!
I‘m glad to live in the EU. Garbage like that car would luckily never be allowed to drive around over here.
So it forces you to drive like a Asian 😂
I have a feeling that this is what happens when you let software developers design a car. I'm surprised there's actually a way to turn it off and no RGB strips.
They just need to get rid of all those unnecessary bells and whistles and concentrate on building a car that you get in and go without it shutting down or not letting you switch lanes without using the turn signal. Then VinFast later can concentrate on making the vehicle quieter and smoother 😊 and then whatever comes next later.
I Vin waiting for a car like you, to come into my life...
You could reward the person who loaned you the car by offering to replace their shocks. You could even get another video out of it.
I've never tried an electric car, but there is a sit down electric forklift truck at my job and it totally has the same lag thing.  But when I slowly press the pedal about halfway, I feel the instant torque like crazy, even with a super heavy load.  And overall, all the controls are so much smoother on propane forklifts.  So I guess this also apply with cars even if big brands probably kind of figured out a way out of it.  But I feel like this is the analog vs digital fight.  A gas car will always have more precise controls.
Buy a Tesla
So, my dad owns an Volvo s90 and I borrowed it. It has line assist. AND IT'S TERRIBLE! It beeps, it makes steeringwheel shake, it throws me aside when there is a "hole" in the lines and it appears again. But the worst part were when i drove it at night, not a single car on the 10+ miles to pointB. I were about to drive onto the highway when the car wouldn't let me on the highway! Didn't matter how hard i tried to turn the steeringwheel, it would not budge! 60 feet away from the barrier i turned on the blinkers and voila, the steeringwheel worked again.. I REALLY don't like "smart" things, they are sooo dumb! Just let me hecking drive my car, I'm a professional driver, i KNOW how to use a car! And all the "assist" crap... Like wtf... All the fucking beeping!! XD
What is this Reverse DLC for a car?
I'd like to see the review redone. I'm also trying to figure out how to fix the suspension with an over-the-air software update. lol.
Soon as they sat in it, well they copy and pasted Tesla that's for sure!
All cars are soon to be more annoying than this.
James 1000% nailed it with the comment of "Just make a car that's electric powered" Literally, just make a damn car where electric motor go brrrrrrrr, we don't need some fancy crap at every turn because the car doesn't have exhaust.
suddenly prius doesnt look that bad
More 50 grand electric junk.........just give me my v8 and fck this bs
I appreciate the No Man's Sky callout.. I feel like as soon as Cyberpunk happened, everyone forgot just how shit that launch was.
pretty sure the accel pedal map is on purpose specifically to avoid jerky stress on the drivetrain and elec system. It softens out pedal input. As a lot of cars, even combustion, that have DBW, do.
Try to do the moose test with 4 adults onboard (with helmets)...
We gotta give it another go, the video game comparison was perfect. A patient car enthusiast may end up with that unicorn cheap EV that GM seems to be aiming for.
Who needs Beta-testers...when you have PAYING CUSTORMERS!  Sigh...
Do it....give it a round two
Vinfast is botting in the comments on every VF video. Sus.
Reminds me of the car from the movie Vacation 😂
I remember suggesting to someone that they put their foot on the brake before starting a rental car and they thought that was crazy. I drove a manual at the time so was used to having to have my foot on the brake.
It's good to see different companies coming to America. But they really need to up thier quality control. That car isn't meant for American roads I don't think
People make fun of it now, and the automotive journalists that get peddled by Big Auto are loyal. But just like the Japanese cars in the 60's and Korean's in the 80's, everyone makes fun of Vinfast now. But they are just making cars now to perfect their design and engineering. Wait 10 - 15 years. They are playing the long game.
No mans sky is so good now
This is definitely one of the cars of all time
now i know why the one i saw this morning was driving so poorly on the freeway lol
Yes. Give the start up another shot. It's a start. All start ups have hiccups.
its ridiculous that when a new car sucks everyone just sweeps most of the problems under the rug because "theyll fix it with software updates!" i dont care. if i buy a brand new car and drive it off the lot i want it to feel right from the factory. its unacceptable that these companies can avoid criticism of their bad cars because they can throw bandaid fixes on the computer related problems after the drivers were dissapointed or endangered by the car.
Please do a follow up video, they’re asking for a second chance…
It took me about a minute to figure out out to put a ‘23 bmw m3 into reverse at work the other day 😅
“Underdampened”? So what they aren’t wet enough? This is why I stopped watching this bs.
All new cars are junk. All of them.
they should go bankrupt they are junk
I will never buy a car that needs to be “patched”. had enough of live service BS from games
Should review more cars. Like the mk4 GTI 20tg AE or all of the GTIs. Like you did with the viper. And or the srt4
Give it a second chance.
Imagine expecting anything positive from this car to start with
I like the comparison to video games being released too early. That happens a lot in software. And it seems like the more software-controlled vehicles become, that trend will sadly continue.
This company is completely amateur hour. The compensation program alone sounds like it was conceived by a high school student.
Look at the board and you can see the video cuts
Here, beta test our vehicles. Basically.
Once the car is figured out I can see it fitting the bill for consumers who want a cheap humble electric vehicle. While i'm not the type of person to key an EV, I feel like this one would be spared from jelous people.
Vietnamese Communists, no different than Chinese Communists.
Definetly would like to ser the improvements of the nem software
if they paid you to be a beta tester = yes.  pay them $50k = no.
Do it for the tube
Cars have become the same as early access video games. how is this legal in anyway?
Would be cool to see a Geely made car review.
Too many brands filling their EV's with junk, people want a simple small SUV or hatch that just works. It's weird, I can go to Indonesia or India and buy a simple EV "that just works" but not in a western country.
Of course, do a follow-up video. Isn't that good reporting/journalism?
They're building a factory like 10 minutes away from me
after fixed its like vin diesel going fast?
i could buy a nice 911 for $50k just sayin
I bet that "Battery death" was just a blown fuse. A sudden in-rush of current when the driver floored it popped the main battery fuse and that's why it stopped working.  Early Tesla's had a somewhat related issue where the fuse would slowly fry it self after several years of hard accelerations until it got to a point where the fuse just popped entirely. Fortunately that's an easy fix, just replace the fuse.
The pinto of ev's but 48k more
like two clowns riding a tram for the first time
"Under dampened suspension"? Either you meant "under damped" or there is moisture involved.
For a 50k car that’s wild. Why would I get some hybrid bullshit when I can get a C5 and build my dream car for the same amount 😂
this sponsored as hell
Do an update
Was this car made by Google? You have to click the well-hidden dots to open the menu which has the start button.
How can be the worst reviewed car in America if that car isn't available on Argentina, Peru, Guatemala, Colombia, Jamaica, etc, etc. Idiot.
I actually want this car to be successful. I'm kinda rooting for Vietnam in that sense. It'd be cool for another to get into the international car industry (outside of their idea of a subscription service for the battery, and I don't know if that still a thing). I hope they figure their stuff out.
I’m Europe it will fail , for 50 000 you can buy Mercedes EQC
The fact that this company will throw money at you if your car messes up is kinda cool actually. As long as they pay up.   They have an incentive to improve, obviously.
I'll have all 50k back in a week!
I'm Vietnamese and this is exactly what I expected from a Vietnamese car.
The Tesla driving by laughing at it was hilarious
“If you do not have your blinker on you can’t switch lanes” isn’t that a driving hazard like if there is a sudden crash in front of you or something is on the road you could immediately swerve to try and avoid it,
I tell you what I do love that sunroof though! 🤠
Nice, car company rushing release just like games!
underdampened... not damp enough huh
To be fair to VINFAST, the current Audi system will steer u directly into a freeway divider if u turn your indicator off when exiting a freeway. DEADLY!
Oh please. Most people don't use their turn signals these days anyway. Uses too much blinker fluid.
Dude i want that fucken Miata "Wink Wink Nation" poster!!!!! Messege me back donut! 🍩
The fkn nod to Cyberpunk and No Man's Sky is legendary, I did NOT expect that from you guys lol
They dont sound like a shady company, just a new one that makes mistakes, thats ok.
I'm sure it's as bad as reviewed.  But watch them power through their shortcomings and in 20 years they'll nail their reliability then work on design and performance then compete on value.  10 years after that they'll have a luxury division.  Otherwise they'll fold in a few years
I thought it was a Mitsubishi Mirage 😂 😮
Vinfast sounds like a Carfax competitor.
You're really gotta remind me about my terrible video game purchase of no man's sky
To be fair this is vietnams best car since the Jeepney.
6:31 Yeah, see this car shouldn't have passed whatever regulatory body (NHTSA?) determines if a car is safe to drive, based on THIS ONE THING. If you need to suddenly avoid a crash and the steering wheel says NOPE, you're fvcked. That's a fatal design flaw. It's better to have a fleet of jackasses who never signal when changing lanes than a car that determines when you're allowed to change lanes.
love how donut uses porn music XD
Our Mazda MX-30 (don't have it anymore) also had the thing that it almost didn't let you switch lanes because of not using the blinker. You had to fight the steering wheel if you really wanted to change lane without using the blinkers🤣
With that money, i'd buy ioniq 5 for sureeeee
Do another review
If vinfast fails here then that means 30 years from now they’ll be a weird quirky car to own bc it was so bad like the Yugo or Daihatsu Charade. Also when you bringing back up to speed?
I have a big problem with the inability to turn the wheel without the blinker on. What if you were trying to avoid a near collision and happen to forget to turn on your blinker? Like someone slamming on the brakes, a deer, someone veers left of center at you, or a sudden accident on a highway? So you cant avoid an obstacle without the blinker? When people have to make split second decisions they tend to forget or make mistakes. I wonder how many accidents could've been avoided that involved this vehicle?
This car is for your great granny.
nobody disliked cyberpunk because of "bugs" it was just a shit game
oh look, a new yugo of america
I wanna know why they had sunroof originally and then changed it to drivers aid
Bring back the model T Ford.
I have seen one in person and did not look bad interior looks like Tesla outside looked sporty that was at mall .on streets the only one I have seen was broken down on freeway exit
Random car companies trying to cut corners. This is the new Hyundai.
I'd say make a whole series on VinFast updates and improvements and see how that car develops. It's not every day we get to see a brand new independent car company release a mass produced product without any badge engineering so let's see what happens
The only company that has the worst battery is fucking TOYOTA because even the mechanics tells you their battery sucks. a brand new car battery will last about 6months and a replacement from Toyota will last the remainder 6😂💀…what a joke
I def wanna see if they really fixed the bugs... caaaauuuse...wow
I guess Vinfast designed its cars according to what they saw in 1980s slasher movies.
Just make a Damn EV that works and doesn't cost a fortune. It doesn't need all their weird bells and whistles dude.
I don't want to defend VinFast too much here, especially since I don't know much about cars tbh... but I think I get where they're coming from on giving $100 for every day AFTER 3 days of service. Presumably, they are offering to service the vehicle for free. So like, those shocks or whatever? If that takes them 5 days, you get a free repair AND $200, get to keep the car, and presumably have a decent experience afterwards. I think that makes enough sense.  However, if they aren't fixing that issue for free, then it's really weird and stupid lol.
Alot of this stuff can can be fixed in post, I do agree it shouldnt have to be this way(its a car not a video game you just cant rely on patches to fix evreything)and Vinfast is not unique to this(they are however the most egregious of late). Things like this dont make good first impressions(ask any Chineese car maker about sterotypes that they have had to fight because of what went on a decade ago)but they are not insurmountable. Get patches for the chimes(Hyundai cars bong at you incessantly too btw) the lights and the ADAS. Have a recall for the accelerator pedal or address it in the customers next service and also during that service do a thorough diagnostic on the battery and retune the suspension(which will mean going back and retest it from the ground up). Fixing this stuff now instead of doing what other manufactuers do and make you buy the upgraded model will go a far way in repairing public perception.
Donut just reviewed every modern semi truck with this video
Actually this is a good example of why money doesn't just solve problems. There's a reason it took Hyundai years and lots of western manufacturing know how to make their first car, a simple cheap econobox (the pony). As far as i know Vietnam has no heavy industry and never has, things like forging, casting presses and so on. All this stuff takes years and years to understand and decades to master.
Exactly, James, if they would just electrify. A car and not try to make it something completely brand new. I'might go for it a little bit a little bit. But what they're doing is ignot to mention the fact that the country is nowhere near. Ready for the electrical pool, this is gonna put.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Would love to see an update with a straight from the factory vehicle
sorry but @0:33 only a mere 30 seconds in i'm already hugely upset that there is a company named vinfast and it's not owned by sir vincent diesel or named in honor of sir vincent diesel.
BMW drivers never being able to change lane again
50k for a car that looks and drives like that should be illegal
I saw one of these on Highway 24 the other day going towards Oakland
I kinda hope they put a parody of this in GTA VI and have it be the worst car in the game as a joke,
i hope this car comes with a prescription for lorazepam
Very sad
i gotta say that is a shocking car but i really hope for the company, and mainly the people that own them that the issues are sorted, problem is software updates are great and all but at the end of the day the basis that car is built on just isnt, so hopefully they release another car that, well, works if im honest lol.
you lost me at 14:23, it has been ridiculing car and drivers alike? huh...what, don't you mean it has been ridiculed?
totally agree about electric cars being over engineered they need to just make regular cars that happen to be electric instead of jamming as much unnecessary tech as they can into it
Nobody complained about the car in its home country?
I love Vietnam. I lived there for nearly 15 years and my wife is Vietnamese. But I would not buy a car made by them at this price. You wouldal understand the Chimes if you had ever driven in Vietnam.
Vinfast totally better than indo's esemka 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't get over the name, it sounds like some crappy car parts you'd get off of AliExpress
At 2:18, they have the sunroof on the list, but then it disappears at the end.
How much Ford , GM or Honda pay you after a car is in for repair after 4 days? Yeah, right… nothing. I don’t think that was bizarre
and when you go to order parts; parts person:  "ok you got a VIN?"  "yeah vinfast"  "ok what is it?"  "a vinfast"  "no i need you to tell me the vin"  ..."fast"... "yeah... sooner rather than later i guess...what is it?"  "it's a vinfast"  "NO I NEED YOUR VIN"  "you need me to bring it in?"  "JUST TELL ME THE VIN OVER THE PHONE"  "VINFAST"
who tf buy these cars? why wouldn't you buy a Tesla?
Needs review after updates.
make a Vinfast video in 1 year
This is one of those cars I would never consider, especially as a new release, as you don’t know if the company will exist 3 years from now and would not consider one until all the bugs are resolved. Even then, I likely would not consider it.
seams like the company just built the car for the customer to figure out all the issues so they could get the cars rollin out asap
I think a remade review is deserved as this is a new company and they are at least trying to go EV.
Gotta admit that $100 a day thing is pretty cool. I understand the 3 day deal because it's a reasonable amount of grace to give them to fix a problem before they're penalized. If only every car manufacturer did the same!
Maybe for 30 grand......maybe
The wife and I tried to take a Tesla out of the Hertz rental area in Orlando last weekend and because they didn't have cell phone service in the parking garage we couldn't figure out where to put the key to start the thing so we just switched to a Toyota minivan. Man I really wanted to drive that Tesla but it having a different startup sequence than a normal car from the last 100 years made us switch to a dang minivan a minivan, Yes a freaking minivan, anyways they should have a start button in every car.
I was at their opening, laughed my way all the way out of there
Goddamn this car makes my proton iswara looks like it came from a heaven
Yeah, but with No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk 2077, when they crash, they do it while they are hurdling you through traffic at speeds where impact may be catastrophic.  Oh, wait, no that's the other one.
Retaliating for the Vietnam war
I'm not sure if y'all mentioned this, but if you cannot change lanes without a blinker, that is a severe hazard. If there is something in front of you and you need to swerve out of the way, it may not let you and that could cause crashes
Do the reboot for Natalie!
Shout out to corncob TV and Nolan's Coffin Flop shirt
Let's be clear. Getting money back when your vehicle is broken is actually a solid customer focused benefit.
VW spelt wrong in the comparison i think :)
The issue with Vinfast is that A: They rushed it to market as you said. B: Nobody wants to buy an electric vehicle from an unknown Manufacturer. Especially at that price point. Their business model is flawed... They need to do it like hyundai in the 80's. Come into the market with a simple and reliable vehicle That doesn't have bells and whistles and sell it for thousands cheaper than anybody else. That's how they'd get the sales.
hmmmm sunroof???????🤔😳
Wish this car company all the best. Starting a new car company is insanely hard.
Odd to have gamer references in the vid, but okay 👍😅
Vinfast seems chill send it
Give me a new Volvo 240. Thanks
Needing updates always means they sold you something broken.  Doesn't matter who made it.
This car is gass without the g
Keep on top of the Updates and i wish them the best
ill be excited when we get a super basic, and affordable EV. Ditch the crazy features, just work and be a fair price.
I could understand if the car was dirt cheap - or had some fantastic finance offers. But 50 k? Nope.
Well it's a bit weird to buckle up if u just need to slightly move the car..
nah
NASCAR in lemans video?
Shout out to the Coffin Flop tshirt.   Love donuts commitment to ITYSL
Oh sh..t if you guy in vietnam, they have a express car repair service, they win dispatch a local police come to your home repair your car for free, plus invites you to one of THIER local police station dine with crabs and lobster all you can eat😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why wouldn't you compare it to the tesla. Because for the price you wont find a better EV.
More like BIN-FAST!
VinFast sounds like a diet fad
Editor missed a perfect opportunity to play "Jesus Take the Wheel" when the car turned back into the lane without the blinker on.
nice honda 6:01
Honestly, the chimes are annoying on a lot of new cars. I bought a new Hyundai that sends a warning everytime I have my turn signal on and there's a car in the next lane. Even if there are two turning lanes. It's annoying as poop.  Also, the cruise control will sometimes automatically slow down when I'm on the highway turn that has a middle barrier/wall.  It'll give me a collision warning at random times. Every time I turn off the car, there's a permanent warning thay I have a child in the back seat unless I manually push a button on the steering wheel. If I don't, and I walk away, the car alarm will sound. But I was able to turn that one off.  Kind of weird.
1:10 - You guys couldn't find a crappier fisheye lens to make this video more unwatchable? Because that looks really bad and I noped out. Maybe next time!
How’s Henry’s Suzuki? Could we get a follow up short or video? Also wondering about the full video on the build. That’s still in the works right?
Lol buy the car and find problems to  pay it off and have passive income 😂
Can’t believe you spelled Volkswagen incorrectly
Hey teslas were hot dumpster fires Ford and Gm customer service sucks ass and they still suffer from horrendous issues not unlike these guys but if they stick to their guns and keep up with the honest/open customer service then i say give em a shot cant be worse than what were all used to from the big manufacturers
this is what you get for buying a foriegn car, guys. DRIVE AMERICAN. In before the trolls: check the VIN of your next car. Find out what assembly it came from.get an old car if you have to. my ride's an 84 and it was ACTUALLY MADE IN AMERICA....
Shouldn't buy one at all. Same price range as other well established car manufacturers
Screw sitting in a box of emf
Like you said “Vietnamese” that’s why those cars  are shit
At 8:00 the Tesla's rims aren't even spinning!  Guess they're moving at the same rate as the camera's...whatever it's called lol
There are so many good used vehicles out there that I wouldn't spend fifty grand on any new one these days, BUT I do have to say that if you care about cars you can't buy the electric minivan they now call a Mustang, not unless you're gonna take it out back and shoot it.
Battlefield 2042 car
Did you use a fish eye lense? 1:20
Why are even people buying these ? Teslas,ioniqs and ev6s make sense but why would you want a non branded out of the blue basic electric car ?
WE'VE GOT IT! The YUGO of electric cars: The Vinfast!
No, don't waste your time retesting. Cars are often dangerous AF in the first place, and we need more Active Transportation and Public Transit. Appreciate all your fun car videos, regardless. We don't need companies pushing unfinished products onto our roadways, just like we don't need Tesla treating our streets as a beta test space.
Theoretically owning a vinfast could be a full time job
What happens in a situation where you must avoid getting into a crash? Is the car just like "hold my beer....really tight"
Nice
Test drive the aptera next.
If most of the problems with this car can be fixed with software updates, then the car shouldn't have been allowed to be sold until it was finished.  Sounds like they knew this was going to happen to me and they opted to go on and sell this dangerous crap anyway.  Just as bad as Tesla.  I honestly don't think either company's software should be allowed on public roads at this point.  These abysmal companies keep blatantly demonstrating that dollar signs are more important to them than human life.
Is not an ugly car. Would I buy it? Absolutely not. But there's always room for improvement.  Hope that as a company they can manage to find its foot and thrive.
Now I want more bad car reviews 😩
Lol, you should have driven all the crappy cheap cars we have here when Zach came to Brazil a  few months ago.
You are giving me a reason NOT to buy an EV. And say thank you!
Last week, people were complaining because the new Rolls Royce EV has got an 'engine start' button. But at least people know what it means.
I feel like not being able to change lanes when the indicator ISNT ON is a GOOD thing. Alot of you yanks don't indicate and just pull into a lane infront of another car
Same as Volvo to start
if this company is smart, they stop releasing cars and re-tool.  they need to fix a lot of these issues and re-launch
ok but you loan the car for 50k complain about every issue the car has and the car will basically pay every monthly payment right?
It's like every SaaS product in recent years😂
Not nearly worth 50k
rerun!!!!
I test drove one of the plus model VF8 last week in Canada.   I did not experience most of these issues you describe.  Accelerator worked fine, chimes could be easily configured to your liking, Heads up display ,  comfort, heating/collings seats etc all good.  The car did feel quite heavy and stiff......and it's true it was a bit bumpy,  or at least more so than you would expect from a SUV sized vehicle.    All of the problems I think can be fixed via OTA and seems my ride was better than yours.     However, the stiff suspension issue ...... that can only be fixed with a hardware change.   Would they do this to these early VF8 versions to help early adopters?     ONE BIG point your video is missing,  is that the price is not nearly $50k US as you stated, at least not here,   they have since dropped price significantly which is why I am even considering it.  ONE other small issue I found:    The rear seat heat and cooling controls can only be controlled from the front dash, so they need to ask driver to put it to their desired settings.
They launched a program called SAP,   Does that mean you would be a SAP to buy one,
This is just the beginning. Watch. These car manufacturers that are releasing electric cars will continue to release cars early that barely work and then just fix the problems with patch updates. Just like what the video game industry does. They will apologize. Fix the car with an update and then act like they didn’t just rip the consumer off.
I don't get this "oversprung underdampened" blunder. Why couldn't they simply copy a proven platform from VW, Renault, Toyota you name it? Or is it simply poor materials and/or QC issue?
So if I need to make an evasive manuever I need to put on my turn signal first or the car will override me? No thanks.
Update would be good.  Seems like a lot of software stuff.  The wonky ride, for sure a concern.    Def compare to US EVs like the Bolt that had massive recalls, and Tesla also kinda known for having a lot quality issues over the years including full battery shut down.
You press the break and put the car in drive to start a Tesla too.
m
It takes many years to fully develop..., and yet..., we are supposed to believe in the untested 💉
Doesn't it fels like a Delorean, but in 2023?
James, you need to trim your beard.
The styling looks like if you took a VW suv and took some inspiration from Nissan, and you get this
Oh last I heard of Vinfast was several years ago when this company was planning on launching in the US. I’m surprised they actually did.  Any one want to bet on how long they last in the US?
The car sucks because it’s an IPO scam from the Vietnamese Communist Party-backed megacompany. Their entire country is too poor and lacks the ability to be a player in high-tech.
Part 2
50k for that garbag ? Really ? Who in their right mind pay so much for that thing ? I don’t get it
Definitely follow this car for at least a year or two! Your content always hits! :)
I'm curious how the ride quality compares to my mini.  I love my mini, but low profile tires + their stiff suspension makes it for a rough/noisy ride.  But still a fun car to drive.
The Vin was indeed not fast 😅
To be fair, a lot of cars have crappy driver assist. My 2020 VW Tiguan R does the same thing where it wont let you change lanes with out indicating. Sometimes, when I overtake parked cars (without indicating), it will steer the car back to the centre of the lane and almost crash into the parked car! My 2022 Ford Puma ST and my wife's 2021 Ford Smax do the same thing but not as aggressive as the VW.  My Ford Puma often brings up a big red collision alert on the dash warning me the car in front has stopped, even if its at slow speed and multiple car lengths away.   In all fairness its a new company and they are clearly using new customers to beta test the cars for issues and I can see most of these issues being resolved. Lets face it, Tesla has had their fair share of issues like this and look how popular they are....
Good to see donut
So it's the new Daewoo...
ONE MORE TIME! ONE MORE TIME! ONE MORE TIME!  Lets see if they fixed it :D
The term "Vietnamese flashbacks" just got a whole different meaning for some of the folks out there...
My parents had a 2007 Sebring Touring Edition that used to shut off randomly. It was especially fun when it used to shut off on the highway. Chrysler/Dodge shit the bed since the early 90s.
I always wanted an overpriced piece of shit that doesn't work might buy one of these
Do it again! Let’s see those updatess
Couldn’t watch whole video. Reviews are bots 🤖 ✌🏽
The accelerateor is part of the driving aids
This reminded me of those ride-ons they sold at toys r us.  DOA and piece of recycling junk.  For 50k I would buy a Tesla
I like the blinker in a way....I wish people would use them more often and stop being idiots.
Why would you buy this car for the same price as an Ionic 5??
To be fair, the issue @11:43 that happened to Tom Peng describes exactly what happened to me too not once, but twice, in my 2021 Audi e-tron lease.
I sat in some Vinfast cars at the Toronto Auto Show and I was just not impressed, but I thought that it was just cause they were prototypes or pre production models. Plastic trim was coming off, the rear seats were way too small, the infotainments was intermittent, it was really really weird
My biggest complaint is that the government of NC eminent domain’ed a bunch of family farms for the company to make their factory on.
Let’s see a before and after video of the updates!
When you pose a threat for 1/3 cost here you go 😂
That mandatory blinker lane change is a common feature on new cars. That basically means you have to crash if you need to suddenly swerve in an emergency. At least give the driver an option to turn it off...  If a foreign auto company debuts in the US with a $50,000 car, I would be very suspicious, and this car perfectly demonstrates why. This Vinfast is a piece of Vin-trash.
Nolan calling anyone sensitive is a bit over the top…
By definition, it's not even remotely close to the "worst reviewed car". It hasn't existed for long enough.
An EV start-up from Vietnam. Riiiiiiiiiight... 🤔
I didn't know about the existence of that car till I saw it in 2023 Montréal car show 😅
Yes but a faulty videogame isn't capable of killing someone.
The car was designed for Vietnam's roads. They just straight up bring it over AS IS...
Well yes, give it another shot. However, $50k is way, way, way too much money for a car with no real dealership network, no residual values (it will be worth 50% after pulling off the forecourt) and of course no credibility in the marketplace. Buy the VW iD4 and fiddle with its software issues, but they will get fixed
Lol dont you always need to press the brakes when starting a manual car? It shouldnt even be a complaint, i use seatbelts anyways and close my doors
I fucking love no man’s sky lol
And they don't make a fast and furious vin diesel? Only electric?  ;)
So during an emergency lane change to avoid an object or stopped car on the highway, you can't change lanes?
Did u see the Tesla
a car from 1950 can out preform this garbage 💀
it's volkswagen, guys. ffs
That lane departure system is dangerous. If you need to swerve in an emergency, the car won’t let you. So bad. It should be banned from being sold.
Please follow up on this car
good thing is most of the issue seems to be software. other than the harsh ride.
Did anyone say Daewoo......
Should be a ride in one of the amusement parks, but definitely not on the streets.
yeah buddy! move fast and break things! Yeet!
Wtf was that at 8:46 😂
VW's Lane Assist jerks the wheel really hard like that, if you don't have the blinker on, too.
Let's see another.
Definitely make a follow-up video.
Would love to see a follow up vid. Make them put their money where their mouth is.
honestly the starting of the car got me understanding why it’s worst rated😭
Immediately into it, no keyless entry at $50,000 is already a fail
This car is a prime example of what happens if a government is allowed to over-regulate.  I'm not saying that this car is a result of over-regulation, but some of the features would definitely represent a politician's sense of a "good idea so let's do it", and the possible results that may not be unintended.  Example 1: It is a law that you must use your turn signal to change lanes, therefore a government mandates that the car cannot change lanes unless you use your blinker.  Example 2: For safety, the government mandates that if the accelerator is depressed too fast or hard, nothing happens.  Example 3: For safety, the government mandates that the car will not start unless all of the safety procedures are activated.  Example 4: if the car "senses" that something is wrong or dangerous, it takes over all of the controls.  I can go on.
Makes me confused as to why we would even bring this here? If it's because of the cheaper cost of the  vehicle I feel like ANY of the manufacturers we already have could easily make a better cheap car(the new hybrid corolla comes to mind)  But did I hear right?  $50k for this heap is s%&#?!?
Im getting nauseous just watching you guys bounce up and down like that 😂
Unlike tesla 😢
VinFast should change its name to VinCrap.  LOL  In all seriousness, I am surprised VinFast did not send police to your home to arrest you for saying negative things about its cars.  LOL
No sympathy for any idiot who would buy some stupid ass car like this. Why pay more for this when you could get a ton of options for less money from an actual manufacturer
My VW ID.4 is a sit and drive, same sequence as the Vinfast.  There is no start button!  Whenever I drive an ICE car, I kept forgetting to push the "stop" button and the silly thing would have to shift.
Wait, you can't change lanes without a blinker on?  That sounds dangerous as hell if there is a situation where you have got to do it in an emergency (sudden accident ahead, or debris that fell on the road suddenly), or as I saw last week a baby deer confused and standing in the middle of the road (baby did eventually get to the other side and back with its mom so had a happy ending).
For $50k I expect a lot more. For $10k as part of an 'introductory offer! Be our beta tester!' I'd be all over it
I feel like a car coming from Vietnam, technically a 3rd world nation, shouldn't be coming in hot at mid-high prices. They should have been trying to build a reputation in the affordable market.
Just cuz you guys gotta goodun don't mean no one else gotta baddun.  Appreciate the humor and detail in the review.
12:36 You think No Man's Sky got the bugs worked out?? That would be like if they promised a car and delivered a working roller skate, but you're like "bug free $50k roller skate. score!"
With the way they give cash for the vehicle issues this looks like a well thought out money laundering scheme 😁
Some people really have never had to drive a pontiac t1000 and it SHOWS.
It really is a car that feels like a modern video game. Released at full price, with broken basic systems and all the extra content costs more.
Who allowed this automaker to import to the USA and not those from China or France?? This car will give those that already hate electric cars more reason to hate electric cars..
This is why you never buy the first year of a new model especially if its from a new automaker being imported to the USA.
A lot of the issues with assist and chimes makes a lot of sense for Vietnams driving and infrastructure…developed for high density traffic and lots of chaos. America and Vietnam are very different, so I assume that these issues will get fixed the more the company gets familiar with the U.S. and it’s wide roads
Let's see the update video. Cuz I think it's easy to say, hard to deliver, and they have to deliver or their brand is DOA.
That "Special After Sales Policy" is like being paid to be a beta tester. Insane.
Doesnt switch lanes unless the blinker is on? BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!
Interesting to note that Vingroup was founded by Mr. Vuong in Ukraine when he lived there, and made his initial fortune popularizing instant noodles in Ukraine. He used the money from his initial fortune to invest in real estate and other ventures to become a billionaire.
I really want to see what the updates actually do for the car…
Its a problem with electric cars altogether. They are so easy to make - no emissions, no big drivetrain development costs - really easy compared to ice.  That means pretty much anyone who can afford a factory can throw them out - which invites the people who would usually not be able to get the car correct to the party.  Thats why there are so many start up ev brands and so many are of such low quality.
The vehicle owner should give Donut $100 for the inconvenience of driving this vehicle.
Throttle may be codded like this as to not feel too jumpy due to, you know, instant power to the wheels and let's be honest it's not drive by wire to instantly react to everything
It's a matter of time until someone tries to avoid rear-ending a car in front of them but doesn't turn their blinker on and ends up dying.
This is literally making a 2021 BMW i3S look good!!!
Couldn't watch past the whole trying to start it thing.
Any Vietnamese hereeeeeeeeee ??????
Of course we want to see a follow up, but make it a real test. What I mean is, you guys did a fun piece on a handful of complaints that other reviewers had.  Next time, insist that you keep the car for a week.  Take it home, charge it, run it through a car wash, use the radio, adjust the seats, and do things that we all expect to work.  You are not Consumer Reports, but your viewers DO want to know whether or not the headlights are OK and whether or not the car pulls to one side.  Find a way to do a fun, irreverent Donut review that goes beyond what anyone else could find out with a 10 minute test drive. Also, if there was an already-released OTA update fixing these things, why didn't your test car already have it?  Ask the owner of the car whether or not she received an OTA update.  Was Vinfast honest about  that?
So...while Im glad they are fixing the bugs that doesnt solve the complete lack of confidence in their own QA testing of both the software and the hardware. You mean to tell me that during their testing of the proximity sensors they never noticed that they just flat out DO NOT WORK correctly? This means either their testing methodology is fucking abysmal, or they just aren't testing it at all. Maybe Im a stickler, but I honestly don't think they can recover from this kind of failure.  You would have to pay me a significant amount of money to get into a Vinfast car.
Just realized why there are so many new EV cars in the market unlike traditional ice cars where u have a true and tested engine and than also meet emissions controls and each countries is different so it’s harder to make one engine that works globally but with EV’s u side step all that
I want to feel bad for the people that bought one but man that was a dumb financial decision.
I’m excited to drive one of these. It seems like absolute trash and I want to see a dumpster fire
American people never buy this car.... Because vinfast couldn't anything most parts make by China... vinfast only assembly in Vietnam... worse electronic car in the world....
I know the blinker thing can be a pain or annoying, but living in Arizona where none of the Mongoloids ever use a blinker, I kinda like the idea of “No Signal, No lane change”. Keeps these mouth breathers from cutting people off and causing accidents.
Please make another video of the updated software!!!
Yeaaah idk if im confident in Vinslow's future, no mans sky STILL sucks and i doubt idris elbow wants to make a cameo for any janky Vietnamese auto manufacturers lol
How about a car people are actually buying. Doing a review on this unseen car is pointless. I’d rather see something that’s actually being bought by Americans in America
Can't wait for the update video to see its still catastrophically shit.
Can you go over the camera setup? 3:31
I think the fact that is Vietnamese is a reason for auto journalists to hate on the car... that being said, I don't think I will ever purchase a Vietnamese car ever.
I know the blinker thing can be a pain or annoying, but living in Arizona where none of the Mongoloids ever use a blinker, I kinda like the idea of “No Signal, No lane change”. Keeps these mouth breathers from cutting people off and causing accidents.
They should make an ev that is just an electric car, not a product for tech nerds
VinFast sounds like a car company owned by the great @edbolian
This cars build is about as solid as a Bathesda game on release day. This was painful to watch
I was wondering if it would be another case of Audi's early days with reviewer sabotage. But looks like the complaints are justified.
If nothing else, i think the VF8 looks a lot better than the Ioniq and Mach-E
to me the most shocking thing is the reveal of james's great head of hair when he takes his hat off
Aye at least they giving money back 😂🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ford would’ve just recalled and fucked u
Early access cars with promise to patch later
I really hope they succeed. The Vietnamese people are one of the hardest-working and genuine people. And I don't say that lightly, as I'm a non-Vietnamese Asian, and we all hate each other.
Definitely do another review👌🏻
So it’s a VW 😂😂 you have to press on the break to turn it on
Trash excuse for a car
They have so many cars ready to sell rn😂😂😂😂😂
jerky wheels and chimes. welcome to any modern car with aids.
umm so if they already fixed those problems through over the air software updates, shouldn't this car have automatically updated then? I don't buy their explanation. good video 👍.. get it together vin fast.
YESSS I DO....
The most surprising thing in this video was James's hair.
I work at dealership and there’s a vinfast dealer that setup shop up the street earlier this year, no one is buying those things AT ALL, these past couple weeks they’ve even had some trucks come by and take some away because these aren’t selling, not to mention this is the only model they offer
I'm only have way through but 🤷🏾‍♂️What happened with the sunroof? Couldn't find any where else to mount the cameras? 🤔
The startup sequence is not any more weird than my model s, especially when using the card key.
That car would not be certified as safe to drive on European roads. Accelerator not working!!! No way is that a safe car. The Americans really must be burning all the regulations like they promised back  in 2017.
Just another SUV in a world that needs more 2-door Hatchbacks.... RIP 2-door hatchbacks, you are missed!
Nolan looking at James like he’s his old man complaining about everything haha
I think you guys forgot to mention you buy the car but "rent" their battery. You gotta pay a monthly subscription to drive x  amt of miles and pay extra for every mile over LOL
I LOVE NOLANS COFFIN FLOP SHIRT!!!!!!!!
I just cruise on with my non-spec Audi from 1992 and enjoy life. ....
Beta release of the car distributed to beta testers for measly 50k.
I think korean/chinese cars are far far worse!
yea man do it again for the update yall....we need all the competition we can get out in the market..
Update after the update
50,000 dollars for this thing with that kinda money you could get Something cool like 69 chevell.
Rushing too fast to production!????? Wait, I thought that comment is already reserved to the Hummer EV...🤔
Who edited this? One scene has boxes coloured in followed by a scene with no boxes coloured followed by another scene with different boxes coloured in.
I'm shocked, shocked I tell you.
I got a 1990 Celica GTS. Everything works fine.
It is very very strange but I also read good review about Vinfast VF8 from some US publication for example the Engaget The Detroit Bureau JD power Novak Channel and from Canadian press so I prefer to test the car by myself because I am intelligent to have my own opinion.  Thanks for sharing but i really have a doubt about the sincerity from this review. Give me your thought.
Anybody else trying to figure out what happened with the Sunroof?
I could buy 2 lightly used ND Miatas for that price!
Tell you what, if Vinfast includes free pho and banh mi for 100,000 miles I'll consider it.
7:35 uhmmm  I wonder if my fiat tipo wagon could be even worse 🤔
Wait we can finally see his hair!!
Please please please do more followup episodes on Vinfast. You guys have a chance to document the rise (or fall) of a new company and that's pretty amazing. Not to mention with you guys covering the issues, it puts a light to the problems and will help them be fixed and or known.
ChangLi > the world
me watching donut while doing the donut missions in forza 5
the company seems promising im always keen for a new car manufacturer to step into the market
6:20 imagine u had to dodge some incoming vehicle or object maybe even a car accident happened right infront of you so you try to turn and the car is like nah bra you forgot your blinker
It reminds me of my house thermostat programming.
mache smokes it
Optically  James with baseball hat = redneck  no hat = surfer.
I never thought I'd see a no man's sky reference in a donut vid but I'm not complaining
This car is literally a drivable torture device.
They're trying to say Coffin Flop isn't a show!
Wow. I’ll keep my Nissan. Lol. I heard some issues. I didn’t know they were this bad.
cool director)
That is one of the biggest problems I have with "modern" cars: The -noise- chimes.  Engineer: "Hey, we made our vehicles so soundproof, people are merging into others and running over kids because they can't hear them! What do we do?" Marketing: "Make synthetic sounds to alert them!" CEO: "That's brilliant! We can upsell customers on  those as 'safety features'!" Engineer: "Won't that be treating our customers like they can't drive?" CEO: "Our customers are buying 2.5 ton pickups to go grocery shopping. I'm surprised they have enough neural activity to even blink. Do it."  Meanwhile in roadster territory: "The only synthetic audio alert you will get is *the phone.* "
Crossing fingers for a follow up vid 🤞🏻
Absolutely like a followup. 😂
Donut is growing old lmao. 3 years ago James was shouting MO POWA BABY at the top of his lungs, today an EV is giving him a headache. We're aging 😩
Imagine spending 50k on a car like this and having someone review how bad it is . Do your research Natalie
Vinfast facerolled by challenging premium tier cars without any experience in the industry. They should have started with affordable cars and refined their products from there (like pretty much everybody else does)
Yeh yeh do it again!👍 🚗💩
Yes please review it again once they have some time to fix issues. I didn't know this brand existed before now, and I am interested to watch the journey of them either making it or breaking it. More!
Where? I don't see a mustang anywhere in this...😛
Love this channel
Doesn't Vinfast let people from Europe, Anerica and other countries that import the car to review them before exporting them? I guess not.
kind of lame countries that are just getting into the car industry are just making them look like everything else rather than do their own thing
I'm a simple man I want my car to go forward backwards and most importantly stop, none of these problems are with that simple stuff, all of the complaints are due to the added bs that you don't need.
The new yugo, execept it isnt cheap :P
Anyone dealing with audio being loud and soft in this video?
Imagine being mad that the car doesn't do the job of driving for you... What kind of drivers are on the road today?
Maybe the company didnt pay the journalists enough to talk good about it. You do know that youtubers make videos for money
better question is why anyone would buy a car from a unknown unproven brand. especially one that costs 50k.
its pretty bad when donut, automotive youtube's happy boi gives you a scathing review.
Maybe Winfast should buy Emellie from NEVS
Its the Yugo for 2023
never even heard of this brand
Give it another chance!
They’re pretty much realizing DLC updates to fix the car……
I'm sick and tired of companies pushing out tech before it's ready and has been thoroughly tested. They treat paying customers like the beta customers. If I'm getting something like this it should be at a discounted price and the customers input should be compensated for making the product better. This "Just get it out there and we'll fix it later" has got to stop. I can't believe they're doing this with cars now where people's lives are at stake.
This car should Doug Demuro check it out!
To start the car by buckling up, branke pedal, and shifting to drive, don't other EVs like some Volvos and Teslas do the same thing or similar?
Because I’m a gambling man… I’d buy a Vinfast just to try to report a type 3 issue
And here I thought my steering wheel rumbling when I change lanes because of lane assist was annoying in my Alfa Romeo Stelvio.
It's the concept of the auto industry changing something that was extremely simple as turning a key/pushing a button to multiple steps. In an alternate look at it, yes, it seems like It's easier, but ultimately, it's adding more steps to something that was never complained about or had an issue with. Except by maybe privileged lazy people. I don't want to push a button. That's toooo hard! 😂
Part that gets me the worst is where the car has systems that override the driver's decision making. That's insanely dangerous. Completely unacceptable. I wouldn't drive that car if you paid me to, just like you couldn't get me on the 737-800 MAX with a gun to my head, for the same reason: the plane has systems that override the pilot, meaning that in an emergency situation a pilot doing something out of the ordinary to save the plane will be forced to crash. Unforgivably unsafe.
I blame cyberpunk purely on people that sent death threats and threw bricks through the windows of devs homes.
Kinda like the VW ID3 "at least here in Norway". There were so many that got money back due to issues, inc the windshield fogging up when driving. They had a court case for all the owners because they did feel they bought a beta access car that had a ton of issues that were fixed with updates over time.
even the pedals sound like plastic. like, those were noisier than usual when james was mashing the gas
I think you guys should give Vinfast another chance at redemption, I think it's only fair because they rushed their vehicles and all of their issues were not resolved. Give Vinfast another chance.
did they drive 15mph on a highway??? did they have police escort while filming?
is called Vin Fast because its for the family
Great the car companies have learned from AAA game developers and are now releasing early access cars. What a time to be alive.
always ready  to criticize
Try too look vinfast partner.. hahah
I am just glad Vietnam is trying, if it is not just another Chinese manufacturer in Vietnam.
I saw one one these on a CA freeway hogging the passing lane going 5 below the limit and tried to see and wondered what person bought a 50k junk on wheels?
This car looks terrible too
Why did the board go from Drive aids to sunroof to drive aids again lol
How much money did they have to give the owner?
Seeing all these complicated drvier aids and electronic systems makes me wish someone would have the brass balls to just make a _basic_ electric car, like a mid 2000's Yaris but battery powered. Closest we got was the Nissan Leaf.
These vin vehicles are booked back Vietnam soon
Please do revisit them.   There needs to be more competition in the industry.   I'd hate to see a new company - from a country we don't normally associate with cars - get buried immediately.   This really comes across as a Yugo sort of situation.
Yes update and re do please
Yeah scary stuff on the lane change. Try again, give ‘em a fair chance
After seeing the entire video, I'm very happy with my 2000 Honda Civic...
Did you give her $100?
Too bad it has the same logo as my imaginary car brand at the age of 8😢
I get that it was rushed out, but even still, it seems like some of those problems should have been addressed even under the most minimal of testing.
Being compared to Cyberpunk is probably one of the most scathing reviews anything could ever have.
You can't fix the suspension with an OTA update
vinfast in 1 year
The last car that we got that was built in a communist country was the Yugo. We all know how that went.
This was a really good conclusion by you guys. It's great that new automakers are trying to get their foot in the door with the growing electric car market, but if the cars aren't good from the beginning, there's no reason to recommend them yet.
Seems more like the car should be called "VINfu**ed".
Cars and car manufacturers seem to be increasing insulting the intelligence of their drivers. I don’t need the car to constantly tell me there are cars around me I’m on the road I fuckin know.
$50K? for this pos? Wow people are so easily duped.
Why did it take him that long to "start it"? The car said "READY". All he had to do was put it in Drive.
13:10 was the first time I saw James without a cap. He just lools line an entirely different guy with his hair showing :o
Looks like a pretty easy way to set up a lawsuit. Have some one slam on their brakes and then you try and get out of the way by turning the wheel and when it wont let you and causes an accident.
at least they delivered on a product, and seemed receptive to customer complaints, unlike some companies ahem *nikola* which is downright fraud.
In 10 years will James be doing an "Up to Speed" on VinFast? Time will tell
The no turn without blinker “feature” would anger all bmw drivers a lot
One does not simply start a car company.
so ANOTHER company that will drain the world supply of lithium even faster,,,,,lol
This looks like a very bad choice to spend 50k. The chimes, God, who needs them in any car? Just give us a button to turn them all off.
imagine future car with so much broken feature, then patch it over time like triple a game, we are fucked
His face
I still don't understand how this car is worse than a tesla
I appreciate the No Man's Sky and CP2077 analogy. This is a car channel that really speaks to me.
I hope genuinely that this company fails, not because I hate the car or anything but just to send a message to car companies that delivering unfinished cars cannot happen going forward because it's ruining the gaming industry and will do the same to the car industry
Hey, remember when cars didn't need software updates?
Made in Vietnam products have the worst customer safety and quality.
Try again with the updates
I knew it wasn't gonna end good for vinfast when y'all did the upcoming cars of 2023 videos at the beginning of the year 😂😂😂 just cuz u a billionaire doesn't mean u can just create a car company and drop cars....that go for vinfast and Elon musk 😂😂😂
COFFIN FLOP!
give Vinfast another shot
Please do a follow up
Fuck all to to do with the car   James' hair is mint.
This is clearly what a $35,000 EV looks like.
Car with the most buyers remorse of 2023 is the Toyota CHR, which just based on how it looks, I don't get it. It must be really terrible to drive if people hate it that much despite looking that good (for a crossover)
The thing is they’re pricing puts it right in the firing line of some pretty decent cars , and even if they fix all the bugs the damage has been done , no one will trust any future releases
when I first saw this car pre production, I assumed it would be in the under 30k category. 250 mile range is similar to the chevy bolt. who would gamble 50k on a new brand when the car has such average stats and looks. tesla rivian lucid all had some impressive stats before they became trusted.  even without any issues this car would be a flop with that price tag.
There are a lot of parallels with Daewoo’s auto manufacturing history. They both started remaking others companies’ cars as their own, made their own vehicles that underwhelm expectations and tried unique marketing strategies that didn’t resonate with the public. Let’s hope Vinfast doesn’t end up like Daewoo.
First EA, Ubisoft, CD Project Red, and other triple A studios released  unfinished games that are filled with patches now we got cars coming out that are unfinished and the manufacture is releasing patches to fix it. Bruh
They should not have that name in North America.
What is stopping me from buying a Ioniq or Mach E for the price of this?
Only 250 mile range is not going to cut it..needs at least 350
This thing fking sucks. Im a Vietnamese btw and i refuses to be bias towards it just because its a "viet made" car. I hate how the brand handles negative reviews too, they make a whole subreddit full of Vinfast employees just to down vote every single negative reviews that came it way.
Bethesda just released a car no way
I still love you guys but please bring back the OG content. I’m talking more science garage, money pit, etc. l love a lot of what you guys have been doing but I miss the OG money pit Miata and Z’s. True technical car content for car people. I get you’re trying to appeal to a wider audience with these videos, but please make it a balance. Love you guys
What's happens if you need to switch lanes fast because of an obstacle. Does that mean can't force the car change lanes. If that's the case that got to be dangerous.
Fun fact: VinFast is not a car brand by Vin Diesel of Fast and Furious.
At least Vietnam is now a good communist country, at least for you RepubliKKKan MAGAts. Thank Jesus Christ is not China, right?
I wanna know if they really fixed the issues
Dude... in the opening you talk about  it shutting off while driving... have you heard of Tesla? They screw ppl over and shut them down, disable charging and more while people are traveling.
Yep, everything I expected from Vinfast.  But let's see the follow up video with the fixes, on that same car.
I’m really interested in cars coming from new places so I hope this company can get it figured out. Sounds like they’re trying so hopefully that’s a good thing.
Actually, that the car tries to get you back in your lane if you're not using blinker, is quite common on at least euro spec cars. It's a basic functionality at the very bottom (level 1) of self driving.  As far as I can remember, at least the 3 last cars I've leased had this functionality. All of them were from well known established European manufacturers (BMW, Fiat and Peugeot).  It might not be to your liking, and it might not even be common in US spec cars for all I know, but it's a common feature in modern cars.
Who knew an EV would have Turbo lag!
I hope you guys get to review the Turkish national car, the TOGG, from concept car in 2019 to on the road in April 2023. Its direct competition is with other compact SUVs such as the Tesla Model Y or the Volkswagen ID.4 and currently costs about US$55,000 in Turkey. FYI it has a built in Selfie camera!
I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏😊 please read  Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better. And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea. Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself. I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏  Amen.  I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊  ''   CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, Please forgive me and my friends and my family for our immoral acts, please help guide us in a positive direction and please help us against evil. Please save us from Hell and have mercy on our souls. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen.  ''  Please say this at least once a day for at least a month, do it longer if you want to and can 🙏  You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏😊 Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol.

Whomever was dumb enough to buy one of these, deserves all the trouble it's gonna give them.
To have any chance of succeeding they need to make super cheap/good value for money cars like the Dacia sandero. Nobody’s gonna pay 50k for a “vinfast”
Vinfast should've come in at a cheap price (like Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Kia did) and slowly work up as the quality improves.
Teach me about cafe racers please
This car is so bad it will ruin Vietnamese reputation.
(:
are you guys biased against tesla? at 0:43 you don't even mention the most popular electric suv?
Yes, keep dispelling the cheap Chinese crap stereotypes Edit: yes I realize it isn’t Chinese, that’s the joke
Lol the same reviewers complaining about the start procedure are the same ones who praised the exact same start procedure In all Teslas.
DON'T FORGET THE FOREVER LEASES ON THE BATTERIES LOL.
How come this vehicle is worth $50.000 to begin with
I would give them a few months, maybe a recall campaign and get back to see what is Vinfast up to
regarding the accelerator pedal,  my parents own a 2014 v6 dodge durango and i can do the same thing with the pedal, slam it down for a full sec and nothing happens, then finally it drops 4 whole gears.  As a gamer the pedal lag is brutal to drive with IMO.
Sounds like it has driving AIDS
Considering how fast-paced the markets have become, I believe that they're doing pretty good. They are already admitting to and fixing issues, whereas major corporations would've taken time to push back against allegations. And for them to be like we will fix your car, and if it takes more than 3 days, we'll pay you money as an apology for taking too long is awesome. If I took my dodge in for service and told them I wanted $100 a day cash for every day over estimate, they would laugh and have security escort me out. I really hope they pull out of this on the positive because better US sales create a need for US manufacturing facilities and, in turn, create jobs for US citizens. All that said... I am honestly of the mindset that automakers need to return to building long-lasting vehicles and stop wasting resurrecting these throw-away 💩 boxes that some of are blowing up in the first week of ownership.
It's a brand new company I'm curious to know how will they can refine this car with a few updates and patches
Sounds like the automotive journalists who have been in the pocket of the major manufacturers are a bit quick to dismiss newcomers no?
Software issues won't fix that suspension though unless it happens to have active shocks on that thing.
Volkswagon 😄
Cyberpunk was in development for over 10 years before it released, that is why it received all the criticism, not because it was rushed, but because they had more than enough time to get it right.
Honestly, seems like the majority of the issues can be fixed with updates. And let's not forget that Tesla STILL, to this day, has a ton of problems.
History has countlessly demonstrated the path for foreign or unproven companies to experience product growth.    Introduce a cheap, reliable, product that appeals to the masses because they're more likely to consider price over style/design/brand. For example in the US look at the ford model t in 1920s, Honda in the 1960s, Toyota and nissan in the 70s, hyundai and kia in the 90s-2000s. They started with cheap, decent cars bought by people unconcerned with brand image. As they improved design, reliability, and image theyve become some of the most popular vehicles on the road.   Did they not ask themselves " will people buy an inferior $50k car from an unknown manufacturer when market competitors offer more at the same price?"
Please do a followup i would love to see it!
I refuse to believe that it wasn't bad on purpose. Quite a clever idea to release a cheap, substandard version, get people talking about it. Then use the classic come back story once you've used the press and early customers as the free beta testers.
American car has never been a good car.. after market price killing me all the time!!!
accident ahead !! change lanes QUICK !! lets put on the cars blinkers.. now lets check the DA & change lanes..  seems unsafe at any speed..
This car is just going to be your average 2030 model
… so did the owner, natalie, not have the car connected to starbucks wifi before your review?
; are they using their customers as QA? and paying em for finding bugs xD LMAO
Yeah, test it again. Also be interesting to share the attitude they took when called out and which problems they were able to fix for people who already bought one. How firms react when things go wrong counts for a lot. And it can still be fun to watch if you guys make it fun. No pressure!
As a modern gamer, hearing "patching majority of issues with software updates" makes my skin crawl. I don't want problems in cars normalized under the guise of "oh it'll be patched next month"
50k gets you a solid luxury car.  This POS doesn't deserve to be 50k.
Why would anyone buy a $50k Vietnamese EV import? 😂
Life sure has changed when the worst car in the US still costs $50K.
Yeah, I'd like to see an updated video on a vinfast with the upgrades......and maybe try it on some canyon roads just for good measure (but please don't die in a fiery wreck) 😢
Fuck yea we want to see vinfasts redemption
I'm a North Carolinan.  I still can't believe my tax dollars are paying for VinFast to build their US Plant!!!! Uggggggg!
Blinker thing shouldnt yank the wheel but def should give an annoying sound alot MF just be doing dumb shit
The Type 3 issue compensation makes sense. $100/day will get you a fairly decent rental car. At Enterprise, you can get a INFINITI Q50, Audi A5 Sportback or similar  for $100/day.
VW and Audi also tug on the wheel if you try to change lanes. It doesn't do it as violently as this one did though. The Audi I drove scared me when I came across some unusual road markings that confused the system, it was tugging both right and left.
VinFast is basically Cyberpunk 2077 of car world. That's very messed up when you think about it
what is the range?  HELLO? charger compatibility and charge time?  how does it handle in rain at night?
the startup thing makes perfect sense.  if you have a manual, you have to have the clutch down to start the car, so all evs/autos should also have a brake-to-start kind of safety thing... also it's the law to wear seatbelts, so having that connected to the start process should have been a thing like 40 years ago.
You can see them getting sicker as they drive more. Their face goes from smiling to sick by the end. That slime super cut was almost disturbing.
Who would spend 50 g’s on a car that isn’t known?
i wonder if there are settings on the console there that you can use to shut off the annoying noises, and the useless "safty" features that make it impossible for you to have fun in one of those
Our state (NC) just gave them billions in tax incentives 👀 👀 👀
My tesla does the same thing. You can turn it off.
You see a faulty car, i see passive income
I come back here to make my day. Well I'll come back tomorrow again. You guys are amazing. Reach 10 mil sooooonn.
That scumbag company is forcing people off their land and out of their homes near Greensboro, NC just so they can pollute the land and water and build trash. It should have been taken to a track to test a much faster reverse and to see how it really handles.
Try this car again!
The Car is just like living in LA ... It's a expensive load of promised hopes and dreams but its just crap all around 🤣
Fuck all the electronics. No thanks.
It's annoying when AAA games release incomplete. It's unacceptable and deadly for a car to come out in Early Access.
2005 5sp Base Cobalt is 1000x better car than this piece of shit. And I can repair it.
i prefer the way this looks to BMW and mercedes SUVs
IT WILL CATCH ON FIRE!!!
What is the "rolling" issue that they have cut, does anyone have a guess?
I gotta be honest with you. I just got a 2023 VW Golf R. Fully loaded. 20th anniversary model... And it has by far the worst interior and user interface of any car I've ever driven or been in, or even seen reviewed anywhere. It's actually so bad that Volkswagen has acknowledged it and plans to change it as soon as possible.
50k for this yikes. I guess putting a big center screen excuses you from a lot of things
Eventually it will catch on fire so be careful.. that's no joke
thx - glad i did not buy one
I would value that at around 20k. It acts like a kids first cheap car that happens to be a electric.
There is WAY too much software in modern cars. I don't want a software patch to fix it after it leaves the factory. I want it to not kill me at day 1.
That's where technology in vehicles is going. Catering to absolute idiots that can barely drive in the first place. Newer cars will tell you everything you need to know that a common sense person would already know. All those sensors are for people that can't pay attention.
your mom is the worst ride ive been on !
Early Access coming to the auto industry
Do an UP TO SPEED!! This is BS
Alternative title: "America just got a new car manufacturer, and it's bad"
Yeah, give this fledgling car company another shot.
I'm okay with all the issues , only if this car was $15k new. At $50k I can't handle anything
Would love to see how much Vin would freak out if you take is lightly off road or few laps at a track.
VIET CONG can not design S. This car is assembled from China automobile parts. VC can even make a car screw properly, it's all the Chinese stuffs that Vinfast put a label on and called it made in Vietnam🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought it's chinese beacause styling-wise it looks like a renault knock-off
i'm shocked how it is not a kia
If I was a Billionaire and I had my vision board in my office. Making a car for the United States Market would be at the bottom of that board. There is literally a 500 page book of regulations you have to meet, 99% of American car manufacturers have gone out of business for one reason or another. If you guys don’t know the young man at the beginning of the video with glasses on is homeless. Donut has been hiring homeless people since 2017. Let’s give them a hand for making this world a better place.
oh shit, now we are getting early access cars
I have a 2020 Toyota Corolla and the lane assist does the same thing. If you don't blink, the car will throw it back to the middle of the lane. It's extremely annoying.
Just please keep them off the roads of the USA! My daughter drives on those roads!
Maybe there are punji sticks in the seats.
make an Up To Speed already rather than this craps
Using the Cyberpunk 2077 case for the PS4 was maybe not the best choice, since it's still mediocre on the PS4 and won't have the newest patches and expansion released on the old platform.
You should do a follow up with the same car.
Liked the vid doesn't deserve a 2nd chance
give em 6 months
Just get ride off that pile of garbage  before  you die in it😂😂
Follow up! Follow up!
I see these things parked up in Topanga Mall parking lot, I was always wondering what they were.
Looks like a beta version release of an actual car.
It could be QC but that's good they're trying, take some time to make it good & safe though
this car is like an ex girlfriend. it gaslights you on when it’s safe, it’s draining to be with, hard to move, and fights you every step of the way between it all
they paid the video
Even the closed captions get it, calling it driving AIDS
Why buy a Model 3 or Model Y when you could have overpriced trash with zero support?
What in the aaassssss!
do it again!  i’d love to see if vinfast is legit about their fixes
Those weren't headaches, they were micro-concussions.
Imagine me ever owning an EV anything (remembers owning an electric golf cart)...nEVermind. <shit!>
So Vinfast is gonna go broke from all the payouts?
Damn the owner of vinfast must be fucking jacked from throwing all that money around.
If they don’t fixed these quirks, the company will be Vinished.
I can say that I am glad Vinfast is getting the criticism   In Vietnam, the company has time and time again ignored the concerns of customers/owners. Instead of addressing it, they have reported the owners of the other Vinfast vehicles to the local Vietnamese authorities as a way of sweeping the issues under the rug and silencing the criticisms.    All in all, the company has been very arrogant in recent years saying that they will dominate the overseas market whist just ignoring the cars’ problems in Vietnam.   So I’m not surprised one bit that it’s all going wrong for them now that they’ve opened up to the US market.
"In hindsight, it's pretty intuitive."  No. Just, no. The whole point of the word "intuitive" is that you don't need prior knowledge, and hindsight is prior knowledge.
Yes, please make more videos about this brand and it's "fixes"
Get whistlin diesel to blow it up
I would defend, but is a electric so it deserve the hate.
This is at best a 27,000-30,000k car. Do another review of the updated car. Let’s see what they fixed.
Nice hat, “Cars are pain❤” lmao.  It’s almost like they don’t want us to have control….over simple things, even like when to accelerate or lane change(unsafely?), bc their might just be that one moment that you react and if you could avoid danger, these genius paperbacks pushing engineers decisions say “car no go, stupid American”, like Bro WTF?? $50K here is like riches over there in Vietnam right? - yes I did not calculate the exchange rate.
they really said “i’ll pay you $100 to fuck off”😭
I think most of this could be forgiven if it was amazing value. Only. It isnt.
The chimes s are like the first time you get a phone and get text messages non-stop so you silence it but I'm guessing the car doesn't have that lol
Funny I just watched a video about a guy who work for over 2 years on the sounds of the notification noises for a Toyota Camry. THAT is the difference in detail that adds up (they even spend a shit ton of time just of the sound the door makes when you close it. A satisfying thunk sound, translates to build quality in peoples minds, car makers know this. )
Blindspot only works if you are above a certain speed, NOT when you are stopped or usually below 10-15kph.  Maybe check the owner's manual for some things first.
You should re-test.
The 405 has a good section!
Haven’t watched any USA reviews yet; but this intro have me believe these claims could be true… saw one (without license plates yet) sitting in the emergency lane a few weeks ago.
Check back in six months with this particular one if you can.
Maybe we just need to go back driving cars by ourselves and not rely on technology
I wouldn't piss on that POS if it was on fire!!!🤣🤣🤣
Personally, I hate cars I tell me how to drive them. The only thing I want to hear from my car is the engine and my blinker blonkin. There a line between a driving aid and assuming all driver are stupid.
idk
It’s EXTREMELY unsafe to not be able to change lanes without your blinker. How did this pass anything resembling NHTSA’s safety tests?
OR… are the American reviewers mocking it just because most have been ICE loving channels and are scared of it… just sayin
Nah if I've got to put my seatbelt on every time I run out to start my car to get the ac or heat running, I'm gunna be super annoyed lmao
Please do give this 'thing' a fair shake.They seem to be trying.
I would like to see an uodate, maybe their customer support will be really good with fast resolutions. My neighbor has a Dodge Hybrid Van that still hasn’t had its recall fixed after 10 months
ain’t no way that’s 50,000
the real " CAR IS PAIN "
The unmitigated gall they have to release to the public…
Dear Vinfast: We sincerely request a car that gives us control at the risk of pancaking into another object. We understand the risk and accept it. Thank you.
Im waitin tílko sombdy LS swaps it
Who thought a fisheye lens were a good idea?
50k?!!! I just got a loaded model y for 47k! WTF man!
As bad as it is, it’s cool that the company is standing behind it. If they fix it all and compensate as they say. Good on them!
Is anybody surprised.  Who would buy one of these in the first place. There are too many EV's in this price range.
Dear Vinfast……ditch the shit self driving nonsense, safety warnings while driving and give us a basic 250+ mile SUV that works for under $35,000
I hope they succeed, competition drives innovation
do it
"Driving Aids" yup its exactly what it sounds like.
Looks like a mix between many Renault... (Megane/ Austral).
"you cant switch lanes if your blinker is not on" should be a feature of new bmw's...
If you are driving below 60km/h, you can change lanes without turning on your turn signals. Also, if you are going over 60 km/h, the car will not let you change lanes if you don't have your turn signal on. This is an automatic feature of Vinfast vf8.
Would love to see if the update fixes anything.
Wait! Is that the first time we see James's hair? @13:11?
Terrible video. Too much talking
i like how theyre doing right by the client and offering a compensation incentive based on the types of issues.. american manufacturers should take notes and consider applying the same concept.
Bruh those chimes would have me raging lol.
You know what the real issues with modern cars are?   Shitty drivers that shouldn't be driving...   (Not these guys, just in general)
I wonder how over the air updates will deal with the sus suspension. Unless it's one of those "Bose electric suspension", I foresee a trip to the dealer.
is this the Yugo for the 2020s?
I always take car reviews on youtube or magazines as a joke. Alot of these kiss ass channels are sponsored by the big boy carmakers. In the end I'll decide if I like the car or not. I wont ever take youtube as a reason not to buy a car...especially Donut media. How about letting a subscriber take the car for the week.
In Vietnam the roads are full of motorscooters, so the paranoid bleepers and acceleration delay might make more sense in it's natural environment. Granted, it was a big oversight for export models, but you could do a Vietnam episode, and also check out some popular bikes here, the traffic in Saigon is pretty crazy.
I'd love to see this exact same car a year later. Bet nothing will change tho
Near the end of the video, I was just thinking that Vinfast is turning their buyers into beta testers, just like some companies in the video game industry... and then James pulls out the reference to No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk 2077. Mind blown.
Death trap, just missing a PS4 controller to drive it...hope gets better after the "software update".
Try driving my piece of shit Subaru outback, 2022. With the eyesight enabled, I bet I get four or 500 warnings over at six or 7 Hour drive.
All these complaints wouldn't be that bad, if the car didn't cost 50k
1,126 comments and I stopped at 2 minutes when they couldn't figure out how to start a car, which sounded similar to all other decent cars.  Is it clickbait, or do they want a hundred unnecessary steps?
Nice to see Nolan is a fan of COFFIN FLOP
Imagine my excitement with an automaker that has VIN in it's name. Imagine my disappointment to find out it's nauseating. The battery subscription is sus to me anyway.
Why is this car so expensive in the US?!
Ha! Nolan has a Coffin Flop shirt!!!
CEO gotta go
I'm so sick of cars like these being referred to as SUVs. They are NOT SUVs. They are Crossovers and are nothing but tall passenger cars.
that car is the beginning of what they want for all electric vehicles....to control if you can drive, how you can drive, and when you can drive.
In the defense of the blinkers and the drive aid being odd, I’ve been to Vietnam and firstly, they don’t observe lanes in the cities. It’s literally a “good luck to ya free for all” so you need the signals to continue for awhile. Secondly, the chimes & drivers aid might be sensitive as to be aware of the small motorbikes which FAR exceed the amount of cars on the roads there. If I’m not mistaken Vietnam has more motorbikes on their roads than anywhere else in the world. Cool video! Keep ‘em up!
YOU GUYS FORGOT TO DO ROLLING ON THE LIST $G$😎✌️🤘👍
Aren't there standards on these many safety issues? Isn't there an agency that says: Yeah this car is minimally competent and not inherently confusing?
Me before video: haha americans hate because its Vietnamese  After video: nevermind then...
Best part was tracking how the whiteboard items kept changing, and the random order in which they were filled.  4:44  Sunroof is next. 4:46 Sunroof is gone, Driver Aids have already failed 5:32 Sunroof is back, chimes are un-bad, no driver aids. 6:09 Chimes and aids are bad again, no sunroof.
A BMW driver will never be able to drive this car.
james your hair is too good to wear hats so often. nolan (also great hair) gets the ratio about right.
3 things; James didn't say "I love you " at the end and I'm offended :( , that's what his hair looks like?  I've never seen him without a hat lol, yes you need to do an update :D
6:13 imagine if you are trying to avoid a rear end from stopped traffic? The car won’t let you change lanes in an emergency, you have to remember to signal in an emergency!
is this payback to America for the war? 😭😭💀
Update
it looks somewhat like a Dacia duster from the front, and some Renault from the back
Americans have pretty good experience with Vietnamese death trap I guess ☠️
This is hilarious because there's a lot YouTubers who were paid to come out to their factory and post hype videos. Really exposes a lot of the BS those YouTubers were saying back then.
Why don't you guys do automotive education content any more?
electric lol, they will fail.
Editor really want some salary raise with all the goofy ahh sound effects 💀
Do an update in 3 months of 3 different cars
Imagine using you blinker instinctively instead of not using your blinker like a dickhead🤔
Who looks at a tesla, and is like no. I want to pay the same money for a crappy 3rd world country made start up p.o.s. 😅
Just dont get it period lol
I mean, it not surprise that is 'suck'. However, I still respect the company. They shown the commitment and intension to make this brand be a thing. We can see from the way they reach out, and the 'throwing money' just to beg user to keep using their product Vietnam, you grow very fast, and some time it might be too rushed, but keep going (from TH). South Korea has been through this phrase, Kia and Hyundai was also considered a sht car, look at them now.  Waiting for "Did Vinfast fix their issues", both from the channel and Vinfast  P.S. I won't be using it now cause of the...you know, and it still ugly, sorry lol. VF6 render kinda sick tho, I'm still be cheering for you guy.
Some of these issues wouldn't necessarily be a problem UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. Like, why would you want to accelerate quickly, drive without a seatbelt on, or change lanes without signaling first? Thats just being a bad driver. However. In an emergency situation, you may need to do those things. It's important to be able to swerve out of your lane to avoid objects or cars that stop too suddenly, accelerate quickly when someone is about to rear end you, or escape from a stalker or something and put on your seatbelt after you're safely away from them.
I drove a 2023 Camry that fought me as I tried to change lanes also 😅 I think optimizing features per driver will help each driver, all features are not for everyone.
"we have been making cars for over 100 years, just make it work like a car"  if only car companies were using this design philosophy
You know she only lent you the vehicle so she could claim $900 back on the issues you experienced. More profit than Toro!
Volkswagon...
Just another Tesla, piece of crap EV
Do people not test drive their cars before they buy it? Before someone bought one of these they should have noticed the incessant chiming, shit ride, laggy pedal, and for most people, even the invasive and faulty driving assists, cause you know, most people don't use their turn signals. Kinda hard to feel sorry for these owners, kinda like diving to the bottom of the ocean in a plastic water bottle, they did it to themselves lmao.
James you are looking amazing great job you look slim!
Personally I’d love to see a follow up.
Vinfast brought the x General Motors proving ground and hired a heap of Australian engineers (GM) to develop car. Then sold up and sacked all. Claiming it was 2 expensive to develop.
My condolences to Natalie.
Why do Americans call them blinkers? They're turn signals :p
Followuuuuuuuup!
“Al the annoying things about EVs and none the cool stuff “ …. 😂  real
Vinfast: You must signal before the steering wheel will let you change lanes The deer running out into the highway: *Now no one can stop me*
So basically the car is it's own backseat driver.
Happens when mfs think money will fix everything instead of sound logic and reasoning
What a laughably terrible car 🤣 Regarding the epilogue: it sounds like an auto maker needs feedback on their cars, and wants to outsource to some American car gurus who really know their stuff . . . they view you guys as an invaluable tool . . . I suggest you agree to review another of their cars, but this time it should be for a price -- of course, keep the review unbiased; just think of it as them paying for your services of automotive review so they can improve their car! Win-Win-Win!
This is a lot like earlier batches of the Ola S1 Pro..
Definitely AIDS is bad
Now do the cannonball run with it
I hate when people don't put on their blinkers
Imagine making a 50 grand electric car without keyless entry... especially a car where the fob is useless except for opening the car
I’ll just stick to gas powered vehicles.
13:03 it true however, in Vietnam there are not many Options in addition to electric cars Vinfast and cars are taxed very high, very expensive prices
Car bricks on the highway and they want the owner's first thought to be - "Sweet! 300 more bucks in my pocket!"
It seems like they just have an overall quality control problem
As a vietnamese, i’m proud that we have a legitimate car manufacturer that stand up for their own words. Domestically, they have gas powered vehicles that doing pretty decent, we saw them on road all the time, never heard of any reliability issue and the engine makes some good power too. But they are definately rushing on the EVs market despite of having none experience on EVs market. They have electric scooters, i heard they are quite decent. But electric cars, we only saw them on the road as a taxi for their own taxi brand here in Vietnam. But still, i think they should experiment more on domestic market more than rushing to bring the brand globally or just improve their gas-powered cars for import. After all, Vinfast this time made wrong decision this time. Wish them the best in the future and make Vinfast as a heavy weight competitors to other huge brand in the world.
pretty sure a software update isnt gonna fix the shitty suspension that makes u sick ir the shit turning radius. its sad that someone actually paid 50K for this
They look so nausea by the end of the video lol
redo it with the update
Vinfast sounds like an Indian scammer company. Why would you buy a car from them?!?
Why not get a real car, tired of this electric crap being tossed around all the time.
Now there is G-Dam "Early Access Cars"  hmmmm, seems correct !
Big shoutout to Vinfast for responding to your video review and addressing the concerns raised by you guys. That’s a legit company for following Donut Media!
Yay, James. Please adopt me!
I didn’t even know of this company lmao
Most new cars have those annoying chimes and driving aids!! If you go into the cars settings you can adjust it all to your liking.
Nolan knew instantly how to start the car but just let James spin his wheels out of respect lol
The start up is the same thing as Tesla
You changed the board from “Sunroof” to “Drive Aid”… WHATS WRONG WITH THE SUNROOF?!?
Id love to see an update!
13:10 This looks like a completely different person
james is ruthless
I wonder if there’s a one second delay on the airbags too.
Why does the guy in the hat look like my grandfather has eaten people when he takes his hat off.
I know exactly how that 100 buck on the 4th day stuff willl play out. 3th day you get the car back, the day after it will be broken again. They will rush the repair jobs like mofo i guarantee it.
china
This car is giving me a tick LOL
Vinfast? that sounds like someone watched Vin Diesel on F&F and decided to merge those names together
This reminded me of the Yugo from the 80's. It was mocked for being light, so that you could push it to a garage to get fixed!
Cyberpunk at launch was a great game, I never had a problem with it
Or maybe yall are just prissy
"Just make a car that's electric. Don't make it all weird!" 100%, wish that was a thing from any company.
Lets see if there updates are worth anything! Do an update review!
what is the name of the car "Vinfu.k"
😊😊😊😊😊😊
Would be great to see what the fixes actually fix.
Surprise it’s not the Chevy traverse/ GMC Terrain.
check it... facts ... no words 😁
I do enjoy you guys. I'd like to do a road trip, maybe Cannon Ball, just for the fun, not speed/time :)
at 8:00 the tesla on the side looks like its sliding on the road xD
Fair shake it
You never want to hear, "Thank you, we're sorry." after someone reviews your new car.
Re do it
What's with the disappearing sunroof/drive aid category throughout the video? Lol
Does the brake pedal have a 1 or 2 second hesitation too?  Yeah check them out again in the future and see what happens. They probably bought a good E car and copied it and that is how you get a car on the market in 1 year and then spend 2 or 3 years working out the bugs. Suspension needs help BADLY.
Just body after body busting out of shit cars and hitting pavement.
I think you should try cars from EU which was not seller in US
smart cars are dumb
Thanks vinfast for sponsoring this video
Most cars pull you for lane assist these days
Let’s see updates give them a chance?👍🍻🇨🇦
Yes, I really want to see fixed one
damn, I wish the Emily GT created in 9 months by ex-SAAB engineers were in production instead of these.
BMW drivers punching the air cause they cant switch lanes without using a blinker.
Looks good though
How about Just make a normal car with an engine? Lithium will be close to depleted by 2030 and people would go back to good ol combustion engines.
Americans are just salty with their reviews due to the embarrassment the Vietnamese caused them once. Now taking it out on a car from Vietnam is quite a low blow. Obviously, those gremlins VinFast has will get fixed over time. It's a product that was launched in a matter of 5 years from its inception. So give it a break. Even products from Ford, GM, and other American brands have issues as they leave the showroom floor.
Damn good!!! I am sad that bad lier reviewer appeared in Motor Trend. It's better to test it ourself 😂😢
I'm too young to have experienced it but I imagine this is how Hyundai was when they first started making cars. They did borrow tech from Mitsubishi and Lotus so maybe not as bad as this but they also didn't have to deal with all this crazy tech and high expectations. Give them oh...20 years and they'll be fine hahaha
The only thing wrong with this car is the price tag, it should be around 20k
All about second chances...well not really for electric cars. They just enrich China and weaken America, just like Joe Biden wants to,happen because he,is getting rich from it and then his government cronies just blindly cheer on whatever he says. So yeah, review the car again, it's what your deranged governor wants too. How can the people of California not see how the taxes are so high and the criminal problem so bad, especially the homeless issue, and you alll still support this?
Mostly the Viet people that hate the car
Must be a horror show if it's compared to Cyberpunk 2077.
Imagine you're coming up to a turn near a cliff, but the blinkers don't work so you can't switch lanes and you end up driving off the side.  This car can go wrong in so many ways...
It's like when journalists killed the Suzuki in the USA.
Did I miss why you removed the sunroof test you has listed early on? Cameras a problem since they were stuck to it?
Why would I buy this when I can get a '23 Highlander hybrid XLE for less money, without needing all the fixes to work properly
"Just make a car that's electric powered"...   Fuck yeah... Imagine how much less EVs would cost if they weren't also your laptop, xbox, cell phone, and home entertainment system.
Electric cars are awful. A lot of people WILL regret them.
Those guys are stupid ? Dont event know how to review a car?
68 seconds to get moving like a PoleStar? C'mon guys!!
New review plz
Well alright, they might have given a software update but I’d imagine a bunch of cars are still in that factory state. I guess we will just wait and see if they’re future cars get better
Words cannot describe how embarrassed I would be driving this car in public.
@6:10 yes! more cars need this feature!!! My tesla does tug the wheel when i drift into nearby lane, but if i switch lanes more aggressively without signaling, it doesnt catch it always...
If Natalie lets you drive it again. Give it 6 months and see if they fixed the issues.
The driving corrections for not using blinkers def should be in all cars especially bmws
How nice of them to let people alpha test their vehicle for them.
That's communism in a car. If someone is stopped on the free way, or there is a deer, or something on the road you cant even swerv to advoid it. You cant even start it without a seatbelt😂
Would’ve loved a statement from the owner! Love to think what she thinks.
Since when does James have such grey hair 0.o
Im sorry, but my equinox was 35k, and i would gladly take it over this thing...
I'd be keen to see y'all give the VinFast another shot after the bugs have been coded out.
For one thing, why is it that AMrican men cant read a manual. When I buy a car, I take the manual everywhere. Its my NEW CAR! I enjoy reading eveyrthing about it. How long have these yoyos been driving? They act like they just got out of DriversEd. I think most of these ssues are probably covered in the manual. I like the car. It looks nice. But I havent driven it. These clowns had it made up in their pointed heads that "we are not gonna like it
Yes, please. I'd love to see an update on the car after the updates.
Like a Fast movie, please continue the saga that is reviewing the VinDieselFast8.
12:36 hey man don't ever disrespect No Mans Sky, it's amazing
Seems like a car should be tested enough prior to release to find these issues
This is great. Shows us that generic brand cars are not just around the corner, but they are here! And just like generic cereal, they’re sometimes alright but mostly only adequate. Donut should try to develop their own truly generic car through third party assemblers, and call their brand;  Car. Make it Beige too.
Nolan's Coffin Flop shirt... gimmie that!
FAIR SHAKE FAIR SHAKE FAIR SHAKE!!!!! In seriousness though, I'm curious if they were able to fix it with an update, it's a car company I've never heard of but I'd rather have another successful electric car company than another failed one. You've got my vote to have it come back.
Blind spot assistance is silly. If you actually know how to set up your blind spot mirrors (incorrectly called "side view" mirrors), then there is NO blind spot. But, as is typical, 99% of drivers have no clue how to set them up properly. I have mine set on my car, and I have no blind spot.
Well, if Vinfast wants to be as successful as NMS and CB77 on their road to redemption, they'll have to make kick ass DLCs on top of bug fixes!
So they have a system in place in which you're given $100 for a complaint on the vehicle, no wonder it has the most negative reviews possible. Even if they're completely justified negative reviews, that doesn't help their company outlook for other customers looking in.
That's the speed of business, Don't write a check your ass can't cash. You say it's releasing a certain time you got a deadline you gotta do everything in your power to meet that deadline with a quality product. Cyberpunk is a great example was a shit game at launch and got written off because of it, nobody plays it now. Especially being a new kid on the block company you wanna out do the big guys you gotta be better. Your first car in north america cost that much and is that crappy YOU LOST. After this review nobody gonna pay this much when you can get an established brand for the same price
Y'all should come pare it to a Tesla model 3 performance
At least the steering wheel doesn’t fly off when you’re driving
12:!2: Filling in the green check box with the red marker has that "task failed successfully" energy
I’m watching this video because Cyberpunk 2077 just crashed on me.  If this car has the same track record of having “most of the bugs” ironed out, I’d find a way to throw the steering wheel across the car like my controller just experienced.
No thanks.  Just no.
of course short VINFAST ! :)) its vietnamese and we as a vietnamese we know it is not good, and someone say it good they are rich or son or daughter of official from vietnam
give it a fair shake...updates can fix everything .............maybe
this is just because I have a big dislike for EV's of all types..... I hate it
MSRP OF $46 GRAND WTF?????? Anyone that buys this has something wrong in the head lol
Do we really need another generic crossover?
Vietnam cars are just slightly worse than chinese cars. We shouldnt be selling any of them here cause they are terrible
Eww. It looks like a budget Dacia Sandero or Renault 🤣
it chimes to make sure you haven't jumped out of it yet
Kind of makes you appreciate what Tesla has built when you see so many startup EV companies struggle and fail
Chinese cars have been scrutinized for years when trying to sell in the US, and Vinfast was able to export to the US in a year since the company was founded??? You call the USA a non-corrupted country?
Seems a $30k car at best. And that's with a working blind spot/ accelerator pedal and steering that let's you change lanes without having to indicate(like swerving to avoid a head on crash)
Would love to see more EVs on the channel
Got to drive one of the pre-production models at the Toronto auto show earlier this year
They are trying to release the car the same way game developers are doing it. Release now fix later
James: Thank you, we’re sorry.
So the start up is stupid and here's why....depending on the climate, you're either gonna start your car and go back inside till the interior is at the comfortable temp. If my car is 110 degrees inside....I absolutely do not want to do all that bullshit just to get right back out, cause I want to cool my car off.
“On the forth day ill start giving you 100$” hahah😂
Nobody would bother stealing that car in GTA 5. Just saying...
I mean stomping on the accelerator for half a second and then taking the foot off isn't much of a test.
This car would never ever EVER be road legal in germany.
VinGay
"This is the kind of company that throws money at problems" TOO DAMN TRUE, They gotta get their sht together if they don't want to fail
Why would someone buy this thing over a EV6 is beyond my comprehension
I hate the car, I hate the fact that you're covering the piece of crap on your channel, but, I like the heck out of all you guys  😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope they go bankrupt for releasing such a dangerous and unreliable product
Those safety equipment issues just make me appreciate my focus rs so much more. A modern car and has no stupid stuff to tell me how to drive or try and drive for me
Man this is the kinda car that makes me miss the OLD Top Gear...sniff we will never get to see those old fellas rip into this thing.
We all know what Nolan really meant when he said people are…sensitive 😏
Give it another chance in a few months!
Definitely do an "updated" review!!
If u have a spouse that u hate. Gift them this car🎉
Did I just watch 12 minutes of a car video to get a cyberpunk and no mans sky comparison 😭
What I find particularly insulting is that this costs 50k. That’s good BMW money. This feels like it was put together with the care of a cheap economy car and for 50k that just can’t happen.
If I'm understanding corrrectly... So your on the motorway and try to avoid an accident without indicating... It forces you to crash! Wow!
What happened to all of the hrsprs merch? I've been wanting to get some but I cant find any on the donut website.
Absolutely
I understand the cyberpunk/no man's sky comparison but i feel like you didn't stress the difference in a $70 video game and a $50k vehicle that people are actively driving on roadways. If a game's shit then it just sucks for whoever bought it. But if a car's shit it could suck for everyone that bought it and everyone else on the roads.
Vinslow?
Didn't they test this peace of shit before they released it.
Nice JoJo reference
are they also funded/r&d by EA? This sounds like an EA. im just waiting for them to charge for updates to cover the cost of fixing this. Season Pass Paid DLC safety updates subscription.
I’ve been sat in the back seat while making a friend test drive it. Pretty normal car. The interiors are funky which I liked about it.
How did this pass safety testing
I can’t believe it’s $50,000.
That bouncy section of the 405 is absolutely ridiculous, my long wheelbase expedition can’t smooth that out. I drove it in a rental car a few months back, and actually pulled to the shoulder to change what I thought was a flat tire. Nope, the road is just that bad. It’s hard to believe actual adults were present and signed off on that when it was done. “Our tax money at work,” completely botched, in the middle of the biggest city of the 5th largest economy on earth.
It's really sad how we're getting to the point where we can compare real life cars to videogames. You release it with a bunch of crappy problems and then fix those problems with software updates throughout the life of the thing.
Cyberpunk is so good now
I vote 1 year re-review
I’m half Vietnamese, so I’ll give Vinfast the benefit of the doubt. They’re the first carmaker from Vietnam(where my mom is from, n thus where I trace my ethnicity) so I wanna buy one in the future.   Gotta stop being broke and in college first tho lmaooo
Problem with appliances or cars when they have such flaws, is that they stick into the customer's minds, hence your reputation (or your attempt to create one) is dead. Hopefully they can work those bugs out but it will be a hard one to change people's mind once they have saw such junky car disappointing reviewers all day long...
2:14 I agree with nolan
50k, let that sink in
10:59 This car might feature in horrior movie😂
please check in with vinfast later.
Yeah do it again,  what do you mean, maybe we will.? Of course you will ...you cant just drop this opportunity 😅
Might be the first time I’ve seen James hair in a video 😂
Shoulda vin a $19,000  car..
Its a shuttle vehicle that's legal on the highway basically   A good pricing would be about 28K because falls short in comparison to a Ford Bronco in every category.
I appreciate the effort you all put forward at Donut to be transparent, even with the short update at the end.  Definitely revisit it, and I second  what others are saying with testing the same car but with the over-the-air update(s)
a lot of these startup EV companies are treating cars as software. Beta testing and over the air updates are fine in software but not a 5000lb hunk of metal responsible for your life. There may need to be increased regulation around stuff like this.
We live in an age where you have to compare cars to video games XD
Vin diesel would be proud knowing there's a car brand named after him together with his movie fast and furious
They need to give these to everyone in Memphis Tennessee. It would make everyone drive better.
I saw this car being presented at a mall  in Canada a few months ago. I was asking some questions to the guys representing vinfast. When I said the interior kinda looked like Mazda they got visibly triggered. One of the guys immediately clapped back with "We were thinking more like Mercedes" Dude what.
If this was Tesla they would be on Twitter shit talking the drivers.
😱
1:05 Ditch the fisheye lens, it's horrible and useless
Follow up, heck yeah
Did anyone else notice that the table behind them had SUNROOF as the 4th test. Then on 3rd chime it's replaced with DRIVE AID, which curiously is already marked in red?
❤ Toyota Corolla GR ❤️
Looks like a Hyundai Tuscan, super cheap and npc looking design, there’s no convincing me this thing is worth 50k 💀 Part of what makes the ev cars cool is their road appearance given they don’t need space for a motor and large cooling system. Not to mention all ev cars drive the same except for the Porsche Tycan, so styling is a must for market differentiation.
Looks pretty smart tho
That startup actually benefits you. hijacker trying to steal your car but don't know how to start the car😂
are we gonna start to get early access cars now? xD FML
Having traveled to Vietnam end of last year, These were everywhere, I think they look pretty good. Everyone I talked to there about it talked shit on them and the company behind it.
It might be a funny amount of money but I don't see Tesla giving people cash when their car is busted.
Who the hell would let them sell cars in America? lol.. and we can't have older GT-R's etc because the glass isn't safe?
Would buy 10/10 😂
A lot of these issues can be overlooked if this was a $30-$35K car, but the fact that it's the same price as a Mach-E is egregious
James mentioning the fails of Cyberpunk and No Mans Sky back to back definitely means he's an Internet Historian fan. Gotta love it.
Hey Nolan you're dumb and wrong for saying that start sequence isn't a big deal. Thx love you 💕
Lmao just so u know any car sold in 2021-2023 has probably had 1 loss of motive recall. So technically it could’ve happened to u regardless of this vehicle in the video. Hopefully ur up to date on ur recalls.
Don't fall for these cheap quality new ev startups
I definitely want to see a follow up.
Can you shut the chimes off
Make a update video how can we believe????
I just bought a 2023 kia sorrento, most bells and whistles I've ever had in a car. But let me tell you the warning chimes are out of control. I was in a drive through and it kept going off it was going nuts. Not a fan at all of all these warnings, they're taking all the work out of driving cars people are going to forget how to use their eyes to see if something or someone is in the way
12:37 But those are games and can't harm anyone but a Car NEED to work, life is involved completely different things
Rented an audi 2 weeks ago. All the warnings made it terrible.
Make a video on how it is fixed seemed suspicious
Do an update
It may be vinfast, but is it Vin Diesel fast?
Any other Naruto fans recognize the noise at 11:11?
James, how is your dad Matt doing?
We live in a weird time that we can compare cars to video games... But the analogy is completely valid, actually it's almost scary/depressing how accurate of a comparison it is
Bro, I'm from Vietnam and it is great
Uhhhh I can get a Honda SI for like 50k or another maybe a used type r honda or toyota that will not fall apart or kill me in a fire. Chinese electric cars burn way more than any country car made anywhere else in the world. Do not by chinese cars, obviously.
Start up was foot on brake hit drive? Sounds pretty standard.
It makes me realize how old my car is when I didn’t realize it was an annoyance to have to manually turn off your blinker after a lane change.
Not being able to turn without turn signals, finally something for bmw drivers 😂😂
its a chinese renault
I would like to see it reviewed again with updates. 👍
Another awesome episode, thanks Donut! I'm still waiting for JUSTICE FOR JERRY!!! tho
The 2023 Toyota Highlander has many of these issues. The lame assist is annoying and hard to turn off. It constantly chimes and beeps. This car might just be a clone of a highlander
Where's Jobe?!
yeah....  even making a good smartphone is hard. imagine having boldness to ask 50 k for car that is dangerous to drive
Their service is pretty good though for real
VinFast vs other obscure Asian cars
Being a trucker, who drives a manual transmission semi on the 405 freeway in LA and owns a 2003 wrangler manual transmission I see this vinfast electric “suv” as literally every single thing that is wrong with new cars these days. Whatever happened to the human actually DRIVING the machine? Smh
I was not expecting a No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk reference here. But if this company can pull a No Man's Sky would be amazing
I actually like that start up sequence. Takes a lot of basic stupidity out of drivers 🤣
I wanna see an update video.
i would actually like to see an update on the car after the update
Omg. If you don't signal...it literally won't change lanes???? That is beyond enraging. A car that doesn't go where you want? Ye gods and little fishes.
Who in their right mind would buy this😂
Every car when they first come out has bugs. At least they are software related and an easy fix with updates
Vietnam’s revenge is looking wild
It doesn't live up to expectations is unfair . It was expected to suck and it did .
VW's ID-3 EV was an absolutely disastrous launch. They built thousands of new cars that couldn't be delivered to customers for months because the software just wasn't usable. Then of course is the 100% Chevy Bolt recall, every single Bolt ever made was recalled to have their batteries tested and repaired, complete disaster... nevermind how well GM has demonstrated big talk of their EV leadership and have had a continuous failure to launch new EVs as promised. The new Cadillac Lyriq EV looks to be a complete sales disaster for GM. Vinfast has been more successful than their competition than you are willing to give them credit for.
Fair review! Love Donut!
Guys, do more new car reviews. I love your honesty!!
It's just a sign of the Chimes....
How does this garbage even get approved for the road lol
So no Submarine jokes?
My 2019 Civic has the lane keep assist that pulls it back into the lane if I don't use my blinker to change lanes. Its annoying and I constantly fight with it.
This reminds me of my trip to Laos this vehicle style is very much cloned by many other brands when it rained the car was undrivable chimes and the steering wheel was turned by itself almost into other traffic
Its not hard to attach a motor to batteries expect many more of these unknown car manufacturers popping up with rubbish cars
Make a hellcat a fuel efficient car like a hyoermiler
Part 2👍🏻
Okay, I get it. But....anyone who is downright moronic enough to pay 50k for a "VINFAST" deserves every bit of they're in for, and I don't feel the least bit bad for them.
Vin number
I saw one in the SF Bay Area with a Michigan license plate a few weeks ago.  In general, never go for anything that is first generation.
Fair shake that VF8 🚗
I am definitely curious to see if this car can pull off a redemption arc.
Of all the companies for Vinfast to emulate or take inspiration from, it should not ever been "Late 70s Dodge". That spring rate is especially heinous. The lax accelleration is a software issue most likely.
Why would anyone buy this piece of crap
Vroom vroom bby.
Maybe try it on the back roads next time.  Bring your helmets  🪖!
Never enter a new market with problems
Vinfast? Vinfurious 😉  Hotel? Trivago.
Give me an electric car but everything on the inside is analog except for power windows and mirror
Let’s see the updates
It should be ILLEGAL to have the combination of a "V" and a "8" in the name of an ELECTRIC car.
If you're going to destroy the environment to make electric cars, at least make them good. We don't need more tesla e-waste on the roads.
c'mon vinfast, i was rooting for the underdog. do better
12:50 Preach it. This is my biggest issue with EVs, on top of being insanely expensive. Fixing things that aren't broken and re-inventing the wheel. Tesla being the biggest offender.
if you buy this instead of a ioniq then is kinda on you
Tou better have said, absolutely! This is an embarrassment to the automobile community. I don’t care if it’s electric or not. It’s got four wheels and it can carry passengers so technically, it’s a car. I prefer fuel not battery powered probably because I’m poor but besides the point, I’d probably still prefer my older vehicles that I’m still able to buy parts for and work on myself.
The biggest issue I have with all this new technology is it takes away driving from the actual driver. For me, the only thing that has come out in recent years that has an actual safety use is blind spot monitoring. I tell the car what I want it to do, the car doesn't tell me what it wants to do.
If they went the Hyundai or Kia route and made their cars cheap to enter the US market and consumers dealt with the weird issues. Eventually Hyundai and Kia have listened to consumers and now have solid products they can charge more for.
You cant fix suspension through wifi 💀
aftersale patching is getting insane. Whats next? Medical Equipment?
I remember when Kia made their debut, them shits were buy one get and look at them now. It is hard to make it in the car Industry as well.
Vinfast fix
Please revisit the VF8 with the latest patches!
Bro they just casually roasted Natalie’s car🤣🤣
This reminds me of a Top Gear Quote "I chose Porsche because it brings on rectal prolapse"   This applies exactly to this car
In hindsight the checklist board was a bad idea considering all the required editing. And it’s driving my ADHD crazy
I already saw one of these on the road in Northern California, with actual owner plates, not temp or fleet or press plates! Someone actually was crazy enough to buy/lease one for themselves when it just released!
If Bethesda made a car.
No man's sky is still a bit buggy but they ended up putting together a pretty good game.   If this company has thr support hello games has then this might end up being a good car.
I didn't even know this car existed so... 1*
Do it again!  Also, make underground worthwhile. $7/mo for like 2 extra videos and some stickers is dumb
Toyota also has an awful lane assist that will jerk when you try to change lanes without signaling. My mother bought a new Toyota Corolla and called them to schedule maintenance it was jerking so hard and they told her “that’s just the lane assist, no worries.” So needless to say we turned that off as soon as we could figure it out for her.
I don’t ever want a car that needs updates. It should work from the factory and shouldn’t need any new features added later on.
I think it didn't accelerate cause you were in traffic when you were stomping on throttle pedal, or so it seemed from the video, maybe its a safety feature or you could clarify !
wow this dogshit plastic rolling vidgame really begs the question , just how much farther is all this electronic overkill gonna go?? 😮. imma keep FAR away from this toxic rubbish thank you
To be fair, a lot of blind spot monitors don’t start working until you reach a certain speed. Also Lane Keep in most cars will pull the vehicle back into the lane if you’re just lightly changing lanes without a blinker. There’s usually settings to change the sensitivity of the system or it’ll stop when it realizes you’re pushing through it.
My roommate had a 2022  4Runner and I swear when your driving it it’s perfect but when your in the passenger seat the car is so top heavy and bouncy it’s like being on a ship at sea it sways  and almost rocks back and fourth 😅 and I never get motion sick I will say we live in a busy area and I notice it more at lower speeds more than highway speeds
I don't see a problem with this car. Seems like it is designed around what the Vietnamese do best... Killing Americans...
The comparison to a video game is downright insulting to the consumer. Never buy on a promise. Gone are the days of buying a finished product. No, now you have to buy the broken product and wait for the manufacturer to potentially fix it. Prime example is bf2042. Hardly fixed at all. At least with my old beater car, I never have to worry about making sure my *car* is up to date. "___ as a service" business models are killing the consumer and we should be calling it out wherever it crops up.
Whether car journalists ignore major issues with cars depends entirely on how much the car companies wined and dined them during the launch. Safe to say, VW/Audi/Porsche wine and dine the hell out of them.
The main issue is that wltp range was 200 ish miles, they sold it in Asia like that. When they came to US, they had to do an EPA range, and it’s much more accurate for average drivers. They got 147 miles range. Which is horrible for even $20000 EV. It’s borderline unusable.
I would NEVER own a car with driving assist features. That's terrifying.
How does this compare to Tesla’s initial rollout of the S model?
Most people in the USA with even the tiniest lick of sense aren't going to buy a car built in Vietnam or any other Communist country anyway?
I rented a car this year Skoda Kodiaq 2022. With all the assists the car does not allow you to change lane too. I did not push to hard. I talked to some friends with newer cars from Volkswagen group. They say all newer models behave like that. I usually use turn signals every-time i make maneuvers, so it was not much of problem for me. Also you can disable all the assists. I don't know if it differs from Europe to the States.
For 50k you should get a 2 for 1 car special. One as backup car for the mechanic and the other to drive until you take it back to the mechanic.
Give'em a second chance.
If a car review ends with “thanks for lending us your car. We’re sorry” it sure isn’t the best of the lot :)
The Chevy Bolt also has some of these issues. I don't think GM did a good job with them.
You forgot one of the worst parts about this car, that $55k price tag does NOT include the battery.  You can buy it as a hyper expensive option, or lease a battery for a lot of extra money per month.  That one detail basically puts this car on the "do not buy list" all on it's own.
DAMPED. Fuck.
I would buy one of those if it came with dickass brakes.    Wait till you find out how they crash test them. They'll give you your surviving relatives 500
Switching lanes without blinkers is common, had it on my 2017 b8 Passat and 2020 Volvo v90. You just turn off Lane Assist
imagine making a car so terrible you have to compensate owners.
Do another update
The fact that you guys use some sound effects from my favorite gaming YouTubers sends me. The “DOO” with laggy throttle is so funny
Looking a little fat in that car lol
The words 'electronic power steering" should scare the crap out of you. It means your car itself or a hacker can decide to steer you into a tree at any time doing 100mph.
Imagine having a problem with your vehicle and the maker just tells you to download the latest software update to hopefully fix it. ...not sure how i feek about that.
how did the company know that you shoot a video on the car??
Damn, No Mans Sky and CyberPunk will forever be catching strays as the shit games upon release 😅 what a legacy
So what happens to R&D than? This issue should be done before they launch the bloody car..WTF
Yeah review it again. I'd watch it, for sure. I'd love to see how the company comes back and fixes mistakes.
A year ago they made a video about 2023 cars they were excited for and this was one of them if I remember right 😂
Funny how you say Cyberpunk 2077 was rushed when it took over 10 years to develop haha. That’s why people were so mad cuz they we’re talking about this game back in the 2010s and then we got it and it was bugged like a rotten log
Its great when Communist countries embrace capitalism. Oh Whoa Fat ( whatever) is worth 4.1 Billion in a socialist country. They still can't build cars worth anything. Look how long it took Korea to get their act together on cars. and they are not Leftist.
The misrake vinfast made was aelling the vehicle in america. In the future forget the american market. Teslas have a lot of issues but you will never hear american media highlighting them. Also porsche audis bmw and vw. Which other cars are more junk than those. The are problematic.
The acceleration lag on that car is hilarious 😂 any other ev I driven has been super responsive
No offense but chimes and driving aids are the same as my corolla
When you start comparing cars to rushed and unpolished games that took years to make playable that's a huge problem.
When Hyundai came to the states in the mid 80's their products suffered from quality issues compared to their rivals as they were relatively new at making cars. Up to that point they only had released one model back in 1974, the Pony and that car lasted until the mid 80's unchanged. Soon after they released the 2nd gen the Excel. So they had little experience with developing cars thus why the first Excels were pretty trash compared to their japanese and european rivals and even their American rivals.   Vietnam is still new at making cars so I am not surprised they are having trouble. With Hyundai it took many years before they made products on par with their rivals so I guess we can't fault Vinfasts growing pains.
Thanks for the video! Please do another review to see what they fixed or not!
“It’s not just fast…. It’s Vin fast” 😂
I had read a article where there was a gentleman that bought a vinfast over where they are built that gave it such a bad review and the company sued the man for the because they said that it was defimation of there company. I would be scared to death at this point in buying one of their vehicles.
Give em a chance, anyone old enough to remember the first Kia's and Hyundai's?  What about back to Saturn's launch?  They were rough I tell you.  Lexus did it very well, Infinity not far behind but they had all the cheat codes already.
James is unrecognizable without a cap 🧢
I want to see it on a camping trip with you all. With at least 1 recharge along the way
Do all these issues technically classify this car as a lemon or am I completely wrong?
Vietcong:"🤔 💡Levenge on Amelicans pho Viet*Nam Wahr. We sell them EB Kah."🤣😂🤣
I would like to see how much improvement there is after an update on software.  If the update is way beyond below expectations, then the question arises. How much  would it cost an owner to fix it with aftermarket help.
Car Reviews should be made at least with a Industrial Designer who actually knows about design
Can you do a review on the 125cc hawk pit bike.
I'm so glad a vinfast review was made , I now have to steer away this amazing looking car ... Cough cough
Mustang Mach e goes crazy
Imagine paying 50k for cyberpunk on release 😂
It's official, you can now buy a proper "Vacation" Movie car....
nah dude not being able to start the car without closing the door, putting on a seatbelt and pressing the break would be insanely annoying. What if only one of those sensors fail? Does the car just not start?
Make sure not to mention the Tesla Model Y at the beginning when you were listing the car it was competing with.
lets see a review of the updated version
Vietnams revenge for America invasion of their country. PAYBACK A B1TCH!
To be fair even tesla had major issues at the start, some that went on for years! Vingroup's Vinfast is relatively new to the car market and they deserve a second shot.
Color me surprised, commies don't make good cars?!
This car looks like a reanult isn’t it?
This car operates like a weiner that poops... Its just.... Wrong
The start up is just like any other ev, what are we talking about? lol
Dang that thing isn’t safe
HOW DO I TURN LAST ASSIST OFF in a 21 VW Passat?  I turn it off and next time I drive the car it’s back on. Like it has a reset.   There’s a reason it’s only got 20k miles on a car 2.5 years old. Shit drives me crazy. Especially in lanes where they repainted lines and I’m actually in my correct lane and it jerks me to the other lane I’m not supposed to be in. Damn Germans.
How the hell is the name not just ridiculed to oblivion?? Vin Fast? Is this a spin off movie series or something?
Finally, someone says it! the problem I have with EVs, that they either try to reinvent the wheel, try to be as boring and bland as possible, or both, little inbetween. I just want AN car, with decent looks, NORMAL functionality, but is electric. how hard is that.  I dont want an ipad glued to the dash, I dont want all these crazy future features. if it cant be done from a button or a knob i dont want it. and im tired of all of them looking ugly. though normal cars fall in this one too. cars have not looked good for the past 25 years, with very few outliers. EVs are even worse because they always try and make the looks more zany and weird to show hoq quirky and "different" the car is
No way would I trust this piece of garbage with my family and my life. Anyone who purchased this vehicle deserves sympathy.
Super ugly car, I don't even care if it works without problems, would never let myself be seen in souch a hideous thing!
Adjustable suspension and an off button  for chimes could work
And this is why I like older vehicles without so much as DRLs or autolights
Now you all know what it's like to drive a semi truck in 2023. Just a constant barrage of faulty chimes from a dozen different systems all fighting for your attention to warn you that you're "kinda close to the left side of your lane and should stay PERFECTLY IN THE CENTER OR YOU'LL DIE IN A LITHIUM FIRE AND BURN FOR ALL ETERNITY!"
The best update this company could make is to rename themselves “LoseQuick”.
I've never heard of a car company paying its customers when something doesn't function as it should on their cars, that's fantastic. All manufacturers should do that, they have no idea how their mistakes can cost consumers money by having to rent a car while their actual car is in the shop to fix the car company's problems. Also, didn't you look into the menu to turn off the excessive chiming?  I think it's great that there are new EV car companies that are coming to America so we can have more choices and hopefully that'll reflect in the prices. Like all early car companies, they have teething issues that they'll fix overtime like Tesla did, I just hope this doesn't turn into a Suzuki Samurai hit piece that killed a fairly enjoyable car that was given an unfair shake at the market.
I mean, credit where credit is due, the Vinfast company itself was a miracle.   For a country that doesn't believe in cars, it's amazing that a Vietnamese company could just hammer out a car in less than a year and its drivable. Granted, it has tons of flaws but for it to be able to even move under its own power itself was amazing regardless of the scathing reviews and poor ergonomics and reliability.
Seems worthwhile to give them a chance to show they’re trying to fix the problems.
I’m watching in real-time the word “nauseous” become the word “nauseated.” They will 100% mean the same thing within the next 20 years, and we got to see it happen.
I remember Hyundai and Kia were also abysmal on first release in the US. Something tells me in 5-10 years these Vinfast cars will be on par with everything else on the road.
That no lane switch thing is really dangerous, it could detect a diagonal line in the road at a corner and steer you off the road
It's not competing with cars like that. It's competing with Tesla. That's the only car anyone is competing against.
Next car will be the DieselFurious 🤦🏻‍♂️
As a walker, I am actually SUPER HAPPY it wont let you change lanes without a signal on, I know it dosent apply to low speed driving, but anything that forces drivers to use signals is very welcome. It is the worst thing about being outside a car, just zero idea what the psycho meatbag inside is going to do, and they have all they ability to let you know, but they don't, psychos.  The video game analogy was great, Made total sense. Also love the recent DnB additions.
At least they good at makin deathtrap like this one😂
VIN-FAST? FFFAAAMILY???
Even the stitching on the headrest looks terribly done
the start up is just like tesla lmao
This is a knock off of a RENAULT french car makers, at the exterior
Imagine if more companies start to sell you "early access" cars - it's bad enough with the games!
Start-up and start moving in a porsche is far more complicated, a button on the left AND the park brake also its a button on the left...
VinFast don't make their cars look futuristic because they want to target the customers who switch from ICE cars to EVs. They want their cars to look familiar and easy to adapt for these people, even their regenerative braking function not so "regenerative" and also the exterior which designed by Pininfarina - a very famous design company, VinFast actually told Pininfarina to design the VF8 like this because this is what they want :D, futuristic style is unnessary for EVs, some people prefer the old fashioned style. If you want a futuristic model, check out the VF7 on their website, again, the thought that EVs are supposed to be futuristic is absolutely inappropriate
I see nobody mentioned it but GTA Online style ahh wheel, honetsly im not even kidding 😂
Vinfast is mostly made for people is its home country. Like the highways are way smaller than the us so it works way worse than others, the suspension is made bouncy because of the endless potholes in small street. And yes im vietnamese so I know what I'm saying
Turn signals
@10:20 to be fair people are buying teslas to fond out they dont have working heaters and they cant be foxed by tesla cause of a massive backlog of cars needing a new heater core, and issues charging at THEIR charging terminal in the winters
Wait 6 months or a year before doing a follow up, I'm interested in how the actual hardware of the car holds up.
Sorry Natalie.
This would be an ok car if it was very cheap. Like if it was 30% less than anything else in its class.
I believe a couple of years ago in Vietnam, Vinfast took an owner to the police because they made claims that Vinfast claimed were “untrue”. I guess they backed-tracked and are now listening to complaints.
Customers should be beta testers basically. Not good
The ready light was on for most of that first sequence
Put an electric car in a pool and see if it doesn’t blow up 😂😂
I remember I saw one of these at the New York auto show last year and once I saw it, I thought "This is going to be a piece of hot garbage" and It wasn't even just the build quality it was also the fact that Vinfast was advertising a monthly subscription service for its fast charging.
Follow-up idea: Leave it at the dealer until it's perfect, and call it "How to turn a $50k outlay into a $36,500/yr salary." You'll be up to your elbows in dong, tax free!
I don’t know about anybody else, but I always disable any and all “driver assist” functions in any car I drive. Lane assist promotes lazy driving. Emergency brake assist has almost caused an accident for me multiple times when passing vehicles. No sensor can determine my intentions while driving and that’s scary as fuck IMO.
I don't want car manufacturers to turn into video game makers *releases car "Yes I know the car isn't even drivable right now but don't worry we are working on the updates" 1 month later, your resale value on the car you can barely use, if at all has tanked and you spent 50k on a vehicle that isn't reliable enough to get you back and forth to work. But hey guys "they are working on it"
it's nice to see James in videos again, Cars are pain is a nice hat!
Even if it is fixed, I still don't like the god awful trend from video games of releasing a completely broken, incomplete product and then promising to fix it later. Seeing that as well as subscription garbage spread to cars is just annoying
Why would anyone roll the dice on a new car brand that has numerous issues and without a dealer network that could support it? Teslas are a nightmare to repair and they're the most common electric car, imagine how difficult getting parts for an offbrand Vietnamese EV would be.
Nolan's Coffin Flop shirt is amazing.
Communists trying to build cars. Lols  ever seen the ussr’s offerings?
Who would spend 50k on this junk when you could get a well known brand car?
Give this car to Top Gear, they won't have to make up a script of problems
This car is every BMW drivers worst nightmare…using something that doesn’t exist and when you don’t use it you can’t turn or switch lanes
Just started off the vidjea but just off its looks and the price alone for a new brand trying to enter a hot market idk.
I guess the biggest question would be how did this pass our highway safety laws automobile safety laws etc... Would that be because our current administration is purposely trying to do us harm... I mean they're quick to tell people to make a recall but yet they'll put us in the position to buy a vehicle that obviously they should know is not up to par! I guess that would go along with their policies though right or death more pain more suffering as long as it's not them in their family and friends
More reviews!
$50K is way too high for a paid public beta. No Man Sky and Cyber Punk don't have a legit chance to kill you, when they bug out. I'm surpised they aren't getting more pressure from the department of transportation.
This is the worst thing about new cars and especially EVs… Software updates! The upside to software updates is so much of a product can be improved with the update. BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS it enables manufacturers to release products or features earlier than they should and use our money and time to do the testing, because they’ll “fix it with an update.” Instead of properly testing and QAing, these companies just kick products out the door prematurely, start collecting money, then use that money to finish the product. And it’s one thing to be the early adopter of a video game and get updates… But that practice shouldn’t be applied to large, expensive vehicles that if not working properly become death traps. No one dies when a video game needs an update.
That car seems like a 20k car. Anyone who buys it for 50k is just throwing away money.
As someone who's viet, I def think this is expected.
That driving aid that makes it so you have to put your turn signal on before changing lanes, bmw drivers need that asap.
It looks better than that ridiculous mach-e but its still an suv so its stupid
A manufacturer giving people money back for a repair!?! You made fun of it, but sounds better than getting ripped off by the stealership service department...
All starts are difficult and it could be worse: it could be a new 400k Ferrari that overheats on its test drive, TWICE.
The Vin numbers for these cars will be vin diesel quotes from 2fast2furious
Watching this review reminded me of the high points of Top Gear, which is about the strongest compliment I can think to give.
Been watching donut for years and just now saw James' hair for the first time at the 13:13 mark. Honestly wasn't even sure he had any
So you tested a late 2010's Mazda sedan? And they said than current cars even didn't have independent rear suspension...   I think it's worse, Mazda took decades of advantage to still making terrible sedans  I owned one, Mazda 3 2018, worst car ever driven, and that thing even didn't reach 20k miles...
Please give it another review after the software update
Another reason why I will continue to not look into EVs.
By our American Teslas. Don’t buy Vietcong and nazi VW
Anyone who has a new Subaru would say the exact same about the chimes.  It's annoying!  But it's all the driver assists we've started putting in newer model vehicles.
Do a follow up
give it another try
Watch these comments - pro VinFast people will come on here and accuse y'all of being anti-Vietnam. They've done it on my Vinfast videos, as well as those written reviews and threads on Reddit.  BUT, great video and nice to see y'all test it!
Test it again next year.
Donut does game reviews next? 🤔🤔
thats a dogshit car
They felt the need to apologize the actual owner in the end tells you all you need to know.
I'd love to see a 6 month/1 year update
yiiiiiiiikes..
More green civic please
This is the type of quality that's found in a car thats priced well below the competition. Like $20k to $30k.
Imagine you want to go for drive but you can’t cause your car has to update first
This was a cool video! It felt like a mix of all the old shows, and was entertaining and informative.
Obviously they shouldn't have sold the proving ground they bought from GM. They still need it.
I won't stand for that game slander you chose a company that got shafted by mother nature and one from a company that put 100s of hours putting work into making it better.
Car not letting you change lanes without a blinker seems like a direct shot at BMW drivers
Makes you wonder how did they get such technology so quickly! What company let up to vinfest? Did they steal technology that they didn't carry out correctly much like a Chinese company... I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.  This car points out many issues with all this technology and vehicles taking the responsibility away from the driver when it's still yet their responsibility! We used to drive around with even less accidents because people paid attention nowadays everybody has a cell phone up their nose and that's why issues are getting worse! Now we have Smart cars that are supposed to be smarter than the idiots driving them but this just shows a little bit of wrong programming or someone finding a way to hack into a system and now all of a sudden everybody's car is giving them incorrect information! But because the people are so ignorant they've been believing that their car is smarter than them and always tells them correct! I don't know what the major viewer age ranges on this however let me explain something to the youngsters! Computers crash computers do the wrong thing even though they've done the correct thing a thousand times before! Computers get bugs viruses Trojan horses etc. Computers crash fail lock up overheat decide not to work one day when they work perfect every day before and then work perfect the next 20 days after that and then completely fail! So the fact that we're relying so much on computers that have shown that they have done nothing but fail in the past just shows the ignorance of not only the people making these automobiles but also the people falling for them! While you're at it getting electric vehicle... Anyone with common sense he was ever seen what happens when an electric motor stops will realize that's probably not a good thing! Yes they are making electric motors better and they can fail without immediately locking up however there's a good chance an electric motor is going to lock up when something fails majorly! Can you imagine doing 80 down the highway since everybody speeds now when your electric motor locks up and there's a semi doing 70 behind you downhill! One of these days people will start to realize that technology is not the greatest thing since sliced bread yet it is making people more ignorant more lazy and more all around worthless Well telling you it's helping you! Anyone over the age of 30 should easily be able to see that America is getting dumber we don't need more things helping people get dumber
We went from releasing half baked video games to half baked vehicles 🙄 (and both got more expensive 🙄🙄🙄)
Where did the sunroof go and what happened with the rolling test?
As a Vietnamese who loves car, VinFast is pretty much a scam. If you know how this company does things since day one, there will be some serious questions about what the fuck they are doing.
Lol dude stopping on the accelerator and nothing happening is crazy!
If you explained this car launching and being able to be bought to someone in just 1995, they would have looked at you like you were an alien.  We as humans, are really good at adapting to massive change, and sometimes that massive change is a massive failure.  We are in a weird cycle where we don't seem to care about reality.
Give it another shot and see what the updates fixed. I'm just curious if it fixed the issues, definitely  do not see myself buying one of these vehicles though.
Who would’ve thought people that can’t drive can’t make cars either
Why does some of the stuff discuss here skins like stuff that happens in a Haval Jolion
The list continuity!!
4:18 tesla has left the chat
Give it a few months maybe even a model year and try it again
I hate that as a society we have decided to add all of these unecessary features to cars instead of educating and punishing drivers who cant do simple things, like using signals for turns and lane changes, and vibrating or lane keeping assists because you have no spacial awareness.  I understand you can turn these off (my vehicle has them and i turned them off before i left the dealer lot) and i understand some of these features have benefits (lane departure assists if you're falling asleep at the wheel... I mean you should have the wherewithall and awareness as an adult person with a license to assess if you're too tired to drive) and blind spot warnings are a very nice feature to have, but i strongly feel that alot of assists take the control and the desire to drive your 30K, 50K, 100k+ car, and at that point you may as well take the bus in my opinion. Driving is an active ability that requires constant attention, and having a licence is a privilege.
I 2nd the "Stop re-inventing [known and accepted HMI mechanisms] just because it's an EV". Once I actually sat in a Tesla, I lost all enthusiasm for it. Also I wish designers and engineers would focus design around the human beings, not strictly by arbitrary safety and trade regulations to check the box.
What happened to donut?
Please make another video about Vinfast VF8 and also VF9
I can have a Vinfast or a really nice 69 Firebird for the same amount of money, going with the Firebird 👊
What a shame, the Vietnamese people have a really great work ethic, I was really hoping they'd offer some competition to all the dull Chinese car companies.  But I guess it's inevitable that a brand new Asian company isn't going to be great at making cars.  2540kg ?? The car is THICC ! 😲  As someone with Asperger's, those chimes would make me want to torch the car 😠
This car hasn’t had bad reviews, they were about 6/10. Notice how they didn’t show any of that at the start?
Honestly I love that the company is working to address all of the issues and I dont have an issue with them having such issues as they are a brand new company that launched a car during COVID. I will give them a lot of leeway as long as they get their shit together.
I rented a BMW that would try to fight you on the lane change, if you didn't hit the blinker first. Also, you couldn't turn it off because it was a rental. And the lane assist wasn't great.
This company has existed for barely 6 years, people are being way too hard on it. Its build quality is still better than Tesla has made lol
The startup is like a Tesla Model Y. so what
How many have they sold??
Even if they fix all the flaws, it doesn't matter. Cars don't exist in vacuum. In the stacked EV market, with 50k why buy this car instead of the plethora of EVs? This car doesn't offer any competitive advantages over its competitors, not even in price. Why gamble your money on a manufacturer that probably won't even exist 10 years from now.
I drove a Subaru cross track rental car. I turned to move over in the left lane without using my blinker and steering wheel jerk me back to the right lane!
Nice Cyberpunk reference🤙🏻
Yeah, let's see the follow-up
When I went to the Toronto International Autoshow, the VinFast VF8 literally shut down whilst I was inside of it.  Then it began rebooting.
I like the video and I F with you guys but you should have interviewed somebody and tried out the updated cars before releasing this video. Thats the true journalism
Let's see it boys, did they fix it? I wanna know :)
If you guys retest the vehicle, make it a filler beach trip episode.
Electric is dead, long live gasoline!
Besides the bugs, the car's hideous inside and out and they're asking $50K....GTFOH!!!
A car designed by someone who has never driven a car.
so you better pick up your VINFAST today!
No, you should never have to put a car in Drive just to start it.
Or maybe, instead of giving us aftersales service, they can lower the price of $50k car down to an actual reasonable price for a car.
this car should be removed from road it is dangerous
Vinfast? I've never even heard of it....
EV's have been shoved down our throats WAY too early.  I'm Canadian.  In very cold weather, the range drops significantly.  Imagine freezing temps, and you have to limit your creature comforts to make sure you reach your destination.  ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
It’s a shame.  I’m hoping they do better soon.
We'll see if they can patch the bugs, but I'm not holding out much hope just given that the car was rushed that much, it has that many problems, it costs 50Gs, and it's competition is so vastly superior for the same price
The acceleration issue is the same on my 2019 BMW M550i I can press it 20 times and it does nothing. But that's very typical to ICE cars, VF8 being EV should feel a bit faster to react
The car looks kinda nice though. It would be interesting to see if they can improve and potentially become a competitor.
Re-test it, give it another chance 🫣
6:12  So incase of evasive maneuvering the car will ensure you crash into whatever is in front of you!!🤷☠️
Do it! Update video!
They were smart businessman. Think about what they did. Keep an eye on that brand.
That's a weird startup
11:55 That's like blowing up your engine irl 😆
Repeat after me class…Fuck…E…Vs….
I think they should be given another shot.  It's easy for us in our chairs watching to go "Hah, they screwed it up royally!" but it's not easy for an upstart car company to compete with the big players.
On the up side Vinfast will give you money for any call back. all the others don't.. I found one other thing, Vinfast will not work on the car more than 90 days in the workshop and will replace the car + $9,000 for workshop time.
Finally, a car I can wish on my worst enemy!
Yeah my country made that, not the kind of quality that I expected
I just bought a 23 Honda Ridgeline for $38k brand new, 9 miles on it. I got way more car than this car will ever be. Vin fast will never see my money
Please get ur hands on Mahindra roxor, please !
Back in '08 or so my dealership handed me a loaner car with a push-start ignition and its engine already running. After a stop for grocery, I found myself stuck on a loop between the first two ignition stages(accessory and on then off)at the parking lot for minutes. I called the dealership to know that I had to step on brake to start the engine straight. XD
A year later and NO MENTION ABOUT THE FU***** CANCELED TOUR… disappointed
As a valet attendant this car looks like my worst nightmare
It seemed okay until I saw they wanted 50k.
Even when they get it all sorted, this car needs to cost 75% that of it's competitors.
The fact VinFast are willing to correct the faults or compensate customers shows   they have more integrity than a lot of established companies.
Different doesn't always mean innovative.   One or two bad things might be petty, but after the list starts adding up, the entire package just isn't worth it.
I'm going to laugh at all these companies going under AGAIN from trying to push electric shitboxes like this when more people start refusing to buy these things.
VinGroup gives me the feeling of what would have happened if Bernie Madoff had invented Amway. I hope that's not the case, but their absolute, unabashed hucksterism sets off all my alarm bells.
Clearly Road & Track have never driven a Chevy Express van because those are hands down the worst handling vehicle I've ever come across.
Vinfast even sounds like a fake wish brand.
This is probably an incredible leap for Vietnam. Cars over there have an incredible import tax so they are insanely expensive and as a result most people use other forms of transportation. Having a car made domestically (even a bad car) might move the country to more of a car based culture.
You hate those safety features? Try a new big truck
Vinfast’s performance made every F&F film with Vin Diesel look like an Oscar winning actor!
I would say give vinfast a chance by driving a model Y, or something else.
This looks like kia seltos
do a follow up!!
I just got my first car and I’m really excited! I wanted to share it here so I can get tips on proper maintenance 😁👍
The front of this thing, Looks like Elon's kid in about 10 years 😂
It would have been more work, but some cars have different settings for the blind spot sensors - to change the sensitivity based on what relative speed an object has to be going with you. ( +/- 15mph, +/- 5mph ) Otherwise it will be disregarded as terrain much like in the vid if it isn't within the set speed range. Without knowing if there are system settings for it I can't agree it's not implemented right
I mean I’ll get nauseous in any Toyota so
I dont even trust a stapler made in china. Youll never get me in a car from there :s
if you want chimes, try the 2023 IVECO DAILY. jesus that van is a steaming piece of sh*t
You know, these new cars don't let you drive.. How pathetic is that.. If a person can't drive, they shouldn't have a license to drive.. I can't stand any of these assist systems in vehicles today.  They're not cars, half of not most are SUVs now. I miss the days of a great car.  I think that started to end in 2003..
I'm shocked that a communist country couldn't build a quality car. Communism has such a great track record of quality, like the Yugo or the Lada.
Give it another shot
Vinfast just reinforces that electric vehicles are made by, and made for, people that hate the process of driving. Which means it's only a matter of time before someone makes them into a fleet vehicle to get thrashed around and have their batteries explode in record time.
Chime hell comparable to a Citroen Station Wagon I drove in Sorento with a perimeter alert that sounded the entire time during an Italian rush hour!
What happened to the Sunroof? It was on the list, and then was wiped out and replaced with Driver Aids...
So in an emergency i cant swerve suddenly to change lanes to avoid smashing into something without signalling? Omg ya that shits getting turned off.
this car was definitely made by jews
Imagine having to do a secret handshake to operate a car. 💀
Not related to the video but to the channel. Next Hilow season, give Nolan the Hi car. W all have been saying it for 2 years now. He SHOULD get the Hi car.
0:38  -Volkswagen-   Volkswagon
I wonder how they will update the suspension OTA.
I feel like with upgraded suspension, a software update to fix the bugs, and price it way  lower than the Mach E it will make for a decent economy car.  50k for that car is not worth it!
Are they going to send software updates for the suspension? 😂
This car looks like a Saturn
Sorry Natalie
def want to see a followup vid
TELL US ABOUT THE SUNROOF YOU JERKS
As far as lane assist goes the  2023 Honda accord has the same issue you can’t change lanes without a turn signal and it will apply insane amounts of braking force when your cruising on the interstate. I stoped using all of the assist features about two months after purchasing
The car manufactures are missing the point . They need to build a $25k 4 door hatchback with fold down backseat grocery getter . Some thing that’s the second car that gets  used for every day use .
They are trying to build their first American plant right by my house, they are failing at that as well.
50 k for such a POS... wow
Rooting for any new car maker! Super expensive and competition makes everyone better, I think if this car was priced at like $20k they really could make a name for themselves but I doubt electric that cheap is safe and possible
I dont really care for all the fancy stuff they have in cars these days.  Sure some are convenient; but a lot of it I can do with out it.  Especially the big screen in the middle of the dash...  If I need directions someplace I will just use a GPS or my phone.  When I am driving I always use my turn signals and almost always check my blind spots.
Their repair pay deal is genius business plan that 100$ is easily and Uber and if they provide a rental then that’s expendable cash then
it seems like they're going to be making a lot of $100 payments lol
They’re gonna go bankrupt
This is what I like about my Chevy Bolt, it’s just a car that happens to be electric.
Hi
$50k??? The top end model Vinfast VF8 is $52k... Model 3 PERFORMANCE is $53k... Model Y Performance is $54K.
In ten years when you hit the accelerator the car will just say " no."           keep your old cars alive.
Do it please!!!
Now they can either VinLate, or LoseFast.
Heck yeah. Do another review.
Anybody else notice how much weight ol boy has lost?
and here I was, thinking that Vinfast's owner was Vin Diesel
I took longer to figure out the push to start on a ford than this, if anything can we just bring back actual keys? I want a car not a damn boat
Let's be honest, the chimes were the car being worried that James was driving. We all know how dangerous he is around hi- I mean expensive cars.
I mean communism has nearly never made a good car just ask Clarkson and May.
Again i say suzuki shouldve just toughed it out people wouldve been buying their cars back to back because of how reliable and cheap they are with the most basic things you need
I hope they fix that lane change issue. If you have to make an emergency lane change to avoid a collision, the last thing I'm thinking about is putting on my blinker
Yes! Gotta do a follow up video! I love terrible cars and am 100% here for this
So since its apparently ok to buy off gov officials, the governing body says its to buy off the consumer as well. What happened to the system of testing testing testing fix and then sell on the open market? Let me guess here someone will find a way to blame Trump WTF!!!
Wow, that throttle response in Sport mode was hilarious. Reminds of a Lexus RCF in comfort mode when you're trying to pull onto a fast moving road. At least the Lexus in Sport mode fixes the throttle response problem, but if you ask me, having a slow throttle response is dangerous.
Coffin Flop.  Beautiful.
James was so right at 12:50 - the problem with electric cars is they're trying to be novelties, we really just need a car that is electric powered. Most things people hate about most electric cars are not about the electric drivetrain, but all the other ways electric cars are designed. Though a lot of these complaints would be true for many late-model gas cars too.  My mom owns a Tesla Model 3, and half these complaints apply to it as well - though they don't get nearly as much criticism. The startup process is pretty much the same aside from the seatbelt requirement, not difficult but not at all obvious to someone unfamiliar with it. The turn signals absolutely suck, hard to turn them off rather than turn on the other one - Teslas are the one cars I don't really blame people for not using them. It isn't too bad about chimes, but I find the blind spot protection to be equally useless as this - no light on the mirror like most cars have, instead you'd have to look at the screen on the center console to see if it shows a car next to you. But some sort of blind spot warning system is necessary because visibility is terrible. And like the Vinfast, the turn radius is like that of a large truck. Though the handling, ride, and power response are pretty good.  As for the can't turn without turn signal thing - honestly a lot of drivers would benefit from that!
Ev 💩
I'll give this company 2 years before they leave the US
Man, I love the channel. I really do. But you guys have ruined what would have been an otherwise awesome video just by having Nolan instead of literally anyone else from Donut.
Poor Natalie. Feel like she should get a cut of the ad revenue from this video to get herself a good EV, like literally any other EV on the market.
The blinker issue would be a huge issue for me as I know of a local motorcycle rider was killed because the person that hit them and thier vehicle (a Dodge Durango I beleive) prevented them from taking the shoulder and rear-ended the rider.
Yes Vinfast is fast between company inception and delivering an entry luxury EV crossover, but the problem is their EV is crap. You want both fast AND good, then you need to go to the country that knows how to build cars, and especially EVs. The Chinese EV startups actually make compelling cars, and at the top of the heap is Li Auto, which was founded in 2015, and put their first model, the Li ONE, on the market in 2020. Now it is 2023, and Li ONE has already gone out of production and replaced by Li Auto's second generation of cars, the Li L7/L8/L9. In just over 3 years, Li Auto has sold over 350,000 cars, and just in the month of May 2023, they sold nearly 30,000 units. Not cheap cars either, since Li only make luxury SUVs, ranging from 45k-70k USD in price (in the Chinese market). Vinfast is doing very very very poorly compared to a company like Li Auto, or even compared to China's other major EV startups (Nio, Xpeng, Hozon, Leapmotor).
I wouldn't consider the starting and the blinker a positive. Maybe not a full negative but if it does annoy you that certainly isn't a positive
The blinker test made no sense.
There is no bad product, just a pad price. For 15k instead of 50k I’d go for it 🤔
No car should be able to control the steering wheel.  Idc the situation its dangerous
250 miles on a charge with a car that costs $50K?   I'm still sticking with my Fusion that gets over 500 miles on a full tank of gas. 😶 Even though, I pay 30 bucks to get a full tank when I'm at half a tank. 😠  Plus, a lot people fail to recognize the minor distances that they travel like going to school, work, home, or getting supplies for the house (groceries in particular).
Not sure what happened on this one but your audio levels are all over the place.
Give it another shot!!
did they fix the 1s lag on the accelerator? That's the most concerning part and probably a design flaw
I vote you give them another shot. Like any new car company there's teething problems, hopefully their updates turn what seems to be a hot mess into a serviceable car
Lest prove Vinfast if they really fixed the problem
I think a better comparison would be to kia. They weren't that good at the start but it was non stop improvement and now it's one of the better brand. Can the Vietnamese do the same as the Korean manufacturer, let's hope so, more competition is always good.
the throttle complaint reminded me of a new machine I worked with that had an electronic throttle.  there were operators who would stand there twisting on the throttle control and adjusting the desired output numbers, and complaining that the machine wasn't responding.  the machine was programmed to wait one full second before implementing any throttle changes, to let the operator to get the correct output set before adjusting the throttle.   I can see the benefit of a slight throttle lag, to even out any bounce from being oversprung and under damped.  I've seen people driving cabover trucks get into an oscillation pattern as their foot bounces on the throttle. so having it average out the throttle input over half a second would reduce that bounce.
3:04 yeah .. makes you wonder what the hell tesla was doing lol
Hi donut
Give them another shot! Although honestly I'm kind of hoping they'll fail in the states and their cars will become an extremely cheap used cars!
Idk how about reading the cars manual before starting it the first time. probably explains it
Wow 😳
The coffin flop sweatshirt Nolan has on is incredible
The Rav4 does that stop lane change if no blinker also. I think it is meant to stop people from drifting into other lanes. Use those turn signals people!
Hmm I can see one difference between a bad car and a bad videogame....
Atleast change your company name. whats a vinfast? Vinfast and furious?
So you are telling us that the guy who designed that submersible that failed on it’s descent to the Titanic was also in charge of design at this car company? Got it.
Question...... if it wont let you change lanes withojut signaling, does it take control if you are driving on a vary windy like cuve not gusty road? Or do you need to signal then as well? To me it looks as if someone in our gov was prob paid off to fast track this vehicle through the import regs????? Love you guys keep up the good work.
No Man's Sky is a great game now...
Wasn’t this the same company that was doing a rental program for their batteries too? So basically you could buy the car but still had to pay a rental fee on the battery and it would go up based on how many miles you drove?
the reviewers are racist f
This car is Season 8 of GoT.
They will repair the issues. Car reviewers are bunch of m
Why waste years of development when you can get the public to beta test your car. lol
When is Vinfast Vinfurious dropping?
lol as a vietnamese, i kinda see that coming
Why do they test a vehicle in the inner city with horrible traffic?  They should drive it in the country to actually drive it.
What a dumpster fire..bankrupt fast
Thank you for the videos 👍 I can't wait for Scotty's review 😆
James laugh at 6:19 😂😂😂
Nice that it comes in Commie Red
Cool vid, personally I’d never buy any EV! In general they seem awful.
i want to see a update ;)
I remember reading about these things and the only thing I could think was, "I have no earthly idea why anyone would buy one of these". There are SO MANY options that are FAR better.
Imagine trying to avoid a sudden collision and the car steers you into a crowd
Kind of looks like a Vauxhall.
First Donut shows the world about Subarus, now they’re going after Vinfast. More of this!
No this car is a death trap.
the blinkers issue is a common issue in the automobile world for example BMW does not supply the signaling option at all.
wooooooo new cid
the yugo of the 21st century
Oh look another shitty ev
It's like they didn't even test it. This is what would happen if Bethesda helped make a car.
It not allowing you to change lanes without putting your blinker on is an instant and absolute fail for me. Incredibly dangerous. Never mind any of the other complaints.
Goes to show that just making a basic car that drives well and reliably is hard enough. Factoring in the complexity of driving assistance features, passenger comfort, and all the software that drives it makes developing production cars very expensive and time consuming. Lexus spent a BILLION dollars and 7 years developing the LS400.   Granted this was back when cars were a lot less complex. This is why 90% of "new" cars that debut are all based on existing platforms using tried-and-true parts from the companies inventory. Making a car is hard and making good production cars is insanely hard. Given VinFast's tight production timeline, it's no surprise this thing is a mess.
50K for that pile... *NO THANK YOU*
You cannot VVinfast!
Unsubbed sue to EV content
Cyberpunks release plagued the game so badly that to this day I haven’t gone back to the game.. I doubt anyone who experiences Vinfasts cars will be getting one..
Would love to see the update video
If they ever fix their problems they should call their next model “VINdicated”
American journalists are like that they shit on newcomers that are asian brands when their own american brand is the real shit.
This video came at a great time, a Vinfast dealership opened up near me in Ventura CA, and I was curious if they were decent or not.
You said it perfect James. Electric cars are are trying too hard to be different. Just make a normal car that's electric.
They are trying to do too much. Any intervention with human steering is extremely dangerous. This prevents evasive maneuvers and can easily cause a major wreck. |A self-driving mode that the user can interrupt at any time isn't so bad, but interfering with driver input is so negligent to safety as to be 100% liable.  I feel much safer around drunk drivers than around self-driving cars.
Vinfast sounds like a vehicle history website
“I don’t like the chimes. It’s annoying” that’s such a first world problem.   In India people sell their children out of poverty and still don’t complain
Seems like they could have a Kia trajectory...Kia was literally using pot metal when they launched, we're very unreliable and cheap. Year after year they steadily increased their production quality, hired proper car designers, and now build some of the more desirable, reliable vehicle in their price category. They've elevated from budget brand, eaten NIssan's lunch, and have a respectable brand now. I'd love to see a Donut video on Kia's ascension from the pot metal depths of automotive hot garbage.
Modern gaming, now in automobiles.
Why the fuck are we getting vietnamese cars now but renault and so on aren’t sold here?
Where's the honda 😢
1:44 i expected a low quality "the bluetooths device is ready to pair" sound for the startup
Should have just kept it simple.. way too many bells and whistles you're basically just looking on your phone.. we are driving after all not playing with a computer 🙃
Remember, this car was built for developing world blind Asian women who’s last car was a Chinese bicycle or a Carabao
I think you need to give Vinfast another chance but you have to let the dog eat. Focus on its obvious off roading abilities and the power of its E-beans.
It’s it’s an EV it literally doesn’t count as a car. Change the title.
Still better than an ID4 or BZ4X.  Because at least Vinfast is trying and is clearly working to compensate customers when problems arise.
I test drove a pre-production vinfast at an electric car auto show. It had sticky breaks.... Only tested a vinfast because i didnt want to wait long for other cars. I'd say sales team failed letting a car with a small issue out for testing. And the quick fix was to speed up and break really hard, almost gave fkn whiplash, I wasn't ready for it.
VinFast or Vin straight to trash.... To me their car only looks nice on the outside but is complete trash everywhere from drivability, quality, and just simple things like even a blinker doesnt need to be complicated...  50K for this? Yea just no. Honestly at this point, even cars made in China like BYD is far better than this.  After sales policy is stupid as well. These type of policies are complete scams if a manufacturer pays you for each problem. It just gives an impression they have no intention to even care about fixing the car and hence paying you per problem as a recompense for your inconvenience rather than their awful product.
The end of this got me a sincere laugh. As a gamer, No Man's Sky *did* work out most of the bugs, but made some controversial changes people still complain about. And Cyberpunk 2077 is STILL busted AF. xD So the fact that you used those two games as examples is hilarious to me.
So, not really as bad as indicated ... but clearly under cooked.
The startup thing is kinda ridiculous to complain about. I thought a lot of electric cars are like that where you don't need an engine start button nowadays
My problem was not related to the hardware, but rather that they won't let you fully buy your own car. Specifically, you cannot buy the battery. They force you into a battery subscription service and lock you into their terms.
Tesla Model 3 and Y have really similar issues, and the riding quality of the Teslas are horrible
This car won't survive in my country, and may be will breakdown too soon.. Anyway I live close to Vietnam 😅
Very good reference to No Man's Sky or Cyberpunk 2077 mostly having issues by a rushed launch, the difference is that this car being shit and buggy is actually dangerous or can be a significant loss of money and waste of time, while rushed video games just aren't as fun as you'd want for paying 60-70$ for a AAA game you then play in your free time. And despite some degenerates sending death threats and hate mail to the game developers making it seem important, I simply don't think the weight and importance of making sure you release a finished product cannot be compared to making a 2+ ton car, potentially a 16 year old could be in control of on the public road.
Vinfast, the new Yugo for the 21st century.
.... Reminder to mental note: Don't buy Vietnamese vehicles, you don't know what they do to them
hopefully gta 6 could do the same.
The not changing lanes without signal would be great for ohio drivers
Vinfast sounds like a Fast & Furious tribute, and that franchise went downhill…
How is a software update going to fix the suspension?
“volkswagon” 💀 💀 💀
I test drove this at CES this year, it was not impressive, they did give out cookies though
finally, you guys are my favorite car youtube and you're finally reviewing this car
Yeah new video after update would be nice 👍
I’ve come to realize more and more that “car journalist” are not car guys.
I don't understand why anyone would buy a car from an unknown brand for the same price as an equivalent car from a renowned brand, my country has had several waves of "Chinese invasions", and in the early years they sold cars at a loss, at significantly less than the competition, and only when they were established did they raise prices.
Why was this car so bad? Did they even test it?!?
Car was clearly made to be super safe….
Vinfast is new to the game so of course they will have problems right away
A Vietnamese car, an EV???  You gotta be joking.  I thought the Chinese EVs were jokes but this...  This is not even funny.  It's just horrific.  What are these EV newbie companies think of?  Do they really think they can just walk into our EV market and start making dough??  LMFAO!
SO if you are about to get mugged trying to get in your car to get away.  The muggers have plenty of time to mug you while you put on your seatbelt.  And I am 100% a seatbelt user.  This is a no for me.
I love my 97 gas guzzler 😅 (I actually get great gas mileage) I enjoy taking the seat belt off once I hit a gravel road and it’s old enough to not even have a seat belt alert I love it so much it has every thing you need and none of those annoying bells and whistles than end up restricting driver experience.
The best car ever made is the Lexus GX 470. They should make it again EXACTLY how it was.
Is it natural to compare games to cars in sense of rushed development? Or are all Donuts (name for fans?) gamers and it’s okay?
An electric Yugo, yay!
Well, I would agree that the startup sequence is annoying because it is a sequence, in my car the only thing that I have to do is turn the key, obviously if the car is not in gear, if it is in gear I also have to press the clutch otherwise the car starts driving on the power of the starter motor.
Lemme see them updates BOIII
From donut every day to donut irregularly, maybe twice a week.
Well guys... lets make it clear... murica is known for many reasons, but... smart people isn't one (yes, in this country is written on microwawes to not put children inside, or "dont eat the paper" "coffee is hot" in fastfoods etc.) :-| so the car must be bulletproof (i mean idi*t proof)
how does this not have a start button?! lol
I'm curious what the car would be like 6 months later with some different springs andshocks.
Can you tell us what vinfast says were the specific things that were fixed via software update?  I've been trying to get info from their sales reps and it's like pulling teeth.  I actually want to buy this car too!
Retest ot
When is Donut going to just start manufacturing their own prototype vehicle and call it the “DM HiLow M0P0W” with an optional “BNZ” performance package?
So this is an ad?
The startup is just like Tesla....  But people wont bitch about that?    (I'm not saying the Tesla shifter is bad, I actually like it)
Vietnamese have terrible quality control. I'm sure some cars are much worse than others.
Absolutely not! These issues are VERY much still happening. On some cars it’s even worse, they’re quick to dismiss issues or concerns so we’ll see if they actually fix these issues. Tbh they should’ve been addressed before releasing the vehicle. I’m surprised no one has been hurt yet given how they randomly shut off when driving. POS!
BTW, NEVER buy things based on promises, if it doesn't perform, either wait, or get another thing.
plz do an update video. im just curious.
Give it 6 months or a year, then do a review.  Do a quality review also and make sure it isn't falling apart.
Comment
The problem with Vinfast is they would rather spend money promoting the car than engineering it.   When it came out there were YouTubers that made VERY lavish all expense paid junkets to vietnam.
it's fun to pick on, but I do hope they work out the issues.. more competition = more better
Do another VinFast video
ABSOLUTELY DO A FOLLOW UP. If they claim it's fixed... Then let's see it. And I'd recommend the same exact car, but with their patch installed. Not some handpicked model VinFast wants you to try.
The start up procedure is identical to tesla aswell
Would love to see more  motorcycle content, we need a donut channel for bikes!
Love the content please keep it up
Seems it deserves another shot, don't you?   Building a car is a complicated deal.....give it another test and see how they do.
I dont get how Car dudes who run a car YT business can choose to stay in California, which has the strictest anti-car laws.  Makes me take the channel less serious
The car refusing to let you steer the car because you didn't have your turn signal on is absolutely one of my biggest gripes with lane assist crap. Sorry but I do not trust the developers of this software to value my life as highly as I do. As such any car that has the ability to ignore my input is a car I'll never consider driving.
i like how you didn’t address “rolling”. good job.
Imagine you swerve to avoid a crash and it swerves you back into it 💀
I have never heard of this car before.  Where in the United States did it launch?
I would not trust a new car company from a country where not many people actually drive cars and doesn't have many high speed long distance roadways, especially knowing that it was basically 3 years from company founding to vehicle launch.  Would definitely like to see an update vid or two to see how the patches work and if they ever decide to address the suspension or turning issues
How ba-a-a-ad can i be? Im just frigin big piece of shit. How ba-a-a-ad can i be How shit can i possibly be?
It's Underdamped, not Underdampened.   Shock Absorbers are Dampers, not Dampeners.  Example, Bill Clinton Dampened Monicas dress with his baby mayo.
Nothing I love more than a $50k ticket for beta testing their junker. 😂
wonder if they will produce a Vin Fast Vin Diesel?
Where would you even get it serviced?
Brand reputation is everything for a car company, Subarus are quick and reliable now but will never outlive their time of blowing head gaskets. This car is crap and for 50k it’s insane to buy one over any alternative. No software updates will bring them back from this imo.
So you have to wait for the patch before this thing is dependably driveable? It's bad enough when video game developers pull that shit...
Henry, he's such a creep... I would give him money if he was sitting on a park bench.
Show.Me.The.Crash.Test.
SAVE CORNCOB TV
here in san jose there are a lot of EV customers and proud vietnamese community if anyone were to lease one it would be here but have not seen one. its a really tough sell in a competitive market. vinfast tried to drum up local interest with a display at the mall. i wouldnt write the company off yet, they are extremely well funded and subsidized.
Is there a good part on the 405?
I think you guys need give a new shot and see if they have fix the issus or it is pure garbage talk they have made
Is nobody going to comment on James' hair at 13:11? Is this the first time we've seen him sans hat?
I want a Vinfast nFurious Diesel.
Is this an example of a new "let the customers beta test it" attitude in a lot of manufacturing now? Not all manufacturer's do this but some doo, and it is rampant in the software world for sure. I think you did a fair take on this car. I am also glad that most auto manufacturer's do not put cars this far from satisfactory on the market.
50K for a car from an obscure Vietnamese car company... lmao you deserve to get scammed.
vf8 looks like a knockoff renault
The VW ID3 and 4 are no better, from someone who works for VW in the UK we’re having horrific battery issues with wait times of a year for them to be repaired.
Is Vinfast the next Hyundai? I would like to see you guys follow up with the company periodically.
I think "1 year later" is a good approach to this one.
We would love to see the "update" update video on this 🚗
Imagine trying to avoid a collision but the car refuses to steer because you didn't turn on the blinkers
$50,000 on a Vietnamese car, LMAO.
All ev owners enjoy being a cuckhold, especially the journalists
Drive another one
voting for another vinfast video to see how they progress and if they can fix their bugs and issues. they are a new company so it will be interesting to see how they work through their problems
Sig Sauer school of beta testing products on customers...
Looks to me like you've got yourself a 3000lb. door stop.
Oh my god  Could you even imagine buying one of these instead of buying an Ionic 5?
Software is not even BETA version...
People are gonna complain that anything about this car is different while calling Tesla visionary and fresh.
I thought donut died after the million dollar offroad debacle.❤
I've test driven this car before and it is absolutely the worst EV out there. The ride quality feels like something from the 90s and even when we would go to the manufacturer with our data they would not do anything about it
Give it another chance with the updates and all
Buy american cars
I was expecting a chevy cruze or a Nissan Altima lol or high car Subaru 😂
Yes, but they built it in less than 5 years. Jesus.
I’ll give you 5k for it🤙🏻
I don’t understand why they didn’t just put a simple start/stop button on the dash where everyone else. And the faulty blind spot monitor is really bad.
Vinfast Vinwiki... All the same.  Sorry Ed
I drove the Vinfast cars off the ship in Benicia, CA a few months back when they first came out! Telsa knock offs!
except cyberpunk 2077 wont leave you to die on the 405
Is this like the Chevy Corvair? Was an okay car, but the automotive industry ran a smear campaign to kill it? 😮
2 years later, I still think about the "stop posting about amogus" guy when I see the blue sweater dude
So at the LA Auto Show in 2022….the ABS kept freaking out to the point of falling. The fix was to do a hard reset. It was way too rushed.
😂 give them another shot cause the car actually looks good
She's trading it in after this video lol.
It looks like a Renault...
If I had 50K, and wanted an EV, I would get an AE86, pulled out the engine, flipped the engine for some cashback, bought DIY kit where you put electric motor instead of an engine (mounting the engine directly to your trans and clutch which means it would be an EV but still with manual) and that would get me to around 30-40K after being all done with body work, engine swap and battery included... I think you lads should check this idea out and maybe make an EV of your own cuz it might be fun and make many people interested in EV swaps cuz as of now all EV's are garbage and ugly looking or just expensive...
can you imagine if you have to swerve from something in front of you, and the car doesn't let you change lanes because you didn't use the damn blinker? that's a MAJOR safety issue, to the point where this should not be allowed on the roads right now
*underdamped
ngl, it looks like a car I would do in Automation The Car Company Tycoon Game with the stock parts...
VOLKSWAGON
The new Volkswagens have that same drive assist where it jerks the steering wheel, it almost caused me to crash a few times when I was renting one. You can have your right turn signal on and make a turn on a corner but if your left tire hits the white like on the left side of the lane your turning in, its almost like a small child pulling on the wheel.
Kind of seems like they are Beta testing the vehicle with the general public.  The new Meyers EV is doing similar but with a selection of volunteers.
LOL, in Vietnam they might be in jail.
"This car's a piece of shit" - James😂
Call them out! Get that second test run!
Why would anyone choose this over Ioniq 5 or even Mach E
If you eventually do a "Did Vinfast fix their issues" video, I vote for including a getaway skit.
Give 'em another shot.  Also include some mention of the Y in your review, it is the best selling car in the world right now.  Why skip any mention of it?
wow it really sucks but I hope they make better cars in the future for the sake of competition I mean their sports sedan has an ok design i think they have some potential
The chimes are pretty easy to explained. The traffic here in Vietnam is… not good, so the manufacture decided to put a bunch of sensitive sensors to make the driver stay on guard. Vietnamese people on roads usually are pretty wreck less. On the roads is like filling the blank space or take chances to go through every possible gaps. Feel kinda bad for American people to use the same software as us.
Electric are fail
THEYRE SAYING I RIGGED IT! I didn’t DO SHTT!
ngl I kind of like how aggressive the car is about not letting you change lanes without signaling. Too many folks on the road that need that engrained Pavlov style lmao
I agree with James. I wish a car company would just make an electric car. Not a computer assisted driving car, but one I have to drive and pay attention. I don’t need any dings or chimes either.
please review updated kar
Bring back UTS and Science Garage
I mean just because your guys didn't work doesn't make it a good car or that it won't happen to other people
It is a scam. They are supposed to build a plant near me in North Carolina. Nothing is happening on it at all and they have already delayed it for many years. They spent way more money on luxury trips for auto journalists than they did on quality control. This company will never become mainstream in the United States.
Since i first heard about em a few months ago i've been very interested in Vinfast. An update vid would be cool, it's not everyday we get a new car manufacturer.
I've seen a few of these around me doing what I assume is road-testing. They look like GTA fake cars that bounce all over the road.
I miss Bart and Science Garage.
Good PR
Go again
The two cars you’re safe to drive in the ‘hood and not get it carjacked: Vinfast and any car with a manual transmission.
Not just vf8     Recently there released 3 new cars vf7 , vf6, and all new vf3 which looks like a suzuki Jimmy EV but smaller. But to be honest they make worst ev car . They don't have time to R&D(research & development) they just released the car whatever they want to it. Vietnamese ppl don't even care about how bad the car is and they just feel proud about  the company and the country
The Coffin Flop sweatshirt... 😚👌
This is like EA releasing an unfinished game, then patching afterwards to make it playable.
The cars will b better Americans are just picky and yes I'm an americsn So i csn say that but 50k for a that car is not worth it more like 20k
Day 365 of asking  up to speed on dodge rams
$50k for this?  It would be a POS at half the price!
Pretty sure you boys are just lil cry babies when it comes to rough roads.
Great vid
xong luon vinfast oi
Retest it
I"m curious what would happen if you needed to swerve to avoid a pedestrian or animal or something? If you didn't manage to hit the turn signal at the exact moment you needed to swerve would you have to just hit whatever is in front of you?
Explains why jabronis are trying to resell their reservations/allocations online so much recently 🤣
Easy fix, stop making electric cars.
Wait I'm curious on what's wrong with the sunroof, like why did you switch it with drive aid in the categories.
I Don't want to see the release broken game and then figure out how to fix it creeping into other industries. Gaming industry lately doning that alot. These days all games comes out is going to have game breaking bugs for weeks transferring that to cars will not be good for anybody.
Need up to speed ASAP
Release a broken product, then fix it via software updates. The future is going to be fun, folks. 🤦
It even mad me natious and that's because I'm only watching the video imagine being in the car
It was sus the moment it was called [VIN][FAST] VF8
You know that thing broke  on her right after she got it back lol.
outstanding
next review the Elio G or something lol
We need a high car with low parts VS a low car with HIGH parts!
Pls Review the Next Generation Ford Territory Titanium X
Please this car another review. Another chance at redemption.
Yeah let's see if they fixed the problems.   Gotta give people a second chance.  And with companies as long as it is not intentional yeah they deserve a chance to correct them self.
Up to speed in James’ dad is when?
if you can't switch lanes without the turn signal, what happens when you need to dodge or avoid an accident or something like that?
Dude you had so much more room to back up! 7:01 if you backed up more you wouldn't had to have made another maneuver
That car can't be as bad as that hair...
Software update isn't going to fix the ride quality
Lol, I was behind you guys on the freeway, I knew that red v thing looked familiar
8:00 The Teslas wheels weren’t spinning lol
The car that makes you depressed and sick when you drive it. Awesome.
First time I’ve even heard of that car or car company.
Pro tip: If a type of car isn't sold in Australia dont buy it. Australia has the best consumer protection laws in the world (ADRs) so most cars sold there are kinda worth it. Except Jeeps and MGs.
Honestly between their promise to patch all the software issues out and the "Special After Sales Policy" it sounds like they really do care, even its a bit embaressing to need to do all that in the first place.
Covid…😂😂😂😂 everybody who ever got covid had or still has a weak immune system.
Day 1 of  asking donut to pin my comment
As someone who drives Shitboxes as a hobby, I think this is a good "Going to town car" but lets see how this car improves in the next couple years.
I really miss when donut had the shows, like wheelhouse, money pit, and James, giving us an up to speed story on his dad.
Please be my dads
Damn, Vietnamese like myself really looked into this car and our expectation were really high since release. After this video… this thing is even a taxi, and there are a lot of them on the road.
Hey uhm, did you guys have 2 different kind of boards?. One is different from the other. Like one had “drivers aid” and the other “sunroof”?… what’s going on guys 👀🤣…
50K for a car from wish
Does Vinfast make family cars?
Now compare it to a 5k car and see if it’s worth 10x it
do it again, let's see what Vietnam's got
Curious abot what the thing was with the sunroof that was erased
A 50k EV from another brand I’ve never heard of…what could go wrong?
The best way to fix or make an EV better… is to throw a v8 in it.   MoPowa Babeh!!
Most cars the blinker dosnt turn off just by changing lanes lol u actually have to turn for it to click itself off.
Underdamped fellas, underdamped. Dampen is what you do with a rag and water.
bruh get the hyundai and call it a day
If this car had used a diesel engine, it would've been called VinDiesel
If China can't make a decent car, how do you expect Vietnam of all places to make one
wheres money pit :(
50k for that car is absurd.
Hi
Wonder what they paid for this? (Less than min in)
I refuse to call the Ford Mach-E a Mustang
:)
This all reminds me of the early access epidemic we're experiencing with games. Companies just have no dignity anymore.  Funnily enough after writing this comment they did compare this car to a bunch of buggy, broken games. Except games are something you enjoy in your free time and cars are well... something you have to depend on to drive you somewhere safely. I think Vinfast should be banned outside of Vietnam. This company clearly doesn't take their customers serious.
Why did you take out the sunroof rating😂 5:42
Let's see how it is in five years if the company lasts that long.  Also, somehow you guys managed to misspell Volkswagen.
Yeah, "foot on the break" has basically been standard in every automatic transmission car for years and years. Having to have the seat belts buckled in the only "weird" part, but even then it's not unheard of.
you lost me at vietnamese
WE NEED TOOL PARTY BACK IN ACTION
No Blinker: No Lane switching Had that in a rented Golf, nearly had a head on collision while returning into my lane after overtaking  Edit: Rural German road in the evening, 2 other cars for miles,
You guys should approach Amazon with a show idea.  You have the chemistry and the cars to have a great show
The worst reviewed car?! Just because it doesn’t start doesn’t mean it’s bad
How are you not comparing this to a model Y
It’s a communist car. Name a single commie car that screams quality! No? Nothing? I didn’t think so.
It was reviewed positively on EV focused channels. Those channels were not American. *EDIT - Yeah it looks like shit. Guess those other reviews were biased. Welcome to the internet lol
I hear Vinfast and I immediately think of "FAMILY"
Sick 😂
we need up to speed back
I still dont understand who buys evs..
Ohhh man I had some hope for this car lol….
I have never even heard of it
VinFast should buy Aptera. Aptera is literally taking decades to get to market.
I drove a Ferarri out in vegas a few years ago and it had the same bullshit as the blinkers - you had to press BUTTONS (that were squishy and gave you no tactile feedback that they were actually fucking engaged) or clicks. Imagine driving someone else's six figure car in the middle of friggin Vegas rush hour traffic AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOUR BLINKERS ARE ON. AWFUL.
Bring back real cars and put them in production.... please. Before it's too late.
hi
Its a vietnamese company HELLO
Im happy that a Crossover SUV sucks It's time to stop with CUVs it's so goddamn annoying
3 months sense asked for a up to speed on the British rover brand
I remember visiting vietnam and seeing these everywhere i go and the full size sedan looked pretty damn good
Its a EV so...
Yo from Louisville KY myboy
50k American? I could get a Tesla in Canada for that pricetag
DONUTTTTTTT
Vietnamese immobilizing Americans since the 1960s.
I can see why its so terribly reviewed      Its one of those ugly Crossover SUVs
How funny, I just saw one of these yesterday and was thinking wtf is this
Hello!
I think North America just isn't ready for Chinese/Vietnamese EVs. Hopefully that will save manufacturer from the Chinese takeover on EVs
I was just checking to see if any new vids had been published in awhile.  2 minutes later this drops.
I hope you guys don't get sued by Vinfast.
Is this anrebrsnded Renault?

American cars are always afraid of Asian Cars. Those are fake reviews.
Q
wait, that’s not a jeep?
Car was not ridiculed in Canada. Interesting review.
hey early gang
ayo! u guys hiring?? haha new donut video yayaya!
If my experience with an MG HS is anything to go by, this will be interesting. (Worst car I’ve driven btw, the lane assist is actually dangerous and it falls apart more every day)  Edit: The comments about not trusting the car and the wonky accelerator are also issues with the MG
