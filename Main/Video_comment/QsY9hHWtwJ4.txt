Good work
Nocap is a talented young artist with immense potential. He’s been able to rise to a larger audience through his talent, consistency, and hard work. As a small aspiring hip-hop artist and producer, seeing him get more recognition is very motivating to me to improve my own music. Nocap still deserves more recognition than he’s getting but with time he’ll get em, just wait on it. Good things take time. One day it’ll be my turn too. Wishing an abundance of good things the rest of 2022 for everyone reading this! 🔥🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️

The 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 2. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours.  3. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened.    4. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.   5. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 6. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 7. Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk? 8. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 9. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.  10. All generalizations are false.   Editorial: Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET.  THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL. COVID 19 VACCINES ARE POISON, AND CAN BE PROVEN AS SUCH. THE LIES ON COVID 19 IS COUNTLESS. ONE GLOBAL CURRENCY IS COMING. THIS IS BIBLE PROPHECY IN THE MAKING. ONE GLOBAL GOVERNMENT, AND ONE GLOBAL RELIGION IS COMING.  IT HAS, IS, AND SHALL COME TO PASS. GOD HAS CONFIRMED THAT GODS SON. JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK IN MY LIFE TIME.   ANSWER.. JESUS CHRIST WILL BE THE ONLY HOPE YOU HAVE TO WHAT IS TO COME..
