Yo no entiendo a los coreanos que dejaron en flop este temazo..enserio ¿Porque está canción no pego por allá?
2025? ❤
song still hits
on twitter i saw that doyeon won an award for her acting, congrats queen <3 this is only the beginning and i just know she's gonna be so much bigger. but also seeing that made me realize i havent listened to weme for some time now and that i missed this song so I'm here
I miss wekimeki sooo much . it's heartbreaking ow thee bangers went unnoticed by the wider public
This masterpiece deserves so much attention, I'm so obsesses 🤌🏻💕
THIS SHOULDVE BEEN THEIR ESPRESSO
Im here, still here in 2025? Miss this girls
these girlies deserved so much more than what they were given T-T still love them and their songs and i wish them all the best <3
Miss Weki Meki. This banger should be what would've been their success break out, shame. Happy 5 years with this forgotten  art😢
5th🎉🎉❤
i miss this group 😭😭
最近またハマって聴いてるよー！セイちゃんかわいいー！
Jajaja qué god
i randomly remembered the pre chorus to this song and had to come check it out again, i miss these girls. hope theyre doing great wherever they may be
이거 도입부가 너무 쿨해서 좋음
this song reminds me of 2020 online schl😭
❤
still loving this bop
oh gosh weki meki truly is ahead of their time.
I'm not over from the fact Weki Meki didn't get at last one win in their career. Happy 2 days late debut anniversary, they supposed to be turned 8 years😤
2025 anyone 😊 ?
I miss my girlies so much :'))
keep it coming baby 😭😭😭
Ceri
언제 보더라도 쿨은 진짜 잘 만든 곡 ... 🙂
My favorite single from them. Runway anthem fr. Rip Weki Meki 😔
I miss them dearly. ;_;
por siempre iconicas
This song’s composition fits their vocals really well!
this still has me so gagged like
The one thing Fantigo did right was give Weki Meki good songs like this ugh
Mothers served so hard with this one
THIS WAS MY SHIT BACK THEN OMGGGG
I MISSS YOUUUU
This should be the song that blow then up😤
As long as I live weki meki will always have a listener on spotify
Someone make them viral again, like brave girls, please, i'm begging y'all
When this came out i was like, yass this is weme big return, they had the views and then they dissapeared for like a year
coolest song everrr
It should be their 1st win😢
It hurts nahhh
This song went triple platinum in my house.
Anyone 2025?
Cool walked so Crazy could run
That rap part
never gonna forget this serve thank you girls
いつか帰ってくるって思って待ってたんだよ。 未だに悲しくて最後の曲が聴けないから惜しんで過去のMV巡りをしちゃう。 やっぱり大好きだよ。
I miss u girls
Fantagio is such a ‘COOL’ company ✨
0:02 me when so drunk
this is so good holy
너무좋아진짜내추억의노래 잊고있었는데다시들어도명곡
g
TEMAZOOOO nunca te voy a superar Weki Meki
0:02 me when the robber says slay on the ground
What do I wanna say to the universe
this should've been their espresso moment 💔
all weki meki's choreo looks hella fun 🔥
I miss them so much 😭
사랑해용 우리 윜밐<3
i miss them
🥲 my girls
0:48 So pretty and cool !! Love the haircut <3
Lucy’s interlude where she’s accenting “recipe” like it’s slang hits SO hard
2024 and still vibin to this shi
I still can’t believe we lost these ICONS😔
They should have earned their first win for this.
Whiplash by Aespa sounds like this song / has a similarity.
cuntiest kpop song i fear
17M for one of the best kpop songs ever? crazy
Clark Edward Rodriguez Jeffrey Lopez Sarah
I hope these girlies thrive in whatever they venture into! I miss them! ❤

Robinson Anthony Moore Kimberly Smith Melissa
Imagine if they adopted this concept for all their songs, they would be amazing.
still iconic yet Fantagio disappointed them with how they promote this one. lmao
They were meant to take over kpop, but now we lost them. Hoping for Weki Meki members to thrive on whatever path they take. These girls won't be forgotten ❤
Godspeed Weki Meki, it was a fun 7 years, wish you all the best in the future!
Rip my fav group
literally their best omggg
rip
I LOVE WEKI MEKI TO THIS DAY <3
so sad korea slept on this
WHY YOU DISBANDED 😭😭😭
I’m having an existential crisis because I’m just finding out Weki Meki has so many bops
Mais um grupo incrível deixa a indústria do k-pop 💔
Ahhh choi yoojung you are so cool 😮
I love this song so much!! AAAAAAAAAAAAA
I love itt
fantagio count your days
Siempre hubo talento, lo malo es que no hubo apoyo.
Recuerdo haber escuchado esta canción y otras de wekimeki millón de veces en 2020 durante la pandemia, fueron una de las razones por la cual estuve muy entretenida y me abrí a escuchar otros grupos de k-pop durante ese tiempo. Me parece tan triste que su agencia haya desperdiciado tanto talento por muchísimo tiempo y que estén a nada de separarse. Les deseo lo mejor a las chicas y que puedan brillar en donde quiera que estén. 😓❤‍🩹
Siempre serán las mejores ❤
En mi corazón ❤❤❤
they deserved so much better. this is one of the best girl group songs ever made.
이 노래가 좋아.
I wish them the best from now onwards even if they disband. Fighting
This still is one of the best songs I've ever heard. I love the mv too
the difference between this and their last MV...
Coming here again to pay respects for their disbandment. They deserved so much better. Fantagio screwed them over so hard
This song is COOL
They totally left out one member in this MV.  She was hardly featured.
DOPE!
I.O.I - DISBANDED PRISTIN - DISBANDED PRISTIN V - DISBANDED HINAPIA - DISBANDED GUGUDAN - DISBANDED GUGUDAN SEMINA - DISBANDED DIA - DISBANDED WEKI MEKI - DISBANDED   MY HEART: *DEVASTATED* 💔
This is my 1st time listening to this song and ive been a kpop fan since 2017. Its heartbreaking to see how such gems go super unnoticed and underrated while some trash from big 4 blows up
THIS IS MASTERPIECE
QUEENS
Pronto 17M
KISA YESIL SACLI KIM?
أغنية جميلة كونها لغة الحياة و رسالة موجهة لشخص جميل 🎉❤
You're cool and best Weki Meki!
They're was sucessful, excellent and talented beauty band. Goodbye. I hope your life will be nice in the next times. I loved this song always.
Mis niñas merecían más 😢

it’s such a shame fantagio sent them on a one year hiatus after this, this would have been their break out song
Dude, I get it no... just kill me, if able.
No, absolutely not. Please no
so when will be weki-meki's drought end?????? fantagio, give them a fcking comeback!
So when is the disbandment?
They are going to be disbanded soon Fantasio don’t even release new album for them.
This was the best WeMe cb for me🔥 WTF DONT LET THEM GO LIKE THIS WHERE IS WEKI MEKI I LOVED THEIR SHOWS
Love
COOL =)
かっこいい！😊❤
Still fresh in 2024!
This is still one of the best kpop songs of the last 5 years. Sound, delivery, dance, styling, visuals, charisma, personality. Bring Weki Meki back!!!
i remember listening to this song when i was a new k-pop fan...

I was never a big fan of Weki Meki but I always followed their releases and I have to say, even if I didn't like it very much they were still interesting and I miss that.
살아있는 화석 빼주세요.
목걸이 귀걸이  팔찌  구성 빼주세요.

Weki Meki

🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷  I love your Dance 💞🔥💞🔥💞
Still can't take my eyes off Lua,,, she's amazing
LETS GO Ki-Ling HWAITING!!!!!!!!!
Weki Meki members are good at fucking a bitch name Lynsey Chaid
Idk why YouTube has started to recommend me so many great kpop songs lately but I'm not complaining 😂
=) Cool
Looking back at this music video, this is literally the concept most are doing now, from the style down to the sound and everything. Weki Meki truly are the trend setters.
I will never forgive the kpop community for overlooking ALL THESE BOPS that WKMK give us
WeMe was on a ROLL during Covid how did they drop so many bangers
언제들어도 너무좋음 ㅠㅠ
mothers are mothering
bring it back! cool!
3rd anniversary!
WDYM TOMORROW MAKES 3 YEARS SINCE THIS MASTERPIECE WAS RELEASED?? (Its the 7th for me!)
History was freaking made this day
I miss this era so much
I will never forgive the kpop community for overlooking ALL THESE BOPS that WKMK give us
Mind blown. So many genres in one song, it's fun.
:D
i’m obsessed with weme’s 2020 releases
:3
mua
Cool =)

My fav WeMe song.
I like this concept on Weki Meki it fits them very well they can pull off any concept tbh
The definition of a good song doesn’t need billion views
This is my favourite title track
Weki Meki really needs to comeback
This should have hundreds of millions of views 😢
they were so good
Please comeback, we need you
=) COOL
Here for Elly
LOVE THIS CONCEPTS
Cool =)
Fantagio wasted all their talented grps from astro to their subunits to wekimeki and debut a brand new bg for it to be ignored similarly like others after 2 yrs. I will always hate fantagio for breaking my ot6 astro, jinrock subunit and always blame them for keeping these talented girls in the basement for so long :((
BYE,This was so motha of them
best weme title track
weki meki is really amazing it's just that fantagio didn't see it. weme songs have big potential
LOVE ELLY'S RAP HERE OMGGG
2023 - Weki Meki sounding so 4th gen! So amazing! 💗💗💗
pinche canción buena
위키미키 진짜 잘 됐으면 좋겠다…… 🥺🥺  애들 활동이나 좀 시켜줬으면 좋겠다
Fantagio literally sleeping on them 😢

Fantagio is so stupid. Waste of those talented ladies
Uma das melhores músicas que eu já escutei em toda minha vida!  Essa obra merecia muito mais!
과장이 아니고 여태 본 모든 케이팝 뮤비 중에 제일 재밌음... 하 진짜 판타지오한테 화난다 진작에 위키미키 팬들 수요 알고 본인들한테 뭐가 제일 잘 어울리는지 알았으면 데뷔부터 화제 모았을 거 아니냐 강 프듀로 흥했으니까 무작정 데뷔부터 시켜야지! 이따구 정신으로 했으니까 명곡을 내놔도 사람들이 모르잖아... 제발제발제에발 역주행했으면 좋겠다
Las amo, vuelvan por favor uu
new rules
I still can't get over COOL, like, their best title track (I still love Crush tho😭)

2:18
I used to hate this song when my music taste was trash
I'm still sad this group broke up.
Suyeon looks like my aunt what the hell
weki meki deserves more and we need a new comeback fantagio
every every day I just wanna DANCE
Orbits supporting Weki Meki
sometimes you just have to come back to this
Weki Meki it's so cool that this song is an anthem
if you watch this music video, for "non-experts" it's very hard to imagine that yoojung is a master of aegyo 🤣  but you just have to love our grandmother 🥰
This song makes me feel like such a bad bxtch
this is gay culture
(隙自語失礼します。) 号泣した。朝から布団のなかで泣いた。友達に自分の将来の設計みたいなのを、普通の会話の流れで軽く話したら「え」「でもなんやかんや○○しそう〜」とか全然悪気なく言われて、悔しかった。自分がこれまで思い描いてた将来の憧れの姿、キャリア、やりたい事‥そして、その夢を思い描いてた楽しい妄想の時間まで全部バカにされた気がして悔しかった。悲しかった。 これまで遠くから眺めてただけのある界隈のTwitterも、いくら反対意見がバズろうと、その友達の反応を見たら、結局これまでずっと昔からそうだったように全部こうなるのが正解だと、世論は世の中は言っているようでどうしたらいいのか分からなくなった。今まで楽しく夢を描いてた自分のことが、大好きだった自分の未来が、正解が、、自分で分からなくなってしまって悲しかった。他人の意見で、簡単に途方に迷う自分が情けなくて悔しかった。結局私の夢は一時の迷いなのか、 その選択が後悔してしまうのか、じゃあやっぱり正解が多く見えてこの世の常識っぽい方を選ぶ方が「正解」なんじゃないかと思った。  でもこの曲の「綺麗じゃん今のままで 私は大丈夫」っていうところの歌詞が死ぬほど自分に刺さった。私の夢、友達はまっすぐ応援してくれない私の夢を肯定してくれて嬉しい。この曲、受験生の時に出されてその時から聴いてたけど、今一番刺さってる。そうだね、肯定してくれる人がいなかったら、自分で肯定したらいいもんね。死ぬほど落ち込んで昨日の夜からずっと泣いてた自分に自信がついた。ほんとこの曲の歌詞全部好き！wekimekiありがとう。自分大好き🥳✌️世界で一番輝いてる✨✨これから未来、もっと輝く自分を作るわ😎💪全人類期待しといてな❤️‍🔥
qué canción tan cool ♡
Can somebody help me to stan them with this MV plz ?
Orbits supporting Weki Meki

This is giving After School done right. I love it!  Everyone has great parts, interesting sections that build up in a satisfying way. This feels like ‘Kpop’ in the best way, idk how else to explain it.

1:47 this part is so hypnotizing
이 노래 되게 좋아해서 멜론에서 음원으로만 들었었는데 그땐 약간 하이틴 컨셉으로 꽉막힌 학교 규칙 다 찢고 다니는 하이틴퀸들인줄 알앗는데 요런 빡빡ㄱㅏㅇ력한 컨셉이었구나
Lol this is what I thought LE SSERAFIM’s song would be like, couldn’t measure up to my girls
IM OBSESSED WITH YOOJUNGS RAP AND ELLYS VOCALS RN😭😭😭
This is def my favorite song of the group. the styles are very captivating.
COOL
i don't know why, but I think this song is very similar to le sserafim fearless debut song :O
In my imaginary life as a model or stylist I would play this on the runway
LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH

Weki Meki
컨셉 너무 멋있어요 !! 당당하고 자신을 믿는 힘이 잘 느껴져요 의상이랑 안무도 넘 멋있고 띵곡 발견 🍾❤️
컨셉 이대로 쭉 밀고 노래하나 오지는 거 나오면 확 뜰듯 ,, 위키미키 잘되길
Acabo de darme en cuenta que ya se visualiza el número de suscriptores.

I don't understand how this did not blow up. First to last sound is perfection
Ya más de un año de esta canción y aún no la superó
Nesecito más canciones como la de cool
La mejor era de weme
このグループは毎回ダンスが芸術的！ もっともっと評価されても足りないくらい最高！
노래랑 춤은 진짜 잘 뽑았다고 생각했는데 뮤비를 보니까 왜 고급섹시 컨셉에 펜싱옷 같은 걸 입고있는 거지? 딱 미국 하이틴 치어리더 컨셉하면 트렌드에도 맞고 노래에도 맞을 것 같은데

Weki Meki definitivamente é um dos grupos que merece bem mais do que recebe de reconhecimento.
Knowing nothing at all about this group or their other songs, I think the white outfits work really well with the self confidence message because although they talk about clothing in a couple of lines, it's one's aura or energy that makes it clear that they are confident.
Hands down one of the best kpop songs of all time
5 songs for new fans: - Sweet Winter - 너란 사람 iTeen Girls Special - D-Day - Color me - Tiki-taka (99%) Have a nice week!
When nobody misheard : feel me now feel me now Feminine feminine
están muy infravaloradas :(

COOL
WekiMeki's title songs for new fans: - I don't like your girlfriend - Lucky / La la la - Picky picky - Crush - Tiki-Taka (99%) - Dazzle Dazzle - OOPSY - COOL - Siesta Did I miss any? Have a nice week!
Why do the comments get decreased?? It's like every week it rises up then gets deleted.
이런 곡 더 주시면 안될까요... 너무 좋아요  컨셉도 좋고 곡도 좋고...
Elly es muy linda !!!

Ahora de 2 en 2 :(
Las vistas están aumentando de 10 en 10.
Sei protagonista.
Elly dijo que la coreografía será fácil pero las notas altas.
Lua te amo.
Hola, volví.
He traducido los mood film de las chicas:  Yoojung: Cuando el sol me despierta siempre me pregunto si estoy capacitada para enfrentarme a mí misma.  Deseo que todo acabe. Que no exista nada.  Suyeon: Desearía que este tranquilo amanecer que me mantiene despierta terminara pero no lo hiciera al mismo tiempo. Siempre me cansa la repetición de las contradicciones.  Rina: El día vuelve a ser ceniciento aunque yo vacíe mi mente. El mundo que hasta ayer parecía redondo, de repente se ve nítido y hasta los cuadros se desvanecen en un instante.  Sei: El final de los pensamientos interminables era un acantilado después de todo. Esperaba que alguien me detuviera pero no había ni un alma siguiéndome.
keep it coming baby
Ya pero Sei y Elly actrices.
Debemos apresurarnos, 16 millones antes del 18 de noviembre.
En fin, hay que volvernos locos.
Ordered lots of Weki Meki albums and versions I didn’t have, before comeback news. Now, can’t wait to preorder comeback!
i had 101 problems in life and 100 of them have disappeared after looking at weme's comeback news. my height suddenly grew by 8 inches. my hair became smoother. my eyes bigger. my lips juicier. my teeth whiter. my legs prettier. my acne is gone. my crush just confessed.
The teaser with Yoojung felt very automnal and sad...
Cómo dije, dirijanse al canal de Fantagio, posiblemente ahí suban el mv.
YouTube no borres mis comentarios :(
I have done a Hangul subs track for this - please tell me how I can upload or send the .srt file. Thanks.
KI-LINGS! WEKI MEKI'S MOOD CONCEPT IS POSTED ON FANTAGIO YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND EXPECT THAT ALL VIDEOS INCLUDING THE MUSIC VIDEO OF THIS COMEBACK WILL BE POSTED IN THEIR. SO IM DOING THIS FOR LESS CONFUSIONS AND SO THAT YOU'LL KNOW. AND TO GET A HIGH VIEWS FOR THIS COMEBACK.

blinks 🤝 ki-ling being starved of a group comeback
당.장.컴.백.해.
not a 5th day of waiting for Weme cb: yeah i miss someday... but i come here to say fck Fantagio -0-
Vallan a dejarles mensajitos positivos a Sei porque ella se está esforzando por cuidar el medio ambiente , sin embargo  comentarios algo innecesarios siempre están por lo que debemos darle todo nuestro apoyo <3   En fin ya les dije que Sei Best girl? ♡
Las extraño
Lo ideal sería que cool llegara a los 20M antes de algún próximo comeback , por favor intentemos poner un poco más de nuestra parte porque de hecho las vistas suben cada vez más lento , lit es como que si fuéramos solo 10 personas en el fandom , se que hay veces en las q están ocupados pero escuchar una canción de 3 minutos mientras ordenan o se bañan   no cuesta taaanto , imaginense lo felices q estarían las chicas si ven que cool llega a 20M o  incluso más :(
WEKI MEKI MERECE MÁS RECONOCIMIENTO
Este grupo parece tener mas presupuesto q ASTRO pero FANTAGIO no le da promocion a ninguno de los dos :(     FANTAGIO como q a veces caes remal ;-;
wow so cool

When will they come back?
aquí extrañando a weki meki, en serio fantagio se pasa
Doyeon so cool
15.294.467
I'm ki-ling and Aroha.. but more to ki-ling... Let's just wait patiently for the Comeback ki-ling.. I'm sure Fantagio is planning something now.. same as ASTRO, they didn't make Comeback for almost 10 months last year.. their last Comeback is KNOCK and then after almost 10 months they Comeback with ONE.. Hope Fantagio didn't forget that weme is under their company😢
Seriously I'm so done with Fantagio. When did they will give weki meki comeback. They only give Astro Comeback. Astro already have 2 Comeback this year. Yes, I know weki meki have 3 Comeback last year. But that can't be the reason they didn't have any Comeback this year. Seriously Fantagio wasting this girl talent. Weki Meki also still didn't have LIGHTSTICK and 1st FULL ALBUM.
1:40 WHAT IS THAT SOUND EFFECT CALLED IVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND IT FOR AGES IF ANYONE KNOW PLS TELL ME
I MISS YOU GIRLS PLEASE WHERE ARE YOU
fantagio, wekimeki comeback when?😴

Weki meki!!
Primera canción que escuchó de ellas y me encanto…. Merecen mucho reconocimiento
A tus pies me traes Lua
ya 10 meses sin comeback :(( fantagio definitivamente no sabe manejar a weki meki, a las chicas les fue muy bien en esta era y muchas personas se interesaron en ellas, pero su empresa luego de este éxito las dejo olvidadas y los nuevos fans se cansan de esperar regreso y al final pierden el interes. weki meki merecen algo mejor que esto, 4 años de debut y ni un full album tienen.
We need a Weki Meki come back
Cool!
This song makes me feel like imagining myself as a cool person
Comeback plss

That one girl's hair looks like Yuta's from NCT at one point (the black and green) and it's such a vibe, really cool.
Kilings get ready for Weki Meki comeback!  Here prepare for votes: -heart jelly after 16th, because it will expired (starpass for the show & inkigayo) -red heart, star (idol champ for show champion, no expired) -beats (mubeat for music core, expired in 3 months) -please join on str34ming volunteer for digital (this important) -save money for album sales Fighting killings!!!
The style, the dance, the girls, the music, the lyrics, everything is *COOL*

This song is powerful af.
나 이거 왜 이제 알았지.. 노래 너무 좋아 어케..? 역대급이라고 생각됨 근데 노래에 어울리게 세이? 큐빅 메이크업처럼 더 퓨쳐 사이버틱한 비주얼로 갔어도 좋았을 거 같음 루시 전부터 눈여겨보고있었는데 이번에 진짜 너무 예쁨 무슨 모델같아 막내라고 해서 깜짝 놀랐음ㅋㅋㅋ 그리고 중간에 조명씬 너무 멋있음 보통 칼군무는 남돌들이 많이 추긴하는데 여돌들이 선이 가볍고 날렵해서그런가 칼각으로 출 때 느껴지는 특유의 카리스마가 있음
I really need a wekimeki comeback rn. :'(

A little advice if you plan on becoming an idol just don't go on produce 48 or shows like those cause produce 48 did these girls so dirty you won't believe it.
The fact that they're so underrated make me realize how fucking dumb this world is and how many people are missing out on a masterpiece like this.

I think fantagio should update Weki Meki's profile to:   Suyeon - Leader, main vocal Elly - Main vocal Yoojung - Main rapper, face of the group Doyeon - Visual, center Sei - Lead vocal Lua - Main dancer, lead rapper Rina - Lead Vocal Lucy - Maknae, sub vocalist, sub rapper  Oopsy was the best comeback for them and they need to bring back that distribution
Cool
Weki Meki deserves better😩😩😩😫

I really love that the visuals really differ from most girls groups. They really came with the bold looks instead of the typical girly glam looks you usually find with girl groups. I love the boss energy they give off, not mention their music is *chef's kiss*.

Fantagio, i know you will give Weki Meki a really really big budget next time. I know that, i know that.  If you don't, then j wasn't wrong. The one who wrong is you for not treating Weki Meki better ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I am so miss Weki Meki, but pls don't cb in August :( the whole Kpop industry is cb
STAN WEKI MEKI!!
SLEEP ON BEDS, NOT ON WEKI MEKI
COMEBACK PLEASE!FANTAGIO!

Lua ♡__♡
fuck fantagio all my homies hates fantagio
Stan weki meki.
Weki Meki sería muy conocido si tuvieran una promoción aunque sea básica y también si fantagio le quitara el concepto de girl crush. Doyeon y Yoojung tuvieron suplicar a la empresa para que todo el grupo completo vaya a un show de variedades para promocionarse. Ustedes se merecen un trato mejor.
AMO ESTE CONCEPTO AAA
Sei te adoro mucho luz de mi vida
DIOS es que no pueden ser más lindas

ME CONFUNDO MUCHO AAAA, creo que Lucy va a aparecen en "Ai Her" y en otro film aparte que es "Asia"
A que rabia, no se puede ver la película donde aparece Lucy en otros países que no sean Corea. Troste

Every day every night i asked, why Weki Meki didn't get the attention they deserve?
Every day every night i asked, why Weki Meki didn't get the attention they deserve?
It’s a bit sad but I think the group size is the problem. Companies seem to think n that IOI members will naturally bring in attention. Which is true but when you put them in a huge group, ppl who look for IOI will not want to put in the time to get to know others. They end up basically wasting IOI’s popularity. Chungha, the only successful one right now, is a great example of this.

Hai selamat siang  Hai apa kabar hari ini?
I need comeback
Actually i really waiting for their comeback in this year. I have a feeling that Fanmu will raise them well this time. I mean, when they have opportunity to be trended, like Knowing Bros, or cuz Tiki Taka. Fantagio's staff must be clever enough to raise them better.
COOL

Insuperável♡_♡  WEKIMEKI QUEENS☆_☆ Pfv retornem logo!!!!😊☆♡☆
Fantagio!!!! Danos comeback pronto.
Este mv y este concepto elegante y sofisticado les queda TAN bien, Weki Meki reinas
This still slaps and will always slap
It's been 8 months, where in the friggity fuck is Weki Meki?
Weki Meki comeback soon, pls. I miss u TT
¿Consejos para decirle a mi mamá que saque 6, 7 y 8? Si dejo de comentar es porque me morí.
I just wanna dance
Necesito un comeback ya :"""( Me largo a llorar.
Cool~
Fantagio staff pls be more creative in their concept
Doyeon and Lucy has an acting, so maybe WeMe won't comeback now...
here for lucy's recipe 🤭
I badly want a comeback but I trust fantagio music's timing. I'm sure these girls will make it since they are THIS talented. It's actually a matter of how hard will everybody work hard for a goal. And whatever that goal is, count me in ❤️💛

La esperanza es lo último que se pierde dicen 😔
¿No han anunciado comeback o algo? :(
To all the dislikers even though you dislike this, you're still giving views   thanks
Why do people keep disliking this??? This is such a good song
Lua making me gayier than ever with that hair
I don't want this group to end up like gugudan 💔
❤️
Dear Fantagio, i always call you Fanmu, but this doesn't mean i hate you. I really thank you cuz didn't give up on our girl, and also protect them(but for the staff who stole their and HELLOVENUS's mobey, i don't really sure, because i don't know whether you had give our girl a justice).  Then, THEN, pls raise them well 🙏🙏 you don't need to give us 3 comeback but with a small budget like 2020. You can give us only ONE comeback like this year, but with a big budget and better raise. Ok? Ok ( ᵒ̴̶̷᷄ д ᵒ̴̶̷᷅ )?
컴백 좀 합시다 ㅠㅠ
Happy 15M Views!!!

Fantagio te voy a tirar huevos

I want to listen to this in a club so baddddd
Korea is probably one of the most fascinating cultures in the world to me. The differences between the north and south are so stark it feels surreal. South Korea uses music and a constant supply of high production value eye candy to export its culture. It’s somehow been quite successful at penetrating western societies in just a matter of a few years.
Nearly 15M!!!

Hello Ki-Lings, AROHA here. Since astro promotion end, i think weki meki will cb soon, i'm here just only reminder to collecting for votes.. and if you can save money for album.. weki meki's album decreased slowly every comeback.. (and some people talk bad abt it 😭) if you can pls buy their album, if not it's okay.. if there's a team for voting / str34m1ng (korean music web) try to volunteer to if you have time :D. i think fanmu will upload their mv in fantagio channel.. let's claim win for weki meki's next cb!!

Por eso sigan con el $tr3am y traten de hacer que sus mutis y/o amigxs se interesen en weme
Siento que sería una muy buena oportunidad para las chicas, y si llega a pasar sería excelente que el fandom hispanohablante crezca más
Aunque me da miedo pq salía deamcatcher y loona, so sus fandoms son muy fuertes y ki-ling no es tan grande
Tengo una muti en twt que dijo que Weki Meki podría estar en queendom 2 Y NO PUEDE SER IGUAL ME EMOCIONE

No se si esto puede ayudar pero cuando weki meki haga comeback podemos responderle a los comentarios de hace tres años (que generalmente están en sus dance practice antiguas y teasers) diciendo que apoyen a su nuevo video, hace unos días me respondió una persona que comento hace tres años así que no sé si sea mala idea-

Ponganse las pilas kilates que ese 14,5M no llega solo
Pero que Cool haya llegado a tendencias en Perú  me puso muy emocional, lloro
O sea el video de una tipa farandulera de mi país está en tendencia #5 pero Weki Meki llegó al #13? Saquenme de Perú
En fin, stan Weki Meki para un mejor futuro
Un día voy a poner Cool en volumen alto
Por que mis vecinos son tan molestos? Nadie quiere escuchar sus lamentos, no me importa su religión solo callense

i'm so glad i'm not straight cause hey lua
How to overcome the insupermountable?
hello lgbtq+ community 🥦🌈
El saltito es superior
Estoy dispuesta a sacrificar mi dignidad bailando cool en frente de una cámara de seguridad
El segundo teaser tiene más vistas que el primero, desde antes de sabía que Cool sería tremendo arte
Honesty, i watched Produce 101 Bang Bang performance too, Yoojung is so special(caugth my attention) and wanted listen their songs. She is one of the best all rounder kpop idol. She caught my attention everywhere with her facial expressions, dance and rap. She has swag vibe in stage and mvs, but really funny and cute. She is so catchy♡
I learned this group after Into The New World collab-cover. Group deserves more attention, songs sound BOP.

*ACTION FOR THE AWARENESS OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION IN WOMENS KPOP*  Hey everyone, so as we all know, there are new people becoming Kpop fans every day which is great. However, this means there are lots of people who may not have the awareness of what goes on in the shadows of this industry. The truth is that trainees and Idols are often treated terribly by their companies through various means. This is seen both in boy and girl groups of course, but girls tend to take the brunt because of sexual harassment and exploitation from within the company and in the public eye.   FOR ANYONE NEW TO KPOP OR TO THIS INFORMATION:  I have compiled a list of videos lifting the voices of female Idol's and trainees who have felt the effects of this problem and felt compelled to speak about it. I encourage you to watch any or all of these videos and share this information in any way you feel safe in doing so. Please like this comment so others see it! We must come together on this issue and keep fighting for the humanity of women in Kpop. Please comment and discuss this too here. Post links to videos that contribute to the issue if you want!   ***SIGN THE PETITION BELOW AT THE VERY BOTTOM!!***   Thanks for your time, and I hope the future of Kpop is more humane for everyone. <3   WATCH ANY THESE PLEASE! >>>>>>>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nwoQEyihhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoISkfDZKCU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj9ZAZwisz4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdOA5BCwBi0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBGcbap5Gr4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9MsjQAZpA&t=801s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2hG5sfe0mE&t=2s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4htvWc2r1o  **** Petition: ****  https://www.change.org/p/change-the-way-kpop-idols-are-treated-by-their-agencies-give-human-rights-to-singers-who-bring-happiness-to-millions-of-people-all-over-the-world

This is the greatest song I've ever heard. I can't believe I am saying this but "Cool" is better than "Crush". I had this on repeat for the past couple of days and I don't get bored of it.
HEY KILINGS I FOUND A WAY TO PROMOTE WEKI MEKI ON THE NEXT COMEBACK!!! If you're on kpop stan twitter you might know the accout "best thing that happened in kpop" (@kpophappenings_) it's such a big accout (with more than 200k followers) that post requested moments about your kpop idols, you can go to their website (it's on their bio) and write a good or funny thing that weki meki did for us (keep in mind that you need to keep the anonymity of the weki meki member by using "that kpop girl") i've seen that many fandoms do that on their comebacks to promote their favs. Btw this accout is VERY big, the tweets usually get 5000-10k likes, so it's such a good promotion for weki meki and also you can send requests more than once so don't forget about sending a request about all the members ♡

Btw, ya se por que dicen calvo cuando hablan de Doyeon- 이나은 라디오 대머리 Supuestamente se burla de la gente calva pero DALAS CALVO DALAS CALVO DALAS CALVO.  Probablemente reírse de alguien calvo en corea es un pecado pero que se entienda que las personas cometemos errores y de los errores se aprende. Atacar a Doyeon no los hace superiores o mejores personas, todo lo contrario lmao. Se que está en español y por lo menos tuve que ponerlo en inglés pero que flojera-    OMG DALAS CALVO AURON CALVO RUBIUS CALVO MESSI CHIQUITO, no puedo

OOPSY, my COOL looking wig flew into space because of Weki Meki! Now I've gotta get a new weave, but I'm so PICKY PICKY! I want a wig that'll make me go DAZZLE DAZZLE!
Lua could throw her dirty laundry at me and I’d thank her, wash her laundry, and then replace it with Gucci, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, and Louie Vuitton clothes. Her green hair is just killing me, and I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who thinks so.
Tbh this whole concept is just a cultural reset. It’s so refreshing and I feel like Weki Meki is tryna say “people say 4th gen groups are just tryna have a dance off, rap off, vocal competition, etc, but we’re so different.” They give off a “I don’t give a damn, I do what I want” vibe in their music, especially in their lyrics.
Amo tanto a mis chicas
Really REALLY good production
Necesito que fantagio promocione mejor a las chicas
I'm so sad that this has been removed from spotify😢

Cuando traduzco los comentarios que le dejan a Doyeon me cuestiono si soy mala persona solo por reírme de Dalas calvo-
Pregunta seria, en la publicación reciente de Doyeon en instagram la están atacando porque creo que se rio de alguien calvo? Alguien sabe el contexto?  También la están atacando por ser la amiga de una chica que acaba de tener un escándalo-
Why are all the top comments under weki meki mvs like "I'm not a fan but-" "i don't even stan but-" STAN WEKI MEKI FOR GODS SAKE
ASTRO COMEBACK ON APRIL?!!!? THAT MEANS WEKI MEKI COMEBACK SOON
weki meki is not kpop, weki meki isnt just a group, its a genre in itself. weki meki is the past, the present and the future. weki meki paved the way they are the blue print of everything kpop is, they are above everyone and thats a fact.

Good night all
Let's talk about oopsy and its history line, oopsy is inspired in the movie Ocean's 8 if you haven't watched ocean's 8, Debbie Ocean (the protagonist) is trying to commit the heist of the century at the Met Gala in New York: she wants to steal a necklace valued at more than 150 million dollars with her 7 member team, in oopsy Lucy is Debbie Ocean and the necklace is represented as the feather that you can see many times on the mv, all the oopsy stages and concept photos are inspired by this movie!! (Especially this one: https://youtu.be/u7jt13u1ROk)

cool cool dijo weki meki
The more I listen to this the more I find things to talk about.  -Can we please appreciate the aesthetics? The huge painting, the table scene, the mannequins, the lighting, the editing they all scream HARD WORK. All this team that worked for all the details, I see all of their hardship. -And the lyrics. Empowering, strong,feminine, fresh, so cool. - Their face beauty. Could they be described as korean beauty standards? no. I love that. We need this in 2021 kpop. -I love that their slim figures was NOT what make them look cool. Read that again and keep in mind that last decade's kpop feminine-cool-successful videos was about the appearance. I am so glad I didn;t saw that here.  -I Love that their outfits are cool and well matched. We see different styles individually  but also the stylist chose the group outfits to be black and white (basic colors) full body suits. As if they wanted to point out that they respect their own style and personality but they are also a group/ a whole. - I looove so much that the accessories are unusual, but some of them are not so distinctive. At the same time their hair colors are a mix of casual style but then there are some hair accessories/ colors not so usual. I MEAN ONCE AGAIN SEEMS LIKE THE MESSANGE IS THAT WE RESPECT EVERY OPINION/STYLE/PERSONALITY and I loved that. That is cool. Also their nails. I am so tired of too much nail art and I LOVED the fact that some girls had pure clean natural color nails.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Fantagio dismissed all existing boards and appointed five new executive directors. The management was completely replaced.
⚠️⚠️⚠️ So fantagio has new management now, and the newly appointed directors works on production and Entertainment businesses.   That means different style of mvs and a different promotion team, let's hope these ones do their job properly 🤞

If you like: 𖥻 Loud beats, hip hop, teen crush (new concept in kpop invented by Weki Meki) • I don't like your girlfriend   If you like:  𖥻 Chill R&B, slow tempo • Youniverse • My World   If you like:  𖥻 Ballads, café type songs • D-DAY • Dear • Just Us • Petal Fortune   If you like:  𖥻 Disco music, work out songs • Fantastic

Okay so from what I have heard starplay is no longer for voting stuff. So now our main focuses should be the video mv and other voting apps. But which one should we as a fandom focus on bc we can’t we everywhere?!
This is my first time reacting to weki meki and holy shit? Everyone of them has such unique ass visuals like they’re SOOOOOOO different you really cannot say that “she reminds me of this idol” like no wth. And not to mention, the song sounds so different as well like the whole melody isn’t even familiar it’s soooooo catchy. For some reason the cinematography to this video is so on point, it grasps everyone’s attention EVEN the non-fans like me. The producers realllyyyy know what people outside the fandom want and would produce such a goosebumps-factor masterpiece. The structure of this song is all over the place but it somehow doesn’t sound messy AT ALL unlike most kpop releases. God this has to be my fave song of 2020, i cant believe that im missing out SOOOO much :(  Oh and btw who’s the girl in the far left at 1:40? She’s really pretty
Whoaaa Lua’s green hair looks so ‘COOL’ 😉
13,778,780
Who’s this girl 0:26 and who’s this girl 0:36 I’m think about stanning! ☺️
Impressive choreography tbh!!
I'm rewatching the cool stages and I just want to say that THIS IS THEIR MOST ICONIC ERA, MANY new fans, an amazing song, good mv (not as good as picky picky or lalala but it's on the top 3), Rina's iconic part, THE LUCIPE, Suyeon slaying the "every everyday i just wanna dance", Lua got many attention and went viral many times, Yoojung choreographied a part of cool, Doyeon looking pretty (as always 😙) and singing the chorus!, Elly gained confidence and is becoming our second main vocalist, Sei looked so pretty with that red dress, Rina and Sei's part together, THIS ERA IS JUST SO ICONIC.  The only thing that I didn't like of this era was Elly's extensions (i fucking hate you fantagio, you did my girl so dirty with that 😭) and the lack of Sei screentime :(
lucy's "recipe" is always so fun to listen to haha

Yall know what? I'm so ready for a next comeback, if we work together we can get their first win for sure, these days i've seen how other fandoms (of bigger groups) promote their favs on comebacks and here are my conclusions:  *Twitter* You can spam on twitter under kpop news (koreaboo, allkpop etc.) about the comeback, that's what mostly of the stan do, a lot of people will be interested if they see a bit of the teaser or the killing part of the mv, so please don't forget to add a video!!   *Instagram* Spam on people's dms on instagram, surprisly people respond to the messages and in most of the cases they are interested in stanning them!! (I already do this you can contact me there I'm @wekii_mekii 🙂)  *Tiktok* POST FANCAMS, also if your account is under 16 years they will make it private, so if you want to make them viral your account should be on +16! You can make tons of mutuals and when you post a video they will probably see it. Use many hashtags! It's a good way to make your video on other kpop stans fyp. Also, pls be careful people there are so annoying 💀  *Youtube* I know the kilings on the yt comment's sections already do this, and I think this is the most obviously among all but, whenever you see someone asking for help to stan them, be gentle and give them some songs recommendations or youtube videos (recommend good weki meki's channels like rosiy or crescent moon Lucy!), I have all the videos to get to know them on a playlist (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPIwdFWRyajd8J-dtG1AHU9auSYRL_Wk_) Also recommend people other tracks of the album (?) (if fantagio give us another single I'm suing them 💀) they might like the album and end up buying it.  You can also recommend the songs to your friends and family.  And enjoy the comeback and keep loving weki meki for sure :)
Go Go Go 14m Ki-lings 😊

Fighting girls
well hello im back again
Last time i listened to Weki Meki before tonight was when "i dont like your boyfriend" came out. I just didnt keep up. I just watched 7 MV and love them all plus the songs. They stand as the one group i like alm9ost every song from. im glad Lucy got more lines tho, cuz i think she only got like 7 words in " i dont like your gf" and then like 2 words in another song.  So im glad everyone is getting lines no.
This is gonna sound fucked up but i learned who weki meki is by Jennie that picture of Jennie with Doyeon blew up and i thought Doyeon was really pretty so i searched her up and now im here and i LOVE THIS SONG freaking SOTY material😍
This is so much a lesbian song
wekimeki world domination
WEKIMEKI LIGHTSTICK WHEN?
I cant wait for a comebackkk
QUEEN LUA.

Good afternoon:)
I like them, they are fresh and fun and talented but they always get shitty songs with no real catchy chorus just like talking? The deserve a banger
1:30 I'm still wondering who's whispering in this part. Is it a voice or a digitally made sound. Not sure, you can hear it clearly using earphones
I'm a new Ki-ling and I'm already obsessed with this song, Picky Picky and Crush! I can't wait to see these girls' blow up and get the recognition that they deserve. Doyeon is beautiful.   Ps. Are any of y'all looking for a new kpop forum to join? If so, come and join Hallyu Central! It's a legit site and I'm one of the users there (under Karinaknows). There's no toxicity. It's just a peaceful place to discuss Kpop and Asian media, in general. It's a growing community and everyone is friendly to each other! There's actually a group of Ki-lings on there that hype each other up and Wek Meki.
Almost 14M
Weki - Meki Euro - Java
https://youtu.be/aOFkpgjIFPM
Wish I knew who everyone was!!! They look so good
Ki-Lings let’s not become a fandom that dehumanizes Weki Meki. Female groups go through so much in the kpop industry so let’s not push things on them. As long as they are healthy and happy we should be happy for them. Let’s be a fandom that loves our girls and pushes them to do better not thinner or different (clothing, etc). In the end of the day, they are humans and have feelings!

Imaginen decirle fea a bebé Yoojung, urge un espejo para los haters.
Para ayudar al stream intercalen 4 MVs
Les recomiendo la cuenta de twitter de weki meki charts para estar al tanto de las chicas
¿Quieren ver a las chicas felices? Pues hagan stream y compartan info de Weki Meki para que el fandom crezca y lleguemos a las metas de stream
En el proximo comeback hay que darles su first win, las chicas se han esforzado mucho
ES QUE WEON USTEDES CACHAN LA PERFECCIÓN QUE SE CARGA WEKI MEKI, ES UN GRUPO SUPER COMPLETO

Weki Meki's discography it's the best representation of character development.

I get a feeling we’re getting a comeback soon so Kilings prepare yourselves!!!

Happy new year Weki Meki! Happy new year Ki-lings! Let's go for more!
fantagio's artists are so talentend yet no one knows about them i think they could do better to promote them well
Kim Soo Kyung is the love of my life, confirmed.
I can't believe I really ignored this. This is a literal masterpiece like wtf! Idk if it's just me but this beat and sound is very much giving me like UK vibes. High fashion like runway..Idk how to describe it but it's fire.
*Cool é a melhor música do Weki Meki, espero que elas continuem com esse conceito que provavelmente elas iram crescer bastante esse ano.*
*Let's go Ki-lings our girls deserve more!*
This song makes me want to stan Weki Meki

If you hate Weki Meki, just remember that Weki Meki spelled backwards is  ikem ikew which makes no sense just like your opinion 😋
Weki Meki, I love you!!!
How does 2021 feel? 😃 I'm still in 2020

at first i didn’t like it that much but now i’m obsessed and i think it’s their best title track
yes.it’s my favorite release of 2020.
my favorite weki meki song
I honestly don't know who any of these girls are but the one with short hair and green bangs is so charming and charismatic 😳
I Love This Song, this concepts suits them really well!
Chicocos, leí un comentario de abajo con planes por el próximo comeback de Weki Meki.  -Si es posible instalense tik tok para viralizar la nueva canción. -Publiquen fancams en tik tok o twitter, si pueden editarlas estaría facherito. -Sp4m33n a las personas con su nuevo comeback, preguntando si conocen a Weki Meki.  Resumen: *Hagamos lo posible para hacerlas virales*  De todas formas voy a publicar este comentario el próximo año xd  Kiling ❤💛 Weki Meki
Happy new year guys
Just keep streaming Just keep streaming Life isn't all that grim  Not with Weki Meki :)
For the next comeback we NEED to make them viral, KiLings install tiktok and post fancoms everywhere, created spam accounts and start asking people if they know Weki Meki and PROMOTE THEM AT ALL COSTS!!! WE CAN DO IT 💪
Hi kiling, I hope it doesnt bother you but could you please check red square colorful song they are on the verge of disbandment
soty
To believe the guy behind One-Winged Drip also made this track...I was wondering why this slaps so hard lol
Cute
🙆‍♀️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♀️💁‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙎‍♀️
With Gugudan's disbandment, we need to support weki meki 10x more now in terms of buying physical albums and streaming. If Cool didn't do well, I think this would've been the year they disbanded but thankfully this song saved them. In 2021, we need to try our best and give the girls their first win. Lets work hard k-lings <3
Ki-Lings let’s work harder on getting Weki Meki more attention. We are the only ones how can do it. Let’s do our parts guys! Save tickets everyday and str34m whenever you get the chance. LETS GIVE THESE GIRLS WHAT THEY DESERVE!!! Fighting ❤️✌️
I feel like after gugudan disbandment this group also 🥺
COOL
Thank you fantagio, you know that I hate you, but thank you 😔

i've been trying to find a comment about yoojung winking at the "take it easy" part, but couldn't find it. So, here's the comment.  She's freakin cute.
My best friend is a boy group stan and the only girl group that she stans is Weki Meki thanks to me 😌
no one: me at 3am: cOOL 좀 더 뜨겁게 감당 안되게 BRING IT BACK AYAYAYA
Cool
They did it for God and the gays
Imagine how it would be ! Im beautiful
I've been here since October who is the girl at the start she reminds me of Anda so much
Warning:You might stan them after watching this MV the rate of coolness is over 1000
COOL
I understand that they avoid to put the pop note in their hiphop style but doing something easy like Blackpink , Bigbang or 2ne1 isn't that bad, lastly everyone like something catchy to their ears.
Knowing bros fans come to Support Wekimeki..Panggawo😊😊

This is my second time listening to this song and this group. I usually don’t comment on songs that I just tumble on but THIS song was SO different and so unexpected from a group like WekiMeki.   ALSO, idk how their company managed to find such unique looking girls that you find yourself looking/ staring at them cuz each one of them has the unique beauty. ALSO, I’ve never seen anyone rock a pixie cut like that girl before.
girls are beautiful
I can’t stop watching this
Doyeon wauw.

Oh This Song sounds good
Aroha here
@James Smith do you have nothing better to do that you decided to spread hate into this healthy comment section. We all know they did that but I'm pretty sure they educated themselves since I haven't seen them sing that song ever again. The girls made this mistake but they have done so many things and shown that they support all community and that when singing that one song you are referring , they meant no harm by it. Weki Meki AND Astro loves their fans and they don't hate on anyone. Get your facts straightened out before insulting them to their fans faces.
I really really hope if there is a Queendom season 2 that Weki Meki can be there. This would definitely help them soooo much. PLZ Mnet Weki Meki on Queendom S2!! Manifest Manifest Manifest!!!!
This is for you lil bish @James Smith:  - Lua talked about racial injustices (60 minutes with Weki Meki interview).  - All of them support and always wear accessories from the store coolbreads, this store openly donate all their founds to blm (@coolbreadsofficial on instagram).  - On instagram stories, a fan told Lua: "I like you a lot but I'm a girl" and Lua's answer was this: "love has no boundaries" (@soo_kyungyi on instagram).  - Doyeon recommended to her fans movies in which the main romantic line is between the characters of the same sex (@lafilledhiver_ on instagram).  - All of them went to the musical "everybody's talking about Jamie", a gay musical with a drag queen as protagonist, and posted the photos on instagram (@suye.on2di, @_haerimida, @dbeoddl__, @lafilledhiver_, @seiric_o, @soo_kyungyi on instagram) (when they posted the pics Rina and Lucy didn't have personal instagram accounts).  - Doyeon recommended Troye Sivan's song "Heaven". This song is about coming out of the closet and lgbt rights (@lafilledhiver_ on instagram).  - Weki Meki supported Sleeq's performance with her song "here i go", this song talked about lgbt rights (the show good girl on YouTube).  - Lua recommended the Doinne Warwick's album "Make way for Doinne Warwick" an album that talked about her live and how she became famous even being a poc (@Weki_Meki on Twitter).  Think again before comment stupid things.
Let's report James Smith, here we go again 😃🔫
Their best song ever
Deserve 100m
Weki Meki have mocked Indians several times and possibly mocked Japanese or old people as well. Weki Meki and Astro have even sang the Curry song last year!
So cool🤟

This song is really good, I'm an Astro fan but I was never into weki Meki until this song, hopefully Fantagio sees this song getting more attention than most of their past songs (Sales dropped tho) and continue to use this kind of concept bcs this is a step to a right direction

STAN WEKI MEKI EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS GREAT IM NOT SAYING THEY ARE PERFECT BUT COME ON THEY DESERVE SOME MORE APPRECIATION
Ki-lings, what's your favorite song from New Rules? Mine is sweet dreams :)
Weki Meki had an interview with a mexican magazine, since spanish is my first language, I traduced the interview to english so ki-lings around the world can understand it <3 Here is it: 2020 seems to be the busiest year for Weki Meki already with her third comeback, plus all of the songs they've shown are known to be very energetic. Was it difficult to work with songs full of energy?   YOOJUNG: It's difficult because it's a choreography full of energy, but I felt like I had to cheer up our Ki-Ling; thinking about that I tried even harder on stage. Yes, it is difficult, but I think I was grateful to everyone and for that I really enjoyed it.  RINA: We feel comfortable and we are very excited to get our energy out on stage. We also have fun with each other, I'm glad we are comfortable aroud each other and can focus on the stage. Every part is physically tired, but it was nice to enjoy it, as well as to make the introductions and expressions.   The new song "COOL" gives a different girl crush feeling than previously shown, gives an "expert" vibe in the industry. How did you feel about this new concept, was it cool?  SEI: When I first heard "COOL", it seemed like a very intense song and a bit darker than what we had been doing. It was a melody with a different concept that we had not tried, so I had many doubts, so I put a lot of effort so that it had our essence. I am so proud and happy that many fans accepted and liked it with the unique touch of Weki Meki. It was very cool!   After "The Paradise" from the HIDE and SEEK album, Suyeon has a new song of your own on this album.  What inspired or empowered you to compose "Just Us"? Did you have any difficulties?  SUYEON: Yes, on the last album "The Paradise" was a song that we wanted to compose with the sound of Weki Meki; this time we thought about writing a melody that we needed and that we wanted. So I wrote Just Us, thinking that it would be nice if we had a song that we could sing with our Ki-Ling at concerts later on.   So what was the song you most enjoyed recording? Tell us your funny anecdotes! (:   ELLY: "COOL". I remember when we recorded the English version of "FACTS (COOL Eng. Ver.)", I think it was the first time I recorded an English version, it was interesting and fun.   DOYEON:  Recording "100 FACTS" was the most fun, since I like English, recording a whole song in this language was a lot of fun for me.   'COOL' seems to have a strong meaning of Let's get out of the monotonous life in a cool way! Besides that, is there a message that Weki Meki wants to convey to her fans in other New Rules songs?    LUCY: Among the songs on the album is 100 FACTS, The English version of COOL. Originally, the demo version was in English, so it conveys the sentiments better, so I'd like to recommend it.   Is there a song that you would like your fans to hear from your new album? Why?    YOOJUNG: I would like to recommend Just Us. It contains memories of the time when we were trainees, as well as the love we have for each other; apart Suyeon composed it, and Rina, Lucy and me participated in the lyrics. So it is a very meaningful song.    LUA: I want you to listen to Just Us. The lyrics contain our memories from before we were Weki Meki to the present. I think if they listen to this song they will get closer to us.   Weki Meki has shown a variety of musicality.  Are there any other genres that you would like to try? How about Latin style music?   SUYEON: Since the eight members of Weki Meki have different personalities, we don't want to pigeonhole ourselves into one musical genre, we always want to show you new sides of our music.  Latin style music is really fascinating and charming; if we have the opportunity, we also want to sing in Latin style.   Any songs that you listen to frequently recently?  Of course, for K-Magazine it's "COOL" by Weki Meki. (:   ELLY: These days I listen to a lot of "Can't Sleep" by Jang Beom-June. I love the emotionality of this song, that's why I keep it on repeat all the time.   RINA: Lately I've been listening to "Without All the Traces of Time" by 015B.   If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would you like to go?    LUA: More than saying a country, I want to see and enjoy different cultures, that's why I want to travel the world! Instead of thinking first of 'I want to go' without knowing about the country, I prefer to go around the world, accumulate a lot of experience, and think 'I want to go again' to that part.   It may be a bit difficult given the current situation, but would you like to visit Mexico later? If so, what would you like to do the most?  Fans from Mexico and South America are always waiting for Weki Meki's visit!    SEI: I really want to go! I love Mexican food very much. I especially like quesadillas and guacamole, to the extent that I sometimes make guacamole to eat in the bedroom. If I have the opportunity, it is one of the countries that I want to visit, so yes or yes I want to meet the Ki-Ling of Mexico and create good memories.   What factor do you think makes Weki Meki look a little cooler than other groups?    LUCY: I think the element that makes Weki Meki cool is our presentation. As our coordination is good on stage, I feel like we can show them a perfect performance, I think we really do it perfect.   In "COOL", the next part is impressive: "We can change the rules, get rid of the boring ones". What are some boring rules for Weki Meki? What do you think this letter means to those who hear it little?  DOYEON: I think everyone has a convention that they want to break. For example, I like this style of clothing, but people's comments make me wonder if I really do, or I like a song, but they say "Do you listen to those kinds of songs?", And you feel that you cannot proudly say that you are. I hope that all of us who have had such an experience can escape the monotonous rules, and have the confidence to live our way.

É impressionante como a fantagio caga pra o Weki Meki, cara são 8 meninas extremamente talentosas com um conceito que faz sucesso na Coreia músicas boas e contagiantes, coreografia incríveis vocais impecáveis porém com uma péssima administração é pra piorar o público só foca em grupos com o conceito girl crush ou grupos de empresas grandes, eu me recuso a acreditar que um dia o Weki Meki irá acabar é não vão conseguir chegar no topo pelo menos uma vez.
the make up is pretty dope cool mv 👍
I don't like them so much like other groups, but this song is so addictive lol.
im not even a weki meki stan but this song is one of the best of 2020

are you really a ki ling if your bias wrecker isn't lucy
I love these girls sm
I feel so comfortable in this comment section, unlike how I feel In other groups' mv's as if I'm meant to be here
I miss this comment section
haven't streamed in a while
I'M BACK
This song is such a bop
Ki-Ling fighting!!!!!!
Even though the concept seems similar to OOPSY this mv is way better, the song is really catchy and gives a runway vibe, I really liked it but the outfits... Come on, you could have done better stylists. I feel like that plain white jumpsuit/mono clothing kills the vibe, also the outfits in 1:33 feel so early 00's I don't even know how they thought the song had a retro vibe or something? Everything is COOL, except for those two outfits
For potential new fans: Sei is eco-friendly, eats only organic food and her diet is mostly on vegan based and uses products without chemicals (products that are environmental and animal friendly). She visits to learn about zero waste lifestyle, she even has a section on vlive called EAT-PLAY-HEALTHY, when she cook and eat vegan food, play games, do crafts, talk with Ki-lings and invite members, I highly recommend them!
This song is honestly so underrated! It deserves better recognition
It hurts me to know how underrated Weki Meki is 😔💔

Seeing bad comments, will only make me feel annoyed. What's wrong with the mindset of all of you? If you are not perfect yourself, stop insulting someone. Are you guys better than them? Not! Only fools are happy when other people feel hurt. Stop doing stupid things like that, they are a great group, please respect their work. And sorry if my words are too harsh, but I think it's a fact, sorry.

2:40 is my fav part of the song
Weki Meki won an award today with ASTRO💜
OH YEA THE VIEWS IS GETTING BIGGER
Weki Meki has create 2 concept... I wonder if they will create a concept like an national anthem? I mean, like Sasageyo, the Opening Song of Attack on Titan.

5 songs for new fans: - Crush - Iron boy - THE PARADISE - True Valentine - Sweet Dreams Have a great week!
This is one of the best songs in kpop from 2020 hands down. It deserves so much more. I don’t apply that to a lot of songs, but there have been showstoppers this year like gfriends Apple and chunghas stay tonight and cool by weki meki is definitely one of them.

I’m not a Weki Meki stan but I was a Produce 101 fan~ I followed season 1 and 2 alum and after awhile losing touch I’m curious at how the season 1 girls are doing so I googled them and was surprised at the number of album sales for Weki Meki newest album. What the hell happened with Fantagio?   This song is a bop! and the sales for this album decreased drastically from their first album. I hate when talented group is underrated. They have Doyeon and Yoojung for god’s sake, can’t Fantagio just promote them better so they can bring the group up like they did before? 😔
_every, every dαy, i just wαnnα dαnce~_  so true, but i'm lαzy 😔
thank you i literally forgot to breathe

This is, in my opinion, their best title track. It’s very *cool*
If I was the director I would of added the paintball effect on those white outfits for more impact with each dance move. I think that would of looked awesome 😅

OMG  Rina looks like 渡邊直美  so much
all im saying is weki meki's stylists are always on it!! i've never seen a weki meki hairstyle that i dislike, and their stylists like experimenting with new outfits and haistyles too! like, lua's pixie cut. i dont usually see short hair like that in kpop but she really pulls it off!

i'm happy they gained more fame this comeback, i think everyone here knows how they fought for it, their career had a lot of up and downs, they had the smash hit i don't like your girlfriend and then it just faded out, then after almost two years they recovered it with picky picky but a few months later weme losted their hype, the public seemed to be not that interested with their sound, but then cool came and i think is secure to say that at least internationally they're in their best days ever, hope they get 1st win next comeback, we were close than never in cool's era. ♥
Try listen it on TV yall... It's freaking different in good way somehow...
이렇게 잘하는데 어떻게  아는형님에 한번도 못나왔지??ㅠㅠ

Something about this song has an early 2000s vibe
Who's the girl with the green hair? She's handsome 😳

WHAT IS THE REASON FOR NOT STANNING WEME AND THEM BEING SO UNDERAPPRECIATED/RATED???  weme needs a win now 😔

Fantagio, please don’t neglect Weki Meki after you debut your new girl group. Weki Meki members have worked really really hard, and have the talent and good personalities to make it big. Please don’t waste their talent and star power.
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU
Cool
Yall... i've heard a new that Fanta is going to debut a new girl group today.... Like- god, Fanta, take care for ASTRO and WeMe carefully. When they have a notice they deserve then you can do whatever you want!
0:41 why she look liked Yuna from itzy??!!!💗
COOL
😍Weki Meki’s vocals are amazing! All of them have clear and pleasant voices, which is very rare in the Kpop industry
Weki Meki really is one of the most talented groups out there❤️their execution of the choreo is breathtaking: they dance with power but also with fluidity. And they all have that star aura that cannot be faked.

You know our style. It has a unique color.  YAZZZ WEKI MEKI LOUDER SO THAT HATERS CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE JUST YOURSELVES AND NOT COPYCATS. COPYCATS ARE NOT COOL. WEKI MEKI IS COOL SO THEY ARE NOT COPY CATS!

I've commented on this comment section like 91839th times how long DO I have to wait for this to turn 20k
Among us is popular rn but honestly I got bored 😔
Choke me like you hate me but you love me
All their songs are bops
This song still doesn't sound like other songs after I've streamed this like 0182928th times and you know what I love that
I love every aspect of them
I found them amidst Covid yk what I don't regret stanning them
I hate online school
Im supposed to be doing work rn....
Lucy's rap lines can kill me
I love Yoojung's first rap lines
Sei nailed this
I hope in the new cb Rina will have long hair and Doyeon will have short hair,,, I wanna see more Yojung with short hair too!
A lot of people noticed Lua but no one can deny the fact this is Suyeon's era
I've noticed a lot of people notice Lua and I love that
My fave songs of theirs are True Valentine, Moya Moya, Lalalala, Tiki Taka, and basically everything but mostly those
I love all their songs honestly
based on other comebacks their new cb will be on Dec-Feb? or they'll take a hiatus though I doubt that
I wonder when their comeback will be
weki meki <333333333
Weki Meki is coming hard ......💕🇰🇷

Doyeon was my first bias but then I found Rina often caught my attention so she became my bias and on the other hand my bias wrecker is Lucy
Lucy pls tell me,, what's ur recipe,,,
I'm still not over Lucy's recipe
Honestly IDK how I decided to Stan them, I just found myself memorizing their names 👁️👄👁️
I started stanningvthem bc of doyeon, I saw her act on her recent Web Drama then I realised she was in a gg
I discovered them 1 month after their popsy mv release
I love them
I'm hungry
excited for new cb they better get their win
COOL
HHHHH ok i only just decided that i should go out of my way to listen to Weki Meki because previously i had come across some of their songs and found them really nice. But omg i have been watching this mv all day. It really is just so cool and it sounds so good. Bruh i'm excited to listen to their other songs now. Can't believe i've been sleeping on these gems.
I'm begging to you all, pls keep supporting WeMe's until next cb, so we can get their 1st win :")

I know a lot of us feel disappointed that Weki Meki didn’t get their first win, but that’s why we must continue str3@ming. By str3@ming, we can let WeMe and other Ki-lings know there are still many who support WeMe, so there’s hope for WeMe to get their first win next time
11,709, 746 👌👌👌❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍 Suyeon, Rina, Sei
Jesus Lua, calm down.

Wow I just can't with Lua, she's so pretty!!! And she has lots of lines, I'm so happy for her <3
I made a short version of this song, if yo guys want to check it :)
People who disliked this MV is because they are not *COOL* like Weki Meki
Picky picky in one year - 11m views Cool in two weeks - 10m views ♡
Ok but, I don't even stan them, but I might begin to stan them soon... because like... they are so underrated.
Hi Ki-lings, CLC made the cool challenge. I would live if you check it♡♡ Tysm and fighting for 1st win! https://youtu.be/5-iVMac1V34

Ay ay yah
Ttarawa
Can we appreciate lucy a little bit, like shes so ethereal
I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS
Huh, Weki Meki isn't usually my style but his song is indeed cool.
As international fans, i love girlcrush or badass concept than cute concept. So far, I think this is the best Weki Meki song. They need more attention from global fans.
โดนตกจากเพลงนี้🥰🥰🥰
this is actually very good! this needs more attention ❣️
Wow, its really coooolll
Something abt this song is just so pulling. I just want to keep listening to it. Even though I don't stan them yet.
Cadê as pessoas from brazil pra dominar isso aq???
사랑해
미친 개멋있다.. 숨멎을거 같어
Who's that girl with green short hair? I like her
This is one of the best songs I've ever heard. I loved Weki Meki after hearing DAZZLE DAZZLE and was looking forward to hearing them again. This absolutely blew me away. It literally gave me chills and had my heart racing. From start to finish this song is so engaging and exhilarating. I am such a fan of theirs after this now. October 2020 will already forever be the greatest month in the history of music after BLACKPINK and LOONA's stunning comebacks. This amazing group and song joining that adds so much to this historic time too. I love these amazing girls so much! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

노래 존나 좋아....
간지쩐다미친...
와 근데 이번 앨범 반응 장난아닌거같네요 외국팬들 댓글 엄청 많아
노래 또 들으러 왔어요 퍼포먼스 너무 멋있어....
멋있다
I'm still amaze in every weki meki song. I always love their instrumentals accompany by their vocals and rapper.
Let’s gooo
노래 개좋다
¡Me encanta!
컨셉 너무 멋있다 ... 의상 컨셉 노래 안무 사박자 오박자 미쳤어여
Buddy here to support weki meki. this is bop!
how can i not realized lua's handsomeness :'( im melting <3
soty!!!!
They're really cool in this cb.. this kind of concept is better on them more than cute concept
Poor group, uneven member popularity. I really believe in 2021 this group will disband 😬🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That concept change thoooo
Man!!!! The Next Twice or Blackpink! LOVED!
I WANT TO STAN THEM HELPPPP
FILIPINO FANS ANYONE? 🇵🇭💪😍
I understand that KPOP songs come out when the birth of one of the members of that band is near, but except BP, BTS, TWICE
와 이번 컨셉 진짜 멋있다;;
컨셉 대박 좋다
Vamos por los 12 millones <3
Why is zendaya in this group?
Not a fan but this is the best WEKI MEKI's song
노래 개좋음
이번 릴댄도 기대하고 있어요ㅎㅎ 요번 컨셉 멋있대서 처음으로 뮤비보러 왔어요!!
컨셉 찰떡
DOYEON IS SO PRETTY
위키미키
so cool!
Coming here after everything that happened after ioi and post ioi groups, I'm definitely rooting for wekimeki. Its sad but their concept right now wouldve been similar to pristin (after pristin v) if they are still active. Imagine the girl power if both were active as well as gugudan. :( Bittersweet but wekimeki fighting!!
LUA's HAIR IS EVERYTHING THIS ERA AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME OTHERWISE
와 미쳤다
I hope they keep giving Lua more lines. A lot of people asked about who she is during this era. She deserves more screentime too.
O poder do Weki Meki ❤️
Alright I’ve checked Pentagons first win box this year.  Now I want to be able to do the same for Weki Meki, Dreamcatcher, A,C.E etc
If they keep with this type of aesthetic,sound,music...they are going to be HUGE trust me ✨
And I keep coming... I swear I´ve never seen these visuals before  I´m so so so so in love with them
this hits hard
Por que ninguém fala da Lua??? Ela é de longe a integrante mais original da Weki Meki.  Ela é única, tem personalidade, tem versatilidade. Tem pouco reconhecimento porque talvez as pessoas gostem mais do mesmo de sempre. Eu a amooo e vou protegê-la.  ❤
*Lua It deserves more lines and prominence!*
CoolでWeki Meki沼ハマって、Crushに行って抜け出せなくなった
I'd like to thank weki meki for never letting me down
vamos por los 12M!!!
YOOJUNG MARRIAGE ME
Road to 12M let’s go

I played this song whilst trying to get rid of a cockroach in my room. Now all I can think of when I hear this song is that cockroach. Which is not nice at all because this slaps. But no... MR CoCkRoAcH haS tO ruIn iT
I all of time watching this when I wake up
I all of time watching this when I wake up cool
Hello guys, vote on Weki meki here ^^ https://www.mwave.me/en/
How did the views just freeze at 11 million I-
I want to stan them. Can someone help. I realy like the girl with the short hair and the one holding wine.
doesn't really follow weki meki but that doyeon's part at the intro hits hard dayumm.
Dance so Gentle Energized
How is this still at 11 million? Weki Meki is always delivering bops and working so hard. Why are they still underrated it makes me honestly mad... This song is very good. I mean this concept is unique for girlgroups and I love how weki meki always gives unique sounding songs. I hope they continue with songs like this that can be implied to both girl and boy groups. I like girlgroups with unique and different concepts like Loona and F(x) I just wish they get more recognition.  What will be their real breakthrough because even 3 comebacks a year isn't enough for the kpop community.
Weki meki has some of the best songs! I
They deserve more in this era ㅠㅠ
I liked them
Weki Meki the brightest star!!!

Hey, Ki-Lings! ^_^ Aroha here. Since Arohas have been helping to str34m and vote for Weki Meki, it would be nice if Ki-Lings could help Arohas vote for Astro for the MTV EMAs. It's a really big deal and it will really help Astro to get more attention and recognition. It's super easy--you don't need to make an account or login or anything like that, you just need to click the "vote" button and you can vote every 5 seconds (voting is unlimited)! So, if you guys could help us vote for Astro for the EMAs, we Arohas would really, really appreciate it! Vote as much as you can here (but don't use auto-clicker!): https://www.mtvema.com/ko-kr/artists/astro   Fighting, Ki-Lings! Hopefully Weki Meki and Astro can start getting the attention and recognition they deserve! ^_^
This is one of those songs that takes a while to get into your head, it’s so good once you get used to the song.
Está canción es arte igual que weki meki
COOL SOTY

위키미키 노래 중 처음으로 좋다고 느꼈다 음방 많이나오고 1등했으면
me: -listen cool- oh that's good... also me: -listen 100 facts- woah I can sign that and me: -listen cool singing 100 facts and listen 100 facts singing cool- hablo español asi que orto
포스 미쳤다;; 개멋있고 쿨하자나

Who's the girl w/ short hair???
this song gives me so much adrenaline oh my gosh, I always feel like beating the shit out of someone
WTF

I love this song so much!

Weki meki queens

Hey Weki Meki fandom, could you guys please go check out Saturdays songs Bbyong and D.B.D.B.DIB. The CE0 put out letter stating the company is having economic problems during this hard time. He also treats Saturday like his own children. Most companys don't treat thier idols that way.  They still managed to have a comeback with a low budget, they even got to create and design their own stage outfits. Please consider stanning Saturday and dont let this group go in vain.  How many more groups are we gonna let flop   ps. This wasn't an attack to Weki Meki or the fandom because I'm loving this group but to put it bluntly wake the fuck up people
my angels are STUNNING!! every time, they come back and shock me because of how amazing they are
im streaming this and loona help😭
I LOVE U WEME
LUUAAAAA
정말 멋있다 노래도 좋고 의상이 편하니 춤에 더 눈이가고 넘 좋다!!! 쿨하다!!💜
전주부터 심장 때리고 지나감
DOYEON SHINED SO MUCH HERE I LOVE HER
this is so so good
Idk who the binch with the green hair is, but she can top me any time
I am a BTS ARMY 💜💜. But this song is really addictive.  I can't stop listening to it.. They all are very talented...
The choreo, the music video and the song, it reminds me of a boy group concept. Like how when I see what boy groups do, this is what I see. Damn, they are stepping up the bars.
this is luα's erα...
11,509,637 to 12 M and Crush MV 😘😍❤👌
Their songs are always some of the most musically interesting and unique songs I’ve heard.
So cool:(

I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH OMG
the song is so catching especially the first verses to the pre-chorus 😭
The 2 people called "Fritisa Rio" and "An lê" that called weki meki ugly will pay the consequences 🥰
Queens

이번 컨셉 넘 멋지고 좋네요

Fantagio is very serious about promoting Weki Meki, but the fact is that until now it has not been popular. they have frequent comebacks. but did not get satisfactory results. I think personally they are talented & have a good song every comeback. but weki meki members don't have more appeal & visuals, weme only has 2 famous members
유정님은 언제부터 그렇게 랩을 잘하셨나요? 펜이에요♡ 만능유정 사랑해요♡♡
Doyeon yoojung play drama don't forget to watch it guyss^^
I am a universe and came here to tell you that Weki Meki is such a great group also! I am hoping for their first win soon! They are all amazing!
2:41 랩하는 멤버 목소리 너무 좋아 이부분 10번째 반복중 ㅋㅋㅋ
ㅁㅊ 노래 춤 컨셉 다 좋다
위키미키 데뷔때부터 꾸준히 성장하는 모습 너무 좋아요 응원해요 😃💗
Ohh that rap is amazing
doyeon is so pretty omfg
good song
일단 노래가 너무 좋고 컨셉도 멋있어
컨셉사랑해 평생가자
cool!! 😍🎶
go 12M
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHO THE ONE WITH THE REALLY SHORT HAIR IS (from my profile you can see I'm a huge fan of short haired females)
Finally getting the views they deserved!
Oppsy was really good but it’s still stuck at 4 million views I was so surprised when I saw 11 million views just in one week on COOL!! They are growing !! CONGRATS weki meki !!
omg....11 Million views oh my god congrats Weki Meki !!!
they deserve betterr
they're so fking pretty omg
멋있어 최고야 위키미키
Lleguemos a los 15M!!vamos q se puede:)
i am not a Ki-ling, but Su-yeon really brought me back here again and again. She is really attractive in this MV.
개좋다 진짜
This is such a minor thing to notice but in the mv, towards the end when Doyeon sings the chorus and the girls are like paired up, she is paired up with Yoojung in the mv but during the live stages she is paired up with Lua. I wonder why they changed that. Maybe the height difference? Lol
어떡하지 너무 멋있어 진짜 미친거 같아 컨셉부터 노래 춤까지 다 완벽해 피키피키부터 점점 성장하는 모습이 너무 좋아 위키미키 사랑해
Yall just gave them hope at the beginning like you were going to stream harder this time. Everything was going right. We had 4 million in 2 days but we have been on 11 million for days now. Y'all wack lowkey including me
위키미키 팬 아닌데 컨셉 너무 맘에 들어서 팬 될 것 같아요.. 판타지오 일 진짜 잘하네..
개애애애애멋있다 컨셉 사랑해요
컨셉 너무좋고 노래 너무좋고 안무 너무좋고 위키미키 더더좋고 위밐 흥해라~~~~!!!

후렴에 음을 넣었다면 얼마나 더 좋았을징... 따라부르기는 힘든것 같아요 그래도 노래 좋네요ㅜㅜ
지하철에서 광고 나오길래 찾아옴 칼군무 빡시게 잡았더라구요 노래도 있지 느낌 나는데 그보다 좋은듯 물론 제 개인적인 취향이에요 원래 위키미키 노래 내 취향 아니었는데 이 노랜 개좋네

Vote Weki Meki now in Starplay Vote end in Tuesday 3PM
The predictions say Weki Meki will lose with a difference of 3500 points if Weki Meki gets the 1000 points of live voting we grow and get 5000 points in the final score if we get the 1500 points of broadcast what is super hard to get the ranking grow at 6500. I really don't know if we will win or not and the predictions said Pentagon have 80% of chances to get the win

BEST COMEBACK. THIS FITS THEM SO WELL!!
Đây giống như một màn tái xuất hơn là một sự trở lại, các cô gái đã thực sự lột xác với thái độ mới, âm thanh mới, tính cách mới. Tôi đã từng nghĩ doyeon và yoojung hơn hẳn những người khác, nhưng ở đây họ đều để lại dấu ấn mạnh mẽ trong tâm trí tôi. Bài hát là một tuyệt tác, tôi sẽ say sưa / say sưa và nghe phiên bản nhạc cụ (🤣) nó hay quá. Đoạn phim, tia chớp? Quần áo?? Nâng cao hơn nhiều. Tình yêu tình yêu tình yêu.  READ MORE

2020: Female Idols cut their hair. Male Idols grow their hair.
So I've been having a discussion with my friend trying to figure out how to describe this video. I'm genuinely curious what would you say this style of mv is? I see it as a very high fashion mv. But if you where to describe it as a concept what would anyone say this is?
the views going up soooooo slowly :( we have less than 24 hours DON'T STOP
0:24
This is more like re-debut rather than a comeback, the girls really slapped with new attitude, new sound, new personalities. I used to think doyeon and yoojung kinda outshined the others, but here they’re all left some strong marks in my mind. The song is masterpiece, i would go high/drunk and listen to the instrumental version (🤣) it’s that good. The video, the lightning? The clothing?? Much much more elevated. Love love love.
We got 18k on 4 hours omg this is bad, please keep streaming for them!!
I really want to trace Weki Meki's views as I really find it confusing to have such slow progress of increase since last Monday. Please help me guys if you see this comment, thank you!   Please do the viewstamp on this format (make sure that it is in Korean standard time): October 16, 2020 (6:21 AM): 11,157,113
STR  AM       E
ugh the way they just slay any concept given to them. talented queens
people's complaining about the fact that they won 8M views just because fantagio bought the views but... can y'all stfu for a second? i don't care if they bought it at all, they just finally invested in them and they won tons of popularity thanks to this, even the non stans comment here all the time, 90% of the comments are about people asking for their info cause they wanna stan and they won like 20k subscribers since the day this came out so please :)
It was unexpectedly great and I've got insta to thank for finding them

Hello, ki-lings! Great job so far this week but we just entered the FINAL 24 HOURS of the tracking week for The Show (except voting).  This means we have to double our efforts today, stream the MV as much as you can and collect as many as votes as you can. Let's do it for Weme!

HOW DO THEY DO IT HOW DO THEY ALWAYS GIVE US SUCH BOPS AAAA
[HANTEO] 201015 | 23:30 KST  Weki Meki <NEW RULES> 106 copies (2,504 total) [4th Day]
I think the fans of Weki Meki can all agree when I say that, mostly Fantagio was probably waiting for Lucy to get older to get to a more mature concept. I also think that OOPSY was kind of their "transition" for this, and I JUST LOVE THIS COMEBACK! I think they were overall trying a different kind of music, where they couldn't make too much in the beginning. But now, I think if they actually get to this vibe and make it for WeMe, the only way is up, imo.
10 M views in one week 💪❤️
1 week and 11 million? :0
esse começo com a Doyeon e Lucy amei muito aaaaaaaa
Do not stop. Keep working hard to stream until tomorrow to count points on the show
*Nae meotdero hae naneun nadapge!*

😈✌️🖤✨🇦🇷✨🖤✌️😈
PENTAGON IS THE KING, THERE IS NO DOUBT
Weki Meki really has climbed my favorites list substantially. Each song has a wonderfully interesting and stylish flavor. Good job, music producers.
this mv makes me stan them and my bias are Lua,Elly and Suyeon but all of the other members are my bias wreck especially to Rina and Luna, Doyeon and Yoojung I knew them already (I.O.I and my ultimate bias is Yoojung but this group? hmm Lua makes me stan to them) like when I watched their previous mv's Elly's vocal it was so good and also Suyeon was also have good vocals. Lua was so stand out the most with her green highlight and also her cuteness.  : after I watched this for the first time I searched for them so fast...but before I stan them I watched their Oopsy and Dazzle but this song makes me stan to them... got me? 555
윜밐 사랑해💙뮤비보면서 이렇게 온몸에 전율오는 건 첨이다😭❤️ 바지 입으니까 더 자신감이 넘쳐보이구 무대 다 씹어먹을듯 당당한 표정 여자답고 멋있어요!!💙 이번곡 가사랑 컨셉 진심 대박입니다ㅠㅠ 코디님 어디계세요 절드리고 싶어요bb❤️위키미키 대박나자💙💙💙
This easily ultimately became my favorite weki meki song!!!
por fin weki meki esta recibiendo el apoyo que siempre merecio
Weki Meki the born again...its really really good OMG I Love Weki Meki
Come on ki-ling don't stop streaming We have to get them their 1st win

Weki meki lagu nya enak semua
This is COOL I really love all weki meki songs and the fact is that they don't have any bad songs that is COOL <33
Weki Meki has been on my radar for a while but this comeback has me shook.
무릎 꿇고 봤다...
They are all my crushes
This is their sound, their style, the girls are really slaying this comeback
Yet another thing that reminded me that this is STIL Weki Meki: 3:15 the energy and synchronization they put in ALL of their choreographies! (sorry if I mispelled something) Let's go Ki-lings!
BEST COMEBACK
10 940 765
10M in less than a week. Congrats wekimeki

Literally addicted to this song
Fantagio is doing a great job with our girls!
90k to pass I don't like your girlfriend!!! Keep streaming
One of the best songs of 2020, the first rap killed me
Weme well done come on and get 20M
Views and Viewers are Frozen
I just reach 1000 comments....damn
What if we spam people on twitter with this mv? 😸
In my opinion, aside from the rap liners, Suyeon is the one who shined the most in this comeback. Given her powerful vocals, she got lots of center here thus highlighting her amazing dance moves too. There's also the iconic bridge part, she slayed it along with Sei. And lastly, her visuals also stood out specifically her smile and expressions. Nevertheless, I must say I am impressed by each and everyone of them, no one was lacking. This is definitely, absolutely their best comeback to date after Picky Picky Era. I still feel like they should've got their first win with Picky Picky, but it's never too late for a first win, so hoping for them to get their first win with COOL! Fighting Weki Meki and Ki-lings!
THE VIEWS ARE SO SLOW!!!!! PLEASE STREAM!!!! KILINGS!!!!
I hate the fact Weki Meki is the only Kpop group who sales are less  in every comeback like in the first album they sold 4K in the first day in the second album sold like 3K and in the third sold 2k and now  4th album sold  1K and I don't understand why WeMe songs are amazing and the best this year but now the sales are so bad even the rookies from new companies are selling more. WeMe deserve the same success than big groups they are Queens they deserve more

Please continue watching, the views aren't frozen, they're probably just slow because we aren't streaming like we're supposed to do. Our competition is getting closer and closer, if we keep at this slow rate we will LOSE even at SNS points

How do you get over this song?   Answer: never ♡
On the first listening I think this song isn't as catchy as their other title tracks and I feel weird when this song appeared on my spotify but after watching the mv it gets much cooler I hope this brings them luck

연말에 뮤직비디오 상이든 퍼포먼스상이든 둘중 하나는 좀 줘라ㅠㅠㅠ 이번 년도 걸그룹중에 퍼포먼스 젤 짱인데..
개쌉멋지네...
Not a fan but have been following them since debut. Hope they could get a win and shine this time!!! They r really precious!!

Lets go to 11M♡ *20M* *soon* *kilings*
10M vi3ws YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHGG
와 노래 시작부터 터지더라니 떡상하네ㅔㅔ 위키미키 팟팅 이왕 일케된거 나머지 명곡들도 다 떴으면 ㅜㅜㅜ
lucy and doyeon voices at the beginning of the song are so sensual! it's refreshing because I am sick of companies making the girls singing like KIDS WTF they are women not little girls.. except for yuna(itzy), she's a baby
That walk @ 2:33 they literally said WE ARE WEKI MEKI AND WHAT ABOUT IT💅🏽✨
I love the choreo it’s so different in the way that it’s less girly and not just about being cute or sexy. Like this could even be a guy choreo. If that makes sense
10 MILLION VIEWS!!!!!!! 😍😍
Unpopular opinion: Lua looks better with short hair
20m
Yass, we finally got 10 million views, I'm crying :((
Keep going everyone! Share with your friends, get the word out. We need as many people streaming as possible! If everyone watches the video 20 times each that's an easy two million not including new people  finding it and steaming as well. Ki-Lings fighting! Let's get these girls to their first win, they deserve one so much.
AAAAL FIN 10M
Can't stop watching this! Top-notch sound, spectacular choreo, and last but not least, powerful, yet charming girls. Good work.
10 million views in less than a week🤧💜.
Impressionada com a produção desse MV! MÚSICA MARAVILHOSA, visuais perfeitos, adorei.
Me siento orgullosa, nos tomó solo días en llegar a las 10 M, ahhh qué emoción
I still can’t get over on yoojung’s rap at the beginning. Btw I’m a new fan, this is probably one of my regrets not stanning them from the beginning but right now I’m here ready to stan. I’m a fan of ioi but after they disband I never checked out weki meki but now here I am “a new Ki-Ling”.
10Mil in 5 days! These girls crushing all expectations 💪🏼
1:41 Lua looks so hot omg that jawline
와아 천만뷰 넘었어ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
❤️ 1000만 달성 진짜진짜 축하해 ❤️
Congratulations for the 10M they deserve this and thw whole world

10 Million, Congratulations!
How we can download Cool? Because we need a lot of downloads if we want a win. Pentagon is leading in digitals and Sales and Weki Meki is only leading in vi2ws and maybe we will lead in pré and live voting but guys stop focus in vi2ws now, If the app Genie is available in your country stream Cool there and ignore the vi2ws for now, I'm saying this because Genie is not available in my country
YESSS WE DID IT!!! 10 MILLION!!! LETS NOT STOP HERE AND KEEP GOING!!!
This is their fastest song to hit 10 million. That's amazing, these girls are finally getting the recognition they deserved since the very beginning. I know for a fact this is going to be their most viewed music video. I hope the Continue to grow at this fast pace

Slowly or Fre3ze(╥_╥)
No offense but Weki Meki didn't follow or plagiarism Itzy "TEEN CRUSH" just because they kinda look like same concept bcs Weki Meki did invented "Teen Crush" concept since first, and this one "COOL" is not their usual concept which they changed it to new one concept, they don't follow trend bcs Weki Meki will make their own name with their own concept and they don't do same concept like other gg. Fantagio did well this era, keep on treating my babies well

Weki Meki For Straight Men !!!
Stan Weki Meki, Have a clean skin
Ki-lings in one week is our best opportunity to get the first win, we need to work hard for it so here are some things that y'all should know:  *-The show: Sound source (40%), album (10%), video (20%), broadcast (15%), StarPlay pre vote (5%).* We are against pentagon, their sales are so much higher than us but their views and charts are low, if we won the live vote and pre vote, we will get the win.  *What we can do to win?*  - Stream the mv, ever if we are so much higher stream the mv anyway. -BUY THE ALBUM, please buy the album we just sold 1,338 copies today. - And the most important, COLLECT VOTES ON STARPLAY. DON'T KNOW HOW TO VOTE? HERE'S A TUTORIAL: https://twitter.com/WEMEVotingTeam/status/1274503126448513025?s=19 - GO TO OTHER IDOLS MVS AND ASK POLITELY IF THEY CAN HELP US STREAMING (try with loona, astro and fromis_9).
Weki meki always bring something new
Please, don't slow down... We too slow.......

Keep stream guys
weki meki be killing a lot of people in this comeback !! believe this is the most successful weme’s comeback and im glad they finally got the recognition they deserve !! first win coming !!
So combined views we are at around 9.9 million so just a little more to 10 million! If the v13ws are freezing here then go s7r34m on The 1thek channel and genie as well to make up for it! But don’t stop s7r34ming here too! FIGHTING! We want this first win right? Also for starplay you can collect v073s not only by watching ads (since i know starplay is being weird with ads) but also do MISSIONS and quizzes in missions give you a lot (there are channels here on YouTube that give answers to the quizzes like BeatEverything so just search up the name of the quiz and a answers vid should pop up!) ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO CHECK THAT U ARE ON RIGHT QUESTION! Not only quizzes but also visiting sites ect... collect a lot pls and give this comeback your EVERYTHING! Make a lot of starplay acc for live v071ng since you can only vote with 3 tickets so make a lot of accs pls! FIGHTING! Also s7r34m the stages for BROADCAST points!!
9,642,947 YouTube isn't counting 😔
The vi2ws are slow because yt is freezing is not because ki-lings stop streaming but is yt, they always make this when a group is getting good number of vi2ws. But we will reach in 10M vi2ws soon at least Friday we reach in 10M and not forget collect votes in Starplay we need the win now

Ahhh la amo <3
전에 있던 곡들은 뮤비가 아쉽다는 느낌이 강하게 들었는데 이번곡은 뮤비도 곡도 코디도 너무 좋다

One thing that got Weki Meki not known is just because they are a lot of groups nowadays. There could be more new fans to the group but they can’t take no more and during the first two years, the main tracks were good but didn’t do much significance in differeciating themselves from other groups. So, when they gave Lu the boy-ish sexy haircut, bringing back the sexy-massive forehead of Sei, and giving Elly much lines (and surprisingly, she can sing well), it didn’t provide any benefit. It’s sad since the line up is perfect and they’re in sync even during relay dance.

Weki Meki nunca desepciona
IF YOU DON'T KNOW GAIN VOTES FOR HELP WEKI MEKI :so first you install the Starplay app, after you install open the app and you will see the Google or Facebook signal and click on whatever you want and then your Google or Facebook accounts will appear, after choosing which account you will use, one will appear page with something to write and with a few squares, first in the writing is the username you choose what you want and then click on the small boxes which means that you are agreeing with the conditions and such and then you already have the account open. Then you will see 3 things at the bottom of the screen and click on the third, then 3 new things will appear on top and you will click on the third and then 4 colored squares will appear and you will click on the light blue which is what allows you watch the ads to win the votes, when you do it for the first time they give 10 votes and will say like "there are no more ads" but like there it will say that you have 100 tickets that correspond to 10 votes and to transform the tickets into loaded votes in the light orange square and you’ll see a 100 and a - + and you’ll click on the + until you don’t have to change the value and then click on the rectangle below the - + and you’re done. You have to do this to see the ads every hour to earn a lot, you are allowed 6 ads every hour and then do what I told you after seeing the 6 ads will say 60 tickets and then click on the orange square and the + e then in that rectangle below the + -. And then to put that in English, you go to the top three lines and a column will appear and you click on a thing with a kind of globe and then click on English. Make this of the votes many times as I do, I already go in 550 votes Weki Meki deserves the 1st win
Let's go 10M!!!
Fighting for 10M!

I'm going sleep now, I have a tired day but I stream Cool a lot of times and I continue collect votes in Starplay and I want wake up and see 10M vi2ws OK???. Bye bye sweeties Ki-Lings
I love the song
This is SUPER fun!! I love how nonchalant the rapping and chorus are; such a cool vibe! It has that swagger which was always kinda present on their previous songs but they really honed in on it here. I like that it also has a bit of western pop and some slight new wave influences, as well. The bridge could've been a bit more interesting/used some lyrics, but other than that, they killed this! Love their looks and outfits, too!!
I kind of always liked their songs, never considered myself an actual fan tho UNTIL NOW can someone please introduce me to them, I wanna join the fandom  🥺👉👈
존나 멋있다
10M.
Guys if you can buy at least 1 album they are doing bad in sales this 1st day was they worst 1st days in sales in all career. I bought 3 albums I want buy more but I'm saving money for other things so I can't and for that I am collecting votes in Starplay and if you don't have money for buy the album please collect votes in Starplay and ask for help in the MVS of other groups.
Red Velvet's Yeri promoting them in her IG makes me happy.  Real women support each other :)

Esta canción es como para una pasarela o un cierto tipo de fiesta, es muy Cool!!
When Weki Meki drop Oppsy I thought is impossible they comeback with a better music because Oppsy is already a bop and is the 3rd best music this year and if I have to do a top 5 of my fav musics this year the top 5 will be 1-Lalalilala of April 2-Butterfly of WJSN 3-Oppsy of Weki Meki 4-Lovesick Girls of Blackpink 5-Cool of Weki Meki(new) And maybe Cool will surpass Lovesick Girls
Weki Meki channel surpass 100M vi2ws. Congrats Queens
Once help in streaming !
10 Million soon!  THAT'S RIGHT!  ;-)

Fighting ki-ling everything for weme
10 million in 5 days???!?!?! Weki Meki WORLD DOMIDOMINATION Road to first win....Here we go!!!!
노래 퍼포먼스 의상까지 전부 체고ㅜㅠㅠ 비정상적인 노출에 몸상할거 같은 힐 아니고 이렇게 입고 무대하는게 더 자유로워보이고 노래에 몰입도 잘 돼서 조아여ㅜㅠ
Can we make them get their first win with this??🥺🥺🥺
They are so talented! Beautiful voices, great dancers,  charismatic and beautiful!! The song is awesome!!! Much love to Weki Meki., from AROHA.
Ki-lings i want to ask.. will we have mass download for Cool on Kmusic site? Because mass dw is help for raise our digitalll!!
Everyone make a lot of starplay accounts! V071ng is CRUCIALLY important if we want to win!
9m????????🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
9 MILLION! 9.1 here we come!!
9M!!!
Now COOL is weki meki's 4th most viewed mv, I'm not crying you are 😭😭😭
Yes yesss keep str34m1ng!! Figjting for WeMe!
9M :))
9M reached!!!!! So happy for Weki Meki!!!!!
9M
노래너무좋아ㅠㅠ
I really love this songgggg
*W × M = Weki Meki!*
Coooooooool☺️
9M vi3ws
9M🔓🎉
9 million naaaaaa aahhhhhhhh
이번 곡 노래도 가사도 의상도 춤도 다 너무 좋다 위키미키 흥하자 ❤️❤️❤️
Congrats on 9M Road to 10M------>🥳🥳
9M 😭♡♡
YES WE HIT 9M
Guys we have big chances to get the win, Pentagon drop the comeback and they will lead in sales but sales only represent 20% of the all result, Weki Meki will lead in vi2ws who represent 2000 points of the final result and if all ki-lings vote we get more 1500 points(1000 of live voting and 500 of Pré voting) that is 3500 points in the final score and maybe we get like 1500/2000 points in digitals so the result is like 5000/5500 in the final score. Pentagon will have like 4000/4500 points and Golden Child will get like 3000/3500.Of course I'm not sure about the results this is just a estimative but the results will be like this
9M! 🔥🙌
9M views in 4days!! Omg ki-ling! I'm so happy jinjaaa!! Let's keep streaming! Let's make it 14M shall we?
HAPPY 9 MILLION!!!!

이전부터 위키미키라는 그룹을 알고 있었는데 추천글 보고 오늘 노래 첨 들어보는 것 같다. 의상 보기 좋다. 퀸덤으로 인해 많이 바꼈다고 하던데 아직도 여돌들 의상 아슬아슬할때가 종종 있더라ㅠㅠ 여돌들 겨울에도 짧은 바지나 치마 입고 그런데 제발 바꼈으면🙏 그리고 난 남돌 노출도 반대함
Wow

8.3M
this is the most viewed MV of theirs? theyre gaining momentum and interest...progress is still progress!! fighting ki lings!~
노래 중독성 짱이야.. 3:12~3:18 수연이 표정 너무 행복해보여서 내가 다 울컥함 ㅜㅜ
Guys can i ask you a favor ?  Lets  stream other mv's of WeMe also and Moobin and Sanha Bad Idea if its fine with you guys.   If you didn't know Aroha's helping us too to stream COOL as exchange i think streaming their video will be fine .  Streaming other mv's after this so their views going to grow. Maybe many of you doesn't  like their mv's that's  why you didn't continue streaming them thats why im not forcing you.  Its on your own decision.   I hope You'll  understand my point even though im bad at english and fighting guys this is for our QUEENS FIGHTING!
9M!!!
Let's stream hard so as to have a chance to win on The Show NEXT WEEK, this week we should not vote, save them for the next week!

Everything in this MV is cool. I also love every part of the song ^_^ but my favorite part is Lucy's RECIPE :-P

Omggggg~~~~8M♡♡♡♡♡
피키피키 이후로 간만에 대작이 나온 느낌입니다ㅠ 진짜 윜밐 군무 맛집인거야 뭐 보증된거고 컨셉이며 의상이며 노래며 위키미키에 찰떡이고 요새 트렌드에도 딱이네요...... 너무너무 좋아요 흑흑 루시 도연 페어 쌉간지 페어안무 바로 다음에 유정이 치고 나오는 것도 최고고 루아 숏컷 진짜 대존멋,,, 머리가 짧으니까 안무 몸 쓰는 것도 동작 하나하나 잘 보이고 멋집니다ㅜㅜ 코로나 시즌이라 못 보러 가는게 아쉬울 정도에요 키차이가 꽤 많이 나는 멤버들이 섞여있는데 대형에서 오히려 그게 시너지가 나는 것도 대박이에요.....
8M✅ 9M✅ 10M✅ 11M✅

Pls str3am harder b4 ads end. Ads gave 6m vi3ws for mv last week. This week will be hard to win bcos they came back later than other groups. The company should only start the ad this week, so that weki meki got a high chance to win on the show...
Trop bien et bravo pour les 7.9m de vue
Go go go 👆
Today i made the brilliant decision of watching Weki Meki MVs for the first time. I got curious because of Oopsy, I was endeared with Picky Picky, and now I'm absolutely STANNING because of Cool 💞💞💞💞💞💞
Go Go Go 8m Ki-Lings
Good job girls,i hope more people notice weki meki,they song and talent deserve. I recomended you my first playlist weki meki song: I don't like Your girlfriend Stay with me Fantastic La la la Lucky Iron boy  Metronome True Valentine Picky picky Dazzle Dazzle And now Cool

Wow they are so fast, i salute ki-lings for being hard working in terms of streaming, i like weme songs it's a bop i wish Fantagio boy/girl group will recieve so much appreciation  AROHA here :)
"How do you like this video and this song?" Me: "Cool"
Tell me your fav b-side from this mini album?  Mine: Sweet Dreams.
YALL WE HAVE TO VOTE ON THE SHOW TO WIN
SUYEON ELLY YOOJUNG DOYEON SEI LUA RINA LUCY!!!!!
Queens served so much I cant
This feels so fresh for many reasons but one thing that is standing out to me is the maximum effort given to the choreography by all members. Suyeon has in particular made noticeable improvement in her dancing capabilities.
Realmente estaba un poco triste que la calidad de los videos y ediciones de Weme estaban bajando...  Estaba como que porfa Fanmu cambia de editor...  De hecho xD los diseños de Ki-ling eran mejores!!!  Y aunque en este cb también fue algo así (los post)... el mv es la excepción, es HERMOSO y de CALIDAD. Contrasta con los últimos mvs. Claro, muy aparte de la música: para mi siempre a sido buena ♡.
here i am again in the middle of my online school
Keep on screaming the views is so slow nowwwww
don't stop streaming!! our girls deserve the world.
#Wekimekifirstwin

Um, who is the fierce queen with the short hair? I'm in LOVE.
guys do not forget to accumulate the points in the starplay (The Show) for weki meki, the points of physical sales will only start counting on the 13th (massive vote on the 17th) until then save your points in the starplay (the show) and watch all the stages and vote on other music shows if possible too! (PT-BR) galera não se esqueçam de acumular os pontos no starplay (The Show) pro weme, os pontos de vendas físicas só vão começar a contar no dia 13 (votem no final da semana acumulativo dia 17) até então salvem seus pontos no starplay (the show) e assista todas os stages e se possível vote para o weki meki em outros music shows!

Doyeon is the korean Zendaya
Ki-lings, I know it can get boring and tiring when str€am1ng, but Weki Meki has worked so hard to bring us perfect stages, we must let them know we have seen their effort and support them
¡Es fascinante ver este video musical y lo bien realizado que esta,me encantó, impecable trabajo y chicas sigan adelante con ese talento y gracias por permitirme disfrutar de sus vídeos que están buenísimos!!!😍👍😊👍👍
THEY'RE SO UNDERRATED I CANT

뮤비 돌리자 키링들아~ 애들이 좋아하는거 보고싶어
i keep coming back to this song again and again its so good!!
KEREN BGT WOI
Anyway this is A SONG. Weki Meki Slayyyy❤️🖤🧡🤎💛💜💚💙
i wish i loved this song but it just doesn’t feel like weki meki vibes ,, like their last songs had a weki meki charm and cool just doesn’t have that :(
My favorite lines: Yoojung take it easy Suyeon every every day I just wanna dance Lucy rap
When I wake up tomorrow I'll be expecting at least 8 m views which is insane when we think about other weme mvs
7.7 million! WE CAN DO IT KI - LING!!!
KiLings: the most views WeMe has for an MV is 12M to date (correct me if I’m wrong). You think we can double what we have done so far and get to 14M? Maybe in a week or 2?? We need to show Fantagio that Weki Meki deserves the world (lightsticks, concerts, etc)! We can do it KiLing!!!!
Keep on streaming the views is so slow now
100M en 1 mes? Vamos Kilings !! ♡
V13ws are getting slowly .. pls keep str34m

Everyone, this time back is very good to win the first trophy, let's accumulate votes on the starplay app for weki meki. Fighting.
Its unique
유아루가 팔로우한다고?
⚠️⚠️ We are gonna to be on the show let’s week, so i will put the show criteria below, we have to do our best to get that win! the competition will be truly big, but we have to do this!  The tracking week starts Saturday, not sure about the time but it's Saturday on Korea SO WE MIGHT BE IN THE TRACKING PERIOD FOR NEXT WEEK ALREADY We have a two day headstart against other opponents in digital and youtube but our physical will only be out on Monday (tomorrow) 🔴 Digital (40%) - It's our biggest weakness but the most important criteria, so things won't be easier - Downloads > streams acc to @KshowAnalysis on twitter  - If you can afford, search for Genie/ Melon passes, every dl/stream will count (if u buy through a 3rd party, check if it's reliable) 🔴 YouTube (20%) - Our 24hrs views were great but they won't count for next week's tracking so please KEEP streaming for this entire week like it's our first day - @WEME_SUPPORT and @chartswekimeki on twitter have streaming tutorials - we should host streaming parties, I'm down if you guys too 🔴 Physical (10%) - We will be up against groups with better physical sales, but our album releases on the 12 so at least we won't have zero points - PLEASE if you can pre-order the album, it will help a lot. A link with discount: twitter.com/Ktown4u_com/st… 🔴 Pre-voting (5%) - It's the smallest criteria but if we win it will help to decrease the difference in other criteria we might lose - Starplay is TERRIBLE and several users are going through glitches but every ticket counts as well 🔴 Live voting (10%) - Ok this one is important as it can reduce our weakness at physicals - We're going against big fandoms so create as many Starplay accounts as you can and get 3 votes ready for each (it won't be easy due to the glitches so prepare it starting NOW) - I remember we got like 600 points in live voting on OOPSY era, not sure how it was before but this is a good amount, we just need to go even bigger and get that 1000. 🔴 Broadcast (15%) - Supposedly how many times a song plays on SBS MTV but The Show pulls these numbers out of nowhere and there's no way of knowing it upperhand ⚠️⚠️There's at least 3 more competitors coming next week that go to The Show so we need to maximize our efforts, our chances of winning aren't that high, I know, but if we give up without a fight then what's the point (cr: lucy4moon on twitter)
Go weme look the views this group will famous at future
DONT SLOW DOWN! So close to 7.8 mil!
Arte
I literally can't stop listening to this
SLAY IT GORLLL
600k to pass i don't like your girlfriend dance practice!!
KEEP STRMING KI-LINGS THIS IS THE BEST WE'VE EVER DONE
Lucy was really the killing part
몰랐는데 위키미키도 냉미녀 그룹이였구나 넘 멋지게 찰떡으로 컨셉 잘나온거같아요 이번 노래❤
i know almost nothing about them and have never been a huge fan of their music, but this song went straight to my playlist unexpectedly. I dont listen to many ggs, but ggs are killing it this year ngl
I think one of the girls was in Astro's music video Breathless. She seems similar.
PLS VOTE FOR WEKI MEKI IN STARPLAY THEY CAN *WIN* NEXT WEEK PLEASE 🛐🛐
Lua looks incredible omg help
they are so talented and this song is so much fun i love it
Imagine if Cool beat Crush's views in a week that would be legendary!
Can we get to 9 mil in 8 hours?
KI-LINGS LET'S GET CRAZY FOR WEKI MEKI 🧡
Can we reach 20M in 2nd week? Like... it’s not impossible if we work hard.. i know some of u will stop strrming when this hits 10M pls don’t have that mindset, lef’s do better for them
kilings y'all doing great keep going arohas are here to support weme :))
I'm in love with this song and with this group! I will definitely support them! Finally a group with wonderful music, dancing and clothes without sexualizing! I'm tired of always seeing more of the same in relation to girl groups! People say they are tired of the same things over and over but do not support when a group are talented and different like that.
Gay for Doyoung and Youjung

I am so proud of us for how much support we are showing through streams. Those of us who have the expendable cash should definitely pick up an album. (Or both versions >.>)

انا بحب الفرق اللى بتجتهد لحتى توصل لمستىوى افضل و على سبيل المثال فرقة ويكى ويكى كانت فى الاول ما تعجبنى اغانيها لكن ذى مرة عجبتنى اتمنى من الفرقة تفضل تطور من اسلوبها
I'm here to support yoojung
Aku disini juga untuk mendukung weme terutama my bias choi yoojung love you babe semangat yah.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW GAIN VOTES FOR HELP WEKI MEKI :so first you install the Starplay app, after you install open the app and you will see the Google or Facebook signal and click on whatever you want and then your Google or Facebook accounts will appear, after choosing which account you will use, one will appear page with something to write and with a few squares, first in the writing is the username you choose what you want and then click on the small boxes which means that you are agreeing with the conditions and such and then you already have the account open. Then you will see 3 things at the bottom of the screen and click on the third, then 3 new things will appear on top and you will click on the third and then 4 colored squares will appear and you will click on the light blue which is what allows you watch the ads to win the votes, when you do it for the first time they give 10 votes and will say like "there are no more ads" but like there it will say that you have 100 tickets that correspond to 10 votes and to transform the tickets into loaded votes in the light orange square and you’ll see a 100 and a - + and you’ll click on the + until you don’t have to change the value and then click on the rectangle below the - + and you’re done. You have to do this to see the ads every hour to earn a lot, you are allowed 6 ads every hour and then do what I told you after seeing the 6 ads will say 60 tickets and then click on the orange square and the + e then in that rectangle below the + -. And then to put that in English, you go to the top three lines and a column will appear and you click on a thing with a kind of globe and then click on English. Make this of the votes many times as I do, I already go in 500 votes Weki Meki deserves the 1st win
No solo hagan str34m aquí, reproduzan en navertv y en mubeat, tambien a sus stages en show musicales, eso, descarguen la app de 'the show', vamos ki-lings. Y si pueden intenten promocionarlas en grupos de kpop en faceb00k o en twitter.
The more I watch this, the more I'm falling for Elly

THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING MAJOR
No sigo a las chicas pero siempre las apoyo, ellas ya han dicho algo al respecto de las v1stas que estan subiendo rapido?
7.4M!!! I'm so proud :')
Recuerden no saltarse los anuncios, y tienen que ver el video sin pausarlo, adelantarlo o atrasarlo.
7.4! 7.5 here we come!!
This left me speechless.  It's a wildly different concept for K-Pop. Nothing I ever expected from weki meki.  Grats on leaving the mundane behind.
This is the first time since their debut that I'm listening to them. This song is so cool! So fresh and energetic, such a good decision from Fantagio these girls are so talented and deserve more recognition.
Elly lucu bgt
The song is lack of rhythm
I'm really grateful that I found OOPSY and lead me to this masterpiece I think I'm a fan now. So what's the name of the girl with short hair with some green strands?
DOYEON LITERALLY HAS ME SPEECHLESS HOW CAN SOMEONE BE SO STUNNING
Keren yah iyalah cool gitu loh
Don't be lazy Ki-Ling Let's get crazy!!!
OMG THE BEST COMEBACK 2020😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✨
COLLECT STARPLAY TICKETS FOR NEXT WEEK! PHYSICAL SALES WONT BE COUNTED UNTIL THEN, SO SAVE MOST OF YOUR TICKETS TILL THEN.
Guys stream this song in spotify too if you have the listeners are kinda low,let's work hard for our girls ❤
we are slowing down and we can't. if we don't keep reproducing we won't be able to give the girls the win that they deserve
me encanta este comeback
so what's the fandom's name so i can proudly name myself one? 😌
Wow this song is a bop, the views went up pretty fast, outnumbering oopsy and dazzle dazzle
Yoojung rap has never disappointed me!! Everyone is stunning! OMG
😍😍😍😍😍
WOWWWW 7,3 M!!
Yaass
Guys dont stop streaming.... For first win.. They worked really hard
Go weki meki
In 3 days Cool surpass Dazzle Dazzle Oppsy and Tiki Taka and will surpass La La La in 1 day and maybe will surpass Picky Picky in 2 days so we will definitely surpass the vi2ws of all their MVS in a week. I'M SO PROUD OF THIS FANDOM
7.3! 7.4 here we come!!
7.3M!!
My dream is going slepp and wake up with 9/10M vi2ws and this is not so impossible because yesterday I go sleep the MV was 5.1 and I wake up the MV have 7M vi2ws so if we all fight we can do that and guys continue collecting votes in Starplay for the 1st win next week
와 누가 영어자막 달아줘서 외국인 유입이 늘었나봐 어제까지만해도 조회수 100만대였던 거 같은데,,!!  멋지다 언니들 정말 컨셉 너무 좋아요!  노래도 너무 좋고 춤도 너무 파워풀해서 저까지 시원해지는 기분이에요!

ONLY VISUALS
Family AROHA HERE 💜
Elly Love You
I think I am new Lucy stan. I've never had a Weki Meki bias but I think I found it now!
yes this is the fifth time i’m here
OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD  I AM ADDICTED
i’m so proud of the girls and i’m so proud to be stanning this group before they blow up, i know for sure that they will!! we just have to do our part :))
i'm so thankfuk that fantiago is good handeling their artist!  best company!
i read some comments and i think there are people who need to hear this...so what I want to say is:  Please like all 8 members of the group! Every single one of them has personality and talent and deserves our support...it’s okay that you have a bias but it’s NOT okay to share which member you dislike or that you dislike a member. Imagine how this person would feel! As a fan of the group you have to like all members equally, otherwise it would be better if you leave Killing. So please mind what you comment and share on other platforms!!!  P.S. LET’S MAKE THE BEST OUT OF THIS SUPER COOL MV!!!
COMO QUE LUCY ES LA MAKNAE OMG T AMO LUCY
if this not viral in tiktok, tiktok is useless.
Sei more lines please and more visibility in the MV
7.3 here we come!
If the views keep increasing  We can get  10m by a week  .. keep the rythm  20m by 2 weeks  .. keep the rythm 30m by 3 weeks  ... Keeeeeeeeeeep the rythm  40m by a month     This will be the greatest achievement for WEME and ki-lings  Don't tell me it's impossible
I just wanna cry 😭 They deserve everything, Why do this industry stans by Labels, They should Stan talents not labels. (Just me being honest)

This is my 10th time listening for this song.
is it weird if i say this remind me of After School ‘Shh’ and ‘Heaven’ bland together?   I love it though 😍
sólo soy ki ling desde dazzle dazzle pero durante este poco tiempo que soy fan del grupo me pregunto cómo estas chicas me pueden hacer sentir tan cómoda y feliz, en serio me inspiran mucho y con sólo verlas me causa mucha felicidad así que espero que ellas tengan todo el éxito y felicidad del mundo, a la vez de que más gente las conozca porque estoy segura de que también pueden inspirar a muchas personas tal como hicieron conmigo  PD: perdón por la redacción
Haven’t really been into their other songs but this song is phenomenal. More of this and I will certainly Stan

Weki Meki COOL1STWIN PLEASE
Wow Lua wooooowwww
First win fir wekimeki guys!!!
Lets go to 7M!!!
6.5M
obsessed with suyeons line at 0:40
For me the groups who save this year are:Weki Meki, April, Blackpink and Irene&Seulgi
We don't care about the dislikes haters because that mean Weki Meki fame is growing so is a good thing
이번에 진짜 1위해야 하는데 더쇼 사전투표 순위가 너무 낮아요 내일 오후 2시까지니까 지금이라도 스타플레이 앱 깔아서 투표권 모아서 투표해주세요ㅠㅠ  플레이스토어 쓰시는 분들은 스타플레이 트위터에 다운받는 링크 있어요 그걸로 다운받아주세요! + 그리고 이번주는 음반이 안나와서 음반점수 못받는걸로 알아서 음원이랑 뮤비 스밍, 사전투표가 특히나 더 중요해요 셋다 빡세게 해주세요ㅠㅠ
Futuristic, exquisite, expensive. Right up my lane.
for new fans who wanna know more about the girls and get updates, here are their accounts  instagram: suyeon: @suye.on2di elly: @_haerimida choi yoojung: @dbeoddl_ (tiktok: @wm_choiyoojung) kim doyeon: @lafilledhiver_ sei: @seiric_o lua: @soo_kyungyi rina: @clarosilverina lucy: @ee.hyojeong  weki meki accounts: twitter: @wekimeki and @wekimeki_staff @wekimeki_jpn (japan) instagram: @weki_meki tiktok: wm_official
Hope so weki meki will be appear on knowing brothers or running man but i'm just a potato who always wishing 😌

1. 02:19 마네킹 구도로 춤추는 장면 :  00:28 마네킹처럼 수동적인 전시품처럼 여겨져왔다가 창도 부수고 능동적인 여성이 됨  2. 02:54 크리스마스 케이크를 뒤엎는 장면 : 여자나이는 크리스마스다 25를 넘으면 꺾인다 이 말도 안되는 소리를 집어 던지는거 *뮤비리액션에서 애들이 말한거 보면 첫장면 만찬 테이블은 잘 정리되어있는데 케이크를 엎은 뒤로 엉망이 된다고 함 왜 케이크를 엎었냐는 질문에 틀이 짜증나서 그랬다고 함   저는 이렇게 느꼈는데 이게 맞을까요? 이런 뮤비가 1억뷰가 나와야한다고 생각합니다
6M?! GREAT JOB KI-LINGS!! Let's continue to str34m for Weki Meki!!

The fastest weki meki mv to reach 5+MILLION views ! COOL SOTY SORRY OOPSY HONEY
위키미키 이번 컨셉 너무 좋다 의상도 바지를 입으니까 멤버들의 시원한 칼군무도 제대로 볼 수 있고 너무 좋은 것 같아 노래도 너무 중독성있고 위키미키 화이팅💕💕

Vamos podemos lograr 6m
Im an aroha supporting Fantagio Family. This really amazed me. 5.2m in 2days. Bad idea has 4.4m in 3weeks.  Weki meki is really COOL! 🤩 Hoping that this song will have its 1st win. 👏
Fantagio, where's the lightstick? We need a lightstick!!
Unpopular opinion:This is their best song so far and it is cool that they tried a different concept which suits them the most.
6M!!!
5.2M VIEWS IN JUST 2 DAYS THIS SONG IS JUST A BOP
One of the best tracks from weki meki
500万超えたやん！このまま1000万行けー！
Woaaahh this is new, 5 million views in 2 days. 😍
I heard of Weki Meki from the reality show UHSN when a Kpop composer teaches the young foreign ladies Korean conversational skills.  He tells them "I'm famous composer" & they first are unsure about him but when he starts naming off the groups he composed songs for they become impressed & one the groups was Weki Meki.  I have to say I really like this song & mv.
Stream stream stream, congrats for 5M views weme and ki-lings🥺✊♥️
Just like what their song is called..this is a cool era!

Cool was one of the fairest line distribution this year all of them get the same time of lines and all of them appear a lot in the MV. Funky Fantagio understand this is a 8 member group
Can we get to 6 mil in 9 hrs? YES WE CAN FIGHTING
song of the year here
Why nobody is talking about Doyeon in 1:51 Look all this visual she is like a goddess Ariana was right when she sing God is a Woman that God is Doyeon
The best parts of this song is the chorus and the rap of Lucy, she just kill everyone

...maybe i am lesbian
Weki meki first win, i can feel it
Imo in some parts the singing seems to belong to another instrumental(? Like the instrumental it's so dark to fit the optimistic tone.. and that happened too in their debut song.. I like the song and I love them but I always find that weird in their style..
who is the girl in the center at 1:50 ?
Wish more people would appreciate how good Weki Meki is
Songs I personally think are soty: Psycho Kick it Cool God's menu Wannabe Oopsy So what Boca Dazzle dazzle
Keep 5tr34am1ng!! WEKI MEKI FIGHTING!!!
While you're here don't forget to str34m oopsy! We're not even at 5m there yet :(
They went from *I don't like your girlfriend* to THIS. YES🌈✨
Doyeons proportions are OUT OF THIS WORLD like gurl
Vamos por 5m
Am I the only one who thinks  This would be a summer song? Wekimeki deserves more!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
4.9M!!!
wow just wow i loved it!!
LENDÁRIAS
I'm so happy Weki Meki is get the recognition they deserve was later but is better late than never
6M vi2ws in 3 days we can do it everyone
It really does anger me that the company has them comeback when BlackPink did, but it seems to be going fairly well for WM. We've gotten more views in two days for this than we did for Oopsy, and that's improvement.
Can you guys tell who's on each side at 2:30? I can see doyeon, lua, soojung, and rina but I can't figure out the others
this is weki wicked....💕💖😊
Scream (Dreamcatcher) and Cool is the best songs of this year, I realy really love it
Please st€4m the MV on the official channel & 1theK channel simultaneously. Do str$4m the fancams too. Also, please str€4m other MVs too like Oopsy, Crush, I Don't Like Your Girlfriend.  Keep on str€4ming. Don't stop, we can get the 1st win for them this time. Take care & Fighting!!!
ayo who’s the cute girl with short hair and green front strands
Love you girls♡♡♡♡♡♡
계속 이렇게 멋있는 컨셉하다가 퀸덤2 하면 꼭 내보내셔야 해요.... 위키미키 실력 출중하니까 믿고 꼭 출연 시키기........
🔥👍👍🔊🔊🎧🎧🎶🎶🎶🎶😍😍😍😍
This is so catchy woow~~  I can say 1 thing, weki meki is weki meki and not another group, not the next blackpink or twice, just the first weki meki! Idk the fandom name, but i can tell weki meki is gonna be big 1 day! Its that i'm to lazy to stan (i onky stan skz) otherwise i should have stanned because THIS DESERVES A WIN THIS IS SO GOOD WOW~~
4.8 million views in two days this is a real succes for weki meki 🥺💜
10.10  Let's go for the 5M!!
Wait these girls 😍 I might stan
*POWER* = Weki Meki
I just want my girls to get their deserved recognition T^T
The composition, the vocals, the lyrics, the styling, the cinematography... everything is on point. I didn’t expect to be this blown away. I really want them to get more attention.
The NEXT Girls’Generation - 🤎WEKI MEKI🤎
4.8M!!!
yasss girlsssss keren banget sih lagu sama lirik nya
♥♥♥
Fantagio fam is always lit.... Agree with me🔥🔥🔥
Hope they can get the 1st win. Fighting ki-ling!
I hate it when people say that this sounds like a "boy group song"...  NO. it's a gender neutral song that you can see a boy group perform it, and there's not a lot of groups who do this style. Because in kpop, companies think that "distinctions" between ggs and bgs should always be there. That's why in ggs cute or girl crush concepts are prominent, and in boygroup the most popular are the '상남자' (idk the english for this hehe) concepts. A few of the groups who do this style is Kard (bc they're co-ed), Dreamcatcher, and Astro (Their brother group).  Weki Meki is really creating a concept for themselves and it works well because it describes them so well. The message of this song fits them and they're so COOL.
2:17 Why they changed that dance thoo , its so elegant and iconic .
This song is defo growing on me
stan weki meki
Suyeon is so cooool
I LOVE SEI SO MUCH YALL DONT KNOW
I'm gay for Weki Meki (especially Yoojung)
This is a HIT
I'm new i only know Doyeon and I can recognize the main vocalist but idk her name. Who is the girl with the really short hair??? That styling was such a good choice on her omg she really caught my attention. Plz help weki meki fans 🙏 also what should I call u guys? 😅
they surpassed oopsy's views in two days. oopsy was released 3 months ago. although i prefer oopsy to cool... tHE POWER THIS COMEBACK HOLDS.
진짜...겁내 멋있다...아니...잘생기고...귀엽고...자신감있고...다들 표정이랑 눈빛이 넘 좋다...
UHHHHH, WEKI MEKI, MIS NIÑAS SON LAS MEJORES YEEEIII
Sounds like a boy group song
this song is so different yet its so so good??? like this will be on loop for weeks
Ki-ling keep fighting
I'm sure we can get 5M now!!!
This is cool!!!😎😎😎 everything about this song is cool oh even the name of the song is cool lol my best wishes for weki meki!!! Blink supporting here!

내 평생 이런 걸그룹을 기다려왔다우
I've been listening to their music on Spotify for like 2 years now, this is the first time I've watched one of their mvs, I'm trying my best to resist the urge to hard stan,,,,
this gives me 2ne1 vibes, but idk why!
i have a crush on Doyeon
OMG WEME YESSS QUEENS
Omg this is so good
I liked the  dance.
I stanned f(x) back in the day and this managde to pump some fresh blood into those same old veins of mine. excellent song, video, lyrics, dance, looks, attitude, and concept choice overall. I don't know the first thing about this group but this makes me hope their other songs are just as fantastic. great job!
5.5M IN 2 DAYSSS OPRAH
Kilings Fighting!!!
I’m not fan of them anyway, but this song is really marking their territory in Kpop 🔥
im so gay, girls with short hair make me weak 😭 tbf this entire group make me weak
Yo realmente amo la canción pensé que sería algo más lento y romántico pero no wow es increíble astro debería aprender de sus hermanitas
위키미키 사랑해!!!!!!!!!ㅠㅠ
DON'T FORGET TO VOTE FOR WEKI MEKI ON MCOUNTDOWN FOR A WINI!!! LINK: https://www.mwave.me/en/mcountdown/prevoting/vote
SEI I LOVE YOU
Im obsessed from the line “Meoributeo balkkeutkaji” and i think i heard that line and i found out that it is so familiar because of the song “Hot issue” by 4minute.
Kilings Fighting!!! Let's go 5M!!!
FINALLY I CAN SEE AND HEAR YOU MORE MY QUEEN LUCY (´∧ω∧｀*)
Can somebody point out the members names and time lapse for new fans?
Kilings Fighting!!!
On the way to 5M!!
*EVERY EVERY DAY I JUST WANNA DANCE*  But the problem is, dancing and I don't get along
I hope doyeon and yoojung recent acting gigs got them more budget for future comebacks. Song is a whole bop but can’t help but notice how cheaper and plainer their mv sets looks as compared to past releases
Vamos por esos 5M
Let's go 5M!!!
Wow love this!!
♡
This song and MV are seriously so amazing. They deserve multiple wins for this, and along with their other work it should solidify their place as a major player in this generation. They really have a unique sound and all their songs are top quality. STOP SLEEPING ON WEKI MEKI!!
Wow.....wow.....Wow😍😍😍😍😍😍

This concept and song is everything
This type of song gives me Nct's punch vibes it really sounds different. No chorus no bridge no intro idk what's going on in the entire song but I enjoyed it
WE SURPASSED OOPSY WITH 4+MILLION VIEWS IN TWO DAYS!! KEEP FIGHTING
THIS IS SOOOO ADDICTING!!! I hope they'll finally get their first win.

I come from outside the fandom and I say this:  This one is truly a masterpiece!　ファンダム外からきた私が言います。これは傑作！！
The song is great😱😍
Imagine Weki Meki in Queendom, imagine them winning 10 wins with only 1 comeback and imagine them get 10M vi2ws in 24 hours. Come on Fantagio they can be supper big
Vamos por esos 5M, estoy muy orgullosa de Kiling, estas reinas se merecen esto y mucho más. <3
위키미키 이번 컨셉 너무 멋있다! 반드시 흥하자 💗 위키미키 화이팅!

It took me a couples listen but I like it ❤️
I wonder whether this is one of those times when an agency has actually responded to fan feedback. Lua has had a lot of increased promotion this year and featured in lots of Weki Meki things. And we knew all along she was amazing. Now she's truly shining!!
It took 3 months for oopsy to get 4,4 m and it took only 2 days for cool to reach 4,4 m. How the fandom grown so much wow
54k likes to 200k
ALMOST 4.5M OMG
COOL passed oopsy in views and now is Weki Meki's 7th most viewed mv!!!

It's still fairly obvious that Fantagio aren't giving them an actual budget to work with, but this video is leaps and bounds better than OOPSY's video. Great song, hope it does well.

Todas se ven hermosas, y el video está bien producido me encanta
Kilings don't slow down, we're too slow.  Let Weki Meki win first. Let's go 4M!!!!!
worrrrrkkkkk queeeeenssss
Bop..I love this song.
0:30 TAKE IT EASY!
Cool!!!!
Finally 3.1M in 1day..
For some people that clicked this video because of curiosity and you like the song. I suggest yall to listen to their other songs, Picky picky, crush, oopsy, dazzle dazzle.
Weki Meki has been a GROUP this year! I haven't been disappointed with any line distribution lately.
Lua gives me extreme Amber vibes. Her aura is so different.
omg the views r so high for them its a record. so proud.
I don't know why but I think I understand "COOL" better than I can understand "100 FACTS" ^_^U sorry!
checkout the acapella version here: https://youtu.be/6avk1OgWiMY and also the instrumental version here: https://youtu.be/uzkNYyzmdxg
Can't wait for the performance MV version.... They change some parts of the choreo for their live stages and would love to see the original one...  For those who will learn the dance, you really need to warm your legs properly first before learning this... My body is aching so much that I can't walk properly now... Learning the dance is such a nice exercise...   Anyway another bop from Weki Meki... They really deserve that first win...
DOYEON RAPPER
Another song that's going to be on repeat for a while.  It's so good
This is amazing
They all look so pretty in this comeback, but Sei in red is so <3 <3
LUA HAS LINES!!!!!
0:40 and 3:11 Suyeon has found another way to kill me! <3
Here again for this song and this amazing WEKIMEKI♥️
This feels so different from anything done by Weki Meki so far, yet it doesn't feel out of place between their other songs :D
I don't stan these girls but i love their song
Certified Double Platinum!!!!!💎🔥
Still hoping this song can take their first win

Perfeitas
the song is really catchy

Bitch what?! This is one of the best kpop songs ever. PERIODT.

Kerennnnnnm
Weki Meki-Ling Forever! 😍😍😍  I really love this group and nobody can beat them. They we're the best synchronized group for me... ❤💛❤💛❤💛❤💛❤💛   #NEW_RULES #COOL
Ki-ling fighting!
is it just me but each members all have some unique features especially their eyes
I'm here to say that Lua is stunning in this MV, from haircut + outfit to attitude
Is it me or Lua is getting finer and finer?
"I'm only going to be sticking to my 3 girl groups and 1 boy group. I don't plan to stan anyone else"  *sees Weki Meki*: well... actually
I usually try to catch up on weki meki but shit, best song to date wow
윜밐 진짜 대박나자 🥺〰 컨셉도 넘 좋구 언니들 편하게 입고 해서 너무 좋아 노래도 대박이야(☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
Cool. Be hotter. Beyond the Control. Bring it Back ... Woo, I do as I want ... I'm beautiful as I am ...  Hear that? That's Weki Meki saying that they are COOL because they are true to theirselves. So haters who say they copy others, Weki Meki says that "We can change them"  meaning once haters open up to them, they can see that they are a  unique girl group and they are OOPSY to hate them! Ki-Lings let's do our best for our girls so that they will DAZZLE more. Fighting!
Weki Meki is the impostor because they almost kill me but I'm lose already
QUEENS.
Hooooooly!!! This song really Fresh and Unique, so far no one have this concept...u know what i mean it... IT So Coool!!!
Weki Meki first win!!

I can't choose my real bias gosh. I think all of them is my bias right now.
위키미키는 앞으로 이런 보깅풍의 노래 몇곡  잘 내도 쭉갈듯...
happy *3M* <3
I see a lot of moves that were used in Wannabe and other overused moves from other groups. The themes in the video are pretty basic too. I mean; a table full of flowers, a long hallway that everyone walks down, everyone laying down faking like they’re asleep, holding random objects, staring blankly at the camera, that crescent moon shirt, Seriously, all they needed was someone in a bathtub and this video would have hit peak kpop unoriginality. The lyrics are pretty basic too. They’re really about being yourself and being unique. Not too out of the ordinary especially following ITZY.
5 billions come on !!. Fans fanmu familiy please help streaming bad idea too ^^
one of the best songs this year i littlerally love every part of this song. i’m not a stan but i really hope they win. I AM ADDICTED TO THIS SONG LITTERALLY MY FAVORITE PERFECT KPOP SONG, they hit everything that i love in kpop

Happy 3M Views🎉 let's go 10M and First Win🏆🙏
i like it
It's been a long, long time since I watched a girl group mv where I didn't hate the outfits. I need more girl group concepts featuring gender-neutral outfits like the long baggy pants here (that ALL of the members are wearing)  and the all-white jumpsuits!  They don't need to show legs, cleavage, belly buttons, and bare shoulders to look like idols.  I've seen enough of those to last a lifetime.
This was soooo gorgeous!!!
Daeng:')))
Si alguien tiene un enlace para descargar la app de votación que me lo pasé porque no lo encuentro <lloro> creo que sólo podré hacer stream , igual recién empezamos a votar la  próxima semana <triste>
볼수록 느끼는데 영상미가 지리는듯 뮤비 너무 멋있네
the choreo is so satisfying and suits the song so well!
ay ay ay ay

Weki Meki can really pull off any genre 😎
Como siempre weki Meki dándonos tremendos temazos ♡♡

I came here beacoz I saw this on Red Velvet  Yeri's story and I am not regretting, this is truly a bop
🤗 Interesante!
i only know some members from weme so i don’t really stan them but i’m suprised they haven’t got their first win all of their songs are bops like-
I LOVE ITTTT AAAAAAAAAAA
Youtube counts views if you watch 30 seconds of the video...keep streaming! First win here we come!
this mv is amazing omg
It’s different but not bad
Well, how do I say this, I always has this conception that all of the Produce 101 will have difficulties in promoting within a group and I'm half wrong, half right. (50/50)  But for this one. I need to applaud Fatingo for trying off something new. Weki Meki is getting better and better and with the Melbourne Bounce as the main selection for their title song is a daring move. For the music and compose element, this arrangement hit the spot IF the lyrics are in English. But yet Hangul (Korean) language killed off some of the vibe of this song as it didn't ride along with the beat and it's kinda off, especially during the hook part and the climax of this song.  But yet again, It's listenable as it has one of my favourite genre which is Bounce/Melbourne Bounce (don't refer it as ''sounds'')  7/10
please don’t give up on str3aming because we did so well in the first day,,,
LUCY'S RECIPE IS MY REASON FOR STAY ALIVE
Weki meki gets better every comeback I swear
So good ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Woow, I wasn't expecting something like this. The song, the MV are just amazing, they look so gorgeous.  I'm shock 😯

Please everyone share this on social media, encourage people to st/re/am, send it to your friends! Maybe there are other fandoms we could collab with? Comment on recent MVs with something like "ki-lings are here to help, this song is so awesome! In return please watch Weki Meki's Cool, you won't regret it!!"  fighting everybody <3<3<3

2 545 795
Ayo Ki-Ling Indonesia semangat  and Ki-Ling internasional fighting!! StanFanMu
WEKI WAKI= talento
I'll be honest, I had heard about Weki Meki but they didn't really catch my attention, I only knew about Doyeon, but with this song, IT'S A BOOM, IT'S REALLY A BOOM, it makes me want to know who each one is, about all the short-haired girl and the rapper from minute 2:41 (I already chose them as my bias of Weki Meki jsjs ), I'm sure that with time and with each improvement they will probably earn more, Weki Meki FIGHTING !!! <3.
The song is a little bit messy but it’s good
Oh cool. finally this type of song
why is this so good?
This song make me feel so hyped!! I've always loved WM releases but this is so fresh!!! I can't even explain it but this song IT IS
좋은데~??
Never liked any of their songs but this one ! WOOOOW

2.6M pls
I hope weki meki get first win🙏🙏
This song, "Cool" and Loona's "So What" both have this awesome 90s EDM fight song anthem feel. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STYLE! Especially with the Arab/Moroccan influence in the instruments. This works so well for them! If someone did a mix up with this song and So What, itd be 🔥!!!!
Weeey, las visuales. Cada vez son más hermosas;;; Amo la canción, sobre todo por el mensaje;; siempre pensé que Weki meki sería mejor sin la temática de amor adolescente cuz they're such queen's!!
Wait but Elly's line in 0:36 was os on point and unique
Manifesting mkwk first win
this group NEVER disappoints
I'm definitely in love with lua, look at 1:43 that expression, look at that little face, impossible not to fall in love.
When I listen to this song I pretend that I’m a model on a run way 😂
Que isso moço
WHAT This is really Crush's contender;(
Who is the short green hair?
Omg I love it
LUA’s HAIR!  This song is absolute perfection.
This is the best Kpop girl group song of the year to me
this is song that could perfectly fits on fashion show while models are walking on catwalk!!
The weki meki style is cool, they are other level!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love them ❤️
2:40 who is she? :o she is really pretty!!!
YEAHH lets go gurl!!!!! u got this!
Damn Weki Meki have really worked hard this year 👏👏

LUCY AND DOYEON SHIP FOREVER!!!  👌😍😍😍😍 WEKIMEKI FIGHTING!! COOL COMEBACK
This is a very interesting and different concept that no one has done before. It’s a bop
This is COOL!!
💙💙💙 I love weki meki
I love this song uwu
Who's the one with short hair?? I think I'm in love
Not a fan of weki meki but a fan of kpop in general. In my own opinion, the song is good in so many parts but some parts feel a bit cluttered that throws me off. But I think this is a new sound for weki meki and I definitely would like to see where they are going from here.
keep sharing this with everyone you can, more people need to know about this amazing song!!!
My face during the whole song :O
Why The thumbnail looks like axe bodyspray commercial :/
OH MY GOD, *¡SEI!* 🖤 She looks amazing!!!
love love
We aren’t voting on starplay this week bc there are too many other fandoms that will vote for their faves so we have to save the votes for next week!!! pls spread it on twt, insta, ....
Fighting!!!

omg the mv and choreo look so good
Okayyyy........but this song is hittin differently istg
Underrated this group. Weki Meki should be more respected.
위키미키 어떤 컨셉이든 다 잘하는데 이번 컴백처럼 가지고 있던 팡팡 터트리면서 우리 개잘해 무대 씹어먹어 하는 컨셉이 진심 찰떡임듯.. 무대하면서 지치는 게 아니라 탄력받는 게 보여. 이번 컴백이 위키미키에게 짜릿한 경험이 되어서 쭉쭉 위키미키를 위한 무대를 꾸미길 너무 멋있음 진짜
1:51 head empty
4 million today?
Ok after watching and listening to this bop multiple times I now know what this gives me. This gives me SF9 feels when they transitioned to their "Good Guy" era.  WeMe in these sexy suits and white outfits, and this more mature sounds gives me all that! I can't wait to get my album.
Sound like some SM boy group B side music
Que canción tan buena!
ME GUSTO MUCHO LA CANCION
in the words of the mekis: this song is so cool. also interesting to see how the mv is a mix of dazzle x2 and oopsy !!
5M TODAY!!!
비트 다 좋은데 멜로디에 힘좀 주지 아깝다
Hi I'am AROHA
Mdssss tá maravilhosoooooo❤❤
Pay attention to the lyrics. Oh my god. ✊💖
시발 이거라고.. 애들 날아다니네
i can imagine models fashion walking to this
Woah this how so many views it seems like Weki Meki is doing pretty well !!!!!
they're so beautiful i might cry
Always support weki meki and astro Fantagio familyyy
This song is for a fashionable haute couture catwalk
Honestly i was not a fan of their older songs but this one suits them very well and sounds addictive. I love it .
بلاك خلال يوم ونص جابو 100M مشاهده وانتو و بانقتان خلال يوم 100M مشاهده😂😂😂😂😂💔😝😝😝😝😝😝🤧🤧🤧🤓🤓🤓😏😏😏😏
전작까지는 걸그룹의 걸에 방점이 있었다면 이번 작품은 그룹으로 축을 옮긴 느낌이예요. 결은 좀 다르지만 브리트니스피어스가 toxic으로 각성하던 거 보는 느낌. 외국형들 반응도 좋으니 이번에 물들어올 때 확실히 살렸으면 좋겠어요!
الاغنيه اسم على مسمى كوول
i love the amount of attention fantagio is paying to lucy!! this is def suyeon’s era!!
3 million?? Let's do it
i love at the start, that rap part. it’s addicting !!!!

Weki Meki will make it big. Bigger than ever. I'll make sure of it. WEME FIGHTING!!!! they all look so gorgeous in this mv! my bias is sei :)
LETS KEEP GOING
okay okay so i had pretty high expectations for this song because of the amazing teasers. and guess what, they absolutely didn’t dissappoint. this song is amazing. it’s unique, trendy, something new and addicting. the lyrics and the beat are clever, and THE AESTHETICS? HELLO the white outfits and (in some parts) the dance look like something that everyone would expect from boy groups. but they took it, made it their own and nailed it!! when weki meki said ”new rules” they actually meant that❤️😳😳
this song slaps!!! omg weki meki always exceeding expectations every comeback
Lua's hairstyle got me : 💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😍😍😍
I think this is the fastest time that Weki Meki reaches a million views??
뮤비 디게 돈 안썼나부다
IS THIS THEIR MOST VIEWED MV IN JUST 24 HOURS?

Doyeons Body @1:51 😍

I'm bad at explaining but this song (especially 1st verse and chorus) feels like... what to call it? catwalk bop? something you'd like to hear at a fashion show, it sounds so high-fashion?? I DONT KNOW BUT I LIKE IT
Oh my Rua 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

O conceito está diferente dos outros 😍adorei
02:59 - I See Kim Namjoo's "Bird" Outfit

I SERIOUSLY LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THIS MV?? LIKE EVERYTHING IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL
Love this mv
When I think Doyeon can't be more beautiful than she already is she come with all that visual
루아 너무 멋있어ㅠㅠ💚
It's amazing to feel coolness and hotness at the same time! How do you even do this Weki Meki? 🥰  Yoojung and Doyeon were my bias and bias wrecker, but I was in shock when I saw Lua and Lucy. I think this era, Suyeon stole my heart! 😍😘
This is shit
Hoo
That people fall asleep in their beds but for nothing in the world fall asleep in the talent of Weki Meki because they are the most complete GG in the kpop industry. He has everything and only pure talent. I am very proud of them. I have been Ki-Ling for a year and it was the best decision I have ever made. The only thing I regret is not having listened to them before and that their songs are so short because they are art.
WekiMeki never failed to give us great music and great concept🤧🥰💖
did an anti cut yoo-jung's hair? O_o
Let''s go 3M!
Nctzen here checking them out. I am amazed. They should def blow up. This is way too good to stay underrated. I esp love the bridge. It sounds so anthemic and modern. Fighting Weki Meki <3  Edit: omg im so hooked on this song been playing it nonstop and it's 10million already wow
2.2M!
와 루시 너무 찰떡 틴크러시도 넘 좋고 걸크도 너무 잘하네 ;;;;;;  루시 못하는거 뭔데??? + 항상 생각하는건데 코디님 본진도 윜밐이실듯...코디하시면서 덕질하시는듯한느낌 엄철 도전적이고 뻔하지않고 너무 멋있습니다...항상 감사해요 코디님😍

Elly voice is a drug.
I love this!!
So cool
I’m in LOVE with this concept
GORGEOUS QUEENS
How the heck do other fans manage to pick a bias they are all gorgeous!
Their BEAUTY
this kind of song doesn't make you lss the first time you listen to it, but as time passes by, when you repeatedly listen to this song, it actually grows and makes you realise that this song is it! fire! let's get weki meki a first win ki-lings!! I'm not a kiling, just a casual listener who enjoys listening to their discography. Hoping that they're going to get that win next week. fighting!!
Announcement! Ki-lings, ROHAS, etc, don’t vot3 on STARPLAY later, save your vot3s for next week! Weme’s physical sales won’t start until next week, so they won’t be counted this week. Save your votes for next week!!!  PLEASE SPREAD!

Sometimes I am so sad that big groups dance practice have more then little groups MVs. Not that big groups don't deserve it but.....
I've often heard the tone of this song ..
服裝品牌的感覺
Boring 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
The MV look so simple again but the girls be slaying tho
0:08 - 0:17 KIM DOYEOOOON T-T U KILL ME.
who else went wild?
YEEEEEEES
i saw boy groups do a similar concept, but i think this is the first girl group with this flow <3 weki meki is aging like a fine wine, getting better with each comeback!
I like this
I officially stan now. Cool.
They are so damn cool
I'm not even a Weki Meki fans, but this is so Damn Bop
TTARAWA
Weki meki is ivolving this is the first song i like from them
Damn why weki meki is so underatted i feel bad for those who dont stan weki meki
Yass anotha bop from WeMe, thanks to Yeri I wouldnt, know they had a comeback till I saw the insta post. Reveluv here supporting WeMe and Ki-ling.
I really like their songs and these girls are stunning!!!
Jake Peralta would like this song.
This song is a bop.
Yes love this change in concept. It seems very bold and vogue(?), which shows such a cool new side with everyone. (Also my IOI heart wanting to believ this was an intentional collab w Chungha after her previous mv even though I know it’s not related at all)
이쯤되면 억까들이 불쌍해진다 ㅋㅋ 역대급이라서
😍😍😍💕💕👏👏
Their dancing is so in sync omg
그렇죠 이제 이런것도 보여줘야죠
💕💕❤❤❤

their best comeback so far.
Good job guys, we can do it. Let's harder. And don't forget to save your vote for next week.
This is perfection ! I like it
I’ve been watching these gals for a while now and can honestly say this style suits them the BEST by far. Also loving the pairwork in straight lines 🤩 they are spectacular, this comeback is so familiar yet refreshing at the same time.
Even though we already achieve the 2M in 24H let's keep str34am this mv for the sake of their 1st win guys!!! Ki-Ling fighting ❤️
Thanks god ,finally they get pretty good  n unique song. before this just.......no comment
It is so underrated :( they deserve more appreciation
I'm so happy when we reach 2M in 24 hours. Worked hard and don't give up. Keep watching!!!
How many views did we get in 24 hours? Sorry I missed seeing it😭
GUYS DON'T FORGET TO STREAM THE COMEBACK STAGE TOO
Yes this is my weki meki 🇮🇳💜🇰🇷
I like this x
This is so goood pls give them a 1st win💖
keep streaming for mv please
They have so much power & talent, they deserve  mooore
Omg
The girls did great, no question. *BUT* big kudos to the producer of the song. Never heard anything so unique but at the same time so nice. Holy shit.
I think that there are hidden meanings behind the things that they were holding,  Rina's rose, Lua's cake, Suyeon's umbrella the lock. I'll watch it again and I will share my theory about it if I can find something hehe. Also, congrats we've reached 2 M!!! WEKI MEKI AND KI-LINGS KAJAA
oppsy still better song for me.. but will always support weki meki.. ^^
2 mil in one day is the record
야 이거 뜬다 ㄹㅇ 진짜 자주 활동해줘서 대단하다고 생각했는데 짖짜 이번노래 지렸다
Oh My gaHhh !! Instant bop ! They are so Cool ahhhhhhhhhh
one of my favourite comebacks this year!
MV는...   COOL이다
Hey ladies, I'm back watching it again!!!
for me this is Weki Meki's BEST song (at least for now)
The two pre-choruses where they sing softly are just insane. It’s just an amazing song 🎵
this is mix clc and everglow 😂 3 video in 1)))
역대급이다 제일좋아요 여태했던것중에
DOYEON TRYING TO KILL ME?!?!?
i really really hope weme finally gets the recognition they’ve deserved for a long time now
😎🏛😊😎🤓😀❤🌐🌎🏟🏚🏛🤘
PLEASE STREAM COOL AS LONG AS YOU CAN LETS GET THEM THEIR FIRST WIN THEY DESERVE IT SO BAD
Weki Meki大好きです❤️
The only thing i will like more in the future is if they put more dance on Rina'parts. Cause in the latests comebacks she just do poses and hand things on all of her parts. And she's an incredible dancer so they should show that more ♡
We're not voting on starplay this week, save tickets for the next week. Reason: tracking period for the other categories ends soon, so we won't have enough points even if we win prevote. SAVE YOUR STARPLAY VOTES FOR 2ND WEEK KI-LINGS
this is such a good direction for weki meki’s title tracks! i hope the girls will proceed to do more of this in future songs! <3
Woow!! de donde salieron tantas vistas en solo un dia? :00
Berawal suka astro, terus kepo doyeon jd suka weki meki udah setaun ini

위키미키 뮤직비디오 나올때마다 댓글에 팬들이 위키미키는 바지입고 완전 빡센안무로 칼군무하면 좋겠다라는 댓글이 항상 나왔는데 이게 그게 반영된 완벽한 곡이네요 ... 이거봐..뮤비도 사람들이 더 많이보잖아 위키미키는 칼군무가 장점이라 안무 살리면 흥하게 되있어 ...아직 팬덤이 약해서 음원 성적은 어쩔수 없는데 무대로 이슈되고 핫해지면 음원도 같이올라올거임 지금 인기 급상승 영상49위던데 더 올라가자!

Lezzgo 2M!!
This reminds me of CLC - 'No' a bit and I love the Vogue vibes on the other hand,  what else do I need? I feel so happy and proud of the girls. My bias Elly ain't even shining as much but I can feel that any member was neglected, all of them look gorgeous and precious, everyone shined here and everything was really cool indeed. I've always said this but Doyeon and Lucy make me so gay, lmao.
Less than 7k for 2M in less than 24 hours
Just unbelievable, perfect.
Ki-lings you all can do it fighting!! You all are doing very well   Also you definitely have Arohas as your backup
Road to 2M Guyss!!! And it is not yet 24 hours... THIS COMEBACK OF THEM IS REALLY A BOP. Finally people are slowly recognizing their talent 😍 WEKI MEKI HWAITING!!!
THIS IS SO GOOD AAAAA
WEKI MEKI POWER QUEENS
Lets hit 2M before 24 hrs. Fighting!!!!! Keep the views coming.
Only 10k to 2M we are doing great!! Keep going ~
2M!!!!!!!!!!!
They are all really good dancers, remind me of Ateez almost, relatively newer group, that has no member lacking in the dance department. And Doyeon killed this.
Ki-lings are planning to not vote on starplay for this week , since tracking week ends on friday (today) and we got only 1 day so every ki-ling should wait for the next week and not waste your vote for this week
nos faltan solo 10k de visitas re poquitooo vamos k-ling
Estoy orgullosa de lo duro que están trabajando las chicas para ser reconocidas en Corea del Sur y todo el mundo, a pesar de todos los problemas que han tenido con su empresa, ellas saben cómo brillar sin duda 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️

AAAAAAA NO FALTA NADAA!!
stan talents
stan weki meki
OK, yeah, Weki Meki is officially in my top 5 favorite groups, i was waiting for another comeback until i put them in the top 5, and this did it.   This is an AMAZING comeback.  Let's see...  First the video, well, they all look beautiful (a shame that Sei has just a little screen time), but they look amazing, this is one of those videos you cannot stop looking, you just cannot look away, is eye catching, very well made video, the colors, the lighting on point, i don't see a very hard camera work, but it works, i like the aspect ratio they used too.  Then, the song, just in the beggining you can hear that is gonna be good, those 4 first notes describe the song, strong kinda edm cool groovie song, the chorus is just as expected, PERFECT, the only part i don't quite like is that 1:11 part, those 2 lines are kinda like a Red Velvet song, it doesn't really fit in the song, but the rest is just great, the way that powerful chorus drops with that "COOL!" just after the build up is overwhelming, the bridge is also well made, the rap parts, the production behind this is very nice.  And finally, the choreo, i have to say im impressed that it looks like a boy group choreo, but hot, is agresive but sexy at the same time.   I think im gonna be "humming" this song for the next days, this is really catchy, WELL DONE Weki Meki and Fantagio!

1.7M alreadyyyy, keep streaminggggggg  #위키미키 #WekiMeki #NEW_RULES
I like this song!
One of the main features of Weki Meki's music is the thing that they do with the vibe. The mess with the vibe or the mood so much. You can't fix the vibe. Initially I found it difficult but later I started enjoying it. It has different flavours.  Many kpop songs switch vibes but I think it is more confusing in Weki Meki.
Last time I checked it was 300k, now 1.6M!!!! views exploded!!!! :D Weki Meki is back!!!
💓👄💓
ĐỈNH QUÁ ÔI CHỜI
Me innocently clicking the Play button... Weki Meki: This is how things are gonna be from now on! Me: Yes ma'am!!!
Vamos 300k más y lo logramos

I really want to sleep but i wanna see 2M...
The message is so cool??? Wow
This comeback slaps so hard.
Ki-Lings fighting!!! ya mismo 2 millones Aroha presente apoyando
Wow this is soooooo COOL!!!!!
Right now, a LOT of girl groups' producers, song writers, composers, etc. have been trying to release THIS song but have always fell short, were a little too heavy handed, or just felt out didn't give enough actual substance to. This is one of the very few songs that if stans called it a feminist anthem, I would 100% agree. Weki Meki has been tearing it up this year, they might be the first group I stan since 2016!
2M VIEWS?IN 24 HOURS?
This needs to be his breakthrough please let's end the IOI malediction.
Love it... this is really good👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
so cool thank you for this amazing song :)) love youuu <3
NEW RULES indeed!!! YEAH!
Why this is so cool 🔥😭
STAN WEKI MEKI

a filipino fan you're looking at
*Whenever I listen to this song I feel like I'm at a fashion runaway*
1.6M even it's still not 24hrs.. I'm so proud
THIS IS OFFICIALLY LUCY AND LUAS ERA
I'm just really thankful for their company for every quality comebacks that they've given to these talented girls. Other companies that own a girlgroup should TAKE NOTE and not give up but give continuous comeback instead until the group is well known to the public. I really really hope weki meki will win with this comeback. Hwaiting!!
What a nice song
Gila nih weme. Mana nih fans Indonesia? Jangan tutup telinga kalian woy. Lagu mereka gak pernah ngecewain.
PERIODDD
I knew two girls from IOI are here but I mert then because Suyeon at KOMS she is absolutelly beautiful and her voice is af nice. Also she looks like LimexYoonjoo daughter hahaha the sobg is catchy
This sounds so different and “cool” haha I like it!!
Girl with the short green hair is fire🔥🔥🔥
im in so much shock...omg this is such an amazing comeback

메이크업, 의상, 퍼포먼스. 이 짧은 무비로도 알 수 있네 이번에 판타지오 완전 이 갈았다는 거. 바지 계속 입히고, 새로운 컨셉 계속 도전하는 거 너무 멋지다 !! 사실 귀에 쏙 박히는 파트는 없는데 조금이라도 이 그룹에 호감이 있다면 이 노래는 마음속에서 찜꽁이다
Genial!!!

Wow everything about this era is so on point. As someone who just "likes" their songs, this is their best so far. It impressed me. If only clubs were open to jam to this now.  The video kinda reminds me of CLC's No (the colours and sets) but in a good way. Both songs are really cool (no pun intended).
EN 17 HORAS MÁS DE UN MILLÓN DE V¡3WS, ME MUERO VOY A LLORAR
Ay ay ay ay🎶🎶🎶

Wow wow
Catchy sound 💯💯💯
happy 1mill views !!
This is the concept this group has been WAITING FOR.  And I say that with all the respect and love for their previous concepts, but I've been watching them since debut and they've always been this strong and powerful and rap/urban dance focused, and they needed this concept to show that off so beautifully, it's like the stars aligned! This feels both new and still so THEM.  I've been waiting for people to stop sleeping on them, but now they've really taken a huge step forward and created such a unique but powerful concept, I really hope they get their first win.  If we could get BTS attention from an even smaller company, we can get Weki Meki attention now!
1M OH YESSS FINALLY
Yah 1M! Keep it going, people,pls. STR3*M!!!

I am counting on 1M views in 24hrs. Let's stream harder so that they'll top the charts and gain more appreciation!   #WEKIMEKI_1ST_WIN #COOL_1ST_WIN
Duda? Quiero saber quiénes son esas hermosas arohas que están ayudando haciendo stream este MV  Ayudemos arohas apoyemos a las hermanitas de ASTRO  FAMILY FANTAGIO   Empiezo yo AROHA PRESENTE
Creo que tanto cambio de conceptos buscando cual vende más la está cagando, este mal manejo de la empresa se nota en cada comeback, aquí le pusieron mucho las pilas pero la verdad el tema...el concepto no me gustó, siempre vi a weki como algo enérgico que te llena la batería con una cancion pegadiza. Este cambio creo que no le vino bien, fue como muy precipitado cuando no tiene ni siquiera estabilidad de fan base todavía...
I wasn’t feeling the song very much, but the production and quality of the music video is really amazing and all the girls did their thing again 👏👏
Aroha here!!!! Let’s get that first win for Weki Meki!!!!
Am I the only one striping on my room while listening to this? Cuz I'm feeling sooooo COOL
Let's go ki-lings! 1million is close!
There is no waste to this MV!!, 💯🤯

WekiMeky comeback to slay us
OR 2 MILLION? LET'S GO KI-LINGS ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
Nunca me llamaron la atención las canciones de Weki Meki debido al título (y perdónenme por lo que voy a decir pero es mi opinión) me parecían algo ridículos los títulos y su concepto no fue de mi agrado pero debo decir que Cool es arte    PD: Siento mucho si se ofendieron y se que probablemente las chicas no eligen el concepto o el nombre de la canción pero como ya dije, es mi opinión y si la expresó con respeto es válida ^^
let's go for 1M
Love it!!  Moomoo supporting Weki Meki baby girls <3
Lets try to hit a million in the first 24 hours we can do it
I have exam ill be back babies🥺❤️
Its increasing🥺

Love reading all of the thirsty commenters loosing it over Lua lol  This woman has ruined us all it seems...

fuckin masterpiece
この日のために生きてました。 最高です
Let's go to 9k comments! We can do it!
This is the definition of girl power
Like literally what does this industry want from Weki Meki..Like they've done almost every concept there is..And they've got most things a girl group should..i really dont get why ppl r sleeping on them
a lot of the set seems inspired by vanitas paintings and how each object symbolises different things which is really nice to see and what kind of objects they decided to used to represent this music video
Si con este comeback no tienen su 1st win entonces entonces no saben apreciar arte
weki meki world domination!!!!
AYAYAYAYAYAYAAAAA
Stan Weki Meki = Stan arteeeeeee
They are so talented <3
they are GOING places with this one omg .... i love them

*I don't stan Weki Meki but I've been following them since their Dazzle Dazzle comeback..* *and I've even I have to admit people are really sleeping on them, it's disappointing.* *But what's also disappointing is what I mentioned last time... The timing.* *I know timing is always rough in the kpop world but they did this to them last time too with Weki Meki with Oopsie, that song was a bop but it came out around the same time around the big names came out like Twice, BP etc..* *and now they did it again with BP just releasing a their title track a few days ago.* *And everyone else is trying to get their stuff out this month because of MAMA...* *Anyway Weki Meki is a talented group I can see it...*

TENDENCIA #14 EN ARGENTINA
OMG! Me encanto este cambio de genero musical, osea que ahira son rudas,  anteriormente las vimos muy cutes y tiernas dulces :3 pero con las nuevas reglas sacaron su lado oscuro y rudo :0 Me encanto el mv, sus outfit,bla calidad del video, la cancion y mas con esos raps oh wooow. 10/10 para "COOL" y su nuevo estilo :D
Omg my girls, I LOVE IT SO MUCH . <3 ㅜㅜ
Lo amee
I looked and shouted: PERFECTION
Ji suyeon reminds me of hyeongjun from pd101x
NO U DONT UNDER STANDDDD I CRIED WHEN I SAW LUAS HAIR I AM CRYINGGGGGGG
So I’ve been on the here for a couple of hours to listen and watch them sing and dance. What I like about this title track the most is that they are nailing the girl crush concept. It’s about encouraging every individual to be confident. To not follow the rules somebody set. Not in the wrong way, but how you express yourself like how you do art. How to have self love! This comeback is so lit 👏👏👏💜 love you wekimeki
Can't wait to see Elmo again!!

i dont understand why they’re not bigger, like they’re so talented and always hit it out of the park w cbs...they should be on the same level as groups like gidle or everglow (jus using as a comparison) ...if they had debuted this year i know they would have been getting wins w debut & each cb :c i hope they can get more recognition soon 💞😼‼️

i hope no one will attack me, because i want to criticise the company, not the members who are in my opinion too talented and worked too hard to not be treated well by their company. with every comeback i really really hope the company will finally put as much creativity and effort into the mv and promotion as astro, but you really don't have to be a filmmaker to see how much more effort they put into the very recent astro subunit. that's not hate for any group, because i like them both, but.. let's be honest even with a low budget you can get much more creative and make more unique choices and have an actual concept. tacky fashion is absolutely great and i'd be here for it if it seemed whoever chose it really had some idea of what they wanted to do with it. why put them in those weird patterned clothes with lots of colors but only when the background is also.. chaotic, making it hard to even really focus on anything and looking cluttered. and that's not a personal opinion that's visible in all kinds of movies and music videos... the girls are talented and great and the company seriously does not deserve them

YES I've been waiting for a female idol to have short hair!!!
I hope this will be their breakthrough song. They deserve it so much. Please get at least one win. October is such hard competition.😭😭
I can't stop listening to this song ommmg
If you believe that there’s no God and that nothing made the universe. Then if God is no-thing and therefore is nothing. Then can’t the universe come from him?  Also if you believe that the universe is infinite; then how is it that our bodies are part of the universe whilst our consciousness is also part of our bodies whilst our consciousness came into existence via our birth? This means that our consciousness is finite because it began, there for our bodies are finite and finally the universe MUST be finite...This is what Islam promotes...
Yeaaah let's go guys weki meki first win let's do this
Just a passerby, but I really loved this song. Adding it to my playlist!!!

WEKI MEKI 1ST WIN MARK MY WORD!
❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I don't really know their names or anything but I just love that they didn't try to make the short haired lady look extra boyish and androgynous. don't get me wrong, I like all styles but I still love feminine girls with short hair and there are not enough of those in kpop! so thanks for that to whoever decided that!
Cool tan linda las chicas
TENDENCIA #17 EN ARGENTINA!!
I LOOVE that this is a darker concept for them but it still has that Weki Meki sound 😭😭 a lot of groups don’t do that anymore thank you queens
Yup, that's it. I stan now.
omg this is like a fuse of runway vibes and club bangers
this song is amazing ahhhhh love from Portugal
What I like the most in Weki Meki is: they have their own style, never copying other groups. I hope people in Korea finally gives the attention this girls deserves. The music is good, the MV is simple but COOL and elegant and the girls are extremely beautiful and talented. And Lua's hair is the definition of COOL.
The girl with short black hair, and green hair is so pretty omg
Suyeon and Lua looking like whole girlfriends. Also the raps OWNED me

The best girls.
this group is the 2nd gayest thing i've ever seen after loona. i stan
LUA SHORT HAIR YES OMG YES

Guess I’ll have to stan then
DOYEON: PERFECTION RINA: PERFECTION LUA: PERFECTION SUYEON: PERFECTION YOOJUNG: PERFECTION ELLY: PERFECTION LUCY: PERFECTION SEI: PERFECTION COOL: PERFECTION
I really love Weki Meki but I have something to share about my insights on their comeback. This is not a hate but c'mon Sei, Rina, Lua and Lucy always got the lowest lines distributions. (yeah I know that they are only sub vocals and not the main something on the group) I kinda feel sorry for Sei, yes she got 9.0% and placing 5th spot for lines distributions but some of her lines are just "Ohh Ohh Ohh" deym! And second, is it me or she has the least screentime on this video? When she sings her solo part, the video was focused on the other, oh crap! But still, i'll be rooting them and hoping for their first win.
This vibe is very different. I don’t really what genre to put this on (on kpop that is). Honestly, i would listen to this repetitively but sadly they’ve lost momentum to gain more fans. It’s sad since i love Doyeon, Lucy, Sei and Soyeon.
Someone please tell who's the girl with short hair? She's drop dead gorgeous.
I love Weki Meki's choreography they are always so fun and creative. Plus their synchronization is on point.

They haven’t had a bad song yet!!! Seriously getting more into these girls they’re major! Been a Kpop fan for way too many years and I see serious potential, just depends if they make a song their Korean audience really enjoys again like crush. This is an amazing comeback🎉🎉
This sounds like the songs that’s played in a runway show and it makes sense because they do look like models
Cool queens love u But i hope the sound of them in the course was more clear

They deserve much more recognition! Lua has always been my bias, and I never imagined that she would look so amazing with her short hair, I hope she leaves it like that for longer, she has been with this hair for a long time, but it is impossible to get sick of this masterpiece.
YAS QUEENS
you think 2020 is the worst but its not when we got these suit concept going around girlgroups  Dreamcatcher-Scream CLC-Helicopter Weki Meki-COOL  idk if there are groups did the suit concept like them bcs idk a lot but their songs is a total slap to 2020  WE WON,GAYS

ok some fierce dancing~
The girl with short hair is my new lesbian crush
What a unique sound... I did not expect this from Weki Meki.  Ki-lings know how cool and amazingly catchy this is though ~!
Me: raging over homework 247 Choi Yoo-jung: take it easy
weki meki just made you feel like you just watched a runway show. I AM FLOORED!!
Ah caray! Si me gustó mucho!

LET'S GO WITH THIS BANGER
Anyone notice that Dodange couple dance together HAHAHA ❤️❤️❤️ so cuteee
YESSSSSSSS
its over for all lesbians
their songs are always so catchy how are they still underrated!!!
Love this!!!
All members  can do rap vocal and dance and its called talent but we read like weki meki  STAN WEKI MEKI BUT THEY ARE TOO UNDERRATED OOF I personally like more tiki taka, oppsy and others but this not bad anyways they are so amazing
The painting behind them where they were dancing most of the time i have seen in any other mv also bt i cannot remeber can anyone
This music video is very different for a girl group and I honestly love it. It has a lot of masculine/boygroup elements (the dance outfits, some of the choreography, the rap scene; the song in general also reminds me of a BG song) that aren't very common in girl groups and I really love to see that.
Essa música poderia facilmente tocar em qualquer passarela em desfiles de moda!
Always proud of WEME!! This is amazing
SO ORIGINAL! i love it
YUPPP
Who still with me?
i'm not a fan but i always look up to their cbs and they never dissapoint me, they're truly one of the best ggroups in the industry

Congrats 🎉 you're in French trend !!
Does anyone else get a boy group vibe from this song especially when they wear the white outfits. I really love and appreciate that because we're accustomed to seeing girl groups act overly girly or sexy. Now we have chill.
siempre sacan altos temas con buena producción de vídeo, ojalá empiecen a ser más reconocidas por favor
"Cu, cu, cu" kskskdj

I smell a first win. These girls deserve it soooooo much. Sei, Lua, and Rina with part of the chorus is so amazing.
The instumentel is super nice and weki weki singing is great to but to me it feels like the the instrumental and singing are to different songs ... or am I missing something?

I think I'm in love. they look really awesome. this song. it let me speechless. their voice is awesome, their dance is cool, they look so beautiful.  Es la canción mas genial que he escuchado en este año, y el baile fue estupendo, y esa parte donde están en pedestales fue maravillosa, y eso de bailar frente a frente, y sus voces wow sus voces siempre son bellísimas, y sus vestuarios se ven tan geniales, esos trajes blancos fueron mis favoritos, se ven tan elegantes y hermosas y creo que despertaron un lado de mi que no conocía.  Además cada que veo a Lucy me doy cuenta que están creciendo tan rápido, me siento tan orgullosa de ellas. I love them so much.
IT'S SO GOOD 🥺🥺
This is my first song from them, this is not so like other girl groups, no offence all of them are talented queens but this is SO GOOD LIKE WHAT?!
BEST COMBACK OF THE YEAR. HONESTLY
You know Madonna's Vogue? Haha this feels like it. 😂  They should have had Voguing as choreography.
THIS IS AMAZING

More people need to stan these girls!
These girls are my everything I see a come back by them I click super quick
Okay song of the year, it's official.
THEY'RE MY BABIES.
They never disappoint
*WOW THIS SONG SLAPS!*  *Weki Meki fighting!* Also some of their outfits reminds me of *Zimzalabim from Red Velvet!*
Fanta run the ads for Weki Meki, please!!!

Из последних гг релизов этот понравился мне больше всего. Особенно по части хореографии, просто огонь 🔥 아주 멋진 클립! 여자는 좋은!)
Asigiiimmm
Las amoi
Kendinizi aşmissiniz kizlariiiimm
Yuhhhhhhhhhh
AROHA 💜 aquí, familia Fanmu apoyando!
*The iconic short green haired girl is Lua!* *I'm happy everyone is asking her name.*
I like that they're keeping the bright and fresh sound whilst being chic, groups these days are getting a dark sound and concept which get boring and seeing this brightens my day!
Na minha opinião, é uma desilusão
Lyrics Translation : yes!
wey super quedó 💅👀ame
This song is the best
I'm not a Weki Meki Stan but this song slaps hard
AAAAA me encanta
Trap elegante
All of their title tracks never dissapoint~
my day has been blessed ✨✨
Dios
Me encanto demasiado
this their best comeback, why this group is so underrated. i hate that people don’t see the TALENT OF THIS GIRLS. THEY HAVE THE BEST CHOREOGRAPHY IN THE 4TH GENERATION.
I'm not a fan but really this song should be a hit, it's really good this song I didn't expect this kind of song and concept of weki meki since the previous songs I've heard of them have a cute concept you could say
일단 비주얼 넘 좋고 노래 좋은데 좀 아쉽다. 감각적이면서도 제목처럼 쿨한 느낌 그리고 춤선이 진짜 예뻐야할 것 같은데 ㅠㅠ 쪼꼼 아쉽 안맞는 옷 같은? 멤버들이 틴크러시 같은 통통 튀면서 활기찬 안무를 잘해서 그런지 아쉽다 ㅠㅠ
KI-LINGS X AROHAS
Pls don't give up ki-lings Rohas are always beside u

No soy fan pero realmente esta canción debería ser un hit, está buenísima esta canción no me esperaba este tipo de música y concepto de weki meki ya q las anteriores canciones que eh escuchado de ellas tienen un concepto cute se podría decir
The amount of people asking who's the short green haired girl. Her name is Lua. You can follow her on Instagram https://instagram.com/soo_kyungyi?igshid=py1ij6mf0si3
I don't know why people sleep on them, they are so COOL, the song is amazing and a BOP the kpop community need to know about WEKI MEKI. We Ki-Lings let's do a 10M views who's with me!!! Bc the song is so COOL!!
Suyeon: Everyday I just wanna dance  Me: Can I be your dance floor?? Because you can literally step on me all day
Esto si es música cool es una de mis músicas favoritas vamos por mas
For me, Cool is one of their absolute best title tracks!
Suyeon: Who is the rapper? Other members: Yes!

so good
THEY REALLY SAID WE DO IT FOR THE GIRLS AND THE GAYS THATS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
YALL BETTER NOT FUCKING SLEEP ON THIS MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!! GET THEM THEIR FIRST WINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
WOW
the choreography is AMAZING!!!
🥺💜✨
I like it but I do not love it.   As always, the girls are gorgeous and the choreo is on point, but the MV is just a mix between Dazzle Dazzle aesthetics and Oopsy dark tone.  The song felt weird to me because it goes all over the place. They tried something new and that is good, so I hope this song grow on me eventually.  I love Weki Meki and I am happy that we got several comebacks this year so I hope they do well and I am already wondering what is next. Cheers~~
This MV is pure art
OMGGGGGG

This gives me nct 127 vibes

ok this is literally everyone’s era omg
they are really really underrated..... love wekimeki
SIEMPRE HACEN ARTE
How is it possible Wekimeki had THREE comebacks this year and every release is just peak perfection? Peak production? Peak styling and peak mv? Peak talent? Hello?????? Others should stop sleeping on them!!! They're fantastic!!
LAS AMO
WEKI MEKI REINAS
OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF SOUND I WAS NEEDING AND WANTING RIGHT NOW!!!!!
already addicted! wow
Ugh man that's really cool...
the talent? the 'fits? the switchups? the choreo? the 2000's art pop dance vibes? weki meki Did That.
LUA!!!!
COOL COOL COOLLLL WTF ARTEEEEEEEEEEE ME A ENCANTADO NO ME LO ESPERABA
GET IT WEKI MEKI!!!
let's go weki meki
This is epic. They need 10 millions viw3s.
Wow this is so different from all their other stuff. I feel this is the kind of song a boy group would release. The choreo too also gives me a bg vibe
OMMGMGMGG BEST COMEBACK THIS YEAR
SOTY
I seriously love how almost every Weki Meki MV is so aesthetic and how they've been sticking to a minimalist concept lately. I can appreciate their visuals more and focus how artsy the direction is. Like almost every frame is a painting and a mood ♡
YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP
01:12 eu entendi BOLSONARO  Tá repreendido um troço feio desse nessa beleza de música.
HOLY SHIT
i love the disco vibe sooo much
Siempre apoyando a la familia fantagio  By aroha
Entregaram TUDO
wow just wow? this song is so good, the whole album is A+
fanmu legends

I never really crushed on Lua, but now I think i'm gay for her... O.o  crazy stunning
이번 노래는 좀 더 특별하고 멋지고 아름다움 이랄까?♡♡
Weki meki
I LOVE these outfits!!! It feels like 90's fashion vibes and I just LOVE it!!!!!
Weki meki
cool cool cool
I feel like they matured fairly quickly and are girl crush and elegant then teen crush now and they are really pulling it off
let's get to 6k comments

비트 대박 좋다 사비부분👍 부내난다 부내나
It's sound so different from their song before. it's show more girl crush concept and one Lua got more line in this song.
I don’t think there is any weki meki song that I don’t like! I for real got goosebumps on the high notes! Weki Meki delivers again and doesn’t disappoint!! They all look amazing, love the choreo, love the clothes, and omg loooove the hairstyles 😻
okayy stanning

While I dont like this song so much (I am more a fan of vocal flexing XD ), I must admit that Suyeon (she is my bias) is wrecking me really hard here, she looks amazing!
Love this song

Calling all arohas to give support and stream!
Weki Meki es ARTE PURO. LPM Lua me dejó por el piso.
위키미키 어떻게 매번 곡들이 최고를 갱신할까... 이번 곡은 진짜 진짜 너무 좋다... 글구 이번 착장 너무 좋다 특히 화이트ㅠ 불필요한 노출 불편한 의상 전혀 아닌...
old q amo
Sorry, but there are soo many sounds at a time it's just noise at this point.

Wow lets first win guys 🔥🔥🔥
if this doesn't get weki meki their first win then 2020 has really been a scam year
oh my god it’s so good
fun fact: here in brazil, “cool” means literally “ass”, so seems like they’re singing “ASS, ASS, ASS” lmao
0:09 satisfying moves 😫
This song is so goooood, wow, I wasn't expecting this at all. It makes me want to know the members
Suyeon's dancing really stands out

I've been delaying my moment of stanning Weki Meki, but this is the Comeback, I have to stan them now. Guess who's going to watch unhelpful guides for Weki Meki today?
Wkmk keep improving for every comeback and they never release bad song
Oh yeah Fanmu translated eng cc. Fighting Weki Meki!

Agora o reconhecimento vem
I hate myself for not knowing the name of my favorite rapper
Cool!!!
here before 1m views 😌   OMG I LOVE THIS PLEASE LET WEME GET THEIR FIRST WIN WITH THIS COME ON KI-LINGS WE GOT THIS!!!!!
Unpopular opinion: They're 1 of well balanced girlgroup in dancing, you can see that they're in the same form even thought they're height is not the same
been a stan since “i don’t like you girlfriend” era but got out of touch with them and now, i better be updated with them ! this is so amazing 😭 love these girls so much ♥️
Weme never disappoints!!! Hoping for their first win 😭😭😭💖💖💖
COOL SOTY !!
Very nice
The short haired girl with green highlights looks sooooooooo good
Queen of Kpop Weki Meko, Loves it!
아ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 너무 좋아 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 어떻게 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I LOVE ATEEZZZZZZZZZZ😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
The girls are cool just for being themselves, not for following the standards or doing this or that concept, they are cool for their effort and quality work with this comeback♡♡♡
Fanmu family let's do this  Aroha X Ki-ling
This is THE song.
I cant with LuA, Bye beaches🚶🥴
period
What they did to Lua’s hair...
wow, I'm speechless. the song is definitely a masterpiece, the music video looks really great and has some gorgeous details, the choreography is so stunning and their outfits are so beautiful.  I'm totally in love w this comeback!!
Ngl this hits harddddd

that was so cool!
How i didn't know about this group?  Well i guess better late than never.
they've grown so much, I'm so proud of them ❤️
Doyeon's look is unmatched, god she's just flawless.
I have trouble breathing while watching this...
Go Weki Meki!!!! Fighting!!!!
판타지오는 이대로만 계속 해주면 될 것 같네욯ㅎㅎㅎ 나중엔 멤버들이 안무 창작도 하면 너무 좋을 듯! 예전에 창작해서 춤춘 것도 그렇고 2:19 유정이가 생각했다던데 이정도면 안무가님이랑 같이 만들어도 좋을 것 같아요!
Lucy🥺
Realmente el MV es Cool
COOL!!! *with sparkling eyes*
Choi Yoojung is a triple threat I told yall
Ohhh yeas
This just confirms my theory that Weki Meki can only make spectacular music
Hagan stream, gentee.
Wow
to be honest, in Kpop industry, if you don't own a catchy song, you have to produce a unique MV that shows your style. If you don't sing well, you have to own your unique visual. first time to listen to this, can't sense it =,= sorry
SLAYYYYYYY
Now THAT'S a comeback!!! Weme you're doing really great and the mv is amazing
I have no idea about this group but this song made me to start following them
Love that Lua is breaking the norm with her hairstyle  <3
Queen❤️
such a great song, I love it!! 🥰
엘리언니 사랑해요ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ❤❤
엘리언니 사랑해요ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ❤❤
KI-LINGS HOW THE FRICK ARE WE FEELING?
I love weki meki!! They are super underrated.
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE BOP
ITS SOO GOOOD 😭😭😭
ARTE
WEKI MEKI WORLD DOMINATION
Maravilhosasssss ❤❤❤❤❤
they SNAPPED!! stan WEKI MEKI!!!! 😤🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 and lua’s hair is everything bro! 😍🥺❤️
okay so i’m not a stan but i’ve been a casual listener of weki meki for a year now and honestly?? this song blew my mind. this is so refreshing and new, and untypical for a girl group to promote for a title track. usually music like this would often be the popular bside but i’m so genuinely surprised by how great it is. that’s it. i’m officially a fan. what do i call myself? what do i watch? i want to know more about them.
English subtitles is already available for us yall
i'm just here for Yves Wife :B
NOT GONNA LIE THEY SNAPPED
Holder is the most talented producer I've ever known
Some of the parts of the song and the mv are really nice and interesting..I thought it would have been another one of those recently overly used girlcrush theme ..but  instead it was kinda differently produced..and some of the parts were easy to listen..esp. yoojungs rap
NOOO ARTE Las empecé a stanear hace un año y no me arrepiento ,ojalá se lleven su primer win
Para americanos: cool :) Para os brasileiros: cu :0 *for Americans: cool For Brazilians: Ass :0
Lua and Lucy shined sm this era  Im so happy🥺❤❤❤
판타지오 이대로 가자 윜밐 성공해야해
doyeonnnnnn

Even better than I expected. Great!

weki meki has seen better cb tbh
Weki Meki fighting!!! comeback successfully!
정말 정말 멋져요, 여러분 사랑 해요 :))
this song is so LIT, this concept is suitable for them most
루아 스타일이 너무 잘 어울려서 계속 눈이간다!
give these girls their first win
As a lifeguard, all the whistles in that song have my blood pressure at unhealthily high levels. AGH
This song could've been a good sensual, vibe and stylist deephouse with R&B touches, but some of those wierd up-beat melodies didn't help withd that... they feel out of place.
weki meki honestly suits the girl crush concept 🤩
Weki Meki has the best concepts among the girl groups and this one of the best of the year!
A música viciante, os visuais absurdamente lindos, a coreografia impecável, o conceito único. Eu estou em choque.
A bop
AYAYAYAYA
i insanely love the hipster vibes coming from this
Melhor comeback do Weki Meki. Simplesmente PERFEITO.
2:19 esta escena ♡
This HAS to give them their first win
판타지오는 진짜 윜밐 컨셉 다른거 생각하지말고 지금처럼 쭉 하이틴스타 느낌 나고 매력있는 컨셉으로 계속 해주길 진짜 위키미키 너무 좋아 다들 행복했으면 좋겠어

후렴보다 랩파트가 왜케 좋냐ㅠㅠ
HOLY SHI-  My favorite is still dazzle dazzle but DAMN this SLAPS so hard!!!! And the production went up we love that for our girls!!!!
reproduzcan mucho, merecen su first win♡
2:14 I live for suyeon's hairflip

Stream streamm streammm

En este comeback se ve que han aportado más en todos los aspectos para Weki Meki . He seguido a Weki Meki por más de dos años pero no puedo decir con confianza que soy Ki-ling porque aún creo que no estoy lo sificiente  informada. Pero estoy orgullosa de ellas y espero que ganen un premio porque se lo merecen. Fighting!  Hagamos str✓am
the makeup artist SNAPPED they look so gooood
It's so chill and hype for me at the same time, thank you for this masterpiece :)
WOW!!  It's really COOL!!  Fighting Weki Meki!!
I don’t stan Weki Meki but I know Yoojung and Doyeon. And damn who’s that girl with the short hair?
LA ESTÉTICA, LA CANCIÓN, LA COREOGRAFÍA, TODO
This is the first time I am watching them.... Their outfits are so unique and cool😍😍😍😍
ME ENCANTA
처음엔 좋다가 한 2분 40쯤되니까 노래가 왤케 길지?란 생각이 듦.. 뭔가 보통 노래랑 다르게 점점 흥나는 게 아니라 구조가 많이 나눠져 있어서 지루한 느낌... 근데 이미지 바꾼 점은 너무 좋음 여러 장르 도전해보는 것도 좋은 선택이라고 생각함
OMG, I love this comeback, Lua's hair OMG
LEGENDS
fantagio fam
Weki meki=🌏❤
*Red Velvet's Rookie: Hi* *Nature's Oopsie (My Bad): Hi*  *Weki Meki's Cool: Hi too*
si yo digo, altas reinas a quienes me refiero?? y por que weki meki aa stan weki meki
As a fellow shorthaired girl I have endless love for other shorthaired girls but I am now legally obligated to sue Lua because she killed me with that look
New era, pretty girl
WOW Lua and Rina..... those hair styles and colors look SO good on them! I'm just a casual listener but I think I'm in love

This song deserves a win but the timing is terrible because blackpink just had a comeback so no matter which song is better blackpink will win because of the larger fan base. I wish they released this a little earlier or later.
This gives me So What vibes I absolutely love it
COOL
THE SCENE IN 2:20 WAS SO GORGEOUS
Too much cool 😍
OMG LUA😍🤤
Big groups don't promote themselves on THE SHOW. Thats why we have to win THE SHOW at all cost. Start collecting in Star Play. Buy the albums more. Stream the song more on kplatforms like bugs,genie,melon. We can do it. FIGHTING!!!!
loved it!!!!!!!!
who is the short dyed green girl?
0:48 quien es ella que me enamoré ah.
great
WEKI MEKI FIRST WIN!
great
Woaaa this is so cool  I m not a fan but I will keep an eye on them from now on
This is by far my pick for SOTY 2020, it's just amazing!!!! Let's go for Weki Meki's  first win!!!
from what I know weki meki isn't the most popular group so I'm happy that their company regularly gives them comebacks! really got into them when they released Picky Picky and every song since has been so good!
oh。。。。。。。。。。。
타팬인데 도입부부터 훅 빨려들어감ㅜㅜ 컨셉도 파격적이고 뭣보다 편하고 멋진복장입고 진정한 찐간지란 다 보여주는게 너무 최고라고 생각함 제대로 칼갈고나온듯 반했다,,. 앞으로도 이렇게 쭉 밀고갔음좋겠다 위키미키 화이팅
WIZ*ONES streaming Cool ^^
THIS SLAPS
Omg this sounds amazing. Everyone's vocals on point and that Choreo, Wow so COOL. Certified bop
Dammit kpop there are just too many girl groups. I don't stand Weki Meki but I love this song.
Weki Meki just proofs again that they really can't release a bad title track
Well thats our queen
Why this group is so underrated 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 their vocals is perfect Their visuals is perfect Their rapping is perfect Their dance moves so perfect And their music is awesome
Perfeito amei, yoojung perfeita como sempre S2.
Lua te amooooo
Everglow - Aidos And CLC - Me Vibe Anyone? 🤔

So Weki Meki doesn't have a bad song saga continues...
Weki Meki, a group that can give us everything. Dazzle Dazzle is nothing like OOPSY and OOPSY is nothing like COOL. Amazing!   ps: DOYEON I LOVE YOU!
Que hermosas son
THIS IS A BANGER!!!!!
I really like the direction Weki Meki is going with their music.....the fans from Day 1 probably feel like the music is getting more mainstream but I think it has a good balance of their unique charm and easier on the ears sound.
Arteeeee
this comeback is just goes OFF!! holy crap it’s like they mixed elegance with runway music and this is the outcome... weki meki really be feeding us amazing comebacks this year
I am SO in love with the start of the song
한마디 하겠습니다 ...            👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Aún existen mujeres heteros al mismo tiempo que weki meki?????? Cómo es posible?????
Wow
Lua te amo NO PODÉS SER TAN HERMOSA CHABONA DISOOOOO su carita es perfecta tallada por los mismo dioses
We always says they deserve a win and. We should prove it!!

Lyrics Translation :  The first thing people say when they see me is cool cool cool I don’t just quietly follow along I make my own new rules Curiosity and interest fill me up Everything I do is spontaneous Ya hear me now hear me now Ya feel me now feel me now Cool Everything around me is so planned So frustrating, suffocating Let some fresh air pass Through those clogged up thoughts, take it easy I don’t hold back, alright I have no fear I need to do everything In order to move on, that’s my style It’s beautiful Just as I am I’m alright Everyone follow follow follow follow me Wake wake wake yourself up Ay ay ay ay Cool, make it hot So you can’t handle it, bring it back Ay ay ay ay Cool, make it more fun So their predictions are wrong I wanna switch it up Keep it coming baby Escape all the boring rules (that’s right) Cuz we can just change it up (hey) From my head to my toes I do what I want, I do me Every every day I just wanna dance Dane, dance Don’t wanna keep stopping Imagine how it’ll be Being so neat as if measured by a ruler Is so boring, yawn, I never want to be It’s beautiful Just as I am I’m alright Everyone follow follow follow follow me Wake wake wake yourself up Ay ay ay ay Cool, make it hot So you can’t handle it, bring it back Ay ay ay ay Cool, make it more fun So their predictions are wrong I wanna switch it up Keep it coming baby Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh (Ay ay ay) Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh (Ay ay ay ah) Oh oh oh oh You know our style Our colors don’t overlap But we never act rude I ain’t that so wild so buck wild ah oh If you want something new, follow me It’s here, the recipe If you want something new, follow me Only I know this recipe My newly changed self This feeling of finding something new No one can stop me You know what’s up Cool, make it hot So you can’t handle it, bring it back Ay ay ay ay Cool, make it more fun So their predictions are wrong I wanna switch it up Keep it coming baby Escape all the boring rules (that’s right) Cuz we can just change it up (hey) From my head to my toes I do what I want, I do me  You can find many translations in high quality in our page > https://twitter.com/pop_gasa (don't forget follow us) ^^

THEY NEVER MISS
This HITS HARD
SuYeon 🥺❣️❣️❣️
suyeon thank you for being alive
Sorry ki-lings, I'll report this, their beauty is a crime
I am so familiar with these girls already and I like it. Thanks to their appearance in fact in star I got to know their personality. Also they have a very distinct and unique visuals. They're all very beautiful but I personally like that Yves' girlfriend Elly. She is very different on and off screen. Also I didn't expect this song will be this cool as the song name says. The start when doyeon starts her line it's already very cool 👍
I think I'm falling in love with these girls...
I LOVE IT. WEKIMEKI 1ST WIN LETS GO!!!!!
Ooo I think this might be my favorite so far
I'm so glad to be a kiling since the debut omgg
first win, please
Let’s get first win
Let's collect votes on StarPlay so they can get their first win!!!! Here's a tutorial of how to vote :) https://twitter.com/WEMEVotingTeam/status/1274503126448513025?s=19

AROHA here supporting Astro’s sisters. Such a COOL song! Love the outfits.  Wekimeki fighting!!!
AROHA here supporting Astro’s sisters. Such a COOL song! Love the outfits.  Wekimeki fighting!!!
Sólo paso por aquí preguntando donde están las fans latinas????
Who's that short haired girl? She look so cool just like the title. I came across this mv because of recommendation, I wish weki meki will have a great achievement with this song.
weki meki never made a bad song they slap us and take away our drink and we (clap)
oye ustedes no se aburren de sacar tan buena música?
Dang, I wasn't expecting much but this song is a banger. Kind of surprising I said that about Fromis 9 and Everglow's latest songs, too. Is 2020 the best year for Kpop or what.
크 갈수록 곡 퀄이 장난아니네요

I'm really sad that they still don't have their 1st winn!!! I hope we could give it to them this comeback
Giving loona so what

Weki Meki coming in with another comeback / song of the year contender!
PURE TALENT!!! OMG WHY THE HELL THEY GOT NO WIN???? ANYBODY KNOW WHAT HAPPEN???

The only songs that did not disappoint me in this month's release was from blackpink. Izone and weki has failed to get my love this month. I'm it even a crazy fan of K-pop. I just go by whatever gets my attention and interest.
Lua look so badass with that hair

Hi Nctzen here to check them out and WOW. These girls are amazing. The song itself is super catchy, the concept and the aesthetic is super pretty..... This feels so fresh. Not quite girl crush but not quite teen crush either. I would say this is like elegant-girl crush and I freaking adore this <3

yo i did not expect that this song will sound so COOL!!!?????? like literally
based off of the teaser, this wasn’t what i was expecting. but i loved this! how do we manage to get dazzle dazzle, oopsy AND this all in one year!?
THIS IS THEIR BEST COMEBACK IM TELLING YOU
❤🧡💛YES GIRLS YES!!!!💛🧡❤
THIS SONG MUST BOP
WEON, ESTOY ENAMORADA DE LUA. AYUDA POR FAVOR.
This is so good
Weki Meki is like that certain group in your campus you don't wanna mess with. They have that vibe that makes you wanna make way for them and you're be like.. standing on the side and just be looking at them while they pass by people. They don't hurt, they just make you feel like "Wow.. They really look so COOL."  (For me.. This song has a Picky Picky vibe on it. Actually even like a vibe of Crush and I Don't Like You Girlfriend.. Something like those 3 songs. And it feels like.. Wow this is so Weki Meki.)
WOWW I don't know what is the part that I liked more, maybe the outfits,  rap, choreography, o the video!!!!  Is so perfect everything.  Is a new concept that really stay with weki meki ♡♡♡♡
Damn WekiMeki getting lit again this comeback 🔥🔥🔥
gooodd
Wekimeki jjang!!
Yoojung is really cool.

Hello Weki Meki fans. I'm a multifandom but I'm not into them yet, so it would help a lot if you could tell me the members names and bios and other stuff.. I'm expecting a positive feedback from you Weki Meki fans..🙂.
WEKI MEKI IS 1ST WIN
This sound is new for Weki Meki compared to their previous songs.
Am I the only one in love with the chorus

🚨ATTENTION🚨 Hello viewers!  I'm just here to inform everyone the following about how YouTube's view count system works. You may have heard rumors: - that using emojis freezes the view count - that youtube purposely freezes views on kpop M/Vs  These are both entirely *FALSE*! Emojis do *NOT* freeze anything on YouTube because they are in no way associated with the actual view count system that YouTube uses to tally their views! Comments have absolutely *NO* effect on view counts as well.  YouTube also does *NOT* purposely freeze views for kpop M/Vs. When a video gets a massive amount of views in a short time span, it causes the server to lag and the view count freezes until it can catch up and tally all of the views.   Also, for the first *24 HOURS* any video is uploaded to YouTube, a filter is in place to not count repeat views in a short time span. They consider this similar to botting, so precautions are put in place to only count organic views for the first *24 HOURS*.  There is an easy way around this if you would like to have multiple views counted. Just make sure to watch other videos in between before returning to this M/V. You could make a Weki Meki playlist for example and throw in a few different M/Vs along with this one and let it cycle through each video. Your views will be counted then!  Happy viewing and please keep yourselves informed with accurate information!
Waohhhhh🤩🤩 🌟👏👏👏👏👊
Suyeon! Elly! Yoojung! Doyeon! Sei!Lua! Rina! Lucy! WEKIMEKI!

They're company should promote or invest on them ,they give them these gurls 3 comebacks in a year and didn't promote them,promoting in music shows aren't enough actually. The song is Good btw.!
liiiiiiiit
Weki Meki fighting ☺️
I might have to re listen to this next week. Right now I'm too blackpink biased to appreciate anything else. But is doyoung a chef concept in this? She serving looks for dessert
This is really COOL
when u see 1. fresh concepts 2. bomb ass choreography 3. quality 4. visuals you know it's weki meki.
issa bop
تجنن

This song is cool~
OML please perform sweet dreams too it's amazing!
i just wanna say       Choi Yoojung my bias
WOW
this is such a reversal from their previous concepts but JUST as good and exciting and beautiful and catchy and the choreography is exquisite and help i can't breathe
Okay but weki meki deserves 1st win with this comeback. Cool is literally a bop especially the rap parts. Stanning weki meki was the best decision.
기존의 노래 색들과는 다른데 또 다른 위키미키의 색을 볼 수있어서 좋아요 ㅎ
this line distribution tho!
Wow... This One is Fierce... Love the Style, Look, Attitude, Everything... Great Song and M/V... These Ladies Do Not Miss...
Support WEKI MEKI
if doyeon's first line doesn't go VIRAL then there is something wrong with this world
I really like this song. Am I the only one the bridge gives the same vibe as "Vogue" by Madonna!?
I hope they get their first win in this mv:(. They are so talented. How can they still haven't got their first win?!
omgg who's that person with a boyish haircut and green bangs????? T^T
This is in different vibes and still love it... But i need to watch it twice to see where is sei's part... its barely there..  I probably would watch this more.
I AM NOT DONE CRYING WTF
WTF I WASNT EXPECTING THIS, YOU GIRLS SNAPPED FR
Fantagio always kills it with the MV unlike others who copy each others.”everyday I just wanna dance”, cool!
ドヨンちゃん始まり私得すぎる本当に好き、そしてスタイル良すぎて震える、、🥺

Do like me
Boring song,  nothing valuable,  nothing memorable,  nothing enjoyable.
Ay ay ay ay
Damn Fantagio you keep on leveling up with your MVs starting with BINSAN Bad Idea now with Weki Meki's Cool now I'm starting to wonder what u have in store for Ong Seongwu? FANMU RICH
If you are here and reading this, CONGRATULATIONS you have just  witnessed the song of the year.
Cool
저에게 위키미키 팀는 유일하게 음방을 편하게 볼 수 있는 팀이 되었습니다.  짧은 의상이 없더라도 이렇게 멋진음악을 보여줄 수 있다는것 많은 소속사들이 배워갔으면 좋겠다는 생각이 듭니다.  성장형팀인거 같아요 노래도 컨셉도 의상도 다음이 기다려지는 팀입니다. 이번 노래 정말 좋네요. 사실 위키미키 의상때문에 관심을 갖게된 것도 있어요. 멋진의상으로 멋진 활동 해줘서 너무 고맙습니다. 하얀색 점프수트인가요? 최고네요.
WE ARE LACKING AT DIGITALS SO LET'S VOTE HARD ON PRE VOTING AND LIVE VOTING IN STARPLAY.
I just saw Doyeon and Yoojung in produce 101 when danced 'bang' I really miss ioi😔 I hope weki meki can last long. FIGHTING WEKI MEKI!!!
Bring it back
Ki-Lings are you even okay?  Lets get their first win.
Ay ay ay ay
It's true. Weki Meki have only served us bops since their debut. Especially with this year's three comebacks, this is my favorite. My Bias, Elly, slayed me in this video.
Cool

They all look amazing! But Lua looks really COOL.

Weki Meki is really trying to make me stan them this year... this is so good!! (Who is the one with the glass of wine, she could actually be my bias?!)

It's kinda so sad to see how the quality gets lower each comeback :( bc they are so underrated. stan weki meki periodt
اسم على مسمى  اغنية تووب
Voy a ser sincera, me gusta mucho las canciones de weki meki y las apoyo y todo eso pero sinceramente esta canción es una mierda, no me gustó para nada y el MV nada que ver.

The only reason they are not as popular as they should be is because they are not in big3. If they were their popularity would have been insane because they are talented beautiful and everything
Really wanna their first win!!
Freaking JESUS CHRIST.... this is amazing........
Lightstick pls!!!
The song was a bit of a miss for me personally, found it a little confusing at times hopefully will grow on me but don't think it'll be on repeat at any point sadly. A real shame, I've been following them since debut & am super glad that this mv has a much better budget or at least distribution of budget so it looks high quality while still being simple which is definitely a step up from their last two releases. Hope this can get a first win though, the girls deserve it even if its not my favourite release
Not a fan but this song’s is literally *COOL*
I'm not a Ki-Ling but this song is bop. This song deserves more attention as well as the group.
LUA REALLY MAKES ME CRAZY FOR ALL OF THEY COMEBACK THIS YEAR AAAAKH
Like Runway music with fashion
LUA’S VISUALS UGHHHH
THE MV WAS SO AMAZING
Weki meki literally lacks nothing!!! what did I say NOTHING!!!. they effortlessly amazing

SIMPLIST QUEENS
The music video is tasteful too, much better that the one for OOPSY. We're still talking of a relatively low budget one as the company is small and... Well Covid man... But they really get their money worth. The best shot is them on those pedistal dancing like they are statues, really cool.
Yawa this is what you call MV!!!!! EVERYTHING IS FUCKING PERFECT.
Do like me
I didn't stan them actually but this song really 6
QUÉ HERMOSAS 💞✨

Wait I'm confused, which is the chorus part 🤣
OMG i loveeeeeeee this song sooooooooo much, good job wekimeki god job fantagio
Choreography 💖
is realy coool  WEKY MEKI go to up up 😍😊
Even though they don't have the greatest sets or budget, I'm still glad Fantagio is going all out to promote Weki Meki despite them being heavily underrated. Unlike other companies who don't promote their groups well like Jellyfish Ent. & MBK Ent.   Not to mention, 3 comebacks in a year? DAZZLE DAZZLE, OOPSY and COOL are all bops. Hands down.   #WEKIMEKI1STWIN #COOL1STWIN
MATURE LEGENDS COME THROUGH
COOOOOOOL
Cool
Nice concept
GDJDJKG
I’M GAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ah
WEKIMEKI NEVER MADE A BAD SONGG

2:19 Masterpiece! How incredible!!!
nice song! aroha here supporting weki meki and ki-lings...fighting ki-lings!
So coooool!!
weki meki world domination
I still wait them to blow up
All these make me love the MV - Doyeon outfit 1:52 - Yoojung part at 1:55 - Lucy rap part. - Rina look(lol it inspire me) 1:09 - Suyeon all center part.  - Sei cute voice and her visual in red dress. - Lua short green hair (yess) - Elly part, the one she lies with another member. - Everyone have a chance to shine in this MV(Each member has enough line and screentime too). - The song... not really. But it still a good one.  And the most important        *THAT IS THIS MV HAS WEKI MEKI*
i'm ready to stan after this. the member with green in her hair-
Choreography..... Looking great.......!!!!
I love the short hair! 💗
Okay guys, let's work hard to get 1st win. They must have 1st win this comeback!

いいよがんばろうな
LUA HAIR THO OMG SHE KILLIN IT

This choreo is like the combination of many kpop groups choreo. Feel familiar. But it is normal in kpop as sometimes the choreographer is the same person. Also Slay
LUAAA WHY YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME
Cool
They really are cool and obviously the coolest period don't make a fuss
I like these gigls but this song was  bit too bland for me

Not a fan but this song is lit  bop indeed
aesthetic 💯
Doyeonnn 💙💙
Im crazy
The opening I am DECEASED
Song like this will sound amazing on runway (especially the instrumental)
When I tell you I had my mouth open the entire time lol it dropped on the first beat and all I did was try not to blink while saying "oh my god" over and over inside my head and grabbing my hair like an idiot. Seriously, "cool" is an understatement, I don't know what word would best describe this song, the music video, the girls, their voices, everything, but I feel like "cool" is not even close to enough. I wasn't expecting this at all, I'm flabbergasted.
*This is soooo COOL!*
Rina so pretty. This really!!!
Please give them their win.  They are so exhausted by releasing 3 albums a year.  We can atleast give them their win and make them happy.
make sure to check the other mv in the 1thek channel, the vi ws there also count to music shows wins
This is a certified club banger!
LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH

노래도 좋고 컨셉도 괜찮은데 스타일링 뭔가 개아쉬움.. 톤그로 보는 느낌 같달까.. 간지 나는 컨셉에 코디랑 메컵 이게 최선...?
2:20 SO YOOJUNG REALLY DID THIS CHOREOGRAPHY OMG WE STAN

Imagine hating on them because you are envious that they won one award Imagine being that dumb
Weki Meki aren’t just artists, they’re a lifestyle, a reason to breathe, an escape from this cruel world filled with thieves. They’re art, the first gift you open on christmas, a hug from a loved one, everything you’ve ever wanted, everything you need.
THIS SONG DESERVE TO WIN ON MUSIC CHARTS

This was really good! Great energy through the song!  What a year! Oopsy I like better than Dazzel Dazzle, and I like this better than Oopsy! Ok, early reactions still, bit it have a really good vibe to it, and they all look so insanely awesome and confident! Great comback!
도입부 김도연은 언제나 옳다 존나 잘생겨서 심장 멎을뻔
i will donate beds to everyone so y’all can stop sleeping on Weki Meki
this song is so addictive im so excited to learn the choreo
SOTY MATERIAL
kiling please keep stream¡ng
Ta perfeitooooo
The styling is really good, tho I'm not sure about the song but I am looking forward to their bsides since I love their previous releases. Too much going on with the music.  Anyways, I really like Lua's hair here. She looks so good and Suyeon is getting prettier every comeback. I don't know who's my bias anymore.
Love the implication on 1:48 that Doyeon is our lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Also this song is 3 1/2 minutes but feels like a 15-minute extended remix for a sweaty goth club
Lendariass
Believe it or not, Weki Meki went from hating your girlfriend to being cooler than her.
Doyeon unniiee!!!!
the true hidden diamond of k-pop
Looks, set , vocals,raps , beat, song totally good.
1:55 yoojung look like chung ha with this hair style and outfit ♥ ♥ they are beautiful and alway have a good mv , i stan them ♥♥♥
LUA IS STUNNING
Ki-Ling let’s get a win for this comeback!!
The fact that they're more handsome, swaeg, and cool than some other boy groups out there.

Not the girl crush kinda vibe but that bad bitch vibe like that don't mess with me vibe, it's something like those girls who joined all the Rap survival programmes kinda thing vibe.  .

HOLY SHNOOKERDOOKIES 😱 Fist listen thoughts... HELL YES, I love all the sections of the song, I love the raps, how   it gives a highlight to each member (well a bit less from Lua, Rina and Sei but they shine on their parts) the song has so many layers, is intriguing, I already want to listen again ❤️ The video is gorgeous, I can notice a little more budget and quality, also the angles are perfect. Kinda regretting only getting one version of the album but I praying for a first win, please 🙏🙏🙏

ARTEEE • comeback de alto calibre ❤️❤️❤️❤️ AMO AMO AMO
Long time KiLing here...this song isn't doing it for me. Who wrote this? There is no discernable verse, chorus. It's just a confusing song to follow.
i got this on my recommendation page and i only had been released for 21 minutes so why not watch it   and i never really heard a song of weki meki i only know it was a girl group   but i was such a great song i really liked it   i’m more of a boy group kpop fan but i’m starting to like girl groups too
How can released 3 comebacks in one year and get better with every released? They Really deserve the world :c but the World not deserve they!!
RINA LOOKS SO GOOD IM SCREAMING
this is INCREDIBLY COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
I love it!!!! And Seiii 😍😍💕

AHHHHHHHHHH COOOOL♥️♥️
I like this sound more for Weki Meki!! They sound more unified imo~
OK. THIS IS SOOOO😭😭
This is how you do an MV on a somewhat low budget during a pandemic. Lookin at you Cube with that CLC comeback we just had. As far as Weki Meki, LOVE this MV, the styling, the cinematography, lighting, etc. THE GIRLS LOOK STUNNING. As far as the song it didn't hit me first time, second time is better, there is a lot going on in it but its a good/new direction for WM and I hope this comeback brings them some success
I LIKE IT SO MUCH 😭💖
LUA ĐỈNH!!!!!!!
WOWWWW, this song is the BEST. Weki Meki world domination!!!
عجبتني بالتوفيق

This is a good song and music video by Weki Meki. It's my least favorite of their title tracks, to be honest, but their weakest title track is better than the best title track from some groups. Hopefully it will grow on me. I'm used to falling in love with their songs instantly. I do love this cool group. They are one of my favorites.
#Weki Meki.Ji Suyeon. Elly. Choi Yoojung. Doyeon. Sei. Lua. Rina. NohLucy😍😘❤❤❤❤❤
