Here because of Sesskasays
I love this! Thanks for making this video.
Well that was definitely an interesting promo idea fto sell the nww box set. One problem there's no way in hell Tegan could possibly know of the female doctor. That was a political decision to include the new series with the classic series.
Since When "Sarah Sutton" Got Older, For The Past Few Years 😮😮😮
I so want to see the Road Trip drama between these 3.  I can see their characters complain in just the same way.  LOL
Oh how I wish this was part of the 60th full length special/ specials
Nyssa is the shows most underrated companion, IMHO. I would really have enjoyed Five and Nyssa having adventures together. Writers could have done so much with the character but it felt as though she spent more time on the sidelines than actually taking part in the main storyline. Shame. Her gentile but intelligent demeanour really suits the Davison Doctor.  I cant lie though. Part of my rationale is that Sarah is such a delightful person. I really enjoy seeing her on Behind The Sofa. I do like Tegan as well, but she did tend to overpower things.
This was dumb.
Worst companion of all time
I was half hoping it was not Nyssa, but Ann's granddaughter
We really need the Mara revisited
The Brigadier and of course, the master, the black guardian,
I knew it I knew it. I knew it wasn’t over yet. Oh my gosh I am having goosebumps and I feel like back in the day when me and my great grandfather would watch Doctor Who and go on these journeys a classic Doctor Who legendary Doctor Who beautiful thank you to my grandfather and thank you to the legendary Doctor Who from one to seven and all the companions. I’m just over the it was very beautiful and awesome.💯💯💯💯💯💙💙💙💙💙💙
Ooo no
Please. Somebody can bring her and Ace back? Not that I'm bored of only seeing Mel but what happened to them?
The Lucy and Peppermint Patty of space. Glad to see Tegan and Nyssa reunited. Had mad crushes on both of them, especially when Sarah dropped that skirt in Terminus❤❤. But The Mara gave me the chills, they need to bring The Mara back.
And Janet is still the best ever actress at doing what I call "possessed" acting. She should be a villain in a horror movie, she'd be absolutely chilling.
8:56 "its worth quite a bit of money!" "is it?" very in-character
My gosh Sarah was hot back in the day.
Can’t believe this was filmed at adventure island I live 5 mins away 😭
Poor Tegan. She’ll never be free of the Mara
Nope he still hasn’t learn how to fly the tardis and he never will
Nyssa is bloody gorgeous still!!!! I always has such a crush on Tegan too!!!! 😍
Hey! Don't leave Tegan in peril like that.
6:38 to 7:12 - 😆😆😆
Excellent! I knew the Mara wasn’t dead! Really wonderfully made!
I MISS THE FIRST THREE DOCTORS REST IN TIME
I miss Anthony ainley rhe third   master 8:59
THE MASTER
This takes place before the Memory Tardis stories. But even so, within this short story video, it would be nice to do a memory Tardis about Adrik and the two friends away from an adventure. Basically, it's a story that takes place within a few hours. Where all retells a story of their childhood which each unknowingly has a connection. About a secret they each have from a different point of view. This is set before Adriks death.
In it's own way Dr Who taught us about the aspirations of its creators and what people can aspire to become.  Peter Davison became a better Doctor as he aged, btw.
I need the Mara to return and it must start with Teagan in trouble, Nyssa somehow finding out and sending a message to The Doctor “Teagan Mara, Help Doctor, Nyssa” and then boom opening theme, I will lose my mind 😂
I wish I knew how lucky I was? Tegan had one of the more rational reasons for leaving and perhaps the truest to character
4:00 is that a statue of Sutehk behind Teagan?
Why do I get the impression that this version of the Mara is going to return in new who like sutekh did but not as in Peter Davidson time the new Dr who series I maybe wrong.
Nyssa hasn't changed
Gosh its lovely to see Tegan, I so loved her character she was the best!
I work with a girl called Nyssa. I asked her if she had a brother called Adric or a sister called Tegan. She asked me how I knew her parents scheme for naming their kids, though she clearly knew. She said she knew all about Nyssa being a princess. She didn't know that Nyssa was also the best Chemist in the known universe. She kind liked hearing this as we work in Nuclear Medicine, and Chemistry is a big chunk of what we do.
"Clyde chatted with a nice couple from Australia, Tegan and Nyssa."
Wait I need to know what happens has big finish done this yet???? Ahhh
I love Nyssa and Tegan so much
SEEING THEM TOGETHER IS A DREAM COME TRUE.
I love how they snuck in Sutek the Destroyer in the background right before Tegan goes into the box.
"Waking or dreaming you cannot escape me" The Mara taking cues from the Black Guardian I see.
I’m so glad that, many months later, I’ve finally been able to order this from little NZ. This trailer has really hyped me up for its arrival!
They sound like they did all those years ago. And Tegan learning to fly sounds so right for her.  That road trip looks funny.
❤
It's sad to see these old people dragged out of retirement for these lame skits. Nice try though.
I know some people are fond of it. But i think that Celery is bloody stupid. It annoys me every time i see it 😂
Ahhh I've watched all their episodes so many times, listened to nearly all the audio dramas featuring them, it's a massive treat to have this in the world 💜😊
Nyssa shines more in the audio dramas.  In the tv series she was always stuck in the Tardis for several episodes!  Poor thing.
On my list to get. Get season 21 in the works as well. Also finish the Tom Baker seasons as well.
I was so in love with Tegan in the 80's. It was such a joy to hear our beautiful Aussie accent alongside the Doctor! I have been a Whovian since I was a child in the 60's; I do hope this wonderful television continues for another 50 years. Not that I will be in this dimension in 50 years!
Oh man! This was a gutpunch!  The Mara scared the crap out of me when I was a kid, despite it being a big rubbery snake. I think there is something truly terrifying about a monster that gets inside you and posseses you. You can't run from it, you can't fight it, it's already inside you.  The idea that something can get inside you and make you hurt your loved ones, or turn your loved ones against you is one I find most disquieting. I suppose such monsters could be seen as a metaphor for addiction or mental illness. That certainly tracks as Tegan is still battling the Mara all these years later.  One can't pull mental illness out of you, you have to live with it, battle it constantly.
She sounds so very aussie when she talks about pilot's licence :P
3:55 I’ve watched this three times now, and only just caught the Sutekh reference in the background!
If the BBC had any sense, they would start a reality show with as many classic DW actors as they could get to agree to do it 😁
I love how all of Patrick Troughton’s returns to doctor who got the Blu Ray treatment before any of his actual time as the doctor did
😮ANYONE NOTICE SUTEKH STATUE TO THE LEFT OF THE TARDIS AS TEGAN ENTERS😊
My favorite Doctor and my favorite companion reunited! This is truly great!!
We haven’t seen much of mark strickson
THE MARA
I just watched Kinda the other day so excuse me while my head explodes!
These trailers are every bit as good as actual Doctor Who at this point 👀
Next week on: Old people need a pension top up
"Scarf or celery? Or woman!" And the 60th Anniversary's line "Then I wore a bowtie, then I was a Scotsman, then I was a woman."  Every time 13th is just "a woman" it makes whatever the other descriptions into a "ah yes the 3 genders" joke. Which I am here for😂😂😂😂
Why are these trailers so much better than the last few years of Doctor Who?
Although I love the remastering, modern CGI looks weird & out of place in Classic Who.
Why amuses me is that they can save Nyssa and not make a pit stop on a crashing Freighter to save Adric?
Chilling
These short films should be made available as standalone minisodes without the trailer segments.
Please make this a full episode!!
we need more of these
This is amazing
All of this "he" and "him" nonsense, the Doctor is a "They/them" now. Bloody BBC can't even keep up.
So Nyssa isn't really real when Tegan saw her.
I didn't care for Tegan at the time, but grew to appreciate her. I had a crush on Nyssa back then, however...
turlough !!!!
Wow. This is one of those things where I have to check a calendar and count the years. It's been over 40 years. Seeing these actors reunited as old people is shocking and also very enchanting. Everybody's now an old grandparent.  "And it'll happen to you!" - Grandpa Simpson
God, I feel so old now...   ;-P
Now we need season 21
When I saw Nyssa again I began to cry... she was my first and is still my greatest celebrity crush! Losing her at Terminus broke my heart.... God, it's good to see her again!
I love how we have a THIRD version of The Five Doctors now. This really does seem like these sets are getting bigger and bigger in scale.
OMG so good to see Mark Strickson... I had the biggest crush on Turlough  :)
This was so cool.... always loved Janet Fielding, Tegan was like Donna 1.0 :)
Sarah looks even more beautiful now than she did then.
They could make a full movie length story of the Europe road trip
Kinda was well made.
Omg. Gay ppl real
Serial Doctor Who 💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭 .
I just don't think an older Tegan would have her hair in that 100% Janet Fielding austere, cropped bob.
That was NOT TEIGAN! SHe was HOT with great legs! I am not so damn old! Nor is she!
I'm glad this is coming but as a long, long time fan of classic I have to say I'm disappointed at the price point.  Loads of people are struggling with cost of living and it's really disappointing to see the price going beyond £50. I get it, they're nice sets and we're getting a whole season while the DVDs used to be over £10 each back in the day, but you should have done Classic fans a solid and kept the release price the same as the previous collections.
Now this is real Dr Who
Janet fielding is so beautiful and great to see again
Was so upset when I came back from my holiday, and my boss told me Dr Who was filming here. I would’ve done over time just to watch this 😂
I started withering away when the interviewee starting going off about feminism (that's pretty much all the last 10 years of Who have been). But then the shots from the classic show made me feel alive again.
My absolute favorite season!  I was 12 when it came out, so I was pretty into DW at the time.
Awesome, can’t wait for this to come out! congratulations to the team for putting together such a fantastic BoxSet with genuinely valuable special features
Filmed in adventure island southend on sea my home city ❤
Hahaha looks like they had more fun with Peter than with Tom.  Grant you I still loved Tom as the Doctor, but some episodes with Peter was exciting
The "A little older" and "Don't start me" lines kind of make me sad since Adric didn't get the chance to grow older.
"Waking or sleeping...." - suddenly reminds me of the Black Guardian with Turlough
Super excited for this as well.  Early 80s Who has long been my favorite since it's when I first watched the show.  The airings on PBS in the US had caused the fan base to grow exponentially by then, and conventions were popular (attended many in Philly back then).  Truly a golden age.  Love the 5th Doctor, and what a great TARDIS crew that was.  Watching this trailer is definitely an emotional experience.
Delighted to see Sarah Sutton back as Nyssa ... she was a favourite of mine "back in the day" , and she still looks STUNNING!!  Apparently, the "fairground" scenes were shot at Adventure Island, on the seafront at Southend-on=Sea, Essex.
Time to part with some money for this. I think it's a good investment. My era of Dr who.
🤘🎥🤘 #whovian
These little mini-movie things are always a delight. And I love the Timescoop being that black obelisk thing!
His best season
I do wonder with these boxsets if Janet's old agent status comes out, and she now Sarah's, notice they in nearly every boxset some how lol
I could not watch last season, since it was on HBO Max, not BBCAnerica. I hate streaming services. I'm not paying $12.99 a month, for HBO Max, by the way.
That was epic! These trailers really do deserve to be considered canon mini-episodes. I'd love to see this plot thread continued in an actual episode, with Tegan defeating the Mara once and for all.   I'm so psyched for this box set - Season 20 is a perfect choice for the 60th anniversary year. That road trip and the new version of The Five Doctors will be the highlights for me.
I appreciate how you actually explained how Nyssa got to earth rather than Mel just appearing out of nowhere in that awful Power of The Doctor thing
Always loved Snakedance...and Arc Of Infinity, which puts me in the minority.  When everyone else laughed at the giant plucked space chicken, I was scared out of my wits.  (I was, in my own defence, eight years old at the time.)  DW was actually quite poetic and weird much of the time from 1980-83, then....something was lost that it never got back again.
Absolutely loved the mini-sode, would love to see more but why do all the box sets have to be blu-ray 😭😭
I have never wanted something so badly but unfortunately I don't have a blu-ray dvd player 😭😭
this was awesome! just one more to add to the collection.
Will this be available for purchase in Canada? I really need this!
I love it! It's got a touch of DT and dash of MS! Love it!!!
Does the box set come with a hot water bottle and a blanket?
It was good to see Tegan again. I had big crush on her while when she was with the Doctor. LOL
They really need to do a brand new Mara story - long overdue
I love the Mara!
I hated this intro and ending when I was a kid, because I knew instantly it was either the end of Tom Baker or wasn't Tom Baker at all. Now, seeing this, I cry with happiness to see Tegan and Nyssa again. Time flies.
I'd get it for the road trip shennanigans footage. Looks they were having a laugh.
Why im gonna get this: 7:10
Looks magnificent, can't wait for the box set. I refuse to believe 40 years have passed since I first saw this though, that's just not possible 😄.
i fell in love with nyssa all over again..just wonderful
This was amazing 👏
God they're old! Tegan was always a crap companion anyway.
The level of amateurism on the intro movie is epic! I had to check this wasn't a fan made film, oh dear its so bad, this was a cringe fest, especially the snake hahahaha both the transfer tattoo and the 90s CG one. I do think the interviews with past cast and all the reminiscing will be awesome though.
I would have never known it was Tegan, I know it's been 40 years but  It looks like someone else, Nyssa still looks gorgeous.
Don’t care.
I was age 9 to 12 when Peter Davison was the Doctor. Great to see Tegan and Nyssa again who were also with Tom Baker. Stopped watching after Peter Capaldi. I'd long to have that magic back again like when I was a kid!
hell yes
I'd LOVE to see the doctor return to E-Space and pick up Romana and K-9
The past always comes a knocking for those who were travelling in time and space a blast from Tegans  past on multiple occasions a seed that never truly leaves its hidden in the deepest part of time especially for those who think their safe and far and away from the touch of evil a mind shattering nightmare from the shadows of a good companions soul this story never got a sense it truly was over a tattoo a classic chiller a very dark void that still has a modern story with ancient tales of terror and monster that can shape shift into the skin of a familiar face or possibly enter the dreams of others a true skin walker from the universe of the unknown? A brilliant opening scene a reuniting two old friends on the surface till entering the tardis a walnut of a cliff hunger a classic Doctor Who! The only one who is missing is Adrik of which is quite possibly there who knows?  Yeti will also have make a reappearance, and classic foes like the Giant Robot and Boss?
I always hated the way they wrote the character Teagan. They made her a whiny panicky person. It was lazy. She could have been more back then. Nissa was awesome.
This is a rotten bit of deception.  Nothing interesting but a sales pitch to purchase DVD's . . . C'mon do better.
Good to see tegan and nyssa again after all these years
Hi all can you help does this mean she is the corsair?
9:09 the two doctors! 😁
My first and favorite opening theme! Great mini episode liked the Teagan and Nyssa reunion
Wait... The Brits said Season. Not Series.
Isn't there any way we can get these cool box sets in America and to play an American machines without having to buy another player? Just for that, don't we have anything even close to this? And why is it only available in Europe? It seems a little unfair. If I'm wrong I'm wrong but if there is a way to get these in America, please provide a link. Thank you
7:36 Would have been nice if Ian Collier were still alive.
“ we’re here 1983 “   “ the perfect choice “   “ I’m not coming with you What “   “ Oh my dear Doctor you have been naive “   “ goodness me so there are five of me now “   “ oh dear “   “ we could be playing the game of Rassilon at this very moment “   “ Exterminate! “   “ we’re not on a yacht we’re on a spaceship “   “ ahhhh “   “ now what do you think of it so far “   “ keep it going “   “ this friend of yours is it by any chance the Doctor “   “ Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart “   “ that boy “   “ kill the Doctor “
Nyssa I liked oh the other hand Janet Fielding aka never rubbed me right does everyone know the story of how Tegan Jovanka came to be??
I literally cried with joy seeing this!!! ❤
Can be pre-ordered from Amazon UK but they give a release date of 31st December 2025! Surely some mistake? Almost two and a half years and just AFTER Christmas? When it would make an ideal Christmas present if released before.
So it appears Tegan isnt a one off in Power of the Doctor and she is stepping up for Sarah Jane Smith under RTD's 2nd rotation around the Whoniverse.  Nice.
So I loved the Tegan/Nyssa reunion - real true joy. And I was enjoying the trailer but thinking - lovely, but I'm not gonna buy it. There's too much to watch and not enough money to spe- AND THEN they threw in a 40th anniversary edition of the Five Doctors and I have NO CHOICE!
I love these mini-episodes and absolutely LOVE seeing the original companions return for these.  These are priceless.  Ever since Elisabeth Sladen returned as Sarah Jane, it has been great to see other classic companions return in the regular series and in these mini-episodes.  This is what makes Doctor Who so great and timeless!
Can I just say that those Main Title Credits and music held up incredibly well?
Just a shame adric can’t be here…
I always thought Tegan was never truly free of the Mara.Brilliant mini episode and trailer.
I've never wanted to buy a set more, purely for the extras alone!
Enjoyed that 👌 😊
If only post 2017 Who was as exciting?
Doctor Who has 2 hearts that’s why he/she can’t die I remember when I was young learning this and thinking why not shoot him twice like double tap then all this nonsense would been gone forever.
Why is this Blu Ray trailer genuinely terrifying?
Why is this Blu Ray trailer genuinely terrifying?
Yes those were the days when each doctor was better then the last. You have to admit the role was built for tom baker. To actually fill tom's shoes and then carryon up is no small feat, but after being known to everyone as tistan farnham was a transformation itself.
Why would all the lights be on at a closed amusement park?. do they give electricity away for free now in the United Kingdom?
Ok, I've thought a Mara return as been possible ever since I saw "Snake Dance" in the 1980s.  So I hope this is really happening next season!
Not much more I can say that wasn't already said here. That was fantastic. I was wondering when they would so another Davidson series, as he only has three. I look forward to this season 20 and hopefully season 21 in a few years, then I can dump all my old VHS tapes. LOL
I love these announcement videos. They keep getting better and better.
🎉😮❤😊
Is that the Mara?
Finally, S20 is on the way after it was known to be in the pipeline for literal years.  Underrated season. Love Enlightenment in particular.
vision or not, it was nice seeing these two characters reunited.
Glad to hear there's some new optional special effects for this 👍 The last two collection releases were sorely lacking in that respect but at least there's some available again this time. Looking forward to this release.
Absolutely brilliant! 👏👏👏
Nyssa...?  To quote Philip J Fry - "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
God, that TARDIS looks like absolute ASS! Did the prop warehouse burn down or something.
"Back in your box." Talk about a not-so-friendly reminder that Tegan's time in the Tardis was rougher than most...  I would genuinely be so overjoyed if we got an episode of the new series about the Mara being expelled forever.
"Doctor-Lite" coming to trailers now?
These trailers are becoming episodes in their own right. Love it.
Tegan reuniting with Adric -- now _that_ would be a surprise.
Updated special effects which will look dated in a few years. Just leave the original stuff alone.  OTOH, Blakes 7 could use some less dodgy miniatures shots.   ps: the 12 year old boy in me cannot handle Tegan and Nyssa getting older.
What a brilliant trailer. I love the idea of the Mara haunting Tegan after all this time! Such a clever and spooky idea. Seeing Nyssa again was great. I can't wait for the European trip with Peter, Janet and Sarah. It looks hilarious. This may be my favourite of the book sets ❤ The Fifth Doctor has always been underrated in my opinion and a favourite of mine
As a teen I had a crush on Tegan/Janet. I still do. She is still lovely. ❤
This is amazing, but why oh why would you remaster it??? What the hell was wrong with the flying ships in Enlightenment?? The simple, but effective, triangle in the Five Doctors?? Huh????
How does Sarah remain so beautiful after all these years???
Wonderful trailer. Superb. P.s- I love how the most grumpy classic Dr is the 5th!! 😂
"Scarf, celery...or woman?"  Love that this takes place after Power of the Doctor.
Tristan was always my 2nd favorite Dr.
Matthew Sweet is collecting Doctor Who stars like wild Pokémon.
Prue. Joy.
Doctor Who: The Fifth Doctor Viewer’s Guide has been published just a few weeks ago on Amazon and is a positive, enthusiastic and passionate analysis of seasons 19, 20, and 21.  Just thought I’d share. Viva the Fifth Doctor!
Okay okay I was on the fence about buying these new box sets since I already have most of the dvds, but this got me pretty excited
YES!!!
Meh. They ruined it after Peter Capaldi, now it seems like they are going to refurbish stuff.
AHHHH ....GOOD PerformanCE at the end! (great delivery)
The Doctor was or never could be a lady. It has destroyed the franchise.
Who is this? Yes!
I wasn't expecting this to be set after Power of the Doctor, that was a lovely surprise.
Between this and the companions anonymous meeting from the end of Power Of The Doctor, it looks like the Nyssa/Tegan ship that was set up in Farewell Sarah Jane Smith is just going to be quietly ignored from now on.
I like how the TARDIS door says pull to open but you push to open.
Was that Mark Strickson they met up with later?
Wait they redid the five doctors funny triangle vfx again?
Josh Snares gonna be overjoyed
oooh   who would wouldn't want a Mara episode in the modern series, with Tegan?
This is bugging me,of the 4 figure's in the background in behind the Sofa, from right to left, definitely omega, mawdryn,I 🤔 think it's a character from snakedance,help please anyone and iam pretty much sure the last one is the master,I think the only other time, Martin Clunes has talked about doctor who, was in 1994 when snakedance was being released on video, I can't remember what he said, but it was published in the tv zone magazine, does anybody remember that magazine?
Oh My GAWD!!! This was fantastic!!! I was absolutely enthralled from start to finish!!! The absolute best of the wonderful little visits with old and dear friends!!! Absolutely love these keep ‘em coming and how about continuing them…especially this one, I must know what happens!!! I love Tegan and Nyssa!!!
Quite lovely really.
The 5th Doctor and his bitchy companions hit the road! 😂 That alone is worth the price of admission.
Nyssa: Hello Tegan! Me: 😊
Any relation to colony saff
🌈Tegan and Nyssa 🌈 It's canon
For me without doubt the best theme they ever done for Doctor Who . Shame we didn't get the full extended version at the end .Goosebumps.
I remember meeting Peter back in I think 2017/2018 at Niagara Falls comic con and he was a very friendly person.
Bring back Adric!
Wow brilliant. Sarah Sutton is still OMG stunning :) I was in studio for the day when Ep 1 of 'Mawdryn Undead' was being filmed. A wonderful memory even to this day.
i like when she said.....scarf ....celery....or woman?
Never knew how much I wanted to see Tegan possessed by the Mara again! Janet Fielding's best performance yet as the Mara. Also loved the 80s theme, title sequence, and credits.
*inhales*  LESBIANS 🎉
Seriously was any other season in contention for this?
Ahhhh Nyssa! Such fantastic memories
Why'd the Mara have to do my girl like that 😭
Best trailer yet!   The Mara would be a welcome change from the over use of Daleks and Cybermen.  I was Kinda hoping that they'd have the Doctor possessed by a Mara, as a season arc, and the companions had no choice but to turn to the Master for help!   Ah,  we can only dream on....
Did they remake the Five Doctors AGAIN?  That capturing thing looks different again!
What was the name of the boy who was really good at puzzles who died in one of the Peter Davison episodes? Was it Oric or something?
Sarah sutton ❤❤❤
Nyssa was my favorite companion of Five! ❤
You got the credits wrong its ADVENTURE ISLAND not Adventureland 😂
Better than the whole of the chibnall era in 13 minutes
Wombat!
My favorite title sequence and theme song! Looks like an amazing box set.
Never mind the blue box OMG I want that blue kitchen!!!!!
Really good trailer. I do hope Nyssa is brought back for real though one day.
I like the idea of the Mara forever being trapped in Tegan's mind, ultimately powerless.
well whatever happened to just having short promo trailers for these box sets?  that's 10 minutes of my life I won't get back  :(
I knew it was the Mara! Boy, Do I EVER love the Kinda/Snakedance storyline! I can`t wait to get it! One question: Is it region 1 or 2???
wow, seeing this amidst the era of streaming services removing original content mere weeks after its debut is really something special. the shows/films of today will never receive this kind of care and treatment. all these preserved, restored episodes plus bonus content and new editions… a dream many fans of todays media will never be able to consume.
Gonna have to agree, some of the appearances of classic Who characters in Nu Who, plus these little mini-sodes really convince me that it merits having a vehicle to make it more regular.  This little glimpse of Teagan and Nyssa, with Peter's old opening sequence really make me want to see the rest of this episode, not just a mini that never resolves.  The idea that the Doctor might find out how bad Teagan's state becomes as the Mara takes over, and ACTUALLY go and get Nyssa to help Teagan find her way back through her memories to reach reality and defeat the Mara.  What if the CURRENT Doctor can find a way to reconnect with the personality and appearance of Teagan's Doctor to help her, allowing Peter to guest (as both he and Sylvester did with Jodie)?  In another of these promo minis, Ace was shown to be around doing something and we've seen the companions connecting and networking....DO SOMETHING WITH IT, PLEASE.  Give it a vehicle.  Even to follow up with a tie-in to some sort of Big Finish project would be really worthwhile and welcome.
So so so good. Thank you so much for making this.
err i thought they were canonically dating..
just on the roadtrip i was sold... why aren't these teasers for the new season - side characters who tell their stories in side projects, and pop in to the new narrative to announce they are canon in an appropriate story way. just write it good.
One to get for the extras alone, although will fill a few gaps lol.
We got older too! I went to collage in 1986 and stopped watching Doctor Who  until 2005 when I "retired," Now I'm just OLD. 😂
Hey BBC! Release 'Torchwood: Absent Friends'
Brilliant video 😃.
brings back memories so much childhood that time doctors
Still waiting for standard edditions of half of these.
Masterful!
Probably the best 80s season.
Love Season 20, criminally underrated season and I appreciate all the hard work the restoration team are putting into these sets. However I’ve got to point out what a lot of fans must be thinking. Why the studded price increase? When season 22 came out little over a year ago it was still £44.99 then season 2 and 9 crept up to £49.99 and now the asking price is £54.99 which is a 22% price increase in one year. Personally I think this is milking it a bit, I know inflation has increased lately but not to that extent. Not everyone can afford £54.99 especially those of us who own the stories on DVD, we’re really only buying these sets for the new extras, it’s sad to see. Think I’ll wait for the standard edition release.
Great to see this, especially with the seriously long wait till November.   Love the twist as to the real passenger, the Mara never left Tegan. . though great to see Nyssa.  More of these shorts please
I hope this includes Pertwee saying "sh**" from the 5 Doctors outtakes.
I wish I had realised how lucky I was, when my aunt was randomly murdered, and my new friend's whole world was destroyed along with 1/3 of the universe. No it does not rationally work. DW has always let that peak of the Master's crimes pass by too offensively glibly
Let me find out it's llamara
Love Doctor who I'm glad there going back to basics
Awesome Job @Pete!McTighe !!  Great to see this season finally announced. Also can we please finally have the Official VHS Art credited in the booklets in the same way the novelizations are? It's quite unfair on many Artists who created Cover Artworks 30 years ago and are omitted from the documented history?
And of course only the UK gets this 😢 What about the US??
Whoooooo! I was born on the airing date of the last episode of *Arc of Infinty.* Tegan has always been my favorite companion. Love this!
great job this is canon for me
Tegan was my first companion and Davison was my Doctor.
Can we PLEASE have a one-off, or a series of shorts, reuniting Tegan, Nyssa & the 5th Doctor? Pretty please!?!?!?!
For you younger people, Reagan as a companion user to complain at least twice an episode that She wanted to go home!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! iconic, legendary, thrilling, amazing, showstopping! Can't wait!
Finally......Doctor Who I actually want to watch. Love love love the title song and clip. God I miss those days.
This is just the right time for it released because we have got the 60th anniversary this for doctor who
Josh Snares will be happy as this is more Nyssa.
god that snake ooooh boy that was bad
I love how Tegan and Nyssa reunited back again and then see the Mara back too, I'm just like what no not the Mara
oh Nyssa has been my fav classic companion, and I'm so glad to see her back on Earth, and I love that she barely looks different
TAKE MY MONEY TAKE MY MONEY TAKE MONEY
This was Fantastic! A small reunion between Tegan and Nyssa (even if it might have been a trick from the Mara), and Peter, Sarah, and Janet's little field trip is just so amazing! I'm waiting till it's available now!
This was shockingly good. I hope we get more of these low budget shorts. So much story with little flags and bang
3:10 - Did they have to mention her?
Just a thought, when they do these for Season 7 and 11, they should bring back John Levene as Benton, and have him talk about the Brigadier and Liz to, say, Kate for the former, and about Sarah Jane to her friends for the latter.
Try not to cry! ♥ Uhh.. can't wait for the new Doc' :D
I know this might be classified information, but what is the scheduled release date? Not FOMO, but I'd like to know how long I have to save up to buy it.
This is so AWESOME ‼️
Now that’s a return to Doctor Who that I’ve been waiting for for 40 years. And I don’t mean Nyssa. Tiffany I don’t see Ncuti Gatwa looking for the stillpoint in 2024, I will be disappointed…
¡Wey no! ¡¿Qué pasó después?! D:!!!!  EDIT: Oh sorry, now i know, but still, i love these mini-episodes!
This was awesome!!!!
Uh, amazon & zaavi say the estimated release is dec 31st 2025? So what in two years or so? 😬😬😬😬 That's a loooooong wait.
I'm _very_ excited to see the 40th Anniversary Edition of _The Five Doctors,_ I'd been hoping for a new version since the Blu-Ray range began and I can't wait to see what surprises wait in store.  Love the new obelisk effect!
Looove watchin these. :D
Great stuff
Who played the Mara woman/passenger?  I didn't recognize her
nice to see the cover art is back on form
WAKE UP NEW TYSSA CONTENT
FINALLY. I've bern waiting for that road trip special ever since they hit the road; we all knew how it was gojng to go (lol)
About time!!! Good trailer (apart from the crone Fielding being the focal point) as only 'Mawdryn Undead', 'Enlightenment', 'The King's Demons' and 'The Five Doctors' are worth having.
Awesome trailer..
Will the 40th anniversary of The Five doctors feature a CGI Tom Baker at the end of the game of Rassilon !?!
it's about time, i've been waiting for season 20 ever since season 19 came out
I mean the 10 year old me is going to be jumping up and down.
This is so cool
3:07 or multicolored coat! 😁  Really nice minisode. REALLY nice! Thank you!
The 40th anniversary version of 'The Five Doctors' sounds fun, though I think I prefer the 1995 version of the time scoop compared to this new version.
The quality of these episodes are incredible. Almost looks like something filmed in 2023 trying to look like it’s from the 80s amazed seeing lis sladen like she were still alive on Tv
One thing about the Doctor Who, Blu-ray collection they know how to advertise and capture our imagination.
OMG That looks so good,  at long last we get season 20 and what a year for it to be released in the 60th Anniversary.  The Five Doctors is going to look spectacular on Blu Ray  with the new special effects. I for one will be making sure this boxset is sitting on my shelf.
Awesome!
'One Doctor, Two Companions' sounds like the porno of the year.
So it’s finally been announced after all these years
I’m just gonna ignore the Mara and pretend Nyssa and Tegan reunited and everything’s fine :)
Hey, BBC, can you PLEASE get season 9 to release in Australia? For some reason, the series has just stopped releasing down here.  Please?
Thought it was inside Sarah jane’s house on Bannerman road at the start lol
This whole think makes my 80's childhood come rushing back, and my jaded heart sing again. Thank for this, whoever is responsible for it. And I truly do hope that RTD brings some of these old companions back again. Power of the Doctor was a missed opportunity, but a setup ripe for building upon.
Who else thinks the Mara should make a return? Or Omega?
YEEEEEAAAAHHH!!!! HYPE!!
I'm sorry they are dismissing the Big Finish canon about Nyssa...
Sorry not canon! Nyssa and Tegan have been in a relationship for decades actually!
Was anyone else confused by this was it a special episode spin off an elaborate trailer for the new dvd box set?
Oh my giddy aunt! This is a thing of beauty
I've begun to look forward to the ads for the box sets just as much as the box sets themselves if not more! They really knocked this one out of the park!
Turlough was always such an interesting character - very different to any other companion as he was tasked to kill the Doctor which made his dynamic fascinating.
Wish these collections were Region 1. We in North America keep missing out on some great stuff!
Always remember the Keeper of Trakken.
Great to see Mark Strickson again.
Wonderful, it is a great idea ...
I'm glad Martin Clunes has finally stopped being embarrassed about his role on Doctor Who, sure the costume's lame and it was his first TV role but it's an incredible story and everyone involved should be proud of it.
Great, except... no mention of their fallen friend Adric? Yeah, I know he wasn't in this season, but I mean considering Nyssa was closer to him than Tegan was you'd think there'd at least be some mention of him. That's cold, man. 😭
They were part of my doctor. Yes, I remember Baker growing up in the 70s but Davison was when I truly remmebered it.
♥️♥️
lesbianism won today
TYSSA CANON BABY
How fantastic was this!!!! To watch Doctor Who as a kids in the 70’s and remembering the original stories. Seeing companions after all these years, just warms my heart. Love this!!!
I'm not crying, you're crying, shut up!
Can't wait, I had forgotten its 40 years since The Five Doctors was out...looking forward to all new updated effects and wasn't Janet and Sarah brilliant on this trailer... more plase and bring both of them back in the show!!
This was the moment Peter Davidson met his replacement
man tegan is just never allowed to be free of the mara
Tegan and Nyssa have always been my favorites.
Martin Clunes as a New Romantic is a seriously cool look, a real mood.
No NO, Please. I have no money... I spent it all on big finish to Listen to the people, don't make me spend more...  I'm sorry bank account. I'll work harder I promise
The best mini episode for a box set yet?  A strong contender I think!
Best episode of Doctor Who we'll see this year!!
Still patiently waiting for season 25 😐
Brave heart, Teagan
Oh my god this right here this this thiiiiiiiiissssssssss, this is Doctor Who the dread the anticipation the mystery the excellent dialog yeeesssssssssss my favourite childhood franchise is back in it's glory :) hats off to the production team on this many hats off thank you and lots of love.
Ohe heck yes
Completely LOVE this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
40th anniversary special edition of the five docs!!! HD film segments!!!!!
Sarah Sutton as Nyssa was always my favourite companion,  what a delight to see her again
Tegan and Nyssa together again is something I've been looking to seeing.
What an awesome collection. So much content.
This definitely knocks you for a loop. A lot of these trailers have been heartwarming, silly, or nostalgic. This one takes the route of teasing that with a fan-favorite pairing and references to the recent content of the modern era, making it seem like they're going in that direction until pulling the rug out from under you with a full-on return to Tegan's most traumatic experience in the classic series.
That Peter Davison, Janet Fielding and Sarah Sutton European Road Trip looks like something that could easily air on Channel 4 tomorrow. I swear the special features just get better and better.
how do we still not have peter saying the line reminding us to subscribe? is he refusing for a reason?
I have all the Collection releases, and this really does look like it might be the best one. The road trip looks so much fun, I can't wait to see that.
it's nice to see more of the tegan we meet in potd, id love to see a disney+ series that delves into this idea more. maybe the mara can be a recurring villian like the trickster or mrs wormwood was for sja and they could crossover with the other tegan who married nyssa maybe? these characters have so much potential, pls disney
Maybe Mr Davison should have kept to driving around with Christopher Timothy ???? :)
So well done. Great to see this as stand alone episode rather than just a regular DVD promo. Please do more of these.
Defo getting this and love how this mini episode is set after Power of the Doctor
I do like the idea that The Mara never really went away and is still somewhere inside Tegan. I was hoping for a small reference to that in Power of the Doctor.
special features like a german voice dub?
this has some major lore implications
Finally! Been waiting so long for this.
"What are you even doing here?"
Finally! We've been overdue a Peter Davison boxset for a long time, I'm pleased that the Five Doctors has new special effects, I look forward to watching that, I wonder what season will be next? Any ideas anyone?
So excited for this> I  can't believe I was 7 years old when I first watched these stories. Time flies!
My hype for this is HUGE!! Dare I say my hype is bigger on the inside than out!  I've been CRAVING a new Davison set for so long!! This can't come out soon enough!!  The minisode just blew me away, I'm speechless. Sutton and Fielding are perfect examples of "it's like they never left the show." I CAN'T WAIT!!
Please say I wasn't the only one fighting back tears to see Tegan and Nyssa reunited after all these years?
🤯❤❤❤❤❤
Was stoked to see they filmed this at Adventure Island
This got me in the feels cant wait for the roadtrip😂
Fab trailer- always loved the Mara stories
Standing ovation!!!
I love these little videos so much. This may have been the very best yet. As a longtime fan of Tegan and Nyssa from the days of PBS reruns in the early '90s, I never thought I'd get to see this.
Brilliant  Hope there’s a BFI event on the horizon
5:35 The Mara! I knew it!
Oh WHAT!!!!!!!     WOW!   🥳🎉
Wow and Wow!!!! Can’t get enough of this. Loving the nostalgia!!!!! 🎉 Well done….please take me back to the 80s!!!! 😉👏👏👏👏
2:22 It took me hearing her voice a second time to realize who that was. Nyssa! By “second time” I mean I rewound and listened to her say, “Hello, Teagan” again.
I watch classic Doctor who episodes on Pluto TV
To ALL MY FELLOW DOCTOR WHO FANS,  I can still remember, in my childhood memory, a hazy image of the old TV screen with the Davison starfield titles. And I also, remember VERY CLEARLY, a little me trying to imitate the theme music. "Balbalbalbalbal!"  And, then around 1989, my dear departed Mama, sent a typed letter to the BBC about "The Five Doctors" being available because I was a big Doctor Who fan (it wasn't long after seeing newspaper headlines like "Doctor Who exterminated by the street").  The response? That the title was deleted (OH NO! LOL). But, of course, they did release it and I had so many adventures with the Doctor and his companions (blimey all those different faces and costumes?!) through the 90s on good old VHS.  So, to ALL Whovians, new or old. May your time in the TARDIS be one of thrills, horrors, laughter, science fiction madness and strange creatures bent on world domination.  But REMEMBER: The Doctor is a SPLENDID chap. ALL OF THEM (even the lady one).  All my love to long ago, now and the future,  David A man who is proud to say he is and always will be a Doctor Who fan (who knows I may start having a dating life one day).
That was beautiful ❤️
Been waiting for this one!
Time to set some more money aside to get this one, which should be tagged "Peter Davison:  Complete Season 2" here in America when it's released in a few months.  The last Season 2 I got was really Season 2, William Hartnell's.  After watching Sarah and Janet doing "Behind the Sofa" on prior sets, this should be interesting.
Never been more excited hearing the Peter Howell theme!
The fairground scene was filmed at Adventure Island in Southend on Sea? :)
What a wonderful short, as usual the Collection series trailers blow it out of the water. Great stuff ❤
Brillianr
Just preordered my copy of Season 20 now. No release date yet but looking forward to getting it and watching it. Always great value for money.
This is very interesting and amazing 😮
omg this was great, well done guys and thank you
You could probably make an hour long or feature length film about contemporary Tegan resisting the Mara.
This is the ONE I've been waiting for!
I'm so excited. At last another Peter Davison Blu Ray box set. Season 20 was a great season for Peter. Glad we are getting the 5 Doctor's as part of it.
Mara-velous
YES ❤
It's so good to see these two and hear their voices again. I only casually watched the Fourth Doctor back in the day and did not really become immersed until Five took over. So, Tegan and Nyssa will always have a special place in my heart.
This has made me completely deranged Nyssa my love my beloved
Great to see this mini-sode! Janet makes an effective Dhukka - very reminiscent of Jeff Stewart's chilling performance!
If Tegan is in the spin off, we need a 3rd Mara story!!! My heart is bursting with love over this! If only Matthew Water- - - Umm, never mind.
I thought RTD said Nysa and Tegan was official and they were both living in Australia?
Best one yet. These collection trailers only get better. Pete McTighe needs to be show runner when RTD steps down again.
Yey more Tegan
What I want most is the Rifftrax Five Doctors. I understand if it's not included, but could you give the Rifftrax people permission to release it? Pretty please??
For the new and old fans alike seeing these minsodes between seasons and as teasers for box set releases definitely brings back the magic of the mad man in the blue box😉
Hooray for hi-def Sid Sutton credits!!!
Davison. My only solace is that it leaves but one Davison set left to disappoint me later. It's bad enough the first Davison set is the only one I don't have, soon it'll be two.  4:49 Oh no, they're doing the Snakedance thing. OH! IT'S THAT SEASON. [runs away screaming] "But it also has the Five Doctors." [runs away screaming FASTER]. As an American, I'll be getting Pertwee's third set/season tomorrow, keep up the good work, Classic Doctor Who.
I knew it wasn't over! Give Ace a spinoff, have Tegan/The Mara as one of the main villains.  It's good to see Sarah Sutton as Nyssa again.  Almost thought it was going to be Adric whose given the 'Winter Soldier' treatment
I love that Tegan is wearing her Power of the Doctor costume. And that Janet basically decided to wear it everywhere now, even outside of Doctor Who.
Peter was always my favorite dr
once a snake....always a snake
Hadn't seen this trailer, hadn't looked at the contents, hadn't seen the packaging.  I did see an email from Zavvi that said Doctor Who Season 20. Immediately logged in to purchase it. That is how much faith I have in this collection. I have zero doubt that it's going to be another fantastic set.
Sarah/Nyssa is one of my favorite companions. I’m so happy she’s doing a lot of special features.
Love tegan one of my favourite classic companions ever
Very happy they had done a new updated effects for The Five Doctors. It deserves the upgrade.
❤❤❤
Echoes of the past first glimpsed in Power of the Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa and the Doctor back together again ready to begin a whole new host of adventures :)
Nice reunion trailer  40yrs of 5 docs 60yrs of 15 docs  fantastic
This would be a crazy way to set up a legit spin-off... Right?
Is the US release going to make it this year?  Or are we pretty much done for 2023 given the Pertwee set just came out?
Really desperate to undo the damage that Chibnall/Whittaker did aren't they? Well they should dump Ncuti Gatwa too.  That casting is going to be a woke disaster and the death of the franchise.
So, Tegan's greatest desire is to be together with Nyssa. I mean, we all knew that already, but I didn't think they were gonna be THAT blatant about it...
Viendo dr who desde 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👋😎👍 saludos
BEST TRAILER EVER!!!!  LOVE IT!!!
I would love to see Martin Clunes play the Doctor if only for a special (ok, it's my head Cannon that Doc Martin is The Doctor stranded on Earth in a seaside village)
I was just googling when is the season 20 collection set getting released this morning, and now its actually announced! I'm so excited! The 5th Doctor is my joint favourite Doctor alongside 13 🥰
Sarah is still soooo beautiful.
So Tegan either is dead.. or... last min escape....
That’s mine ordered!😊
WHEN IS THIS COMING TO AMERICA!!?? 😭😭😭😭
Tegan dreaming about a boxset is now canon
What a treat this is, let alone the box set!!!
Wow the mara? Ive been thinking how nice it would be to see that enemy return too
@DoctorWho, it's Adventure Island, Southend, not Adventureland... 😉
Please add subtitles if possible, I’d love to be able to watch this properly
I love this
It's amazing seeing Martin Clunes being involved! He's become such a big star, one wouldn't be surprised if he turned his nose up at this. Wonderful seeing him and in such a jovial mood!
It would have been cool and canonical if Teagan woke up next to Nyssa in bed 😂
Peter Davison always seems so lovely. Like your favourite uncle.
The reference to "Kinda" was amazing :D Loved that story!
With this, it means there only 2 80s Seasons left to be released.
I haven't pre-ordered anything quicker! Must. Have. Purchase. Cannot wait to add Season 20 to my Whoniverse collection!
We missed you too, Ladies  :')   i FELT that hug.
That was fantastic, seeing Tegan and Nyssa reunite was so fulfilling and I loved the little touches with the Mara and I'm so glad the 5th Doctor ffinally gets another season on blu-ray, and I predicted that this season would be coming this year as it is the 60th anniversary of the whole franchise this year and it's also the 40th anniversary of Season 20
That poor prop is looking about as old as the 80s!
Great to see David Tennant's father in law on a wholesome road trip with his old friends from work
Greatest...Commercial....EVER!
Fan theory of mine. The 6th doctor was really the galifrey security guard who shoots the 5th doctor. He’s undercover for some reason in his own timeline and stumbles upon his past self…
❤
Awesome. Thanks bbc
Priceless!!2 Very underatrd companion!!
At this point I wonder how long Nyssa was actually where she left the doctor
This is basically a full on short film, and I love it! And awesome to see a post-Power of the Doctor Tegan (reuniting with Nyssa!) and love the reference to the Thirteenth Doctor, who Tegan has just recently met, I hope we see more of Tegan again in the main show and/or potential future spin offs, maybe even alongside Nyssa too!!
Tremendous trailer - best one yet! Can’t wait to get my hands on the set - looks amazing.
Reuniting Sarah and Janet again... Brilliant!¡! Especially since Janet recovered from cancer.
I kinda wanna buy this
Fantastic. These trailers certainly reflect the splendid collections they promote. My thanks go to all who put this together. Allons-y.
I was hoping for another 5th Doctor box set 🦇
Of course, this trailer is essentially a Buddhist parable.  Good old Pete McTighe!
Needs 4 more doctors on the cover and maxwell
I’m a bit concerned for Tegan’s welfare after that. Oh well, RTD will just have to bring her back. BUT CHIBNALL DID IT FIRST 😀
OK, I need this! 😊
let's go lesbians
You've outdone yourselves on this one! Well done!
These announcement each time a new blu-ray is coming is one of the best parts of it
hopefully this comes out before the 60th stateside! we still havnt got season 9!!
We need the Nyssa series now
I love how these trailers are mini episodes
Is this set after power of  the doctor
How many Box Set trailers can you name that have a plot twist?  Pretty much this one!
Without a shadow of a doubt THEE best trailer for these box sets thus far
Appropriate for the 60th!! ❤
Tegan didn’t complain about anything in this video. That must actually be a Zygon or a Dalek replicant or a ganger or something.
Tegan talking about Feminism. Not surprised from Doctor Woke.
Plus her and Nyssa x
That was beautiful loved Tegan forever xxx
Tegan & Nyssa: Best Friends Forever!  💖
Looks good. A real big collection there, extra features, new items. Pre-ordered on the spot!
Was waiting for another one to be announced
Hmmm,  will this be the sixth, or the seventh, time they've sold us "The Five Doctors"?!?!? Never mind, I'll still buy it LOLOL
I've so far got 2 of the Collection box sets, one with Jon Pertwee, and the other with Tom Baker!
LET'S GOOOOOO
It's a shame David Collings passed away. It would've been great to see him reunite with Davison and Fielding since he played as Mawdryn.
this is beautiful
Bring Nyssa Back!
Would like to think that after the Mara came back Tegan's dream just got really weird and the actual advert was also in her head :)
The Mara? Been a long time.
This is brilliant.
Another great trailer film by Pete McTighe!
The Nyssa reunion was nice even if it was a vision. The Mara should return in new who
Pray tell, BBC...  Will Australia be receiving this Box Set?   (Because we still don't have the last one!)
Gorgeous
If only this included the Rift Tracks of THE FIVE DOCTORS it would be perfect! I guess we will have to settle for very good.
The best yet!!!
I love how these trailers have evolved into actual, canon mini-sodes.  Awesome!
What a beautiful trailer🥺, one of my favourite tardis crews, and im really hyped for all the new five doctors content
Nice! /)
That's amazing ❤
💙💙💙
I have 4 words for this, Absolutely flipping love it!
Omg
I love how all these dvd announcement trailers are completely canon.
The absolute definition of something being worth the wait
It's here! Just in time for the 60th, we finally get another 5th Doctor Season!
Will the five doctors include the three previous commentaries? Including the secret commentary with Tennant and Phil Collison?
Who on EARTH okayed that dreadful Enlightenment CG  and included it in the trailer?! Those models looked amazing in the original.
Who it is ?
I never understand why people actually like these collections editons to begin with. These are just so boring and dull. I know its controversial, but to me, it's the truth. How does anyone think that this is a good thing I have no idea?! Please explain how
Would love to see a spin off of Teagan, maybe sci-fi thriller?
All these years and that damn snake still gives me chills!
OHHHH MY HEART!!! I cannot wait for Season 25 though... hope that is on the cards soon!!
aww lovely
It's be nice if they'd release the 5th doctor 40th special as a stand alone too.
Now we need Troughton boxset
I'm so excited for this
I was hoping to see season 1 or 13 on blu ray
About bloody time!
Love this, but Big Finish audios with older Nyssa have been ignored
I had a hunch this would be the next one. It’s the 60th anniversary this year and this was Classic Who’s big milestone anniversary year next to the 10th.
After seeing her return in The Power of the Doctor, I was not expecting Tegan to reunite with... Nyssa. And look, the gang's returned to Amsterdam! What a trailer! 🤩
I'm sorry, THREE stories with the updated Special Effects!!!  Where are these new effects on every DVD releases back in the day?!?
I really hope the easter egg commentary of T5D with David Tennant, Phil Collinson and Helen Raynor from the 25th anniversary DVD is included with this as well
Tegan was my second favorite of the 4th Doctor's companions behind Peri.
Tegan, Nyssa and the Mara????   YES
I don’t really like how a lot of farewell Sarah Jane is just being ignored. Like Ace getting K-9 and Tegan and Nyssa being a couple. Ofc they could say they just split up but the way they acted here is as if they haven’t seen each other in years.  Although I suppose it HAS been years since farewell Sarah Jane. ..
I'm gonna need a full series of Peter, Janet and Sarah road-tripling together 😂
Looks great an' all, but is it just me, or are the clips very waxy? If so, I guess that's just the trailer, rather than a demo of the product 🤷
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITED I'VE BEEN FOR A COLLECTION SET! LET'S GOOOOO!!!!
This is freaking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How on earth did you film at southend and I had not even a slightest inkling
This is everything I hoped for this season and more! I was never expecting a 40th anniversary edition of The 5 Doctors! I'm guessing updating the 5 Doctors is becoming a tradition. 😁
Doctor who the collection season 25 later in November
I had a hunch this season would be next blu ray release. Only appropriate as we’re in the 60th anniversary year and this was the 20th anniversary season.
I have NEVER been so excited for a collection set, this is looking to be the best one so far!!
After watching this, I just might start collecting Dr Who box sets. I already have Christopher Eccleston's season
YESSSSS
She said woman! The trailers are canon!
AT LAST! Looking forward to this!
Dead. Don’t usually buy the box sets but the 40th Five Doctors sold me.
Finally a Peter Davsion collection set❤
ALLONSY ITS FINALY HERE!!, isn't it funny we now have all troughtons appearences after season 6 before he gets his first set
Wow.
LET'S GO!!! Season 20 of Doctor Who: The Collection! Let's hope for The Celestial Toymaker on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc too!
The best of friends. So glad to see Tegan and Nyssa reunited
FIVE DOCTORS W LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
You have NO idea how long some of us have been waiting to see these two ladies hug again. ❤
This is so bloody cool
Omg!! I am so excited!!
Finally, another Davison set. It’s been too long!
Josh snares is gunnu lose it
YOOOOOOOOOO
@Doctor Who can you please do an animated movie with Rowan Atkinson's doctor from the children in need special?
Wait when was this filmed that’s at adventure island Essex 😂I live there
Thank you for this amazing gift on my 24th birthday Doctor Who YouTube Channel! Can’t wait for this boxset 💙💙
Are those beginning shorts cannon? I really want them to be
Is this a trailer or a full on short film!? I love it!!!
Well another Blu-ray collection once again.
AT LAST!!!
Hell yeah
My favorite Doctor Who season!!  It’s so good to see Sarah, Peter and Janet!!  Nyssa is my favorite companion
I have never bought the collections, always wanted to, but they are so expensive. But I always love these trailers 😍
Only a year to  wait for the standard edition now 😅
Nice.
Hi Everyone who's sees this I wish the an amazing day and is anyone else excited for the 60th Anniversary...?
Let's go! Finally a new Collection box set!
Slay
Excellent.
Ooh. I can't wait.
💙💙
OH HAPPY DAY!!!!
Finally! Lmao
