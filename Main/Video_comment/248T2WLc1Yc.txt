👏👏
Thanks Harry For Your Patience
Dalot celebrating cr7 😂😂
That was no more a penalty kick than the man on the moon.  What next Onana gives away a penalty for hand ball…?
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Garnacho is a trunk player who doesn't know what to do with the ball.
Gongrats on one of the easiest wins and winning 2-1
Dalot with that score hero finish
rashford tried it was a decent effort

“He should deliver to Rasmus” “hes too selfish” “low iq footballer”  3 potential assists but Hojlund missed all the chances. its so unfair that ppl just slandering Rashford when he didnt turn up 🤮
Rip sir bobby
Moments FC once again, I mean, it's become numb to the point where idc how we get a result as long as we get it. We're still miles behind other clubs. Spurs look well oiled, Pool will always scrap wins, Villa firing, City ofc, Arsenal don't give up, Newcastle, Brighton...
You need to start training you're in a mess of loosing
Scott Mctominay is One who the most underrated player in Man United...Fantastic performance
What A Win, Really Beautiful Team And Great Effort To Win The Game, Let's Keep Marching On Reds 🔥🔥🔥🔥👊👏👏❤️
We win it for Sir Bobby.
Who scored the first goal
Maguire man of the match. Legendary
rashford be trying to sabotage EtH ...same like sancho
What a goal from Dalot ❤
nice game by amrabat nice debut from this man ❤
😂😂😂 play man city next? 😢
Won 5 lost 4 , 11 goals for 13 against says alot about the club and it's keeper, wait til you play class we'll see then won't we
Hand ball is hand ball, can't wait for United to play class , we'll see how they play then ,won't we
Easy team again
boycott all social media platforms, GLAZERS OUT, wins like this can't distract from the larger issue
👏👏👏
GGMU🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Rashford
Palestina win
Another game in which we played to an average standard but had enough chances to win by three or four. Our conversion is so poor but the potential is definitely there. Love Dalot's passion!
Rashford is a misfit in this struggling squad
we will always remember bobby Charlton
GGMU!!
May you rest in heaven Sir Bobby❤
So we spent millions on a strike force and a soon to leave midfielder and a full back, pull us out of the smelly. Woeful. !!

Scott was a mess in this match even though he scored.but I prefer the manager to be using dalot as a winger and not a defender, for me when bisaka is back dalot should be given a chance to play as a winger and not as a defender because I see him like our second Ashley young or Valencia.
Dalotttt😊
crazy how far united has fallen... barely beating a team like sheffield.. overall they were actually better than united.. just a 2-1 victory? i mean come on... thats the difference between united and teams like, city, arsenal and liverpool.. they would have destroyed sheffield with like 3 or 4 goals overall.... get real here.. still a long way to go if you wanna be a top dog again..
bring back ole
🇵🇹
Rip Sir Bobby
Big 3 points for the team heading into a tough fixture at home to City. The manager still needs to find his best midfield partnership
This idiotic culture is why france is being kicked out of Africa. @Benzema freedom of speech, free Palestinian
Stupid performance.  Absolutely shambles. Awful. Guess the win will blinden your eyes. Nonsense. Absolutely nothing related to Manchester United. Ever worse performance
In loving memory of sir Bobby charlton. This man was an amazing player and it’s so sad to see a lenged pass away😢😢. We love you
slowly but surely
I watched the game, we were terrible. Happy for the win nonetheless
Another win which papers over the cracks. Massive improvements needed
But why do we play so bad? What do these lots do in training?
2:06 this sound only🥹
Clown 🤡 ten hag
That dalot goal hot
Great match Bravo man UTD
mu striker should give their salary to the midfielder
Onana should build up from this performance... Made some brilliant saves

Thank you for the win United # United forever
Rashford played amazing... Irony:👉Now he has learned to pass the ball to his friends but his friends forgot to pass to him.
Maguire's Redemption arc is REAL!
Great victory for Bobby Charlton farewell, flu high legend and Icon 🕊🕊
Funny how the commentator says "and the reds have the lead ,when it's actually Sheffield in red colour 🤭" Great win for Manchester united,what a hit by dalot
No more manu
He is making 39 great
RIP Sir Bobby 🙏🏻 💔
Next week Manchester Derby.. don’t lose…!!!
Hard game but happy with the win so many things to improve

Congratulations. I’m so happy and proud to my best team .
Whose voice is this? Makes me incomfort. 😢😢😢😢
This club and something called future no way they play as though they were from hsp adimission and straight send to the field number 14-10 will be a try and error this season.
Qatari s in
Ten Hag will never see what Tominay is doing
Why is onono so easy to score against him yet the coach can't leave him out of game ?? this is the only gate way for erik teg to go for sure it's either they're in one mission or another '' kill manchester united and we go or weaken the club by blaiming some and we go.
what a strike from Dalot!
hilarious
Diogo Dalot SCREAMER, Wins it, man United best best, menang 2 - 1
Did Ten Hag not shake hands with the Sheffield United manager?
Dalloooooot❤ one of my favorite players. Passion and gives 110%. And that right foot oh my goodness. Under rated by most fans

Galatasaray!!!
I'm really happy we got the win  But I personally they should play better cos they have the Manchester derby awaiting them next week
rubbish celebration
Maguire performed excellently well! Very impressed! back to back games. Wow!! Scott is on form, Amrabat is settling in nicely and Dalot strike was world class. We tend to struggle against teams that sit back and players need to either be creative or take initiative to strike ball outside the 18....Great win! poor overall performance! RIP Sir Bobby! forever a red! We love you
I will always go for McTominay....
Mctommygoat 🗣️💯🔥
This commentator is consistently terrible
Congrats Manchester United ❤
Poor commentary No intensity at all
Mctominay is not for sale,he has shown positivity
the goal from Dalot was a proper beaty
RIP legend 🕊️
Keluar juga dari goa😂
Congratulations reds .. aweomse performance from Maguire and Dalot ✨🎈❤️🎉👍🏻🎊❤️🎈✨

Only ten Haag ball I’ve seen is the bald ten Haag united have been horrible and still horrible
Dalot with the Cristiano Ronaldo pointing finger celebration ❤
😂🎉😢😮😅 0:22
I don't know the criteria for penalty kicks....
Every single Man United Fan need to understand the importance of a RED fighting for his place! That is exactly what Maguire is doing! He is fighting for something! His performance has improved drastically! Wan Bissaka did same thing!  Ego will ruin Sancho!!!
I love the football
RIP LEGEND 🎉

Dalot's great goal is same as Carrick's destroying AS Roma in UCL
Amrabat the link between  defense and attack
Manchester United till my last breath ❤️
Stupid penalty, what did they want him to do … chop his arm off?
You would think that according to this video we played well BUT once again we were trash
A Pathetic embarrassment to Charlton! Maguire played well against the bottom team? SO WHAT! He cost £80 million!
masih ada harapan
Fffff Portugal is so strong 🔥
زين هالله هالله هالله زين
Ten hag out
cant believe we make scott a sub so many time when he effortlessly scoring like that 😂
Big Scott is a better striker than Martial surely We gotta make more shooting outside the box to break down the deep sitting defenses
Bobby Charlton - легенда английского футбола. Спасибо за игру.
RIP sir bobby charlton. may you live in peace in heaven. I pray for your family ❤
GGMU!🔴
Whats the spitting gesture means...just be careful guys with the games played..😅
the late and great sir bobby charln
Maguire is improving and honestly looks more reliable than both varane and martinez
Man u will win city mark my words
Maguire did well yesterday TBH
Buuuuuuuuu😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
I'm not sure we can win City with this team....
❤🎉
Amrabat's shot was also spectacular, what a screamer that couda been
mc tominay reminds me of fellaini, tall midfielders who loves scoring
This was for Sir Bobby. He would have been proud of both goals <3
We still need to improve in front of the goal, most shots were from the wide
Против мю это пенальти? А с другими не пенальти? Вообще-то кто знает пенельи а когда не пенальти
Poor Bobby...was so tired of this mu performance last few years..cant make it. R.I.P/
I feel diogo dalot would make a better midfielder than as a defender. The guy is wasting away in that role
All funny goal 😂
He deserves more respect, Harry maguire
These players just never make it easy for us, the fans.
If you think Maguire put up a man-of-the-match performance, you should know how low Manchester United has stooped to meet his standards. Please do not confuse the point, the man is doing his best.
GGMU❤️‍🔥
Mctominay playing in that same role he does for Scotland
Mctominay has to mkae sure he orchestrates 2 goals for manunited😂
#1 stat in touch and pass... Maguire MOTM!!
Maguire is showing what he can do
Especially that 2nd goal scored by Dalot... 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Firstly, R.I.P...Sir Bobby Charlton... who will be remembered as a Man Utd great and footballing icon...thank you for all you did at the club...may your soul rest in peace...
Freedom to Palestine 🇸🇩🇸🇩
I miss Tenancious FRED, we need him more than we like to admit.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
McTominay is a striker...
Why he's not playing Donny😓
Who ever told Mctorminay to be a midfielder should go to jail. Blud should be CF 😭
Cmon United!
สิ้นตำนานแมนยูครับ❤❤❤❤❤❤
เป็นกำลังใจให้ทีมแมนยูครับ❤❤❤❤❤
Central defenders take 10 seconds to pass the ball to left and right back, a lot of time wasted, it gives always time to the other team to recover position..this reminds me the "great" Van Gaal era..
A magic effect on maguire
A simple fan like me knows the attack strategy on the right or left is Rasford (cut to his left) n Antony (cut to left) both one-sided play. For Antony, he required Dialot to cut to the right, so to confuse the defend a bit. I know how to deploy my defence. "Using Garnacho to cut into the middle of the field??". He is the only one with the potential skill.
RIP Sir Bobby Charlton, he was a footballing legend 🙏  My condolences go out to his friends and family
RESPECT SCOTT MCTOMINAY & HARRY MAGUIRE
2-1 against the last place team & it wasn't really a very convincing win!
Please Make McTominay as SS or AMF. And  we will see what can he made
Great come back Manchester United
onanna unnana ohhhhhh
MU played against 11 player + a goal
Maguire and mctominay  making comebacks
Bro de gea is better than onana why d’itn let him stay💀💀💀💀💀💀
How many times we relay on individual briliance ,where is the team work ??
Bro had the nerve to call these “highlights”😂
Give Van de beek some playing time plssssssssss !!!!!
Sekelas Manchester united lawan Shefiel sja ngap ngapan,nyu emnyu

Away winning a tribute to the late MU legend player ever!
😱😱
Clown performance 🤡  from a clown club 🤡 .   Were still scraping past the likes of Sheffield and were celebrating like we won the league. Ten haag fixed the problem against Palace in the carabao then made the same mistake again 🙄🙄🙄  We need to scrap all the players with ego and reinstate the junior players that played against Palace.
Man united is the best team in the world even if they lose
Dalot with the Ronaldo celebration
What a fvcking screamer 😅😅😅😅❤❤❤
That one was for Sir Bobby. Hopefully Rashy beats the club scoring record
Please keep playing Scott as number 10 and Bruno as number 8
sofyan amrbat long shot 😮
Bruno was a disgrace but no one is ready for this conversation.
Hery maiguer on fire
dalot score like a classic moutinho in his prime... now ten hag should try dalot for CDM, just try
Anthony is such a terrible right wingers! Better go and practise more in crossing the ball,  no deep run and horrible crossing 😮
Remember how Maguire said last year that he hadnt lost a home match in months? Well, seems to be a great performance whenever he takes the pitch now.
Dalot pohaaaa 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:43 man wearing white jacket of MU with glasses on along side Eric Ten Hag  ...looks like Sir Alex Ferguson
Magnifique but de dalot , super match de Amrabat et dommage pour le poteaux sa aurait etait un Magnifique but aussi , onana s'améliore de plus en plus et maguire de même , MU ❤
Free Palestine
Ronaldo ngegolke preekik
Which Cross Bar Challenge was the best ??
This win was for Sir Bobby Charlton❤
use 4-4-2, r10 & h11 both strike
You need to up your game lads. Anyway 3 points important
the commentator is funny idk why
still waiting for Rashford's first goal for us
Our fowards keep on misfiring... For how long will we keep on relying on midfielders to score????
A win for SIR BOBBY is always remarkable!!!  With our first away Kit win for this season.  Forever Red!!
Dalot wat a finesse
Sack the commentator
Rest in peace sir bobby charlton. Fly high🕊
RIP, Sir Bobby Charlton, gone but not forgotten.
I'm glad they won on such a sad day for Man United and England and World football. RIP Sir Bobby the magical Busby Babe
They always bring a comeback
영광의 시대가 다시 올거라 믿고 싶다.
The mighty man united millions  of fans in 200 country's in the world
It’s weird we criticized Rashy for being greedy, multiple chances he could have had to bury the shot, instead he passes and Holjund is just an inch off execution. We may be out of the race, but if we can fine tune and make a come back in all other competitions, I’ll take that as success.
If we didn't inprove in the next game, man city cooking us. So try to control the game than run more than opponents try to win and play for the Batch play for this club. This is the club we love Manchester United. C'mon boys let's do this
I still feel manu is not upto the standard required to be in top 4
Another McTominay great finishing, and Maguire winning rate still high
My team ❤💯🔥🔥🔥 RIP Bobby Charlton
Finally we actually won a game
Onana and Maguire played well but it was a terrible performance overall.
Semangat united
DALOT WHAT A GOAL!!!!!
맥토미니를스트라이커로가자
Bruno, Onana & Rashford.... Every match under performance 😏😏😏
No one is talking about Onana today... United fans 😂😂😂
Menang buat apa😂
Ugly win
Absolutely hate the green and white,but i appreciate the win boys.
Victory in honor of Bobby Charlton❤
ETH is terrible
Bobby Charlton was honored by the win
Mctomminey in the midfield today averaged 9 passes in 60 minutes and you guys want him too play??😂😂😂 you guys want us to get bullied by city 10-0??
Great strike, that penalty was a nonsense. RIP Bobby
Onana need to be appreciated too, he did well I can see some improvement
R.I.P SIR BOBBY CHARLTON 🕊🕊🕊
Kemenangan yang fantastis
we switch that midfied role from tonny to 2nd striker.,his doing it well mehn!😇
Very poor performance! :(
I wish the late Sir Bobby Charlton could've witnessed a strong and successful ManUtd team after Sir Alex Ferguson's reign. Sadly, that was not the case.   He left this world with a gazillion memories and historical feats for the national team England and once the greatest club of all time- Manchester United.
HAJI MAGUIER EMANG TOP
I can’t believe Rashford missed that🥹
MC tominay ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Scott being proving his point lately 🪐🔥🔥
Onana has stepped up 🔥
Tumben tim antah berantah MU menang
Great game. Scott, Maguire and Dalot, awesome appearances!
ini piala apa cuk
For the first time in my 20yrs of being an avid fan of United as a 30yr old, I couldn't care less what result United procured....  Springboks were playing at precisely the same time in a Rugby World Cup Semi, it was an easy decision... Country over everything... ❤  But I was glad to learn later that the boys procured all three points, albeit from all the online analysis, we still play like headless chickens... 💔
Dalot doing the CR7 celebration
Unpopular opinion: Man U should buy Pedro Neto from Wolves. Definitely one of the best left wingers presently in the premier league
Andre onani🤦
Msh ampas walaupun ez
RIP Sir Bobby. Had the absolute privilege of seeing him play from the mid 60’s onwards. Icon.
Maguire and Onana were solid at the back Scott Mctominay is on fire 🔥🔥 this season scoring week in week out for both United and Scotland 👏 GGMU 👏
RIP Sir Bobby 🙏🏻
Maguire MOTM
Rest in peace Sir Bobby, great win lads <3 MUFC Forever
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉mam United
Harry maguirre be the legend for now
Keep McTom in false nine or second striker, Dalot in CM, Lindelof as LB 🤔
McTomminay on the 9
RIP bobby Charlton
Hello
All those stripes gave me a huge headache
Copenhagen 2-1 manU
what a disgusting kit
Мю платит за игроков атаки по 100 000 000,а забивают защитники и опорники😂
Maguire and onana have improved a little bit in this game
Why is our football not easy fluent passing we always play like it’s hard work to do the simple things.only just beating Sheffield Utd is embarrassing like our season to date.
ETH OUT
imagine we scored all our chances they would have been some greats goals😭🔥 rashford chance,amrabat😭 even bruno
I really hate this green jersey
RIP SIR BOBBY!!!! 🔰🔰🔰 GLAZERS OUT 🔰 🔰🔰
Indonesia ❤ MU
Harry Maguire what a comeback this could be for him!
This win was for Sir Bobby Charlton🕊
So united have started taking long distance short..
Well done
The highlights really don't show what the game had to offer. I wanted United to play like Sheffield last night. Their press and creativity was something to envy. They just lacked the finishing they needed. Otherwise, this would have been another story.  Untied really lacked creativity, it was hard to watch. I don't even know if you can call it build up play but it just had no purpose.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
RIP Sir Bobby Charlton. Legend.
Two woodwork and couple of missed chances. We would've won this game comfortably but a win is a win. Let's keep winning more. GGMU 💪.
Best club ever
I really want to see Eriksen out on the pitch more often, our midfield just gains that extra touch of control, and the whole team seems to breathe easier. There's always intention to where he places himself on the pitch, and he always seems to know where to pass next which makes the entire dynamic of the team much for fluid. Without him, I feel as though the team is often playing a very improvised game and sorta just making these last-second decisions which is why it's always seemed so messy and slow on the attack. That obviously then raises a question when the team needs to take a more defensive approach because it's obvious to everyone he doesn't have much physicality to him... but then again he's never really had much of that yet he's experienced a lot of success in the past and so have the teams he's played for. I think on a very confrontational 1v1 Eriksen's physicality won't be much of an issue, but it's more when he has to chase down the man with the ball on the long straights I see his physicality being a bit of an obstacle. So sure he may not be the Hulk per se, but I think if we want to experience a better attack, then we need players like Eriksen who can provide that extra depth and fluidity.
They play terribly
GGMU
Mc tommy is on fire
Lack of creativity, not much self-confidence, lack of discipline in team defence, and a few more points will be problematic in the next games.
McTominay's feet got some magic. Almost every strike of him has been clinical in front of goal. It's unfortunate that he conceded a penalty but again, what a winning goal and a banger from Diogo Dalot. A goal of the month contender 😍🔥🔥🔥.
Gamst😂
Newcastle vs Sheffield United 8:0  Manchester united vs Sheffield United 2:1 😂 I'm bot ready for Newcastle V Manchester United
Much needed win but our general play is slow and laborious 😥
Rest in peace Sir Bobby Charlton 🎉
Hanya 2-1 ... Sungguh tim medioker amat skrg 🤮
What the MU now...!!!  Black white ? 😢😢😢
Anyone with a telegram link that has free betting tips?
Sir Bobby.. fly free through the angels..
تقفون حداد على شخص واحد ولاتقفون حداد على قضيه راح ضحيتها الاف الابرياء ؟؟!
I want Man Utd to sell Harry Maguire asap, but he did a great job in this match tbh
I Predictited that united will win 1-2
It should have been 4-1 too many unlucky post defelection. And Maguire is playing better than Varane.
😟🙁☹😮😥😢🙏
we won it out of the individual quality not team quality
Manchester will miss Sir Bobby Charlton 🙏🏼
Maguire did well
Maguire did well
2:35 why is the bald fraud ignoring the sheff utd manager
Hundreds of comments and yet Onana is far from being mentioned😢. Let's encourage our goal keeper, he'll certainly arrive❤
I just watched the same highlights on the Sheffield YouTube channel and the commentary was way more exciting
What  a goal from Dalot
What  a goal from Dalot
The commentary is underwhelming for that Dalot goal.
S McT brilliant start with his goal and sensational goal from Dalot for 3 points which paid respect for Sir Bobby Charlton. Rest in peace sir.
SİR BOBBY CARLTON 🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
All Maguire needs is to maintain that aggressiveness and courage.
Should Mctominnay play same role as Bellingham at madrid?
ICARDI!
I always predict 2-1 Exept the big games
Wow.,congratulations boys
We were so bad again its unacceptable now
Glazers out
There is room for improvement...we can do better
Not our greatest performance by any standard...but a win is a win... We won the game and let us keep winning that is all
We want extended highlights🔥
I'm arsenal fan but i think mctominay can be like the Scottish meastro Darren Fletcher en can play as second last in central defence
хуя се, как Амрабат пробил, почти, я бы орал до утра
Mctominay is brilliant.
Onana could of saved the penalty if he didn't go to ground early
Terrible gameplay
RIP 🥀 The one and only Sir Bobby
Reminds me of Ronaldo NGL
This is for you Sir Bobby🌹 Rest In Power🥀
Diogo saves our day against worst club in the prem on paper. But at last 3 points is al we need, we move.💚🤍 Rest In Peace to on of the best players our club has ever seen, Sir Bobby Charlton.🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
The only positive from our recent terrible performances, is that somehow miraculously we're only 6 points from the top! So hopefully as we go deep into the competition, the team will improve and play better.
RIP SIR BOBBY
that dalot goal is fireeeeeeeeeee
🔥
United winner
That one was for Sir Bobby! GGMU!❤❤❤
Martial play like the slowest animal on planet Earth Slot... Bruno 😢😢😢😢😢😢 Man of the match lindelof
Scott mctoilet had 9 passes in that game how sub standard is that in a utd shirt
맹구딱
Man United please continue this winning streak. And please beat Man city I am a true United fan since my age 3 now I am 14 My Whole family's 12 members support Man United this is from Maldives 🇲🇻
Can see during the early game, Rashford look like don't want to play...don't bother to open the space for the next attack and just walk instead of running...
We still luck pace and creativity on the ball.  Its gonna be a tough one against a big team
I still don't understand how a team like United keeps this coach so mediocre
Dalot showed amrabat how it's been done 😍
What does Man United do in training!?
After that "performance" from Martial, January can't come quick enough, he was more zombified than usual, and that's saying something
The Ten heg made me hate Man United
never a pen ffs
tbh i fell asleep arnd the 60th min cos it was boring and i didnt think anything else would happen
We hit more wood than pornhub😅
Another week where I can’t make fun of man utd they are back
Glory Glory MU 🎉🎉
For Bobby,  we'll played lads ..he would be so proud of you now . R.I.P Sir Bobby gone but never forgotten
Dalot king
RIP Bobby Charlton
fernandes king
Weird to see them struggles against the weakest team in prem this year 🤔
great performance lads and r.i.p Sir Bobby Charlton may your beautiful soul rest peacefully legend 💔😭
ETH is lucky there, another game to win not because of his tactics. The opponent is the bottom team of the league, dont get over excited please. 😅
how i hope we have a better commentator to light up the vibes
Lucky win ,meet Man City playing like this?
Winning for sir bobby charlton❤️
Semoga selalu konsisten. Selamat jalan legenda "Sir Bobby Charlton"😢
From one wingback till another. This is not something that happens often. Two great goals from McTominay and Dalot!
Menang nya satu satu hahahah . Menang gol nya ga produktif 😢
Even Barbatov
Never give up 👍Rip Sir Bobby
This club will never win the league again!!
Sheffield keeper has poor reaction time.
RIP. Sir Bobby Chalrton.
This is a joke, Mcguire and Evans shouldn't even be in the Premier League; let alone at Man United.   I've boycotted matches and only watch highlights now.
Clown club ever 😂😂😂
Maguire Steel Mode ✊
Tired of winning by 1 goal all games
แบบนี้แฟนแฟนมีความสุข❤❤❤
Maguire world class⚡⚡
❤❤
The first half was dreadful. It seemed like we were playing against Real Madrid's prime.😢
GGMU 🔥 😈
Defeating Sheffield United and acting they have won the EPL, 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Excellent goal from Dalot. Really wanted the Amrabat shot to go in!
bruno passes the ball to the opponent so many times, 😅which led to many turnovers😵‍💫can we have a midfielder who can pass the ball accurately?🤔
Glory Bobby Glory!!!
roket
RIP Bobby Charlton 💔💔💔💔💔
What a shot by Amrabat & what a goal by Dalot!! Congrats MU
Bring back De Gea !
Maguire carried
United should not be scrapping wins against Sheffield United
What happened to Rashford? He looks so dull 😢😢😢
This is Man United. No need the so called "beautiful football" but we need victory. Keep  shooting at opponent's goal will create bigger chance to win. Thia game reminds me to Man United with Paul Scholes where there were so many shots from outside the opponent's penaltt box. Awesome!
McGuire, Evans, Mctomminy what a manager 😂
My condolences to Sir Bobby Charlton family and to the rest of the United😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
🎉
Dalot teaching rashford and bruno how to shoot!
Antony is so bad no matter how much I think about it.
Struggling against Sheffield United must be worrying indeed, a team that conceded 8 goals vs   Newcastle.
GGMU🇾🇪❤⚫️🔴
Mc tominay will get his first award as a united player I believe he is to be player of this month am soo sure
Stay dangerous boys...on we match
Great job Manchester United awesome goals highlights for ever .
Vamos united❤👏 Glory Glory man united❤
No one is talking about Onana's saves…
Onana out 🖕
Dalot!😮😱👏💪
❤
why Onana still playing..? give a chance the other goalkeeper for play.
Please give Mc.Tominay striker
United possessed passed and created more opportunities than previous games but we got to convert our chances.. Congrats on a much needed win
For you Bobby 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Mctominay is a striker.
❤
I think bayindir better than onana
3 points
Beggars can't be choosers so I'll take it. Rashford has to score that chance and we did hit the crossbar a couple of times so there is mild improvement. An amazing strike from Dalot that Sir Bobby Charlton himself would have been proud of. May he rest in peace. Onto the Derby🙏.
We will win the EPL.
I'm starting to lose hope in Ten Hag. It's just not the players alone, but something ain't right with the manager as well. I mean, can anybody explain our style of play? Coz I don't see what the manager is trying to do at all. Any manager should be able to scratch out a playing style by now, even if it's a second string team. Coz these lucky Wins ain't gonna last long. I can see another thrashing coming soon from the Liverpools and Citys. 🤦‍♂
Ten hag is gonna be the coach to unlock mc tomminay
Imagine seeing Man Utd win a match, Onana make a save , and Maguire🐐 get Man of the Match.
macthoney on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally ETH starts McTominho, and you see how he scores.
Legendary top scorer in MU!! McTominay!!
Лучшие места впадающие это защитники
Poor highlights.
Let Mctomnay go forward like a free bird.  he will score more. If we give more pressure with defence duty then he can't perform well.
GGMU
what a screamer from dalot komon lads
Maguire and onana have improved ❤
❤❤❤
❤
United were terrible again a very poor Sheffield. E7H will be sacked by xmas. Guy has to plan
La prochaine fois je préfère une domination dans le jeu
Worst kits mu ever
I was just watching Maguire's performance, fantastic one today ❤❤❤❤❤
Macrominator
Rashford performance is going downhill
完全看不懂bruno這場在幹嘛，每次後場守下來他就一腳亂踢直接還回對方後場…對陣排名墊底的球隊，中路突破能力為0，只能靠拉邊，對方2-3人來關門邊路也廢了，這場贏的很運氣…戰術也有很大的問題…
What a performance by Onana
Look at bruno , he is unseen virus of the club , he is not the person he plays in portugal
R.I.P SIR BOBBY CHARLTON LEGEND OF MANCHESTER UNITED 🙌 👏
I hate the fact that we start playing after 25min.. we could have lost from a better opposition by then.. too much sloppiness in how we start off games
Dah biasa
glazers out
Prime man utd 😭
Glory, glory MU!!!!!!! 😍
So what there third rate overpaid under skilled fake woke United . Don’t enjoy watching the crap 💩.
Free palestine ❤🇵🇸👆
We opponent fans maguire is not giving out our expectations😢😢
👍
Maguire and McTominay keep rescuing our club, it's time to put some respect on their name!
This performance is Man United
Unlucky Hojlund
Rest in peace ,Sir Bobby Charlton ❤🕊
Maguire be better goal keeper he would of attempted to save the penalty way better for some reason i there  noticed there shooting abilities have improved😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Man u will win
Diogo Dalot  🔥🔥🔥🔥
Harry Maguire 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Honestly no mistakes from Maguire is the highlight. I'll take that over a win anyway . If this guy gets his confidence back we'd actually have a backline
Dalot celebration like Ronaldo did
Amrabat❤
Performance 🤡🤡💩🤡🤡🤡💩🤡🤡
ugly win is what United needed
miss maguire blunder
DALOT SAVE US,BUT NEED TO PUT MORE IMPROVED ..BUT 2 PLAYERS HERE MAKE THINGS WORST..LIDERLOFF AND ANTHONY..
Struggling vs Sheffield what a joke this club deserves relegation
Maguare main MU menang ... Semoga bisa konsisten smpe Akhir musim bermain bagus trs
It was a beautiful goal from Diago D
It's a shame that a team filled with so much talent only relies on long balls and counter attacks, even the bottom team's game is more entertaining than his strategy.
2:04 😮⚽🔥💪
Scott McSauce doing Scott McSauce things 😁🤫
I slept for second half 💀what a goal from dalot
Rip bobby
TODAY I CAN SEE TAT ONANA PLAYED LIKE DEGEA. WE NEED DEGEA TO TRAINED HIM
GGMU❤🎉
That performance was poor
So many chances
It is a lucky win
Although it’s a win, but still a poor game and long way to go to build this team. Winning only by 1 goal margin and conceding a goal against the lowest rated team where other PL teams have thrash them by far greater margins isn’t something worth celebrating for now
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
we need to play better though !!!
So our attackers can't score huh
Lovely
What a HIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
where Ball Build up ? i see long pass old school England !
Rashford just couldn’t score😢
Still no where existing in the competition 😂😂😂
Absolute banger from Dalot
RIP Sir Bobby❤🤍🖤 Wonderful goal from Diogo and comeback
0:23 Welcome back Rooney !
Congrats..Mc Tominey and Dalot..💪👏🔥 Concentrate to next game win..💪🦵🔥🔥
Barely made it past the worst team in the league. Ten Hag on fraud watch
Maguire was underrated tbh this match hopefully he performs like the rest of the season
Change McTominay's position from midfielder to striker with Højlund playing with 2 strikers or McTominay and Højlund playing alternately as a single striker. For Martial there is no hope anymore. Finish.
Bruno Fernandez needs to work on his passing accuracy!! Pains my heart every time he gives the ball away!, so unprofessional!
RIP Sir Bobby Charlton. Thanks for everything
What a strike 😮
in the thumbnail dalot was literally looking like ronaldo with those expressions......
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Free Palestine
Newcastle 8-0 😂 man utd is a joke
Dont come to ot if you dont want glazers stay
Maguire is clearly fighting for his place at Manchester United🫡
Whoever Youth Coach Who Turned Mctominay in the CDM need to be Arrested😅😤
Our first ever win in this beautiful jersey
Lord Maguire with the masterpiece
We want a better commentator who has a passion for goals from Man Utd
Mctominay on a whole different level this season, easily United's MVP
As liverpool fan, long live McSauce😂😂
Dalot just sublime from the top drawer
Onanana
Rashford busy doing nothing 😢
These refs have no idea in handball
Boggles my mind that Rashford gets paid what he does. He is mediocre.
This is Manchester that we want not only focus on Striker to Score but everyone tried to score open better chances than keep receiving attack and not counter back
Bruno brain should be investigated whaat a pass!😂😂😂😂
Garnacho is better than Egoist Rasford
Glory Glory manchester United..
Yes, Free Palestine
MC tominay stiker ❤
Much better game from Onana. This will help his confidence a lot
Mctominay>Case
we will miss you sir bobby a personal hero for me and a person truly worth the title legend ❤
RIP
1 plate noodles with extra spice.
we just dont know how to control the ball, no matter who we against
Rashford is an actor
SACK TEN HAG
Half time we play so bad..but in second half we do better...👍👍
As Onana step up today. Harry Maguire was in his best today defending well, switching the play from left to right and blocking shots. If this continues Maguire will turn to be best as he was a Leicester city 🤞👊💪
I'm happy to see Maguire come back
Onana seperti de gea yang baru masuk, dia masih beradaptasi semua membutuhkan proses yang baik, ingat degea kebobolan 8 kali saat lawan arsenal ?? Ggmufc
Tbh its a little worrying even tho after 2 wins back 2 back...both games were againts "lesser" teams...both games man united struggle mostly in the games but "switched on" when they knew they were struggling...why couldn't they switch on from the start?...if againts the likes of brentford and sheffeild they play like this idk how if united will handle with teams like city or arsenal...btw maguire was decent yet again..hope he continues to improve further...
what a goal from dalot 🔥
United missing so many chances which could have cost them the game
Why glazer not out?
Amrabat Strike Was Just Incridible❤❤❤
Mctominay is one form and it's beautiful to see ❤️❤️
Maguire my man of the match
WE WANT GLAZERS OUT!!!
Dalot the celebrate merchat finally celebrate his own goal
Dalot Dalot Dalot🎉🎉🎉
Bad performances, lucky win
McTominay must be a number 9!!!
Cik baju eta ulah dipake
Honestly McTominay should just play striker from now 😂
The commentary was underwhelming for a goal of that calibre
Our skipper maguier is back 🔥🔥🔥
Scott mctominay i will Appreciate him❤
I think it's time Mctom should transition into an attacking midfielder rather than holding one. He's Ok-ish as a holding midfielder but if improves his ball control and a bit of finishing practice coupled with his physical strength can make him a very capable attacking midfielder.
United forever
Bruno out
every other player in man utd is starting to score except for the forwards 😂 might as well sell them😮‍💨
We always don't play well on the pitch, can we plz fix that
Mctominay in his prime
Rest in heave, Sir Bobby Charlton.
🍑🔥🍑🔥
rigged
Maguire 🔥
Manchester united for life
We Stand Palestine🇵🇸
We Stand Palestine🇵🇸
WHAT A SHAMEFUL PERFORMANCE
We need bad keeper to make Maguire unlock his potential
luv this... less dribbling into the box
The way he point his finger and the way he run it remind me of ronaldo
Moments FC again. We need to fix this problem asap
The Special One once said : "with diogo dalot, Man United will have a right-back for a decade"
That many chances and only scored 2 goals
Lords
Mu hilang ciri hasnya. Baju merah.
Awesome Harry Maguire🎉🎉🎉
Casemiro was the problem 💯
Maguire 5 star performance, won't lie
A win is a win.Go REDS !
"Expirience"  won
Typical Ronaldo run-up after scoring from Dalot. 👏Screamer indeed, what a way to pay tribute Sir Bobby Charlton. GGMU!!!
i love this commentator style just like a Pro Evolution Soccer from Konami
Lets make old trafofd emty...it make glazer out
Sheffield!!😢😢
Wasn't the greatest performance but Maguire did pretty well in this match
GGMU❤🇰🇪
Молодцы! Только вперёд!!!
When dalots shot went in, my kid bro was screaming "check your pulse please," thats when i knew wat it means😂
They win yes ... But they there's so many things they need to be fixed and improve . They need to do a simple pass , not just wasteful direct pass and sometimes they too hasty. About the finishing, It's okay sometimes you put some ego in it but don't be overdoit and be more teamwork.. put more trust on your teammates..
diogo❤
Okay. l get it now.... ten hag's system has the aim to make everyone a goal threat. To push the team into the final third and start firing shots rather than depend on strikers only. No wonder our attempts have been greater than 10 most games
A smash-and-grab against Sheffield? This club is really fjnished. Lol.
The miss by hojlund, rashford and Garnacho were absolutely drastic
I thought dalot already passed away after mctominay second goal in the last match. But he still play today.
still carried by the defenders, same as the last 3 season, we carried by de gea for the last 2, and now by mctominay? what the f happen with our fronts?
y
McTominay would be a world class striker at a club like Real Madrid. United is holding him back and playing out of his best position.
Harry has play so nice today the guy is really improving
ONANA FAIL GOALKEPEER LORD
Mctominay was playing as a second striker. And the way he controlled the ball and scored was a proper no.9 performance. He's underrated in front of goal
as a derby rival fan i think man utd could finish top 6 this year not like mid table like some jokes
kembalikan Mctominay pada posisi aslinya sebagai STRIKER
so what? a win is a win.
GGMU, comeback red devils 😈🔱
Average team
Dalot doesn't score but when he does ☠️☠️
Suiiiii
Outside the box, i waiting it..
Sir bobby legend !!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Rest in Peace Legend 🥀
Poor performance IMO, this team is far from top 5... :(
RIP SIR BOBBY CHARLTON LADY CATHY FERGUSON
Weldone guys. We must continue like this.
Maguire long pass just incredible
But this performance is to weak for us   to defeat Copahagen and also Manchester City
RIP Bobby Charlton ✝️
this refree is always against us
scott the goar
Glazer Out✊️
McSauce needs to go back to the striker position. He’s position when he was a Man Utd youth. He has the striker’s instincts and the calmness to get the ball in net.
Bad game for playong long ball, and to be honest bruno was very2 awful when give a pass
Antony❤
Maguire was so lit...won every header!! 💯💯💯
Nice feeling to win away
Congrats Man utd on stealing a win from a superior side
Midfielder and defender doing the strikers job
GGMU
I almost fell asleep watching these highlights!!!
As a city fan thats not a penalty
LETS GOO 3 POIN🔥🔥, Rip Sir Bobby🥀
Percayalah.. kalau bgni² mainnya MU trus akan hancur.. kasian😢
Amazing celebration by McBurnie. How did that work out.  They still have 1, one, point    Cocky too early
Harry magar ❤❤❤❤now he is back like he play for lichester
Maguire back to his best.i salute him after he went through
A very very lucky wins, thanks to Dalot.
lawan tim kecil aja terseok seok
McTominay must be change position to CF/ST 😂
Respect harry Maguire ❤
This is not United, because not Comedy
Nah kaya kuwe menang kan aku melu seneng😊
Can Dalot shoot or what?
RIP Bobbie!
Finally Manchester United was win
You can never win the league just by expecting the lucky😂
Mctominay hand is given but not Romero 😅
Mctominay ❤
RIP Sir. Bobby Victory for United.🤍🤍🤍
I have to be honest and say for me i was blown away by Maguire's performance today, I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me but the whole second half i was saying he was man of the match for me, it can't be easy for anyone to go through the slagging off he gets week in and week out but credit where it's due and all that, we don't know what personal demons he may be battling and he's a human being after all. Oh err Glazers out!!
RIP LEGEND
Start Maguire bench bruno and rashford
amazing commentary
Man utd🎉
MC tominay must be the main striker
mu No :5 + No:34 =⚽️🎯🥅
Respect 🎉🎉
What a win!!!
I think McTom should be a striker
McGuire against all odds
МЮ❤
this one for sir bob😢
Finally Man Utd won a match with Ten Hag😂
Великолепно! В стиле Мю
Onana ngapainnn??? 😁
Glad to have three points for Sir Bobby. Many things to improve but celebrate the win
RIP to SBC.. Legend of united..
👍🏼
maybe mctominay should change position to striker ?
remembering Sir Bobby Charlton 🙏🏼 😢
Diago dalot big fan Ronaldo😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 like Ronaldo like dalot celebrate🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Ushawahi sweat haga wewe? 😂😂 Juu weuh
Let's go Manchester united 🇹🇯🇹🇯🇹🇯
We cant play like diss against mancity
What happened to marcus rashfod????
Man uts needs a witcher to get rod of this Hag 😂
why does the commentator sound like he's not allowed to scream or shout, when he reacts to goals? like he's scremaing in a hushed way
Lindelöf has been class so far this season.
Impressed with Lindelof as LB
McTominay should be SS, I don't get it why Ten Hag still place him as DMF.
Manchester United Is very hard to watch sigh.
❤
What a hit son What. A. Hit🤩
Top bins
Another game, goals from non forward players.
Shameless club another yet awful performance from Ten hag and his boys
Rip legends
What a great penalty kick
why not try mctominay as striker instead
GREAT KITS, with white pants & white socks
Dalot Celebration like ronaldo
Let's go united
one goal one error
What kind of highlight video is this😢😢😢.
This the wish version of Mourinho ball
Lindelof not being a waste of space hats off to him
Lindelof on the wings was a revelation.
ggmu
I respect that people rated Maguire higher than all other players in this match❤
Amrabat 🔥🔥🔥
Mayan lah minimal udah lebih baik drpd main nya Persebaya
I like the goal process...GGMU
Amrabat lets cooking ❤
It’s a brilliant scholesy screamer
Hail Sir King  👑  Maguire!
Dalot's celebration like CR7 in Al Nassr..
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Alhamdulillah.. Terbaik Manchester United🙏🙏
Maguire ❤🔥
If I was Rasmus Hojlund,I will leave Man United and Join Man City..😢
lol we actually won😝
2 player of Mouriño
R.i.p Sir Bobby one of the greats

Now we got some shooters... Dalot, Amabrat strike would've easily been Goal of the Month.   But Dalot did it in style ⚡👏 Well-done lads
Did ETH avoid SHF boss? Weird, not like him
in loving memory of Sir Bobby ❤️
Wonderful goals at Manchester United 🌎🙏✅✅✅
Sheffield deserve to win
RIP Sir Bobby Charlton
What a strike from Dalot😎🔥
What a shot from amrabat
We face City next 😬😬
Rest up Sir Bobby❤❤❤ Let's keep grafting guys💪🏿❤🖤❤🖤
Pleas manchester Bruno OUT ... hahaha
No clean sheet again.. Oh Onana 😢
Play like this against City and it ll be 5 0😂😂😂
Its time to use 5 1 2 2 eth.. Dont wasting time.. Hojlund, tominay, dalot now so improve.. And rashford DNA is quick counter. 5 1 2 2 is the best choice for now.
lawan ini aja susah, heran...
Bench Rashford and start playing Garnacho please
uwow
Never give up
For Sir Bobby
Against no clean sheet for Onana onana onana whis is my name why i liked my own comment
why does the commentary sound soo boring
Dalot celebrated like CR7
The attack is still a mess! When can we truly be aggressive on the pitch?
Sack Bobby!!‼️
R.i.p sir Bobby and also Thank you Sheffield United for being class, United til I die
Commentator is 💩💩💩
More of this in the future hopefully, RIP Sir Bobby 🙏🏼
Mc Tom 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. Dalot 🇵🇹

Rashford being selfish again 😒
😊  😊😊
What a strike
McTominay is on form now. What a world we live in.
Rest in Peace for Sir Bobby Charlton I love that we tried to hit more balls from outside penalty box.
We would have score 4 goal but got no luck today.
❤❤
Mc Tominay should be a striker
No clean sheet??? Have a goalkeeper or not
Nice goal from diogo dalot
❤
onana napa masih dimainin aja sihhhh
Rip Sir Bobby Charlton.
R.I.P  to our best greatest player Bobby Charlton😢
Absolute beauty of a goal from Dalot!!!!!
nice one.......win is a win......3 points all that matters!
We got a striker named number 39😂
Love you Manchester united ❤❤
Yang penting terus menang
United é uma Bosta
Glory glory Man United and Sir Alex Ferguson forever. Greetings from Leicester.
Maguire did an excellent job ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No Bruno n rasford next game Onana is the best
Congrats on the win and RIP Bobby Charlton.
PGMOL 💩
We love you Amrabat, good job
When Rashford seemed to just take a walk every match, what a waste of time, better give his position to Garnacho
2018 world cup Maguire is back !
glory united
Where is 75 m  ???
Glazers out!
New striker? 😅😅
Rip man united legend
This is a fake Juventus kit from China😂
I love this club bad boy agosh❤❤❤❤❤❤ manu this club i dont care how much time they lose its my club 🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
Poor performance. No identity of how the team wants to perform. Team gives away ball too easily.
Freedom for Palestine 🇵🇸  MANU forever ❤️👹
We played crap but we got a win with a Bobby Charlton type goal,I'll settle for that.
Rip❤
Another penalty awarded unfairly against us😂
The most weakest team in united history
👍💪
we've seen better man utd, but the point is that, although it's difficult, we still have the victory against a second-class team...
hate the commentator so much, there is no euforia for united's goal, even for spectaculler goal,   can you go away for me? pleaseee
Penaldes useless as always 🤡🤡🤡
Need more clean
Sir Bobby Charlton.... RIP the greatest English Football player
❤❤❤
still win is a win! keep fighting ManUtd! Maguire best player of the match!💪
Onana onana
Yanited won? BORING...
This team really needs to upgrade
rip legend.
m rashford..kamu pemain hebat tapi mentalmu tempe...kamu harus menanamkan fikiran kamu lawan kamu seperti anak anak kecil..dan pelatihmu adalah ayahmu..
Cakep Goal Dalet 😎🔴⚪⚫
just put mctominay as striker lol
Rest in piece legend, never liked united but it always sucks when a football legend passes away...
I hope you maintain your game. Don't let your winning mentality fluctuate
Nk ora klebon pora iso ndot bendot
MU is now nothing more than a bunch of selfish young clowns. (except casemiro)
love Man United
Another game another win what a performance legendary duo defenders
Why ETH never shook hands with Sheffield United’s Manager. Was there a quarrel between them?
And that’s why we adore this game ❤
BOOT
A perfect tribute for the legend
💪
rise red devils😈😈
Maguire is the GOAT!
❤
MU tunjukan tandukmu
Never been a fan of Maguire, but fans need to stop giving him stick, he's a starter for Utd when he's confident in himself
GGMU
win
No clean sheet again for onana 😅
bruno really has an annoying face  bruno’s face is really annoying  annoying is the face of bruno
Sir Bobby ❤️
this is a sign of m.u rise, will definitely win champions trophy  🔥
Onana still no cleansheet
Maguire is comeback. He is very this match.
GG MU🔥🔥🎉🎉
Hojlund lack of ball supply from the right and left lines
GGMU 1878👏👏👏🤩🤩🤩
We still need to do better but I'm happy we won especially today of all days
i dont know whats more uglier. the owners, the way we play or these green jackets/jerseys.
Lord
This victory is for Sir Bobby Charlton
ใส่ชุด ทุเรศมากแมนยู
Enjoy this win because the next few games unlikely to win. Ten fraud will be exposed again.
Salute Sir Bobby Charlton.
R.I.P. Sir Bobby Charlton 💔
Harry Mags the redemption arc.
What a goal dalot 😂🤗🤗🫡🫣👏👏👏
mctominay on fire
United we stand united forever ❤😈
مرعب مانشيستر تغيير توه هدف

Dr permainan blum memuaskan
Maguire deserves more credit
تغيير توه هدف

Dalot still has it, wan bissaka could start as a cb!
How come we were not given the penalty when we were against Tottenham... It's the same handball...
Sir bobby rather go to heaven than to watch man utd performance.
Even Ronaldo Will Be Envious of Dalot’s SCREAMER 💨💨💨💨💨💨💨⚽️💥
Ugly win😂
Scot❤
🔥🔥🔥
Ten Hag is not going to last beyond January. The team looks completely disinterested in football and he himself looks like he wants to get the F out of there.
Boby Charlton ❤️❤️
Maguire much better now.. hope he consistently likes this match…
Why Always Tomicnay?
RIP sir Bobby. Glad for the win. Maguire showing his true colors as usual almost cost us the game. It's like he's powered by British Xenophobia. Sorry to see Evans injured
were going to be hammered by city
dalot fantastic goal...
Not a screamer really but a beautifully curved shot
Dogshit game.
Anyone else notice how Ten Hag seemed to be evading the opposition manager?
United gat defenders scoring 😂
in this game Maguire is the beast
RIP Bobby / Free Palestine
Congs MANCHESTER UNITED
Diogo!!! 🔥
Hard game vs team position 20 😅 big joke
Put maguire in the starting lineups against man city then he can defend hallend
We were wasteful, created big chances but not many. I think if either Hojlund, Bruno, Amrabat, Rashford, or Garnacho scored the big chances we had maybe it would've been a whole different mood  and conversation. But also important that we won as a fitting tribute to Sir Bobby Charlton. ❤️
No clean sheet
you should put onana 2 great saves to stop utd fans bullying him
🐀 🐁 🐭 🐀 JIM GLAZERS OUTTTTT QATARI INNNNNNN
Rip sir Bobby😭
Superb
Harry Maguire’s game by numbers vs. Sheffield United:  104 touches 82% pass accuracy 76/93 passes completed 13/17 long balls completed 5/7 aerial duels won 3 clearances 3 blocks  Player of the match.😮‍💨  YANITED
Newcastle had them humbled 8-0 in this very stadium!!
The woodwork was all blades today.
McTominay should duet with Hojlund on the attacking's side.
Give bayindir a chance to play lol
Did ETG shake the opposing coach's hand?
Man Utd haven't had a convincing win so far this season apart from against Crystal Palace in the caraboa Cup. Well it's better than drawing or losing.
our neighbors Manchester United had to lose this match
Some fans said beating the bottom league Man U were worst..but if they lost fans condemned Man U.. Can't satisfied everybody
Smell that?  *Maguire is cooking 🍳*
terima kasih onana. tidak memainkan bola dri bawah lagi ❤
😢RIP ：Sir.Bobby！👑🏆👍👍
Why we scoring first and then conceding lads need to work on that for sure💯💯💯
Rip 💔🥹sir boby
We were doing a cross bad challenge today
R.I.P Sir Bobby Charlton ❤   Legend
Dalot!!! Mantap 🎉🎉🎉
Can you please give an extended highlights??? +
17 wins in 18 starts for Maguire.  He's cooking
That goal is " The Dalot Destroyer ", a goal to sink any ship.
I think we should only push for a Carabao or Fa Cup this season, our play is in shambles...
Tominay score again
Individual brilliance has been the miracle in man united everything else is in shambles 😮
В память о Бобби Чарльтоне 🔥💓 всегда будем помнить этого великого футболиста 20 века 🔥❤️
The fact that all forward player didn't score a goal means this team still struggle. but no matter what, the job to secure 3 points is everything. GGMU..
MANCHESTER UNITED IS RED ❤
Nothing I have is truly mine
Innalillahi wainna ilaihi roji'un Sir Boby Charlton
This one's for Sir Bobby! What a goal by Dalot. Time to carry on this form to the Champions League and against Man City. GGMU ❤
Wasn't the greatest of performances by any means but a win is a win in a day where we lost one of our own a man who was a true icon a truly influential man who did so much for the game. This win was for him & Dalot scoring an absolute screamer a goal worthy to win any game no doubt Sir Bobby would've been proud of that. RIP Sir Bobby you'll never be forgotten. Thank u for everything
I know Dalot saved us today but this dude seriously needs to improve his defending skills, I had minor seizure watching him defended
Amrabat ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amrabat 😳
Maguire is improving a lot 😊
Vamossss United ❤ este un gran paso para ganar todos los títulos posibles en esta temporada
This commentators voice can put a moving train to sleep
RIP sir bobby charlton
Only Onana , Lindelof , dalot , evans , Mctominay,  Amrabat  played well today

Ten hag out
RIP sir Bobby Charlton😢Our legend just pass away from us😢
Amrabet was everywhere
R I P
Onana was solid tonight
onana onana ,one match one goal😂😂
Perfect gift for the late Bobby Charlton
Despite the tight result gotta say that we had some decent individual perfomances today
Sell Andre Onana
As much as I'm buzzing with the 3 points we've needed an absolute worldie from Dalot to beat the worst team in the Premier League a goal of the month from Bruno to beat Burnley the quality of football we've shown has been abysmal to say the least it better change rapidly or it's gonna be a very long season🤣
Marcus Rashford hasn't won a header since Garnacho's woman got pregnant... Glad for the win though
Maguire is back
GGMU ❤
RIP Bob

Ten hag not shaking hand after the game, why tho?
RIP SIR BOBBY.. LEGEND🥀

Amrabat and other midfielders should try those shots from outside the box, you never know what could happen
Wonderfull shot from Dalot
Just like the burnley game we got saved by a great goal, we were not that great today but mctominay is proving to be very helpful
Big ups to us🎉❤🇳🇬
