Patrick Mahomes is the best 👏👏👏
, oh
Man escaped from the Super Bowl as well
He also used escape artist when trying to go to the Superbowl.

10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours. 2. No matter where you go, you're there. 3. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.  4. Honk if you like peace and quiet. 5. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  6. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 7. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 8. I intend to live forever. So far so good.  9. All generalizations are false.   10. What's another word for "thesaurus"?    Editorial: Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Sometimes I like to venture into nature with my positive thoughts and some sugar snap peas. I wander aimlessly as I munch on the juicy peas and let my thoughts roam freely. It's amazing.

He also lost.
Joe burrow was the escape artist that game
Yeah... No holding... None... 0 holding
This is impressive, and ended in a TD.  But Burrow had 2 escapes more impressive then this in the 4th quarter alone.
I have meditation videos you might be like it ❤️❤️❤️
He forgot to equip win ability.
Equipped to fumble.
He reminds me so much of John Elway
Illegal block to the back..god damn he tacked the defensive player..how's a referee miss that call
I think he now has the record for most TD passes in a single post season. I wish he was on my team
https://youtu.be/YIzl-s-mWO8
Cincinnati crushes KC fans! 😭
Yea and that lost him the game
Still wondering how that’s not a block in the back but ok
Bengals: He wasn’t able to escape that loss.
He claims to be blck so he has the incstint to run and scape when white men are trying to catch him .
Didn’t work so well for him today
Patrick Mahomes is a choke artist 😂😂
94 will be haunting him in his sleep
Mahomes lost when he threw the interception and actually the play before the interception should have been caught and returned for a defensive 6 pts
Not tonight 😆
Upset 😂 CryThen..
Is that a D&D reference!
But they lost so it don’t matter
As a Seahawks fan, this looks all too familiar.
Mahomes kiting the bengals like he plays WoW
Funny. I saw him do this multiple times in the last few minutes of the game, and it’s the reason that they were forced to send it to OT for a loss. He gave up so many yards with this. I hate to say it, but they deserved the loss after that.
nice
Mahomes face priceless!😂
Glad they got rid of block in the back and holding penalties.
Mahomes is now escaping the Super Bowl
Let’s run it back Mahomies….lol
Patrick Mahomes just cost in the game by throwing an interception and running around the backfield I’m losing major yardage with a fumble… He also got the ball first in overtime. Dynasty what dynasty?
Inu
Most overrated, overhyped QB in history. Second is Lamar Jackson.
The way these upsets are rolling we should see bangles and niners at the super bowl
Where are all the chiefs fans at??? 😂😂
Here we go again. Let's hope this ot the Bengals get the win not have chiefs get lucky again
Who won the Kansas City Chiefs game today score on that drive or what
Those two are like Batman and batman. No Robin here.
I’m trying to figure out the headline…
O-line cheating for him, as is tradition
KC going down in flames.  😂
Block in the back tho
But Bengals are coming back.
Yes Mahommes!! Keep it up and beat the Bengals too! ;)
Seems like sucking him off that the commentators are doing isnt doing much good mid way thru 3rd quarter
Show the Bengals high lights to
Love the chiefs
That’s Gronks moves
Easiest way to find the open man. Make them work the defense
Reminds me of Montana to Clark!!!
This Kansas City defense is terrible.
Burrow did a much better escape. Twice
Reminds me of Francis Asbury Tarkenton
Go Bengals for a Saints fan. New teams in the Superbowl
Ru telling me when a defensive lineman goes down you can jump on his back wtf is going on in football
Wow, well delivered
I wonder how many chiefie fans are gonna walk out today after Cincinnati comes back to tie 😂  chiefies and their so called fans are the most pathetic franchise in the NFL .
No  Way Jose
Good stuff
Wow, what moves!!! Touchdown!!!
From a Steelers fan.. LETS GO BENGALS!!! #WHODEY
So we ain't gonn talk about 94 getting blocked in the back not once but twice?
How can you not cover a slow lumbering tight end?
Tied Up like a bow let the chiefs know😔
Let's hope the choke artist ability stays unequipped!!!
Two blatant blocks in the back not called. We all know who the nfl wants to win with Tony Lovelace on commentary 🤣
2 illegal blocks in that play
Go Chiefs
Patrick Mahomes gets so many illegal blocks in the back for him so it’s not even funny… Look at his lineman stuff 94 in the dirt from behind….wtf
On that TD Mahommes reminded me of Fran Tarkenton.
Let's go Bengals
The way he did it is so amazing!
Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Yeah good job refs for not calling the guy getting blocked in the back twice in a row
Reminds me of Fran Tarketen
Kc
I guess it's now OK for OL to jump onto the backs of passrushers?  Mahomes/Andy Reid fan here, but that's a flag.
Less go chiefs for the win
I believe the NFL is rigged, I mean it is a business after all.
Where was the flag for the blocking in the back? Playoffs for the Chiefs clearly is bought and paid for! Ratings not authenticity NFL is dead! Every playoff game the Chiefs have been blatantly helped by the refs!
Bruh these titles are too good
Who Dey!!
Am i the only person who is noticing these missed calls??? like 4 penalties should have been called on the chiefs that weren’t
Black in the back..jeez the officiating is abysmal this game..both sides of the ball
this title lmao
Let's go Bengals
Jesus Christ is the Lord
The NFL is in good hands . Mahomes is the perfect QB for Brady to pass the torch
https://youtu.be/l8vwElExWK8
👍🪓🪓🪓🪓
Is the ref blind? Straight illegal block in the back.
I go CINCINNATI.....steeler fan....
Am i the only one that cant stand the chiefs
I think he now has the record for most TD passes in a single post season. I wish he was on my team 😢 😭
:10 flagrant illegal block in the back.
Not even surprised normal for him to do that 😭😭
If you the Bengals . you cant stop everything. But you have to at least stop something. No pressure. No stop of the run. No stop of the pass and only down 11 at half time
Isn't laying on the other player considered holding these days?
Yeah he's made one good play and everyone keeps playing the same one.
Go Bengals... I'm from buffalo
I like the no call.
No block in the back against Hubbard...O lineman's head was behind him...but nothing to see here...thanks @NFL for letting this crew officiate...Jungle Ball second half!!!
Nomanchen voy a ganar $300 pepe vega Buenos para mi cumpleanos
Easy to do when the Bengals are applying exactly -0% pressure on the QB…. #AlreadyLost
9er got it this time💪🏾
Cmon brrrrr
I just want travis Kelce  to show off them dance moves 💛💜💛
The Magician
The right guard saved the entire play with that block
I don’t get the Mahomes hate and disrespect!
Mahomes is Fran the man on steroids
And people cry its op 😭😂 but they have to understand it's a real thing.
Mahonés will be washed by next year. He will end up like rgiII. Washed
This why a defense gets worn out! This dude runs all over the place and it’s hard to stay with your man
Kelec Hill and Mahomes are a dangerous trio.🏈🏈🎈🎈💞💞👍👍🔥🔥🔥 Go CHIEFS
Stop crying for the Bengirls... They're lucky not to be down 18..
Mahomboy has been the best qb since 2018 without a bs no pi call and being injured with 3 linemen out hed have 3 rings
Love you and your family 👪 Patrick @
i didnt know mahomes was a gnome
P stands for PLAYOFF Mahomes.
Where's the flag
Why don't they ever throw flags on the offensive line. It's clearly holding 75% of the time he scrambles.
This was the best 🙂🗞️🏈
So two block in the back TACKLES later, you’ve got a touchdown!!! Wow!
As the refs let clipping as Kansas throws a touchdown bullshit fixed games
That was amazing.
Block in the back
Bengals still have a a chance to win?
You see, I want the Bengals to win (not a fan), but I understand the Chiefs will most likely win.
Sad officiating, biased,  end of first half,  chefs interference call, ball wasn't even catchable,  well that turned out the way it should. No interference,  but on Bengals players, they got mauled! No calls twice in a row. Do the natives a favor and change your name back to the chefs!
Go Pat
The  bungles🥂 lol
Kansas city Chiefs great job
Yeah it's over. K.C. is gonna run away with this one.
Is this the play  where his O-lineman blocked in the back TWICE?
100 dollars in 5 years its gonna come out that the cheifs spygated there opponents and players use peds and steroids
How the heck did the Bengals make it to the playoffs to begin with, they look like little baby boys playing against grown men..... UGLY!!!!
The guy who runs hi account is definitely a maadden nerd
Bengals fans really thought they were going to the super bowl so close but so far away
Mahomes: takes a breath Nfl: incredible, super human
Any QB in the league is making this play
Yes, mahomes is amazing but the best bit is watching 94 of the Bengals getting mashed twice!
Go Chiefs Go!
Can't stand mahomes
god I hate the Chiefs but they've outclassed the Bengals, it's not even close
Block in the back, block in the back
Who ever is making these titles needs a raise 😂😂
Go chiefs! Let’s go!
Just give him the Lombardi trophy right now
It's unbelievable the agility and vision. MVP
It's a pleasure to watch Mahomes.
Am I the only one who seen the illegal block in back 😂
Final Prediction: 37 - 22 chiefs win @me
This may go down as one of Mahomes's greatest plays ever.
Crazy he can run around like that and no holding or block in back. Pretty obvious who nfl wants in the sb
blow out!!!.
WOW PAT GO CRAZY...
"nFl tRyiNg tO rElaTe tO gAmErS"
Won't ever see Brady escaping anything when he was playing. Mahomes is the real GOAT
and the bengal think they going to slow down lamar like they did this year and mahomes now did that to them lord but only if grey roman gets fired if not lamar is going to suffer another year which will be sad
Crazy how much holding is going on in this play by the chiefs oline you can't tackle guys from behind
Offensive line tackles defensive linemen from behind and no call seriously?
Game. Is. Over
21 to 3
rooting for the bengals but such a nice throw from mahomes
This is 49ers year
Mahomes is pushing my nfl heroes  Joe Montana  and  Terry  Bradshaw  off the  GOAT  field.  Now he can aim at the throne Qback ---  22 year vet  Tom brady.!!
Awesome Patrick Mahomes and Kelsey and entire KC CHIEFS TEAM❤️ GO KC CHIEFS ❤️DONT LET UP-! EVERY PLAY MATTERS❤️
Dude's literally insane 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why is no one wearing a mask???
Mahomes  is too good man Bengals  have no chance
Only one team showed up to play.
Mahomes is a magician at the quarterback position
A great touch pass! Wow
Bengals playing like high school football
Bills got robbed, it should’ve been us in the AFC game. Instead the Chiefs get a free trip to the Super Bowl. NFL is a joke.
TEAM JESUS 💪 🙏 🕊  PRAISE THE LORD SPREAD THE GOSPEL ACCEPT HIM INTO YOUR HEART FOR ETERNITY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATe JESUS LOVES YOU ❤
I swear every reciver mahomes throws to is at least 5 yards wide open
I quit watchn this game when the no ca took away a td from the Bengals they are good enough not to be cheated for wow lmao enjoy it while it last wont be there long once Reid retires
They call him “Patty the playmaker!”🤔
Ayo I’m sooooo happy
The only player you can’t say the computer is cheating with on Madden when he does some off the wall mess lol
Nice blocks in the back...
Twice he did it
Thinks he’s Russ
Illegal block to the back..god damn he tacked the defensive player..how's a referee miss that call
If Mahomes has a White mother and a Black father why do they say he's Black?
I wonder which is worst: the Seahawks not running it on the one yard line or the falcons blowing their lead?
LETS GOOOO started,/ took offwith brady aswel
Go baby kc
Yea, I think the chiefs got away with a block in the back on KC 65. Watch Cincinnati 94 (Sam Hubbard)
Crazy how Kelce is almost always open when Manholes needs him.
Lets go chiefs ❤🔥
chiefs are so boring to watch
dude isn’t fair
Bengals are pathetic Mahomo gets it easy every single year
Beng’m UP!
Yes
Good job Patrick on that throw BUT, It’s only the second quarter who Dey🧡🖤
Why is this game actually annoying to watch
LET'S GO BANGLES
KYLER DID THE SAME THING AGAINST THE VIKINGS, PJ WALKER DID THE SAME THING WHEN HE THREW THE TD TO TOMMY TREMBLE
*CHIEFS 💪🏆*
Mahomes is just on another level, we’ve never seen a talent like this before.
We know KC going back Mohomes the next Brady we see
How does KC match up against the Niners or Rams for the SB?
Madden controlled it’s rigged lol
Great play
Josh Allen is the real deal
A few minutes ago with 20k+ views
Desean Watson looking like really. Thats what you call an escape artist
Did anyone else see the blatant block in the back 🤔
Dudes lineman’s have 99 awareness
His 2nd superbowl is already here…..the new era is not #8 but #15. He is beyond being called a new tom brady or joe montana. He is just patrick mahomes
the chemistry is crazy!
Illegal block in the back
He reminds me so much of John Elway. Lol.. 😂 ..MaHomes scrambles around and escapes sacks just like him!! Lol
Imagine it hurts even more for Bills fans if KC destroys them.
That was one hell of a play.
Love that guy but he is still going to loose
Good game though much respect
Seems like San Francisco and Kansas City will be in the super bowl again
NFL wants Patrick Mahomes to beat Brady's 7 SB record so badly 😂
The Bengals defense is just.....bad
As Yourrage would say….He tore that n*gga ASUNDER!!!!
I mean he wasn’t even touched
God he did it again. He just takes my breath away
Let’s ignore the multiple holds not called on the OL
People think I don’t know anything when I say Mahommes scores touchdowns and burrow settles for field goals. End score will be chiefs five touchdowns, bengals five field goals.
So we not going to say anything bout the block in the back for the lineman on the ground
How do you do even do this?
Threw a dart 🎯
They gonna win again
Good game the next Brady only Mahoney.
Chiefs goin to sb!
Block in the back!!
He got it form his brother.
He is like magic 🪄
My goodness . Patrick Mahomes is just an absolute video game , like he finds these amazing ways to get his guys open, just UNBELIEVABLE
Lol
broooo
Um, how many blocks in the back are you allowed to make without a flag exactly?
Nooooo
Mahommes 9/10 115 Yards 2 TDs  so far. 😤 .That dude is an absolute beast and he's focused on getting that 2nd SB Ring and SB MVP.
Madden is a bad game all around
😂
Second
LETS GOO CHIEFS
