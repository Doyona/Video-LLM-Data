JENNIE ATE!!1
I love you guys
Chuck Arnold, New York Post said this about Blackpink. "Doing “Pink Venom” — from their upcoming second album “Born Pink,” due Sept. 16 — the K-pop girl group underwhelmed in their debut performance on a US awards show. It was bad enough that many in the audience — both in the Prudential Center and around the country watching — probably didn’t know the song, but the stiff, lifeless performance failed to establish the group as a live force to be reckoned with on the VMAs stage". He knows nothing about music. Maybe he does not like Asians.
I love the song of Pink Venom it's so fire and cool
OK BUT WHY HAVENT YALL REACTED TO HYOLYN LAYIN LOW
React to their VMA PERFORMANCE OMG. We would appreciate it.
Blackpink ❌ Copypink ✅
LMAO 5 minutes wasted only bc of the rap part🥱
The "kick in the door" is a nod to notorious big; i forgot what song but there's a lot of 90s hip hop references in this video (aaliyah, tlc, run dmc, ll cool j to name a few).
Enjoyed your rxns!
Why dose the door keep on opening 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The more I hear Black Venom I regret saying Ready for Love was better. But they are both good in their own ways 😭 and you guys have the right reactions XD  Also I’m glad to see more Jisoo 💕🧎🏻‍♀️
Just checked, they're now the ELEVENTH most subscribed YT channel, of ALL channels, globally!  The ladies, and their team, work so hard, it's well earned!
al m3za w9lt yl sod <3
Goshhh they pause so many times it's agravatinggggg
“BLACKPINK is the revolution” they don’t say that for no reason 😭
They will perform it live at the VMA's!!!!!!!
So y’all just not gon react to hyolyns newer music 💀
Taste that pink venom haters 👀 Please react to mirae, they just debuted last year and are worth more hype!  kard- Ring the alarm! Is sooo good!!
See, I feel like Pink Venom gets better and better the more you listen to it whereas How You Like That got real old real fast
JENNIE PERFECT
JENNIE THE BEST
JENNIE QUEEN
JENNIE The Best main rapper the best lead vocal the best dancer the best visual ACE OF KPOP
It is Jisoo in the beginning.
they need to react to the dance practice!!!!
Lisa Jennie best rappp🔥🔥🔥🔥

Jennie 🫦
I had the same reaction with Jennie and Lisa’s rap it’s always 🔥
Если на русском что они говорят эти двое,  на акцент смеются?
ENHYPEN'S PARADOXXX INVASION IS LIT TOO! REACT TO IT PLEASEEE !
REACT TO ENHYPEN'S PARADOXXX INVASIONNNNN PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Reaction stray kids thunderous please
JenLisa Chaesoo QUEENS
Lisa and Jennie did great with biggie and Tupac lyrics
what's the name of that drama ?? O:
JENNIE ATE🔥🔥❤️
I need yall to react to BLACKPINK AND BTS MASH UP songs 🚨🚨🚨I swear if they really mash up?? World extinction
Jenny &Lisa rap together is the best. Don’t argue, you must accept that they look good together when they rap together.😎😎😎
Kenapa pikiran saya selalu negatif pas nonton antar Ras ini 🥴
Lisaaa❤
that is jisoo in the beginning of the mv 😭😭
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ리액션 쩌네
I need a reaction to a presentation of Pink Venom 😩🤙
두분의 리액션 너무 재미있네요
Dude “stop, drop” with Jisoo and Rosé together got me
JENNIE SERIOUSLY ATE!
I am a HUGE fan of BP.  I LOVE this!!  I wish BP was with a different company though.  I feel like their company has done them SO wrong.  They should be putting out music all the time and should be selling out concert venues around the world.  The company doesn’t “sell/advertise” them like they deserve.  JMO 🤷🏼‍♀️
😂👍✔
the power of the main rapper jennie
Jisoo ❤️
Y’all pause to much
Jisoo and rosè ateee
Can I say something? I really don’t like this kind of  reaction videos where you PAUSE AND PAUSE AND PAUSE the videos. What’s the point ?? Can you just see the WHOLE video first then watch it again for the second time and that’s the time you should give comments about it? Dude, you just repeat a scene two to three times at least. It feels like you already saw it coz you knew where to pause and pretending to be amaze like its first time for you.
all the hiphop and r&b samples fits well together! hope you guys can dissect it it’ll be so cool
You need to listen to black swan fatou new song
Wtf it’s impossible to watch a MV with you lmao you pause the video every 5 seconds💀💀
the intro is jisoo actually!!
You two are so cute, I love how they react
Было интересно, очень и очень понравился клип и ваша реакция на него, спасибо вам. (люблю всех участниц BLACKPINK без исключения, каждая уникальна по своему и чарует нас своими навыками, умениями и прекрасными образами) странно здесь писать на своём языке, так как здесь большинство комментариев на английском) хэх
Haters should watch this reaction. See blackpink delivers. Biggest GG
📕 The musical references of Pink Venom. = 😋 Jennie starts out with a reference to Biggie’s famous line “Kick in the door, wavin 44” (Jennie says Coco) 🥳 Next Lisa references Rhianna’s “Pon de Replay” with “One by one then two by two” 🤑 And also 50 Cent’s P.I.M.P. with “You couldn’t get a dollar outta me”. 🥰 Rose and Jisoo both reference Taylor Swift with “Look what you made us do”. 😎 Finally, the Jennie and Lisa rap verse is backed by a sample of Ice Cube / Easy-E’s part of “Gangster Gangster” by N.W.A
You are absolutely correct, I would FASHO faint at their concert. AHHHHhhHHhhh
That actually was Jisoo at the beginning! She spent some time with an instructor for the instrument, at the last minute as the producer wanted that shot suddenly~ apparently she's a great student!
That's why it's a must for Main Rapper Jennie to comeback. As always, Jennie's flow is my kind of vibe 😍❤️. Her ability to adjust depending on the genre of the song is astounding. Main Rapper things 🔥💯 She spitting bars.
I like lisa dance ideas 💅🏻💅🏻
Jenlisaaaa...❤️😭
LALISA 🔥👑
I love blackpink and i was so hyped for this comeback but i am very disappointed. After giving us bops like lovesick girls, i just can't believe that this is what they came up with. Like the chorus sucks, it sounds like a part from a nursery rhyme and the jenlisa rap just irritated me because i couldn't even grasp what they were trying to say. The pre chorus was good and the mv production was also good but song wise, it's just a 2 for me *This is my opinion and i am not saying that they are not good or something. They are amazing idols but this song is just absolute trash. I can't believe i waited almost 2 years for this
Lous(dead pan): please light up a candle😭😭😭☠️she always on that throne!  Ous:wait a second you know what yo powa do to me!😭😭😭
Why is no one talking about Rose’ and Jisoo they ate! Their vocals were amazing!
No.1 on global Spotify 2 days in a row. First ever by kpop act.!
I really want a sub unit jenlisa
yall funny asl 😭😭😭😭
THEYRE GONNA PERFORM THIS ON VMAS. ITS CRAZY
CANT WAIT FOR THE TT!! hopefully it’s even better
I personally didn’t enjoy this song that much. The pre-chorus did not match up with the instruments, and overall, it felt rather chaotic to me. No hate, or anything tho, Blackpink is still an amazing group and I can’t wait for their next song!!!
Wrote this with them! I’ll see them in their home country in 2025!
Although HYLT is my fav I think PV will give us their best performances but idk
6:12 SAAAAME
THEY AAAATEEEEEE
******As far a Sexiness goes, Black Pink  Couldn't Pack Rihanna's Lunch! Even as far back as "Rude Boy."
Weee NEED LUMINOUS ON TASTE OF CULTURE
Main rapper jennie bck 😍🔥
Vous parlez trop
Jenny 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You seemed to appreciate their rap but I'm surprised you didn't recognize that Jennie's first line is from Biggie - Kick in the door.
LISAAA💋❤❤❤❤
When I checked reddit, some of them criticized the rap part of JenLisa saying that they are just words. WELL F*CK THEM!!! The reactions of people who have knowledge in the 80’s and 90’s rap culture are phenomenal! They said JenKim ate it and did a great job. It’s the same reaction as with this video! I love it!!!
Lisa. Number  1
Jennie stole the show with her verse no wonder why they don’t let mu girl rap
Jennie ate and left no crumbs on that platr
Fanboy jenlisa😎
9:53-11.35 natural comedian LOL
And this is just a pre-release too !!
Finally someone recognized Jennie's rap part!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Bro. Jenlisa together on screen are incredible. I missed main rapper Jennie so much. LOVE her voice and flow 🥰
Lisa ia such a good and talentel ieol. She can do different flows in her rap and her vocals is fire
fatou just dropped a mixtape you should check it out
Hilarious reaction😂😂
Yoo dude i fuckin love u'r reaction kinda hilarious and funny 🔥😂
Jennie needs more rap lines her flow is amazing.
Jennie devoured this sht
At the beginning. Yeah she is Jisoo
This ain’t even the TT this is a side track the real comeback is next month!!!
vmas on the 28th next sunday on mtv there gonna perform this song
and its is jisoo in the Beginning playing the korean isturament
Jennie's rap is similar to Eminem's
For the 1st time in BP history, Lisa was finally allowed to fulfill her 3 roles—main dancer, lead rapper and sub-vocalist. Such an ace—a triple threat!   But I’ve yet to see YT reactors actually acknowledging that… LMAO.
Note: JISOO is a Vampire and the things beside her are her collections from different centuries🥀🧛🏻‍♀️. You can watch their behind the scenes
No doubt guys I'm 58 and this is awesome.
Jennie main rapper 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How can a song be so boring and cringe at the same time?
Jenlisa rap 😍🖤💗
Anything for thr views
Lisaaaaaa👑🔥🔥🖤
Of course it’s the Military Grade La Tatata.
You know what Lisa style reminded me ? Left eye- TLC
The chorus is sooo addicting like ooohhh my freaking gosh!!!!
Can't get over with Lisa ohhhh my god!!!!
Ratatata Ratatata Ratatata
What’s that show in the beginning??
Blackpink rules!!!
Lisa was insane in this. She literally changed with the confidence in her voice in the intro to the slightly softer and sexy in chorus and came in spitting her rap with Jennie. I really love the diff tone she did from Jennie in the chorus. She brought her A game in rap, dance and vocal. Wow! All of them literally went to another level this comeback
JENNIE ACE
That was jisoo playing the instrument lol
Boring song
No one is pointing out all the references of this song. They had a Nas reference, Biggie smalls reference and Rihanna reference, and Lisa rapped about Rambo which takes me back to the early days of BP lol like whatttttt this was amazing
Umm I just want to say that jisoo is the one playing the traditional Korean instrument oh and I love your videos by the way 😄
i love your reactions bro
In the beginning it's jisoo with the traditional instrument
If I'm right Lisa is one of Celine's ambassador
Can't wait for their concert!!! I'm excited already
파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !  !파이파이팅팅  !파이팅 ! !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !  !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !  !파파이팅이팅    !  !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !  !파이팅파이팅  !파이 !파이팅 팅  파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !  !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅  !파이팅
love the little rihanna bit. one by one, two by two! so good.
the rap is cuestionable..
The Korean toroidal intermittent is in the begint
Jennie ate in this comeback
thats why they should follow their positions and do what they are best at,  rappers rap and vocalists sing. the rapping is killing both LISA AND JENNIE and the vocals of  Jisoo and Rose are amazing.
They’re gonna perform at the MTV VMA’s August 28
jennie's rap verse killed me right there😭🔥🔥
I can’t wait to see BLACKPINK preform this song live too! Everyone’s for sure gonna go crazy or faint lol 😂
The chorus n jenlisa rap specially Jennie literally ate her verses❤️❤️
Main Rapper Jennie making a comeback ❤️🔥
MILITARY GRADE!  lol you guys are killing me
LOL they totally lost it at Jennie and Lisa's verse.  These guys are entertaining XD
This their worst song “ str8 to ya dome like woa woa woa , str8 to ya dome like ah ah ah “ wtf so my hammer and vanilla ice
Fact. Everything on point. Thanks for your reaction. Such a great moment after 2 years when they comeback
Yall need to be demonetized for stealing others content.
LISA DEVOURED 🥵🔥
Lisa wow
That is Jisoo playing the instrument. :) And I loved it.  I don't know that's it's my favorite song from them but it's kind of up there.  (I'm a "Kill This Love" kind of person myself)
Love lisaaa
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🔴🟥
Lisa💗💗💗💗
Another pedophile cringe video? Wack! (And sooo, 'me too').
visuals amazing, music todays pop,  lryics no meaning...a song someone forgets after a month...belive we'll get served with album, they must have something special on it
Jennie💯 being the Main Rapper for a reason🙌🏻 Her iconic speedy savage rap flows lets ppl reminds of female’s Eminem. She’s on Fire🔥🔥
Omg MAIN RAPPER JENNIE KIM returns EVERY time she RAPEA has a new version and surprises us more and more God has shown us that she is an ACE up her sleeve all of blackpink are queens of K-POP 💋💋💋🔥
‘We went from Dudu du du du to rumpum pum pum’   These two kill me 😂😅
Jisoo and Rosè ate brooooo
The Biggie and Rihanna referrence, homage to west coast, and Jennie's Manchester united shirt? WE.FUCKING.WON biches 😭

Loooove them but this hit way different than how you like that to me. This was wiiiiiiiild
BLACKPINK IS THE REVOLUTION
Naaah i swear I think I'm the only one who doesn't like the chorus... and even the end 💀

this is only the b side imagine what their comeback song will be like
Jennie devoured this whole song🔥  Main rapper is back! Lisa telling the world why she’s the main dancer. Rosé’s normal voice is an eargasm🔥 Jisoo’s visual and deep voice are on a whole different level🔥
I subscribed automatically when I enjoyed the reaction video ☺️and  I enjoy this  hype 💯
Where can I watch behind the scenes of "the taste of culture" ??
It feels new but it also feels familiar. You know that feeling? They all slayed in this! JENLISA THE POWER DUO!!! 🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪

Jennie carried the song
JenLisa's Rap & ChaeSoo's Vocal + OT4's Dance ❤️❤️❤️
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 반응이 찐이다🖤💗
BLACKPINK NEVER MISSSSS💯
OA
Jennie QueenI said everything❤️‍🔥
Lisa's voice of pink venom is so suit of her and her vocal is so good and her rap is so insane her aura is everything she's so addictive Slayy Lisa🔥😩
I love y'alls energy 😂🔥
I love this song tho. It's definitely Lisa and Jennie's ERA. They opened the song, they are in charge with CHORUS, followed by their iconic RAP PARTS as well as OUTRO.
Could have been better but all Ik this one wasn’t rlly there best but is something since they haven’t release anything
Everyone looks 💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jenlisa is so iconic and I’m glad they made a return for this comeback. I personally rate it 8.5/10. It’s a high class bp comeback for sure , I just personally think that AIIYL, HYLT or LSGs are still my favorite comebacks and I don’t see this song changing that. But the comeback was solid. Jennie and jisoo owned this comeback imo. All four did incredible and they slayed, i don’t even have to say this bc it’s obvious the girls all did fantastic. I just enjoyed jisoo in the visuals and her laid back cold energy as she sang her parts and showed off, and I think Jennie killed her verses/delivery and she had the angry grit that stood out. I really do feel like the girls came through. And I was loving Lisa with her verses and rosé had me on the floor with her hair and jamming with the guitar. Ofc I loved all the fits, visuals and energy. The choreo was fun and I’m looking foward to the practice for it. I did have one complaint being that I do feel like in lines, i did find myself looking a lot for the vocal line and felt we didn’t get enough of them. But overall I really enjoyed it and think this was a well made comeback 😊. Edit- I just realized how long my comment was lol.
Definitely jennie's era. 💥👌
fast rap ≠ good rap. lisa absolutely slayed her part. the swag that she have.. anywayyy bye
Jenlisa rap is iconic 🔥
They are referencing soooo much here and can't deny they are doing a 90s rap throwback (jenlisa rap) and is super pop culture influenced.  Rihanna's Pon De Replay Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do Notorious B.I.G's Kick The Door Eddie from the Stranger Thing
You guys are so reallll😭
lisa rap is cringe
its s o bad
Blackpink concert in LA is gonna be on November 19 💗💗💗
Man you forgot fatou of blackswan her mixtape ! i can't wait to see your vidéo react
Best reaction video so far 👍
สวัสดีครับ/คอมเม้นท์จากประเทศไทย/ขอบคุณจากใจที่ทำรีแอคชั่นคลิปนี้ให้ชมครับ/ผมชื่นชมยูทูปเบอร์ทุกคนที่ตั้งใจทำคลิปสนับสนุน Blackpink/ดนตรี K-POP มิตรภาพที่ดีไร้พรมแดน  Sa-wad-dee-Boon-rak-sa(สวัสดีบุญรักษา)
DDDD is a revolver, HYLT is either a bazooka or Rocket Launcher. Whistle is a probably an ICBM and Boombayah goes Brrr machine gun and Pink Venom is an auto handgun.
I’ve been screaming straight to ya dome all day!!!! 😂 can y’all please react to PSY and Jessi’s song Ganji please
You guys always crack me up 😂😂😂
Finally they let MAIN RAPPER JENNIE RAP 😭
Lisa &Jennie is like Kane and Son.They go with pairs.
Thank you for your reaction. I love LISA🥰
This is an all time Jennie moment i fear
Come on Lisa with the Rihanna references!! Pon De Replay LALISA!
.
Blinks Remember to stream the OFFICIAL video to support the girls in this comeback // share 💗
찰지시네
i like it
Main rapper  queen jennie finaly back  Jenlisa perfect, rose and jiso wonderful  I loved the last la tata latara part of Jennie
Lisa!  She was too carried away.  Omg I like to listen to the baby's glittering voice, the rap part is the best to listen to.  I feel sorry for Lisa who was treated unfairly during the short rap part.  Even if YG keeps her down, she's still shining bright, you guys are YG scumbags
jennie ate
😅🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥👑
Lisa is the most versatile idol from her singing prowess to an amazing rapping to her energetic dancing. SHE ATE EVERYONE UP
HE HAD THAT CANDLE READDDYY 😂💯
The song is disappointing
Please react to fatou 1mixtape PWAPF
MADLY IN LOVE WITH LISA: RAP, DANCE, VOCALS, BEAUTY
LISA THE QUEEN OF RAP! A TRUE RAPSTAR
Yes broh JENNIE ACE
assisteeeeeeeeeeeee para de pausar
It just only the intro but JENNIE give us goosebumps when she started the song.
Jisoo killed
Guys react to new jeans pleans (all the versions of Hype boy and attention)!!!! PLEASE react!!!
Please react to devita eat your heart out and bonnie & Clyde her voice is really amazing 🤩
The critics of this comeback are all like, BLACKPINK ARE BEING EXACTLY LIKE BLACKPINK ! What is up with that?
Rapper Jennie always leaves me speechless. This was DDD iconic.
This has to remind that if people doubt about jennie main rapper position its just because she doesnt get enough rap lines
When Lisa opens the lift type doors inside the tomb (?) there is a large metallic looking dead (or dormant) tree. Cut back to the MV for Whistle and around 39 secs in, Jisoo and Lisa are guarding a small tree in a pot, that is shedding its leaves. Later in the MV they are even sleeping next to it. Some suggested at the time it was an apple tree.  Cut back to now and Lisa is eating a black/pink apple... It's the same tree dude, the one they have nurtured since their debut... Tree of wisdom, tree of knowledge, tree of creative rebirth... Bearing the fruits of their labour... And they have built a pyramid shaped temple around this thing! Boom. That's what we call a payoff across every MV they've made. Temples, trees, forests, basement vaults full of cool stuff, clocks, ruined temples, chandeliers... There is a BLACKPINK world and we don't live there... Even if we are lucky enough to be granted glimpses into it from time to time...
JenLisa rap was great, but I loooved that Rose and Jisoo back to back build up, they killed! Every time Rose sings "I'm so rock and roll" I get goosebumps.
The choreography, the vocals, rap lines, and visual effects…I don’t understand why so many people are hating on this.
Lisa's first rap lines sounds like Pom de Replay of Rihanna
you forgot doon-doon-doon-do-do-doon from how you like that lmao.
the song was garbage don't cap
ESQ LISA WOOW SE LLEVA TODA LA ATENCIÓN
It’s definitely Jennie’s era indeed
Im surprised you didnt mention Jennie with her Man utd jersey 6:20
Jenlisa rap is sooo good ,I get my tongue tied up like a tongue twister.
Lisa is my bias and one of my favorite rappers of all time, but there's a reason Main Rapper Jennie is always talked about by the fandom. Jennie's a fucking *monster* when rapping, absolutely unbeatable.
Can y'all plz🙏🏽react to Fatou's mixtape there are 3 songs in total
You guys should check READY FOR LOVE by BLACKPINK too with collaboration with PUBG MOBILE💗💗💗
That was jisoo in the beginning
Jennie said ‘y’all been wanting me to rap… imma rap’ and then proceeded to kill us 🔥
Lisa🔥🔥🔥
JENIEEEEEE ATE ATEE ATEEEEEEEEEE
“Reaction videos” more like “I don’t have any original ideas, so here is my talentless self watching the Internet”
THEY ALL BODIED THIS CHOREOGRAPHY JENLISA HOTTEST RAPS SWAGGERS AND CHAESOO HARMONIZES VOCALS WAS HOT ASF THEY ALL SLAYY WHAT YOU WANNA SAY 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jennie reminded y'all who the MAIN rapper is today lol
Main rapper queen Jennie finally back 😭🔥 She is totally slayed this 🥵👑
JISSO + ROSE VISUAL IS CRAZY ASF
I love the video but song didn’t do it for me. I feel like they aren’t growing and the music just sounds the same.
Jennie really ate the rap part
They are going to the vmas

I cannot !!  And I mean CANNOT wait for them to perform at the vmas on Sunday
To be honest I was never a person to listen to Black Pink and this is my first ever video watching by them. THEY ARE FRICKEN AMAZING!!😍😍I've been totally missing out and am watching 'How you like that' now🤩THEY REALLY OUT DID THEMSELVES. THEY ARE SO GOURGEOUS, AMAZING AND LEDGENDS!!! YOU GO BLACK PINK!!
its so bad T-T
😂🤣😂🤣😂 You guys are funny 🥰
I don't know why jisoo and rosé don't get more lines than jennie and Lisa they always get so many lines more than jisoo and rosé 🥺
Taste the venom people!!!
ROSÉ AND JISOO ATE
This video is not the comeback yet but they just ate, so we must have to waiting for the biggest comeback by blackpink !!!!!!
Jennie best rapper
Lisa calm down 😂 you're sooo 🔥🔥🔥
Please react to ptt by loona!
1:39 That is Jisoo 😂
1 by one, even 2 by 2, everybody in the club be rockin with you.. The verse they gave Lisa at the start sounds like Rihanna’s Pon de replay song.
KEEP STREAMING BLINKSSSS WE HAVE EACHOTHERS BACKSSSS 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💗💗💗💗💗
i thought his going to drink the candle😂
YES JENNIE ATE
ik how you like that and ddu-du-ddu-du as well as the rest of their songs are mostly strong and showcases power but man never in my life seen vocalists being so fierce and dangerous ik jenlisa are usually representing black and chaesoo are pink but this whole song screamed black although it’s about a pink venom
What Jisoo plays at the beginning of the MV~ is Korean traditional instrument "GEOMUNGO"".🔥🔥🟢🟢 It's AWESOME SOUNDS !!~~🤩🤩
Please buy pink venom on us iTunes if you haven't yet 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
JENNIE QUEEN🔥🔥🔥
Jisoo is actually the one playing the instrument
he's right how you like that is better
Jennie rap line, because she travelled on private jet to event and the media gone crazy 🤪
Jennie's rap🥵🥵🔥
❤️❤️❤️
Lisa killing it as always!!! I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I missed hearing her sing too.
Jisoo perfecttt🛐❤️
I screen recorded the WHOLE premiere cuz I  just knew it was gone be heat 🔥😌
Lisa’s verse @ 2:10 has that ‘Pon De Replay’ by Rihanna flow
Jisoo killed it I'm so proud!! Rosé too and Jennie and Lisas Rap Duo was amazing 💕 love this song so much!
it's Lisa's pon de replay verse for me!
can you do more twice reactions please?
jisoo all time best🥰
Good reacción guys
I’m not a big fan of the chorus but I love the visuals, outfits, choreo, percussion, and the raps and vocals
Lisa’s killing every position that she’s put into 🔥🔥
That is jisoo in the beginning
react to chunghas new song!!
I love watching people like you enjoy kpop especially as everyone I know bullies me for enjoying it brings me so much happiness
Guys , you are overreacting🙂👍🏻 😒
BLACKPINK is my EVERYTHING💜💜💜💜
This reaction is fckng hilarious. My favorite so far.
This song is a mess but whatever
THEY SLAYEF AND LEFT NO CRUMBS THE RAP JESUS
Jennie's tone voice while rapping really show's she studied in new zealand
Blackpink! They are amazing!!!! Sooo worth the wait
Lou and Ous, do y'all have a promo code for Seat Geek right now?
Hi Lou and Ous🙋‍♀️☺️💗
ACE LALISA.
Jennie is the main rapper but in blackpink she has not been given that place, just listen to her rapping she steals the show and live she has a lot of power when she does it.
JENNIE MAIN RAPPER IS BACK🔥🔥🔥
It's sad that people are shocked that jennie raps i mean she's the MAIN RAPPER but barely rap. Fck YG
Rap lisa so beautiful 😰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh My Gosh!! U guys are so funny😂 can’t stop laughing.
We need more lili films asa
Jennie literally killed it. proved once again her rapping skills 😩. ACE and Queen indeed 👑
もれなく絶賛してるのが伝わる
Jennie 😍rap is killing me 😍😍
Mmmm love it
jennie's rap slay but the lyrics does not slay 😅😅
It’s good can comments 4 women not one or two?BP have 4 you forget???
Wish I liked it more. I think it was a bit disappointing. Nothing to really make it stand out and the MV didn't reflect the budget. Wish they had a better song for their US award show debut performance.
What I love about Jennie is her versatility when it comes to rapping. Like everything she raps isn't the same flow or like you can't predict how she is gonna rap things. Like you know when u hear a song by an artist and they just sound the same on all their songs.
🔥
Just knew it was about to be heart attack material
JENNIE is The Main Rapper for a Reason 😼
Watch it many times and its so nice, the music is funky perfect!!🫢 music video is 🔥QUEENS ARE BACK❤️
I hate toxic fans. If anyone seen how y'all act no one would want to Stan Blackpink.... a person followers shows the leaders true colors.....
What show were you watching in the beginning?
They always notice things that I never  notice lol
Can I just say how happy I am to have Jennie really rap in a song
TIKTOK BEST RAPPER ALIVE "JENNIE KIM".
this is just JENNIE’s era frfr she’s so dang dopeee!
Jennie vocals are heaven but when she start rapping i lose my mind like wtf
Reminds me of “Kill this Love
I love Jennie's rap
Lisa
Jennie our main rapper is back at the again
I love this guys, their reaction is the same sh1t i feel it
Let's watch reaction later after 24 hours if you are fond of watching those!let's focus on streaming to set records
Whether if it’s something not everyone expected they still ate and gave us everything idc
Lisa❤️‍🔥
I loveee your guys reactions !!! I would love to see you guys react to Test Me by jyp kband, Xdinary Heroes !!!
Jenlisa is real
Shorts fired rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata rattata HARD.
Lisa is so good on rapper but Jennie rap is totally different, her voice is really powerful
Lisa n jennie omaygoyt
Lisa wow wow w o w
โอ้ยพ่อ555555555ดูเอ็มวีไปก็หวีดกันไปน่ารักแท้
Jennie literally proved that she is the Main Rapper ✨
🤯🤯
It is Jennie the main rapper, yo!
pls pls pls pls pls pls pls react to rose vs rosanne
I wonder if anyone heard the Rihanna flow Lisa did in the beginning of the song
Jennie ate and left no crumbs
I love Lisa just as much as they do😅
Lisa 💛💛
Jisoo the best girl
Yeaaaah lisa and Jennie best rapper in kpop and for me lisa is best rapper in the world
She's the main dancer but her rap ..is so lit 🔥 Lisa u killed it
Why so yall pause so damn much jesus
Jennie Rap🥵🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶🥰
Jennie has finally proven to everyone that she is a lead VOCALIST and a main Rapper. I love her as a rapper but her vocals are always on point.
ilove you Lisa
I already said Jennie got really good flow. But because of haters she probably prefers to rap less nowadays but Thankgod she actually clap back to the haters telling who the main Rapper is in the group.
jennie is soo underated
You can choose both. They have differ styles when they rap. Lisa is a swag rapper and Jennie has a darkness when she raps and is a badass. Both are great in their own style.
I mean come on THEY LITERALLY ATE IT ! I MEAN IT'S ICONIC! Maybe cause I'm not still not really used to it I think HYLT is better, but Pink Venom showed them from the new prospective.
It’s literally Jennie’s song she came back and owned it
Lisa is my bias but we are not going to deny that Jennie came back to remind us, who's the main rapper 🤸‍♀️
Anyone else getting G-IDLE vibes???? Lovin this!!
can't wait to see them perform this for the VMAs
Jennie and jisoo ate
EXACTLYYYY!!! MAIN RAPPER JENNIE HITS DIFFERENT!!!
Jennie is the ace for this Pink Venom :))
BLACK BLINKS BEST BLINKSS
Jennie ate everything and left no crumbs
I really hope you guys ho to Korea and get yo visite YG entertainment.
😂😂😂🤣
Jiso and rose soo good
CAN’T WAIT FOR THEM TO PERFORM THIS AT THE VMA’S 🖤💖

What's the K-drama? It looks like an anime I once saw. So I would like to see what a live version of it would look like.
Hahhaa Lisa is always 🔥
JENLISA snatched my soul with their rap parts. Jisoo's beauty is ethereal. Rosé's voice is angelic, we can listen to her all day. This comeback is amazing and insanely good. Their visuals, all gorgeous. BLACKPINK IS THE BEST AND BIGGEST GIRL GROUP. They always slayyyy. Blinks, keep on streaming on every platform. 🖤💗
Amo su reaccion pero el rap de jennie en ingles te vuela la cabeza🤯🤯😍😍
MAIN RAPPER JENNIE IS BACK
PLS REACT TO PARADOXX WITH ENHYPEN
JenLisa bodied this. But genuinely I NEED to see the dance practice for this so bad. Lisa ATE that dance up. Pause on any frame and she’s on POINT.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jennie been the main rapper and well known “the ace” predebut ❤❤❤
best reaction
The people at M Countdown are so lucky😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭
dam Lisa
Lisa's beauty and rap dance vocal all is wtffff
Jennie always bodies the sing when she raps that’s why they don’t let her rap💅 ace princess indeed
PINK VENOM IN YOUR AREA…..la tatatattaa laatatatta
EXACTLY JENNIE ATE THAT VERSE
The intro sample is Nas “Made You Look”
Jennie rapping again like a queen!! Oh my god we missed her rap so much!! Her rap hits different! She totally nailed it! No doubt, Jennie owned this song!!
JENNIE ATE THE SONG AND THE MV
Lisa opening the door this time is in a soft way 🙀
Main rapper Jennie is backkkk
MISS YOU GUYSSSS
All of the girls ate but Jennie thoughh. She bias wrecked me for sure this comeback! She showed everyone who she is! She said don’t forget I’m the main rapper!
This whole vid was EPICC!!!! I LOVE EVERYTHING THING!!! I felt like Lisa & Jennie did a perfect tag team in the rap segment! Lisa flow was really good purposely slow pace, clever how she put a Rambo reference that went crazy, it's like she toss the ball up for Jennie to spike it with her verse!!! I wouldn't be surprise if they wrote their rap verse on the second half of this song!!
all i hear is exaggerated screams, just act normal guys
Lisa 1 2 3 part took me out, everything about that scene was phenomenal
Lisa and Jennie ate itt 🔥🔥
FUNFACT bout the song: - Jennie straight up started the song with some notorious big lyrics references "kickin the door waving the 44" - lisa's "one by one then two by two" references to rihanna's "pon de replay" song - lisa and jennie rap part using the same synth sound with easy e's song "real muthaphukkin g's" - jennie wearing manchester united t-shirt with numbers 96, the years she was born
TO BE HONEST LISA SHINES AND KILL THIS COMEBACK WITH HER RAP, SINGING, OUTFIT STYLE, HER LOOK AND HER DANCE..SHE REALLY GAVE US EVERYTHING IN THIS SONG !
That's jisoo with the musical instrument haha
Fun fact: in Lisa’s first rap part actually interpolated Queen Rihanna’s ‘Pon De Replay’. Queen touching Queen 💅🏼✨
Jennie ate...everyone ate but she ATE the whole meal
The chant is from Nas  “made you look” if y’all remember that song. Teddy really knows what he’s doing when he chooses his samples
Guys, r u realize u totally dressed up like jenlisa in their rap part 😆😆 i mean that is a coincidence
They can have all the views they want. But how far will this song go? It wasn't that impressive and reactors really need to stop saying everything is good
Lisa stands out even in a trashy outfit, now that she receives good outfit she stand out more and more, this legit Queen
tbh , i don't think it's the best come back, but i loveeee the outfits and visuals
You are real blink 💗🖤
Omgggg this is best reaction ever 🥲💖😀
I haven’t seen you both for 2 years! Lol I always anticipate your reaction tho
I agree! BlackPink are my badass girls!
Main rapper Jennie is back 💥💣
This time Jennie rap killed it!!!
Jennie you killed it Gurlll 🔥
Lisaaaaaaaa
Jennie oh my god
"I thought that was Jisoo for a second"  Lemme tell you smtng...
Queens are back.  And jenlisa rap is the best thing I seen all year
It still doesn't have 24 hours of releases, go watch the MV to stream!!!
KIM JENNIE -MAIN RAPPER -LEAD VOCALIST -LEAD DANCER NO ONE CAN TOUCH HER
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love you guys ratatata
thanks for the reaction your two one of my favorites
Y'all make me vibe with this song on a different level
Blackpink is dominating the world far more popular and better than BTS, Justin bieber, Beyonce, Nicky Minaj
honestly this is literally the most genuine reaction for the mv that i've watched so far. you guys are the best
Yes, it was jisoo at the start of the video 😂 JISOO HIT ANOTHER LEVEL ❤️
This reminds me a lot of kill this love, the chorus was a flop tho the rest of the song was good, this one is same chorus is a flop for me. I liked how the began loud and confident but chorus was not hyped at all, average. I d rather prefer something like hylt, chorus was catchy and nice, the rest of song was good, but chorus was better, so I'm down with the verses it has nice rap parts as well as singing parts are both melodically catchy but chorus.. I hoped at least it would have two different parts like in hylt or at least something different. I felt right same way about kill this love. And I'm not going to mention it a lot but it's so like their other titles so it's really getting boring, visuals are nice and all but the structure of the song is just you know what s going to happen next. Rose and jisoo switching parts, prechorus split between rose and jisoo, ending is hyped and loud, not mad about rap parts like in kill this love, it was fine and not so used up. But overall.. visuals probably was the best part and the verses though again nothing really new, very similar to the rest of the production. I mean I guess yes the formula is good and works but it's getting overused, in the beginning they were more diverse, after dududu it feels all the same. May be lovesick girls had a bit of a change, but here we are again. And it's not only blackpink, the hyped loud ending they use almost for every group yg owns,  sometimes it works sometimes it does not, in this case no, it was not the best one as well as it's shot again with a dance break (Idk isn't it clone of dududu, hylt, kill this love ?). I saw the premiere and this is second time and I don't want anymore. Gon be waiting on album release. At least their b sides are diverse
Who can beat this QUEENS my good fellas ? They hiatus for 2 years then comeback ruin every groups record out there 😅  YG's culture, save the last for the best.
Jennie literally ate those verse
9.7 million views and its only been 48 mins 🤗.   Let see how much record can they break.  The 24 hr mark!!  Now its at 48 m within 8 hrs !!  Epic
I just dont understand why if someone praise lisa in the comments, its always the *inserting another person* when you can make another comment. Let people praise lisa in peace pls. You can praise your girl all you want but respect other people's opinion. We all have our fave for a reason. 😩
this new song is ok except the rap that was legendary but other than that it was ok
That new JenLisa rap scene is so reminiscent of the good ol days of Aaliyah, Missy Elliot, Left-Eye (TLC) era. Almost felt like a homage. The nostalgia is soooo real.
Was the a Pon de Replay call out I heard from Lisa?
THATS JISOO INTRO😫💖
The Arabian sounds were nice, but that was the only thing I liked. The chorus was such a disappointment.. and the whole MV was all over the place. And what was up with the sudden 'ratatata' at the end? It made no sense at all. I like most of their other songs, but this was a no. It's weird that this was the most expensive one. All the money went into buying views for the MV I guess. Cause it's blowing up for some reason.. 👀 their last song Ready for love now has 69 million in 3 weeks. How are they at almost 47 in 8 hours with this terrible song? 👀 no hate, it's just weird to me.
Y'ALL PLEASE REACT TO DJ ROOTS- BABY!!!! IT'S SUCH A BOP
It’s so amazing!! Jisoo really owns this era for me and not because she’s my bias lol. But they all slayed!!!
LISA SERVING VOCALS..... ACE AND OWNER OF THE ERA
HAHAHAHA the last part reaction 🤣🤣🤣 From ddu ddu ddu to rapapampam to ratatata 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HAHAHAHA the last part reaction 🤣🤣🤣 From ddu ddu ddu to rapapampam to ratatata 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
10:15 Y'know how Lisa got someone to poison the masks filter in lilifilm the movie?
Sorry this song is not doing them justice.  They are to talented for this to be the best they can give them. Yes they look beautiful but why are they giving them these out dated songs. If this came out like 4 years ago it'd be good but naw not now. It's a waste of their talented and shows no growth wish the label wouldn't box them in.
I love u guy reactions so much .is so funny it make me laugh all days Love from❤❤Dakar
It's so fun watching you guys 😀
Lisa!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Lisa🥵🥵🥵
дженнин рэп🛐👑💗😩
Been a fan of Blackpink since day 1 and this gotta be the only kpop group that I could never have a favorite. This comeback killed it.
MAIN RAPPER JENNIE IS BACKKK
I must say that this is Jenlisa's era. But for me and most of my friend agree that the most stood out is Lisa ( we watch it together at work haha ). She played all her role which is main dancer, lead rapper and sub-vocalist.  I remember back in trainee's day she was the only member that gotten straight A+. Also, we were kinda shock to see her glow up visual and for her to sing at the chorus part with that kind of voice which is really new to heard. Her voice is so soft, btw she is currently trending #1 in my country.  And she is also trending #1 worldwide showing her impact is really amazing.
The instrument Jisoo was playing at the beginning is a korean traditional geomungo.
This MV is serving us FULL COURSE ❤‍🔥 That opening is Jisoo playing the instrument (there's a pic of her & her teacher online) 'Designer crimes' Lisa throw shade on her fashion critics AND at the same time it reminded me of Hedi Slimane (Celine's creative director) legend in breaking fashion boundaries (which ofc familiar to critics).
JENLISA DEVOURED
LISA IS THE ONE AND ONLY GLOBAL BRAND AMBASSADOR OF CELINE
Seriously no reactiung to Rihanna's "Pon da replay" entrance from Lisa...?
JENNIE transformed into JayZ in 90s and 2000s era with 'em BAR$!!! 💰🔥
BLACKPINK ❤
ONE BY ONE AND TWO BY
JISOOOOOOO
Jisoo is cool
Jennie is the MAIN rapper for a reason. If Lisa got the catchy swag, Jennie has the material and voice for rap! Both slayed! I think and pray this upcoming album is rap centered with great tones and technique from Jisoo and Rosè!
You guys are so fun to watch
LISA serving vocals, rap and dance. She literally the only member trending with 1.4 million tweet right now. Most searched on YT and Google too. She OWNS this track and how! Can't wait for her live performance.
I like your reaction.  please Reack to "DOOMCHITA" By SECRET NUMBER to Thanks 🙏😊
JenLisa back to back We don’t deserve it but I’m glad they do it everytime.
It's litteraly my fave song right now!!
That is jisoo at the beginning!!!!😏
can you upload All Of Us Are Dead here on youtube too? patreon isn't available in my country and i want to see your reaction so bad..
They are scheduled to perform at the VMA’s and Lisa is up for best kpop for LaLisa. You can go vote now.
Jennie was rapping from her chest!! She went crazyyy 🔥🔥🔥
Lisa and Jennie rap is a masterpiece
Yes, as if the song comes from a long time ago
They all killed it. end of story
Lisa is powerful in rap and dancing. She looks beautiful.
Jennie's rap is so freaking amazing
Lalisa so cool
Lisaaa
Jennie Kim the best
Super worth the wait. This is such a BOP. 🔥 We got bact to back rapping from Jenlisa too. Omggggg.
Jennie owns it she's Queen
fav reaction!
this is why jennie is the main rapper
Jennie needed to remind everyone that she's the main rapper and SHE DID 😂
This is their catchiest song yet! I love that chorus!! Great reaction guys :D
Fun fact: Jisoo was in a traditional percussion club in her middle school. That's why she knows how to play that traditional instrument called "Geomungo".
yes, it's jisoo in the beginning, you were right
Ok..just take both jenlisa...hahaha. u guys so funny 😄
Kim jennie is killing mehhh 🥵🦋💞
RIP BLINKS THANKS TO JENLISA DUO 🪦 NOT FORGETTING ROSÉ & JISOO BUT THOSE DUO ATE
That iss Jisoooo!! The one playing the traditional guitar in the beginning is jisoo!!
Absolutly best kpop song
rosé slayed
BLACKPINK IS BACK
LISA ATE ATE ATEEE
Legends
this song was not for me but we all have different taste. i like the rapping part with lisa and jennie but not the rest. i think this part could be a prefect song on it´s own. if felt like i was listening to a rihanna and pussy cat song mixed with a nice niki rap. along with 5 different BP songs in one. the ice cream song and kill this love and du du was in there. i wish someone would make a video connecting the songs together so you could hear it. i was hoping for something completely new and fresh since they has two years to make it
LISA's rap is LIT!!!!!!!
Lisa's eyes turned pinkish after biting the apple, omggg🤧
"Pink venom" is a new genre tried by blackpink, hiphop elements are strongly different from the previous strong swag: dddd ktl hylt ps. People who expect the chorus swag can't hide their loss, but if they don't ask for swag, they can enjoy this new music.
VMA THEY PERFORM I HOPE ITS THIS
have you guys reacted to Jackson wang's recent song? its called cruel and i recommend you guys to check that out.
Jennie SLAYED OMG😭?!!!
jennie is really something 😍
JENLIS IS THE BEST RAPP PART THIS IS ICONIC
You missed the most important part - HOW LISA WAS CONNECTING RIHANNA. Guys i'm disappointed
이아저씨들 몇번을 왓다갓다 하는거여 ㅋㅋ 아주 신낫네 신낫어
They will perform at the VMAS on the 28th 👀
Pink Venom >> HYLT
I literally have goosebumps! 'Pink Venom' is everything! It's different,it's fresh for Blackpink,the rap unit,the vocal unit,everybody going hard for the choreo. The wait was worth it for me. I'M SO PROUD. Blackpink is literally sending the message. 🌟
JENNIE CARRIED
I think it would have been better if there were more rap parts.  it's a nice song though
Hanbin bI wrote whistle thats why he was whistling it
THEY ARE AMAZING 😭😭
BADDEST BLACKPINK'S ❤️
JENLISA 🔥🔥
6:26-6:28 I can’t move past this 😂😂😂
This song is gonna grow on me eventually just like when How You Like That was release 2 years ago  Like i said, Pink Venom is so different than HYLT because we are expecting a big drop on chorus BUT it didn't because YG want it different, Teddy want a different beat  BLACKPINK are not repeating a same song every come back. They just want to make new, they just want to show their different sides  Pink Venom is a hip hop genre. And of course this is a pre release single SO, we just gonna wait for the main track
Jennie eat the whole thing up within leaving any crumbs…
JENNIE KIM was not playing 😭❤️‍🔥we waited 2 years
Jennie
Lisa is an all rounder🔥
I have ascended
Of course, i could see a Lil fickle disappointment when u heard the chorus.🤣
I know this is hip hop song but im sad that chaesoo didnt get any lines but its understandable for me cuz like i said its a hip hop song so jenlisa are fit for this more and CHAESOO EAT THIS CM AND ALSO JENLISA LOVE U BLACKPINK
2:48 Yeah I am Arabian it’s Sounds Egyptian Arabic good Music yes ! It’s Korean 🪕music mix Egyptian music!!!
Jennie owned the song ❤
💞💞💞💞💘💘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💖💗💖💖💖💖💗💗♥️♥️♥️💓💓💓💓

Jennie's cadence and pockets is the reason why she's the main rapper.  Forget about the bars. You close your eyes and listen to her cadence. That's sweet
IT IS JISOO AT THE BEGINNING
U GUYS R THE BEST  I literally enjoy watching your reactions  Love u 🤍🤍🤍
7:18 FACTS
Jennie ate and left no crumbs 👑🛐
I love how everyone is just brushing past Rihannas Pon De Replay Lisa part xD Personally didnt like this song but im watching reactions to see if anyone will notice this part.... i guess they are too young xD
"Pink venom" is a new genre tried by blackpink, hiphop elements are strongly different from the previous strong swag: dddd ktl hylt ps. People who expect the chorus swag can't hide their loss, but if they don't ask for swag, they can enjoy this new music.

Cara, não conheço nada de K Pop mas BlackPink realmente está em outro patamar de tudo. A pessoa quase tem uma convulsão de tanta informação e estímulo em 3 minutos de videoclipe.

Finally someone who have knowledges about Blackpink and reacted LIKE A REAL BLINK. The one I've seen so far gave a very lame reactions and you guys gave me what I wanted to see HAHAHAHAHA. LOVE IT!
I need some support my dear blinks 😂😭 I'm BLINK and love Blackpink I just don't understand why none of my friends like my Queens. It's so crazy how someone can not love them. I'm going crazy in every comeback and I stan them all time. I love all of them. I'm living my happiness in silence and it feels weird 😭
JENLISA FOR THE WIN
I love the reference to Rhianna when Lisa said "one by one then two by two" the way she said it and the flow is from her pon de replay song lisa killed it she gave me a throwback lisa always slays
Whenever there's Jenlisa raps, they Killin us
Jennie's rap was crazy. Main rapper Jennie is backkk 🔥

Please react To Fatou (Black swan) Castle key roll mixtape 🙏🏽
I always love Jennie’s rap her rapping flow and voice tone is just perfection, I know Lisa got most rap part in most recent Blackpink songs and kills it, but there’s a reason why Jennie’s the main rapper, she has that old school rapper vibe, while Lisa is now generation rapper with unique tone. Both are killing it though, it just the matter of preference
cant wait to see them performing this on award shows
I love you guys😂the reactions are always super funny💙
Really love Jennie 💕👑🔥🔥🔥🔥

Am I the only one who didn't like the song at all?
Epic MV. Amazing everything was phenomenal. I have no words to write what I feel !! Thank you Guys for amazing reaction as always.
I KNEW THAT “ONE BY ONE TWO BY TWO” LINE SOUNDED FAMILIAR!! Rihanna Pon de Replay omg that song was years ago and it’s nice that Lisa killed it regardless. Lisa and Jennie ONCE AGAIN KILLED THE RAP AND HIT HARD
QUEEN IS BACK Y'ALL!!!!!
LISA RAP THE BEST

Why can’t you just appreciate the song as a whole without having the need to compare just don’t get jt
Finally we have Jennie's rap in a blackpink title track!
Jennie really just snapped. She is the ace and icon of this group.
I didn't like the song unfortunately, it didn't live to the hype
This reaction video is one of the best!! 🔥
jennie always shows versatility when she gets rap lines 🔥🔥 main rapper for a reason
You guyss are so funnyyyy
For any music lovers out there, the beginning of Lisa's first verse (with the door opening) is from Rihanna's song 'Pon de Replay' from the beat and the words. I love how they link past iconic songs.
Rose is everything
It’s jisoo 😭
Jennie best rapper
jennie
They will perform in the VMA's this 28
This was really new side of BLACKPINK... i don't know why some people are saying they expected more in chorus like in dddd, ktl.... This is literally another concept if it was like dddd or ktl then wouldn't people complain saying that they sound the same....
Am I the only one who thinks that words are not rhyming and it makes this song harder to remember😭anyways I hope bsides will be better
ROSÈ KILL THIS
LISA SLAYYYY❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
ChaeSoo back 2 back in the bridge slayed

Jennie Kim main rapper come back 💔❤️‍🔥👑
Ripped off Notorious B.I.G.'s Kick In The Door lyrics. Typical of Teddy these days, he's no longer original or fresh.
This song definitely for western rappers
Every time you paused Lisa's part it's literally a perfect pause I mean look at her face omg
I can’t believe we got rapper Jennie 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 she’s fcking ate it
This is the best reaction
Jennie: Diamond Shinin  Lou and Ous: DIAMOND SHININ Me: 🤣🤣

MAIN RAPPER KIM JENNIE NAILED IT!!✨
Я влюбилась в этих парней😂
PLEASE STREAM HARDER SO WE CAN SET NEW RECORDS ! PINKS/BLINKS DIDN’T SINK BASHERS ,WE JUST MULTIPLY AND WE WILL RULE AGAIN
Lisa came through in this one. Not just her rap, but her vocals and her dance!!! She nailed it. I swear her vocals are still so underrated. I barely see anyone pointing out her incredible vocals. She lives up to that title of ' the Ace'
Almost exactly 2 years ago, BLACKPINK released their best song Lovesick Girls, and they went 180 degrees now on his comeback with their worse song to date. Teddy needs to retire already. Ratatata

Disappointed MV it's like a mixture of hylt and kill this love but girls did good especially Jennie damn her rap, her expressions just killed it after a long time she got her rap parts she just ate it such a queen👑
they are going to perform on mtv vma
Blackpink is going to perform at VMAS 2022.. LETS WAIT THEIR PERFORMANCE!!😍😍
The Celine reference is for haters, so in the last PFW there's certain people who said that Celine gonna drop her for a certain idol so here is her answer
JISOO QUEEN 😍😍
JENNIE ATE HER RAP PART
As a Jennie bias since their debut i gotta say im happy she got a rap part since I LOVE HER RAPS AND WE BARELY GET TO HEAR THEM ANYMORE and both jenlisa ate their parts the power they hold along chaesoo with the vocals Love the song and your reaction
Dope reaction!!! They had me hype af during my reaction this BLACKPINK comeback is insane!
The boys reacting had me whizzing 😂
BLACKPINK indeed is and will always be the revolution
Jennie rap mehn
I love how they sync in some reactions
Jennie Coco part give me chills ❤️‍🔥
Omg Lisa and Jennie kill the song and the mv was so fire but I love your reaction videos 💓🔥
It feels like Blinks all over the world are crazy‼  ️The strongest girl group in the world is back‼  ️‼  ️
JENNIE'S CADENCE FROM BEGINNING TO END IS JUST 🔥
At this point Rosa and jisoo deserves better I thought black pink was a 4 member group but it’s only a 2 because I didn’t see the others and that sucks
"Pink venom" is a new genre tried by blackpink. hiphop elements are strongly different from the previous strong swag: dddd ktl hylt ps.People who expect the chorus swag can't hide their loss, but if they don't ask for swag, they can enjoy this new music.
enjoyed so much for this reaction vid. y'all are unlike any other here
JENNIE'S RAP SHE ATE THIS💚😭
MAIN RAPPER JENNIE IS BACK 🔥 QUEEN
I think the video and choreography were really catchy, but you can tell they are thriving on cultural appropriation, those reggae sounds and rap plus the aesthetics were mainly black culture. It’s amazing how Koreans are extremely racist and jealous of anyone coping their culture and aesthetics but all they do is thrive of off black creations and never give credit, that Teddy producer definitely grew up listening and mimicking the black music culture and it shows in almost every BP music songs and videos, the mannerisms and copying is so obvious, some people think these girls are the “queens” of swag and rap but they are far from that, I say they are popular mainly due to a large Asian fan base, and Lisa catapulting it to international interest. The song was entertaining, the video was entertaining but I am not happy with the hypocrisy in K-pop. Thanks to black culture they are where they are but won’t admit it and will pretend they were never influenced by it. I hope the K-pop marketing one day dies off, they have a lot of money to pay for their popularity worldwide and pay to reach to many audiences, they steal and thrive on black influence, they are culture vultures, but they wont fool everybody, some of us know they low key admire black culture but hate black people because of the color of their skin, I am a mixed girl and I stand 100% with my black side, they are color obsessed, that’s why the phrase: BORN PINK on their album. I hate the hypocrisy of these people, black people should start being like those Asians who support their own heavily to the point of obsession, maybe that way, we can stop making other cultures rich of off our creative minds, we are the #1  trendsetters and the real creators of cool and swag culture.
they all killed it !! esp lisaaa 🔥
OUR MAIN RAPPER JENNIE KIM ATE THIS
1:39 that is jisoo you fake money hungry  blink
JENNIE JUST REALLY SLAYED THE RAP AND EVERYTHING
LISA' full fire all mv🔥🥵🌟
I love your reaction 😂👍🏻💖🖤
Same I like How You Like That more
If after all this waiting, they didn't release a banger like this. We would have filed a petition against YG 🤣🤣
Rapper Jennie came in hard and ate
jennie really do ate that rap verse! ❤️
JENNIE’s RAP SLAYYY🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jenny was fireee
Jisoo on the Geomungo in the opening! Has me in a chokehold! Her visuals are gorgeous! 😍
Ya funny
If you don't listen to BLACKPINK, what the fuck are you listening to..
it goes HARD!!! all girl are amazing <3
All the girls performed fantastic but the song was repetitive. No shocks. Really hope the album is better.
The rap slap and the visuals ahhh love it
I don't know why i only love the rap sections, i expected more from Blackpink because i love them very much. I hope the album will give me more love as i expected.
I missed blackpink and you guys both, i always watch your reaction videos and i do really appreciate and love you both:>
LISAAAAA
Jenlisa 🔥🔥
👑 is back
Jennie’s iconic speedy savage rap literally Slayed❤️
Queens 👑👑👑👑
black pink❤️🔥
Lisa and Jennie rap ain't no joke
Jennie such a bias wrecker
1:40 that was jisoo guys, she’s playing the Korean traditional instrument
fighting over who has better rap verse but then ending up with choosing both 😁
Blackpink in our area
At first I was shocked then I was like WTF WTF THAT'S MY GIRLS 🔥😭
Love your reaction 🥰🥰🥰
Jennilisa rab!!!!
The best reaction i ever watched today
Rosé tunnel be looking like a scene from Alchemy of Souls
2:35 Lisa is Lilith/Eve, in this scene🍎🐍🌳. In HYLT, she was “Plain Jane”, walking in an Egyptian market. Now she’s Lilith, offering the “forbidden fruit”, inside an Egyptian pyramid. In HYLT, she sarcastically asks her haters how they like, the upgraded “Plain Jane”. Now she’s taunting them, because they fell for the temptation that she offered. Wether antis seek out BP to spew hate, or they are Haters turned low key viewers. They are all contributing to BP’s wallets. Even though, they mocked them & swear, “BP will never get a dollar out of me”. That’s why the apple she holds, is ALREADY bitten. Because their haters, already unknowingly, took a bite out of that forbidden apple🍎😉 . She even has the mythical SNAKE, wrapped around her neck (BVlgari snake necklace🐍).
That was jisoo guys, she’s playing the korean traditional instrument
Queen Lalisa
LISA PULLING OFF ALL OF HER POSITIONS HERE! RAPPER LISA, SINGING LISA, MAIN DANCER AND CENTER LISA!!! LILIES WON BIG🔥🔥🔥

y'all this reaction!!! loved it but also thus MV is mad and their references!!!
Jennie slayeddd asfff
IM SO HAPPY LISA FINALLY CENTER AND JENLISA KILLED IT
Ig lisa was dissing people who say lisa looks ugly in this nd that outfit she be like its ‘designer’s crime or it wouldn’t be me’  While jennie one she’s dissing people who say she doesn’t have private jet when many were saying she’s having some ninja technique that’s why nobody kn when she travel back to korea from LA 😎🖤💗
Definitely Jennie era she killed that from start to finish and her voice on this that pink venom part INSANE and finally she really show up as the main rapper that she is she is crazy
Pink venom have elements of Jennie Solo live performance + Rosé love sick girl pink paint+gone now it black paint dark metal rock + Jisoo solo live performance + Money +Sexy girl
Lisa channeling Rihanna w/that, “Pon de Replay” line 2:10, & carrying that Boombox like it’s a Celine handbag🤣. JenLisa Rap Queens, dropping the mic w/those bars🎤, that we thirsted for.  Empress Jisoo blinding us w/those GORGEOUS visuals.  The Queen of the Underworld Rosé, slapping is with those vocals, & the attitude.  Plus the outfits, the production, I mean, I can’t even pick what I liked best......CUZ I LOVED IT ALL
Jennie is the ace of the group for a reason she ate
“Bodies on bodies like a slow dance” I love that part lol Main rapper Jennie coming through spittin that fire!!! Love that jenlisa part   The music video is bullshit .. yg really did the least with this and it’s literally like the same setup as kill this love..the way the video flows.. if that makes sense.. similar to ddu du ddu du… it’s just so not enough after these girls have been waiting like 2+ years for a comeback?!?!? This was not the music video that they deserve and I know they’re going to get shit for it and that makes me mad. Whatever they killed their parts and visuals are crazy when it comes to the girls… the song is pretty good… think I need to get used to it… but the way they deliver everything makes it better lol I just think they deserve more than they get… they’re so talented and hard working ya know…. Yg just doesn’t show them the respect they deserve imo
I like the reaction so much😭😭
The rapline hit HARD this time 😭 I'm still shookt ,this is their best rap ever together.
Jenlisa killed it
Lisa is my Bias but Jennie ate that NO CAP
JENNIE RAP JENNIE ATE THE WHOLE SONG
The more I watch it, the more awesome it is!
BLACKPINK SONGS ARE DOWNGRADING FR WHAT HAPPEN TO TEDDY? MAYBE I EXPECT TOO MUCH BUT THIS COMEBACK IS THE WORST DISAPPOINTING ☹️
JISOO 😭💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
MY QUEENS JENNIE AND LISA BRINGING THE PAIN ;)
JenLisa rap is iconic. This is History for the books.
"Jennie ate" no lies detected
Jennie🤩🔥🔥
Rap line slayyyyyyy
The Lisa/Jenny rap! The beat! The lyrics! I wasn’t ready! I literally BLINK <3 IM GOING TO THAT CONCERT IN LOS ANGELES!!!
THEY‘EE GOING TO THE VMAS AND PERFORM THIS THERE BTW
LiJan reppp Goodddd
JENNIE BE KILLING ME WITH HER POWERFUL “LATATATA”🥵
Highly recommended to react band called by Voice of Baceprot. they are a progressive heavy metal rock band fronted by 3 young women. They even played at wacken open air 2022 by invitation without an audition. Before performing at wacken, they have finished their second european tour.  You can try to make a reaction from the 3 single songs they have today such as "Not public property, God allow me please to play music, or school revolution", or even you can see their action when performing on the transmusicales, french. That's really awesome..
This that pink venom!!!! Taste that pink venom!!!!  Luv this song so much!
AMAZING  BLACKPINK
LISA REALLY ATE THIS , for me it is her eraaaaaaaaaa
i was waiting ur reaction guys woooww!!!!!  finally blackpink!! the queens!!
JENNIE’s FIRST VERSE REFERENCES BIGGIE, LISA’s REFERENCES RIRI

9:33 JENNIE WITH THEM CLIPS 🥵🕷💗
ROSÉ QUEEN OF HELL!!!!!
Girllll all the girls slayed in thissss especially Jisoo WOO

I love all the girls, but Jennie really shined on this song with her rap and vocals 🥵🖤🕷
Main rapper Jennie 🥵🥵🥵🥵 jenlisa “bodies  on bodies like it’s a slow dance ?!?” I’m sorry but Jennie’s booty is top tier… I love it!!!! Chaesoo vocals and rocker Rosie, Jisoo being worshipped like she should…. Just loving it!!
Jennie queen
Main rapper Jennie 🥵🥵🥵🥵 jenlisa “bodies on bodies like slow dancing ?!?” I’m sorry but Jennie’s booty is top tier… I love it!!!! Chaesoo vocals and rocker Rosie, Jisoo being worshipped like she should…. Just loving it!!
Lisa is killing mee. She pulled all of her position card plus her being the center in this era. This is BLACKPINK  era.
Jennie needs to rap more. It's suits her  she's got bars
I rewatched Jennie’s rap like a million times lolll
yes, its korean traditional instrument, geomungo😁i really love that chorus part😍😍😍
I FREAKING LOVE JENNIE’s VOICE TOO YOOOO ;)
ohmygoddd rapper jennie not playing
JENNIE SLAY BOSS
Jennie ate
5:56 HAHAHA🤣you guys crack me up  Edit: yes I agree I like Jennie’s rap more because she is literally the main rapper and she hardly gets to shine. She needs more recognition and SHE FINALLY GOT IT!!!💙
Jennie’s “coco” lyric in the beginning refers to how she’s freaking called Human Chanel, as well as her being the ambassador for Chanel 🔥🔥💗
Jennie ate everything
Best song😭
Swagger rapper lisa
After those years, we finally wait for Jennie English rappppppppppppppp
Lisa ateeee fr
Jennie's verse
My eyes were on Jennie the whole entire video! She’s too hot yalll
Lisa's reminding everyone why she always got A+ during her monthly evaluation trainee years. She just showcase her 3 official position on this comeback. she is Main Dancer, Lead Rapper, Sub Vocalist of the group for a reason.
BLACKPINK is EMULATING 2NE1 more and more. The visuals of PV is so reminiscent of 2NE1 and that RATATATATA (machine gun sound like in I am the best). JENNIE IS THE BEST RAPPER!!
Jennie ate 💫🤙🔥
FINALLY YG GAVE JENNIE A GOOD RAP AFTER SOOO LONG! AND SHE SLAYED ITTT :)
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT, MORE BLACKPINK IS BLACKPINK. FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? IT'S DIFFERENTIATED, THESE GIRLS MAKE PINK BECOME THE GREATEST POISON IN A FEW MINUTES TO DRINK, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BEAUTY AND TALENT, IT'S ATTITUDE, IT'S OVERCOMING WHAT IS ALREADY INSUPERABLE, IT'S TURNING POWDER INTO GOLD, IT'S HAVING EVERY LOOK THAT WANT, BUT PREFER TO IMPACTS WITH SIMPLICITY, BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE VOICE THAT TAKES OVER AND OWNS THE WORLD WITH A RIT THAT STICKS IN THE MIND AND MAKES THE HEART PILLAR AND EXHALE THE PINK POISON. SO PROUD OF THESE SUPER POWERFUL GIRLS WHO DON'T NEED A LOT TO BE EVERYTHING AND TRANSFORM EVEN THE SMALL LETTERS INTO BIG AND MEMORABLE WORLD ANTHMS, IN THE END, THEY ARE THE PINK VENON QUEENS ARE NOT AND ARE FUCK!. KISSES WITH ROSE POISON FROM BRAZIL TO THE WORLD. THANK YOU FOR THIS MAGNIFICENT REACTION. ❤🥰😍🤩💝💝💝
