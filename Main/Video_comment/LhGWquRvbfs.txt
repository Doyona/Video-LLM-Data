will done Rory👍👍👍
Crowds Return 🤝 Rory
#freePalestine #saveYemen #savetheUyghurs 💛
When I saw the highlights, I honestly thought it was from 2 years ago because there’s actually people in attendance…  nice to finally see crowds
Can you win the 2021 Wells Fargo championship please
Pink shot trails on Mother’s Day, very creative 👏🏼
Didn’t realise what all fuss was about till today
Wait, am i slow or What happened to Corona? Is this US only?
Well done rory!!
He needs to stick to golf and keep his liberal politics out of the USA.
Swinging so much better and putting great.
Rory’s the kind of guy you can’t help but cheer for. Great to seem him back on top
Come on Rory McIlroy you can do it
Drive for Show putt for dough.!!!
C'Mon Rick!
Tried to follow Bryson as the way forward..not bad in itself but he hung on to it too long...now with the 'hard reset' he's found his new way...which is the old way he had before..
2:00 tiger style😭
Not a very good recap.  I mean you hardly showed the last two holes.
Well done rory whilst you win another pga event making more millions, the haters from the last few months are absent, silent and working their dead end jobs on minimum wage.
q bosta  tenho q vim besses videos so porq meu prof n fala nd disso e fala pra vermos essas bosta
can all 800 ppl upload the same vids from their phones @4:58 please?
He putted for the dough
The advantage to distance is diminished when your second shot is off line straw behind 8 trees
c'mon Rick #LGLG
Stupid shoes. Stupid comment, I know but still... Stupid shoes.
I hope Biden taxes the 💩 out of him. 😂
He was playing more fades than usual. I think that was the key, because draw is harder to control
He's back.
Mashed them taters rick. 4:18
Nice
Yank crowds make golf nearly unwatchable.   Was so much better without crowds out there
MclLory putting like a champ
the man
0:01 Did that guy think he’s Rickie Fowler? I’m pretty sure he said, “Come on Rick!” Lol
As soon as the putter works.. BAM!! W in the bag. Awsomr to see him back in the circle again
So I guess COVID's done now?  Good to know.
Well done Rory! It’s honestly really good to see.
RETURN OF THE MAC
Next...Ryder cup! 😉😊
I see from the lack of spectator masks that coronavirus has ended in the US.
Idk about y’all but this seems like the beginning of a rory push to me. He’s been putting in the right work and it’s paying off now
Let’s go Rory!!
Guess whose back.. back again. Love to see it! well played Rory
Looking like the old Rory.
At last...
Rory had my heart racing on that last hole!
He's back!
Get in there champ
"C'mon Rick" @ 0:01. #ifyouknowyouknow #lglg 😂
Cream always rises to the top! Go rory!
Rory trying to be the LBJ of golf. Manchild.
The "old" class is starting to roll again ...Matsuyama, Spieth, and now Rory!
I can't believe that you missed out most of the drama from the 18th?
its amazing what happens when this guy makes putts.
Great to see Rory back!  One of the best displays of ball striking - simply awesome!
He was overdue
Congrats Rory 👏🏽 🏌️‍♂️ 🏆.
I called it. Rory’s world ranking is the worst it’s been since 2009. He’s 15th going into this tournament. The last time his ranking was anywhere close was 2018, where he dropped to 13th. The next week, he won the Arnold Palmer invitational at Bay Hill. So it was literally impossible for him not to win this week.
How can you not like this guy
And who has helped get him back? Pete Cowen!
Well done Rory!!
DID SOMEONE SAY C'MON RICK in the first clip???? SHOUT OUT TO CHASING SCRATCH PODCAST? AHHAHA
Suck it, Koepka.
If Bryson can avoid those bogeys, doubles, etc... he's going to be tough to beat.  Love to see him and Rory in a final group
Was Rory using a Odyssey putter?? I thought he used a spider x..?
I think the lesson here is, don’t change irons. He won everything with the Rors proto. It was the same situation when he was playing Nike clubs. Switches into the vapor pros and nothing had to switch back to the VRS blades.
Way to go Rory! Glad to have you back in the win column
the shot at 4:40 is incredible
オメデトウゴザイマス！
Great win Rory. Your game is back!!
Way to go Rory. Kid is too good to not win a few times a year. Keep it going buddy.
Well done Rory you deserve it 🥂🥂🥂
congratulations 👏🏼 thanks 🤩
Great seeing big crowds again.  With no masks!
Congratulations Rory, wonderful play, you the great and big Man golf. From Carlos Bogotá Colombia.
Where can I re-watch his drive on the 3rd hole today because my goodness.
Watched this live good game
Will he ever win a Masters?
Nobody is a bigger fan of Rory McIlroy than Rory McIlroy
What sweet joy it must be to strike a golf ball like that. Perhaps in my next life. (sigh)
woah nice crowd. I assumed this video was from years ago
RORY! RORY! RORY!
Rory come back again.
Never noticed Rory choked down on his irons so much
Congratulations 🎊 Rory. im your fc from Thailand.
Rory!!!
To anyone who wasn't watching the broadcast: Rory really had everyone shaking on that 18th hole lmao
5' 8", 32-year old but still hitting one of the longest drivers now added accuracy. Way to go Rory!
You love to see it, played excellent, well done Rory!
This is the only thing I watch on TV anymore. The PGA should keep this in mind if they are temped to inject left wing politics into their broadcasts.
Everyone is really waiting for this, He returned his Golf Skills before... Very serious and enjoyed. You really deserve that! My Love Rory Congratulations!!! 🔥⛳🏆😍❤
I like the way he won. He made the right decision on the last by taking the drop. Good on the caddie for slowing him down. He has always been a favorite of mine.

YES McASSY
Well done Rory, this win meant alot to him, seen his post match interview you could see it in his eyes, Winning on Mothers day and as a Father makes it sweeter. I knew when he sunk that par putt at 12 he would go on to win.
spieth, matsuyama and now rory. let's go!
Solid performance
4x better than DeShankbo.
THE RORS🔥🔥🔥
Big up Rory
Rory showed his maturity on 18 and was able to think in the moment. Glad he didn’t play it left...
delighted for Rory,,,it will do his confidence the world of good..... im sure its been hard for him the past while, not knowing if it will ever come right for him again with all the chopping and changing on and off the greens...put much respect for him...kick on and get another major
Glad Rory gets a win. Looks like he’s in good form atm hope he gets another major this year
HEAR THE RORS🔥
Worth the wait sir. Well done and well deserved..
Rorrrry
GUESS WHO IS BACK
