As a Madrid fan I respect Barca I like them there a good team like Real Madrid
*EIBARMAN*
How do we go from this form to losing 4-1 against PSG? Of course, they are a formidable club, but 4-1? What the hell happened?!
"Quicker than a Chinese delivery" hahaha what??
Dear friend, We must love those for whom Christ died as well as those in whom Christ lives. As a convert to Jesus Christ, Nabeel Qureshi has written books to help his readers understand the people in the religion he left. His tone is respectful, and Qureshi always displays a heart of love for his people.                                                  Qureshi dedicated one of his books to his sister, who has not yet put her faith in Jesus. The dedication is brief, but powerful. “I am begging God for the day that we can worship him together,” he wrote.                         We get a sense of that kind of love as we read Paul’s letter to the church in Rome. “My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief,” he said, “for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed—cut off from Christ!—if that would save them” (Romans 9:2–3 nlt).                                                     Paul loved the Jewish people so much that he would have chosen separation from God if only they would accept Christ. He understood that by rejecting Jesus, his people were rejecting the one true God. This motivated him to appeal to his readers to share the good news of Jesus with everyone (10 : 14–15).              Today, you may prayerfully dedicate yourself to the love of our Creator THIS VERY MOMENT by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life. Welcome Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with love! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
Yes
Psg 4-1 uefalona
Who's here after Barcelona lost 4-1 against Paris
PSG?
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
4-1 against PSG 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and Barca fans claim that they’re getting back in form 🤣
ESE TECNICO ESTUPIDO AYQUE BOTARLO ALA CALLE MO SIRVE PARA NADA
AYQUE CAMVIAR A ESE TECNICO ESTUPIDO QUE TIENE EL BARSA DESDE QUE ALLEGO ECHO A PERDER AL EQUIPO CON SUS CAMVIOS DE PERZONAL
Messi should’ve gotten a hat trick
Ray Hudson is such a great commentator takes the game to another level
The commentary is majesterial lol
💥👍🏻
7:21 when you stick it in the wrong hole
Joe Biden: "We have to destroy millions of American jobs to save the planet, but I fully support Chinese Communists even though they pollute more than the rest of the world combined!"😜🤪😝
Joe Biden: "We have to force people to take this toxic COVID vaccine to save lives, but yet I just signed a bill that quadrupled the price of insulin so now millions of diabetics who can't afford their medication will die!  Also, you can't sue if your family member dies from the COVID vaccine!"
La verdad, es que Messi,,es mucho lote,,lo maximo, un Bacan del futbol, mundial
This does not change the fact that Griezmann missed literally two open chances
Peace guys, I sell raw seamoss and seamoss gel,  hmu!
messi perfection mode
Ephesians 5:15-16 "Be very careful, then, how you live — not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil."
Griezman is dog shit shoulda bought neymar
PSG vs Barça without Neymar  Sad.
Hala Messi
Maf respect to bein sports for postnig the highlights within 10 minutes!
The is the barca futbal we know them for
Messi was robbed off a hattrick, that Var ruling was scandalous and Barcelona haven't been getting any penalties. The one on Alba last game in Copa and this joke of a rule out.
busquets is making amazing passes
They have to take out griesman yes or yes  he cannot play in the Barcelona
The lean europe byerly brush because armadillo consequentially disarm outside a brainy pipe. ratty, expensive tip
Enough with the Chinese delivery remark.  It's getting old.
When the Jedi council come to arrest you: 4:19
LMAO... I love this announcer!
That Griezmann chance at 7:21 would have been FIREEEE
GOAT
4:44- messi 4:45 MEssi 4:46 MEEESSIIIIIIIIII  🐐
Can that commentator please stop screaming?
Hudson is going down as one of the best who ever did it. Facts.
JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Christ Jesus paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. How can you pay Him back? You can pay Him back through spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”. He offers you the free gift of eternal through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Christ Jesus is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re a sinner, lost without Him and destined for destruction, REPENT, REPENT, REPENT, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Christ Jesus. Have a blessed day.!
“Messi in, quicker than a Chinese delivery” 😂😂😂 “There’s more fizz than an Alka seltzer in this football” This guy im ROLLING

Lionel Messi was in different level, No chances for defenders. I hope Barcelona will have a good match with PSG. Don't ever make a mistake like 1st goal of Alaves, but don't worry so much, because in Barcelona, we have a player, he is not a human.
Estaba para los árbitros de españa😎el. Era gol😎 lopodian ver dado como gol de Griezman😎
King Messi
Griezman is washed
7:21 When you really trying to get that last poop out
This team was CLASS 🔴🔵✨💥🔥🐐👑
The Messi Griezmann connection is growing stronger every game
this is how you score goals, not like Penaldo always waiting in the penalty area for an error..
7:22 when your _______
Super g⚽️al Leo Messi 👏👏👏

He did it by being tortured, whipped, mocked, spat on, kicked, beaten, and died on the cross because they nailed him to it ✝️ once you believe and live for him! You don’t understand how much His love is man it’s unexplainable! God bless you and thank you for your time reading this Jesus is the way the truth and the life! ❤️🥺🙏🏾
Messi is so good at scoring long shots
Who else thinks the announcer in on something. Like wtf, comparing a goal to moon landing?? 😂
In the off side goal taken down i believe the Alaves #22 is the one that breaks the offside but they used the foot of the other player??
These men talking making little sense to me
He knows the laws, the laws don't know him....
Did
The commentary is hilarious
Jesus is coming for his people , seek him today, we are not promised tomorrow , give your life to Jesus and turn away from any bad deeds.
Pedro and Puig's flows
Hey guys, I post a variety of gaming content. I've been on YouTube for a few years and still don't have many subs, please check me out if you can! God bless :)

Why de John on Defense?
Only one goat Messi! 🐐  👑
HAPPY HARRY WARDEN DAY EVERYONE! ⛏
Chromosomes moving around in him that belong to a bengal tiger  - Ray Hudson
Puig trincao this guys they are good
Puig is the new Iniesta/Xavi, doing a hundred of one-two's with Messi
The disallowed goal was such bullshit honestly he's not even offside it's imposssible to see 2 millimeters from this distance. Nowadays they wanna call offside on aything. Such a bad decision.
When messi wins he carried , when messi losses he gets 💩 on
Chinese delivery I’m dead
Messi faster then a Chinese delivery lmao
Not enough praise for mingueza’s defensive performance
COMMENTATOR :  “This match is as calculated as a NASA moon landing”   Me after the disallowed goal: yup, you got that right.
2:17  Happy Valentine's day everyone!
R / WallStreetSilver
Now this is Barcelona
This commentator uses all the metaphors,similes,adjectives in football sounds sooo magical 🔥🔥
What a performance 🎭 Barcelona Messi beast!  Pacheco did a good job also, hey! He tried
This commentator.
Griezmann plays better with barca than with real sociedad.
Nobody is talking about the passes of sergio busquest ?
Well, it's not business but I don't why bein networks used this idiotic anchor to anchored this match like barca playing a good team. Pls bein use better good sport Anchorage not idiotic fan of wasted Messi
Is it me or does it look like in trincaos first goal the pass was meant for Messi?
Fake crowd, fake crowd noise, fake everything nowadays...

This shows how football evolves.  It was all crossing until tiki taka break thru defense came in wow this made me so happy the beauty of barcas play
Hey
who hired mcgregor as commentator tho
Phil great commentator
These British block head announcers are just to much sometimes so annoying. They think they are good commentators too which is the sad thing , you suck
10:01 chromosome swimming around him... lmao I’m done
God bless all who reads this and takes every steps towards him. Don't put all your love and trust in human beings for they are temporary and can mislead you instead SEEK,  LOVE, and TRUST in GOD solely. HE provides us with things that last a lifetime into eternity. God loves all who seek him and want to be obedient to his word. Use your talent to give praises to him and his son, Jesus and apply his word to your life. GOD loves you and is ALWAYS with you. LEARN about the power in the name JESUS.
JsLRwuReOSE
As a true Barka fan this club is done even worse than arsenal.
Look, Messi played PHENOMENAL, but Ray Hudson’s bias was quite evident lol (“Aaaa!!!!! every time Messi did something, whether it was simple or magic 😂). He’s still an entertaining commentator, but bias isn’t very professional.
Ray Hudson is the best commentator of any sport or event in the entire world
People need to give Junior more time he’s a great player, idk why he gets some much hate. Him and Fati are going to do some much damage on the left wing there’s a reason why Fati likes him so much. Mark my words he’ll get better you’ll all see!
Ted Lasso brought me here...
A smart coach will try disengage Messi slowly out of the attack while maintaining the same level of performance by the other young cast.  Unfortunately Messi is engaged as ever.  This could diminish Barcelona for at least 5 years if and when Messi retires or leaves.
TerStegen sucks and u can’t change my mind
This match is as calculated as a nasa moon landing.😂
messi contract should be a billion
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
How many times griezmann gonna miss perfect set ups lol.
Eden is better than Trianco because of his injury
Trincao at 9:10 thinking: "Oh my goodness, I can't believe I get to play with Messi."
I love Phil and Ray as commentators. Together they have great chemistry and I hope we can have more exciting American commentators like Phil. I don’t even need to explain the work of Ray. Absolutely amazing the duo. Jose Hernandez was amazing when he was still on Bein. Hopefully Bein Sports never lose these two amazing people
The one commutator would anything to cover up messi’s mistakes lol Messi probably pays him or the league
lets see how many subs i can get frm commenting under this at 41 rn
He knows luck but luck doesn’t know him damn and quicker then a Chinese delivery haha
Blessings to whoever is reading this!!! 💵🅰️🅿️🅿️$LandLordFilm 🙏🙌🤲
I like how happy Puig is when his teammates score a goal. I hope he becomes a Barca legend
god this game was amazing to watch🔥🔥😭
we saw the essence of tiki taka in this game fr
Ok. I think the rest of the year could get interesting
Start Pedri in & hopefully we'll have Ronald Araujo healthy & we'll put a good fight against PSG
8:45 Messi “Quicker than Chinese delivery” 🤣😂😂
Que grande es messi ,peroooooo con equipos chicos eres tremendo descarado mas de 70 millones al ano y no le marca a los grandes y menos en champuons
Anyone catch the Steely Dan reference that Ray snuck in there? Lol
Riquí Puig, LA REENCARNACIÓN DE INIESTA , sin duda alguna 😎
$Stroidzill   If you gave money then please reply to this comment so I know who It was and so that I could thank you non-stop
Vxvc
Sometimes Messi makes bad decisions..I get it ..he wants to score, but there are times he needs to pass the ball and he doesnt ...others have a better chance of scoring.  Either way he played well this game and scored 2 amazing goals
This guy 7:20 😂
Ray Hudson makes great plays even better somehow - his passion is infectious
Griezmann is soo whack 😢
Once again Messi shows up against little teams in meaningless games but will disappear in champions league when it matters
10:03 even ball boy happy for Messi
Messiiii
Ray Hudson’s verb of the day: Slingshot
Magical messi scores 2 amazing goals
Are puig and Pedri The next xavi and iniesta?!
This audio is amazing its music to my ears
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Outstanding fc Barcelona world class !! Best performance yet 20/21
Messi es algo sobrenatural es un alienigena que vive aqui y decidio jugar este hermoso juego 🙏 GRACIAS MESSI 🙋‍♂️
Bro can this commentator stfu please
Messi should have had a HAT TRICK.. First Goal is legal.
Riquí Puig 👀
such lousy commentary
8:04 Messi: How Did I miss! 9:08 Messi: Ima Score from this distance
That was real Barcelona football after a long time. 👏🏼 "Defenders were following him on Twitter, he shows up on Facebook." 😂
Ray Hudson: Defender were following Messi on Twitter and Messi came out on Facebook :D
This is Barcelona
Wanna see some sexy pics of me text me 😉 4804396971
here are some facts that Barcelona can't win the next match.
Papa Lionel with his kids at a local playground....
Love those camera angles for the VAR to show offsides
Everyone talking about Messi and trincao, but busquets passing this game.
beIN Sports are on the ball, great work
This felt like 2008 Barcelona not gonna lie
I love ray Allen 😂😂
The fact that Firpo scoring more than hazard
Why doesn’t Messi do this in every game I only see him do this against small teams

What a game LOL Messi salary can paid the whole team and stuff included Huesca it’s a any towns team kmon man
Messi is over here scoring against teams like Deportivo Alaves, Levante, Huesca, while Cr7 is scoring against teams like Inter, Roma, Napoli...
I swear Messi is the most precise shooter I have ever seen
Ronaldo who? Messi the best ever. GOAT!
Griezman freaking sucks bro. Like seriously. He’s shit. I don’t like him. Let a new younger player play
busquets played class
Dude why is Ray Hudson screaming in my ear😭
visca barca
It isn’t just messi scoring, his team helps him get up there to score, they give him a good ball and he scores. Barca is just brilliant
The narrator is really passionate, i like it
Messi’s disallowed goal should have counted because to be offside a goal scoring body part has to be offside and griezmann’s hand was Called offside so the goal should have counted
Messi is the king of scoring on weak teams that’s for sure.
Ray Hudson's hyping of Puig (a mediocre player, at best) gets old after a while. He sounds like a teenage girl carrying on about her favorite boy band. And his constant criticism of Koeman - an infinitely more accomplished player and coach than Hudson ever was - is laughable. Reeks of insecurity.
Including the moon's gravitational pull? Damn, Messi is next level
How do people still compare Ronaldo with Messi mad respect to Ronaldo tho
Ray Hudson simply a legend
😂😅 The cerebral dictator... Nobody does it better than Ray Hudson
Messi makes ray Hudson the happiest commentator on planet earth 🌏
Look at #6 for Alavés during the first goal. He puts up his hands in the box. Come on man, that's just sad and poor defending 🤦‍♂️
i hate the commentators every time messi plays geez they act like jesus came back to life or some like chill.. messi is good but relax 😐😂
Take the ball, pass the ball That’s why I love Barca Love that commentator too 😂😂
Ray Hudson is amazing best commentary
It should be 6 -1 the ball was played when they put griezmann offside
Quicker than a Chinese delivery... Priceless!
Did you see that thing Mingueza did on the first goal? Kid was center back last news wtf
Goat really
I play Messi at the level  in the games online
Firpo might be better than Alba
Damn these commentators suck
This man has the quickest wit and tongue on earth. one of the best announcers of All-time.
2:40 why is it offside? insane
I hope you guys at least play  like this upcoming champions league games
Ray Hudson 🔥🔥🔥. Especially when Messi plays!!
Umtiti sucks
Man 😭 dont want cr7 n Messi to retire its coming to an end Enjoy people just enjoy 1😥😢😭
Commentator man🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂😂
The commentators are so biased. They scream every time Barcelona makes a pass but whenever any team scores on Barcelona they just casually say “amazing goal by ______ good job”😐
Bayern Múnich  is Next
Man I love you Messi. I hope everything goes his way with whatever happens to him
Messi is the epitome of the beautiful game. More than just goals, magical passes, vision everything.
The nervous condor orally treat because manx strangely drip alongside a flat jump. puzzling, sassy protocol
7:20 SUAREZ ON THE VOLLEY!!!!!!!!!! 😔
Griezmann plays like shit.
Playing with kids like Riqui and Pedri has rejuvenated Messi and he looks like he's having a great time again and is back to his best.   This was like Barça football from the best years. Of course, we still need to be aware that it was against Alaves. The real test is on Tuesday vs PSG.   Still, this was so much fun to watch. Super happy for Puig to get the full 90 and he certainly didn't do anything to disappoint. Not only a great, Barça type player but always with a smile on his face and great attitude. I can't believe we even considered selling him.
The keeper from alaves was doing good tho! Feel bad for him
Wow what a masterclass game. Força Barça!
barcelona wins to the sixteen on the tbble positions?    lol
Glad to see Messi and Barca back to their phenomenal selves, from a Ronaldo fan. Hoping to see the two GOATs play each other in a UCL knockout tie this season. Good luck against PSG next week! 👍
Like always, only vs weak teams lmao
And to think Griezman once said he belonged at the same table as Messi and CR7 .  ok
That commentator is annoying af
i cant believe this guy. which goal is better
My reaction when Arsenal doesn't finish off a great attacking move. 7:21-7:23
if anyone besides Leo made that goal it would be goal of the year, at least
When Messi scored his second goal one of the commentators was screaming in a funny way
I’m having a seizure understanding the analogies the other commenter be saying about Messi😭😂
puig: iniesta 2.0
trincao: incredible potential while under pressure
that 2nd goal tho
Ray👀
This barca squad and these starters have been the only lineup that has scored this many and feel comfortable with playing each other. They have to keep this team and keep playing them. What a great performance
Fifa hates fc barcelona... So many hat trick opportunity for messi but misses.
Messi had the Hat trick!! Right??
Riqui puig and messy are on 🔥 PSG get ready for the mourning
As a fan of game ...who have no horse in this race ...ray hudson needs to pull his face out of messis ass
4:20 Ray Hudson turned into Palpatine for a moment lol
Great game by the bois! 🔵🔴
This is what happens when Barcelona actually starts crossing the ball
Pacheco needs to go to a better team. Messi's game was amazing, he's enjoying again.
Phil: Messi quicker than the Chinese delivery 😂😂
Did he said quicker than Chinese delivery 😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Even the players weren't to hype, because they know PSG is coming. Barca can beat them but its in Defense hands
How Greezmam  is playing for Barca and   I am not !
Pedri is the hands down best thing to happen to barcelona in a while.
THIS IS NOT AN OFFSIDE
This was beautiful!
this is typical tho nowadays, we win big against small teams but when it comes to facing big teams, like PSG, we screwed. We couldnt even beat Real madrid in the last two games against them, i honestly dont know how we are going to handle PSG
The keeper was the defense 🤦🏿‍♂️
I don’t think ppl realize how hard greizmann has it. Man shoots most of his shots with his weak foot
Bro this commentator lmao😂
Bro the Scottish reporter loud asf lol
Trincao has me very quiet right now. my respect for him is just going more up❤️💙
Man I wish I could listen to Ray talk about the GOAT 🐐 all day and night.  He made it look like a NASA moon in Miami Beach. Perfection.   Good all around match. Look like Griezman is learning that it is his movement that works well with Messi.  Expect it and it will come 90% of the time.  Great pass across the 6 yard box for the youngin to get a goal.
Complete performance!!!
I don’t hate griezmann but, he needs to push it a little be more . A little more confidence and he would be a monster in the goal area
Griezmann cant score to save his life
When messi scored the second and just spread out his arms, Beautiful. And the energy of the commentators is phenomenal we need that in the copa del rey
Chromosomes live inside him that belong to a Siberian tiger 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was shocked VAR did not reject Messi’s first goal. The post was clearly offside ;-)
Barcelona wins = fans excited -- still needs defense big time 🤭
Messi in quicker than a chinese delivery 8:45 😄
Puig needs more playing time, I love the passion he shows whenever Barcelona scores
Messi is still the best. RESPECT4EVER ❤️❤️🙌🙌
i wanna see the  same performance against psg . will it happen ?
Good game. Busquets and alba just chillin after messi second lol they are so used to it already haha love BARCELONA
Honestly seeing barca play like this made me super happy especially when messi scores twice and helps contribute to every single goal. With a fully healthy team and good chemistry trust me culers we can do a lot of damage. The refs were trash tho the score could of easily been 7-1 without var 😂
Cmon this is Alaves. The real test is this Tuesday. If not Messi should just move to Miami ASAP nothing to do w this club anymore.
barca getting tiki taka again and im going googoo gaga
U don’t have to be a fan of Messi to respect his game. ....... he’s extraordinary ✊🏿🌎
The commentators scream after griezman  got to that chip pass by messi was so funny
It's awaking / esta despertando el jugador de play station
"The defenders are following him like they do on Twitter, but he comes out on Facebook"      The best commentary line I've heard in my lifetime.
Ofcourse messi always shows up against the likes of getafe and alaves hahaha
Messi deserves every penny of his contract.
Una riata parada el shequetito
The commentary always screams loud and it is so annoying
Messi again licking his fingers playing bottom half teams and shitting his pants when it actually matters. Typical Messi. And the conversations for GOAT starts as Messi slays Alaves. This guy scores enough goals to hide how shit he is against the top teams.
I can see Messi staying. PSG doesn’t feel like a fit. Neymar is often times injured and Mbappe has seemingly disappeared
Messi is the best, anyone who doesn't agree is just braindead.
Been a while since I enjoyed a Barca game!  Valverde & Setien 🤮
Busquest doing the xavi/iniesta job
Hope Messi never gets old. He's awesome to watch, his vision and ability to place the ball is just beautiful. I love football ⚽️
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😈😈😈😈😈
Roy Hodgson 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Very fluid attacking football. It’s been a while since I’ve been impressed by Barca’s match performance.
Why am I happy for barça
7:20, penaldo can only dream about this ball
10:27, can your penaldo deliever this ball, he can only dream
Puig & Pedri were on 🔥🔥🔥
the defenders are following him like in twitter but he comes out in facebook, WhaT?!
In other news, "Copa Libertadores returns in 10 days." Just had the final a couple of weeks ago, and the Club World Cup about a week ago. Damn, y'all.
Puig+de John+ Pedri + Trincao with Grizmann and Messi on top = LOVE
Puig running to messi immediately made me remember messi running to ronaldinho. Such a beautiful moment. I really hope koeman finds it in himself to play Puig more often for the full 90+ minutes
Let's all take a moment and think how this sport going to change once Messi and Ronaldo are done.  He knows the laws but the laws don't know him. Well said 👏
These highlights are amazing!
7:21 wtf
I’m a CR7 fan, but I honestly don’t know how can you hate Messi. I will admit, seeing him win trophies can be difficult for me, but that feeling never lasts long. His pure artistic brilliance on the pitch never ceases to astound me. As football fans, we should be GRATEFUL that we get to experience the CR7 & Messi era.
Messi bais in full display. Messi and Griezman both miss the same chance. One gets slammed for missing the other gets praised for missing it
Umtiti really dude??
Ray Hudson makes it even better lol the goat of commentary
Beautiful Barcelona futbol
just holy sh-t. messi's goals....just wow. Master
That commentator gets wet with messi ...besides they let him do that in spain he always gets alot of space he wouldn't do that in italy or england leagues or World cups or else were ....
2:20 sound kinda familiar
Ray Hudson's Commentary > Any other Commentator 🤣
His goals are magical
7:22 Luis Suarez would have scored that...anyone agree
dumb var
Now this is Barca!! 6:55
messi💙🐐
Messi 👽 most complete player i ever seen.
If they allowed hand offside football should use hand to touch the ball I don’t understand this is offside
C.Ronaldo is good player but can't reach the level of Messi this guy what he is doing is unbelievable
Ray hudson: Messi calculation is good as Nasa Moon landing, The defenders following him like they do on Twitter but he goes on Facebook, Messi faster than Chinese delivery, and etc etc 😆😆
este farselona solo con equipo de media tabla esque se cre grande  ahora la semana que viene en champions  van a llorar gallinas yorones.😡😡😡😡😡
Thanks to beIN sports
On Tuesday Messi will come out on Instagram 😂
let’s hope barca plays like this against psg
Greaseman is trash
Trincao basically stole messi goal
who else smiled when Messi and Puig did the give and go ?
My man Ray is getting younger and happier because of Messi 😂,I’m happy for him tho.
The day ray Hudson dies is a day I will cry
Trincao🔥🔥🔥
Var has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen that’s been put into any sport lol
11:40 Koeman is upset with the 5-1 victory, he is probably saying, great I put Puig to show people why he does not play, now that he played will im screwed. No smile as you can see.
Leonel Messi, bewildering magic 💫🌀
10:11 The REAL reason why Puig does not play. Because he is close with Messi.
7:49 messis soo humble before celebrating he helps the opposing goalkeeper up
The VAR and the defense of barca are jokes... When Messi is happy, everything is in great shape!
So wonderful wonderful MESSI
2:14 when she starts giving you the gluck gluck 3000
Like I always said Pedri and the important Puig, I'm fed up of seeing Bosquets enough is enough, they pulled him off and they scored back to back.
BEIN IS THE BEST 🔥🔥
That color commentator is literally Gus Johnson’s understudy
Great form in the second half. Great game! Keep this chemistry up, get grizzy to control that footwork and this champions league run is gonna be a good one!
7th ballon loading 🤔
Yes koeman yesssssssss we Barcelona fans love this outstanding performance !
Came for the game, stayed for the commentating
If Griezmann tried to kick a soccerball into the ocean he would still miss.  Off the team!
Who is that commentator that screams for like 2 minutes with no reason? It’s so annoying. That’s why I rather Argentinian commentators.
That was a BEAUTIFUL GOAL MESSI
And people talking like he isn't worth every dime he's been paid?! Any team would be phenomenally blessed to have Messi at any price no matter how astronomical! I don't blame Neymar for fighting to bring him to PSG, s**t I'd take a pay cut just to get him there,he's that valuable in my opinion.Why do people think Barca' can't seem to let him go? Messi's greatness is not just the magic he creates on the soccer field,it's also he's ability to make everyone around him better,he's genuine humility and love for the game, Not to mention the unbelievable joy he gives people with just he's presence! We are all blessed to be witnessing such genius in our lifetimes! Unfortunately he's greatness will only be truly appreciated after he no longer plays the game!
Estoy volviendo amar estas jugadas del Barcelona
7:20
Espero ver esos goles cuando te tope el paris o Bayern.
The commentator soaks “ Messi quicker than a Chinese delivery”🤣🤣🤣
Ronaldo started this season off better but Messi is back to being the GOAT
Finnally a decent game from us
We gave them in chinga of goals ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙👑👑👑
Commentator in love with Messi?
Messi ,great game!
Griezmann...what the heck. I always defend you on Instagram.. u gotta do something bro don’t disgrace me like that. Any way gg ☺️
Griz u suck...
I think that I learn more similes from ray Hudson than my English teacher
Ray Hudson is something else
My heart beats harder and faster as I see each goal. We need to do this vs Sevilla!! Cmon BARCA!!!
Trincao needs more time like 45 minutes maybe because today it was excellent,it deserve the man of the match trofy
Griezman is a fraud
Greizman sucks dude..
That VAR decision was simply a looting
How could Messi think about living such a great team yet in becoming. In 2 seasons, this could be unstoppable. Força Barca !
Alavés goalie just wants to go home!
These thugs who operate VAr -drid  should be ashamed of themselves
“He knows the Law but the Law doesn’t know him”😂👏🏽
The 2nd commenter looks like he's having a breakdown🤣🤣🤣
Ray Hudson moaning so much it almost got him killed
6:58 😔🙌
7:18 just wow
He knows the laws.. the laws don’t know him lol
The greatest of all time is Ray.
Best game of the season for Barca so far! 🔥
Messi! 🐐🔥⚽️⚽️ What a performance! 🙌
All left footed goals
Messi is the football.
Anyway, Messi is not just a king but the Engineer Of Soccer.
Alguna duda de quien es el mejor del mundo .. penaldo is a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last goal from Senior to Jr!
Messi and Puig 11:23 😍
Why did the second half look like 2014/15 Barca ?
That commentator busted up my eardrum on messis second goal lol
Messi played like man I cant wait for psg
Umtiti played well today 🤪
Finally! That finally looked like the Barcelona we all know and love
#17 should learn from #7 how to play as a team, he should have passed the ball to #27
Alaves goal keeper is awesome i give him the man of the match
That play at 0:30 🔥
Never seen a man happier than Riqui. Riqui for president guys!! I fking love that kid haha
Messi the kinda guy to be setting up teammates for goals AND assists!
@ 30 seconds tho the touch and pass 😍
Even though we aren’t winning anything this season, it was a big step forward that Koeman took with what he was given since he started. Literally trusting the youth and giving them chances, great transitional year so far.
NEVER EVER COMPARE MESSI TO ANOTHER PLAYER AGAIN!!! EVERR!!!!
man his mic is too loud 😭
Waooo la magia de Messi ,,, no pueden comparar a Messi con NADIE,ok
Sucribe to TalkFCB
The juries in the VAR room were the same juries as on OJ Simpson’s case.
Holy shit Bein you might not see this but your appreciated you paid attention to the fact that highlights were late and that people didn’t like the game being spoiled and you’re constantly improving thanks
7:20 the commentators scream killed me
thanks god for messi
The goat 🐐 tapinaldo and penaldo never going to match his genius
Barca playing their best ball, but I’m afraid Athletico too far ahead.
"He knows the laws (physics) but the laws don't know him" lmao 😆
That was the most fun I’ve had watching a Barca game in a long time. Easily the best they’ve played in a very long time, they had like 4-5 of the most beautiful plays I’ve seen in a while
I already watched the whole game but I came here just for Ray's commentating
Firpo is straight trash 🗑
"13 years later and defenders still haven't learned to never give Messi space" - The Futbol Assassin - BARCA!
can we appreciate Ray Hudson's commentary
these commentators are amazing
we have so many hungry young talent but koeman isn’t using them,always have the same shit line up and players
Messi is getting better as he age.  Like Tom Brady!
Anyone know why on the fanatiz coverage it was two different commentators? I’m sure their coverage is Bein sports so strange that these guys aren’t on there commentating
If you guys look closely at 7:18 or 7:19 grizeman told the player to pass it to Messi while he continue to run knowing messing was gonna pass him the ball..that’s what we needed from him this whole time
fabricated offside
RFEF AND LA LIGA trying to sink a CATALAN club. mateu laoz the other day wasted more time than sevilla ever tried to
Emperor Palpatine 4:18!
Best to ever do it
Messi to Moriba @ 5:06 "you see how it's done"?  Moriba: Yes boss
“The defenders following him like they do on Twitter, but he goes on Facebook.” IM WEAKKK LMAO RAYYYY CHILL
Seeing Messi and Puig reminds me of how Messi and Iniesta played! You can tell they’re starting to really know how to play off each other
Puig and Messi play would have been wonderful
That effortless tap Messi gave to Greizzman so that Firpo can make it was awesome.
What a game for Barca
Messi the #1 best player in the world! Love this guy!
Puig’s passing is out of this world😳🤯
Messi doesn't just settle for tap ins and pens got to respect the true goat
Messi quicker than a Chinese delivery😂
He says they're following Messi on twitter he goes on facebook 😂 so funny
Ray hudson is so funny man smh I love him
Wow Messi is quicker than a Chinese delivery 🤣🤣
Messi best itw
RIP to headphone users 7:20
Riqui Puig take a bow kid !!! Promising talent !
Somebody needs to put some tape on this mans mouth he gonna bust my eardrums
VAR = Corruption.
Nobody is talking about Pedri’s performance as well. He’s been improving a lot.
Lmao most of these easy tap ins Braithwaith would’ve missed lol
I don’t think pique should come back
OMG Barca's DNA is coming back.
I assume it was good, for the moment I heard the hysterical English guy I couldn't keep watching.
no lie bro but busquet's vision is immaculate wow
Araujo is useless
Visca barca
Scores a goal that crosses the touchline but doesn't touch the net and a goal from just out of midfield with 3-4 defenders in sight? Messi the KING!  Umtiti still not very useful in this squad tho.
there is var corruption is going on in la liga.
No offside goal, Varr are corrupted
Bro messi is heating up. If barcelona can improve their craft and have this messi playing, we are looking reslly good
This commentator is amazing 😂😂
Who dug up Sid Wadell? Copoycat hyperbole...
Beautiful football
Messi’s playing out of his life to secure that PSG move
Messi scored 2 brilliant goals today. Respect from a ronaldo fan
Imagine watching this without the color commentary. That guy almost ruins Messi magic.
Griezmann is like a bmw. Really good engineering in most aspects but the most unreliable.
Barcelona’s getting so much better
Barca this season has been atrocious when facing better opponent. PSG will be a real test next week. As a barca fan, I am hoping for a win but it will be hard to beat PSG.
Mad respect ✊
Messi quicker than a Chinese delivery 🤣🤣🤣  If we play like this against psg will win
Busquets need to stop playing as a defensive midfielder (because he’s the reason of the awful defense there) and start playing as a regista like pirlo and carrick, I’m sure koeman is doing it but those players (registas) need two box to box midfielders with them, that’s why he wanted wijnaldum.
Wow Barcelona vs alaves please let me laugh
These English narrators are really lost, I don't know what they are talking about, well to the point there is a big difference between what Luis Suarez contributed and what Antoine Griezmann contributed, Messi puts goal passes and most of the time he fails them
The goat 🐐 is back
Tell penaldo to score 2 outside of box goals, this beautiful in one match
ALWAYS HAS AN EYE FOR THE PASSSSSSSS .... LIKE THE CYCLOPSSSSSSSS
“He knows the laws, but the laws don’t know him” 😂
Messi 2 -Cristiano Ronaldo 0😝😝😝
The more Griezman grows that hair the more goals he misses
they can definitely trash PSG playing like this....and I was wondering if VAR was going to disallowed all goals cause that's what they usually do against Barcelona
Moriba needs to replace Bosquests from now on in the midfield to give Dejong and Pedri the freedom to run forward and why not Puig join them. I swear this is what they need. No need for Wijnaldum or any other mid we just need a Emerson back from loan and Gaya/Bernat at LB and 1 CB
7:03 was that a little bit of tiki taka i saw there
Barcelona might have a chance winning the champions League
they literally called griezmann offside by a finger
How in the world was that Messi goal offside?
When Coutinho comes back this team will be even more unstoppable
1:10 Trincao’s confidence to shoot the ball and Messi was behind him 😂
6:58 this is the tiki taka we need
Koeman is an idiot. He’s so high happy with his Dutch overrated De yong. If I were Messi, and this man continues next year, I am out. He is really bad, good in some, but overall bad, couldn’t win a big match or team. This says it all. Firpo should always be a start up, subbed by Alba, same goes for Pjanic and Bousquets. Pedri is amazing, but he obviously can’t play 3 good games in a raw, he is still very young, and what a wonderful player is Rikkie Poch. Add on top of everything, this manager, not once, he did the right substitutions during the matches he managed (which is why we lose to big teams). He is not the man for the job.
Two reasons to watch this: 1.Messi 🔥 2. Ray Hudson commentary 🔥
Messi masterclass today🙌
I love these commentators! They're the best! 😎
I really don't like that man when start screaming
the reporter with the high voice sucking the skin outta messi
Against alavez 🤣🤣 look at his stats against top tier teams
The commentator never fails to excite me with his commentary
4:20 Palpatine?
I’m here for “Quicker than Chinese delivery” LMAO 😂
4:20 emperor palpatine
Can we hit a LIKE for Pedri !!!!
that commentator busted 10 different nuts for messi
....and he takes everything into account, including the moon's gravitational pull. O'Rrray
7:21 Ray Hudson: “AOAOAOOAAOOA”
Messi was as fast as chinese delivery 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Messi is doing that🤷🏾‍♂️.. I don’t remember a game where he scored two bangers like that. Not like that
Puig is so good bro I’ve been watching this kid since 2017
Ray Hudson needs a raise
"The defenders are following him like they do in twitter"💀
Lionel Messi was on fire in this game if he keeps it up Barcelona will have chances of beating psg.
Bro this comentaer is so loud when Barca scores but when they score dose not say a word
Unpopular opinion, Ray Hudson is annoying
"The defenders are following him like they do on twitter, then he comea out on Facebook"...am done 😅😅🤣🤣
The defenders are following him like you do on Twitter ...and he comes on on Facebook 😂😂😂
Bro Messi of back in the day would’ve chipped the goal keeper in that one play where he fell!!
Visça Barça  vamos por Psg
Where are my FC Barcelona fans In YYC? This game made the day warmer.
Sometimes I watch these highlights just for Ray Hudson's screaming commentaries 😂
Is messi just now starting to shoot from far so we can appreciate him even more or???? WOW.
11:26 "Messi-Puig, Messi-Puig,Messi-Puig.....Messi"
Wtf how is that offside 😂 whatever 🔵🔴
Le hace goles a equipos chicos aver si cuando juega con buenos parece que no jugará
I think that 1st game against PSG is for Barcelona however the 2nd game is for PSG now the question remain. Who is going to qualified for the next round. It will all depends on the defense.  The good stuffs here is that Neymar is injured so it is one problem solved for Barcelona already.
Messi touches the ball.  Commenters it was all planned it he’s a wizard
This is that Barca I like cmon 💪💪💪🔴🔵🔴🔵🐐
This is that Barca I like cmon 💪💪💪🔴🔵🔴🔵🐐
8:00 that handshake was the best 😂
What a beautiful football from Barca.
Messi GOAT 🐐!!!
So that high line of Alavés didn't exactly pay off, huh?
Champions league trophy“ LOADING “. Messi’s  7th Balón d Or     “ LOADING “ Madrid nadaplete this season “LOADING “
There's the team I love. Hope they can do it more than once every 3 years.
Griezman bro’s train more I swear
Worst commentator ever, wtf is he even doing. Just making sex noises. I mean I can see how others might like him now. Andres Cantor is the GOAT
Gotta love these commentators😂 I’m used to prem league ones
Barca can’t perform against big teams
Ray Hudson is one of the greatest commentators of all time
I love how much Ray loves his job
Playing like the good ole days
Messi looks so unhappy with this club rn
I don’t see this Barcelona team winning much this year or next, but watching this young generation, especially Puig and Pedri, I’m hopeful for the future.
Messi second goal gave me the chills
props to alavez goalkeeper, great saves but watcha gonna do wheb your defense gives messi 2 feet of space
goal keeper saves messi shot messi: aight bet
the commentator is hilarious lol
I swear Ray Hudson literally creates a list of metaphors he can use about Messi before the match lol.
griezman be missing chances after chances come on i though griezman was a beast after the past games
quicker than the Chinese delivery lol
The best sequence didn't even result in a goal (7:12). Still beautiful.
I don’t know if you noticed but Messi could have scored a Hat-trick but make sure to assist is team mates! THAT IS MFK TRUE CLASS OF FOOTBALL ⚽️
What’s Barcelona going to be after messi
This commentator is a Messi fan
When Messi smiles, everyone smiles, except the opponents.
Vale los 555millo
The " TIKI TAKA" IS BACK🔥🔥🔥 11:23
Messi quicker than a Chinese delivery😂😭
Why the F*** is no one talking about 7:09 when this would've been the goal of the season?!
15 years later...Messi is the same wonderful player...he is the GOAT and without drugs like others ,I jus saying
When will Messi retire? -Alaves fan.
Messi is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The 🐐
Riqui had the most passes of anyone in this game, just saying 🤷🏽‍♂️ kid’s fire rn 🔥
This is what match called Barca, missing this kind of game since some time...
Ray Hudson: AHHHHH  My ears: Owwwwwww
Not a bad start from moriba, hopefully he can learn from that mistake
How is that commentator allowed to make sex noises on live TV?
Barca is back 👑
I thought commentators weren’t supposed to be biased
We need to finish our chances we could have won by 7 or 8 but we make bad decisions in front of goal
Puig & Pedri are playing like the future Xavi & Iniesta
Did he just said the defenders were following  messi on Twitter  and  he comes out on Facebook. What a comment.😆
Messi voice 🗣 we hit thoseeee
What is Gary Navel saying??
Barca fans are getting hyped for beating Alaves 5-1 😂😂. PSG are gonna smack you😂😂
Now Messi doesn’t have to go inside the box to score goals it will be tougher to defense him.  It’s like Stephen Curry making points from the half court line... unfair
Trincao is in fire
Everyday Riqui plays , he reminds me more and more of Iniesta
Griezman ass man.
Stop shouting cliches!
Worse commentator ever he's all over the place
Hudson the messi of commentators!
“Messi quicker than a Chinese delivery!”
Barcelona played so well that Bein sports couldn’t wait to upload the highlights.
"Messi in, quicker than a chinese delivery" lol
how has messi not made it in the first 11 TOTY????
Trincao > Felix
This barca will destroy Atletico's
“He knows the law but the laws don’t know him”. - Ray Hudson
2:16 when she finds the right spot
They actually can beat PSG UNA. Is just that Koeman is their manager, he is not good enough. Messi is just Messi. Ppl say he is the GOAT they may be right. But fans today are deluded because Ronaldo lost and he played a better team, and Barca fans on Twitter acting like it happens every week. RONALDO IS STILL THE GOAT, BUT MESSI OMG HE IS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING. BETTER THAN NEYMAR, MBAPPE AND HAALAND COMBINED FFS.
9:21 is that a SMILE I see from koeman?
The fact that Ederson getting more assists than Hazard
It would have been hat-trick but that offside😭
Me thinking 🤔 how to beat psg
I came here because I wanted to hear Ray Hudson’s reaction to Messi’s goals 🙂
Ilaix, de jong, puig, pedri, the future of FCB.
That moment at 7:00 gave me chills. Reminded me of the days of tiki taka.
😍😍 my club
The laws of physics don't know Messi but Messi knows them lol.   You disallow Messi a goal and he will come back and score two that you wouldn't know where they would come from. Absolutely magical.
these commentators suck the meat off of Barcelona
Whenever the camera pans to Koeman after Messi scores this season, he looks like a man thinking to himself, "What the hell am I going to do if he leaves?"
Barcelona is far from getting the title but if barcelona continues this form than they can win La Liga.
Yep they are back, Messi seems like he is a pretty good player
Pedri. Shades of Xavi / Iniesta:  7:13 and 7:40. These kinds of plays are routine with him.
Lmao I see barca fans praising trincao now that’s he scoring but when he washing they called him “waste of talent” man y’all barca fans are something else💀💀
That scream @7:21 lol
Messi played like an absolute Crak today ⚡️⚡️
Get the fans back in there :/
Gooooolaaaasoooo!!!!!!
7:20  “asfahhahaggghhhh “ 😂😂
goat messiah
don’t say these goals were against alaves when u wouldn’t even be able to score these type of goals agasint a bunch of old grannies
Obviously Koeman sees something in Trincao, hopefully he continues playing  with ambition
Good win for Barca. Instill don't care RONALDO IS THE GOAT. NOT EVEN A DEBATE
Messi quicker than a chinese delivery brooo whatttt
Like always MESSI showing what he does Skills .....Very nice goals.....
Ray Hudson and these quotes make the highlights so much more enjoyable.
Dumb how var works griz arm was offside so they didn’t count it
You guys remember what I write here, next year there's not going to be messi, Barcelona finishes the league 8 place
Messi sin dudas el mejor del mundo ....vs equipos debiles claro !!!!
"THE DEFENDERS FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER AND HE POPS OUT ON FACEBOOK" ray hudson commentary never gets old
Lerobaron un gol a Messi
this barca team is playing beautiful football and we need to enjoy it while it lasts
7:22 Ray Hudson accidently stepped on a lego
Even though I’m a Real Madrid fan, Messi... he’s an animal
Once Again Messi and Barca Beating the Little Teams and Losing to the Big Boys😂😂😂
I think koeman now knows that pedri and puig starting is critical
9:27 😂😂😂 Messi is the goat of football always and forever
Im sorry but Umtiti has to go
This is the Barcelona i like to see
I like how after the GK saved it Messi went back to help him up. World-class but still has sportsmanship and respect 7:51 👏
Messi. Enough said.
Still trying to find odeshit and puskas in the comments bet they hiding in their caves 😂😂
Puig and Messi connection tho ,
7:18 the commentator's reaction 😂
The GOAT SHOULD HAVE GOT HIS HATRICK THE REFF ROBBED HIM AND HIS GOAL BEFORE YHE FIRST HALF IS JUST GOLRIOUS
I’m sorry but what kind of jerseys are those Alaves?
The defenders are following him on Twitter and he comes out on Facebook 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Roy hodgson
Cuando cr0 va a llegarle a este jugador.  Ni a las patas le llega. Piernas locas cr0
Messi messi il giocatore più forte al mondo
I love the commentator, lmao. 😂😂
“Got the defenders following him like on Twitter”
"The defenders are following him on Twitter and he comes out on Facebook..." lol
what a game!!!
Esta gente para que celebra los goles si pierden el otro
Griezmann, why didn't you dribble the goalie or send a lobbing kick? For a guy with your experience... In addition, how many times I wrote about using long distance kicks rather than tikka-taka system?
4:20 emperor palpatine
We need to work on our defense , other than that we’re looking really strong
7:21 climax of the video
These commentators are the best in the world no cap
Messi es Messi el mejor del mundo y  nada más 🤗🤗🤗👍👍👍👍🙏🙏
“Messi quicker than a Chinese delivery “
Wow almost first time in a while Barcelona plays like Barcelona
we expect barca play like this against PSG but the consideration should be given on defense.
To be honest our game is so fkn slow. Defensively we r so fkn poor. We are just passing , passing , and loosing ball . We don’t play the fast aggressive soccer these days that’s why we lost against Sevilla. Barcelona after scoring 2 should have subbed Messi.we got big game coming next week. The only player that tries to speed up the game is Puig. Coming from Messi fan . I believe in putting pressure on opponent keeper  striking from far so that the keeper will start panicking. Too many passes in the box and loosing ball leads keeper to gain the confidence...
That was offside on Messi??
"Always has an eye for a pass like cyclops" I did not hear this before.
How that is offside 😒😒😒
9:21 koeman wanna smile so bad but he’s like nah keep it 😂😂😂😂😂😅
how does ray  hudson come up with these comments?
Why is the other commentator so over exaggerating like that was no impressive goal, coming from a B fan; wink wink{{[+€
@7:21 that's my cum voice
Ray Hudson annoying af
Damn it people messi should of had that hat trick. Damn those refs
Messi can do anything
Why did sergio busqeuts play like prime pirlo in this game lol
50% of the entertainment from watching Barca games comes from barca playing, the other 50% comes from Ray Hudsons commentary.
What’s with all the screaming man? There people with headphones here 😂
A los mandriles se les fue hasta dentro, según Ray Hudson hicieron.. aaaaaaaahhhhh
Still trash team
8:45 "Messi in, quicker than a Chinese delivery." ~ Ray Hudson
Umtiti out
Griezmann finishing is terrible.
6:57 what a buildup that was
Jesus the passes form Messi are immaculate
They are going to win the champions league forsure now 🤣🤣
This is the most beautiful football I’ve seen from FC Barcelona since Luis Enrique left
Messi knows the rules but rules doesn’t know Messi.  Wow what a saying. Like that so much. ❤️❤️❤️ How about you guys??
GET VAR OUTTA HERE! At least give coaches 1 - 2 VAR reviews a game...
Great game🔥💯
Lets go Barca we are going to win the league !!!!
Incredible football.  Would’ve been a lot more goals scored if neymar and Suarez were still here...
Good game! Let's try to keep this form against PSG tho LOL
11:23 Just look 🥰
The chemistry between Messi and Puig is out of this world
Wow first time I see Barca play like Barca in a really really long time. Cheers
Messi is build different.
i love ray hudson
Commentor (on Messi's Goal): The defenders are following him like they do on Twitter but Messi comes out on Facebook😂😂😂😂💔💔💔 9:32
2:22 exact reason why I feel Griezmann should not be in Barca
I love RIQUE PUIG he’s the next xavi what a game for him
One of the better full team performance this season by Barca. If the youngsters keep playing with high confidence then Barca got a chance to finish top of the league.
Barca fans getting happy just cuz they won to alavas, But no cap Leo Messi With two goalzo
Barcelona should sell coutinho and umtiti and buy Halland. Eric Garcia and Alaba can come for free
6:06 lenglet could’ve done better than that wtf
Messi scores and he makes the rest of the team play. He is the 🐐
I don't get these offside calls. They should only count offside if the players torso or legs are in front, not arms or butts or hair. So stupid. This goes for all teams that have been screwed over by pick and choose refs that decide this time it's offside and last time it wasn't.
If they play like this PSG should be worried
Haven’t seen us play like this in ages. Love the speed that Pedri and Puig add to our movement.  And haha Junior’s hug at 4:53 is so cute.
If Messi leaves for Man City, this Barcelona team will be average at best. He conducts everything in the team. Koeman is just a figurehead.
The announcers 🔥🔥🔥
Leo Messi-- God of football
I feel riqui puig is gaining confidence, brilliant performance.
My god these highlights are so class. Champagne football
Messi🐐
The commentator's screaming is plainly annoying.
The commentator that is older is annoying always hyping up messi messi messi like stfu annoying old piece of shit
Commentator is arrogant on that offside call. Thank god he doesn’t do premier league.
Commentator is arrogant on that offside call. Thank god he doesn’t do premier league.
Puig and trincao should be on starting 11 from now on.
I love this man's commentary incredible :)
is it firpos time ? firpo > alba
Just seen the game , if Barca plays like they did the second half , they have a chance against psg , Bayern fan btw
If barca play like this vs PSG good chance to win
These commentators are on barca nut suck i dont see them hyping up no other team like how they hype up barca
Messi was so good today ray couldn’t find the right words
Are the commentators going to jack off tonight to Barcelona highlights? Youve got 2 different jack off styles, and thats probably more marketable then the game.
New barca? Hopefully the intensity remains. Forca cule 🔴🔵
Sergio Busquets is forever under rated but one of the best midfielders of alll time
when he is in mood, you should be frighten in
I never want to end Hudson commentary on Messi.
“Messi quicker than an Chinese delivery”
Just seeing puig and messi passes at 11:23 really gave me goosebumps 😭
These commentary people love barca always seems to be on barca side lol so funny
Safe to say Messi still gots it
5:15  9:05
Without the two off-side goals barca would of won 7-1 let that sink in..
Riqui Puig's energy, motivation, concentration, skillsets, and brilliance remind me so mcuh of Xavi.
Is it me or riqui puig is like Barca number one fan , the guy seems happier then the goal scorer everytime
Respect to the commentator, that’s passion!!!
Lets gooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥
oh man I love the commentary man
I  wanna be the first dislike on a lot of people’s comments 😂that’s kinda why Iam here besides to see some messiah(Messi).
This video needs a headphone warning. My God this announcer is loud
Messi is gonna win Pichini again
The way Griezman and Messi are starting to link up 🔥🔥
The defenders are following him like they do on Twitter and he comes out on Facebook 🤣🤣🤣 Ray is the 🐐
Bringing back Tiki Taka football.
Looks like the tiki taka is back
Roy Hudson 🐐
Me checking the comments almost certain that the commentator will also be part of the discussion.
They need to fix the offside rule because how many times have you seen VAR dissallow goals because their arms are ahead. You play Futbol with your feet not your arms
Francisco Trincao is breaking out finally.
I’m the biggest Barca fan but there’s times where I wish Barca saved their money from Griezmann and coutinho
Disallowed goal, Messi gets angry and scored! Missed one on one, Messi gets angry and scores again! Don't get Messi angry, hahaha, or he'll score more!⚽️⚽️
Messi is unreal 😍
I want to see the part where messi picks up the keeper seems like he gave him respect for blocking his shot
4:42 9:07 The goat The best
ESTA ES MI BARCA VAMOS VISCA BARCA❤️💙
I cant believe the refs in la liga extending the line to Griezmann's arm so they can make the goal offside
Messi #1
Grieze is so baad
5:40 “he knows the laws the laws don’t know him” best pair of commentators
this is the Barcelona I know, spanking these small teams
Messi and Puig duo 🤩 But Messi got robbed of his Hat-Trick 🤬
Messi cambió el regateo por goles increíbles
busquets the common denominator in all these goals
11:25  mann its been a long time since Ive seen that :’)
Wya odegard and chealsea 77?
that offside call tho..
Men it could be 6-1 but no it was ofside that's bullshit
This commentary annoying af
If Griezmann was offside then we should’ve seen Tigres vs Bayern battling in a penalty shootout if they would’ve called Robert lewandoswkis arm offside in the Bayern goal
Messi does it all!!!!!
Never heard someone suck the soul out of Messi like these announcers did like damn bro relax.
They need to do something about that VAR judges.
Just look at that smile 9:35
Griezmann is so bad
Gol robado a messi
My Man Really said *MESSI QUICKER THAN A CHINESE DELIVERY* I'm done goat certified
Messi is beyond everyone
Never change Ray Hudson!
7:19
This might be one of the best performance from the great Ray Hudson!! “He decorates the net with the football” just some many lines in this game! Love him!   Has for Barca the last highlight with Puig & Messi reminds me of Messi & Xavi or Iniesta ...the back & forth passes in the middle of the defenses like they are on the practice pitch! The Future is Great for Barca!!
Pedri vision is up there I really like him I hope he stay in the club and grow he definitely can be big for Barca the way he playing
He really said Chromosomes flowing in him that belong in a bengal tiger 🤣
Pedri waw what a talent.
So happy for firpo and trincao
This is giving me 2011 Messi vibes damn both of those goals ⚽️ ⚽️ were bombazos 💣  💥
i still don’t understand how people compare messi to ronaldo.
the 2nd goal from Messi should be illegal. thats a moving free kick without a wall
Is it me or is the commentators on crack
Where number one where number one where number one go Barca go team go messi go Barca go team go messi go
Unfortunately, Umtiti failing again.
These VAR offside calls are retarded. Also I’ve think I’ve seen enough of griezman to say that his right foot is worse the robben’s right foot
The fact that barca scored the same amount of goals this game like hazards entire Madrid career
11:22 reminds me of tiki taka’s old days
One of the best games by far. Really excited to see the Psg games. Hopefully the intensity and the connection is there.
🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴
Hope PSG watched this game!
7:42 what a beautiful fuc*ing pass from Pedri
Tikitaka being reborn? Maybe...
Messi, Trincao, Dembele, Jordi Alba, and Pedri are playing top quality this season. I feel Barcelona making a comeback with Koeman...
11:23 ✨Puig ✨ 🤩
The fact that Messi is carrying this finished club
Odegaard 21 and RMA and Ade to Var disappeared 😂😂 they can’t stand the goat performing
Bruh Spanish team aging Barcelona are a joke they don’t play as they play against Madrid is not the same intensity like they don’t run they cuz been waiting for them back there is crazy
They took a goal away from Messi but he showed them that wasn’t gonna matter. lets go Barca against PSG we can do this If we play like this
this is what happens wen u give messi space to shoot, imagine if defenders gave him as much space as they give ronaldo, he would've had more goals than ronaldo.. damn lmfaoo
i appreciate you guys not spoiling the score
8:45 "quicker than a chinese delivery" 🤣🤣🤣
the fact that junior firpo scoring more goals than rodrygo and jovic in la liga
VAR is a devise designed so no footballer can monopolize the sport. But Messi still does it.
"The defenders are following him,like they do on Twitter and he comes out on Facebook"😂😂.
Today midfielder reminds me of x&I everything felt like old Barca
the greatest performance ive seen in a long long time
Quicker than a Chinese Delivery 💀💀💀💀 hahahah
Puig has that crackhead energy with no quit! Crack loading!
4:38 that pass from Busquets to Messi was beautiful
Messi defeated VAR on his terms
the fact that 18 year old ilaix moriba getting more assists than hazard on his debut 🤣🤣🤣
Penaldo 0 goals 😂  Messi is the goat
Trincao finally showing his potential
It’s good to have won one of our best games of the season, but Koeman should provide support for whoever will be on the right flank as RB against PSG, if not, we gon’ get smoked
Pounded into the net by Messi, impressive laser beam
RB+B Messi overpower fifa shot
I just love these commentators
Was hearing headphones at 7:20 💀💀
Ray Hudson’s commentary is 🐐🐐🐐
Messi, Messii, Messiiiii...
Keep makin highlights this long not 3 mins
The fact that junior has more goals than Marcelo and has started less games than him 😂
trincao is the next coming of bernardo silva
Alavés men only scoring against Alavés 😂 finished club 😂 finished player 😭
someone tell me what boots i should get
Puig mouth be like 😁😁😁 everywhere M&T feet be like⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Ray Hudson again 7:21
How is the 2nd goal count as offside?! WTF man!!! Why does it count the armpit (or in this case, the line looks like its on the hand)?
Finished? Pessi? That’s weird 😂it sounds awfully quiet
Where is odegaard 21 and BBVA Puskas hiding?
Shades of vintage Barca.
Nex cr7 trincaooosiiiiuuuu
Favorite English commentators
Not Greizmann missing another wide open shot...
I was at working and couldn’t watch the game thx for the fast update 🔥🔥👏🏾I heard Messi was magic
Classic VAR
Liax with two assists one for us n one  against us, welcome to t he game boy
Stoked Puig finally made a full appearance. Dudes got vision and heart.
first goal = puig _ mingueza _ moriba _ trincao the futur is reassuring!!!
Umtiti is ass
Moriba with two assists on his La liga debut😆
Trincao from Braga, where have you been? ❤💙
11:23 man... Does this not remind you of old times?? Puig and messi combinations my goodness🙌
8:45 ''Messi quicker than Chinese delivery ", Lmao.
Quicker than a Chinese delivery 😂
How much griezmann cost????????
Amazing performance by the team today 🔥 Proud of my babys 🥰
We can’t keep conceding goals from defensive errors.
Magical Messi👑
Damn Frankie playing defense
*Netflix: Are you still watching?*  Somebody’s daughter: 2:19     Edit: Check out my Snipes thoe for more goated content
Man I cant wait for these commentators to retire
Messi in, faster than a Chinese delivery- Classic Roy
It’s just Messi what can I say
cant wait for fati to come back 😆❤️💙
The standing are very tight  Atl-54 Bar-46 Real-46(technically second by head to head, I think they will lead the aggregate, those 3 away goal must hurt for Barca) Sev-45  I think I going to bet on Barca to best psg now.
The day puig played full 90 minutes we score 5. That’s how you know he is one of the best players in Barca right now
Barca, Please play the same way against PSG!! Barca record against big team isn’t good this season so they better win against PSG.
Big credit to Koemen for turning Griezmann, pedri, and Frenkie into elite contributors to the team. Improving Trincão’s presence on the field. Believing in Puig when he did not at the beginning of the season. Also trusting into youth a lot. His work with Barcelona isn’t done.
and they said Messi is finished 🥴🤣
Messi would like to dedicate his goals to his biggest fans ❤️ Ødeshit and BBVA dumbass
Why doesn't Koeman plays Collado?, is he waiting all the players to get injured so he can play them?, La Masia players need minutes, Ilaix got and Assist in his first game smh
Messi cofee in the morning and in the afternoon 😌
Ray's moans just make everything 10x better
Brilliant performance for barca, Trincão scoring 2 and messi scoring 2 also. If they could play like this against sevilla That would be excellent.
Messi: scores a rebound that was offside anyway Ray Hudson: AAAAAAAAAAA
0:30 no one gonna talks about this play?
And people are saying Busquets is finished
As a Madrid fan Messi is the real goat
Wasn't expecting this much goals scored today but gg!
im blind or messi was offside on the 2nd goal ?
Messi will always be the goat and that will never change
Fun fact: Out of Ronaldo's first 84 goals at Juventus. 25 of them were penalties. Do the math. Messi is better
odegaard21 and his girlfriend BBVA puskas crying right now in their moms basement
Now keep this against psg on the upcoming week!!!!
Messi is gonna have the most goals scored of all time when he retires
Messi is still the goat. And good game from Trinicao. That's the first time I've said that... Trinicao looking good. VAR is awful. Griezmann was NOT offside. Arms shouldn't count. It gives no advantage
IIaix doing more in his debut than overrated Marvin shit
The second half was just hands down magical
The fact that Junior Firpo is scoring more goals than Hazard
Barca madrid are done teams
It would’ve been 7-1 if those goals weren’t offside 😭 but good game overall ‼️
This man is a living legend 🔥
Man, Busquest with his passes are 🎆🎆🎆
“The defenders following him like they do on Twitter, but he goes on Facebook.” - Ray Hudson
That is just what I call decent tiki take 11:24
Great game. Transition season is on the right track. It’s time to stabilize the squad and their chemistry. Anything else is a bonus.
Trincao is on 🔥🔥🔥 soon he’ll become one of the best for Barca
Messi Messi messi barcelona best in the world club
Messi was robbed of a hat-trick
Didn’t score a goal today but still got two assists
Messi was as masterclass as ever, and Trincao hitting back at the haters with 2 impressive goals. This is the Barcelona we all enjoy
Let’s play like this against PSG 🔥💪🏽
Messi, influential throughout the whole game. His game is not centered around tap-ins and penalties. Levels gentlemen.
what happened to ronaldo the goat today?😂
Damn a lot of credit has to be given to koeman
Barca just had one of there best games this season so far. Messi and Trincao brace. Grizzy 2 assists and Illax 1 assist. Barca is 🔥🔥🔥
Koeman boys
The fact that lliax moriba has more assists then hazard
To think Messi and Trincao almost had a hat trick...
the ONE and ONLY GOAT 🐐
Barca have scored the same amount of goals this game like hazard has in his entire Madrid career 😱😱😱
He is just the goat🐐⚽️😴
what was that? pessi? finished? messi heard and laughed😂
Messi proving that he is the real 🐐
i see you messi, you legend, getting ready for psg😏
The fact that trincao is scoring more than hazard
Vamos Barca 🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS MY BARCELONA. FORCA BARCA!!!
🐐
Messi masterclass. He could have had a hatrick of goals and a hatrick of assists today
The speed.
I really gotta work better on my aim :/
Ilaix showing fraudverde how it’s done
