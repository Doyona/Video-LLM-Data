I watched this video 4 years ago and laughed on every second of the video, four years later I am laughing every minute on this video. Such I great video I got a lot of nostalgia watching the video I really liked back! Thank you!
at 13:32 youtube started buffering inexplicably and i waited for a solid 10 seconds because i thought it was part of the video
0:00 geometry dash mentioned
why not 69k blocks ):
weaponize it
While im watching this video, he has 420.000 subs  No im not kidding
Goated vid
i will do it in hardcore , promise ,
I wonder how much damage you’d take if you crashed into a ceiling above those crystals.
Elytra flight seems very susceptible to forces that add to the player’s speed. Check out what happens when you use a Riptide trident in the rain with and without gliding. With another player pulling me in with a fishing rod, I once “jumped” 1100 blocks forward from the ground, with no fireworks or other forces.
The remixed versions of the minecraft soundtrack in the background hit kinda hard ngl
10:07 "make my own gas killing chamber" 💀💀
Fun fact: Minecraft players have a terminal velocity when falling. He could have just flown like 300 blocks up and practiced the MLG from that height before trying the real thing as falling from that height allows you to reach the same speed cap as falling from 60k would.
Seeing the old netherrack textures was so nostalgic.
“I flew to the the end portal for the purpose of entering the end portal
*builds insane mob farms* *survives a month in the void* *builds more insane mob farms and erases an entire desert from the face of earth* *jumps 60.000 blocks in the sky* *misses an optional water MLG* *dies* *loses everything and corrupts his world* What a legend
I'm in your walls
i havent luaghed liieek this at a video in a whileee

This should be a way to go to space in modded
Hey. Are you a girl?
shulker craft is dogshit and steals farms dont endorse >:(
11:17 69420
the GD community is proud to say we are in a Minecraft video for a second lol
hte amount of editing effort put in each second of the video is unbelievable
this dude is lwk such a math nerd lmao.. eulers formula and binom analysis😭😭 bro is definitely a applied math major
Im literally doing the same thing but only so I can explode the end city. I have over 8 double chests worth of ghast tears, ender pearls, glass, abut only 6 double chest worth of blaze rods. Blaze farms are ineeficient as f
Dude your video feel like an ad-ridden site, it's very hard to watch
Imaging going 5km a second
When r/arabfunny makes mincraft videos
With this i made an end crystal TNT cannon
9:21 legend says he is still saying “required” till this day
I like how at the very start their is like 2 seconds of GD on the screen, nice!
Me who flew 90k blocks by accident when hitting atleast 200 crystals.
As of this comment, the amount of likes on this video, is the same as the altitude he went to! Amazing
You can use a sand duper
Ruben Sim is pretty cool
BRAVO
Ah yes the pinultamite plan
I love the AI voice it makes it 100% funnier
🤓um actually you went 59,300 blocks into the air, which is 200 blocks more than you have mentioned in the title.
I wept when you missed the mlg
Cocomelon?
Now I can achieve the ad astra advancement from blaze and cave
Next video ....he will touch the 69000 mark
Rick may is proud of this rocket jump
Can anyone give some kind of tutorial on how portal works in ghast farm as they can’t just automatically enter it and get to the overworld.
Love the video but about Shulkercraft... he's just stealing redstone builds from other people (sometime copying it wrong)
Sometimes I think this channel is just a bot thats automated so good that it plays minecraft and searches random sounds and images for those videos-
I got over 100000 blocks jump 2 yrs ago with crystals
1:02 the youtube algorithm shows that he loves cocomelon
1:27 can't you just use a totem of undying?
10:30 the ghast died of suffocation due to poor teleportation from the nether to the overworld
Imagine if he landed the clutch
Let's get 59k likes
when you did the jump the edits made it look like the most epic thing i have ever seen in a minecraft video
it's funny that he did it straight away!
How does this human not have more subs
The Ymfah of Minecraft
bruh
bro its sully  the hypixel skyblock melon duper
I got like 110k in one jump from wayy less crystals in 1.19
i made a 100,000 block jump in bedrock with end crystals, it was in survival but the end crystals were generated
ive made 100,000 block jump with end crysals. it was in creative tho, i didnt fly
The mfw (my face when) gets me every time I see it
3:47 😂
Nice
TNT minecarts tho??
Can u show us what happens when u swich the virsions without ur methoud
Yes ladies and gentle mans steve does all those things :^)
I had an idea: could you not just get a texture pack of the current textures for 1.11 cause ew old netherrack texture?
An very easy endfarm makes over ....lots of enderpearls op one is useless one very easy one shulker craft made is one of the easiest and best farms somehow?????
C'mon, bump it up by 10 kilometers. *Exactly 10...*
You madman
Kinda sad he didn't used interstellar music at the launching
now do this this horizontally
GAS GAS GAS
On bedrock you can do even more with those end crystals and go 100000 blocks up without 1000 of them
He literally jumped 7 times higher than M.T Everest
Great video and project but why are you using this fucking annoying robot voice?
Not hating but you could have used sweet berry bushes with dirt and hopper minecarts
mans playing skyblock without playing skyblock with that much grinding
I am litterally dying of laughter while watching your content.
I'm sorry but... this is called "flying"
Bet I can beat it challenge me
If I recall right the limit to Crystal yeeting yourself in bedrock edition is about 64,000 blocks
doing a tnt dupper and moving all the tnt to an uncharged chunk you could have over 10k tnt in the same chunk, then throwing an enderpearl to that uncharged chunk while having a little pilar to make the enderpearl collide while using elytra could shoot you into oblivion. over 80k blocks high.  this could be patched btw
Finally, a reliable way to escape my base şn case of a cathastrophe
This is a alpha male at it's peak
11:45 what about librarians
My man has the best editing
cannon
5 months 872k 55k 1.7k
Looks like you don't like your own voice just like me 🙂
I like how he doesn’t care about totems but cares about emeralds
I beated your record i go by alots of name i have did it 71192 thousand high
7:31 In the serach bar there is "Hindi subtitle"
It would be really cool if he reaches 69,000 Y
god editing
ShulkerCraft steals tutorials and builds.
I love how much time you spent doing something that will never be practical.
we have some things in common your a youtuber im not you got up 59k+ blocks i have 55.785ping :D... help
you should have used auto smelter to smelt glass it not hard to build and normally smelts a stack super fast
Imagine that arrow compared to a chunk!!!
Good content with gen z humor  Its this guy
the which requires part made me shit buildings
E to the power of an imaginary number multiplied by the diameter of a pecometer
Your a legend
i just got too high like 102000
Can you go up 69 blocks by end crystals.
SHEEEEEEEEEEEESH
im pretty sure that IGBLON uses mostly the songs from c418’s Excursions album
I know how many names he goes by to know just check his sub count the number of subs he has is the number of names he goes by and to make him go with more names sub to him
So basically you have travelled 60k metres or 60 km (37 miles). You were extremely halfwayto space as it it is 100 km (62 miles). Good job brother
Keep up the good work bud
U could use totem to not die
I went 100,240 blocks high and hit the top of the world in creative and I'm doing it again right now...
Background music makes me nostalgic bro
Make the commentary your voice
MFW (my face when) I survive 100 milliseconds in earth
Damn I forgot about this channel for like 3 months, glad this showed up randomly in my recommended
This editing is way too messed up lol
ccountries:*spend months making rockets to lunch it to see the outer space* This guy: *HAHA FARMS GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*
111000
i went to 11000
Next: he goes to space  (The space line is about 100km irl)
How did you edit this video😵
69420 blocks?
6:30 was so hilarius about the endermite
You just opened the path to break your number😈 It will be a measure of time until someone passes it 😎 Get ready 😘
I wonder if he built the launcher in the ocean, would there have been a difference?
His score was insane
Do the mlg bro
I can go 100k
Houston we have a problem. How to go back?
Space Capsule was invented in 1961 People before 1961: Water bucket

Oo
Where Divine Journey 2?!
1:40 in this vid man did insane clutch against a hacker
What a Waste of time! dislike!!!!

Rip 15000000 scores
You are going to be famous soon
this guys editing style is a fever dream
POV: you’re the manhole cover above the nuclear detonation test site

No cap, the failed 59k MLG sent my sides into orbit
Is that a Ruben sim clip in the first 2 seconds
How bout using end chests too
He gave up everything, just to entertain us one more time.
*Dies and loses 1600 levels*  Minecraft: Best I can do is 7 levels.
L just use a totem instead of peaceful
brah, I am sure you have a beautiful voice, please use it.  If you cannot use your voice for some reason, I am sorry, but I would just like to hear it

fun fact about the sand: shulkercraft made a sand duplicator
9:25
Congrats to everyone who has found this comment ♡
OMG YOU ACTUALLY MAKE IT
Pro tip: if you need a small amount of wither roses and don’t want to build a farm, spawn the wither in a ocean and it’ll kill all the passive mobs like fish and squid that are around.
This channel is so God damm underated dude u are supposed to have millions of subs
This dude makes minecraft videos that look like documentary but with bot voice and shutterstock images
10:36 this is what the crew of MrBeast feel like
Imagine not using a super smelter
Crab game in beginning xD
Now we know who won the space race
Your channel is the definition of r/ihadastroke
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
We Waitin' For 69,000 Blocks Jump
Didn't you say jump not fly (I'm only at the start so I'll edit this if I'm wrong)
E to the power of negative imaginary...
The 2nd vid at the start is RBLX
Why didn't you just make a sand farm so you don't have to destroy a whole desert.
10k bblocks short of greatness
Shoulda gone for the MLG ladder clutch. Probably would have landed that.
Throw an Ender Pearl while your at it, and reach the far lands.
I love this channel.
Wither skeletons require a fortress they don’t require wither flowers
0:01 what about terraria
numero uno numero dos numero tres
Remember to subscribe E to the power of negative imaginary number times a micro array parameter delta p 1 to the p plus delta p 2 to the p integration absolute value of square root of delta p 1  to the 0 of p 2 over p 0 1 p 0 2 times summation of rho 1 and d function j 1 from rho 1 to rho 2 W delta p 1 array delta j 2 variation of the W configuration of delta p 2 dot dot times function of delta p 1 derivative of rho 1 prime of delta p 2 times!
0:22 It Says Cheats Means Surviving 1 Month In Void Is Fake
Why don't you use totems?
lol geometry dash first game in the video
Gd 😎
This guy has to be hands down the smartest most dedicated productive Minecraft Survival player I've ever seen
This guy mixes 21st century humor with documentary and makes it funny
IGoByLotsOfNames - 1000 endcrystals 2b2t - 1000 shulker boxes of endcrystals
Thats really good im sub👍
voice reveal?????1?1?1?1?
ok now do it again and actually clutch :)
wmeow
52 wither roses woulda really easy to get js 😭
This video was absolutely hilarious
A man flew into the sky in Minecraft city.
Easy way to do a water bucket MLG: hold down right-click the entire fall until the game does it for you due to the way Minecraft’s engine processes clicks.
I have gone way higher than that
fun fact: even if you jump this high, you still won't be able to see the entire world, from border to border, for that you would need to be atleast at ~ 10000000 ~ and have far plane 2 to be able to see the whole world.
Brain aneurysm bruh moment 7:01
You could have just used entity cramming to kill the ghasts automatically.
In bedrock edition you can't get killed by end crystal's if stacked in one block so in bedrock edition you can launch yourself in the sky without changing the game difficulties
3:03 *stealing
Why you got so many levels?
$w@g™
ARE YOU CRAIZY!!! he:umm YEAH
So funny also did I hear portal 2 music lol
Bro he has the best editor in the world he has the world record
Best MC channel, all my respect for you!
U r 1m iq
I tried this when I was bored, I used this next to my friend while he was building than he freaked out and left the game 😂😂
This voice ruins the video bro use ur real voice..
I have question. Would tnt minecarts work?
I dare you to break a 100 by 100 area of bedrock with contraptions! Lol, scicraft did a 1000x1000 area.
its not low quality its comedy
Who are you 🤔
What if he succeded the low orbit water bucket mlg Dream: 😢
this is not minecraft this is MATHCRAFT
Let's take the moment to appreciate how effort he puts into the content for us☺
Yo what the thock
Highest Minecraft Jump is 59,000 blocks which is a world record
This is a nuclear assisted launch Not jump
Wait Did you did you respawn while it's 1.11 😶
Living legend
With that much power you may be able to break bedrock ( I believe their is a explosive cap to it along with obsidian
Twr
To put it into perspective that is bacically from one world border to the oposite
all u had to do was to just place blocks on the out side of the portals like a portal trap and they’d die of suffocation. the items might go in the portals but that makes afk rates faster bc all u need to do is place a hopper mine cart under the portal all the items go in and you can afk in the nether so u have no overworld mobs clogging rates
10:08 His what lmao
A lot of blocks
lol he was only 60% of the way to space, The beginning of space is at about 100 km
Why not 69 it wouldve been great for the Title
9:13 which requires which requires
This guy is skilled with text to speech
TO MUCH STEP XD
In minecraft bedrock end crystals are more op than Java
I will name you jeff
The ghasts probably suffocated in the obi box
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ha ha ha ha gg ha ha ha😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
this shows how strong steve is literally call him god
THIS GUY IS INSANE
Does anyone notice that this guy is using text to speech btw love your vids bcs they are so stupid and random and you are so funny and have an amazing sense a of humor
The ghasts might have died of suffocation
Can u pls boost it up to 69k, cuz it’s my lucky number :))
Haha
I love clickbait circles/arrows
great content
This guy does things most players couldn't do in creative mode.
fun fact: you can disable blaze spawner spawning using glowstone as the light source
"How much sfx do you want?"  Igobylotofnames: *YES*
Steve is a superhuman
0:15 reminder: one block is AN ENTIRE METER
nice video
It probably took him forever to do all of this, and it only bought him 15 minutes worth of content
You're just crazy.
Damn this has to be the penultimate survival challenge for sure
Steve is the best Video game charter
I saw scratch
14:02 why the portal 2 ost
10:40 Survive
yes
i have been here since 15k =)
Hey, can you make a toturial on how to locate end cities?
3:07 This gave me Nostalgia
@Connor Rugg “21st” century it’s not 2121 it’s 2021 key numbers “20”21
ohh crab game gameplay
"poisonous flower prank"      wait a darn minute-

Mumbo would be proud
2b2t players be like: Our new king!
2b2t kits be like : 12:09
This is just soo epic!! This guy is a legend!!
I forgot this guy used to play Geometry Dash lol
Endermen to the iphone pie plus one equals zero 😳😳😳😳😳
I sometimes wonder why I don't have a lot of subscribers, then I see the amount of effort this guy puts into his videos... Then I understand why I don't have a lot of subscribers :/
Your video edit is very good... WHO IS THE ******* EDITOR IMPOSTOR???
Flat earthers  when seeing thumbnail: SEE I TOLD YOU! THE EARTH IS FLAT, ITS MINECRAFT EVERYTHiNG IS REAL
I recommend Polish YouTuber film about its. (Roxmb) He goes up to miliona od block
You did all of this to jump higher blocks
"Most game characters can only jump 1 or 2 blocks."  Crab Gamers before the Xmas Update: *Allow us to introduce ourselves.*
youtube gettin real comfortable with these 2 unskippable 15 second ads
this would be useful traveling 60k blocks sideways but you do that and at 20k blocks you crashed into a mountain
my humor is broken
I'm become ur fan bro
igblon
Fun fact: overpowered end crystals work on bedrock
Also too much tnt exploding at the same time and place will stop your momentum after a bit. Idk why but it does. Ik cause I created a ginormous tnt duped arrow cannon with thousands of tnt.
5:51 wait a second... What sounds familiar
Best mc youtuber ever
This is peak gaming
You acctually miss the chance to be the first person to mlg from 59k blocks high in survival mode 😢
Ahhh dang cant u do the greatest mlg water bucket ahhh come on if u did that u could have goten a world record
imagine not remembering to hit record
F
congrates to everyone that found that command sub to me pls
i love watching your vanilla playthroughs they are muy buen
You should just use a auto mouse program or keyboard program (modify the mine key to a letter like b) to hold down the button long enough to mine at least one block with unlimited repeating and 10 microseconds between each interval
Use an enderpearl, it launches u straight up.
Outro? Amazing video btw
I love how he is making a cool video documentary but he makes it hilarious at the same time
Pls use less sound effect. It's so annoying!!
You can go higher in bedrock edition
*Which requires-*
Felix Baumgartner laughed at the end
The ghasts probably died because of entity cramming
I see how easy it is while dupinf and getting it from creative mode
Fun fact i tried this before i saw this video but in creative mode bc i knew in peaceful it doesnt do damage but i did it and jumpe high
"Imagine flying to world border from that height."
That pyrocinical vid was awesome tho
The editing is just next level 💯 every nanosecond he had done editing 👍🏻 This video is so messed up
69000 will be good 👍🏻
Keep being a legend
I kinda jumped more than that when I spawned 10000 withers in the bedrock in the end
7:30 Hindi sub ??? Are you Indian
Cmon dude is a little obvious you're the sciencephile the AI
If this man used his real voice he would be like the best mc YouTuber.
GEOMETRY DASH
you could of made a non entitie see mod it will not lag you out and you could spawn more then like 50k
59k nothing 69k good
But can you glide from one border to the opposite border? Or fly without touching the ground?
If 1 block equals 1 meter then you are 60% to space
man went to my pfp and back
I watched Mumbo Jumbo's Hermitcraft Season 8 (whole gimmick is not manually killing anything) and the death part was just from ghasts suffocating in the nether portal. It's either that or just entity cramming
clikbait1!1!11!1! titel says jumping but you actually flew case of eltyra111!1!1!1!1!!1! 😡😡
My new favourite mc youtuber
ommmmmmmmg
The ultimate rocket jump
Let just appreciate the fact he sacrificed 1632 levels with no second thoughts for our entertainment
I actually thought you would make the mlg clutch
OMG
Play the cursed error 422 version of minecraft and beat it pls
Imagine how long it took to get all the things and just to see the mlg failed
13:08 imagine if he accidentally touch the crystal
I don't think he can pull off the mlg
Why you show tooo much game
new 2b2t meta
Amateur, I jumped 69,420 blocks high
dude this guy is a Legend
ok now you gotta try the Create: Above And Beyond modpack
LIAM
he has barely any subs and look at how much work he put into this video
tu video llego asta la argentina pa
"Poisonous flower prank" lol wtf 😂😂😂😂😂
This is the type of channel that really confuses the audience but it’s entertaining at the same time, mlg like for you 👍🏼.
I fμcking love that editing
but you just fly with elytra
so technically  if you played 2b2t and there is no duping plugin Just imagine how hard it is gonna be to obtaining an end crystals or even making it this just mind explosion' right there
Play uncharted territory 2 bc i just had nostalgia
Hey dude just curious, do u remember grass
Y didnt u just use sweetberry bushes instead of wither roses?
quick reminder: Steve can jump 1 meter
pinned comment speedrun
nooo why you lost anything
this is what i call dedication wabba lubba dub dub
/tp @s ‘ ‘ ‘60000
You only have one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Wtf I just watched
I am a fan of shulkercraft
This dude deserves a lot more, his effort is too much compared to other big youtubers
Yo this guy is a real minecraft genius
fun fact: irl this is about 60% of the way to space, so he is not even that high :p
good job going 59k meters into the sky (each minecraft block is one meter tall in real life lol)
I'm glad that you included Geometry Dash
Es epico amigo
I DON'T MEAN TO DISLIKE BUT I FIXED IT SIR MAM PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FEEDBACK 😱
ok now do something previossly thought impossible again  soo we can all be like wow thats amazing, please...
If i can believe that you build all these shulkercraft farms in survival, because I did it too, How you manage to do this in ~40 days? I took me like 800 minecraft days
12:10 whats the song?
Snoop dog can get higher
ok
why don't you get to the world border on a strider
Do it in 12 with farplane 2
duuuude somuch efort
Bro wtf... This guy is the real 1000 IQ player. Dang...
How tf could a person be so dedecated 👏👏👏👏👏👏
It would be cool if he or she gave  themselves 1,000 hearts before they fell, to see how much damage you would take from that fall lol
i hope someone gonna make the 59k clutch oh wait i did it lol
You make the harder and ur contact is cool
song at the jump was very fuckin' scary
How to go to space in Minecraft: Turn off fog See infinite chunks in minfat Spawn 1 nanillion end crystals Turn on creative Make trillions of tnt farms Buy Millions of rtx 3090s Make your pc and screen 100x bigger(especially don’t make it fall) Explode the end crystals and tntsss Proceed to be stronk You will be happi Ensure you take a lot Of elytra and fireworks Now ur done Agree to me and I will give you polish cow

Shulkee craft sucks btw
I like how the first scene was geometry dash and thought it was an ad
What if you go sideways???
I dare you to do 69k blocks
I went 100k blocks up in pocket edition. What I did was use repeating command blocks, I used 5 repeating command blocks and then summoned end crystals all at 0, 0 and then waited for a while and then jump on top and then blew it. I’m went so high up that it stopped letting me go higher at 100,427. I was just stuck there.
i can't stop watching lol
Yo dude the geometry dash icon is the icon i have equipped lol, but the colors ate different
You should try this with tnt minecarts. It might be hard to keep yourself alive but it is worth trying.
u are op but why are u doing this
/Tp @e 65,000y 40,000x
6:07 was the sound of a Minecraft music track that gave me a few nostalgia
Couldn’t be just use a totem to not die, regardless of the difficulty level
You're such a legend !
Go to the edge of the world next please
Skyblock player escapes and becomes popular? Gg
Teacher in Minecraft be like :

Can you try beating the game in adventure mode?
Yup this proves that you can’t go to the moon in Minecraft despite the countless click baiting videos saying u can.
why not 69k
when u take a joke seriously
pls unban me your discrod pls i didnt do rong :<<<
Obsidian ghast? 9:03

I love how 59k isn’t space
I love it
If u do it on bedrock u could get even higher , i got over 300k of just placing end crystals for 16 minutes and then Just hitting with my hand
what is that text to speech voice name?
funi
He's so high! What is he on??
how he gonna get down
is igblon changing the name of this vid?
2b2t players be like 12:10
This is a very well made video, but just do be aware that Shulkercraft is kind of well-known in the technical/farming community of Minecraft for copying and sometimes outright stealing other people's farm ideas and simply posting tutorials for them (for example I noticed that the obsidian farm in this video is from an older Gnembon video). He does give credit most of the time, but the links are burried in the descriptions and he rarely mentions them in videos.  Its a common tale in the YouTube and espectially the Minecraft YouTube space, but I think it would be better to not give this "creator" more attention than he already has.
what if this guy is just an ai programeded to do crazy things?
Why does this whole video feel like a sh** post
Lmao I play in mcpe and just threw an enderpearl into the end crystals and got to 100k
These edits are gold
he did it again
11:27 why the heck is bedless noobs old cam there xD wtf
ok first: very nice video, i dont konw how i landed here but nice  second: i have a question, what do you have to press to get all (e.g.) cobblestone from your inventory in the chest with only one click? pls help .-.
I dare you to get to 100,000 blocks or 100 kilometers which on earth would be in space
7:32 IGBLON INDIAN
Crazy good edit
The amount of time that goes into these videos
I just reach 70,000 blocks high only using elytra good luck of passing me ;)
59,000 blocks are nothing I got to 72,000 blovks
F
You can place multiple end crystals on the same block and then just destroy it
This is so entertaining, I love the editing style and the bot voice choice. Everything fits perfectly and makes an awesome video
You are an hard working guy. Love your vids. Mr. Beast also said in his beast react vid that he also loves them who dedicates their time on this stupid things. This was a compliment.

420k views.... noice
I Jumped 59,100 Blocks High In Minecraft Survival 420,000 views Nov 28, 2021     u should have jumped 10k more blocks
Next challenge: Jump 10,868 long blocks
Umm sir i jumped 100000 blocks
ok just ok not like you can try higher then that (or you can’t do that)
Let's see how many people knows that the title was changed from " I made 996 end crystals to do this..."
Breed 100000 villagers
Isn't that you fly instead of jump
This was 12 seconds ago…
7:29 hindi Subtitle 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
1.18- minecraft nerfs elytra (every time a rockets used it loses durability but can glide without losing durability) IGoByLotsOfNames- makes elytra travel faster then light speed (since im guessing u can also go down, left, right etc through the end crystals not just up)
That 2600 is D Y I N G
only legends remember what the original title was...
14:40 ??
Isn't this possible in non-peaceful using a totem? 🤔
I've gone higher with tnt minecarts you should try that
The creativity and the patience to this challenge is just so amazing. You deserve million more subscriberss mann
i cant stop wheezing
This was so entertaining
Amazing
the reason why the ghasts were dying was prob because they were killing each other or entity squishing
Dang
DUDE THE MUSIC DURING THE ENDERMAN STRAW HAS ME CRYIN
imagine what clownpierce would do with 1000 crystals......
i bet you he purposely put the title like that just to piss us off
the text to speech sounded so realistic at the start to me
igblon watches ruben sim? oh yeah its time to get funky
next:I take all lava using bucket  1000 block
Ghast might have died due to entity cramming
That fact that he made 996 instead of making 4 more makes me so triggered
Stereo madness
.
Crazy that he only reached the 3rd level of the atmosphere still really impressive though
Viewers (I guess): Did you do it? IGoByLotsOfNames: Yes. Viewers: What did it cost you? IGoByLotsOfNames: *Everything*
this is definitely my fav mc youtuber now
You.
after watching this video, i have a headache and feel a stroke coming
I have done this before
*And thats how he lost his survival world becuz hes too high*
you are definitely the type of guy to be in the Greater China WeChat Community Worldwide discord server
alright, hear me out, this guy is sciencephile the AI, along side many other channels, which would explain the name "I go by lots of names". He also does the sciencephile bad editing but funny 100% identical and cant forget the computer voice. of course someone could find out how to do thosee things, but this is my way of saying that I'd not be surprised if a bunch of channels with this type of video showed they are owned and run by the same person. Also would explain sciencephile's terrible upload schedule...
good shitpost
Entity cramming?
This is a sick vid, is there gonna be a world download??
the ghast's died because of entity cramming
I got to y100.000.000 by using a knockback 32576 bow for 48 hours straight while flying an elytra
LÓÓÓÓÓL
I mucked around with end crystals a while back when I was into Crystal PvP.   59k? Rookie number. I'm already on my way ;)
bro the editing XDDDD
any people watched video before title change?
can you please tell what "text to speech" app you use??
You changed the title
Since when was low orbit only 59 kilometers?  That's still way in the atmosphere
This video was poggers
Epic
do u know you can made the same thing with TNT minecrat? but idk if you can survive...but that's simple with my friend we make a 32 000 blocks tall jump with between 100 and 200 tnt minecart only!!
Can /tp 0 1000000 0
Subscribe now
THIS GUY IS THE BEST
plz turn that world into a siries
Or he could just used a totem instead of peaceful mode but whatever
You just earned a new sub  Good work kep it up
u u change the tittle from jumping 59.000 in minecraft
7:02 college moment
This was 27 minutes agoo
Soo much efforts 🥰👍👍👍
When U use youre brain
another great challange style video these ones seem to be your best uploads and make the channel grow! keep up the great work!
I mean yeah but... It's technically not a jump
that was insaaaaane man goood job
3:15 is this a tpot reference
Hey.Are you a girl?
Probably my most favorite channel, surprised he isnt close to 1 mil yet
This guy is break world record of most hight jump in gameming history
There is actually an easier way to build the ender man farm and more efficient
To infinity and beyond!
what a masterpiece
In bedrock edition If you just use a repeating command block that summons end crystal and hit it while in creative it literally sends you to the shadow realm, where even if you try to tp it will continue to send you up at 100,000 blocks per second, and also causes a unstoppable explosion that pushes anything away from it(including creative mode flying) and destroys all projectiles
Did u know u can jump high on roblox by typing :jump 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 If u have admin 😀😀😀
yay Luvonox
ZAMN 😍 A GOOD YOUTUBE VIDEO
so would it be possible to do this diagonally to see how far you could go?
1:29 music title?
Oh my gosh the Papa Louie game... that hit me in the heart
I love the first game 0:1
try to reach the world border maybe?
NICE.
...walk... to the world border... in survival mode... in the over world...
I WANT MORE STUPID AS HELL CHALLENGES
Fun fact: if you look slightly under strait up with an elytra, you will go way higher
ElRichMC: i'm going to create more than a hundred of ender cristals for my bedrock tower, and nobody can stop me MC community: we not but he can This guy:
the commentary and the editing 🤣🤣🤣
IGoByLotsOfNames lore be like:
your editing skills and timings are spot on  🔥
who remembers the original title the og title was "how i managed to jump 55000 blocks in minecraft"
Aiye wante voice reveal
Or maybe 5 blocks
this video is so cool! i wonder how it would sound like after voice reveal.
the dislike counter is finally gone for me
IgoByLotsOfNames:All of you amateurs can only jump 1 or 2 blocks but i jump over 50000 blocks
underrated
what is jumping truely
Try to get bedrock in survival and dupe it then
How far can you go from using this explosion and rockets afterwards
This reminded me of when i tried to make a rocket that basically pushes you out of the world i did that with 5 of my friends after we got lots of stuff my friend accidentally clicked on the end crystals destroying weeks of work after that we got so mad we gave up its been 2 years now i would actually love to try doing it again but with you so ill explain we gotta get 1000 end crystals and water and also elytra because this cannon is supposed to push you into the zone of the world where you fall thru the ground or the hit box of everything is broken its basically near the world limit also reaching the world limit is impossible since the elytra might glitch and make you fall thru world plus you wont be able to move since you will reach this zone called the stripe lands where the blocks are stretched and the trees are 2d and every mob instantly die plus you wont move so do you wonna try reaching that point? so we can proove that the player cannon works because when we tried to make this cannon we needed obsidian water 1000 crystals elytra so the water could give you a boost  and the elytra will give you more boost and the crystals would launch you
5:36 why does this (F3 screen) say "Day 14" Fake video? When you started the video you were on day 53...
Ok now fill your entire inventory with level 3 rockets and fly the highest you can lol
When he launched up it sounded like he was nasa
I dont understand the name change but the title is nice too
smh should have killed obsidian defenders for obsidian
Why didn't you make 4 more?
IGotLotsByNames: I made 996 End Crystals to do this... Internet rn: Nice 996
The way this guy combines 21st Century Memes with Minecraft gameplay and the genius of Jeremy Clarkson is way beyond perfection. Beyond mankinds imagination, give this man more Subs YouTube. 🤌🤌🤌🌍🌍🌍
try removing your elytra as soon as the explosion happens, maybe it causes more drag?
your like me i have a stupid idea i wonder if it will work and i try but the difference is you don’t give up
3:11 Wait what? Why is it in spanish?
Imagine a normal school subject but this guy is the teacher...
🤨
This guy is Genius!!!
Dude, shulkercraft steals designs, don't credit them, all they do is copy a design and make a block by block tutorial
Pamilyar voice btw your voice kinda look like bright clips
Fun fact: You can do this With TNT in any non 1.11 World, BUT If you wish to proceed The best version would be 1.16 As the Netherite + Maxed out blast prop + pots , Could allow you to last the initial Blast, But be aware You should be doing this KNOWING it could crash your PC if your PC can't handle the Strain, Fun fact 2 : this can also be done on Modded servers with stronger "TNT" , But keep in mind you'd want better armor before doing so,
"congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment
this broke my humor
This is why I like Minecraft. There is thousands of things you can do in it
You could have save time by buying some of the glass from villagers. Great video nonetheless
Love the sfx Lmaooo
the best shitposting video ever
Masterpiece
U have achieved an achievement "No life"
i truly respect you   because u didnt even cheat in this vid

Wow that must've been the best and worst show you've never seen
Just dupe the sand and connect it to th end
You changed the video title.
Чё
So the title name got changed
Wait, I had this on my browser for a bit, and have a question... Wasn't this called: How I jump 59,100 blocks in survival minecraft? So now it just spolied it for me :\ D:
I got to 100k up with levitation 100 and i waited for 7 minutes
ayo when did sciencephile the AI get a gaming channel?
*Legendary*
He ranboo
13:18 This explains the editing style 😂
Somehow the y cord is familiar to me.........
skyblock endgame players needing to grind something be like
can we talk about how he has 1600 xp levels?
Man I was cheering for you so hard at the end, truly wanted you to land that water bucket, but all and all, gg on the video
I like the sensory overload editing style. exactly the right type of humor for my overworked college brain
Why didn't you place a ghast minion?
i like the old title more
good thing you built that enderman farm tho
PLEAS KEEP DOING SURVIVAL
Bro what is the editing software?
halarios  WHO ARE YOU your so underated
ive done this before in bedrock edition and when you start going up you wont stop      also the sky turns purple
U r so much more dedicated than so many people
How has this man not hit 1m subs
c r a b g a m e
e e
Good. Now try jumping from one of the borders of a world to another with a single jump.
nice vid
He jump 59100 meters or about 18000 feet or about 9000 miles
I can finally make an elytra launcher instead of using fireworks
I wonder what editing software this guy uses
Just subscribed
Claim your Here Before It’s Viral ticket here!  |  | \/
what if you tnt jump into the crystals then hit them
How does he have bed rock
bro you can get infinite sand by making a redstone machine near the end portal and duping them, that's how we do it on my server
holly shit how are ur videos so good it has like 21st century humor but in good portions and on top of that the dantdm old outro song is the icing on the cake  I can see this channel at 1mil soon

When you realize you can torch up the spawner

You could have just farmed a bunch of chicken eggs and thrown them into a room to get chickens then fight the wither normally making enough wither roses. 52 is not a lot.
he said 59 kilometer, space begins at 100 km and low orbit 350, orbiting earth starts at 160 km and ends at 2000 km
he should get 591,000+ subscribers instead
300k less go
love it when igobylotsofnames uses the funny steve smash render in his explanations :)
11:45 don't worry he just dig up the whole Sahara
15:05  2nfg is now a channel member?

The ghast died because of entity cramming and so did some of there drops
Yo you got my name wrong .-.
Are you lie?
this guy is like technoblade if techoblade was a vanilla player
AAND THE GREATEST MINECRAFTER IS BACK
HE SHULD HAVE TRIED TO GET 10 K blocks higher
this is basially a very long shitpost.
This video made my day
Why didn't he just put a torch on the blaze spawner though?
the effort is so crazy this man is so insane
goat
*What if he forgot to record it all*
*Now jump 69,000 blocks*  1:45 "Clip i think it was from relic mc" xD

Is anyone else confused about why the day count in his f3 screen keeps changing?
The legend is back bois
Didn't get one thing...He still have a bread on hotbar...
Pigstep playing in the background makes this video 10 times better
Lol i didn't imagine anyone else had ever litened to excursions from c418
That portal 2 sound track was so fitting
Y0ur A GenI0us S0oo0 C0oI.
Watching pyros 8 hour video while placing end crystals seems so funny to me dunno why    *maybe because i watched it like 3 times*
Gotta love this guy’s editing! Keep the work up man.
How 2b2t player make their weapon:
Amazing video!
I think he is Indian
Using a large stack of striders, if you leash the bottom strider and then ride the top strider, the entire stack will begin moving upwards indefinitely
1:42 Oh, that’s me.  They call me gamer
hey, IGBLOT and I have the same cpu!
Ha, did it first.
great video as always
OOF that MLG
funny
Congrats on your 300k subs
My best ever clutch was a 10k block fall onto a stair. I did it accidentally and it was veryyyyy lucky. My friend recorded it, and shortly after his computer exploded (figuratively) lol. (It was like 7 years old and was ded by all definitions.)
I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited I like how he edited
7:31 I am an Indian also.
The amount of work done.🤯
u need therapy
enderman identity = euler's indenity enderman = euler?????
now thats how you get to y+++291
Can u attempt to go 10420 blocks higher than 59k?
~59,000 what?!?!
Dude I absolutely love your humour and your videos oh god ur my favorite youtuber of all time I'm not even kidding please keep this work up I love your videos very much
Hello LotsOfNames! Recently i got a challenge idea of [eating poisonous potato to survive in 1 minecraft months].  I think it'd be cool if you carry it out. Its ok if you're not interested in doing so, just suggesting. Have a nice day!
these are so good
Holy crap an actually funny minecraft youtuber, you get my subscription.
Next make every farm in the game
Haha tp commands goes brrrrrrrr
It's a fucking game! What's the big deal?
11:33 12:11 no way dude... IS THAT BINGING WITH BABISH CLIP???!! [real]          nice.
*1:34* Keep in mind that Red Orbs exist in GD That effectively quintuple your jump height. So it's not measly one or two blocks.
Lol I’ve done this before lol
Bedrock this is even more op. You can get up to y=100,000+. However when you get to that point you're game glitches and immediately stops.
That was only 996 crystals
Imagine he misclicked
Now glide to the world border
I lost it at "clutch from low orbit"
If that launch was not sped up then that means he was moving at an average speed of just under 6,000 MPH (9,677 km/h) going up to y=59,000
Ah man... Just another 10000 blocks
Pwlebkatbaixyomfc
3:16 i saw Two from TPOt
Well i jumped to the level Y69420
almost world record in survival minecraft XD
he should get a world record for doing the highest jump in minecraft
Too bad you couldn't make it another 10,320 blocks up
ima try this and good work
Social distancing be like...
big deal. playing games all your life will put you in nut house., oh you're there already... sorry
Man What a crazy guy
i bet this took SO LONG
Sub
fun fact: i accidentally jumped 2 million blocks on my minecraft server that breaks the server
but WHAT IS jumping?
This whole video was just sensory overload 1000
average 2b2t player pvp inventory
I can't wait to see what's next! you're the most patient person I ever know.
3:10 nostalgia.....
He is the most powerful game character now..,
u can just stop the blaze spawner while making the blaze farm with light sources while making the blaze farm so ur is less hell in hell
300K subs coming soon
i remember launching myself through the legacy console y limit barrier with tnt minecarts lol
time to be unfunny... IS THAT A GEOMETRY DASH REFERENCE?
If you have another person on the server on the other side of portal they don’t mysteriously die it is because when they go through the portal it makes a smaller portal in the way which then make it so the ghost cannot get out of the portal which means they suffocate. (Short example the ghost goes to overworld makes small portal and suffocated in it.
Ki
1k left for 300k gg
the ghast suffocated cus of how small the portal is
trending?!
Shulker craft and he said The Meaning of SIMP and some kid copies it and gets the glory without crediting shulker HAHAHAHAHA
the final step of the penultimate step of the penultimate final of the final penultimate of the step
It's ok if you didn't do the water bucket clutch

Great, hes back for random crap that for some reason make me addicted to his channel
Nice pfp
Cool
I did for 110,376 blocks
Bro this dude will probbally be a tryhard on a smp
Am i the only one who starterd vibieng at 05:43. Old memorys just rushed at me when i herd the theme just playing.
this guy, he just gets better and better, and somehow algorythm doesn't wants to really help him at all
How do you even stack end crystals it never works for me
Or just use gameboost 225  or somethint
Bro that amount of crystals isn't even enough to survive on 2b2t
I subbed okay
Make a ender dragon farm
Godspeed you magnificent legend, normally I instantly turn off AI voice vids, but this one was beautifully done!
Do more videó like that
So then I used a paperweight to hold down my left key-IGoByLotsOfNames F3+T : Am I a joke to you?
I like how you watched Pyros longest video while you waited... as someone who also watched it, I love both your channels.
HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND EDITING????????? :O
You are insane i love u
why is ur voice text to speech
The ghasts were being killed by entity cramming. If too many mobs are on one block at the same time, they will all take damage and die until 24 (default entity cramming limit) are left standing. This is to reduce lag and can actually kill you if you fall in.
tnt minecarts
I challenge you to build a city under lava, because why not
i like youre channel
You crazy son of a bitch you did it 👏👏👏
Sponsored by Shulker Craft
I belive your mknth void vid is fake cuz of it being 35 days you got all the resources in in about a hour and 20 minutes mhm so believable
i unsub and dislike cuz he didnt do the clutch
I was told this was     Make-Believe
phones can process more then 2200 end crystals!!
this is so amazing plz continue this series in this world make this the most accomplished world ever in random weird achievements like this
almost at 300k subs! You can do it!
lol
When divine journey 2 video.
The reason you didn't survive the water mlg is because your momentum is so large as you're heading towards the ground that you are travelling several blocks downwards per in-game tick. So if you were to make the clutch you would need to have a tick coincide with being close enough to place the water bucket. Because you were so high your momentum meant you were simply travelling downwards too fast...
more, More MORE!!
ur a legend
best guy ever
First video I've ever seen with no dislikes
He’s playing portal music at the end. What a chad.
Thanks for using my music :)))
:D
yayyayay
:
I love this editing
Subbed before 300k
14:30 portal music lets go!!
Is tht pinewood computer core in start
Oh you don't know crab game? Its basically squid game but more random and is made by a game developer called dani
I quit, you’ll never see this and you won’t do skyblock anymore. I give up. I waited for MONTHS for you to do it, under months of videos my comment was there asking “please do the ‘who spent the most real life money on skyblock’ video” because I thought it’d be SO cool to have a standalone video for that, and yet it didn’t happen. No economy video. I will always be subbed, kind of sucks that months of dedication and devotion went unnoticed though, no matter if I was out of state or busy I’d do it. Best of wishes igblon
thats cool and all, but tell me  when did you last jump in real life
You should get a guiness world record
The moment I saw this i was like -  Oh no he did this again, This mad lad
Could have made a sand duper
I jus have a question why
I love the Interstellar reference when they show the tier list... jumping with a black hole! :) Also, as an amateur editor, this editing must take SO long! The amount of stuff id incredible!
That final shot was amazing
mistress, wake up! igblon uploaded! (😍😍😍😍😭😭😰😰😎😎👿👿😈😺)
imagine if it was 69k blocks sos
Finally, here within a day.
In Minecraft I said: Only 1 crystal make me go to y=♾
man u need a 10mil sub for hardwork must take a lot of dedication to do something like this
placing a bed under the emdportal will give you free netherite and notch apple
That's technically not a jump since you "used" an elytra :/
this is a great vid but can u pls use ur own voice the audio already there is really anoying
If you make your own roblox game and set the jump power to like 99999999999999999 you will jump higer
Wow
Geometry Dash
I love he has done this and spent hundreds of hours on these amazing dumbass projects and still doesn't have netherite
846th Comment
Amazing!
hey vsauce, Michael here, how high can you jump. Bagels
This guy doesn't play survival. *_Survival plays him_*
make a hole in bedrock and do it backwards
At 3:08 the into song for Popular MMOs was played
The random Shutterstock images and pure chaos in his videos are just ...too *noice* ✨
this man needs an award
I always save IGBLON videos to my 'best of stuff playlist'
Steve can carry infinite because of water bucket
I did The crystal Duplicate than I activated them all at once and I flew 3 mil blocks no cap in pe
1.600 lv?
6:26 how is he in creative sus  But good video
3:02 Shulkercraft isn't creating good farms. he is using for example Rays Work's farms and gnembon's.
🗿👌
If only there was an extra 10,420 blocks....
i like the editing, good job, I'm waiting for the next video
Now redo all the things in minecraft bedrock edition
What is jumping? It's a temptation caused by a penetration
Man this prolly took him so long
use the crystal launch to go to the far lands
Good editing. Good video.
the guy who found a usage of enderpearls from enderman farm
This editing is so nostalgic :)
the reason the ghasts died when you didn't do anything is bc the room you put around the portal they exit was too small for their hitboxes and they suffocated. The person who original design of the farm had a killing chamber that was just well-placed blocks that suffocated the ghasts
*Can we all agree that when He uploads our days get better! 💖*
Bruh shulkercraft copies most of his farms from other technical minecrafters like ilmango
Just add 10,320 more blocks ;)
I see you like the portal soundtrack
Igblon is incredinle ytbr
Face reveal at 1M and voice reveal at 500k
I never thought about doing this in survival but I love to blast my friend thousands of blocks in the sky in creative mode using command blocks summoning end crystals. It is literally the most painful thing you’ll ever experience. After about an hour in the sky and an added 2 hours to the amount of lag u will be considered certifiably insane.
now get bedrock(get bedrock then dup it)
why would you even need a wither rose farm? why not just breed a bunch of chickens and spawn a wither on top of them
did he do all these or T.A.S
THIS IS GOLD!!
For anyone who got their dislikes removed, at the time of me writing this comment the current count at the time i'm writing this is _111_

dude, these videos are fucking insane, literally the best minecraft content on youtube at the moment.   if you ever wanted someone to do a voiceover so you're not limited by the text-to-speech thing, feel free to hit me up! :D
Most hilarious death I've ever seen in Minecraft
This dude is amazing guys
Do this but vertically :)
Why don't yoou go to farlands? (or you can't do that)
is nobody not gonna talk about how he used babish's cooking video for the background
What’s jumping? Ask your mom (SORRY)
MOre sub for this guy!!!
This is kinda cringe ngl
Love the music.
*crystal pvpers want to know your location*
challenges, memes, documentary, all just in a survival video, what the hell
CAN You please teach me how to edit a video this good? 😅😅
the best thing that happened in 2021 is people discovering your channel. This is amazingly funny and amazingly amazing
this man worked hours to die from fall damage, i've gotta subscribe to show respect you deserve it man
Gotta show this to @CaragBTW
did they nerf crystals?
in creative mode i did this and i got to 114 thousand blocks high even without the rockets
i love how he uses edited stock images -> comedic genius
Vsauce
scary sound
The gasts just suffocated in the obsedian
Yo we gotta send this to Mumbo Jumbo
fav video
Your A Bomber
*HOLLY SHIT!*  THIS GUY HAVE DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE
I have a question,     How the fuck do you escape from bedrock in nether  when you stuck in it
I played every single game that was shown in this video
youre a madman
I was about to ask why you didn't use totems, but they were introduced in 1.12 RIP
Crab Game cameo let's go Dani getting famous
How im 1000 blocks using 7×7 end crystals
The reason why some of the ghasts were dying without you killing them, is because of entity cramming.  Minecraft has a limit on how many entities can be in a block at a time, once that limit is crossed, any new entities in that space get dealt damage until they die.
Kracc backc minecraft
ive jumped 128 thousand or something blocks
You can press F2 + T for auto mining
BRO ROBLOX CAN JUMP 3 BLOCKS
Minecraft Space Program be like:
That is the equivalent of this lyrics in rao god  "Going up to u in supersonic speed"

Igbln humor is so good they made it a real thing and named it "21st humor"
Hello
Yo utopia video
homie could've done 59k water bucket clutch in pure survival
I love how there is mrbeast squid game in his recommended lmao.
The ghasts died because of entity craming and suffocating in obsidian of the portal
This robot voice is legendary
2b2t players be like : 1000? Rookie Numbers
this guy should get more subs for this amazing stuff
mumbo jumbo is shaking and quaking in his boots
14:40 oof
I like how IGBLON's videos have kept getting better while still somehow keeping the original quality I signed up for back when he was at 50k.
The reason the ghast mysteriously died was because of entity cramming.
your dedication to a minecraft challenge is insane
Dantdm old intro
I love this guy's humor
holy hell intelligent kracc bacc
You coudve just mine the end pillars for obsidian :D
milk
His yt channel grown up
My fav yt
Omg guys he made it to the moon I MA try this method but instead have a mod  that makes floating blocks and no build limit and make a space ship in low orbit and a launch station
This mans editing is better than trycs himself.
If you put 6 blocks of obsidian around the blaze spanwer they wont spawn
Can you make hypixel skyblock videos again pls ?
9:03 is that an obsidian ghast
Fuunni moment
The ghasts probably died from entity cramming
Legendary man
the reason why the ghasts are automatically dying in your custom made farm is because of entity cramming   basically, your farm is overloading the small area with a mass amounts of ghasts that it's actually suffocating em.
Holy shit  Is that a motherfucking  Geometry dash reference?
New Challenge: Destroy the whole obsidian wall which is in the older versions of minecraft the whole wall and find the huge pyramid and destroy it too in survival mode 😈😈😎
this whole video is jus sensory overload
This video was so enthralling!   Also, just a note for anyone wondering about the red arrow representing jump height, I’d say it’s depicted magnitude was exaggerated by at least a factor of 10 (probably on purpose for epicness, which I loved), judging by the 500 block pixels, the base of the arrow was 27,000 blocks wide, so the arrow should have been about twice as tall as it was wide for a to-scale representation. The arrow as it was seemed to represent a jump of more than half a million blocks.
claim your here before this man blows up and reaches 1M ticket here i guess              EOOk
Build city challenge  :troll:
when u spend ur life searching for stupid images so that u can make a video without revealing ur voice
me when sullylovesmellons (real)
First before a million likes and views
Every time I watch your videos it feels like having a stroke. Great stuff
/effect @s levitation 255
why not 10k 320 more blox man it would make it 69,420
The mysterious reason of ghasts death is entity cramming
I got even higher, and it took me two days in real life to land on the surface.  But this guys really makes me laugh even though I just discovered his channel.
This guy’s dedication is incredible
I've been in -26k in the void lol
9:18 *which requires (repeat infinitely)* ahhh yes, so basically Minecraft in nutshell
I like your normal minecraft challenge.
This is editing
Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
7:31 is this a guy indian?   *working hindi subtitles*
THE EDITING :O
This guy makes the impossible possible
Watching at 2am for authentic feeling
He can survive more weight
Why does this man sound like wall-E tech support?
Woah!
This guy deserves more likes
7:02 I swear I heard "microwave" in there
Dude says aforementioned every video
3:03 yeah shulkercraft is great, but they make tutorials, not farms.
World record
may i suggest a nuclear bomb next vid
meems i lauhg hahhhaaa but good jmup
He deserves so many more subs!
3:10  I have not heard that song in over 10 years
Hmm..
Hello!
You should use the "Item shadowing" glitch for a video. It would be really cool
are u indian._.
UWU
no one heard this guy this guy is just rumor but now he is reality
8:17 philippines???
Ok. I Don't wanna break the fun of wideo , but 1.11 didn't had fireworks  1.11.1 Added them. The only snapshot to 1.11.1 Added fireworks
ur editing skills need a nobel prize award fr bruh
We can calculate the escape velocity with he was traveling when doing the MLG
Fitmc would be drooling at the amount of crystals you have
if you dont get 1mil subs i will murder youtube                    (for leagal reazons that was a joke)
wanted this video
He watched the 7 hour video lets gooooo
10:55  1000 WHITE CANDY WHAT?
"... which requires wither skeletons, which requi-"
Wait in the discord part of the video was that the same sully as the sully loves melons guy???
Thanks for making this ma dude
Was that GEOMETRY DASH IN THE SCREEN
Igobylots of names please make a Minecraft video about star factory modpack
I made video about flying up with tnt using the end portal as all the tnt unloads when you drop it into it and then you jump into the end portal and can get launched to like y = 1m
r u indian ?
I wonder how long this took
one of the best minecraft videos I’ve ever seen, it’s criminal that it hasn’t reached the millions yet
For thé algorithme
Now we know he's Indian due to him searching for ghast farm with Hindi subtitles.
Bedrock players with end crystals: *Pathetic.*
YOU ARE NOW THE MINCRAFT ELON MUSK MAKE A TESLA
This guy makes a random joke and just actually did it and makes it even more sick
over 50,000 blocks high is enough to make going to Brazil,  Going to the outside of the universe
but why?
"Making videos intentionally good is hard, but making videos intentionally bad is harder"  Sun tzu - Art of war
the one youtuber whose subscribe segment makes me want to (i have)
So no ones gonna discuss about why he searched for "ghats farm" with "hindi" subtitles?
Amazing.
Next video: going past the world border
Jumpman
I love your work man, keep it up! Looking forward to the next video.
Spending hours on jumping in a 11 year old block game: life? What’s that? Friends? I have an enderman farm
The fact that he did all this is just incredible
now do it sideways.
why not just set game mode to peaceful while you build blaze rod farm. Peaceful mode was unavoidable for this challenge anyway?
So cool!
Whoa
7:03 omg are you m&m did you make rap god 😳
this is art
if your using elytras you could just get tons of rockets
these edits are getting better and better
*geometry dash*
roblox can lift inf
i think he has the most exp ever gained in survival minecraft cuz damn bro you have 1.5k exp
INCREDIBLY powerful energies in this one, keep up the awesome work (also if you're looking for more vanilla mechanics to exploit, have you considered ravager teleportation yet? :3c)
Now I have a way to temporarily leave society.
59200 actually
とりあえずすごいです！！
**tall**
Do it all again, but in hardcore
its still op on bedrock edition
ive done this before with repeating command blocks and crashed my console thus earning the name world corrupter cause it would corrupt my world
Nice
just suffocate the ghasts
I knew that you watched pyrocynical
this is the best survival world ever, change my mind
I know it’s from Minecraft but what’s the song and remix name at 5:47 ish
"wither roses, which require withers, which require, wither skeleton heads, which require wither skeletons, which require wither roses, wh..."  I got stuck on this before when I wanted to create a wither skeleton head farm! :o
This dudes humor is better than mine in a weekend
What is the dog doing?
If you used a Trident wig riptide while it was raining you could've gotten faster than fireworks.
Mumbo jumbo be like: “I could do it in one episode”
I think that you wouldnt need the wither rose farm, make a farm of any animal, then get looting three sword and get wither skulls, then summon wither next to animal farm
I always make this particular enderman farm on every SMP or survival world
Nice
I loved the Luvonox footage of Bedwars
This man is a legend
no why is jumping
you should have more than 1 million subscribers..... how don't you have 1 mill yet? your content is good, funny and you spend a ton of time on it
nice bro i am impressed i subbed
I want you to survive on air without elytras
you gotta go to the overworld border for a video
I have did it and I have video on it
Epik... I'm subbing
u must be our science teacher
For the glass, you could have traded with villagers using the pillager farm leftovers
Omg! You know hindi!
Ding sound effect count: 77 There weren't nearly as many as usual but this was a hard one to do. Pretty sure the ghasts die to entitycramming by the way. I wouldn't think there would be that many at once but I can't think of anything else it would be.
Do you think technically, if the render distance and fog and computer power wasn't a factor, that you would be able to see the entire Minecraft world from that height?
theres actually a way to make obsidion way faster from rasplin's vid
10:30 most likely portal suffocation
Love that synthetic voice and random unprofessional editing style
Oh my gosh the bedrock Minecraft track I’m getting chills
I like this editing style :D
"but you could've just gathered fireworks..." -  person who made igobylotsofnames to take it seriously
You got recommended to me again , and it was awesome!
Can't you just use a totem instead of doing it on peaceful?
Lol in pocket edition going about 20.000 blocks high will instantly crash the game (rip)
I'm so sad that this guy only have 296K subs, well it is so many, but.. yeah you know.
Do tnt minecart jump
god imagine you messed up somehow and wasted hours of work..
Imagine forgetting to record
it will cooler if you jump 69.420 blocks
This is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous! True dedication.
0:00 Now minecraft videos start with geometry dash gameplay xD
I did this on my x-box a while ago and placed the crystals for like 2 hours and went like 200k blocks up high.     p.s. I did this in June I think
im pretty sure the mason has a glass trade
im  sorry if this is offensive, but never use ur real voice unless it is exactly like the current one
Your dedication that you put in your videos and your challenges are immeasurable!
21st century humor + being smart + dumb and hard challenges =IGoByLotsOfNames
Cocomelon recommended lol
Didn’t he go to 59,200 blocks not 59,100 blocks?
New sub
Can someone explain the notch apples?
With the ghast farm it would have been more effective if u just got full blast Prot Netherite with a looting 3 sword and got a hacked client or farmed manually
By the way, those ghasts died without a killing system because they suffocated in the nether portal on the overworld side. Hope this helps you make more amazing content in the future! :)
A
Do we have an another hitler 10:08
this guy is crazy
Can you do n minin 10 chuncks for a video?
If you had 36 stacks of 64 shulkers in your inventory (can be easily done woth commands) they say the heaviest material is netherite, which is around 2140 kg in weight and there are 27 stacks inside of each shulker this would show as 64x36x(27x64) which is 3981312, idk where I went wrong but I got close
IGoByLotsOfNames can survive a month in the void, clear 60k blocks in a single jump. But I bet he can’t make a video without saying aforementioned.
And here we have the origin story of One Punch Man’s cousin, One Jump Man
Imagine this in the nether, fastest way to travel in mc
this guy is a gamer
Doing that MLG is almost impossible. After falling about 260 blocks, your character reaches terminal velocity which is basically the max speed that your character can fall. It is 73 blocks per second and you have a block placing reach of 4 blocks. So 73 / 4 = 18.25, meaning you are going to have to react and place the water bucket in one 18th of a second (0.05 second or 50 milliseconds). The average reaction time is 250 milliseconds and the fastest that people have is around 130 milliseconds.   TL;DR You are falling so fast that you would have to have a 50 millisecond reaction time to place the water bucket which is basically impossible.
very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very  cool
keep  it up voice reveal?
u could of just did this in 2b2t lol
Me with jump boost 255 and levatation 255 for 10000 seconds: Look what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power
Could you beat minecraft on error 422 mode?
He has cheats but hey, Thats okay he said without mods.
7:02 anyone else try to slow down the video to see if we had met the sub goal
LAUGHS IN POCKET EDITION
Real sully loves melons!!!
subscribed bro love the comedy
YOU YOU ARE FUCKING UNDERRATED GIVE THIS MAN  A MILLION SUBS RN
Shulkercraft doesn't make farms, he just makes the tutorials (he doesn't credit the creator either)
Do it again
He makes our day when he post :))
Lmaooooooooo nice
LAUGHS IN POCKET EDITION
I think I once broke 100k on bedrock with a repeating command block summoning end crystals for about 1 minute
Underrated
This man is goin to be big
Why do you go by many names?
YOOOOO
IGoByLotsOfNames is a fucking legend
Why did you do this
He’s putting so much effort that we are obligated by anonymous contract to subscribe to him.
Next time release Janus
nice vid
this guy grinding a 2b2t dupe stash in these vids
3:21 "poisonous flower prank" is the new tiktok trend
14:55
He’s so close to 300k
Igblon: I basicly had to excavate and entire desert. Grian: First time?
I actually did the exact same enderman farm about a year ago lol thanks to shulkercraft🙏
did i ask
Incredible
average minecraft youtuber video: acts professional to engage the viewers igobylotsofnames: 21st century humor, shitpost level editing, and slap an absolute beast of a goal to finish
Fighting blazes would have been easier with a chestplate
Someday your feat will be massively acknowledged and you will obtain your goal of passing yourself in subs.
Subscribed since you made geometry dash videos, and years later you haven't let me down yet.
This man are the only men i will not be mad by that mess edit
Bro I love your content so much, I can't wait until the algorithm makes you pop off into a multi-million subscriber channel.
if you just stand directly under the crystals and throw an ender pearl into it straight up, you can go to like 100,000
One of the best YouTubers out there
Ka ching
New bedwars strat
Quick question, could you list all of the names you go by?
TNT minecart
how did you get the seed without using cheats?? you showed us you used chunkbase
This is by far, one of the best channels today.
U can use otherside for the song
If it was me, I would have used cacti to kill the ghasts
Video idea : how much can steve eat
I likes how he says he gonna die like to not pass away
Wow
next challenge: I escaped the world border without glitches
where divine journy 2  good video tho
Favorite  part is switching version
Ur the best mincecraft utubr evr
I can’t imagine how long it must have taken to edit all of this you definitely deserve more subscribers for the time you spend on these videos
lol nerd actually thought he could do from 59k . It becomes literally impossible at 20k
This guy should have as much subscribers as dream
I've done 80,000  in bedrock edition using commands
At the end why were villagers from 1.14? Or he switched ver while being dead?
commenting for algorithm
Ngl I was praying for another video in this style. Keep up the great work! :)
for the ghsat farm you can make a suffocation chamber it does not require wither roses and it can also reduce the materials needed for the killing chamber that contains the ghast check out gnembons ghast farm for more info
I was here when there were 6.9K likes
Try to get to the world boarder
Try to break bedrock with end crystals.
This man is too dangerous to be left alive
This guy is insane and I love it
Do a challenge where players work together to keep a spaceship running
Where Divine Journey 2?
What is the website you used to get the end city locations?
That mlg would be awesome
Respect for this man.
This man can do anything in Minecraft, i respect that
great vid! you're very underrated!
I did this yesterday, let’s just say my pc did not like it
Dude when i first saw the thumbnail i thought it was a 2019-2020 tapl video
he needed experience to fix his items yet he already had 1700 levels
Jesus christ man, chill
cool
2b2t players be like: What a pitiful amount of end crystals
Why he didnt build the sand duper D:
Love vids like these
can we appreciate how igblon gives all the music he uses? Why cant every other youtuber ever do that!!
Spacr
Ok but why not 69000 blocks high lol xd
very goood video
It was 59200 blocks high
How u got 1657 lvl
song @ 6:03 ??
What a chad
This dude is the most underrsted creator in youtube
Bruh
Igblon
What a video, unfortunate that it had to compete with techno's stream
Him:goes to peaceful Me:totem Him:end crystal Me:/tp
how tho
Love the subtle pyrocinical reference
11:58 manually farms sand, when the villagers trade for it.
Not sure you should credit Shulkercraft, they aren't really the original farm creators for most things
This guy has literally created a new type of media and I love it
nice vid as always, aight gotta go bed it's 2 am
I have another challenge, Try to One-shot ender dragon
Next video: going to the bottom of the void in survival Minecraft
The monotone voice is just so funny
We need a geometry dash video
Man that recoil from multiple huge-ass mod pack progression systems are hitting you hard.
You used 50+ hours of your life just to waste them on a block game just to launch yourself high up. W h y
I fucking love these types of videos, please dont stop doing them.
11:11 couldnt you have just put torches on the spawner
This is just an idea but couldn't you use sweet berry bushes instead of wither roses
I can’t imagine how long it must take to edit a video like this.
This is called serious dedication.
You are the best. =)
Your editing is *perfection*
Crystal pvp…
I just want to say that your editing and humor are both S-tier and u deserve the incoming 1 million subscribers you're going to get
I touched the subscribe button
i open the video and see geometry dash. thats how i know it’ll be a good video.
go 1000 blocks in a second
307th
great video man please start posting daily :D !!!
THIS IS ONE OF THE SADDEST MOMENTS IN HISTORY THAT HE DIDNT LAND IT
Underated
THATS NOT WHAT PENULTIMATE MEANS
how did you get that high? a few years ago, when mumbo jumbo was messing with tnt player cannons, he discovered a sort of softcap around y=30k
Please anyone how is this style of intensity editing called 7:36 (also, great vid as always)
I feel like it would have been more efficient to use a supersmelter and a gravity block duper to farm sand and then smelt into glass. In all fairness though I am unsure if the block duper works in 1.11. This is still one of the best minecraft videos out there and you are still easily my favourite minecraft youtuber.
This is fake his day counter is only 53 Then when he makes the end Erdman farm it is 15 he is using /time set day so he cheated
This guy need sooo much more attention. Just look at how much time he spends to jump high
If we want to reach Mars. Make rocket engineer work on it but if we want to reach the next galaxy. Just make it a minecraft challenge.
yes but did u actually jump
Play planetary lol (minecraft modpack on curseforge)
Igobylotsofnames is the only person who has such stupid but funny ideas
the reasons ghasts were dieing was because of entity cramming. when there are more than 24 entities in one spot, the game will start killing them. this might be useful for you in later vids.
at 0:31 it says "What a waste of time... Disliked!" , Youtube removed the dislike buttons lol
I reached max height doing this in bedrock
Chad
CRAB GAMEEEE
Try swimming 1 week/month in lava without fire res
Kinda sucks that this guys editing skills are way beyond most peoples but he uses 21st century memes lol, it is very unique though.
I like the idea of you having a Minecraft world where you continuously accomplish ridiculous feats
14:39 RIP 1632 levels
big thumbs up ffor watching that 8 hour long video, it was awesome
By how many names does this guy go
Subed
Like the pigstep
Wow
me when i hear C418 - Beton
nodded playthrough
please let this vid blow up
you never fail to entertain
just put torches on the spawner...
Future archeologists are gonna have a field trip with this person's videos
For placing the end crystals, You could have used a fast redstone clock. Nice video though.
So this is how you make documentaries enjoyable   21st century humour
OwO
Try to build a huge mansion out of bedrock in survival mode
algorithm comment
I think in bedrock you go higher. (Not the snoopdogg high btw)
Shulkercraft steals designs from other people such as Scicraft, please don't give them credit.
In bedrock you can reach 1m+ blocks
underated af
Ruben sim clip in the first 10 seconds? This is going to be a good video
“In survival mode” shows a screenshot of cheats enabled world…
Ok
let’s go geometry dash b tier game but maybe a tier
30900 more blocks and you would have basically gone into space
I just wanted to say thank you for making my day better, keep it up, your videos are so dope! I love how much dedication you have and I wish you all the best!
yoooooooooo
Your voice is relaxing :)
Where’s divine journey 2?
so good
Crippling "aforementioned' addiction
Mr beast of mincecraft

10:25 the ghasts died because of entity cramming
Hey here's a fun challenge attempt to make a nuke (999 999 999 tnt)
proud to have played the mimic with you, guild H gang
The ghasts probably died of suffocating in the portal
YuM wHiEt CaNdEy CoRnZ
"I was going to do the 59 kilometer water bucket MLG, basically doing the clutch from low orbit" that sounded so badass.  shame it didn't succeed tho
This guy. He is just... A guy that has a lot of names... I wish i had other names
What a waste of time.. Disliked!
Hmm try to be the fastest player posible in survival mode
IGoByLotsOfNames: 1k end crystals Average 2b2t player: hold my beer
Comment for algorithm.
Hi!
Your videos are extremely good, it has 24 memes per second.
how he blends in 21st century humor with documentary makes it very entertaining
comment for algorithm, holy hell was this entertaining
OH WOW
pin pl0x
I remember me and my cousin doing this on a flat world one time
He is from India because whe  he searched to make an obsidian farm he wrote    hindi subtitle
This is a good Kerbal Space Program playthrough
fireworks can be used to get to 59k blocks but this much cooler
Put in 240p at 2 times speed for maximum quality.
7:31 proof he is Indian big love from India
you know what is the craziest part of this video?       he found a reason to play on the version 1.11
Beated This reocrd on bedrock bruh
7:41 crazy amount of gapples
nasa
1:35 I like that tier list of yours
Shrombie deth
I can say something about 21th century humor or editing... But I won't. It's just amazing
This guy is insane!
Yess!! These vids really are my personal favorites, just experimenting with vanilla minecraft
This guys videos are great I just Iove them
In bedrock I got to 100 k blocks from doing this
Hey! Great video! Very enjoyable and funny. What editing software do you use to edit your videos?
the mad man
You should play roblox and kill invertebrates
your vanilla MC challenges are truly the best. Looking forward for the next one
BRO HE FINNA DO A 59K BLOCK HIGH CLU- nvm
I LOVE these kind of (insane challenge) survival no mod videos. They are very funny and informative at the same time! you are one of the best minecraft content creators on the platform. keep up the good work.
heres an epok challange for you: dying in every way 100 times
Crazy
1 word... *poggers*
how many stock images are in his files

Your channel needs 100m subs
life changign
Amazing bro
Steve can jump 6 meters by drinking green water and he even survives drinking the water
alan eustace mad he lost his space jump record
Incredible! Thanks mate!
Please, NEVER change your video style and your editing style. I think everyone here will agree that this editing is very awesome.
yay! another vanilla challenge! honestly these are so good, the modded ones just confuse me with the different items
World Download?
Epic Video !!!
Im
How many names you go by? LMFAOOO
That guy in 1:06 looks familiar😉😄
How long does it take to make 1 video like wow
*big jump*     everyone was commenting about their editing being like a documentary and i was going to do that but it was overused so now pretend i said something funny
Cool
pyrocynical reference
Literaly how strong is this guys brain mentally
😂😂😂 9:25
Great … But can you jump 59,101 blocks???
gaming
I hate seeing YouTubers who put so much effort into their vids and only get like 10k views!!!!!
Another youtuber trying to beat the algorithm. If you ditch the text to speech voice it would improve the quality of your videos so much man. Take my advice
Idk who  the editor of this guy videos is but hes the best editor
if your wondering the max Gs he had is 1,364Gs
For the next video he's gonna beat minecraft without blocks
Wait. He Actually Just Jumped 59,100 Blocks High in Minecraft Survival. (No Mods)
My boy igblon wit da bangers
Here is a challenge. Get to 1mil before 2022
he dident realise that carpet farm/inf fuel and hoppers= afk smelt
Ghasts died becuz entity cramming
this guy makes the best videos ever to exist change your mind .
My guy literally gets 21st century humour that will make no sense in 100 years and combines it with documentaries and ✨magical✨ editing to make this catastrophic masterpiece      *and then proceeds to break minecraft*
Ghasts can't blow up cobblestone ;)
entity cramming g
Felt like I was having a conversation with the fun teacher that everyone liked while watching this video.

Ayo, what lvl of combat did you get by killing all those ghast?
Just discovered your channel with the void video perfect timing
“Hey, I can see my house from up here.”  I wanted to make a comment about how he combines modern humor with documentary-type content to make a beautiful conglomerate, but that’s overdone so instead I’m going to instead use an over-used trope with an over-used quote.
the first three comments I see refer to igblon as “this guy” _nice_
I disagree
