This was when Jorginho really joined Arsenal
Jorginho was always a gunner
Always been a Gunner
Jorginho was always a gunner
Who’s here after Arsenal win at the bridge again today?
Definitely deserves the Ballon D'or
Emile smith roweeee
Arteta Master Class. Give that man a contract and let him sign whatever numbers he wants too
Well done Arsenal, you won the 'We Beat Chelsea Twice' trophy
GreatGoal
1:15 penalty. VAR is garbage.
If we hadn't of scored surely the ref brings it back for a freekick in the box since Jorginho passed it back to kepa??
To whom it may concern **** you - Valteri Bottas F1 driver  Btw that’s us (Arsenal saying that to the stanky Chelsea weirdos)
I just wanted to say that even though arsenal have won two games in a row now it still does not make me happy
its not kepas fault
2:45 Jamie Carragher has spoken
Chelsea deserved that match, and I'm an arsenal fan
Leno was world class in this game you can’t lie
2:25 Mason mount was on the floor then sees the ball hitting the post and gets up LOL
Wait hold on why was the keeper not in the goal
Best league in the world right there
That safe right at the end was world class brilliant goalkeeping.
Well.. If they play against Man City, they might as well forget the cup
No highlights of Arsenal in possession...
love how as soon as we play with kepa we lose 😭
Leno is class.
daddy
Just a friendly message not related to this video ☺️ God loves you, no matter who you are, where you’re from or what you’ve done. He’s waiting with open arms for you to accept Him into your lives. Please repent of your sins and ask God for forgiveness. He loves and cares for you. Jesus has already paid the price for all of our sins, you just need to believe in Him that he’s our saviour and begin to live right with God. I love you and hope you have a lovely day. God Bless You☁️🙌
.... Xhaka backpass to Cech. Mustafi and Kolasinac complacent. Oh wait Arsenal Scored this once
Jorginho broke the golden rule, never back pass straight at the goal, always aim to one side.
1:00 the pass back was bad enough but that "shot" was embarassing. Are these supposed to be professional well paid footballers? Bloody hell....
I think it’s Kepas fault. His positioning was atrocious
Modern Football =Back Passin MUGS!!!
Jorginho forgot which side he was playing for 😂
Not blaming Kepa totally but can someone please tell me why Kepa was standing outside his goal post? Cos I don't understand football anymore.
Squeaky bottom time
Chelsea are going to regret this Liverpool top 4 now Leicester get a draw against Chelsea Then hopefully spurs don't bother against Leicester so they gift Leicester 3points Liverpool win all their games
To be fair Jorginho passed to where Kepa should have been, probably the best save I've seen from him though only to concede a few seconds later
When Kepa saved the pass from Jorginho, why doesn't the back pass rule apply? Or am i being thick? I thought goal keepers can't handle the ball from a back pass
How is kepa allowed to use his hands to save jorginhos pass when its clearly a passback?
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Arteta masterclass
People called martinelli’s goal overrated yet their player can’t even score it🤷‍♂️
Question: if Smith-Rowe does not score is that an indirect free kick for Arsenal as Mendy handled the pass back? Someone pls respond, having an argument with my brother
Arsenal are like that small club that raises their game for the big boys but lose to every other team
Arsenal 🤝 beating Chelsea when they don’t deserve it
People are actually gullible and believe these matches are legit and not bought
Chelsea got scammed
We need a striker!
not gonna lie but kepas shape in that smith rowe goal was a shambles but he pulled off  a gud save but want enough
These titles always mock Chelsea fans
2 little 2 late!!Keep Arteta stay mid table,simple!
Jorginho 😂😂
James Charles and bad boy went missing today
Don't know why the blame is seemingly solely on Jorginho. Yes it was a bad back pass but also blame Thiago Silva. He had no faith in his GK rescuing that situation and gave up. Aubameyang kept going when he didn't.
This was the most boring game of the season 🤣 as a mutual both team were awful.
I swear arsenal is always lucky in a way
Come on Leicester! 😅
I would like to have one of these genius managers to come on TV and explain to us all mortals what are the benefits v risks of this "playing from back" shite.
great save from kepa
England is red top 5 most successful clubs in England major 1 liverpool 48 2nd utd 45 3rd arsenal 31 4th chelsea 25 5th city 22. blue comeback to us when u have more trophies than all liverpool have more trophies alone than city n chelsea combined
Kepa be marking the ball boy tho
Penalty surely
ESR just keeps getting better man big gun up
Some Fifa gameplay here man
Jorginho's pass was bad, but he froze, and that was the fatal error.
Boys and girls ffsake is just chelsea, I am surprised they didn't end up in stretchers like last time we played them. 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
I’m disgusted people are blaming Arrizabalaga for that one. He was in the right position to receive the back pass. Jorginho’s pass was crap. What More do you want the keeper to do
Chelsea been watching arsenal defend. Also, Chelsea unlucky not to get a pen too
No one gonna mention that miss from havertz?
people saying about kepas save, what about holdings ...
Arsenal got so lucky ahah
To whoever's reading this,I hope you have a great day..I just uploaded and would love it if you checked it out and liked!💞
Abramovich spends millions on illegal Israeli settlements in Palestine. I hope Chelsea get humiliated in the Champions League Final.
Does that mean Arsenal are European Champions and thus best team in Europe by logic. Chelsea beat Man City and Arsenal beat Chelsea 🤔😂🤦‍♂️
Defence was world class this game well done to the gooners
Talk about ...park the bus...  gifted a goal on 16.. then sat on that one goal the whole game. No wonder arsenal are a bottom half of the table club now. How embarrassing.
Klopp, pep, ancelloti, mourinho    But Tuchel couldn’t beat arteta 😂😂
And apparently we want to sell Leno in the summer?? Well, I hope we've got someone at least as good lined up cos you could do a lot worse than him, that save at the end was class.
To be fair, Kepa did get to the pass back quickly as surprising as it was
That first goal just shows how little passion, vision, agression and mindset exists in that football club.
0:23 "That's a sitter". Since when was that a sitter?
Should that not have been an indirect freekick from Kepa handling the ball on a pass back rather than being allowed to continue? Or would you get the benefit of advantage?
Chelsea are a counter press attacking team .you have to score first against there 3-5-2 set up.
Would that not have been a penalty for arsenal anyway with kepa handling that back pass in the first place?
A season where we do the double over Chelski, and then realise that teams like Aston Villa, Everton and Wolves have all done the double over us!
Good win for mid table arsenal 👏
The only shot on target I've seen that guy make apart from penalties 🤷🏿‍♂️
Liverpool did the double over shitty arsenal
Sort your defence out Chelsea lol
Free kicks for backpasses handled by the goalkeeper are always a lot of fun and games but what would have happened here had Arsenal not scored. Its a handled back pass and free kick to them which would have had to be taken a foot from the goal line
Stop blaming Jorginho when Kepa made a horrendous judgement mistake.  You never leave your net empty, especially when things are happening near to your football square. Kepa is a muppet and he really has to go.
0:32 If Kepa didn't charge in on Auba and opened his eyes to see Silva signalling him to stay back & that he'd close him down instead, there's a solid chance the cut back to Rowe wouldn't have been made and even if it had, Kepa could've been alert to it. Kepa's positional awareness is such 💩
I blame kepa left the whole goal exposed
Typical Arsenal goal that! They actually tried their hardest to miss
Good news for Liverpool
WTF was the keeper doing all the way over there though??
Arsenal have won last 3 games out of 4, they could be in for a shot taking the premire league off City
Funny how Arsenal fans think they are anything other than tinpot. You did the double, nice. We got a FA cup and CL final coming up.... 👀
Arsenal fan here: Is no one going to mention Rob Holding handball to save the goal?
The back pass was awful and the save was great but what on earth was he doing so far off the line, he went from LB to keeper very quickly though to be fair
My best mates a Gooner and I said to him the way things have gone this season wouldn't shock me if Arsenal beat Chelski I know they had about 95 % of the ball but if you don't score Hey what's Tuchel got against Tammy Abraham I don't get it this game was screaming for him to come on I don't like the way he's being treated there's NO EXCUSE for it someone needs to have a word in The young Mr Burns lookalike ear hole not good Tammy was the top striker now he's been kicked in the nads with the euros coming up I was in favour of Chelski not now I hope they do an Avram Grant and finish runners up in euro Cup and Fa Cup and miss out on champs league place the man's a nasty don't like nasties lol
More Kepa's fault. Where the hell was he going?
How did Chelsea not win
Annoys me when small teams raise their games against bigger clubs
Kepa has zero luck pope guy
This is why Chelsea won't win CL 😂
If Chelsea win the UCL, does that make Arsenal the best team in Europe?
If Chelsea win the UCL, does that make Arsenal the best team in Europe?
I'm delighted with a win but honestly can any Arsenal fan explain to me why we couldn't do that on Thursday against Villa real, just needed one goal
Tuchel to be sacked by October now that the 'new manager bounce' has wore off
No handball no foul .. if its Liverpool or United that would be given easy
No ngolo no parry
Chelsea has no strikers that can shoot even tho they are class players
Bad loss for Chelsea. As they are the best side in London now miles ahead of any other London side.
Oh arsenal when they always dominated
2:38 that save 🤩🤩
Nobody is going to talk about Kepa handling a back pass????
Why didn't VAR point out that there was an offence before the goal, (and therefore that play should have be stopped before the goal) ie the goalkeeper handling a backpass. Surely the correct decision should have been an indirect free kick to Arsenal.
To be fair that was a back pass so the keeper wasn’t allowed to touch it with his hands.
Leno kept us in the game
to be fair to jorginho, what on earth was kepa doing so far out of his net? Jorginho plays that pass because thats where any sane keeper would be standing to hoof the ball away on a backpass or to cover if an Arsenal press came off. pass was fine the positioning was horrendous. even after he's made the save he then rushes out of his net again which gifts smith-rowe a tap in. shocking keeping. if he just sits in his net this dosent happen.
Na havertz should've scored we got very lucky
Arsenal and Chelsea trade place
Where was kepa off too
Should have been an indirect free kick from the pass back. Terrible refereeing...
Lol we got destroyed and still hung on defensively, somehow
Appalling decisions Chelsea should have had 2 penalties
100% we will lose to palace now just watch 🤣🤣🤣
Of course we beat Chelsea and double them when there is no pressure on. Why didnt we see any of this against Villarreal when it mattered?
oh for fu-
Why do the Arsenal players even celebrate at this stage of the season? Oh wait goal and assist bonuses 🤣
Shouldnt it have been a free kick for the keeper using his hands after a backpass?
First bit of luck arsenal have had all season
Why didn't Chelsea get a pen after it hit the defenders hand from Mount? Any handball is a pentalty now right?
Thank you Arsenal 😁 well done on your win 😁
Dear lord thank you for bernd Leno
Kepa was at fault for arsenal goal aswell  if kepa was standing between his goals he would have deal with that back pass
Leno is a well good keeper
Kepa sorry Crapper not exactly cementing a place in the Champion League final then lol
Kepa's best save this season and its against his own teammate xD
That was a fantastic header by zouma
How unlucky is Chelsea
This could end new manager bounce? In a real scrap for top 4 if West Ham can win their next game?
Ajay
Mount's miraculous recovery at 2:25
How is that not handball? you can't use your hands from a back pass
Chelsea played  how we all feel like when playing fifa
I'm a blues fan so not the usual one to praise Arsenal but Leno did well in net,  kept some decent shots out
Cant believe chelski have done it again, we smashed them when we was having the worst run of the season and we've done it again hahahhaah
2 stone wall penalties not given, shocking officiating
So many overrated players in both squads
Chelsea fans say martalleni is only relevant because the "easy sitter" when kante slipped....... havertz last night?
They finally won at Stamford Bridge for the first time in 10 years in 2021 ,
Arsenal first win at Stamford Bridge stadium since October 2011 , when it was 5-3 to them back then
Arsenal let goooo
that smith Rowe is a world class player, he makes Arsenal proud to have him.
How tf are chelsea gonna win cl if they cant beat arsenal
how are ucl finalists losing to arsenal...
Its not Jorginho's fault, its Kepa's fault. Why doesn't he stay in goal. Does he not know where the goal is? He's out of goal for the pass back and out of goal again for the goal.
Wtf is kepas positioning about there? Not defending the back pass at all but Kepa should have been way more central. Given the back pass was struck gently and he only just made it, had Chelsea been dispossessed and a shot come in quickly it was an open net. He was in no mans land where he was.
I swear arsenal could play David Luiz by himself and they'd still fluke a win against Chelsea
Arsenal’s press forced the mistake yet i’m seeing barely any comments crediting Arsenal for that
Ansenals like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get.
I am an arsenal supporter. I didn't expect this to happen
Well Done! ❤️❤️❤️Arsenal Forever
What was kepas Positioning people blame jorgenho but it was his positioning
Chelsea when against the top 4- 💪 Chelsea when agains arsenal- 💩
And there was us berating Rodri for his mistake.  Chelsea in for a shock come the final ;)
Every player makes mistake just when it happens it looks bad
i swear kepa can't use his hands from a backpass
Wtf was jorghino thinking.
Arsenal’s first double over Chelsea for 17 years. Not the kind of achievements we should be caring about. But I’ll take what we can get. (I also have £50k worth of Football Shirts ;)
Sorry, I may be wrong, isn’t that Jorginho pass a pass back?
Kepas as much to blame to look at his positioning. Hes not standing in goal or near the goal
What a win
Surely once kepa saves that backpass on the goal line it becomes an illegal backpass and should be an indirect free kick or is there some reason I don't know about why its not?
To be honest on this one Chelsea were better but should definetly have played better.
Always nice to beat Chelsea, consolation prize for poor Arsenal season.
1:16 as a arsenal fan. I’m still confused if that’s a hand ball or not
Only arsenal double over chelsea and beat them at stamford bridge in 10 years and beat man utd at old trafford in 15 years in thier worst season in 25 years
Chelsea let my acca down for £650, after watching these highlights I think I’m going to stop betting
🤬 i was looking forwards to AFTV  "very dissappointing today...."   Fuckkng Arsenal thwarting my plans!!
Jorginho = The Chelsea version of Xhaka? 😂
Why do arsenal always beat the small teams
Mistake by Jornginio
Jorginho is so bad, no idea why he is rated so much
To the people who thought that Chelsea would easily win lol 😂. I’m not a arsenal fan or Chelsea fan
Basic unwritten rule, you never put a pass back between the sticks.
Nise
I love how we are in ninth having one of our worst seasons and we still do the double over one of the champions league finalists and yet we can’t beat Burnley.
In all fairness kepa actually did really  well to stop jorginhos pass. It was just unlucky that arsenal ended up scoring a goal.
Arsenal are still shite they could go into the Scottish prem and still finish bottom they scored one lucky goal and now everyone's acting like they have just one the prem reality check your still mid table that will not change without aftv no one would watch Arsenal!
I think it was because of kepas positioning he weren’t in his goal
Havertz cant shoot and gorginho should get sold jesus
Chelsea got unlucky this time
Arsenal defeat Chelsea to ignite their charge on... Um... 8th place!!  😂😂🤣🤣😝😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
As someone who is both bi-polar, a Knicks fan and an Arsenal fan, I’m going insane.
Arsenal barely touched the ball
As a Chelsea fan who cares we have 2 finals to worry about not this defeat
The thing that made Jorginho's mistake worse was the fact that him and other defenders stood watching whilst Arsenal pounced, not sure how an handball wasn't given. So many times this season they've been given for less. Looking forward now to next season though and seeing fans back. This season has largely been poor for that factor alone, atmosphere and intensity created from that atmosphere will be great to see again.
If Arsenal hadn't scored from the back pass, would they have had a penalty for a deliberate handball by the goal keeper?
Lesssssss goooooo arsenal
Tbh i dont really care about this loss since city have won the league already and we also have 2 cup finals
I love the way VAR is more useless now than it was before, at the beginning of the season if the ball came off you arm/hand no matter what the circumstances, it was penalty. The last couple of PL games I’ve watched, there have been definite handballs and nothing given, why has it change. Teams earlier in the season have already lost points on this. VAR was crap to start with and it’s still crap now, it’s ruining football, get rid of it.
So one week we’re beating chelsea and Leicester and the other we are drawing to fulham and burnley. I love this club
Arteta giving hints to Pep
Can we plz have no hate? I’m an arsenal fan but Chelsea were good apart from the Jorginho pass, IMO I don’t think we deserved to win but I have to say our defense I’ve shape was ok
Blurry for anyone else?
If you watch Jorginho doesn't even rush back hard enough @ smith!! Bottom line Chelsea manager didn't give arsenal respect he messed about with the team !!
Feel bad for kepa lol should have been a clean sheet
I now celebrate 20 mins after we score just to make sure VAR ain't ruling it out, this shite needs to go
Arsenal fans are so stupid
These wins mean nothing. The pressure is off. Arteta still needs to go, along with a fair few players.
Stupid thing is if we had best Fulham and Everton we would be 3 points of champions league
How was that jorginho's fault , blame the keeper for being out of position
Imagine if smith rowe missed. He nearly did.
It's so frustrating cos our finishing really is awful. It just shows how badly we need a striker!
stop giving me stinky 20 second ads i cant even skip you dickheads
Havertz is just overrated
Unfortunately, the win is for them because they want to protect their contracts not for fans. Many of players knew Arteta goes they go too.
Terrible position for any goal keeper to have that ends up a sloppy goal…
Arteta and the owners still need to go, winning meaningless matches means nothing...
Chelsea players minds are on Fa cup final and  champion league 😄
Undeserved win
What was kapa doing way out of position when Jorginho passed back......Kapa wasn’t where he should have been.....it was the goal keepers fault on the blame culture.....
Can’t believe Chelsea lost they should be deducted points for fielding 11 players from within their 25 man squad. Outrageous
No AFTV tonight...  😢
This is why you don’t bet on football
Jorginho had a horrendous game against arsenal he looked half asleep the whole time from start to finish witch was abit odd
Why are people not moaning about the keepers positioning, does he think he's playing as a fullback....
Kepa is so badly out if position there.  Jorginho passed to where Kepa should have been. Yes it's still bad awareness on his part, but Kepa is just as much to blame, if not more so. Zouma is also at fault for putting Jorginho under pressure in the first place when he could easily have gone back to Kepa himself
This is the the team that couldn't score against Villareal.  Did they just not WANT to play in Europe next season?
Fine margins and all of that. Sometimes these things can carry over. Let’s see what happens.........
Chelsea had been missing Kepa for too long, so long that Jorginho had to remind people of who he was.
nice handball 1:15
Arsenal has their issues but screw Chelsea, you deserve the loss. My teams second.
I’m an Arsenal fan but looking back at the highlights Chelsea should have scored at least 3  just wasn’t there day that defensive mistake by Chelsea was dreadful and cost them big time also some amazing saves by Leno to keep Chelsea at bay the defence was allover the place and everything including the bar kept them out just wasn’t to be for Chelsea tonight but a wins a win so I’ll take that unlucky tho Chelsea
Bipolar is an understatement
Thank you arsenal with love from leicester
To little to late
Kepa with an absolutely save of his career and the commentary give him nothing!!
0:28 the most mediocre commentary ever
Arsenal is so bummy man
It was Arsenals night
Leno easily MOTM. Some really great saves to keep us ahead.
Smith Rowe's shot would have gone wide did it not hit his standing leg!
How did we win this game? So unlucky for Chelsea tonight
I’m so confused on why Jorginho is important for Chelsea. I question why not Kante and kovacic. Jorginho had some really good games this season and I finally realised his importance but when he does these kind of things( giving ball away at poorly) I actually start doubting the guy.
what's worse is after making the mistake jorginho is just ball watching following the pass if he has the initiative to run back he may have been able to stop the goal
Ziyech player so well when he came on. Almost made an immediate impact. When he will play with full confidence like that in whole game, he would be insane. But anyways FairPlay Arsenal, they kept their head down and had a tight defence
Very clever from tuchel, trying his best to keep arteta in the job so arsenal will be just as bad next season
Free Palestine
Leno again saving arsenal
They lost to arsenal at home and they think they can beat city 😂😂
Jorginho. Easily, pretty much undeniably, the worst central midfielder ever to play in the division. He either almost invisibly makes his way through a game doing absolutely nothing, misses a penalty, or does something even worse, as was seen this evening. Terrible player.
can arsenal fans actually be proud about that performance such a small club now😂
We own chealsea...
Is it funny that Arsenal that's had average season still manages to inflict tuchel first defeat as Chelsea manager? The future is bright indeed!!
how is offside in a corner kick?
back pass to keeper and keeper save it not a hand ball?
Jorginho’s howler was karma for last season when he should of been sent of but ended up getting the winner 😂👍
Kepas save was unbelievable for jorginhos mistake
Liverpool fan , thank you arsenal 🙌🙌🙌
1st london derby win that didn't change my mood what so ever
Three losses on the bounce against Arsenal 😂😂
If you go on some shitty channel called Chelsea Fan TV or something, they think Kepa is in fault here apparently poor positioning? 🤣 everyone go to their channel and dislike their video - Chelsea fan
And they said Jorginho is a pass master
Don’t get why people blaming Jorginho for the back pass it wasn’t amazing but kepas positioning was mad no reason for him to be where he was
Oh so they won coz of a mistake 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal being arsenal and parking the bus. Boring awful team
2:19 Ref turning into prime Tom Brady 👀
fair play to kepa he nearly saved chelsea
Anyone else think Kepa's positioning before the backpass was awful? And he was at fault too (despite the great save)?
If this were a game if FIFA, there would be a controller-shaped hole in my window
Ngl, kepa did brilliantly to get back to recover the back pass
Dominant performance from Arsenal, absolutely liquid football for the goal
What happened to the world beaters chelsea who said there going to win the champions league 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chelsea fucked my coupon, £5 for £2.7K 😪
Wasn’t even highlight worthy 😂
Top4 here we come!!!
Well done arsenal 😊
Man City please beat these frauds on the 29th
10th place arsenal just shut out champions league finalists Chelsea. Rode their luck but still good defensive performance, room for improvement though don't get me wrong we're dogshyte most weeks
How is Havertz missing one on one this consistently?
Varsenal
Just when people thought Leicester were bottling it. Everyone's coming to the rescue to help them secure it 😂
Chelsea fans saying Mount is the key to their season when he can't even defeat the worst arsenal side in 30 years. Kante is actually there most most important player
How did Saka unlock the new RB position ffs Arteta  🤣🤣🤣🤣
We got the double over Chelsea pahahahah jokemen
Arsenal fans: We beat Chelsea. Chelsea beat Man City Twice.... Arsenal > Man city... Man City champions... So... Arsenal best team in Premier League 😂😂😂
He only just scored... 😳
Thanks Jorginho you just could have left the door open a little but we have to get a result from Manchester Utd that’s if the game gets played
Havertz 🤝 Werner Missing 1 on 1 chances
Jorginho's actually been great this season, but jesus christ when he fucks up, he really fucks up...
Has Arteta changed his formation or something since the 6 months cup run. I'm confused surely keep it like you did with the Fa Cup swear he changed it
Last time Arsenal did the double in the League Chelsea won the UCL and FA Cup, laaaawd please dont let this happen again 🙏
After seeing these comments you wouldn't think that Chelsea absolutely dominated the game, only lost because of Jorginho being an absolute donut... who cares anyway, Chelsea are in the Champions league and FA Cup final, Arsenal are a mid table club at best...
Lucky Lucky Arsenal who caught Chelsea on a really bad day.
(arsenal fan)we have had one of the worst seasons as a 'big club' and have pulled both wins over Chelsea who are in the UCL final
It's pretty much a meaningless win for us, And i didn't think we deserved to win this game....
what was Kepa doing so far off his line?
Rather Timo or Havertz, they need 10 chances to score 1. I'm sorry but it's simply not good enough. How can they win UCL with these bunch of missers
What about the miss from havertz 1 on 1
People blaming Jorginho and Kepa know nothing about football. Arsenal did press them well but if you look closely Thiago sees Auba but doesn't follow him. Arsenal overall wanted it more. Chelsea needs to recruit new defenders this summer or miss out on a title challenge next season.
Arsenal in a nutshell: Be dogshit, beat Man United and Chelsea, go back to being to dogshit
Wenger out
Of course arsenal in terrible form beat a top team 1-0
Look to put it in perspective....foden has 8 trophies at 20 years of age and soon to be 9 on the 29th May.....the rest are shite....
A lucky escape
Arsenal won but don't be fooled by this result. Poor team will be lucky to finish mid table again next season.
TBH this changes nothing of how I feel about Arsenal I rather win a trophy this season than do the double vs Chelsea, there's still major rebuilding at hand.
Roles were switched this game - Arsenal being defensively dominant and Chelsea conceding via a howler and as a Chelsea fan there’s nothing an Arsenal fan can say that will trigger me. Nonetheless, gg.
When Arsenal's name pop up you respek it
Chelsea doing a Arsenal
If only Gary was there for that back
I mean, unlucky for Chelsea, Arsenal paying off goal posts to win games. You hate to see it
🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
still sticking with my initial prediction - the current top 3 will end the season in the same positions.
London is red
ngl why was Kepa so far to the left of his goal? looked like he forgot where his net was
I'm an Arsenal fan but can someone explain how Havertz has messed that opportunity twice in the same fashion too. Guys an absolute flop, Werner gets all the flack but he's ten times the player Kai is
Be amazed how arsenal won this game
Jorginho`s excessive back passes finally pays off
There you go Liverpool, you still have a chance now, just beat Man Utd
Chelsea should have had 2 penalties. Arsenal just got lucky
Arsenal with no team personality, won by luck. Game was like watching relegation zone team Vs top of table team. Luck was in Arsenal's side.
So I guess liverpool still have a chance for top 4
You can’t keep blaming arteta tbh. Arsenal can win games just most the time they don’t turn up
London’s red
BanterFC back at again 😂 pure comedy
Guys...why is that not a penalty? Isn’t that a back pass? And keeper uses his hands ?
Wtf are VAR watching, Chelsea should’ve had 2 clear penalties
Keeping top 4 race open. Thanks Arsenal.
The fact arsenals best achievement this season is doing the double over Chelsea shows how far they’ve dropped
This goal is incredible. Look at the reaction of Jorginho after the made the pass, and Arsenal's nr 11. Comedy😂  Also I think Kepa is poor here, immediately after stopping his teammate's pass from going in, he  should stay on goal and not commit UNLESS he's sure to get the ball
1:16 Uhm... Isn't that Handball? Like... That's his hand, and it's sorta poking outwards...
Kepa did pretty well tbf on that one😂
It's time people put some respect on Timo Werner!!!! Being out of the side showed
VAR was 😴😴 penalties not given to Chelsea! fouls inside the box and handball well done referees 👏👏
So they beat City 2-1 and can't even draw against Arsenal...          *MY BRAIN CELLS*
If mourinho did wat arteta does he would be slammed
If Arsenal wants to progress, they need to sign Bissouma. Him and Partey in the middle will build Arsenal. Someone who is not afraid of putting in a tackle.
I only hope for Chelsea to miss out of top four and lose the ucl final so that we don’t have to watch this disgrace of a team play in champions league and occupy a spot for a more worthy team.
This team can do the double over the UCL finalists but can't score one past Villarreal smh
So no one gonna talk about the hand ball in the box var didn’t even check it ref looking right at it lol wot a joke
Jorginho what on earth was he doing?
It’s like Giroud left Arsenal for the better
Arsenal fan good luck in keeping spurs out the champions league hope Chelsea win all the last games.
Funny how VAR goes our way when there's nothing to play for lol
Well they done the double over Chelsea this season 3-1 at home now this away. Plus beat them in fa cup final past season. They like Chelsea this season. They would be decent if they could beat mid table teams as they beat spurs at home man United away and drew with United at home. Decent results against the top 6 and relegation teams. just struggle with mid table. Pep said that Arteta will become a great manager so they might be one to watch next season if they make a couple strong signings to score more and tighten midfield there defence is one of the better in the league. we will see.
Here's something for Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs fans to agree on. We are all shiy
Surely the keepers positioning was questionable prior to the back pass ?? Only seen the highlights so maybe There’s a reason he was nowhere near the goal?
Arteta: Jorginho have a tenner! Jorginho: No problem mate.
I hate how they have the highlights sped up
So unlucky
Apparently we have a chance of getting some kind of European football
Jorgiho is out here cost us games and we only talking about selling Tammy 😒
Arteta: Jorginho you'll be a great signing for Arsenal! Jorginho: Hold my beer mate!
If Chelsea wins the CL, technically speaking Arsenal is the best team in Europe!
Bernd leno =neuer
nah bmt how tf is my man back passing some stupid guy
Well top 4 just opened back up
I swear Chelsea are the like a big brother to Arsenal, always gifts points like a good big brother!
To be fair kepa should of been closer to the goal
Chelsea just gave us points. No conviction from arsenal performance in my opinion.
havertz and werner its time to go
Defensively very good from Arsenal. Chelsea struggled to create clear cut chances, especially 2nd half.
As a Chelsea fan, I didn't watch it because I was working, but how the f did Arsenal get away with another win again against Chelsea?. From this highlight, it looks like they didn't create anything apart from that Jorginho gift to them.  Unlucky few matches against them. We have had NO LUCK  in the last three or four matches against them. It just doesn't happen for us.
No way. I thought the media and most Chelsea fans said Chelsea are unbeatable.
If havertz was Sterling that is a pen,
Ah would ya stop giving liverpool fans hope they have been through enough this season ffs🤣🤣🤣 United will put out their first team tomorrow to finish all hope.
Kepa makes the best save of his life only to see the ball in the back of the net 3 seconds later
Shouldn't kepas save been a handball anyway since it was pass back?
No one gonna talk about how arsenal defender stuck out his hand to block mounts volley ?
Chelsea thinks they are easy but you got your hat trick defeat
Fans somehow manage to blame this on kepa..
Havertz missing sitters as always, nice
We did lose but we played much better just we couldn't find the net sad day😭
Been saying this for months arsenal isnt a possesion team like arteta wants them to be they're counter attack  they defend deep very well and they are good on the trasition
We never ever look convincing even in our wins.
I thought kepa was playing gk not Lb
From all teams, Arsenal keep a clean sheet😭
As soon as the pressure is off, Arsenal start producing.
Chelsea doing their best arsenal impression
Fantastic win today be it too little too late in the season!
Arsenal always win when is not important. .......
Well done Arsenal. Not a fan but u needed that.
Arsenal were extremely lucky. From the double bar, playing a weakened chelsea team with tight fixtures, given a goal which they almost missed with a terrible shot. Created very little
Chelsea beat Manchester City and we beat Chelsea so basically means we won the champions league 😏😏😏😏
FIFA didn't want Chelsea to score.
I can predict Arsenal will lose to Crystal palace next Wednesday this is why you can't trust them 😂😂
The worst thing about that goal was jorginho just stood and watched after his mistake. if he had run back immediately he could've intercepted...
Why do we play Jorginho 😔 also should of had a pen, terrible result but we need to learn to put our chances away...
Lol early on the defence for both teams...
Poor finishing and a terrible goal to concede. Arsenal didn't win the game, Chelsea lost it
Havertz showing his true colours missing an absolute sitter. God knows what tuchel sees in him
You would have thought after Rudiger's own goal it was drilled that YOU NEVER PASS BACK TO THE NET ALWAYS TO THE SIDE!
Gives Liverpool a better chance and west han
Should have been an indirect freekick for the handling of a backpass.
That’s Leno back at his best
Jorginho main error was standing like a statue after it.
If Smith Rowe didn't score ?, would that be a penalty since it was a pass back ?
Commentator sounds like he's seen it all..pretty boring.
Havertz one of the flops of the season
No Werner no party
Safe to say he won’t be starting in the UCL final 😅
1:15 literally saves it with his hand and not even checked but ok👍🏻
Have a read of Luke 6:45
😭
So chelsea beat real madrid and city but lose to relegation candidates. I mean arsenal didnt deserve to win but they did.
I bet Tuchel's taken a call tonight from Roman. 'One game to prove yourself or you're out'.
One word “luck”
Arsenal doing the double over chelsea. This season is weird af.
Can someone with a good ball knowledge tell me what Jorginho brings to the team??? Apart from the odd side pass
How is that not Kepa’s fault
Giroud played as our 12th man tonight NA NA NA NA NA NA, NA NA NA GGGIIIRRROOUUDDD 😂🤣
literally just not chelsea's day
Jorginhos error yet no one will talk about kepas positioning for the mistake
Coys🙄
1:14 how was that not handball honestly VAR GET OUT
Imagine not getting points from us hahahahaha thanks Chelsea for the 6 points
I thought after the loss, I’d be able to accept it. I’ve been feeling bad for Arsenal fans as of late, but the way they’ve reacted to this win shows how far they’ve fallen. “Biggest team in London”? Haven’t won the league since the invincible season and Chelsea have won 5 times. Chelsea have reached the champions league final 3 times(winning one so far), Arsenal only once. I’ll admit your history is much more significant than ours but the tides turned in 04. Treat these games against London clubs like your champions league finals cuz they’re the most significant games you will ever play
Martinelli’s goal ain’t easy after all
I feel sorry for kepa he doesn’t deserve it
You know what Chelsea we are in the Final we are in the Final
VAR straight up did not want Chelsea to win tonight lol
Ok this keeps it interesting... for another day at least. ynwa
Is that not a backpass by Jorginho and handball by Kepa? Has the ref just played the advantage? Can someone please explain? 😂
Wait... That Arsenal goal, if they had not scored, they were supposed to be awarded an indirect free kick on the goal line
If arsenal finish above spurs this season, it will be, hands down, the most embarrassing moment is spurs’ history.
Is it just me that’s seeing at 1:17 Chelsea should have had a penalty for a handball by holding?
Winning away at man utd and chelsea in the same season. Wow.
Arteta woke up today and chose to park the plane
Whys no one praising that save from kepa. I've never seen Leno do that.
Arteta "pass to jorginho on my mother's life he's playing for us"
London is claret or whatever tf West Ham play in
Sorry but what is Kepa doing there. Jorginho is passing to where Kepa should be on the goal line. He’s gone wandering off to the edge of the area 🙈
As a chelsea fan this was one of the most frustrating games I’ve watched in a long long time. Every cross was blocked, with 3 corners after the 80th min mark, Mount didn’t clear the first defender, and Hudson-Odoi was absolutely awful. Also why was Mount playing as a defensive midfielder
ESR is generational 🔴⚪️
Chelsea fans, dont be disappointed I almost had a heart attack every game we play including this one and played well. Ignore Aftv TY, Respect to all of u
The future of arsenal scores again. What a player 🔵⚪🔵⚪
The first word in the title that I saw was 'horrendous', I immediately thought it would be Arsenal! great win
Leno hands down is Arsenal's player of the season! Without him we would have gotten relegated in such a diabolical season.
3 times on the trot. Ahhhhhh just let that sink in Chelsea fans!!
Fun fact : Chelsea did a double over Arsenal in their worst ever season as well
That was a great save by Kepa
Really good save by holding there, should probably be picked ahead of pickford in the euros
Is that not a back pass to Kepa? Shouldn’t that be a red for handball stopping a goal?
If Werner missed the chance Harvetz missed he would have been crucified by now
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧨⚽️🍾🥂🍸
A moment of silence for those that put money on Chelsea 🤣🤣🤣
Seems like oil can't buy you class, outclassed these pricks for the third time in a row 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the first half performance by jorginho was one of the worst i have ever seen by a professional footballer
Chelsea loosinng to Arsenal again 😤 is it possible that Chelsea is doing this in purpose of loosing to Arsenal today ?? 😡 It looks strange to me something I don't believe never gone believe this result 😏  Shame 👈😡
Yo what a save from keep tho
Kepa is the type of person to invite you to his house in today but forget to tell you he's on holiday and won't be back for a week. Poor Jorginho lol
I swear all our players are offside all the time.
I can't believe Chelsea lost this game due to a mistake goal ffs, if Havertz scored his chance it would've been a different game
Appalled by the var chelsea should’ve had at least a pen today
Talk about papering over the cracks......Arteta 5 year contract extension incoming
Yes Arsenal 💯💯💯💯🇬🇧
One of these games where nothing goes your way is gonna happen, arsenal didn’t do much and took the gift that came their way but we move on, cup finals to play now
Thanks arsenal, from a leicester fan, 💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😁🇬🇧
Ooooo that Havertz claim is potential. We’ve seen softer pens given.
Jesus is coming soon He loves u and died for u pls turn to Him
Lol Tuchel meant to be infallible but loses to Arsenal.....Arsenal the banter team!! 😂😂
Don't worry, you guys are still gonna win the UCL 💯❤️
Another kepa mistake hes trash
Only club able to beat Chelsea and lose to Burnley
1:14 Chelsea should have had a penalty there. Unbelievable. There is no consistency with penalty decisions. Clear handball.
Swear we helping them out to push for Europe or something Haha, how have we lost that game 🤦‍♂️ 😂. But FairPlay to them  got a lucky goal and stayed defensive and well organised and Chelsea didn’t take our chances. Can only blame ourselves really 👏 👏
Why was Kepa so far out of his goal before Arsenal scored?
It honestly breaks my heart watching Giroud play for another team that’s not Arsenal
Glad arsenal won
Kante misses a game chelsea fall apart
Guarantee that last Double crossbar hit highlight will be played by sky sports in their ads sometime in the future
Are these German players doing this on purpose ? It's like they have made a bet on who can get most close  to the goal without scoring. I guess Haverts is still winning that bet.
If smith rowe doesnt press jorginho so aggressively.. he doesnt make that mistake.
Chelsea finishing is becoming a real joke and needs to be addressed. More shots on target at our own net than the opponents.
No Kante = Trash midfield
Bruh that's not fair on Kepa man, he didn't deserve that
Are we not gonna talk about that header from Zouma?
That was actually a world class save from Kepa to deny Jorginho
Bit late Arsenal.....you should have been doing that last week against Villareal....not now.
Terrible Jorginho back pass Edu: "hmmmm something about him, might have to sign him....."
Even Atheltico couldn’t of defended like we did today! COYG!!!
Chelsea did a arsenal
I’m not even surprised they parked the bus after scoring that lucky goal
London is red 👍👌👍👌
Keeps save tho
Italian xavi
I'll take it
Sky sports please give your pundits calculators so they stop making themselves and the channel look bad thanks
As a Chelsea fan I’m so jealous of arsenal I wish we were 8th and got knocked out of Europea league but at least they did the double over Chelsea
Chelsea managed to pull off an Arsenal with that defensive display 😂
Chelsea really just saving their best performances for later in the month .....when they'll be necessary. We're doing Arsenal a favour here by giving them an opportunity (undeserved imo) of European football next season. The harsh reality is that this Arsenal side aren't really good enough even for the Europa League. Thoroughly average and the worst Arsenal side since the early 1980's.
Good Ebening this was a very important victory for my former team 😂
It was mostly zouma and kepa’s fault imo. Zouma should’ve passed it to chilwell who was free at that time, but instead of that he passed it back to Jorginho who was being crowded by arsenal players. And that kepa, just what the hell was in his mind that he went that far to the left when we were playing so close to the goal? Smh.
Let’s be real, arsenal have mugged Chelsea off in recent history
Chelsea playing like that under Tuchel reminds me off Chelsea under Lampard TRASH
So much must have been going through Jorginhos mind
Well done boyz. We’re hanging in there for too long but a win is a win. Honestly thought Giroud would score...still rate him.
Arsenal played a horrible game, worst I've seen in years, also a gifted goal by Jorginho and all of sudden Arteta in..AFTV will be dead tonight
I have never been less bothered losing to arsenal feels weird
Lots of very salty Chelsea fans in this comment section
Chelsea this season - Winners Carabo Cup, CL Finalists, FA Cup finalists. Sitting in 4th  Arsenal this season - Sitting in 8tu place (Until Everton play then will drop to 9th) Not playing in Europe next season for the first time since 1995, Leno has said he wants to move this summer, Bellerin wants to leave.  You see the difference 😂😂  I get it Arsenal fans aren't use to celebrating real things like reaching CL finals so you celebrate a PL double as if it's the same 😂😂😂😂😂
Fair play to Chelsea, but could some1 tell me how we have somehow beat them twice in our worst season in history. 🤔
Who is the only team in London with a European Cup ???
No man can score a contortionists goal better than our former man Giroud - forever in our hearts
Shame Arsenal couldn't perform like this when it mattered.
WE LOVE YOU ARSENAL! WE DO!
Real football fans know that goal was Kepa's fault. His positioning was awful.
*I will never understand araena*
Havertz doesn’t miss that sitter then the game goes a completely different way. Chelsea have been wasteful even when they’ve won games and today it caught up with them. Embarrassing really
Smith-Rowe could pass as a Brazilian international. The kid oozes class
The cross bar saves Arsenal twice 🤪
Great to see Martin Tyler giving his best Jamie Carragher impression... 2:54
Jorginho, he's terrible how the hell does he stay in the Chelsea side and Italy International. He not good enough for championship.
Just when is Tuchel going to learn already, that playing Zouma and Kepa would almost guarantee our lose?
Chelsea fans cry about Arsenal parking the bus tonight as if they didn't win 3 league titles under a manager who does exactly that. The irony is incredible.
The title is unfair to Jorginho that’s kepas fault he’s moving like a goalie in fifa
0:27 Is this a backpass, and hence should the goal have stood because the goalkeeper committed a foul? Did the ref play advantage or what's the story
Arsenal were simply lucky, and I say that as an Arsenal supporter.  Chelsea clearly have one eye on Saturday's FA Cup and therefore did not field a more stronger side.
Lots of excuses tonight from Chelsea fans, worst arsenal team in a couple of decades do the double over them, any wonder they salty. London is red.
With all the rule changes lately I’m not sure what the decision would have been for the handled back pass ? It always used to be an indirect free kick from where the ball was handled , imagine that ! It was on the line
If we win tomorrow night maybe 4 place isn't over yet 🤔
arsenal is a depressed club.. let them have this one.
When Werner and Havertz learn how to finish Chelsea will be ruthless.
Please chelsea just win the fa cup and all will be forgiven. Well done arsenal for the win 🤝. Even though Jorginho had a howler today.
Arsenal fighting spirit has given hope to West ham to reach the champion league and revitalise Moyes ability to get a team into the Champion league with West Ham. Arsenal still has a chance to get into Europe this September and Rob holding a strong chance to play for England.
Parking the bus I see Mikel Arteta getting ideas from Mourinho
Arsenal are actually class, but you'll never hear anyone say it because they're not a top six club
Pathetic Chelsea. get it together 2-1 city 3-1 madrid lose to arsenal who are doing bad
Liverpool fan here: Thank you Arsenal for keeping our dream alive for just a little longer 🙏
Good game ❤️
Kepa did well to stop the backpass going in
I love the no look back pass.
Just waiting for the sky sports pundits to say Arteta is the best manager ever now...
Ahah arsenal played like a true 9th place team today park the bus after one goal😂😂
Havertz is finished sell him in June/july keep timo for another szn
It was a lucky win for us. That first chance for Chelsea was appalling from our defence
My guyyyyyy smithhhh
Chelsea were robbed, havertz miss, the fluke goal from Arsenal, the penalty not given, VAR helping Arsenal by ruling out the Chelsea goal, 2 shots off the bar. Premier league robbed Chelsea of a deserved win. Arsenal lucky to have won, good luck getting 8th
Arsenal this season in emoji 😁😎😲🙄😒🤬🤔 Aš a gooner i Just dont know what to say or think anymore
Double over Chelsea, Thank you😍
I cant seem to predict what Arsenals results are to be anymore lol.
Angry Rantman's neighbours are going to  have a hard time sleeping tonight
Glad we beat this disgusting club whose owner is funding building illegal settlements on the land of Palestinians. DISGUSTING CLUB and digusting fans. They were all rioting over ESL but I dont see any protests when Palestinians are being murdered in cold blood on what is their equivalent of xmas day. This is what the world has come to that they seem to care more about some football super league than the death of innocent human beings.
Kepa did well to keep that Jorginho shot out
Arsenal sneaking results in dead rubbers
City are shitting them self for the final 🤣
I guess VAR just not working today ?
Not kepas fault, was a good save actually but could’ve been a back pass lmao
Chelsea are in two cup finals while Arsenal are fighting relegation.
Someone tell arsenal they're allowed to attack
Arsenal GREAT when there's no pressure 😂😂😂
Just one of them nights, cant do much about it when youre up against luck itself lol. Any who on to the next game. Personally im not too fussed about this loss. More experience for the young lads to deal with a relentless tenacity arsenal showed. GG
Loooool worst season ever and we do the double over  chelsea
Arsenal getting their best result of the season now that they have nothing at all to play for. The Arteta way.
Would have loved the referee to volley that ball back to the Arsenal GK
Chlesky fans should consider and talk about their new manager ,coz sooner or later this one gets sacked as well ! a friend of mine said that " Chelsea FC manager vacancy " is on the job centres job lists ! anyone could apply for it .
Where all the  chelsea fans at I got some chips just need some of your salt 🙃🤫
Chelsea play boring football
Havertz is soo good
Truly shocking goalkeeping by Kepa again. Why is he out wide of the goal in the first place let alone the defender assuming the keeper is in goal on the pass back. All will point to the defender but honestly its the keeper. The worst keeper Chelsea have had for years, that would not have happened with mendy. Kepa is costing Chelsea dearly again
Its strange that we let a goal in and it wasn't kepa's fault
Liverpool now can get champions league if they win all their games because Leicester and Chelsea have to play each other. What a turn around if that happens
COYG
That's the sort of goal Arsenal usually concede rather than score :/
One of the biggest shocks all season
Chelsea won against sevilla, atletico madrid and real madrid but lose to west brom and arsenal
To make it worse Jorginho just ball watched after his pass whereas Smith-Rowe kept moving towards the ball which ultimately gave him the space to score
Very very bad Chelsea’s
Are ANY arsenal fans actually proud of their performance?? From the 30th to 96 th minute they kept a 10 man defence.  The most pathetic performance I’ve EVER seen.
It wasn't jorginios fault what was kepa doing he wasn't even in the goal 😂
Good goalkeeping by Rob holding. How was that not a penalty
Pep couldnt do it in 2 games and his former assistant did it. Lets see if Pep can do it in the finals.
Chelsea are the worst club in London 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
We are the masters of winning when it is completely pointless! 🔴⚪️😪
Chelsea have opened the door for Liverpool.
Does that mean we basically won the champions league?
*Something tells me this loss is a sign of a fa cup and ucl win*
Tonight only one person won - the bookmakers.
Kepa actually did quite well to keep it out in the first place
Giroud missed that chance on purpose, he wanted to give arsenal something to smile about, thats how sad it is at the moment for us 😉
Shocking arsenal were.3 points but wtf was that.non league everyone back.shameful lerformance.awful defending to give that many chances.get rid of arteta dont let him claw on with that dross no attacking performance.embarassing.aarsenal had ine attack snd arteta will make out undercontrol.should been 4 -2 chelsea but wow that was embarassing .on par with 05? facup final v man u who battered arsenal 120 mins snd lost on pens.get arteta out.defending was awful just got lucky.
ALAW MOT ⚪️🔵🟡
Arsenal could still qualify for the new UEFA  Europa Conference league 😀
Not that that was kepas fault but that mistakes because of the default connection between jorgi and Mendy
Too little too late
Can’t lie, Chelsea put on a decent show. Luck was not on their side I guess
Arsenal are still shocking these days,
Next thing we will hear is Arsenal fans saying they beat this year's champions League winners 🙄
Jorginho is a pound-land fabregas
Arsenal the invincible: Double over Chelsea Arsenal at their worst: Double over Chelsea
Liverpool 4th Arsenal 7th Both Merseyside and London are RED!!! ❤️❤️
tbf i know it was shite from jorginho but zouma dropped him in it and should have probably just gave it back to the keeper himself
Lucky arsenal
Last time Arsenal won at Stamford Bridge, Arteta was playing for them and now he goes and does the double over them in their worst season ever after beating them in a cup final.
Can’t wait to see them clash in Europe next season!!!
Kepa and Jorginhos fault. Kepa can’t position for his life.
Arsenal giving an unexpected Eid Gift
Arsenal fans celebrating 8th only to get sent back to 9th by Everton. Is this what Arsenal have become? No point watching the games 🤣
Havertz got the balance and composure of a giraffe with vertigo
Arteta out.
That was so boring. My eyes hurt
Chelsea should have won. The Game was in Arsenal’s favour.
Honestly as an arsenal fan. We weren’t good, we were lucky and we didn’t deserve a win. That’s just my opinion...
This just made the top four race a whole lot more interesting
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸  🇵🇸   Please remember those who are suffering in your prayers.
Bruh this has to be one of the most disgusting wins I've seen from Arsenal, and yet there are idiots who say "Arteta masterclass". That's why this club is in the situation they're in, they've embraced mediocrity.
Useless when they can’t just sit back and defend/counter
2:20 what a throw by the ref
Facts or undeniable facts?...it's a disappointing loss especially before a cup final but maybe this proof that when you find a formula that is winning. Don’t tinker like you're Raineri. But at the same time sacrifices have to be made for the main objective. The final is a few days away and some players were rested.
arsenal for the conference league
This is the real definition of not our night
Eid mubarak
Leeds United will finish above Arsenal this season
How was that not a pen
Chelsea will win nothing playing like that!  Can't finish the most simplest of chances.. terrible.
Chelsea engineering Arsenal into the Conference League next season. Genius.
Typical arsenal only performing when there’s nothing to play for 💩💩💩
Arsenal were lucky today
Maybe Chelsea do need Werner after all...
London is red bitches 🔴🔴🔴
Arsenals formation - 5 defenders - 4 CDMS - 1CM u call this football 😂 disgrace from arsenal
Absolutely shocking performance, these man up top couldn't finish their dinner and are as stiff as statues in madam tussauds. However jorginho's performance tonight was suicidal, that was possibly one of the worst passes I have ever seen and how the bloody hell did he miss touch that final ball, we were also way too slow and predictable in moving the ball, leicester will spank us if we play like this.
Funny how we play good against the london clubs to try and show london is red when we  play crap against other teams
I think Arsenal results should just be determined by a raffle or drawing lots because you really just don't know. Will save everyone time
pre the salty chelsea fans. respect it. shite arsenal team but put in a decent defensive performance
COYG 🔴⚪🔴⚪🔴
I understand Chelsea rotated but how do you go from beating city to losing to Arsenal
🤦🏻‍♂️ Kai havertz needs to stay out of the team  untill he actually cares! Walks around an blazes over the bar like he’s in the local park with his mates!
Make sure you subscribe with notifications on so you don't miss any of our Premier League uploads ► http://bit.ly/SSFootballSub 👍
c'mon you GUNNERS
ESR is levels
Trevor Sinclair says United are disrespecting the other teams competing for top 4, seems to me they are all making it as hard as possible for themselves!!
I thought north london was white but now it is 100% red
I never thought I'd see VAR work in Arsenal's favour
Why did Lampard buy chilwell? WHAT EXACTLY DOES HE OFFER?
Without kante n tino Chelsea got the creativity of a calculator
Arsenal touched the ball in Chelsea half once in this video 😂
paper over the cracks, if any arsenal fan is impressed they this single performance of a overall, shambles of season we might as well support millwall.
Wenger purposely sold giroud arsenal and made the fans hate him so he would get the sack knowing that for arsenal fans was would  regret it and he knew that 3 years down the line arteta and would beat Chelsea because jorginhio was distracted by Girouds good looks.  It’s an arsene Wenger masterclass
Smith Rowe is a better footballer than havertz
Disappointing night for both teams absolutely pointless win 😂
Jorginho must have been distracted by today’s news saying he’s been linked with in a swap deal for Barcelona’s pjanic
But Chelsea are Unbeatable 😂🤦‍♂️
This has to be the worst Arsenal team ever.
no kante
This game showed that Werner is instrumental to Chelsea. He was outstanding vs real Madrid
Leno deserves motm made so many key saves so under rated
That’s possibly the luckiest game I’ve seen arsenal play. I did not enjoy that as a gooner!
Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor
0:10 how?
How do you beat city but lose against arsenal
Good save from the back pass by Kepa
Conspiracy theory all big six trying help each other out  i wudnt put it past em look at juventus match fixing it's all possible specially in this covid crap era
This game has given Pep some ideas
120th!
chelsea getting robbed hear from a united pov
Unlucky Jorginho
It does speak volumes when Arsenal beat the team who beat the champions twice............ Arsenal are the real UCL winners..........
Jorginho providing his CV to Arsenal for the summer transfer
Liverpool and West Ham’s  players and fans will be happy with this result
Chelsea with all the foreplay,they just couldn't stick it in
Smith rowe best English player
First of all Arsenal got gifted a goal secondly Chelsea can not play against they own crap tactics and if u think Chelsea will beat city u r deluded
I feel bad for those people who bet all their money on Chelsea beating Arsenal
Football is dead.. well done Richard masters 👏
What if Chelsea lose the FA Cup,  champions league finals and miss out on top 4 finish??!!
FUT champs be like
We caused our own downfall tonight, however, tuchel got it wrong I feel. Took gilmour off and didn't give arsenal enough respect. When we put Giroud on chelsea barely crossed into the box and this puts us into more pressure ahead of the final and our last two premier leagues to get top 4. However, arsenal defensively were very good and feel they deserved it, we didn't do enough. Those two potential penalties I feel like we should have made a bigger deal of as we have seen them given, however, arsenal defended very well so I don't feel we can really complain
Chelsea must have been sooo upset hitting 2 crossbars in a row 😂
Well done Arsenal. Solid defence. We Chelsea should have done more.
Lovely
Cant be the only one thinking we were missing  Timo Werner today Arsenal playing their dull game of having 11 men defending at the back after getting a lucky goal, cant wait to see Arsenal fans comparing him to SAF after this lucky win for them
Despite arsenals season they will still be trynna say London is red
Just want to say - Chelsea are Robinhood Club
Last time Chelsea lost to Arsenal at Stamford Bridge (2012), we won the Champions League Let that sink in....
Am I the only one who noticed the back pass in real time
Havertz is so deceptive, it takes him a bit of revving up but he's quick when he gets going!
Made my bad day worse
Looool Mason Mount 🔭 Smith Rowe is clear.
Can I just point out Jorginho's performance tonight? Absolutely outstanding for us. From his role in our goal and his clearance at the end of the game. Man of the match for me.
I literally am so uninterested in us at the moment. Shite performance complete luck
Haha chelsea
Beat Liverpool, Atletico, Real Madrid, City x2, and lose to relegation candidates. We are Chelsea 🔵🙌
Pascal Cygan
I don’t understand how we beat Real Madrid and city and then bottle it to arsenal
Arsenal fans still in no position for verbal
Jorginho with his best KDB impression
We dominate possesion but we cant score
After suffering a lot this season, Arsenal finds a way to beat Chelsea again. Supporting this club is like having a bipolar disorder.
to be fair to arsenal they stayed very defensively resolute, didn't think they had it in them to stay in the game (chelsea fan pov)
How that isn’t a pen I will never know😂
Seen havertz has been practicing his finishing
Smith Rowe showing mount how it’s done
Most exciting European spots finish ever - still hoping Leicester and West Ham will do it
Those last 50 minutes were squeaky bum time
As much as we banter arsenal, they tend to turn up when the odds are stacked up against them.
Chelsea played their B team and thats completly the right thing to do against a small team like Arsenal(chelsea completly MOLESTED arsanal but i guess the luck was on the small teams side)
What a save from kepa though!!
Bruh
Smith Rowe is great and he stepped up today both defensively and attacking
Hahaha they lost against arsenal and they think they have a chance against man city
At this point arsenal could go from beating prime barca to losing to San Marino’s under 10s within a week
FIRST!
Great back pass 🤣
Can’t be the only one that felt like we were gonna lose for some reason today
Thank for the favour up to us now to win tomorrow
Arsenal's defence was actually good tonight
Arsenal are consistent at being inconsistent fr
Surely we should be playing CL final?
Jorginho is mad why that stupid pass
Feel sorry for kepa at this point
Mikel arteta masterclass so happy he’s our manager one of the best in the league. Give him more time and we’ll go places COYG what a win
Let’s not get carried away with Chelsea. They may well have been out of the champions league in the quarter finals if they were on the other side of the tournament tree.
Lol imagine losing to us
Chelsea will not win against Leicester 🤣 if they are  loosing to arsenal
COYG
Chelsea fans now gonna claim they didn’t care coz they’re salty bout this one
We have a chance cmon Liverpool
I just want to say this : emile Smith rowe is an amazing talent
3 wins in a row against Chelsea and a league double over them since 2004 let’s go
First lol
George Graham would be proud of arsenal's defence tonight
