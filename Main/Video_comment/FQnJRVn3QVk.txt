Never noticed until now that the first trailer has two actors who’s in the Scream tv series
Does Dylan know the pituitary gland is not in your penis right 7:04
were it all started...
Is this the first "guess the review score video"!!! and I found it without even looking for it?
That sweater is pretty sanitary bro
Lmfao Gal Gadot in a movie should tell you right off the bat it’s gonna be a horrible score
Dylan did the "im just a chill guy" meme first
7:02 Your pituitary gland is not in your penis😅
the trailers he watched were for like 2014-2018 movies, weren't millenials teens back then? People keep saying your not a teen anymore. Of course bro 😂. But those movies were for teens way back when... Right? 😅
Work it did have a tomato meter it was 85%
"DO NOT recommend movie trailers this is not what this is about" Now its a full blown series on your second channel where you have to scroll down a huge pdf file of peoples suggestions 😂
Mammogram scene being the most watched part of the video by far makes this a dark day.
"Throat punch, vagina chop" 😂
Well now you have to watch bad match with us.
5:37 I've been afraid (scared) to watch movies with this actor since Oz prison  😹
Oh exactly, the first guys from the serial scream!! I haven't thought about them for a long time 🫣
I dont understand how this game works...
This video is the birth of Dylan’s kissing booth franchise
bad match is still 100% after 3 years 😂
“don’t recommend movie trailers” oh how the turns have tabled
can’t believe they got both brooke and noah from scream tv show for this movie
For there being so many familiar faces in The Late Bloomer (Jane Lynch, Paul Wesley, That one guy, smth simmons, others i don’t know the names of) I’m shocked that the main character is someone I’ve never seen before.
This jumper is so freaking pretty
Wait… halfway through the trailer, I’ve actually seen the late bloomer…
the late bloomer, the tumor was in his brain pressing on the pituitary gland but it’s not that important
mary shelley is the author of frankenstein how did you not know that dylan 😭
5:59 Ngl Paul Wesley definitely caught me off guard the cast in that movie is crazy
16:35 I feel like if she showed up behind him and said "hi" in a obscure tone other than just jumping and screaming whilest holding a knife, it would be way more frightening lol
dylan calling jk simmons a c-lister hurt my very being
No offense but your sense of humour is dead you don't find anything funny ngl
i love work it...
Lmao I just started watching TVD so seeing Paul in The Late Bloomer took me out
Bad match is not funny because women ruin men's lives like that all the time I hear stories men in prison falsely women accusing men of assault women accusing men of rape how do you think that's funny
Teens are Gen z, Dylan. Millennials are… you
we aren’t millennials you silly goose
“Work it”  Me: oo they have more diversity maybe there will finally be an Asian character that represents me for once  Asian girl with the dyed hair streak   God damn it   No hate it’s just let’s get representation for struggling classical musicians that have to struggle with the dynamic of picking passion over family.  Movie: nah nah let’s just have this white girl have to pick one of the 2 personalities. Being good at dancing, or Getting good grades.   And thus Work it was born   I mean thank god they didn’t make it accurate though..that movie was..a ride
I've seen keeping up with the jones' pretty predictable but enjoyable to watch  I thought
HELP WHY DID I ACTUALLY FREAK OUT WHEN PAUL WESLEY CAME ON SCREEN
1:51 My first thoughts, "Oh it's Noah from the Scream TV series, and the bad guy from Howard the Duck." 2:12 What! Brooke from Scream TV series is in this too? Lol. Wasn't expecting that.
Love you Dylan and your videos
8:11 my guess was 20
My guesses ( I gave myself a 15% difference)   Premature: 11% ❌ Late bloomer: 28% ✔️ Keeping up with the Jonses: 32% ✔️ Bad match: 12%❌
7:44 ncis person sloane i think
6:00 !             PAUL WEASLEY
Why have I watched most of these films ffs
rEaCt tO eNcAnTo
I hope these videos get brought back. This is the first video I saw from Dylan
WORK IT IS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE
Dylan Guessing & Rotating is hilarious...
Wait what? Snl guy was a youtuber!????
Bad Match is SO good because its all about over thinking and blaming others. It's so good
The bad match movie seems like exactly what women fear every time they go on a date
Bro if you were thinking about anything except sex every 7 seconds you would be institutionalized
I pray to god Dylan never comes up against a women with a kitchen knife he gunna make the wrong move
I kinda loved The Late Bloomer tbh, genuinely surprised me, soundtrack ain't half had either, Jack White's 'I'm Shakin' was really well placed.
why did i think dylan have rashes on his arm when it's just the design of his shirt 😭
that first trailer shook my brokenheart over Scream (tv show)
Bad match only had 8 people review it.. The average score was 100  The audience score only had 179 people review it and it still only got  42percent That means it's REALLY bad.
LMAO He did NOT have tumor in his PENIS! What about that made you think that would work or cause puberty delay --- The tumor was in his PITUTARY GLAND!! It's responsible for triggering puberty, HGH hormones etc.. .But you, HIS PENIS MY GUY WHAT!
Punch or... vagina chop 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So idk how the movie is but personally the Trailer for work it gives me step up vibes but like make it bad? idk maybe that's just me
ive seen late bloomer it's been years but it is funny
I'm amazed by the way we learn storytelling details everyday with Dylan while being entertained 🤣
Wait that second movie the way the cast is coming in and all known is giving me The Rocker vibes. PLEASE do some kind of reaction to The Rocker. I hardly know anyone who has seen it and it’s so hilarious! 😂😅
"All C list actors" I can't believe Dylan called Academy Award Winner JK Simmons C list, the man is a treasure.
9:50 It's like they took a mash-up of every piece of niche internet lingo that people use ironically and put it into the dialogue blender.
He had a tumor in his pituitary gland, not his penis. lol
Even though I'm not convinced it'll be good, I've been looking for another time loop movie to watch, so Premature (2016) it is!  I will not update you all on if it's any good.
Bad match has a somewhat "i dared my best friend to ruin my life" vibe
dylan, the pituitary gland is not in your penis 😭 it's a part of your brain
I love that almost all these movies are movies that I’ve seen and have never heard anyone talk of so part of me used to think some of these movies just didn’t exist
Dang i love your shirt
5:11 OMG IVE SEEN THIS MOVIE IT WAS SO WEIRD ASKDKSKKSKSDJSKBDUFHR
I wonder how many comments I could get away with just straight up objectifying him before i become spam?? (Although I'm obviously trying to be gleb, as far as that previous sentence I haven't watched enough videos to be sure how "you" identify. so if it's not "him", please replace that part of the sentence). I just looked it up. Classic.  Wisconsin.  I really have to get myself there.
i’m so glad dylan doesn’t think pimple popping is nice
Dude, dude, JK. Simmons is not C list okay lol
Tell me your opinion about the first movie you clicked on, '' the first time '' with Dylan O' brien
Really enjoy watching these videos! It's fun when you stick to a theme too, like comedy or romance or thriller.
Dylan: 38% Me: 48%? Dylan: 48%? Me: oh hells yeah
Work it is actually good tho LOL
You should try and watch international movie trailer and compare them to the hollywood movies w same genre! Or just rate them! You will realize there’s a lot more amazing movies rather than hollywood production!
9:47 is that Wally West?
I saw that really bad dancing thing and it was like worth nothing
Omg 69k likes
jk simmons c list?? the audacity
Not Dylan just not commenting on the fact that Paul Wesley was in that movie, when he's commenting on everyone else. Like, there were so many joke opportunities and he just didn't give us a joke. Come on Dylan, do better.  AND, he didn't comment on Keiynan Lonsdale, like damn DYLAN!!
JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖
I watched The Late Bloomer by accident somehow and it was bad but i had such a good time tbh
Me watching Paul Wesley in second movie's cast 👀
When I made my guess for the 1st trainer and chose the exact same number as Dylan, I was shook 😱😱😱😱
yo bad match is actually good, I watched it thinking it would suck so hard but the plot is thick af
Dylan please watch Birdemic!! Its the best worst film in history!! You will love it
Someone please make a GIF out of 10:16   I relate to that eye roll so hard. I need it.
the sentence "american pie like movie" is enough to make me not want to watch a film god i hate the american pie film series
In american pie like movie trailer did anybody notice the five ways to say no movie poster in his room...
I was not expecting to see paul wesley 🤚🏻
for sum reason movies in general hit different when it’s in spanish the funny commentary is what makes it the best! just my opinion
Paul Wesley just makes anything automatically worth watching
Not Dylan uploading a video that was filmed monnnnnthhhs ago 🥲🤣 anyway still here for it lmao
Not Dylan calling J.K. Simmons a C-list actor 🥴 8:19
7:06 lol the doctor definitely said tumor on his“pituitary” aka his brain…NOT  on his penis
Work It has an 85% score. Not sure how.  Also Bad Match with 100%? That's a lie
Now I really want to watch Bad Match bcs WTF 100%?????
I love how he called paul wesley "Vampire Diaries Guy" idk why that was so funny to me but dont disrespect him like that😭✋🏻
Concerned that Dylan doesn’t know that the pituitary gland is located in the brain and not the genitalia
I’ve been watching these videos for a while and I still have no idea why gaius julius ceasar is in the background
The vampire diaries guy AkAPaul Wesley
Did dylan call whiplash a short film? it's a full length movie
Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein
i actually didnt hate Work it!
Can you do commentary to Hot Rod plz
If Lili Simmons wants to get freaky with me, bring it! Sometimes it IS that simple honestly. I have to believe she went crazy because he rejected her. So just don't reject the beautiful woman and have a good time!
Bad Match looks like a Lifetime movie
C list .... C list?? Did you just call JK Simmons a C lister? 😂
dylan: we’re just chillin’ me: chillin’ like late night dylan
I like your shirt
SABRINA CARPENTER MY QUEEEEENNN
Alan Tudyk. Sold. I'm watching this next. Thanks Dylanisintrouble
2:15 ...she’s good at *what* Dylan
my friend was in the movie work it
*13:02** keepingupwiththejoneses*
noah??? brooke??? hello??
Paul Wesley 🥰
Work it was actually pretty good tbh
9:47 IT’S WALLY WEST
He had a tumor in his pituitary gland in his brain. Not his penis. 😂 The pituitary gland is responsible for hormones, puberty, growth, etc.
6:05 this movie was actually pretty funny.
Everyone be making funny sarcastic comments and I’m just here screaming STEFAN!!! STEPHANNN (Kai voice)
10:38 The trailer doesn't do the movie justice. Work It was actually good
Wait that's Paul Wesley? Dylan recognised him from vampire diaries first and last episode!!
Millennials are starting to turn 40. Teenagers are not millenials. They are Gen Z.
Netflix just doesn't quit getting 28 year olds to play high schoolers do they
2:14 Both the main character and that girl were in the MTV show Scream together as Noah and Brooke
Brooke and noah 😍
Love the purple chill zone vibe 💜💜💜
Late bloomer  Keeping up with the Joneses   We saw both they were not great but they are watchable 😁😄😜😝😂🤣
I love the purple chill vibe 💜💜💜
Okay, since you already did a nether film fron Damien Chazelle, and you referenced whiplash (the short) please do a video on the whiplash feature.
I saw keeping up with the joneses and it was terrible it’s deadass just Mr and Mrs smith meets neighbors
Millennials aren't teenagers...
Chillin' with Dylan
I've actually watched the late bloomer only because the trailer popped up on my youtube. I also watched keeping up with the Joneses and it wasn't terrible I'd give it a 7.5/10.
Lol, that last one looked the worst and then you looked at the score, wow
Didn't see that twist, but certainly makes it more interesting than it seemed initial
apparently my boyfriend saw premature and was telling me about it and I remember Dylan watched the trailer and apparently it has a cute lil ending lmao.
I can't remember exactly but I swear I the ending of Bad Match being (and it does go like full on horror) really gory and fucked up 🤣 worth it just for that part honestly... Just watch the last 15 Mins or whatever 👍
Why THE FUCK is this channel so good what the hell
I don’t know but... Chilly dilly or chillin with Dylan 😬
Really, DYLAN? You’re CHILLIN’?
6:00 PAUL WESLEYYYYY
Dude millennials aren’t teenagers. They’re 30s and 40s now for the most part.
I knew it was gonna be a chick who was gonna be obsessed with him😂😂😂
It's weird how what he found funny, didn't even make me smile. But what he didn't find funny made me chuckle
I only watched the late bloomer because of Paul Wesley
Dylan, jubilant: who's good at this? Me guessing better than dlyan 90% of the time: me, bb
0:36 I kept trying to scroll up more to get rid of the search thing, and it wasn't until I paused it to see wtf is happening that I realised it was his... Im such a dumbass
Not to burst your bubble, but squirrel friend, stank, etc - are really things kids say these days, because that's what they hear on reality shows... The world gets dumber by the minute these days, and the English language doesn't look like it'll make it unscathed.
I don't I think he would be happy about the fact that "Work It" has like an 80% tomatometer ... Ahahaha
PaUl?
Man I love bbno$
I said the last trailer is 12 or stupidly high like 90...  I wasn't prepared for that.
I got a heart attack when i saw Paul Wesley!🥰❤🤣🤣
I love this series!!
Keeping up with joneses I watched that while playing sims. It’s a bad movie but hey I like Jon hamm and that’s why no regrets 😂
the late bloomer is supposedly based on a true story
Im finna watch all these
Keeping up with the joneses has a stellar cast to be rated the way it is. I love Jon Hamm and Isla Fisher, the writing and direction of the film is just dated
The Liza Movie was absolute trash. We don’t speak like that AT ALL. Also we aren’t millennials.
I guessed 48% first one lol
Ok if that last one were actually good. Itd be subtle, similar to "You" that stalker show on Netflix. And the planting p****graphy would be the big twist maybe even after he thinks its all over with. Cause thats how it be with real stalkers.
him being so unimpressed by the trailers is funnier than the actual trailers lmao
7:18 I CANT BREATHE😂😂😂
Plz stop saying dog it’s just cringey
Millennials are in their 20s Dylan, like you. We ain't teens 🤣
WHY THE F IS STEFAN IN THIS CRAPPY LOOKING MOVE!!!!!
OK DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT THE DOOR OPENING IN THE FIRST TRAILER SOUNDED EXACTLY LIKE THE VENTS OPENING IN AMONG US??????
bing bong, ling long ?
I thought him getting hit by the red car was hilarious 😭
My humor is so broken that I've laughed about everything and then felt bad when Dylan said it's not funny
GUYS LETS GET DYLAN TO 1 MIL HE ALMOST THERE YASSSSS
OMG JOHN AMBROSE
2:15 is the weirdest thing i have ever seen
literally the title says thriller and you were surprised it went scary l
i- women can be stronger than men... and can be more of a logical fighter than a man.. :/
How did we all just miss Paul Wesley in that one trailer
Dylan: “What is this cast we’ve got this person, this person, this person, VAMPIRE DIARIES GUY”  Me: *throws phone across the room* he has a name you know: Paul Wesley.   (Sorry I just got rly triggered bc vampire diaries is my favorite thing)
Me just watching cuz I’m bored: Also me:ITS PAUL WEASLY
Did Alan Tudyk owe somebody a favor?
I even liked trailer number one, but those score is way too low.
No fucking way this was 6months ago.... I swear this was uploaded the other week
I’m just a little triggered that he said he had the tumor in his mail parts when the doctor said he had the tumor and his pituitary gland which is in your brain I don’t know why that made me a little sad that he got it wrong.
Bad dating experience? Talkabout TokyoGhoul
I know you probably won't but I'd actually check out Bad Match! There's kind of a reason why it's got a higher score. It's not the best movie but pretty decent! The trailer actually doesn't tell much about the movie, shockingly.
The intro <3
When he was watching the second trailer and I saw Paul Wesley I was like- wow
came here cause i just woke up and read “five minutes” instead of “5 months” and thought Dylan posted again 💀
Paul Wesley went from Vampire Diaries to that crap film!?!🤚🏻💀
You're too good at guessing anything to do with movies.
I want that shirt. XD
“Are we scared tho?”  KKSKSK
5:56 no one me PAULLLLLLLLL
I guessed 48 for the first one too😂😂😂😂
fun fact: groundhog day was filmed in the Woodstock Square in Illinois:)
React to the whole movie of Work It
Just chilling, with Dylan! 😂😂       *I'll see myself out*
Bad match is basically a new version of that Michael Douglas film where a man is stalked by a girl who he had a one night stand with
Keeping up with the joneses is actually pretty good
I loved Late Bloomer!
Bad Match was good for a Netflix movie. I also enjoyed keeping up with the Jones
Work it will always be one of my favorite movies
nvm
wow, you'd be so easy to kill 🤣 bold move to advertise that on the internet...
At 6.03 I gasped bc Paul wheasly is in it 😭jxksksk-
Stefan Salvatoreeeee
He just gained 4,000 more subs in the last two days?! Nice, Dylan! Glad people are now find this guy.
You are really bad at anatomy because the pituitary (gland) is most definitely not in the penis... It's in the brain, but it does control hormones
When I actually know some of the movies
I’ve only seen work it
Im always shooting too high with my guesses cause i feel bad for the movies,,, wishing they turned out better than their trailers lol
Bad match Dylan: I didn’t think it was a scary movie YT Name: ...thriller HD
I WANNA SEE U WATCH WORK IT I LOVED JORDAN FISHER IN IT AND I LOVE SABRINA CARPENTER
omfg wtf was the late blomer cast what the frick how is no one talknig about this
I feel like that movie Bad Match is just her ruining his life for no good reason. Like, if you asked the Director "But why is she doing it?", his answer would be "Cause she's a psychopath, obviously." without thinking about it. It's like having a fantasy movie, where characters do something out of fucking nowhere that ends up being essentially a Deus Ex Machina without it ever being showcased that it's possible before, and if you ask the Director about it, his answer ends up as "Cause magic".
The Late Bloomer is proof that a star-studded cast does not necessarily make a good movie
omfg the tumor wasn’t on his peen it was on his PITUITARY gland 🤣🤣 I can’t believe you thought the former and still got the score right
the fact you actually make the sound and motion of going through a Rolodex when thinking of someone’s name is remarkable considering your age lol
Mary Shelley was actually good and I'm not a fan of Elle Fanning.
PAUL WESLEY!!!!!!
JANE LYNCH!!!!!!
The last movie is actually really good.
I actually really liked Keeping up with the Joneses maybe it’s just me tho
Just a correction: Millennials are people born between 1980 and 1995, so we're all adult by now. It's the Generation Z you're thinking about Dylan
"Premature" is a bad title as it is, but you know what? in Italian they chose the title "Io vengo ogni giorno" which means "I come every day", and I think it's way worse!
“Vampire Diaries Guy” I fucking lost it lol
I watched Premature ages ago and i actually enjoyed it
I have fully been watching your content for about 7 hours straight
Work it is actually really good
PAUL WESLEY I LOVE YOU MAN
the late bloomer is the worse fucking movie I have ever seen. it makes the kissing booth an oscar nominee
Im proud that he remembered paul wesley... Kinda
I love how ”The first time.” is in the recommended for the beginning of the movie and then in another video he watches the  ”love and monsters.” trailer. They just know he loves Dylan O'Brien.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING UR VIDS FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY...  You should watch W: two worlds. It's a korean series BUT IT IS WORTH YOUR TIME. Not the biggest fan of kdrama myself but this one is AMAZING.
I know most of these movies are bad... but now I want to binge watch them all... Thanks, Dylan!
Bad match was 100% because the girls that watched were like “all the guys that play with emotions low key deserve a crazy girl like that” or is it just me? 😂
Work it was boring and cliché for me. Still love the actors though.
Bru that was Paul Wesley
Keeping up with the Joneses movie is actually pretty good.
Keeping up with the Joneses is actually not that bad. But maybe it doesn't hit American humour as much as German humour.
Dylan looked miserable during the Work It trailer
You know a horror movie has failed when its premise is "angry date with knife"
With the netflix movie, I was basically dying with laughter throughout the entire trailer for just how stupid it is, and the only times I stopped laughing were when they actually told a joke...I think that's probably a pretty good indicator for the quality of this writing.
For the first one, some of the shots showing a daily routine are really common with these groundhog day plots. That being said, I wouldn't have called that in a million years.
*Movie trailer reverses* Me: Wait so, its like a groundhog day situation Dylan two seconds later: Wait, what?! Its like a groundhog day situation. Me: *sketched out*
Dylan baby, a pituitary tumor is in the brain, not peen
Bad match wasn't scary but it was creeeeeeeepy!!
You need to watch work it. The trailer is bad but the movie is really heart warming
Poor Paul Wesley being forever referenced as Vampire Diaries guy.
PLEASE DO LOVE IS MONSTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It’s on amazon.
Well that changed my opinion on Noah Foster [Scream MTV series]
not to be * that * person, but the tumor was in the pituitary gland lol either way i think that’s scientifically inaccurate
yes that was me at 3:52 he was like thats not even funny i am like dude that was hilarious
I FUCKIN LOVE YOUR VIDEOS THEY'RE LIKE THE LIGHT IN MY DARKEST HOURS DUDE YOU ARE A M A Z I N G. my personal heaven would be watching shitty movies and making fun of them with you.
So admittedly I’ve seen Bad Match and I remember it being surprisingly good! Shockingly enjoyable.
Squirrelfriend is what I call my squirrel friends 🐿️
PLEASE DO WORK IT
How did you go from the douchy looking dude from a year ago to the nerdy looking dude you are today? I'm so confused.
Why's American humor in movies so gross
I thought late bloomer was really funny
I've seen late bloomer year's ago
when you realize great actors are in bad movies too
I love this series.
I SAW PREMATURE IN THE THUMBNAIL AND I NEEDED WATCH THIS
HIS NAME IS PAUL WESLEY!!! Stefan from tvd
seeing that Jeff’s barbershop is also recommended to Dylan😌✨
I saw the movies Premature - Not great, I laughed a couple times. It's was alright  Meet the Joneses - It wasn't too bad, I laughed, I did like the cast so that's probably why I liked the movie.
The feeling when you've seen both Premature and The Late Bloomer haha. Tbh I actually liked Premature but The Late Bloomer did suck haha
Bruh in the late bloomer there is frikin Paul wesley
premature is actually a really good film its one of my favorites
The pituitary gland is in your brain not your penis
stating this dude could overpower a woman with a knife just because he's a dude is a tad presumptuous, i mean i've never seen the movie but for all any of us know this woman could be skilled with a knife, she could have killed many others. just cause she's small and a woman does NOT necessarily mean that he could easily overpower her.
Keeping up with the joneses is actually not that bad ,its actually pretty good .
Chillin with dylan
i watched bad match and i also saw it on the channel Pretty Much It and it was higly enjoyable, that trailer made it look horrible though i will admit
I plan on watching all of these. So I can decide for myself if the movies really are this bad lol. And I really am the type to love trashy dumb movies lol
The first two are Netflix films I think
do one of these but horror trailers!!!
Dude as soon as someone says DO NOT, you know you do the shiz.
He should't be referred to as anything else other than "Young Neil"
The critics are one of the most useless things in the world!
Dylan: Let's watch the Netflix trailer next I hear the start of the trailer Dylan: Jesus Christ!!!! Me: Laughing like crazy rolling on the ground (because that was exactly my reaction when I heard it and I even stooped right there and did not watch the rest of it, that's how annoying it was for me) This is the first time that I will see the full trailer... only because it's in this video. :))
Tumor in the penis? Dylan you are funny :))  :)) No, he had a tumor in the brain that was close to the pituitary gland and because of that his puberty was suppressed and never went through it :))
Can someone please tell me where he got his lamps from??? They're so nice!
Premature is better than the trailer it was pretty good
Heard of The Late Bloomer, actually saw it. Was an odd movie
I actually really enjoyed bad match, great ending
Hey plz do a reaction on after we collided trailer and the movie
I continue to accurately guess the audience score😂
6:00 AAHHHSRGADFS  it’s paul wesley ☺️
I wanna steal that sweater I love those colorrrrsssss
Loo
Paul Wesleyyyy
The fact that these videos aren't called "Chillin' with Dylan" is such a missed opportunity
Hey Dylan! You should do some videos on your book writing and your knowledge on behind the scenes stuff of movies - Personally find it very interesting - just an idea :)
The Bad Match actually has a pretty damn good twist.
Work it was an AMAZING movie!!
Correction he had a pituitary tumor which is in the brain.  And I want to say it was based on a real true story. But I could be wrong.
Bad match was actually kind of interesting. It tries anyways. People should give the whole movie a watch, not a channel recommendation btw, but it goes places the trailer doesn’t really hint at.
I think he might like “ bad match”. Like if you agree
Me :seeing Paul Wesley
Imagine him watching bad match and rating it 100 as well
There was this time I didn't know what to with my life and I watched all these movies. It's so funny to see this now, but everytime I laugh with dylan I laugh about me.. 🙈🙈🙈
CAN YOU REACT TO AFTER TRUTH
Dylan can you do some more episode game play 🙏😁 also I love ❤️ you 😘😘💋
Wth i didnt know paul wesley in on The Late Bloomer
I think Work it was the worst movie of 2020 😂
I’d like to just say the pituitary gland is part of your brain.....he had a brain tumour
Bad match spoilers-kinda      Okay but tbf- I watched bad match without watching the trailer and was caught so off guard by what the guy does. It’s not a good movie by any means but you will enjoy it more than if you watch the trailer first.
Yoooo you should do happy death day
the work it movie wasn't that bad to me
*I NEED YPUR HELP PLEASE LMAO*  Hii i need your brains to find me a movie i once watched and then forgotten the name of So im pretty sure it was nicolas cage who starred in the film but dont take me up on that Basically a family (i think a dad and two kids, brother and sister i think) moved into a nee house (its an old mansion that looks haunted) the the story of the movie was that there was an invisivle line or a cirle in the front yard of the house in which if crossed you would see paranormal life and i think the daughter bot caught up in it and the dad tries to save her Thats all i remember but i hope you can help me, the movie and its name has been haunting me for so many years lol  Thank you in advance
You have got to do gameplay on Life Is Strange!
11:34 She looks really familiar?
All i wanna do is recommend everything for him to watch, but then he won’t watch it, so i get sad
No, the tumor is in the pituitary, that’s in your brain
me: giggling Dylan: That's not funny Me: oh never mind
Re: bad match DYLAN stop VICTIM BLAMING
Why is no one talking about him thinking the pituitary gland is in the penis
Don't dump on work it i love that movie
i watched the late bloomer on netflix about a year ago, it was actually pretty good. Also, Bad Match just sounds literally exactly like what Cro sang about in "Bad Chick"
How did Bad match have 100% by critics :D that is insane
With Dylan’s chill videos i really chill
work it wasn't good but i really enjoyed myself lmao
listen, bad match was a good movie
*Ironically, I thought Premature was the title for The Late Bloomer because I’d seen the trailer before. John Karna (main character) and Carlson Young(hot blonde) from Premature are pretty good main characters on MTV’s Scream. Cool to see them working together again even if it’s only in a trailer haha£
I love work it
I would love gim to react to "To all the bright places" I thought it was a really good movie but idk what he might think...
Dylan: so this plot is that he had a tumor in his penis that-- Me: no babe, no. that's not where your pituitary gland is
i want more people to know that this man exists. please tell ur friends about him.
I have seen work ot so gooood
Millennials are not teens, it’s literally you Dylan Jeez
LMAO the pituitary gland is not in the penis my dude
okay work it was actually pretty good and the dancers were really talented. it’s no step up but it’s definitely not bad!!
he should do a video on vampire diaries
We watched 'the late bloomer' in class. Yeah, that was an experience
I love how Dylan said Vampire Diaries guy. 😭I really thought he never heard of it.🤣
I have a honest request for your channel: not a recommendation!  Can you make a video (maybe a compilation) of moments in the movies that you loved but kept out of the video because maybe they weren’t funny enough or whatever? I’d really love to see that
The feeling when he misses after we collided😂
Ive actually seen Bad Match and its not horrible and the plot twist was like OH. Idk maybe the weed helped
I still can't believe "The Late Bloomer" got such a low score. I found the movie hilarious.
I like it, want more :)
lol! The pituitary gland is in the brain...
I love just watching trailers
Damn your vibe is beautiful
did. the audio cut out for a few seconds at 11:17?
I really need your shirt
I've seen bad match, the trailer is deeply misleading. But... Its still not a good film
Wait I swore you watched bad match?
wait, but keeping up with the joneses was actually good tho 0.0
Millenials are all adults now. Teenagers are Generation Z. I am Gen Z and I am 20!
Chillin’ With Dylan
I saw Keeping up with the Joneses last year and I remember thinking that it was really boring but had a few good scenes & jokes.  But I can't remember any of them lol
i literally watched premature and the whole movie slipped my mind
The doctor literally says "we found a brain tumor" at 6:14
I love this because there are so many times I'll watch one trailer on youtube and then an hour later i've watched a bunch of trailers for movies i'm never going to watch and
Chilling with Dylan🥵 sorry
Just so you know Dylan, Millennials aren’t Teenagers. Your a Millennial and the Movie with Liza Koshy is directed at Generation Z & maybe the younger Millennials
I saw Liza Koshy in that trailer and tried not to cringe out of existence.
Damn man it’s crazy. I watched you react to j Cole for your eyes only album and now look at you! Hella happy for you!
When you’ve seen these trailers but never the movies 😂😂
I’m ashamed I’ve watched most of the movies he reacted to😶
Chillin Dylan 😌
I actually enjoyed keeping up with the joneses..... lol
Am I the only one that checks out their Imdb score instead of Rotten Tomatoes?
Dylan: "Audiences will eat up trash. They will eat the rats. Audiences are RaTs"  Me: are you sure you're not a movie critic?
Looking for a comment where someone points out that Youtube recommended Jeff's video. Any vlogsquad fans here ?
That “Jennifer’s Body” guy is actually JK Simmons’ son.
I dunno if you watched this movie yet but there's this one movie called knock knock with keanu reeves  Which I love keanu reeves nut that movie was really bad its supposed to be a horror movie some sort so maybe u can check it out :)
I've actually seen the first four trailers before,, don't know what that says about my life
Someone framing you for cp is genuinely terrifying. You’d never be able to prove your innocence.
Work it was actually a really funny movie XD
9:17 Dylan the youngest millennial is 26
bro i hope i dont have a brain tumor on my what ever glad like the late bloomer does wish me luck at my next MRi
okay so i actually watched bad match before and it wasn’t that bad tbh lol i quite enjoyed it- i think i like movies that have the internet, obsession stuff, like unfriended and stuff like that lol
Lol I actually think I did see late bloomer when that came out in 2016! It was lowkey pretty funny. I thought it was worth the watch if only for just the cast.
Is it weird that I know some of these movie trailer and not the movie it self
40 year olds Are Millennials
Stefan Salvatore
Is Jorda Fisher from pretty little liars? I feel like yes but maybe no
Came to watch part 1 before I watch part 2
I have no faith in rotton tomatoes😑  why  is it even a go-to rating system🤔🤦🏽‍♀️
6:30 was the moment I realized I had watched that movie before 😐
“Groundhog Day meets American Pie” don’t you just love originality?😌 edit: the late bloomer is based on a true story btw
LOL the fact that I’ve watched “The Late Bloomer” 🥴 I have a thing for watching the worst movies I can find.
dylan pls tell me you’ve watched emo the musical
He has a tumor near his pituitary gland...that's not in the penis my man.
"Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness.." (Acts 17:30,31) That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Rom.10:9-10) For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." (Rom.10:13)  Repent, put your trust and faith in the Lord Jesus before it is too late.
i watched bad match on netflix it was dumb idk how it got that high of a review
Work it isn't as cringey as I expected
Omg please keep doing this series
Please watch Love, Rosie or Me before you
I saw Stefan and froze for the rest of the video 🥺
i actually like premature
Hey random thing But honestly in the new Live action Tangled If Dylan doesn’t play Flynn I’m not watching it!
I am patiently waiting for Dylan to release an enchanted commentary
Has there ever been a movie that has gotten a 0% or 1% on rotten tomatoes? Cause watching those movies would be crazy
So I think a Hamilton reaction is in order 👀
Omg WATCH MARY SHELLEY! It’s about the woman who wrote Frankenstein! It’s great!
For my sanity please upload stuff like this more often.
As soon as she  started praying to Beyonce, I knew to to watch...but alas, I got so bored I clicked on it...cringed at "swagger" then turned it off as soon as that coffee thing happened within 5mins
I’ve been without WiFi for a while so I came back to see the Jenna Julien podcast has ended and immediately, the next channel I click on is yours Dylan. Your videos are such a safe space for anyone feeling sad or alone so please never stop doing what you do because your fans appreciate it so much😊
Watch work it for until I hate myself please!!!!!!
I honesty never listen to rotten tomatoes because they're always giving good movies bad scores and some weird ass movie good scores like make it make sense
Please do work it
Try watching "Ronal the Barbarian". It's a VERY weird movie, it's animation but almost all jokes are for "adults" sooo... I hope you watch it because it's really strange and has a lot of fighting and killing which I know you like to see from your videos.
Dylan: I didn't know this was gonna go horror trailer title: Tinder Dating Thriller
You should react to The Half Of It
you.. you... you.. You skipped AFTER WE COLLIDED. After movies sequel😂😂
Dylan: I wasn't expecting it to go scary *literally says Thriller in the title*
Please react to HAMILTON!! You're gonna love it!
Bad match kinda looks like So I married an Axe Murderer but not funny
Hello dylan, i am usually a silent watcher i don't like to leave comments , but today i have something for you to watch, i know you don't take recommendations but i am going to try any way , i want you to do a commentary these movies please   1: ready or not  2: knives out  (Sorry if my english is bad , is not my first language)  thank you.
You should watch ragz! Its a nickelodeon movie and it was quite good in my opinion
Xmen
Man you got to try Hot Pursuit! A Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon movie! (Not movie trailer,just movie in general)
watch teen beach movie pleeease
You will know the truth 📖 and the truth will set you free. Free from the world the flesh and the devil 💀🔥 John 8:32   We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 NKJV👊🙂
Dylan:naming all the cast in the second trailer Me:omg omg!!!!! Stefan salvitor/Paul Wesley from vampire diaries is that u!!! 🤣
Can you make a movie commentary on ''movie 43'' please :D
u should definitely check out megamind, it's hilarious
Me: clicks on random Dylan video Dylan: talking about hsn less than a minute in Me: *cries*
Patiently waiting for the “Toodles” at the end.... You’re the man, Dylan.
I don't know how I found this channel, but I'm already in.
please watch banana split on netflix and do a video I think you'll like it
work it was actually not that bad - the best of the Netflix original movies
He had a brain tumour, the pituitary gland is in your brain lol
Bad Match was actually pretty good. It was twisted as hell. And you don't even realise until the last 10 minutes what was really going on. Its definitely not a perfect film but the concept was refreshing?
not a tumor in his penis 😂
watch bad match so we can be reassured that the 100% was rlly true
I laughed harder at the *dumb movie* part than any of the trailers💀
So on Bad Match, I gotta disagree with your comment that he could over power her. Two words: "Jodi Arias"
I got an ad for work it
are millenials still teenagers i thought millenials are all at least 25 or something now genz are the teenagers now
Dont even bother looking at rotten tomatoes scores, its nonsense half the time. Look at the audience score or the imdb rating cause those are normal people rating the movie. Gives u much more accurate indication of the movie
I'd like to know exactly why u haven't watched burlesque when it has Cam Gigandent AND Stanley Tucci🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Dylan your so                           *Chill*
should totally do more :3 like maybe each vid is 5 movies of the same genre and then each vid is different genres. just a thought! Whatever you do is gonna be awesome regardless bro :)
Someone make this guy watch “Legally Blonde” pls 😭
Movie trailers were the only thing not blocked on our school Chromebooks so I'm basically an expert
Uhh, here we go again with Dylan being sexist. Saying that any woman is weaker than any man 🙄  As a woman who has done taekwondo for many years, I can say with certainty that the attacker (regardless of gender) can cause huge amount of damage with a knife. The defender is extremely likely to get cut by the knife even those with marital arts experience, when trying to disarm someone. I would love to spar with men that say women can be "easily overpowered" and show them how wrong they are!!
Work It was surprisingly good. Like despite the cheesy jokes there were some parts that even made my mum laugh.....
Do a commentary on Astro boy or Jane the virgin
Can you watch Jane the virgin
I watched late bloomer. I thought it was funny at the time
The movie is like palm springs
I really wish he would watch The Wrong Missy
The oldest millennials are 40, don't u mean gen z
Dylan for a new movie review you shoud do a good one like "Life is Beatiful"
Premature is such a funny movie to me. I love that film. I know it's not well made but idk I guess it's like a guilty pleasure movie
This was a fun video! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking fwd to another one of these. 😀
Keep doing these!!!!! They’re fuckin great! 😂
Do you realize that millenials are over 20 now? We are old man, we are old...
these movies are all movies I completely forgot about but I feel like I've seen at one point or another
When you said movie trailers I got so excited, I watch movie trailers all the time but most of them give away the whole movie! You should keep this as a series!
MARY SHELLEY THERE *2(#&3(2&#(#*
i cackled when he mentioned 'wattpad/fanfics' because that's literally where i spend half of my day in lmao
i NEED you to react go euphoria
dylan bro you do know that you can click your scroll wheel to open a link in a new tab, right?
HE BROUGHT TOODLES BACK 😍
dylan should react to kdrama trailers
i actually liked the late bloomer and watched it at least twice. its kinda funny. i would rate it a 3/5 stars, i think 20% is too low
I saw keeping up with the Joneses. I really enjoyed it
Hope you do more of these types of videos !!
10:11 one of my biggest pet peeves in comedy trailers is the "you/we look like ____" joke, the writers think they can just dress the characters up silly and have them say "we look silly!" and it'll be instant comedy gold
DYLAN PLEASE REACT TO Disney's ZOMBIES 2 PLEASE ITS FUCKING TERRIBLE😂
Squirrel-friend is a RuPaul thing
Ok a huge fan and I know you don’t take Recommendations but I really think you will like  the greatest showmen
Has Dylan ever talked about GOT? I remember him mentioning that he hadn’t watch the last season and he was avoiding spoilers but did he ever finished it?  I would honestly love to hear what he has to say about that last season 😂
I've seen 2 of these movies and they are just as bad as they look in the trailer
PLEASE tell me you’re gonna watch Work It. It’s not a “good” movie but Sabrina Carpenter and Jordan Fisher’s parts together SLAPP. Still its totally perfect for your til I hate myself series and I’d love to hear your take on Liza Koshy’s bits and the writing overall
there's a British comedy called Saving Grace (2000) that you should react to! It's about a middle-aged lady who loves gardening and starts growing weed to pay for her dead husband's secret debt he left behind. It's extremely underrated!
WHAT IS CRAIG ROBERTS DOING IN THE FIRST MOVIE
I love the concept of this video! Please make another one!
DYLAN YOU ARE A MILLENIAL!!! GEN Z ARE TEENAGERS
Part two?????? Would love
I’d like to see a series of this, and what id like even more is to hear you say ‘toodles’ more often
It's not delivery, It's a pair
You look like a Disney character , for realzies.
Dylan: Block, throat punch Me (a black belt with a national title): Not exactly......
"Top or bottom, make a choice" Me, a bisexual switch:  👁👄👁
If you do this consistently(watching the trailers), it would be funny if you watched the movie with the highest rating to see if it was actually worth it, because from that last trailer, Bad Match did not need a 100% 😂
You should react to the season 2 finale of “Hannibal” out of context!
the trailer sucks for work it but I actually really loved the movie and i think you would like it.
I've recently just found Dylan and I've binged watch so many videos now BUT THIS MAN LOOKS LIKE SHAYNE TOPP FROM SMOSH AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME HE DOESN'T.
I got one guess right ayayay
YAS MORE OF THIS please
I glitched when I saw Paul Wesley like seriously
dylan i know u dont like recomendations.... BUT PLEASE WATCH EUPHORIA IM BEGGING YOU
I watched The Late Bloomer when it came out. So funny!
you can imagine my face when i see STEFAN OUT OF NO WHERE AND I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO SAY OMG THATS STEFAN FROM TVD BUT NO HE DIDNT AND IM NOT MAD IM JUST EXTREMELY SHOCKED AT WHAT IVE DISCOVERED TODAY edit: he said vampire diaries guy. i am content :)
React to after we collided trailer
Has anyone ever told you that your personality/humor is a bit like Seth Cohen’s?
do another one because i saw after we collided there and I was yelling at the screen for you to watch it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
Honestly bad match pleasantly surprised me, hear me out... it’s not that bad
Trailers don’t always show the integrity of the movie 🤷🏻‍♂️ Work it was a good movie and those jokes fit in the moment 😂
I hope you do a film commentary for Work It. I somehow managed to watch the whole film and it's as bad as the trailer.
Eh Bad Match was a pretty good thriller with a twist.
6:35 YES. YOU got it right
4:58 I guessed 50 I swear.   8:10 I thought the concept was more interesting than the previous movie but had a guy feeling it was bad. Even though when I watched the trailer years ago I thought it looked great. So based on that, I thought it'd be at least 50.
VAGINA CHOP
5:59 YO THATS PAUL WESLEY
I imagine the Indiewire comment for Premature like this: 2:56 Hilarious!😐 Groundhog day meets American Pie  Also, not a single "comedy" on this trailers was funny, or was that just my boring and lack of humor self? Your faces were funnier than this so call comedies
I liked Keeping Up with the Jonses!  ...  Maybe I just like Gal Gadot...
I avoided Hot Summer Nights like the plague because the poster was so terrible but it’s actually decent! It reminded me a lot of The Way Way Back.
his reaction to Bad Match, I guess he never watched Gone Girl lol
This video was cool, you should have more. Can I recommend a year though? I think you should go way back, like, 2008 or something. (Which is way back as far as movie trailers being on the internet).
can you watch vampire diaries
I’m sad that he didn’t point out Paul Weasly in late bloomer  Shit I just needed to wait 5 more seconds
I've seen Meet the Joneses at least 3 times because it's one of those movies that my mom would leave on when there was nothing else on tv, so I was actually kind of surprised that it's among the "movies no one has heard about"? lol
7:02 Dylan thinks the pituitary gland is in the penis?? 😂😂 Bro it's a gland in the brain
Bad Match is a actually decent movie, with a decent twist near the end
you definitely react to some of the movies who’s trailer you watch. definitely ‘Work It’ it wasn’t as bad 😭
Top or bottom make a choice => the gays entered the chat
work it was actually pretty good
wait lmaoooo the pituitary gland is not in the penis tho?? the trailer definitely suggests that so I don’t blame him for thinking that, but just goes to show how dumb that movie is bc how would they diagnose a tumor on a tiny gland in the brain from him getting hit in the balls
Dylan is chillin'?
I wa5ched Bad Match. It was just super low budget thriller. Not horrible but I wouldn't watch it again.
The late night dylan videos have come a long way. The budget has AT LEAST tripled
for bad match i was like theres no way it's more than 13%   and then it was 100%
A tumor in his pituary gland, not his penis
neeeeeed moreeeee  good stuff
Me hiding cause I’ve seen 4 out of these 5 movies 🤦🏾‍♀️😭
Maybe include reading some reviews in these vids !!
Bro work it wasn't bad it was actually pretty good
He had a BRAIN tumor up against his pituitary gland not on in his penis. Did u actually listen?
I... kinda want to see Bad Match now
Today in “Dylan doesn’t know where body parts are”: pituitary gland   7:03
I liked Work It thooo
For bad match she doesn't need to overpower him to be scary, the trailers weird, but if it was psychological it could be good. Actually just saw the movie recommend.
"ewwwww  so gross"  Now THAT was "LOL funny"
Have you ever imagined you’re on “head over heels” (we dont have the budged to be on tinder) and then your life turns into a really bad horror movie? And the bigger plot twist about that is that the movie is 100% on tomatometer
I would totally binge watch this series! Please make more
Do NOT recommend.
That Gucci necklace
I'm sorry, but are we gonna just skip over the fact that Dylan thought the guy had a tumor in his penis? I cackled omg, the pituitary gland is in your brain, that was the funniest shit ever, golden Dylan moment right there XD
Aren’t some millennials in their 30s now
At 2:26 the "what keeps happening" scream in the background sounds like pewdiepie.
OMG please react to the ‘after we collided’ trailer!!
Really creative idea for a video gotta admit.
Part 2!!
Really enjoyed this video Dylan😉
this isn't chill zone. this is cringe zone.
thank god youtube recommended dylan's channel,, HE'S SO FUNNY
People: I recommend __________ Me: don’t just don’t
Anyone else recognize that guy from the perks of being a wallflower?
How about you do a video where you watch every Timothee Chalamet movie trailer, even if youve already seen the movie/trailer!  Edit: technically I didn't recommend a movie 😌
you saying my husband timothee chalamets name....offt 🥵
This is the first video I've ever watched of yours and yes I would love more like this. Now I'm going to be watching all your videos tonight.😁
Woah 2016 was 4 yrs ago 😬😅
Would love this as a series
That jumper tho
I remember watching keeping up with the joneses at the movies when it came out and I was so disappointed lmao
Should I watch bad match until I hate myself
He had a tumour on his BRAIN Dylan not his penis...I swear you watch stuff and don't hear half of it lol
Premature: I hate it when an interesting premise tricks an actor I like into being in a garbage movie.  The Late Bloomer: Does this man never go to the doctor? How did he reach 30 without anyone realizing he never hit puberty? Either his parents should be in jail for neglect or his doctor(s) should be sued for malpractice. Also, someone sold their soul to the devil to get that cast because WTF, HOW?!  Work It: "Squirrelfriend" made me want to die.  Keeping Up With The Joneses: The Incredibles 2 also did the thing where a parent is in the middle of a mission and the family calls about some domestic problem only 1) it was actually funny and 2) it highlighted how good Helen was at being both a mom and a superhero by being able to multitask like that even if it was just for a few seconds.  Bad Match: See, this is why you can't trust a good rating when there's only been a small number of reviews. The only reason Bad Match's score isn't in the basement is because the only people who saw it were friends and family. That's what I'm assuming happened unless that thing is secretly funny.
You should react to Bad match since it has a 100%
He really said millennials😂 we are the gen z no millennials remember that.
John😍
I love this series idea!!
Well at least 2020 there isn't gonna be a single movie this bad, maybe they'll just stop doing these... Like forever?
Work it isnt worth seeing. The girl Sabrina plays is like so bad at dancing its cringy and you have to turn it off... I’ll admit i fast forwarded through most of it because it was so bad. But its just soooo bad
WATCH FRED 1,2,3
WATCH THE TRAILER FOR AFTER WE COLLIDED
i dont understand how no one can figure out how to make a good comedy trailer. one trope that is just too cringey to handle is the upbeat music at the beginning of the trailer, then the music stops for a character to make some lame joke as if you're being shown a neon 'laugh now' sign. it's so forced and uncomfortable.
Literally just finished watching work it...I liked it🤷🏾😅 Edit: Me and dylan both guessed 15% on the last one...we were SO very wrong😔
Guess I'm the trashiest rat 🐀, 30 going on 15 cause these movies look funny to me hahahah
Me seeing Paul Wesely🥰🥰🥰🥰
I don’t know why and I don’t know when... but I have seen all of those trailers 😂
How did bad match get 100%??? I couldn’t even sit through half of it
Why did I think the late night dylan segment was called dylan after dark?
Heyy Dylan!! Fan from Brazil here 💚💙 I was thinking, why don’t you do a movie commentary video about silly horror movies like Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer, i’ve watched it another day and in a lot of parts i could just thought what you would say!!! Please read this commentary, please do a video like that!!!
Bad Match was weird but the plot twist was pretty cool
Timothy Schalmet wasn't in that movie.
Keeping Up with the Joneses is actually pretty good.
Idk bro a lot of this shit was funny
I thought work it was gonna be a cliche cheesy movie but it was actually pretty good
dylan, ur shirt looks like the girls wetsuit from spf-18
You are not fooling no one, you saw the trailers before recording
We actually saw Late Bloomer in school... yEAH
DYLAN! would you react to Hamilton?
Older generations got project X and shit - we get Wattpad stories 😤
Bad Match is better than the trailer makes it look but it could definitely be better
i LOVE this concept
I think you should definitely base the scores off Google users instead of Rotten Tomatoes, I feel like it may be more accurate
Please react to never have I ever on Netflix
u have to watch bad match its actually so good
Really want you to watch game night
Dude I *lost it* at vagina chop and I don't know why.
The Birth of a Nation (a horrifically racist movie glorifying the KKK) has 93% critic score and a 56% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, while also having a 6.3/10 on IMDb and getting 32% of Google reviewers to say they like the movie. So yeah, don't trust that shit.
the second trailer you watched is based on a true story😳😳
I've watched keeping up with the Joneses my mom made me she watches the wierdest stuff
Keeping up with the Joneses was actually funny I don’t care what kind of rating it got.
Ok when I saw Paul Wesley form Vampire Diaries in that one trailer not gonna lie I was like maybe I’ll watch the movie just cause of him😂
this is so funny i have actually had a tumor on my pituitary gland and what it does is make the gland produce more than its supposed to, so the actual logical plot wouldve been that he was growing out of control his whole life and would have a massive dong
"vagina chop" rlly got me
7:21 SHE'S THE COACH FROM GLEE omg
5:08 lol I literally subscribed to Jinnytty like a week ago, cuz she got recommended to me
i love this! Continue with the trailers! You look like you are in hell <3
Lmaoo the intro about tik tok drama is such a mood, I literally just finished a video and came to this one and at the end of the last one I was also like: "why did I bother to watch this-"
seeing the 100% rating is scarier than the actual movie
My thoughts on Work It: Why is there a movie every five years where a white girl learns how to dance from minorities?
Dylan... You mean gen z not millennials. 40 year olds are millennials
I randomly watched Bad Match when it came out and it was one of the shittiest movies I've ever seen. I only continued watching because I had watched so much of it I figured why not just finish it. It had a plot twist in the last 5-10 minutes that ended up being really good (I thought). I'd never watch it again because of poor execution, but I told multiple people about the plot after the fact and it SEEMED like a great idea.
I totally forgot about the Late Bloomer movie cuz I remember wanting to see it and now I'm just like....why?
i've seen bad match, its def not 100 %. but its decent.
I can't tell if dylan is wearing 1 or 2 shirts but either way hate the outfit😘
I love how he says "I could do this" and literally does it when he edits it lmfaoo xD This is why Dylan is awesome
Watching trailers for movies I’m never going to see is one of my favourite methods of procrastination 😅
trailer: he has a tumor in his pituitary gland dylan: HE HAS A TUMOR IN HIS PENIS????!?!?!???!?!?
I wanna see Dylan do this again but I want him to predict the plot lines. And then he can watch the movies later or not or read them or something I don’t really care. But I love to seen him watch the trailer and make a prediction!
Omg I thought 47% for the first movie 😂😂😂 (Let's not talk about my other guesses lmao)
hold up PAUL WESLEY? *Stefan is that you?*
give work it a chance, i liked it
can you react to the vampire diaries?
use imdb scores next time!
Goshhh he was sooo close to doing After We Collidedddd it was right underrrr one of the first videossssss😫😫😫
yo honestly bad match was a pretty solid movie imo
That was really messed up what he said about the guy overpowering the girl...
Ahhhh it’s chillin Dylan
I feel like with that last movie it was trying to be scary in like a real way but it would have been more effective if it was a woman who was being stalked because it’s more likely to happen to a woman than a man and therefore makes it much more scary
The really scary thing is that I’ve seen all these movies and this vid just reminded me thanks
I love Jordan Fisher 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Keeping up with the Jonses was actually pretty good
Advice for reading rotten tomatoes: always trust the audience score over the critic’s.
Off topic but The lighting colors + Dylan’s shirt. Bi flag we love to see it
Pls make a commentary video for Bad Match like... %100?? HOW :D
Bad Match, a re worked Fatal Attraction
The Work It movie is a lot better than the trailer makes it look. Sabrina and Liza are such a great duo and Jordan is really good in it too.
okay but this video idea is excellent, also i absolutely hate to admit this but i am pretty sure i have seen all of these videos unironically. but we move now i have somewhat good taste i promise. but also i'd be lying if i said that i didn't enjoy work it lmaooo
Me realizing that Dylan knows Paul Wesley's face well enough from TVD as to spot him from it just made my night for some reason. Idk its like I can rest easy knowing that he's experienced such great teenage fantasy drama  Also i feel like Dylan would have a fun time with "The Great". Its a bop
WATCH THE AFTER WE COLLIDED TRAILER
Hey Dylan, I recommend that you don't play Telltale's The Walking Dead video game in a video series. So, if you neglect to play it - that means you take recommendations. Choose wisely.
Why did Premature have Brooke and the nerdy kid from the Scream TV Show, that was such an excellent show - can they not be in that movie plz
Not A Recommendation but I was curious if you would ever do an anime movie review? You've done Crunchyroll as a sponsor a couple of times so I wanted to know. Please answer if you get a chance (^w^)
Dylan literally has the best channel but the only thing ruining it for me even tho I enjoy everything and will continue to watch is that he doesn't take recommendations like not even sometimes, come on dude we literally wanna see you react to the stuff we recommend
🥳 I WAS RIGHT. When I first watched this video, I thought this would be a new thing for commentators and movie reviewers to start copying. And now he’s trending! 🎉
6:16 nate's dad from gossip girl
This was a lot of fun. I think each time you should start with a specific genre then see what recommended you get from there
He clicked the trailers with hot, half naked women in the thumbnail and honestly I can relate 😂
I don’t know, I liked keeping up with the Jones’ 🤷🏽‍♀️
I honestly don’t like how he said that he was stronger than her... like she had a knife she could just throw it at him.. it doesn’t matter how strong he is... lol
Love the new series chill zone , chill zone with Dylan 😂❤️
can you please react to a kdrama called it's okay to not be okay it's currently on netflix and it's a really good drama and taught you many life lessons 🥺🥺
I'm shocked to know the pituitary is in the penis
Did I just see Stefan FREAKING Salvatore???????
I love that Dylan heard pituitary gland and thought yes, penis.
PREMATURE IS A GOOD MOVIE SOLELY DUE TO THAT CRYING GUY
I wanna see more of these
Work it is now on rotten tomatoes and has 84%
Dylan what makes u so triggered by suggestions?
j k simmons is a c-list ? i-
the best thing about Dylan doing these kinds of video....he's providing me with movies to watch
i do that and wow i have an 'aquired' taste
What? Dylan is trending?? He finally made it. Congratulations homie!
Bad Match have a 100% ??? Seriously? MY GOD I like this, is fun. I have never heard about any of this movies xD
If I recall correctly, I think Bad Match is that one movie Pretty Much It made a commentary on awhile back that had a good twist.
Love your chill vibes, life feels easy when I watch you 💕
The lady from the Joneses film is Wonderwoman
Work it is one of the best Netflix movies
'he had a tumor in his penis' Dylan please take a biology class oh my God. The pituitary gland is in the brain
Dylan would u ever consider making a video reviewing books or sharing your book recommends? maybe a mix of some good books and some trashy romance like how you do movies.
I prefer your movie commentaries over this
DYLAAAAANNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!! When's the next beer and a movie?
Your channel? My guess is at least 100%.
You should've read some of the bad reviews
Whiplash is not a short film lol
So weird that I finished Work It and the next thing I watched was this video 🤣 Also does it say somthing about me that I not only know of, but have seen, all of these except the last one 😂🙈    P.s. I know you hate recomendations but Dylan, you cant tease us with a Work It trailer reaction and not do a movie commentary on it? Just saying 🤷‍♀️
I don’t think you know how knives work.
this was fun, i like this :)
Yay #50 on trending!
Bad match is actually really good
Bad Match gave the same vibes as cringey Lifetime movies
Dylan should actually watch the bad match movie lol
The boy from ‘Scream’ got his own movie, good for him. Seems like he’s being typecast as an awkward virgin
Omfg I remember I watched Bad Match a long time ago in Netflix i didn’t remember the movie until it go to the “creepy” girl. Dylan do a review on it it’s so bad and I want to see your reaction on it
We Need Part Two
Dang Dylan, you keep getting on trending
I watched premature and i liked it but it wasn’t good. Like a guilty pleasure lmao
I’m like 75% sure the last one was edited on iMovie
omf you could do one of these that was just exclusively shark movies and it could go on forever
Bad Match is a plot twist movie that will leave you super confused, upset, and happy at once ✨I RECOMMEND IT ✨ (not for dylan, he doesn’t take recommendations)
Keeping up with the Joneses is actually pretty good.
Watch vampire diaries 1 season!
5 trailers? 5 movies. Do all LAIKA films 👀
rip at me having seen almost all of these movies
i need more of this
Did he say Whiplash was a short film?  It's nearly 2 hours long...
I remember the late bloomer.
I've seen the trailer for the first one and keeping up with the Jones. And seen work it.
I completely pulled this out of the deep recesses of my brain. I watched Bad Match, probably on Netflix or Hulu and wow it was bad. It tried to be scary but I had to fast forward to the end.
Dylan is trending in Australia
So Bad Match is just The Roommate with Tinder
You know, it would be interesting someday if you see a movie you havent seen before but with a different language, like seeing work it but in spanish dub, since you dont know spanish it would be funny to just see how you would predict the movie without even knowing what they are saying (btw If this isnt clear enough, sorry, I speak spanish, not english)
Dylan honey, the Pituitary Gland is in the brain.... They even said, You have a brain tumor.
god i do this all the time, spiral down a movie trailer spiral lmao but i always end up getting the romcoms/love stories/christian love stories that tell the entire movie in the trailer. if you do another one of those you should do those lmao.  also if you want a movie suggestion i suggest palm springs on hulu. it's got a groundhogs day theme to it but it's good.
the "Bad Match" REEKS of men in Hollywood wanting to be like "look, bad dating app experiences can happen to men, too!!!"
Dylan you're trending on YouTube! #50 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I sadly watched premature
this is so sick pls keep this up
Work it was really bad
Do not recommend got it
I feel like if you’re off by 30 or more you have to watch it and do a review haha 😂
I'm going to need more of these videos in my life along with watching the last episode in a series. Loving all the Late Nights with Dylan
I’m halfway so my guess is this - all the movies will be similar because they’re suggestions based on the other trailers he’s watched
“A tumour in his penis that stops puberty”  Dylan your pituitary gland is in your brain and it effects your hormones 😂
I saw the work it movie and I actually liked it
Not me knowing all the movies cause my sister watches movie trailers for fun 😂💀
Can you do a movie commentary on Work It?
Wow, The tiktok sweater
I love Keiynan Lonsdale so much omg my dance academy and love, Simon Stan is coming through
Omg The late bloomer is awful. I dont know how jk simmons ended there
sssssso you did all 2016 trailers next time do all 2017
Can someone who watched Bad Match please explain why it got 100% cause i can't see it
now you have to watch Bad Match since it's obviously a cinematic masterpiece
Millennials: 30 years old and not teenagers
Ok but like imagine dylan reacting to The Greatest Showman-
oooOOOoohh look at you Dylan, number 50 on trending👏👏👏
Keeping up with the Joneses was hilarious!... it's been awhile since I saw it though.
You should do another one of these
I think he needs to review Bad Match after that tomato score
I've seen all these movies except for the Sabrina Carpenter one. How? I don't know but it happened
Fam I relate to this guy, when my family is tryna get me to watch some dead movie kmt
Hahahaha I could comment on anything else but...Dylan is that a new shirt?
Bad Match actually isn’t that terrible, not a great movie, but it’s a fun watch with some not so subtle commentary on toxic masculinity
i’m disappointed that you didn’t react to the After We Collided trailer.
Dylan is trending He deserves it
did this man just say the pituitary gland is in the male genitalia  dylan i love you but -
i loooved this video, already want another one! You should definetely see JUST KIDDING hahahahhaha
I love your commentary. You should react to EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY. I would to watch it lol
What you need to do is now watch the movie with the lowest rating and make it an episode of how long until you hate yourself 😂
AHHHH DYLAN! YOU'RE TRENDINGGGGG
I really like Dylan’s shirt
you should review Work It, on Netflix
I like the video idea, but also where did you get your shirt? I want one
Dylan is on trendinggg cheyzzzzz
Did you kill Cody Ko and use his background?
8:21  Call J.K Simmons C list again Mufcker. I dare you. I double dog dare you.
dylan the youngest millennials are over 25. they`re not teens, gen z r teens. WE`RE THE ONCE TO IMPRESS NOW MUAHAHAHAHHAHAH
I saw Bad Match & it was actually pretty good. Even had a twist ending.
Late night chillin with dylan
do it again
The tumor was in his pituitary gland not his penis thats in the BRAIN
"Vampire diaries guy"  Don't disrespect Paul Wesley like that😔
how are you not at 1 million yet
You literally look so much like machine gun kelly it’s messing with me
I recommend watching Goosebumps 1 and 2
you should review some black movies like Boyz N the hood and love and basketball
This guy getting mad at the trailer not showing it’s repeating even tho it shows like 15 seconds in.
This would be funny with random product commercials too 🤣
YES WATCH WORK IT
bbno$???
Can you keep doing this series? I found this episode pretty funny and interesting.
that Liza Koshy joke in the work it trailer made me laugh so hard lmfao
Yesssssssssss TREEEEENDDDDDDINGGGG!!
Trailer recommendation, Project Power, watch it please Dylan.
HAHA I KNEW BASICALLY ALL OF THESE TRAILERS
Dammit I wanted to watch Work It for Jordan Fisher but it looks so incredibly shit
" a vampire diaries guys "
Who's gonna tell Dylan vagina shots don't hurt?
Me seeing the guy from scream (Noah...from the tv show): 👁👄👁 Brooke comes on screen:  Me: :0
I left a different video because I saw Dylan had a new video ;)
Dylans reaction to that last one is a commentary of itself about men and woman. A man flirts while being unattractive = rape. Woman tries to stab you, then frames you for being pedo = bad dating experience. Nutshelled as fuck.
Bad Match has a plot twist.
how the hell did that movie got %100 tho? I'm really curious
You should react to movie trailers from other countries with or without english subtitles
doctor in the film: tumor against the pituitary gland (the one that regulates basically the entire human body); no puberty Dylan: tumor in his penis; no puberty
Bad Match reminds me of lifetime movie, ngl
You should watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind if you havent. It was marketed as a comedy but its one of the most sad movies ever lmao
omg, you’re trending in the uk, i wasn’t expecting to see your video there
I'd love to see Dylan take a movie trailer that sucks, watch the movie, and then make his own trailer for it. I'd also love to see him direct a movie, he makes me what to major in film XD
UR TRENDING
i actually watched “work it” last night and it wasn’t that bad, but i enjoy the stupidest shit a lot of times… except “swiped” tho that was literal garbage
Late night Dylan trending? Wut up
I watched Work It and I... I cringed the whole time :)
Omg Dylan your trending 🥳🥳🥳
u look like Atlantis man
oh dylan... just you wait for the dance boner scene on work it...
React to WORK IT, a movie with Lisa Koshy, Sabrina Carpenter and Jordan Fisher🤯
I feel it's sad that I've seen all these movies, but can confirm that bad match is pretty good and work it is written so badly
Ok but Premature has one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. That entire movie is weird af but worth it for that one scene.
I have actually seen Bad Match. The Bad person is Not who it seems. Definitely not worth 100% . It's not horrible but not good .
Omg you're trending
Let's keep this series going, I love it.
i rated Keeping Up With The Joneses 3/5 stars on my movie review thread on Twitter
"Enough with the sex jokes"-  says the guy that pulls a sex joke every 2 seconds in every video ever.
I actually watched work it, and it wasn't half bad in my opinion. Yea, it was a cringey teen movie, but I've seen worse.
The Late Bloomer is trash, I never made it past 10 minutes it was so bad. But Keeping Up with the Joneses is actually hilarious and it has a great cast :)
Let’s be real, most of these movies were probably not created with the purpose of actually being a good movie. They were probably just created to launder money or something
I have never seen the late bloomer trailer so I was not prepared for Stefan Salvatore to be there
Why have I literally seen all these trailers tho? 😂
38th on Trending. Shit Dylan ain't a secret anymore
and vampire diaries fans notice Paul??😂
i saw the trailer for The First Time <3 love that movie
100%???? I guessed 7 lmaooo
watching Dylan just makes my day
dylan looks like if jesus smoked weed and had short hair
but like...Bad Match ....I f*ck with that movie if I'm being honest
WAIT I saw the trailer for the late bloomer before, I swear it mustve been on netflix or something because I never intentionally watch trailers for movies like that lol
Dylan have you ever seen the Disney musical “starstruck”? Its a fun musical
Omg your on the trending page 30# spot congratulations i hope you get more subscribers
Premature was amazing dude I love that movie
More
You’re on the trending page!
I'm so confused.. it the tomato meter bad or good? Please someone explain to me
Work it was pretty good. But I’m a dancer sooo
Are you related to bbno$
yesssss I loved this, do more!!!
You should watch tangled the series
where’d you get this shirt?
try to watch older trailers like from 2005 these are the worst😂😂
Who's going to tell Dylan that he, too, is a Millenial because the youngest of us are 26 hahaha
Hey you know you on the trending page right I'm not sure you been on the trending page before but I'm happy for you💗
U should watch the babysitter on Netflix
Watch Step Up sequel!!!
i know its so random but can you watch one direction: this is us movie for their special 10 years anniversary pls?
15:30 you're welcome
I watched keeping up with the joneses on TV. I liked that one.
"Vampire Diaries Guy" HIS NAME IS PAUL WESLEY. Put some respecc on my dudes name 😭
Movie: "Tinder Dating Thriller"  Dylan: "i DiN't ThInK tHiS wAs GoNnA gO hOrRoR"
I want Dylans look so bad, it's so cool, the floofy hai- it's Milo Thatch, he looks like Milo Thatch, and you know what? He looks good, to conclude, I want to look like Milo Thatch, but Dylan's Milo Thatch
how about watching movie trailers from different countries tho? could be fun trying to understand a movie without actually undertstanding everything they are saying. just a thought ahaha
Low key want him to watch so undercover 🙊
Need more of this
react to work it pls 🙃
Keeping up with Jones was actually pretty good
do work it please ☹💔
You're trending :)
wattpad era? you mean women writing romance stories instead of men. but men still are directing the films but we're getting there!
I love watching movie trailers. I can spend hours doing it.
Bad Match had 8 reviews from Critics on Rotten Tomatoes and they all basically said it was Fatal attraction but for the younger more modern Tinder using crowd. Yes there is a twist in the movie, I read the plot synopsis but haven't actually watched it and i feel like its a the kind of twist that will either make you feel cheated or will make you applaud depending on how well they pull it off. Seems like the critics thought they pulled it off well lol
To the person who is reading this :  You are amazing stay blessed stay safe and have a wonderful day
number thirty on trending???? hello???
my guy Dylan is trending.
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18
Thicc shirt
15:13 Don't be so sure about that Dylan. Have you ever heard of the Jodi Arias case?
Watching trailers is fun.... you should make a series of this :D
She turned off your alarm? She’s a psycho!
Everyone in that dance movie sucked, including the writers
You are correct, The Late Bloomer is a horrible movie. I was taken in by the cast and was so disappointed.
"Audience are rats." Truer words have never been spoken.
Trending? Fuck yea, Dylan. Congrats
nice sweater! :)
I watched The Late Bloomer for Paul Wesley and yeah, it was terrible.
I don't trust the tomato rating thing no way
“Vagina chop”
Keeping with joneses is actually good and funny
Maybe you could do a challenge or sth where you have to watch the movie with the best score out of those you guessed
DYLAN YOU’RE TRENDING
I feel so terrible that I have watched all of these movies.
A horror movie about a masked intruder - Hush. Basically, someone tries to kill a deaf lady who lives in the woods. Not a recommendation, just a statement.
Dang Dylan #30 on trending
have you watched Korean movies/shows?
so we just gunna ignore the fact he passed up the opportunity to the watch after we collided trailer?!
Good video can you this agian with animated movies you never seen or heard of
i remember watching keeping up with the joneses but i really dont remember anything because i was too busy looking at Gal Gadot
I'm embarrassed for knowing all these movies. My movie taste is garbage, it's true 🙈  Meet the Jones's was pretty good though. Super funny.
holy shit i guessed the last two audience ratings exactly right i'm about to quit school and become a fortune teller or something
I actually really enjoyed this concept! Nice series! More!
I won’t accept any Sabrina Carpenter slander I just won’t accept it
dylan not even realizing he is on the trending page for a while now
LOVED this
Dylan is backkkk aye
Dylan in a previous video: I hate someone saying Dylan’s chillin like a villain to me.  ~Dylan At the Beginning of the Video~  All the comments: Dylan’s chillin like a villain
nobody: dylan: *thats not funny*
I was hoping so hard he would react to After We Collided trailer. Anyone else?
Me wanting to recomend a movie but remembering that Dylan hates reviews
Omg Dylan is wearing a shirt with more than ONE colour? 😳 ... WERE MOVING UP PEOPLE 👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😁 proud of you D
I remembered the trailer for the guy going through puberty in his thirties and honest to god I thought it was a dream.
i feel offended now. i loved "Keeping Ip With The Joneses".
I so want u to react to Indian Matchmaking on Netflix🤣🤣 everything is wrong with that series
Love all and any video you put out so yeah do whatever that makes us see videos from you more often !
work it got an 83 i'm just saying
I would love if this became a series. There are SO MANY of these kinda movies that you might see a trailer for then never hear about again (lol that's how ya know it was likely bad). Keeping Up With The Joneses brought back some hilarious memories, I could tell the movie was not good even back then.
I wanna see him react to euphoria😭😂
No offense but you know you're movie is bad if Liza Koshy is the most enjoyable part
Liza Koshy is not funny. Her facial expressions are always the same.
Work it was good to me cause Liza is in it and Jordan fisher
Make this a series💕💕💕
omg hes trending
You’re on trending yay!!!
Dylan really made don't recommend me anything a thing
Was kinda hoping he would watch the After We Collided trailer. I wanna see his reaction after watching the first one
This is trending!!!
yes
Has Dylan ever watched k-drama?
Premature was surprisingly ok tbh
Dylan is so funny ahh
Mary Shelley it's about the woman who wrote the book Frankenstein, it's a wonderful movie
Millennials aren’t teenagers anymore, some of them are almost 40, I think you mean they are writing for gen z
I watched late bloomer because of the actors lol. And its better than the Jones one. Work it plot is so whack
I’d love to see more of the chill zone!
Can you watch princess and the bride its pretty funny
I hate American Pie. It’s so gross. Does anyone agree?
do Your reaction to carrie 2013
I love watching movie trailers
Now I'm not recommending to watch that last movie but.. with that score, aren't you a little bit tempted to find out how it got that score? lol
Surely watch bad match😂
Watch "this trailer"
React to "Gaga: Five Foot Two", please!!
i wanted him to watch the after we collided trailer LMAO
I DONT recommend Dylan to watch The Strangers, a movie about invasion. I definitely don’t recommend.
the late bloomer movie has very recognisable casts and then i realized I've seen the trailer before, i think on television. damnnn
EWWWW🤢🤢🤢 Anyone think Dylan’s shirt looks like he has massive burns on his arms, like raw and veiny 🤢
*Paranorman*
I recommend Bad Match
I went through a phase where I watched all these random trailers along with the actual movies. Not the best phase of my life.
Try watching Bollywood movie trailers or doing a movie commentary for those.
Congrats on #18 on trending!
I really like this Dylan. I never thought watching bad movie trailers with you could be so funny. Hope you keep this going
You should watch A Quiet Place. It’s a lot like bird box.
So is no one going to mention that the pituitary gland is in the brain not the penis?
Dylan your trending!!! I’m so proud of you, you bamboo stick!!!
Please react to the power rangers movie 2017
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
DYLAN'S ON TRENDING!
I found his old vids and now seeing him I’m disappointed that he looks like lil huddy
Yea, I like this new series idea!
Okay I know what Dylan says about requesting stuff but this is more of just an idea. I loved when he watched Stranger Things, so I thought it would be great for him to watch Umbrella Academy, also it's like my favorite show lol😊
I really recommend the Bridget Jones series for your movie commentaries!
Black is king reaction pls
There's a song by a german raper that's basically the plot of bad match and that song came out 2014...
Yes. Please do more.
#18 ON TRENDING WOOOOOOO
Keeping Up With The Joneses is essentially “Date Night” with Tina Fey and Steve Carrell
Try doing this with YouTube channels...some of them are straight up scammers.
Not sure the pituitary gland is in the penis... Plus that doctor clearly said "brain tumor."
Well.. you broke your own rules on the first video.. watching a newer movie with no score yet. That's a fail and a misdirect. But that Late Bloomer thingy sounds interesting.
Dylan is #18 on Trending 😍😍😍😍😍😍
#18!!!
YouTube said you’re trending!!!!!
I really like your sweater 😍
2017 trailers for the next one and then 2018 and then 2019 and then 2020 and then—
Definitely would love to see more of this. (and definitely did not laugh at the joke Dylan said was not funny in Work It. Nope.)
Keep doing this movie trailer series 😭
The first movie has the guy from knights tale??? Is that really him?
you should watch “the favourite”!!!! it’s a great movie
you NEED to watch and do a commentary euphoria!!!
The Starr life
can we trap liza koshy in youtube please if I see her anywhere else again I might cry
I hate rt how dare u give the secret life of Walter Mitty 51% and this junk 100%😭
Dylan: “He had a tumour in his penis ”  Me: no Dylan 😂😂 his brain
someone tell this man where the pituitary gland is
Dylan is TRENDING! The world finally knows him.
Dylan is on the trending page
Wait. The After We Collided trailer was right there and he didn’t click it? Dude, do you see the image????😂
I watched work it yesterday. It felt like watching nothing. I didn't care about any character. And I could imagine you commenting on it.
Work It was not actually that bad - a little cringe but u kinda know that going into it and it has some funny moments. sabrina and jordan were such a good match too!!
Just watched work it yesterday and actually enjoyed it, despite it being cliche
Yes more of this please!
Millennial aren't teenagers anymore, the youngest millennials are in their mid to late 20s 😅
Work it was a good movie. Jordan is a great dancer. His music is underrated.
I enjoyed this too much 😂😂😂 just found a new game lol
I have just one thing to say.... STEFAN IS THAT YOU?!! 😱 Wtf u doing there 😱😂 Also Dylan how did you not catch that, omg don’t tell me he hasn’t seen the series yet😱😱😱     Edit: ok thank god he caught it just didn’t comment on it for some reason😂
i feel like the "i hope you wouldn't have cried this time" line would have been more fun in the American pie esque trailer had he delivered it with more gusto - like make it a little 'i'm in a time loop and it's driving me a bit insane' like make this boring scene even a big dynamic mate
react to crazy rich asians!!!!
I actually watched bad match he ends up killing her
Dylan rolling his eyes and shaking his head whenever Liza Koshy is on screen is sending me.
I guessed 47% on the first one and I'm very proud of myself
Loved this concept 👏🏻
I actually watched late bloomer and loved it 😂😂😂 i like this kind of movies
i want the shirt he's wearing hhhh
oh please, if you were in his place and that car "barely tapped" you, you would've yeeted back to your old apartment Dylan 🤨
dylan is so beautiful it hurts
Dylan: why is he crying???  well you have to watch the movie to find out Dylan 😤
I want more of these
The tumor was in his brain
Dylan you're trending in Germany!!!
When u were this close🤏🤏 to watching the after we collided trailer
omg THIS IS TRENDING
I'm very offended that you didn't recognize Stefan Salvatore at 6:00
Wish your name was chad
do you not get copyright claim from that trailers
Trending, wow
I recommend to make this a series.
The last movie doesn’t work at all (from what we see in the trailer) because they don’t make us like the girl for long enough. In other films like this (Obsessed, The Perfect Man, Fatal Affair, The Intruder, Secret Obsession), they spend at least some of it making us like the scary character. It’s generally a bad sub genre of movie, but I’m sure this one takes the cake.
the youngest millennial is 25 or 26....teens aren't millennials. YOU are Dylan
The Vampire Diaries guy? 😂 Paul Wesley I’m sorry
"Bad Match..what's the plot here?" I mean it has 'thriller' in description so I'm guessing she's a psychopath 😂 Edit: heck yeah points for me
I watched bad match last night, I kinda liked it. It was so weird 😂
Why do I guess 37 EVERY TIME???
Can you please watch Bad Match
Great video 😎
Aren’t you bbno$?
Nobody:  Me : Waiting for After We Collided
Love this concept!
There are only two self defense moves you ever need to know in life: throat punch and *vagina chop*
Rotten tomatoes employs essentially: extreme feminists, anti-white campaigners and PC warriors to review movies, I wouldn’t ever put any credit to their ratings. Some of the funniest and most challenging movies to come out this decade are rated horribly by them, and vice versa.
The problem with Bad Match is the trailers. I saw a random review for it and then watched it and liked it. I thought it was pretty good. But the watching Dylan react to the trailer. Made me realize why pretty much no one was it bc the trailers made it look like shit
Can someone recommend all the obscure movies so that Dylan is forced to watch stuff we want?
He should react to Euphoria
do u think dylan knows teenagers aren’t millennials anymore? do u think he knows we’re gen z?
Really missed our hottie 😩🔥
Make this a series👏👏👏👏👏
What a beautiful sweater 😍😍
VAMPIRE DIRARIES GUYS IM DEAD😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂 ITS PAUL WESLEY
Im sure its beem said already but pretty much it did a commentary track to Bad Match
work it has 86% currently but no audience score lmao
I was here August 11, 2020 when this video was trending. 🙋🏽📈currently # 19
I think the pretty much it guys watched bad match. I don't think it was that bad, iirc.
Movie should be called "Bad Pair" instead of "Bad Match" lol, and yeah dylan you should do more of this
The fact that he said vagina chop with a straight face had me laughing till i almost peed.🤣🤣🤣
If someone has a knife they're still dangerous even if they're a woman 😂
Oh yeah... I was curious about this.  If you're a girl like. If you're a boy comment.  Coz im legitimately curious. I dunno why.
Can u react to the movie “how to train your dragon”??
Millenials are in their 30s now
How tf did he not go through puberty but his voice broke
Me realizing that I don't have a life because I already watched all of these shit movies T_T
why have I watched all of these trailers
the fact that i genuinely enjoyed keeping up with the joneses and saw it twice worries me now im insecure
pls watch work it 😳👉🏼👈🏼 maybe....pls
I dunno what to comment except this is really cool dylan, you should try more of this and can't wait when you figure out a late night dylan.  Love youu💙🖤
For those of you who are new, Don’t ever recommend something to Dylan because then he will make sure to go out of his way of not watching it. DONT DO IT
I don’t wanna be that guy but I never trust RT’s ratings. This is proof why. Bad match is an awful movie, Keeping Up W/ The Jones’ on the other hand is *chefs kiss*
You should watch the trailer for ‘do not reply’, I got it recommended to me yesterday
why have i already seen the late bloomer
Am I the only one who saw the After We Collided trailer and was dying to get Dylan’s reaction???
I definitely never heard about one of these and I'm not even sure if all of them made it to Germany 😅  But I already love this new series.  Ps: was anyone else really bad with the guessing or was it just me? 😂
Dylan: he just throws himself on her me who's seen the movie: well,,,,,
I literally said 15% for the last one too 100 is nope no way
Dylan I feel pretty called out and offended considering I’ve seen premature, keeping up with the Jones’s, and the late bloomer. Even tho I forgot I’ve even seen those movies.
I LOVE THIS STYLE OF VIDEO! Yessssss more like this!
this series is such a cool idea :D
100% what the heck
It's not people who doesn't heard of these movie, it's you .
Yes please do this again!
I love how the last movie had a 100% critics score right after I told my friend 'this movie... just oozes out misogyny somehow', because of course it would have a high critics score then, lmfao
You should make this into a series man it's entertaining as fuck
Jokes on you I’m a lesbian and do, in fact, pray to Beyoncé
i cant believe it dylan's trending OMG MY DUDES GOING PLACES LOL
I’ve been here for awhile man and I can’t believe how big you’ve got! You’re in trending! That’s amazing and I’m so proud!
'Work it' almost makes me want to cancel my netflix subscription
Seeing that Bad Match got 100% was scarier than the actual trailer tbh
Out of all the movie trailer you watch I have only seen keeping up with the jones
you should watch the worst and the best in this list
Please review big hero 6! My daughter and I love your channel 😃
Love it, do more please!
Even Dylan gets stuck in the youtube bad trailers rabbit hole sometimes 😂
i think you need to watch that last one if its got 100%
I actually knew some of these trailers - from hours of trailerbinging
Hamilton please
0:07 Like a villain?
Honestly bad match is an interesting watch. Not worth the 100 percent it got, but I would enjoy seeing u watch it.
*Those who are reading this, I wish that you will live a healthy life with your family❤❤*
This was fun to watch. I enjoyed it
I loved Work it. Please do another
next video , watch horror movie trailers
My boi is finally trending in Canada
Pituitary gland is in the brain not the penis 🤣🤣🤣
React to WAP by Cardi b ft Megan thee stallion 👑
6:46 yup so me when I see actors that I know in the same movie.
Is it bad that I’ve seen all these...
19 on trending :D
Dylan: "This was like, I think, a 2014, like a very raunchy movie..." Title: "2016"
the late bloomer looks like it was supposed to be an off brand Judd Apatow comedy that got hit with the “let’s release this the third week of August” treatment
This is such a unique idea! I'd love it if you kept making videos like this !
Dude you should review a teenage mutant ninja turtles movie
"I don't want 40 year old writers writing for teenagers" Same bro same
You should watch Jumanji
I feel like there aren't good movies anymore
Ok but like you’re 19th on trending!!! So proud. We’ve come so far!!!
Pls watch Charlie's Angels 2019
for a second i thought it was bloodstain on your shirt
PLS REACT TO AFTER WE COLLIDED WHEN IT COMES OUT😭😭
Trending?
PLEASE TURN INTO A SERIES
Dylan only watches movies or movie trailers that YouTube recommends sorry fans you miss out haha
The trailer for Bad March is terrible, but the movie itself isn’t bad. Sure it’s not groundbreaking, but it’s a decent thriller with a cast that serves the purpose and hell, it kept me invested
Actually I've heard of most of them. Back in 2016 this was about the only thing I watched on YouTube...
premature could and very may well be the _worst_ movie ever but i’m glad my loves, carlson young and john karna from mtv scream got their bag
0:57 I kinda wish he watched the After We Collided trailer. That made me cringe SO HARD and it's not even the movie yet.
saw "Keeping Up with the Joneses" 1.5 years ago 5/10 but now I think that it is not that bad
React to work it on Netflix
I still miss the highly highly editted videos you did like for Fallen that was prime and funny as fuck. But I def understand they are infrequent for a reason and we love all your videos dylan
It’s sad that I’ve watched all of these movies lol
I watched Bad Match after PMI did and I actually really liked it!!! It had a really interesting twist where the morals start to get fuzzy
YOURE TRENDING!!! OH MY GOSH YOU DID IT!! you’re getting the love you DESERVE!!
Can I just say, I basically knew the entire cast of Late Bloomer but have never heard of the film.
Premature is actually not that bad. John Karna and Carlson Young are great actors
movie reviews is not always on point
Wtf Dylan you’re at on the trending list
I know you hate recommendations but you should try watching a 1950s movie like a marlin Monroe like umm oh yeah ’some like it hot’.!
I watched bad match after randomly finding it on Netflix. It was...okay. Kinda weird but in an off way character wise. They just weren’t developed enough for me and frankly the movie felt too unoriginal
This was a sick idea
I think it would really add to it if you read some of the reviews.
I saw After We Collided😏
More chill zone please
Please do another video like this!
YOU DESERVED THE WHOLE TRENDING THINH BABY
The late bloomer was good because Paul Wesley was in like 7 minutes of it
premature was genuinely such a funny movie to me it was so dumb 😩😔
Dylan the pituitary gland is not located in the penis...
This is kinda dope I LOVE IT
DYLAN UR TRENDING KING
Yes, please do this again!
I love this.... definitely make it a series
Love this idé. 🙂 💕
I've been watching your channel for a year or so. Very awesome to see you trending!! ❤️
I just watched 90% of the late bloomer trailer without realising I've seen it before...
I thought Keeping up with the Joneses actually really good!! I loved the cast!
Pls react to "perks of being a wallflower"
Nobody:  Only Dylan ever: *Welcome to the chill zone, this is where we chill, that’s some chill lighting, chill vibes. We’re just chillin’*
I like this type of video it’s never been done
Did he just say the tumor in his pituitary was a tumor in his penis? 😅😂 the pituitary is a part of the brain😂😂
No wait excuse me what, are we not going to look into that 100%??
Man... I wish I could watch this  but there's no closed captions...
I said 10% on the last movie
Work it is on the top trending Netflix list. It looks to be absolute complete garbage. No comment either, the trailer alone was putting me to sleep😶
Tumour in his PITUITARY. It's a gland in the brain. It's gotta secrete certain  hormones for you to go through puberty
I like this series idea. It was chill and fun to watch on my nightly YouTube binge. I would really enjoy watching more videos like this!
How the heck did the last movie had 100% 😂😂😂 I was betting on 15-19%
Dylan is "that's not funny" in Trouble
Yo, I like this video idea, it's really fun 👌🏾
“Vampire diaries guy” AHAH DYLAN
when Dylan is number 28on trending!!!!
Love the video and would love to see more of it 👍
I’m so obsessed with your videos, I wish there was even more 😭
yeah hell yeah I vote for another this was fun
the last one just looks like an Editing Is Everything video.
The pituitary gland is not in the penis 😭
“Bad match” she’s a nut job bc she turned off a phone alarm when she was probably half asleep. 🙃
Whats funny about bad match is that it portray her as crazy but he ended up becoming obsessive to only learn she wasn't the reason why he lost his job. I forgot I saw this movie.
Me: ...  Dyan: "eWW"  Me: THE LORD HATH SPOKEN!!!
Not Dylan thinking millennials are teenagers lmao
tbh work it is really good imo
work it is amazing i promise lol like it’s one of the better netflix movies
when dylan’s vid is 23rd on trending!!!! woohoo congrats!💗🥳
Commenting to comment
but like, suuuurly do an It chapter 2 commentary
#23 on trending baby ✊🏾😭😭
I lost it when Paul Wesley appeared.
You know what? You can't completely trust Rotten Tomatoes. There are many reasons for this. They gave 100% rotten tomatoes for BAD MATCH ... WHILE THEY GAVE THE MOVIE JOKER 68% !?!?!?!?!?!?! What the...?
Currently #23 on trending 👍
This sweater genuinely scared the shit out of me.
TRENDING PAGE YES DYLAN
okay, but dylan brought the toodles back!!! ive been waiting for him to start saying it again :)
I literally change the color of the lights in my room to match the lamps when I watch these videos... PURE JOY. I look forward to every single video on this channel.
You should watch these movies for a video or at least just the last one coz seeing that 100% was a major plot twist oh my god
Bad Match could just have a horrible trailer that downgrades the movie, like Clue does
HEY TROUBLEMAKERS lets recommend trailers for him to watch
Who else is just scrolling through YouTube bored af
y’all dylan is on trending 🥳
You’re trending on YouTube yayyy🥳🥳
That last movie was kinda good bad acting lol but I liked the plot
you do be trending :))
THE “eewww” SENTTTTT
Actually I have heard and watched "Bad Match", not one of my proudest moments I must admit. But the trailer is super deceiving and since I am almost 100% sure that you are not going to watch it let me just tell you how it actually plays out. First of all you have the main guy who is portrayed as rich, smart and successful "who would have thought". He's trying to get this big project/promotion at work obviously. Meets this random girl online and hooks up. All these bad things start happening to him and he blames the girl then accuses her of being obsessed with him, very narcissistic in my opinion. He thinks she's out to ruin his life because he's not in love with her. He confronts her and naturally she has no idea what he's talking about. So he then decides to stalk her to trick her into confessing to clear his name because apparently that's what normal people do I guess. He ends up catfishing her into an abandoned building and ties her up. She finally confesses so that he let's her go but of course she ends up attacking him. Self defense completely understandable but that's just me. He struggles way too much fighting this random chick and literally ends up killing her. Just to get a call from either his lawyer or friend honestly I don't remember. Turns out he's an avid gamer and some random kid who lives who knows how many miles away was so pissed that the main guy kept killing him in let's just say COD, that he hacked his computer and put all that child porn on it. It was the kid out to get him this whole time the girl was actually innocent and he's now a murderer. I just thought it was so dumb how the trailer forces this completely different movie and when you actually see it it so different. It's even more upsetting because the trailer isn't even good either. I give it 5 rotten tomato's out of 100.
Enjoyed this new video series!
not dylan thinking the pineal gland was in the penis- 😔
OH MY GOD I FORGOT ABOUT PREMATURE I WATCHED IT FOREVER AGO AND IT WAS SO DUMB LMAO
awesome idea. do horror trailers please ! :P
Yes!! More of these videos!
Pls pls pls watch were the Millers it's so good
The most scary part of that last movie is that the rotten tomatoes is 100%
Me: laughs  Dylan: that’s just not funny  Me: ya, stupid movie that’s not funny
OMG Dylan in on the trending! !
Bro you turned old quick
Now that you saw movie traileria from 2016 you should do older ones for example 2013 😅
Paul Wesley.... I didn't expect that. Lol
I have watched all three 2016 movies, I am embarrassed lol
Now Dylan gotta watch all the movies of these Trailers.
am i the only one who has seen these movies ?? lol i've seen 3/5
ayy Dylan got a video on trending!!!!
DO NOT RECOMMEND. I REPEAT. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!
you now have to watch bad match, see why it got 100%.
JK SImmons won an Oscar, how dare you call him C List!? That actress in Bad Match is in a LOT of tv series - Gotham, Westworld, Ray Donovan ...
WATCH HUSTLERS!!!
You're 25 ON TRENDING I LITERALLY CAN'T BELIEVE IT
work it is actually really good
i remember the pretty much it guys did bad match and yes it sucks
couldn't find the riverdale commentary series!!
Not gonna lie I have seen 4 of the 5 movies
Bring on the movie trailers. I can't wait to see the trailers that show up on your recommended after watching these 🤣
Work It was super cringey but still enjoyable in a mindless way. If nothing else but just to see Jordan Fisher dance and be charming.
8:47 omg i just saw that and it was amazing! i love liza, jordan, sabrina and drew 💖💖💖
Maybe Im a sucker for Zach but I actually like keeping up with the Joneses
Work It is actually good
5:59 paul wesly!
Look at you on trending
this video was rlly good, would love to see more in the future with this same ranking movies type thing :)
Me sees bad match trailer  My brain: *pretty much it*
Where’d you get your shirt from?  It’s pretty dope.
Dyaln noooo keeping up with the joneses would be your fave movie! lesbian kiss and action, wtf
I dont know why, and of course there are exceptions, but movie reviewers are so much more trustworthy than videogame reviewers, why is that?
DO THIS AGAIN DO THIS AGAIN DO THIS AGAIN
I like this, chill zone, specifically the purple lighting and ombre sweater.
Yall when he clicked on the first movie I saw the after we collided character
vampires diaries guy 💀that’s paul wesley
Bruh I kinda feel bad ur whole yt page is going to be flooded with movie trailers now 😂
Bad Match is just a bad yandere movie lmao
Dylan: **gets on trending**  Me: 💫🌟✨ *y a y* ✨🌟💫
Dylan my power has been out for HOURS, THANK YOU for helping me in these troubling times 😂
11:18 anybody else lose sound?
"he had a tumor in his penis" boi the doctor said pituitary. LMAOOOO
D
Work it was actually not that bad lol
Doesn’t know who beck Bennett js
PLEASE DO VAMPIRE DIARES
Some trailers sucks big ass man
I actually don’t mind Keeping Up with the Joneses. Sure, it’s not a great movie, but it has enough funny moments to be an okay movie.
This video is on the trending page!
Bad match was like another movie I’ve watched that was a horror movie but it was actually good
Meh, I only watched work i for Liza. Honestly I guessed the entire damn plot from the trailer. But who cares. I went in for the cringe.
“Keeping Up With The Joneses” surprised me because I’ve seen that movie and it’s actually a pretty okay movie
He reminds me of Doctor Mike
ok but work it was actually really good, especially the ending dance scene. the trailer didnt do it justice
OMG DYLAN YOU'RE 23 ON TRENDING AAAAAAAH
You need an onlyfans 😜
*WATCH LOVE, ROSIE OR THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER YOU WILL LOVE THEM BOTH*
okay who rigged the tomatometer for the last movie
Omg he’s trending I’m so proud of him😍❤️❤️
Dylan ur trending 🤪
Work it is actually good
I will say this I almost didn't watch Work It because of the trailer.
ok but i actually watched “keeping up with the joneses” and at the time, i thought it was funny. at least i think it was... i don’t even remember, i just know they were spies and they blew up their own house.
Your on trending!!
he KNOWS THE VAMPIRE DIARIES
I'm here to inform you that the pituitary gland is in fact attached to your brain, not your penis, and that you should not trust Dylan for any medical advice
PMI kinda loved bad match so i get it
Work it is pretty good
I would watch The Late Bloomer just for the cast 👌🏾
You be clickbaiting though
Pls do a reaction vid for Work It
This is in NO WAY a recommendation!!!! Did you know that your boy cam is in the movie burlesque.
You seriously need to watch Sleepover with Alexa Vega.
You should do a commentary of “The umbrella academy” 👀✨ You’re gonna love it
I know you don't like recommendation but could you please please just watch... five movie trailers and guess the tomatometer for the movies. I'll never recommend anything again. Promise.
You should watch “upside down magic” and “danger force”
😘💙
Its gonna sound weird but the tumor on the pituitary gland fucking puberty is not just a gag, its a real thing and its scary.  My boyfriend had one and all his hormones are messed up.
Ok, but actually watch the full Bad Match movie. I think it used to be free on youtube. The end tho....
Dylan is trending and now I feel like a proud Momma Goose
trending????
Do it again And maybe like choose a bad ond and watch the whole movie
What the hell you mean "vampire diaries guy" hello thats Paul Wesley
I really like this new idea Dylan!
Critic score: 100% What No. Of Critics: 8 Ah
ok, but how bad is it that I actually liked keeping up with the joneses
He picked like the worst movies haha
this was a cool video concept! totally dug it
YES more!!!!
Trending in Canada!
dylan is #26 trending i-
Like it
#24 on trending
Yaaas more in this series!
sabrina carpenter is so talented why does she keep getting thrown into bad netflix movies
Didn’t he already comment on a movie that was similar to Bad Match, or am I tripping?
i was hoping he'd do a movie commentary of the movie Work It, then he watched the trailer in this vid :)
#24 on trending? ouo
The Tumor was in his brain not his penis... Pituitary Gland: The major endocrine(hormone) gland. A pea-sized body attached to the base of the brain, the pituitary is important in controlling growth and development and the functioning of the other endocrine glands.
"We average one sexual thought every 7 seconds" My sex repulsed asexual ass: um.... no❤
I got scared when the first movie "got" a 92% 😂😂😂... And I thought the same thing happened to the last movie!!!  Yes! Keep doing this videos, it was really funny
Please make this into a series!!
23 on trending now 🥳
#23 on Trending omggggggggg we have reachedddd a peak 🥰 love ya dyl 💛 always have you caught up on GOH because episode sixxxxxx ‼️😩
Making the trending list! Awesome super happy for that
I've watched the late bloomer and it was pretty good
Yes! Please do more!
the more the character gets hurt or dies the funnier Dylan thinks it is lol
Wait... Dylan is trending right now... I never thought I'd see the day!
me, a relatively “veteran” subscriber: there is no way anybody would still be recommending things in the comments the comments: hey you should watch uhhhh
Research 30 years old virgin. It's bad
Work It is actually a good movie!
#23 on Trending... OKAY DYLANNNN
are you gonna do a watch thru review thing for work it? like you did for the kissing booth ones?
soo we’re just gonna accept that last rating... ?
I watched Work It. It wasn't bad, but yeah it was cringe in a lot of ways. And the dancing wasn't good, except for the male love interest he was good
these feel like trailers randomly generated by a computer bot who has only watched Noah centineo movies
Does Dylan not know what a thriller is. Also, you can’t “continue with your day” if you’re accused of possession of cp
i've seen all five of these movies....not exactly sure what that says about me :/
I was so shocked when I saw paul wesley
"tumor in his penis" XD it was the pituitary gland
Premature has the girl and guy from the TV series Scream, which they're much better in.
Play mk11 dude do. Video n playing a game
Loved this. When he said who has even heard of these I can to laugh cause I have watched 3 of them before now.
I've seen the late bloomer
dylan would really enjoy "Us" also Umbrella Academy
i saw the jonses movie--it was just okay to me(zach was funny) but i was a teen, expected it to get higher tbh bc it just seems like somethin older ppl woulda liked but ig not lmaoo
The late bloomer ain't bad.
DYLAN’S ON THE TRENDING PAGE!!!!
I’m genuinely shocked that Dylan isn’t at one million yet. He’s legitimately one of the funniest people I’m subscribed to! Love ya, Dylan. Keep it up!
Is it wired that now I want to watch all this terrible movies?! 😂😂😂
millenials are not teens any more :(
I'm loving this new series ❤❤❤
I vote for Dylan to continue this series.
Woah this is trending in Australia, go Dylan
After we collided was right there!! I wanted him to react to it so badly!!
Did it make anyone else upset that he didn’t point out Liza Koshy who is also a pretty huge YouTuber but he mentioned that other one?
10 seconds in and I can't believe he didn't say that he was just Dylan chillin' or even welcome to chillin' with dylan', disappointment is THROUGH the roof
I actually really enjoyed Keeping Up With the Joneses
*#27 trending? period dylannnnn*
"a tumour in his penis" yes dylan.. thats exactly where the pituitary gland is
I feel like Dylan might hit 1 million subs before the year ends.
He’s got a brain tumor next to his pituitary gland —>  Dylan: “so he’s got a tumor in his penis”
Despite casting Amber Heard, I wonder if Dylan would be willing to watch The Joneses (2009).
I love this series!
I regret to inform you that I have seen “the late bloomer”
U should watch the trailer and try to guess the plot and the ending....kkkk
dylan on trending? yes pls
I’ve seen all these trailers but haven’t watched any of the movies 😂
Dylan's hot
Don’t you hate it when a trailer is so freaking good and the movie is just.. . disappointment
oh dude sick! you should watch  #1 "Don't recommend anything"  #2 "he told us not to"  #3 "let him watch random stuff"     #4 "Have a nice day"
Not Dylan on trending 😇😇😇
Dylan please do this video again it was really good
I really love this concept!✨🤍  Also, not sure if it was intentional or not, but him stopping right before the new After trailer literally put me in tears 😂 [laughs in British]🤣
Chappelle’s recent special literally got a 0% after the first reviews from the critics. It’s not reliable.
At the Joneses one I said 55 like half a second before you did...like...are we meant to be or what?
JK Simmons has an Oscar. That is NOT C List.
Holy shit, I’ve seen “Keeping up with the Jones.” I thought it was a fever dream
I know you dont take recommendations but... Aquamarine is pretty great
the guy who asked why the other guy was dressed like ellen in the first trailer actually looked like ellen a lil
Your trending in Canada Dylan!!❤️❤️
Work It isnt nearly as cringey as the trailer made it out to be. I originally watched it for Sabrina and Jordan but ended up enjoying myself
i would totally love this as a new series!! it was a funny and entertaining video to watch!!
Loved this video. Absolutely ready for more.
I seen Bad Match, its actually really good and the ending is a huge plot twist.
I love how Dylan names all the celebrities in the second trailer and then when Paul Wesley shows up he's just crickets
Can we also have horror short films reactions? Someday??
Dylan gives me a peace of mind lol
Do a movie review for Dating Amber, it's an Irish movie but it's only available in Amazon prime... Give it a shot, it's very good!!
Yo, Dylan is on trending
An actual good youtuber on trending does put a smile on my face
"Pardon the interruption but do you drive a *SILVER PRIUS*!" LOVE Jane Lynch
Okay but how tf does Bad Match get 100%????
You need to watch AWC! Remember your Reaction video to After? 😂😂
Dude you like masked intruder movies...hush is the movie for you it's on Netflix...watch the trailer man its probably one of the best intruder movies I've ever watched. But obviously this isn't a a recommendation since you dont like that lol
Teenagers are gen z. But your point still stands
Lol y have I seen all these movies 😂
I think IMDB has a more accurate rating than Rotten Tomatoes but I do like comparing the critic and audience scores - Especially when there is a big discrepancy.  Hope Dylan does another one of these.  Fun game idea for movie lovers.
Movie: we found a brain tumour up against your pituitary gland Dylan: oh my god he had a tumour in his penis
I got a barbie ad on this video and I think you should really watch some barbie movies. I unironicaly really love some of the older ones because I wasnt allowed to watch them while I was younger. And I know we shouldn´t recommend movies but I feel like nobody would ever recommend those. Btw Princess academie is my favorite one. I peopably watched that like five times
Can someone explain "Bad Match"...  I literally could have sworn that I seen this EXACT movie... but a different cast and a crazy ending...
DYLAN!!! You’re on trending!!!!
Reacting edits it would be awesome
God, just me that wants to watch Dylan reacting to edits of Instagram?
It’s the fact that Dylan thinks the pituitary gland is in the pe**s for me 😭😭🤣
847 868 0110
Bad match was good, it had the best plot twist
I need Dylan to do a movie commentary for Girls Trip (2017). I neeeeed it.
Again using my favorite color on the lights!! I adore this man! ❤️
You must watch the vampire diaries in yous channel is epic 😍
dude this is actually a really good youtube challenge idea for movie review channels
You are just so cute! That toodles at the end lol
I saw keeping up with the joneses it was bad but the script was really corny sometimes. They did have some bad ass fighting scenes though(in between dumbass joke)
I just saw Stefan from vampire diaries talk to weirdo bf from Jennifer’s body & don’t know how to react or live with that information
me patiently waiting for Dylan to get 1 million subscribers😃.
Work It was a good movie
I saw an After 2 trailer listed....no...who decided that movie deserved a sequel??
As of rn, Work It has 83% on RT. I watched it too lol, it's honestly better than both Kissing Booth Movies so that should count for something. Also Liza was surprisingly decent in it.
Cool sweater, where do U get it from?
Hey Dylan just a suggestion, im not sure if you already know. You can add videos to a queue by putting your mouse over the thumbnail and pressing the second black square with three lines. This just makes it easier so you don't have to open in a new tab
Dylan have u watched HAMILTON???????
i remember the late bloomer coming out but i never saw it.
we've all gone down the "watching bad movie trailers" spiral
Honestly “Work It” is probably the only movie that I can sit through and watch and not be hating every single character like the Kissing Booth or every other RomCom by Netflix.
lol just realized ive seen most of these (side note not saying I enjoyed them hahaha)
ahh i love when you go into film teacher mode it reminds me I'm not the only nerd
you should watch work it! it has its cringey moments but a lot better than the kissing booth
just letting everyone know that work it movie has an 80% rating what even
Are they supposed to be in high school or college? Because Liza looks 30 and Jordan looks his age and Sabrina still looks 14
On trending! So proud of our daddy!!!
Wait am I the only one who saw STEFAN SALVATORE at 5:59 cause NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT ? Go back to Mystic Falls Stefan and try not to die this time :)
throat punch or vagina chop. damn what are those options. 😂
Credits to another commenter called A. Wurld O. Darknuss (they came up with chillin' with Dylan)  Who else thinks Dylan should make a series called Chillin' with Dylan where he just talks, watches trailers, recommends movies and shows, basically just chilling with us? any other suggestion just reply and I'll add it :)
since he did IT chapter 1 he should definitely do IT chapter two I think he would love Richie and eddies characters and them being a comedic duo 😂 But whateverrr
Wow it’s trending..... congrats!
I really liked this video you should definitely do another🙂
<3
Change the name to "Chillin' with Dylan"
oh my god please watch the first time it’s such a good ya romcom
Good video idea, Dylan. It was fun!
lol i’ve seen all these movies. but i have a thing for cringed movies. so yknow
Honestly so proud of Dylan, I still thought he was a small channel then I look and he’s almost at a million subs and he’s trending!! Big bet hun
pls watch ‘ work it’ 🥺
The ending of Bad Match made the movie a whole lot better btw
this is SUCH a good video idea
Omg you're on trending
why you didn´t watch MARY SHELLEY!!  I sob inside
Hola quisiera compartir este mensaje importante contigo, hace 2000 años aproximadamente, nacio un niño y su nombre fue Jesus,  fue el enviado de Dios para limpiar el pecado de este mundo,  para que todo el que crea en su nombre no sea condenado por los pecados que ha cometido a lo largo de toda su vida, cualquiera que se arrepienta de sus pecados y crea que Jesus murio en esa cruz sera SALVO y no sera condenado el dia del JUICIO DE DIOS, que viene contra todos los que no creen en su nombre. EL TIEMPO SE ACABA:El Señor Jesus en el Evangelio segun Mateo en el capitulo 24 da las siguientes señales de los ultimos tiempos:"Oires de guerras y rumores de guerra" "Porque se levantara nacion contra nacion y reino contra reino, habra pestes, hambres y terremotos en diferentes lugares" Amigo o amiga el Señor viene pronto y vendra por su amada iglesia, por los que en El creyeron. "El que tiene oídos para oír, oiga"....
You should watch the trailer to starwars
dylan... ur #28 on trending??
Me seeing stefan salvatore in the second trailer like 👁👄👁
please react to work it i BEG
Dylan is trending!!!! Proud fan😌
watch flower (2017) zoey deutch that was fucked up
Can you do this again, disney channel movie style?
I liked We’re the Joneses, it would probably make for a good commentary video. I’m surprised it scored so low!
Bad Match was actually a solid film with a great twist
This is actually a cool concept lmao
You should watch and react to Lucifer it’s soooo good but season 1 isn’t good but it gets soooooo much better season 4 is the best in my opinion and season 5 comes out august 21!
Oh my god your'e in trending!
Lol a few years ago I used to just watch movies trailers for fun so I've seen most of these before 😂😂
I got jumpscared by Work It. That was the worst movie I have seen since The Kissing Booth.
This concept is so fun, please make more videos like this!!
I watched Work It yesterday and the trailer made the writing seem MUCH worse then it actually is. I mean of course there are a few cringey parts but god that trailer did terrible bc I thought the script was actually decent and I enjoyed it. Though I do think that the dancing scenes didn't have the same awestruck effect they wanted to get (as compared to other dance movies I've seen that are similar) which is a shame bc the main cast are pretty good dancers. But other then that, pretty enjoyable movie. (and I mean sabrina carpenter and jordan fisher are hot so you got that)
It's funny coz I usually agree with Dylan's opinions on movies but I genuinely loved Work It, it was just very feel good lol
me having watched all of these trailers and some of these movies
The most compatable sign with a virgo is a capricorn. 0 stars for that movie.
10:37 Work It is actually a pretty good movie, but it is a little cringy lol 😂 If there were rotten tomatoes, I would guess it would be 67%
DYLAN ON THE TRENDING PAGE? WHAAAAT?
I was waiting for this yesterday i think Dylan uploaded this around 12 midnight in the Philippines. 😂😂😂
Yess Dylan is on trending!!
Dylan pretending he’s a Martial Arts master every time there’s a fight and then he comes out with “Vagina Jab!” is peak comedy
Millennials aren't teens anymore, Dylan. We're old now.
A shitty version of "you" the show
Haha I guess great minds think alike bc we made the exact same guesses on the percents of each of the movies! When I tell you I was shook each time!
yo the purple lamp is a beauty
Dylan: are we scared though? Me: hiding my eyes from the screen clutching my pillow. “No”
PLEASEEE DO MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS 😀 Love this series 😂
if the last one had the roles reversed it would be a real horror... but like, a little TOO real
I'm so happy that Dylan knew that Paul Wesley was from the vampire diaries
I'm excited to see where this series goes!!
cant recommend but can we ask for a type???? like animated movies???
TVD fans I know for a fact that yall got exited when you saw Paul Wesley haha
Me: *laughs at a dumb joke                                       Dylan: NOT FUNNY. TERRIBLE JOKE                         Me: not funny at all. Not even a smile
The fact that you’re trending makes me so happy
Bad Match actually wasn’t that bad of a movie
I fucking knew so many of these movies.... I'm questioning my taste in movies right now....
When you’ve actually watched all these movies:          👁👄👁
On 4:18 they were talking about masturbating then after that it said coming soon 😏 😂
what’s your favorite movie?
Oooh, a new favourite series
Dylan kinda reminds me of Klaus mixed with Ben from Umbrella Academy. A perfect blend of them both
IS THAT PAUL WESLEY!?
I semi remember the late bloomer movie lol and I was looking forward to Work It. I also found Keeping u with the joneses quirky but funny I'm dead at the vagina cho tho
please do more of these
Is that Brooke and Noah in the same movie?????
Now you have to watch Bad Match to see how it got 100%
all of the trailers have the same background music
Idk why But I want Dylan to react Hamilton
Has he seen hush on netflix? If not, he should do a reaction of it.
I guessed the same as you for with KUWTJ, I’m surprised yet not at the same time. It just felt so dry, I actually tried to watch this movie. I just think suburban spy movies are so overdone and no one wants to see a “normal family” when they want to watch a movie. The last one seems like a bad Lifetime movie mixed with a student film lol I’m so confused on what they’re trying to do genre-wise. Those ratings are fucked up... that’s why I don’t take Rotten Tomatoes seriously.
Do these more often, they are very entertaining
React to work it
i watched keeping up with the joneses in theaters 😳
i kinda wanna see you do an investigation on rotten tomatoes to figure out how the hell that "horror" movie got 100%
Can you do "Bohemian Rhapsody" next
I thought it would be 10% .. probably hit 0 twice when submitting that rating baha!! its definitely 10%
u should watch the After We Collided trailer and just say if u are going to watch the movie or not 🤪
I feel like "bad match" sounded like a good for men who are scared of women having rights and them being hol accountable.
When you see that Dylan posted so you get excited because now you have something to look forward to.
ayyyyy this is trending ....
I watched "Premature" a while ago. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY. I never even sawthe trailer. But DAMN thats a cool movie. Better than " To all the boys I loved before " and all those teen boring things.  Super fun,not american pie fun but weird,in a cool way. Not gonna recommendto THA DYLAN cause he will never watch it,but to everyone else reading...give it a chance.
I've seen late bloomer wasn't that bad but wouldn't watch it again
That last movie is actually pretty decent. Definitely not a 100% (not even close) but the trailer is just a mess. Spoiler?: he thinks the girl is ruining his life so he locks her in a warehouse in order to kill her. It turned out she wasn't doing anything and it was a guy with whom he had a fight earlier in the movie. I think some of the scenes in the trailer were nightmares.
man we need more beer and a movie videos :(
"That's not funny" Me after he said that:😂😂😂
*Dylan hating on everybody but Zach Galifianakis for 17 minutes straight*
the work it movie had like 92% or 82%. It is actually a good movie
Yeahhh this was fun you should do more like this- as long as you enjoy it too- actually idk I like all your content 😂🤦🏼‍♀️
Dylan should make part two of these never heard of movie trailers
When you realize it's #28 on trending
NO FREAKING WAY THIS VIDEO IS ACTUALLY TRENDING RIGHT NOW!!!! I'm so happy for Dylan :D
somehow i just knew that netflix trailer was gonna be work it. maybe because i just love jordan fisher
lmao bad match. that's all i have to say.
why do I fell like Dylan is my friend?
This is a really fun style of video! Loved it
Plz make this a series Dylan 🥺🥺
the way all these trailers have come up in my recommended before and i've watched a few of them
Keeping up with the Jones's was Hilarious!
Bad Match is actually more twisty than you think and even as a thriller it doesn’t take itself too seriously.  Wouldn’t say it’s top tier but it’s a decent Saturday night stream with friends type movie
You really are living your best life with this channel just doing whatever comes to mind or makes you happy 😂 love your random ass content. Also, if you ever run out of content ideas (NOT A REQUEST DON’T COME FOR ME) you should start a Patreon and have the top tier be troublemaker requests, just sayin
Hey DylDyl ik you dont like recommendations BUT you should totally do a series where you watch the trailer first and then the actual movie to see how they match up!
Can't wait for the next one <3
Ok I know you don’t like suggestions.... but you should watch that movie and see  bc 100%??? Insanity 🤣🤣🤣
I was just watching this and my sister came in and said, "That looks like Orion". Orion is my older brother. Now that I think about it, they look almost identical.
hate to admit i've seen the first two movies on netflix...
Dylan :reads word ‘thriller’ in the title:  Also Dylan “I didn’t expect this to go horror...”
That dancing movie I believe is recreating that old movie from the late 90s where a white female ballerina decided to do hip hop dance. Only this time this move is geared towards today's youth.
i really enjoyed The Late Bloomer when i watched it lol
I think Dylan should watch movie trailers and pick the worst rated ones to watch lmao
A bad dating experience? Sir she framed him, stabbed him, broke into his home...what do you meeaan bad dating experience hahah
"audiences will eat trash they're rats" damn dylan lmao
I recommend you to watch Shrek 7
Watch happy feet
Loved this kinda of video 💛💛💛
How is nobody commenting 7:30????? The “ewwww” is so perfect😂
Squirrel friend is a drag race term you silly goose
Chillin with Dylan
Ayyy Dylan made it on trending 🥳 he deserves it so much 🥰
No. I have seen bad match and it was absolutely awful! There is no way it got 100%! You should definitely watch it until you hate yourself!!!
I need him to react to bad match now🤣
I was wonder what the actors from scream the tv series went. @2:12
The fact that people still call her Bay/Queen Bay in 2020... while simultaneously praying to her like a deity...
You should definitely make more videos like this one. I enjoyed watching and guessing their scores.
DYLAN IS TRENDING!😫💙 IM SO PROUD OF YOU
can you watch the lucifer season 5 trailer?
Premature was actually not that bad, but to be fair I do love trash
Ho my god I guessed right on the first one, no need to praise me
Holy shit this is on trending 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
this is my birthday present for tomorrow. thank you.
Virgos and pisces are not the most compatible. They should have atleast made  the statement accurate. The statement was in the bad match trailer btw.   Nvm. She turned out to be crazy. Probably said pisces are compatible with every zodiac sign she met.
i really like this video! specially because you really like talking about cinema, plots, camera angles and all of this things, so it's always cool to see you exercising (?) it  btw during movie commentary videos, when you start talking about these stuff and say "i'm going to stop talking about it because no one cares".... ignore that thought! its so cool to see you talking about those things, and make your videos so unique
CRAZY RICH ASIANS PLEASEEEE
I have never waited for any youtube subscribers vedio but Dam u i was waiting for your new vedio. U dammmmm funnnnnnnyyyyyyy.
I think I heard about "Bad match", there is a twist actually.
Hey Dylan, I really love watching your videos but I was wondering if you could add captions to your video. I live in a loud house so most of the time I can’t hear anything
I’ve actually seen the late bloomer, and I found it quite funny 😳😂
Tiktok isn’t meant to be Oscar-worthy Dylan, it’s just fun. Fun garbage.
Bad Match proves how crazy Pisces are
How is it such s weird cast? You were just expecting low budget casting.
soooo is he single? :)
I kno one of theses movies keeping up wth the.... I forgot
please do more of these vids
Honestly Work It was honestly not that bad 🤷‍♀️😅💁‍♀️
Yo this video is trending??
Omg my dance teacher is in work it!! 😆 like even if you don’t like it I’m so proud of her (she’s the gothic one)
I can’t believe Bad Match had a 100% I remember that movie from the pretty much it video
Wait did you just say “see you next time,   Squirrels” ??????
This video idea is really clever
Dude, Whiplash was also a feature film...
lol I've watched all of these . . . when I've got nothing better to do I just watch these random movie trailers 😂 half the time the ending is in the trailer
That was fun, would definitely watch if you do this again. So many bad movies out there
29 ON TRENDING!!!
Yaassss I want morrreee
Dude. Dig. The. Shirt.
Trending!! Happy for Dylan
Now you have to watch Bad Match I need to see why it’s 100%
He rly said "Vampire Diaries guy" 🤣
It would be awesome to have more of these videos. And I still don't understand the 100% for the last one 😂
bad match sounds like a movie that would just piss me off..
the concept of that last movie sounds terrifying, being framed like that is not the vibe
I screamed when I saw Stefan Salvatore(Paul Wesley)😂😂
Dude. Most people let fear get in their way. Common sense leaves.
Anyone else keep seeing the first time thumbnail and hoped he'd react to it, or just me and my Dylan O'brien obsession 😂
he is climbing up the trending list
He didn't have a tumour in his penis, it was in his pituitary gland which is located in the brain and releases sex hormones, responsible for puberty, etc
I wanna see you react to Glee now haha
New video idea: You have us vote which of these movies you have to watch for your next commentary video
I could only watch the "Work It" part between my fingers, it hurts
dylan you’re trending!!
Watch PMI’s commentary track for Bad Match, Dylan, then you’ll understand the score lol
Work it looks so dumb
I love your sweater!
That new netflix movie is just made a mess of an attempt at AAVE
this was so much fun!!! pls do it again!
He should have reacted to after we collided trailer
OMG WORK IT IS ACTUALLY SUCH A GOOD MOVIE THE TRAILER DOES N O T DO IT JUSTUCE
YES. YES YES YES. More of this content please 😂
You should see "Alias Grace". It's a mini sirie and its rate on rottentomatoes is 99%.
You have got to do more of these! This was awesome
I'm glad the puberty one was reviewed so poorly. That concept is so fucking stupid. Not only is it making fun of children when they're at they're most vulnerable, but trans people have to go through puberty (for a second time) at that age, and they don't act like children when they do.  . Also, Dylan, you should watch "This" . . . . **does a sick flip**
6:40 you should do a video about vampire diaries, like the one about chilling adventures of Sabrina. it would be great
I can’t watch movies normal anymore because now i imagine that Dylan will make a commentary over it and now all movies IF NOT PERFECTION are garbage lol
I love how Dylan was like "oh I might not do the toodles bit anymore" and then a couple months later he's back to doing it *_every single video_*
OH MY GISH I WATCHED WORK IT YESTERDAY QND I COMMENTED ON YOUR VIDEO THAT LIZA KOSHY IS IN A NEE MOVIE ON NETFLIX AND ITS SUPER STRANGE TO SEE HER IN THAT ROLE ANS NOW YOURE WATCHING THE TRAILER AHHHH
do horror ones next!!!
Finally new video
watch the movie unstoppable its about a runaway train
love this series already
Please react to Zodiac!
I’ve actually seen that weird puberty at 30 movie lmao
You’re on the trending page
AHHHHH YOUR ON THE TRENDING PAGEEEEE
Haha I've seen all these
am i the only one waiting for another beer and a movie lol
U should actually watch work it is really good
Do more pzl
that work it movie trailer is so cringe but i just finished watching it and it really wasn't that bad.............
dylan you can't mention hot summer nights and then not watch it
If Dylan doesn’t watch bad match, I’m gonna be sad
When you’ve already seen PMI cover Bad Match 👀
i literally did this myself last night when i saw that grown ups got a 10% score so i wanted to see what other movies were rated. turns out toy story got a 100% score
I don't know if I should be embarrassed or proud that I have watched every single movie you just showed
I guessed 39 on the Joneses 37 was the audience score!
I sadly watched the first two movies when I las 16, they were really bad😐
Ay what a great video idea
this man's said vagina chop
wait i've actually watched joneses movie lmao don't ask why idk either
good video dylan thank u
if you are wondering the tomato score of "Work It" (the movie with Liza Koshy) its 83%
Was that...was that Wash from Firefly in the first trailer??
Anyone else watched every single movie in this video?     I have a lot of free time
He needs to watch you get me, on Netflix
omg no the tumor wasn't in his penis it was brain tumor (he said against his pitutary gland)
"Vampire diaries guy"
Sorry but all I saw was after we collided
I like this new series idea!
please get a hair cut :(
after we collided’s trailer was just under this one😭😭
I'm surprised that Dylan didn't mention how "Bad Match"" is a rip off of "Fatal Attraction"
I think keeping up with the jonses is a good movie
It seems like Dylan is the sort of guy who would clown a man for being abused by a woman. Nice..
I rlly want to recommend a movie for u to commentate on Bc I know u would love it. But if I say it I know u won’t do it.
This was a good vid
*sighs* I've watched too many bad movies because I've seen most of these.
I love that he watched the work it trailer just so that he could do it with us awnn
Dylan make horror movie commentaries. And not like bad match horror
this is such a great video idea
Dylan that girl could shank you before you could even reach her lol. It's not always about physical strength
okay but why is dylan hot
You are vErY hAnDsOmE
Bad Match is one of my favorite movies but that trailer was horrible
I just watched “work it” I really liked it.
For the chill zone just go get the beer called chill while your chillin in the chill zone!!
at 12:36 he looks like you aggressive ex-boyfriend that is also a stalker.
Millennials are born between 1981 and 1996 so they are more likely the writers for these films, not the viewers.
You have to watch Work It I watched the movie and I really liked it I don't know if you would like it but you should give it a try on your next video
I know you said no recommendations, but just saying... Hush is about a masked intruder 😗😗😗 Not recommending tho
Can you react to “After We Collided” please 🥺🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hell yea do more of these please I ENJOYED THE SHET OUT OF IT
I’ve seen that bad match movie💀💀😅
Lol totally thought you did a review on Bad Match, now I think it was PMI who did it ;)  Enjoyed the video! "Vagina chop"
I watched Work It yesterday. It wasn't....terrible?
Ummm, I think what needs to happen is for you to do a movie reaction the Bad Match? 😂
The movie Bad Match is not all that it seems to be, it's got a pretty decent plot twist and it's much better then the trailer leads you to believe. Not 100% good but definitely a good step above 15.
The fact that I saw 4/5 of these movies...
Teenagers. Are not. Millenials.  Dear fucking God how old are you to not know that? "Oh yeah...people in the 90's...that makes them like 16 right?"
now he has to watch bad match cause it’s got 100% rating
6:03 what's Stefan doing here?
Me and my husband loved this 🤣🤣🤣always give us a laugh
What about TV show trailers. That's also a good idea
"Vampire Diaries guy" XDXDXD His name is Paul Wesley, but "Vampire Diaries guy" works too.
Im keen to see more movie trailer vids XD
This is a great new series. Would be awesome if we could vote on our favorite trailer from the episode and have a commentary video for that movie :)
I know that you don’t take recommendations but I NEED to say this!!   YOU NEED TO DO A REACTION TO THE VAMPIRE DIARIES!!!!
i had heard of the first two but I had actually watched premature like 2 or 3 years ago lmaoooo
Loving this idea ! Can’t wait for more
watch Teen Beach Movie
“Top or bottom” ur choice
I just want to say that I love your sweater. It goes well with the chill atmosphere.
YES WE NEED ANOTHER ONE
"Audience are rats, they will eat trash" wow this is so true, I mean just look at the marvel movies. Also why he keeps looking up idiotic rt scores makes no sense to me.
Watch bad match
Actually really enjoyed Mary Shelly
If you do this again I think you should do a all horror one
Will you watch Stranger Things 3? You watched season 1 and 2 so...
I watched Work It and actually really liked it despite the somewhat cringey writing. It helped that Sabrina Carpenter and Jordan Fisher have *excellent* chemistry
Would love for this to be a series!!
"He can overpower her tho"... idk can he?
0:07 chillin’ chillin’ with Dylan 😆( Descendants song ) 😜
I’m waiting for Dylan to watch After We Collided after seeing the first one lol 😂
Bad Match actually wasn’t that bad of a movie ngl it was pretty dope
wait how tf does dylan know paul wesley Imagine he used to watch tvd
I know we shouldn't recommend stuff but you already reacted to the trailer soooo.. Please watch work it, sometimes it was a little cringey but it's still sooo enjoyable!? And after tall girl you need to see sabrina carpenter in a good role
I actually really enjoyed Work It
honestly Mary Shelley made me cry way too much ahaha mostly out of anger
Omg now you have to watch Bad Match?!? Jk jk jk that wasn’t a recommendation 😬 But I did enjoy this format//video and I’d love more of these 🙂
Millennials aren’t teenagers anymore Dylan
honestly i didn't think work it was that bad lol
you should watch work it the cringe one with the horrible writing. it actually has some nice scenes like when she learns how to dance, as cliche as it is I think it was filmed nicely.
I watched bad match on prime a couple of days ago, it had a nice twist but i wouldn’t really call it a horror either
Chill vibes, I like it
Should be called confused zone because how did half of these actually get made
I like this new series haha keep doing it, last score really surprised me.
I actually enjoyed this video. You can do this monthly so we all can get our cringe dose every month from these trailers.
Dylan should text to EUPHORIA. He'll pause every scene to appreciate the cinematography and camera work.
Trailer: Tinder dating thriller Dylan: "what is the movie? Does he just get a bad date? (...) I didn't think this would go horror"
Love that shirt!!
love this idea!! maybe yyou can do it with trailers that kinda look good as well
I've watched every trailer that he watched and the ones on the recommended side before...  I'm very bored ig
Watch Hereditary If you Wanna be scared
Pretty Much It made a movie commentary on that last one
8:48 ow nooo im very disappointed With that movie although I didnt realy have high expectations , it's just that I hate to see sabrina n liza spare their talent like that 😩😩
100% while only having 8 reviews
I've seen Bad Match. It was decent actually lmao, but I wouldn't call it a thriller
the movie: he had a brain tumor pressing against his pituitary gland dylan: so basically, the plot of this movie is, he has a tumor in his penis
I love this please make it a series
Can we just talk about the fact the he called Paul Wesley “the vampire diaries guy” ... I can’t 🤣🤣🤣
yess do more of these! this was great!
Will you ever release merch because I would definitely buy it
The cast in Late Bloomer is amazing... I watched this movie about 3 years ago. I Didnt recognize any of the actors. Badger from Breaking Bad is the one that threw the basketball
please watch the half of it!!
Bish I need more of this
I actually saw Late Bloomer. It was awful
more of thissss👌🏽
Groundhog Day is amazing though
I have 2 things to say: 1. I recently watched one of the first videos you made in that apartment and it's amazing what you've done with the background, looks amazing every time you change the colors! You've come so far and we're so proud of you. 2. This needs to be a series, I had so much fun guessing the rotten tomatoes score, it was so sanitary! (Yeah, I'm still using that)   Greetings from Mexico!
Tumour on your pituitary   Dylan "TumOUr oN hiS peNIs"   I actually have seen that movie 😅
I know you hate recommendations but can you do palm springs
Critics will eat up just as much trash as the general audience. They just eat different trash.  BTW: Looking only at the percentages doesn't tell you much if you don't look at the score. It can have 100% and still only have like a 6/10 score.
Why not watch After Ever After 1 to 3 by Paint!
Keeping up with Dylan’s videos is the only commitment I’m not afraid to make
Omg is that Rio Wellard from Tracy Beaker in the first one
that statue is giving me anxiety
I watched Keeping up with the Joneses when it was on tv last year and it was ok. Not horrible but not amazing either.
I remember really liking the late bloomer but then again I think it could've been just me loving the actors
the %100 wtf sjsh
dylan tik tok really isnt that bad, you just have to get to the funny part and it wont take long. cmonnnnnnn
Me: loves Bad Match because my favorite actor is in it Dylan: what’s its score on rotten tomatoes? Me: jokingly screams 100 because I love this movie Dylan: 100!?!?!?!?! Me: 🙂
I’ve seen the late bloomer
Amazing idea! Would love more videos like this😍
Work it is generic but overall well executed and if you like dance movies it’s definetly good
React to the after we collided trailer dylan remember you watched the first movie after when you called hardin Chico lmaoaoao
I thinl the squirlfriend thingie was bc Rupaul says it ...and its a ‘quirky relatable’ film😂🤣 they are showing they are hip w the audience Dylan they know DragQueen slang ok! 😂😂😂
Dirty Sexy Saint passionflix
Keeping up with the Jones is the only movie i have watched from this list lmao, it was good but what do i know im apparently a rat who loves trash so.
the fact that ive seen half of these movies is embarrassing to me
I really liked this idea Dylan! Different from your usual, but still fun! Would love to see you do a series of these!
Yes do this again
i think ive practically watched all of his videos in the last couple weeks, and now my jokes literally even sound like him. I'm not even mad
Anyone else wants Dylan react to a Korean  drama? It would be legendary
Maybe it's not scary because is a woman? :/ Imagine if it was the opposite
I actually really liked Keeping Up With The Joneses lol I thought it was a pretty good movie
I literally do this all the freaking time!! I'd love to see more. Another idea would be to watch trailers for movies you've already seen and talk about if they matched the hype for the movie.
Ok, but real talk, keeping up with the joneses is a great film, but then again I find anything funny
I actually enjoyed Work It
I recommend the movie Recommend. It's a horror movie based off of Dylan's worst nightmare which is being recommended things to watch.
He needs to watch work it
Can you please watch normal people?? I never asked for anything 🥺
Work it was actually not that bad
oh god i watched this first movie akakksmsmmsd it's so weird
When I saw Paul Wesley and then he said the vampire diaries guy I died
I really liked this video Dylan! I'm hoping you continue this series cuz it seems like a lot of fun! Love your videos!!
Okay this is a brilliant idea.
you know you have to watch bad match now right
Dylan, are you chilling? Chillin like a villain? 🌝🌝🌝
You should watch bad match
For trailer 2 the tutor was in his brain
me: * reads the video title * me: lmfao this is gonna be great
Do this again, loved just chilling and kinda bonding with you in a way. Felt like we were watching together because neither of us had seen it before
How did you get “penis” from “pituitary gland”? 🤣😂
You should watch LOVELACE, it's an amazing movie
WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY !! That made me so happy 😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺
Anyone notice his mic cut off at 11:18 ?
Why have i watched most of these movies 😅
Could you watch Work it or Feel the beat? Also love your vid!
I was hoping he would watch work it! I guess this'll suffice! :D
I like this trailer series idea, but where is our anime series Dylan?
OMg I did this yesterday too, and apparently there's lots of movies we dont heard in the mainstream! Strange but True, We bring the Darkness, The Mandela Effect, what these come from?!?!?!?!?
Dylan see this!! Watch Sydney White
This video was such a great idea👏🏻
Millennials aren't teenagers. Dylan... you're a millennial.
Me waiting for him to click after 2 👁👄👁
Am I the only one who said “Dylan” right after he said “just chillin’” in the intro...
"40 year olds writing for what they think teenagers want " every cringy  Hollywood teen film EVER
Mamogram 😂😂😂😂
That Liza film looks absolutely horrible.
My first movie guess: 49% Actual score: 48%   Me: holy fuck
I've actually seen The Late Bloomer. That's all I have to say about that really.
I wanted to watch work it bc of keiyan lonsdale and jordan fisher (and I suppose sabrina carpenter I mean I listen to her music sometimes too) but I've never watched the trailer and now idk if I wanna watch it 💔
This is an awsome concept
Why do Zach Galifianakis looks like Mark Hamil?
You should watch literally any triller from reel one entertainment. It’s all hallmark-esq and terrible and all the trailers give away the entire plot of the movies
I hate movies like this but I am ashamed to admit I've seen it all except that Liza Koshy shit and the Bad Match
Getting cozy with my chips and frozen water...this should be fun :)
PLEASE do this again, this is so fun. Apparently I also guess the scores correctly lmao
Would you say your chillin’ like a villain Dylan...      I’m sorry I’ll show myself out 😂
This was fun
I was like why does Bad Match seem familiar and now I remember, I watched it twice
Now he HAS to watch Bad Match
i've heard of bad match bc of PMI and they really enjoyed it if i recall correctly haha
Please react to the Netflix series Sex Education.
lol watching this through a tornado in our families basement in my headphones.  get your coin. 💰
There can be bad movie trailers, and actually be ok to decent movies. I’ve see good movie trailers, but the movie ends up stupid or not as good as the trailer. So it can be hard to determine sometimes. But I have to say, you’re really good at figuring out the ratings. 👏👍
His defense moves and “vagina chop” was the best thing i saw today😭
Work it was really good tbh
99.9% of movies that have the word ‘bad’ in it are in fact bad movies
I really like that top Dylan is wearing
I literally gasped when i saw paul wesley in that one trailer
Is this what were talking about now
yay dylan!🥳
Work It is now #2 on Netflix so I assume it did alright on audience rating for rotten tomatoes
liza koshy and sabrina carpenter hyped up that movie so much for it to be That? 😐😐😐
Omg Paul wesley I'd probably watch that just for him😂😂
I know you told us not to recommend you anything but I just wanted to say your videos always make me smile and that you’re my favorite youtuber😂
Chillin'
Risky jokes Dylan you might get canceled by certain people 😂
The best groundhog like movie in my opinion is happy death day. It’s so funny 😂
No one: Absolutely no one:  Me: Isn’t that Noah and Brook from the show Scream? (It’s in the 1st trailer please confirm or deny, i’m so confused ;-;)
I can't watch most teen movies because I cringe too much. Middle-aged people write the script and think that's how gen z and younger millennials actually behave 🤭 I cannot-
YESSSS DO MORE!!!!! Loved this video
Me laughing Dylan: that's not funny Me: no it not 😀
bruh i actually watched bad match maybe like a year ago? but i completely blocked it out and forgot about, couldn't tell you WHAT possessed me to watch it.... but it was absolute ass
your theory that any guy could overpower a girl with a massive knife is a bit off
“VaMpiRe dIarIeS gUy”. ES PAUL WESLEY MY GUY😔
this video came just in time for when u just got yelled at by ur parents 🥰🙈🧚🏼💞😌✨💕🙊🌞 and need a distraction
Only me who sees Dylan o brien at the start and starts freaking out...no just me ok
I have seen all trailers accept netflix one, I used to be often be sucked inmovie trailer binge
I watched work it and it was pretty decent; however, like most Netflix movies it had a lot of moments that are just not realistic to real life.
I was looking at some reddit list of pet peeves and someone mentioned one that stuck with them and now I see it too. They said there was a show that first introduced the “you look like ____” trope and it’s completely overused now. At like 2 mins into this video the guy said “why are you dressed like Ellen DeGeneres” and.... yup. I hate it now too.  Anyone else know what I’m talking about?
Bad match reminds of the horribly slow murderer with the extremely inefficient weapon
We’ve moved into the Wattpad fan fiction era....  Me: uh.... I’m concerned for the human race now..
PAUL WESLEY
the only reason why i know keeping up with the joneses exists is because of gal gadot
Hey Dylan! I know you always say you don't want recommendations but you totally need to watch this           It's a misdirect
i recommend you do more of these lol jk jk jk jk but really liked this new segment i guess? in the dylan variety channel. Missed the mark by a lot in these, specially guessing the same as you for the last one.
You should look up trailers for the year you were born lol
pretty much it did a commentary on bad match, in my opinion the movie isn’t awful but it’s not good either. it’s one of those movies you’d watch when there’s nothing else available.
That's a fun format 😂
Just from the Work It trailer it sounds like a good til I hate myself movie — by the way I was closer to the last two ratings 😏
“ Vagina chop” I’m done ✅
Dylan, millennials are NOT teenagers! Millennials are in their 20s-30s right now. Teens now are Gen Z, I think.
"vagina punch" -Dylan 2020
I love this idea it was well executed!!!
Not recommending. But do more of these!
How. Does. One. GET DYLAN TO WATCH A MOVIE WITHOUT RECOMMENDATING IT.  Dear lord, how many "Dylan should be Flynn" comments do I have to leave on insta for him to trust me?
Do more of this, I very much enjoyed
Man, i know dylan doesn't take recommendations but i would love for him to react to hulu's palm springs. That movie so just.. *chef's kiss*
Brings up hot summer nights but doesn’t show his reaction, Dylan cmon man
You should do more tho
The late bloomer is actually an okay movie
I DO NOT GIVE TWO SHIYS ABOUT THE LIZA KOSHY MOVIE. Watch the joneses movie please
Imma recommend that u watch the movies you watch the trailers of
Pls pls react to the disney movie hercules if you haven't already pls I and a lot of other people would really enjoy it
me waiting for you to watch after we collided trailer like 👁👄👁
BRAIN TUMOR!! Not penis tumor!!
Please watch the movie "bolt" it's amazing and I love your videos
does dylan have a letterboxd?
The trailer makes work it look so bad an cringe but I swear the movie as a whole isn’t that bad I laughed like twice 😅
you know, every time you say troublemakers, my brain processes it as "treblemakers" and that's not really an association i want my brain to make.
I want him to react to After we collided the trailer or the movie I don’t care as long as he reacts to it but... “ I don’t take requests”
its my birthday 🥺🥳
I watched Keeping up with the Jones’s but it was kinda boring and was not that funny. Some jokes landed and others were cringe
Why do I want to lick your top?
hold on is wonder women a spy? and do you even have a sense of humour? ALSO weak people can win a fight over strong people they just need to be smarter
WATCH MOVIE PITCHES MEETINGS BY SCREEN RANT !!!!! i want to see you react to it.
Please please please please please please please please please watch the movie THIS MEANS WAR do a commentary on it please please
Please tell me you weren't serious with that "he could easily over power her" statement...they look to be in the same height and weight range...and your little block you did would just result in your hand being sliced or stabbed...don't judge someone weakness cause they're woman...just because your a tall bean pole of a man that towers over everyone
Work It wasn't that bad of a movie. It wasn't really good by any means, but I've seen way worse. The acting isn't horrible, so that's at least a plus.
"I got immersed in tik tok dramas" wow this is rock bottom
Huh. I remember the Joneses movie being kind of popular at the time, and it was okay. That one surprised me.
Hollywood is wasting Paul Wesley, he is such a good actor.
This was cool and all but maybe you should try something else
There is this movie came out quite a while ago, called Thoroughbreds, I think you would really like it! (I’ve only watched the trailer but it looks really good! 😂)
i loved this idea KEEP IT UP CHIEF!
with the first movie that had the groundhog day concept i just think if you're going to make a movie that has kind of the same plot as another one (like groundhog day, or a movie about body switching like freaky friday) you gotta change it up somehow or its just the same movie. like happy death day was a movie about a girl in a time loop, but it was a horror movie. groundhog day was originally a comedy and the first movie is supposed to be a comedy so it just feels like the same thing but about teenagers and its bad
Boooy the new Twilight book is out and you haven't talked about it yet.. what is happening.?
Love this type of videos😍❤️
At the risk of inflating Dylan's ego, I must say I love that shirt.  Dylan has such style.
Bad match is actually so good tho
LATE. NIGHT. DYLANNNNN
But it's Monday 😣😣😣😣
I just started an Instagram page dedicated to mental health awareness. I would appreciate anyone who checks it out it’s @redefiningstigma
I watched premature. It was... an experience
This was really funny😂 they all look like absolutely terrible movies though 🤢 especially the puberty one
Nobody: Dylan: block, throat punch, vagina chop
More please!!! I fell down the movie trailer hole before on youtube as well which actually led me to your channel 😁😁
When Bad Match has a higher score than the Godfather you know the site is trash
definitely do this again, also you should still rate the ones that aren't out yet just to find out if you're prophetic lol
*He really uploaded at the same exact time as Selena Gomez. Yea, you guessed whose video I watched first right.*
Someone take ma advice and shave his semi_ beard 🙂😂😂✌
I was so shook when I say paul wesley
„Vampire Dairys guy“
I watched keeping up with the jonses in the movies but it was meh
Damn I wish he had done “after we collided” it was right under the first one he clicked. 😂 oh well that’s ok
*not a recommendation for the channel, just one for you cause you said you like masked intruder movies*  The movie Hush on Netflix if you haven’t seen it 😊
“teenagers don’t pray to Beyonce!” me while lighting my candles on my Beyonce altar:          👁👁
okay I guess we gotta watch Bad Match for a commentary Monday Dylan
Do this more often, It's hilarious
off topic: mary shelley is actually so good
such a good idea!
I recommend that you do more videos like this
Premature is very disgustingly copying the book 11 birthdays by Wendy Mass
You should call this series Chillin with Dylan
Would you say that......... that....... dylan is chillin.....? 😀
the way his videos make me so happy
I watched Mary Shelley yesterday and kinda sad he didn’t watch the trailer. Would’ve wanted to know what he thought of it
I remember there was a time last year that youtube kept showing me trailers for hindu's movies as ads... I couldn't understand anything but some looked really good and interesting...  Also, bad match it's not as bad as one would think, although Dylan could guess the ending 10 minutes into the movie
Work it is trash just so you know
I really want that shirt it's so pretty🥺
when u casually spend literally all your time on youtube so u have watched all these trailers
That last trailer came with a twist ending rating. A bullshit 100% rating.. didn't see that coming lol
watch good time and the lighthouse king,, nvm you don’t take recommendations 👎
I saw keeping up with the Joneses on a plane and it was alright. Not great
damn, i really enjoyed Keeping Up with the Joneses lol
okay about Work It. The script was the worst part of the entire thing, but the choreography is phenomenal and all the music bangs so. and I personally like the cinematography, like there's a dance scene that's all one continuous shot so you focus on the characters and another shot later that's handheld so you can feel the instability of the character. It's overall decent
I will say that Work It was a lot better than I thought it would be from the trailer.
I'm glad you went with this video idea instead! I always watch these trailers and never the movie
Vigana chop 😿👋🏾💀
Wow. I've watched the second movie and I had totally forgotten about it.
DO A LATE NIGHT DYLAN ABOUT HOW WE FAILED MEGAN FOX!
I saw the bad match and it's really bad
could u react to ‘Hollywood’ netflix trailer? it’s a masterpiece.
My dream is for Dylan to see the version of Brazilian High School Music
Did he not recognize Paul Wesley?
Chilling with Dylan. FREAKING PAUL WESLEY how did they get him?
I’ve seen part of Late Bloomer but...
This was really fun.
Dylan: "Scott Pilgrim guy"   The Perks of Being a Wallflower: Am i a joke to you?
I am not recommending any trailer, just letting you know that I would in fact like another video like this. Thank you for your attention.
Honestly kinda liked work it won’t lie.
I remember wanting to watch Premature years ago because Katie Findlay is in it. I'm so glad I didn't.
The cast of work it makes the movie 10 times enjoyable. I mean you can never go wrong with Jordan Fisher!
Ok but Mary Shelley is a MASTERPIECE
When he calls Paul Wesley "Vampire Diaries guy"   As if DYLAN didn't notice him playing Donnie in season 1 of The O.C.
Can we make movie trailers for a single director? One episode, one director
They took the “say what” from Hannah Montana
I just want him to react to Mama Boy because just because....it exists.            Edit: Just saw his ending message......this comment will still stand on its own. Soooo.....how’s y’all’s day going?😅
I thought Keeping up with the Joneses was funny
i saw the mary shelley movie in theaters with my mom because i really admire mary shelley and like.m the movie had wonderful costumes and one scene i really liked but otherwise it was way too focused on the romance w percy shelley which is kind of ridiculous since mary shelley did so much more than just marry some random poet.. like she literally invented the sci fi genre and u wanna talk about some dumb boy she liked?? plus the movie ended with the publication of Frankenstein which is also a bit sad because thats not all she did in her life and even after her life was definitely interesting enough to have it be in the movie!! but enough ranting about my special interest, at least the soundtrack was good
Why'd you think I'd watch a guy judge movies he doesn't even care about by their trailers? I did tho
Movie dialogue in 30 years is gonna be like “I wanna yeet myself off a cliff” or some zoomer shit like that
The fact that I’ve seen all but one of these movies .....
Premature was actually funny and kinda good💀💀💀💀💀
I heard a thing about trust from a book, not sure which one but it basically said: Trust is like glass. Once it’s broken, you can try to put it back together again, but it will never be perfect.
This sweater looks like you just killed someone
This is how I find movies to put on my to watch list honestly a great way of finding ones you’ve never heard of
Noooo Dylan keeping up with the Joneses was actually good, the trailer is such a misrepresentation of the movie. Idk how the ratings are so bad
I literally had a thought yesterday like "I'd love it if Dylan just watched movie trailers. I'd watch that" and here we are.
so no ones gonna menchen Paul Wesley in the second movie  edit: never mind he did kind of
Work It is a lot better than the trailer portrays it.
Watching the trailers myself first and then watching Dylan's reaction to it made this even funnier because you experience the cringe while just imagining what Dylan's reaction will be to it!
Okay but I really like Keeping Up with the Joneses... maybe I just have terrible taste 👁👄👁 (also I would enjoy it if this became a series thx)
as a pisces, i feel completely offended about the tinder movie
I have seen almost all these trailers just cause I get bored and watch old movie trailers
9:09 literally. I hate it when they try to sound hip and then end up making teenagers sound so incompetent and naive. It's so annoying
15:30 'vagina chop'
Are we not going to talk about Dylan’s self defense move Vagina chop?!
*Seeing that movie have 100%. is the biggest plot twist of the year.*    Edit: wow I leave this comment for a while it’s been 2 weeks I’ve never gotten this many likes thanks a lot 👌
This is a suggestion
in regards to Work It, why do they keep making movies like this? it would’ve been fine in like 2014-2016 but now they’re just trying way too hard. i get they want to appeal to teens but i feel like most of us don’t laugh at that shit anymore. same goes for The Kissing Booth.
Yeah! More this.
bad match looks like a lifetime movie
Dylan should Direct a movie.
Mary Shelly is amazing
you should definitely continue this
Now i think you need to watch Bad Match, cause there's no way that thing is a 100% thermometer movie, wtf lmao
Not a recommendation, but a request. Do an episode with just horror movie trailers please. Thank you.
"he could over power her" not everyone is 6'11" Dylan
only watched late bloomer for Brittany Snow...I don’t remember what happened tho.
dylan i’m begging you to please not watch work it
When you heard about most of them but didn't watch any and thanks god they are terrible
Teenagers are actually GenZ you’re probably near the cut off age between millennial and GenZ
Pretty Much It did a commentary on Bad Match and it was hilarious!
Me: Oh cool. Late bloomer is about my pituitary condition! Dylan: So he had a tumor on his penis
okay you cant bring up Mary Shelley and then not watch Mary Shelley
Netflix really tried to do Step Up over again and thought we wouldn’t notice.
Meh
Please watch work it it’s on Netflix and it has good cinematic shots with an all right story line. It’s right up your ally
Ok, I was really good at this guessing game....Until the last one. 100 %, like WTF?
That shit was sanitary!
Nice shirt weeb
in bad match when it said it’s a pair, what if that they was a pun because the site was named head over heels. 😳
I've actually heard some good things about Bad Match. It's not entirely what you think from the trailer. You're complaining about "she's not scary. You could just overpower her." Yeah... _exactly. She's not the _*_scary_*_ one._
wait dylan this made my day ahaha
Dylan in a shirt with colours, for some reason I’m amused😂  But anyways loving this video concept keep it up!!
Who was shocked to see Paul Wesley?!
I really enjoyed this video concept. I’d love to see this as a series!   As far as Work It, I only watched it because I like Sabrina, but it was a cute movie. Far from a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it. The rotten tomatoes score is 82% as of right now.
okay so i’ve seen bad match, honestly it’s not that’s bad in my opinion. it has a pretty cool twist in the end that you don’t even see coming. the premise is obviously really goofy and some bits don’t totally make sense but for the budget they had they did pretty good.
dylan: is he a therapist who has sex with his clients? the guy: *is a sex therapist* me: well yes but actually no
I thought you were going to react to After’s new movie trailer, you should see that
I WISH HE WOULD HAVE WATCHED THE RIDDLEY SCOTT TRAILER FOR “RAISED BY WOLVES” THAT IS ONE OF THEE MOST BIZARRE TRAILERS IVE SEEN IN YEARS!!! AND ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A CHANCE IT COULD BE PRETTY GREAT. But Sci-fi horror I feel has zero middle ground just like comedies..it is either awesome or terrible.
I swear that last one is rigged, there’s absolutely no way it got 100%
Now this is what u call CONTENT
*Movies:* [have a suspenseful scene] *Dylan every episode:* Have you tried a throat punch?
0% is the score I give Rotten Tomatoes in terms of trustworthiness at least when it comes to my taste in movies. YAHOO MOVIES used to be my go to but now that sucks too...So I have to make IMDB work. My system is ANYTIME IT IS A HORROR FILM YOU HAVE TO ADD AT MINIMUM 1.5-2.5 AND WHEN IT IS A COMEDY YOU HAVE TO ADD 0.5-1.5. ROTTEN TOMATOES ONLY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT OSCAR WORTHY ACTING PERFORMANCES AND I COULD CARE LESS!! ROTTEN TOMATOES IS ABSOLUTELY TRASH WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING AN ACCURATE SCORE AT LEAST WITH A COMMON AUDIENCE. COMEDIES GET IT THE WORST AND IT IS REALLY SAD TO SEE...AND PARTLY THAT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST SOOOO MANY BAD COMEDIES, DECENT COMEDIES THAT HAD THE STUDIOS HANDS IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS WAYYY TOO MUCH, HAD A TRAILER THAT SHOWED ALL OF THE FUNNY PARTS OR INCLUDED PARTS THAT WERENT EVEN IN THE MOVIE, ETC SO WHEN A COMEDY IS ACTUALLY GOOD AND GENUINELY FUNNY PEOPLE TEND TO OVER LOOK IT OR ASSOCIATE IT WITH ALL OF THE CRAP THEY HAVE SEEN.
Dylan should seriously review anime films, I'd be very into it
If you’re interested, pretty much it covered the last movie on their channel awhile ago.
I'm glad you didn't make a tiktok video.... Cause I'm a 25 year old adult and I definitely wouldve skipped a video about tiktok
I’ve watched Bad match its not terrible
Im so mad he didn’t pick after we collided cause i rlly wanted to see his reaction😂
I liked the late bloomer whoops
At this point, how can people still have faith in their recommendations in this channel comment section?? 😂😂😂
I literally just watched Work It and I was like "I wonder what Dylan would think of this"
How was THAT 100 percent!?!??!?!?!?!?!
Bad Match it’s pretty good....
the only one out of these i’ve seen is Bad Match💀 it was  b a d
YOU TELLING ME THAT MY BOY BRAM FROM LOVE SIMON IS IN THAT TRASH NETFLIX SHOW
When Liza said "Why do we look like a bunch of dental hygienists?" I laughed out loud ALSO the light behind the couch looks SO good (we aren't low budget anymore folks 😂)
I actually liked Work It thoughhh. Surprisingly, Liza Koshy was my favorite part of that movie. Prolly liked it bc I set my standards lower than tall girl
Dylan you need to react to marVISTA trailers the editors taking revealing the whole plot to another level. You literally find out who the killer is and all the plot twists in the trailer.
I just wanted to point out that "Bad Match", the movie with a 100% score, was only reviewed by 8 critics. This movie had the least amount of ratings from critics, while 122 critics reviewed "Keeping Up with the Joneses." So for "Bad Match" to get a 100% rating, only EIGHT movie critics had to have a somewhat positive review of the movie (like a 3 or 3.5 out of 5).
“Vampire diaries guy” dont ever do Paul Wesley like that again😤
Can you react to instant family because why nOt
I was lauging out loud at Zach Galifianakis though...
Me: get scared with the jump scare in the last trailer Dylan: that’s not scary Me: Yeah that’s not scary
Dylan: but he's stronger than her  SHE HAS A KNIFE, DYLAN!
I'm thinking that the way they should've made that bad match movie was playing into all the horrible things a person can do to another without physically assaulting them. Manipulation, verbal abuse, hacking their social media and being horrible to others in their name; only the child pornography thing came close to it, but that's too endgame. The point shouldn't be how far _she_ will go in stalking/harassing him but the point should be, what line will _he_ cross to stop her. When his friends and family and job leave him and the police doesn't believe him, will he betray his own character too?
Dylan you know the youngest millennials 26 Gen-z are teenagers
Yea y'all should watch Bad Match lol thats all im going to say
Please keep the long hair !! Looks so good on you 😍
Late bloomers was that mad remind me of a knock off of 40 year virgin.
the amount of serotonin i get from seeing that dylan uploaded AND hearing him say toodles at the end
I’m in class but I’m not paying attention because- Dylan comes before school 😀
Please do more of this!!
Please do this again! This was so funny and you're so good at it!
Premature is actually unironically one of my favourite movies, the trailer doesn’t do it justice
I can’t believe bad match is the perfect movie
14:08 As someone who has regrettably watched this film, I can confirm that this is indeed the plot...
Oh my gosh the after we collided trailer was literally right there and he didn't watch it 😢
Work it is not as bad as tatbilb and tkb, or maybe is my love for Sabrina trying to convince me kskdks and yasss I need you to watch it 😔
I’ve seen Bad Match and it’s pretty good.
I watched Premature & The Late Bloomer a little while ago 😂 I just watched Work It last night & it is SOOOOO GOOD🔥
Pleaseeee react to WORK IT!!! It's on Netflix
Dylan you should watch the movies ruby red, sapphire blue and emerald green. It’s based on books and I think you’d have a lot to say about them lol 😂😂
Dylan and I said “Jane Lynch” at the same time 😂
I have to give Bad Match credit. I actually enjoyed it, as a thriller, but they did a pretty decent job with the limited budget they had.
In one your videos you mentioned a book your friend wrote ‘Dark of The West’. and you said there’s a character based on you. The book arrived finally and can’t wait to read it 😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤
React to after we collided trailer
7:40 YOU DIDN’T RECOGNIZE BRTTANY SNOW
bruh that first movie premature is noah and brooke from scream this is wild AND the trailer had my favorite song??? oh god
I'm a firm believer in the fact that if a movie has a great cast but it made no noise the movie's trash
Okey so the thing about the "bad match" is that it's a misdirect, it feels like it's going to go one direction but it has twists so I knew it would have a decent score
You should actually watch Bad Match. Not for a commentary necessarily, but you'll... you'll be surprised by it.
hot summer nights its SO good
julius ceasar also hated these trailers
CHILLIN like a VILLIAN with DYLAN      omg I'm so sorry
Dylan really made a video of my weird habit. Does anyone else spend time watching a bunch of random movie trailers for movies you have never heard of and will probably never watch? Or are you normal?
Dylan, 40 year olds ARE millennials, gen z are teens lmaooo
yess more vids like this!! loved it <3
I watched Work It a few days ago and I actually enjoyed it! It wasn't as bad as most Netflix originals I feel like
You would love the show Russian Doll
So Jeff is recommended to you.......
Love this idea!
PLEASE react to that shitty movie work it
The problem with Bad Match is the way it’s shot and graded it looks like a Music Video / Indie Short Film
Please play life is strange
Can you do a horror movie trailers next???? Please?
Dylan seriously we miss movie commentary mondaayyyy
All of these movie trailers are edited like they are college humour skits
didn’t pretty much it do a commentary on bad match and it turned out to be like lowwwwkey good????  think it got taken down :(
i really enjoy the chill zone, pls do more of these
what does it say about me that i’ve watched the full premature movie when I was a teen?...
YOU SHOULD HAVE REACTED TO THE TRAILER OF AFTER WE COLLIDED IT WAS THERE😂😭
I love u
i saw the first 2 movies he looked at and I didn't think they were bad movies.  I liked them, but then again when those movies came out I was still a teenager so it could have been just that.
Can u check IMDB
IT WAS STEPHEN 🥺🥺🥺
Pretty much it watched bad match
Can you please watch the bad match movie so I don't have to?
REACT TO HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE
I missed your videos. 🥺
9.20 the fact that Dylan thinks teenagers are millenials ...
Omg, Dylan the Mary Shelley movie is so good. It really deserves more popularity
I hate that I've watched three of these... Though tbf, I don't remember most of them.
What happened in 2016, man .....
Ok but seriously I'm kinda sad that Dylan won't watch 365 days because someone recommended it already ... his commentary would be gold
so ... does that mean i’m supposed to watch bad match now?
Never watched those movies (I'm never going to) but this is what I do when im bored jaja watch movie trailers, so yeah do more 🤪
I can’t believe he didn’t use this opportunity to call it “Chillin’ with Dylan” instead of the “Chill Zone” 😅
That 100% on the last trailer is the real reason it has "Thriller" in the title
So I've seen 3/5 of these movies.
You should watch Bad Match to confirm this insanity
watch the avengers movie trailer
Would defo watch more videos of this
“chillin with Dylan”😎
Who new kid flash was in work it
If this becomes a series then choose the film that got the highest score out of all of them and do a video on that movie
I love this video!
Honestly...i liked Work it. My little sister was watching so i watched it with her and i enjoyed the dances
I’m gonna kill the 31 people that unliked it
nobody gonna talk about that shirt thought                                                                     it slaps
There's no way that last movie has 100% x'DDD wth? the trailer looked like a comedy the whole time!
work it wasn't actually that bad. and really im only saying that because of jordan fisher and keiynan lonsdale I LOVE THEM
Premature is...     Nice.
I SAID 46% AND IT WAS 48
I feel happy we got a 'toodles', anyone else?
When you’ve seen every movie trailer that he watched.
ready for the next trailer review ;)
So "Chillin' with Dylan"?
I love it that Dylan is too lazy to do a whole movie commentary so now he’s roasting trailers
I thought you were going to react to the after we collided trailer 🥺
a while back ago when you played detroit become human i think you asked for video game recommendations and i think you should play life is strange!! it's a choice-based game with an emphasis on the butterfly effect just like until dawn and i think you would like it a lot!!
Watch the trailer to After 2
LOOOOL i kind of liked late bloomer. It's defo your type of review film
bad match had an interesting plot... i didn't watch it myself tho, but my mom did, and ill give it that
I feel bad cause I watched the first 2 movies
React to Work It!
Anyone else in love with Dylan or is it just me 😂😂😂
Dang, you only posted this today and already over 1,000 comments.  I remember when your channel was small and just changing over from the music channel.  LOL.  Not sure if you'll see this comment and not recommending a movie or a trailer, but was more thinking, what about a theme?  Like all from the same year? or all with the same actor in them?  Cause gosh, I've seen the same actor get an academy nomination and a Razzie in the same year!  (Melissa McCarthy for 2 different films in 2019.)
Dylan, honey, you know that the youngest millenials are born in 1997 so are about 22/23
Not seen or heard any of these movies ever ....also yes you should do more videos like this
Now you have to watch Bad Match
I've watched a movie trailer on recommended and then just clicked through the suggestions to the side afterwards lol. I had seen the trailer for Work It and thought liked ok. Also has seen trailer for Late Bloomer, looked meh. Saw movie Keeping up With The Jonses and it had some funny parts but was just ok
About that one trailer, I've got only one thing to say: Wowser.  You know which one.
ask kaneki ken for his experience with his BAD match.
Dylan's fighting school: throat punch+vagina chop. The end
Keeping up with the Joneses. I walked out of that movie.
work it was *chefs kiss* perfect the bisexual energy HURTS
Somehow Dylan always misses or misinterprets things and it lowkey just is annoying. Like when the second movie mentions tumour in the brain. But he misunderstood it
I had such low expectations for Work it yet was pleasantly surprised? Still not good but ya know better than expected
LNFOA I REMEMBER PREMATURE. it’s so weird those people were in the tv show scream
I don't think theres a single movie in cinema history that Dylan ACTUALLY enjoys
I LOVE this format!! Do more, pleaaaaase!!!  And hi :)
I really like the "super chill, chill zone" time.  You should definitely make more.
I’ve actually watch premature it was fine ...
Maybe I'm trash but just watching the first two trailers I've seen both movies and actually enjoyed them
Fun video
i really liked the directing critique u did for Let It Snow. You should do that again.
Why is it that when I saw this I was badly hoping for After We Collided My wish was ruined to see him see it and then not click on it 💔
i enjoyed watching keeping up with the joneses 👁👄👁
ok, I've actually seen Keeping up with Joneses...
Watching bad trailers is a guilty pleasure of mine...
Why does she have to be a Pisces I’m a Pisces(¬､¬)
Can we all take a moment to appreciate how smart this dude actually is like damn ❤😍
please please please do a movie commentary for work it
I've seen all of these trailers and none have ever convinced me to watch them.
I love this style/concept of video. Id love to see more trailer score guessing.
The principle from the first trailer is Alan Tudyk; the voiceactor for Turbo from Wreck it Ralph and the hen Heihei from Moana
"Once it's gone... it's a bad thing"?? Is this an actual script? I've read much more profound one-liners in fanfics
This was fun! I guessed the same as Dylan on all except the Joneses one, which I guessed close to right at 23%
I think it’s time for.......          A Quarantine haircut
Hi Dylan I know you hate recommendations but this is not technically that but it would be funny if the next time you found 100% score in this series you’re required to watch it because let’s be real the likelihood of you finding another one is very low just a suggestion
Please watch  Wild child ,Aquamarine , It’s a boy girl thing , sleepover ,  what a girl want , picture this , starstruck , 16 wishes , the clique , Lizzie McGuire
when there is a CC icon under the thumbnail but its not actually available...
Sad that you didn’t watch the “After we collided” trailer,you reacted to first part of this movie “After”,hoping for your reaction to the second one.
Can you pls watch the Norwegian “skam”? Subtitles are available...
Well dylan why didn't you watch trailer of awc i mean why...its like awsome great and everything......  a message to you from an afternator ...you have watched the first one which was After which was trash and the second one is like wow........  ok Dude do watch it
This was great please do more of these!
Now you need to watch bad match, it must be done
Has anyone here actually seen "bad match" and can explain the RT score ??? I just can't believe this.
Hope you’ll do a video on After 2
Please keep this as a series it was too funny
Can we get him to watch Hamilton? I'd looovee that
I never saw any of this, Thanks
I feel like dylan has never been in a fight. Yeah i could take on armed oppented. Just do a throat punch and instant death
DUDE NO JOKE I GUESSED 42 FOR BAD MATCH
“Vagina chop” lmao what?
I think I speak for all of us when I say: MAKE THIS A SERIES :)
I just thought of a good Groundhog Day type comedy. The virgin meets the girl of his dreams and they have sex at the end of the day.... and before he can get off... the day starts over. It’s called ANTICLIMAX
Ok I don’t know what you guys say but I liked work it. My main issue tho, is that it it ended way too early. They stretched the plot in the middle too much and when they won, I thought they just won like the first round or something, but surprise surprise they won the whole competition in one dance.
I heard Dylan wanted a detailed list of trailers and movies to watch...
yup, i’m a rat.. i’ve seen The Late Bloomer and i enjoyed it.
Please make a movie reaction to the Oscar award winning movie «Parasite»! It will definetely blow your mind
Dylan Uploaded on my birthday! Thx for the gift Dylan
DYLAN!! THE TRAILER FOR ‘AFTER WE COLLIDED’ (the sequel to ‘after’) RIGHT THERE AND YOU DIDNT WATCH IT IM UPSETTTT
I see you are taking interest in one of my favourite hobbies, watching numerous trailers to movies Il never watch.
Keeping Up With The Joneses is not the Spy Kids it thinks it is
I hate when people say "oh that guy can over power her" women can be strong to.
I remember watching the trailer for bad match and in the comments, someone said that the main guy got in a fight with someone playing a video game and then the video game guy hacked his computer and planted child porn, so it wasn’t even the girl
Teen wolf best
Premature is one of my favourite comedy movies
Teen wolf
yeah, go watch bad match. It's not that predictable :)
Teen wolf
I know you don’t take requests but I really think you should watch Work It
Teen wolf
Me: 15% definitely                                                                                 Dylan: this is low, I’m thinking 15%                         Me:   👁👄👁
the late bloomer looks so ridiculously bad that i want to watch it so bad too
Teen wolf
Teen wolf
Teen wolf
Teen wolf
You should watch premature!!
Yes please make this a series
this was fun !!! also, i might check bad match out..
17:01 When you get the wrong package from amazon
I literally just watched Work It like 20 minutes ago. It was HORRIBLE but it was, yk, decent for a netflix movie
5:59 Paul Wesley....... 😱😱😱
WATCH WORK IT PLEASE ITS ACTUALLY GOOD
Dylan criticizing movies for bad jokes when most of the jokes he makes in his videos are bad. 🤣
Ok ok ok ok ok..... I know but..... you will have the time of your life watching the birdemic trailer I actually think Im the only one that even knows about that movie Plz Dylan is so bad, I know you dont want us to recommend anything but hahahah
More movie trailers!✨ No recommendations!✨
You’ve got to watch he After we collided trailer
You telling me not to recommend MAKES me wanna recommend 😭
Love late bloomer! Actually a pretty good movie! Funny during the first trailer was like I wonder what he’d think of late bloomer and bamn next one
lmao I really enjoyed this video and I haven't seen any of these trailers before either so it was a lot more enjoyable
I feel like you’re underestimating that girl simply because she’s a girl (I’m a girl but have proper fighting experience and have disarmed and beaten plenty of guys in fights- it’s not about strength, it’s about skill) and also it seems a little dismissive to men who get abused by women. Maybe he doesn’t know how to fight, maybe he’s terrified of her, etc.
Ok, but who hacked Rotten Tomatoes and gave that movie a 100%?? It can't be true
keeping up with the joneses and work it were good compared to what their trailers were like 😳
I thought Keeping Up With The Joneses was really good! But then again... I was like 12 sooo...
i really ✨manifested✨ a dylan upload and im not mad about it🧚🏼‍♂️✨💖
Since he loves grading, cool transitions and all that so much I feel like he’ll LOVE Euphoria
When you realize that's gal Gadot aka wonder woman
Movie about Joneses is litteraly the same as The Whole Nine Yards 😅
Dylan move your lazy ass and make some merch for troublemakers
@kurtisconner should do this 😎
Do another video but guessing the plot instead (and I mean the whole thing)
11:18 WHAT ARE YOU SAYING SIR?
The Jones movie looked like it was trying too hard to be like Date Night with Steve Carell and Tina Fey
I literally watched "Work It" yesterday and thought to myself "Man, that would be funny if Dylan did a movie commentary on this one", but ofc it's my thoughts only, no recommendations whatsoever
ik he doesnt take recommendations but i rlly want him to watch train to busan
Did anyone see the trailer for After we collided, at the start of this vid? 😂
no joke i said 49% for premature   it’s like i have espn or something 😶
Love the concept! Yes please do more!
I like this format. I'm hoping to see more.
Reactive power rangers
Ive watched Work it and the trailer is very crinchy, but the entire movie was actually pretty decent
100 % .... Pfffft hahahahahaha 😂🤣🤣
Dylan finally monetising his psychic-like-movie-rating abilities.
i think the only thing you can do now dylan is watch the movie that got 100% for a video 😔
do this again plz
How old is Dylan? I'm still baffled that he didn't know that the pituitary gland is in your brain? Like, mans actually thought the main character had a tumor in his penis that effected his puberty.
More of this! I gave that bad match a 14%
Movie: * exists*  Reviewers: HILARIOUS, INCREDIBLE, STUNNING, JAW DROPPING
Dylan should watch the film with the trailer that scores highest on the tomatometer in the next vid
Dylan: That's not funny Me: Laughs...yeah it's not
Dylan...please never call this the chill zone again...please.
I watched Keeping up with the Joneses and weirdly enjoyed but I enjoyed even more the fact that I actually guessed some percentages right!
I know the video is lighthearted, but having a 'bad match' or a tinder date gone wrong is one of the worst nightmares of any girl. It makes you think how men aren't afraid👀
"40 yo writers need to stop writing script for teenage movies" LOVE YOU FOR SAYING THIS DYLAN! ITS HIGH TIME NETFLIX REALISED THIS!
You should watch a movie in a different language
I’m horrible at this game. I like it though, DO MORE!!
Biggest Plot Twist at the end💀
This was great! Please do it again 🥰
Pretty Much It did a commentary on Bad Match I’m pretty sure, that’s the only possible reason that I recognize it, other than that I have no idea what any of these are.
Thought he was gonna react to the after we collided trailer 😔
Dylan making fun of dated teen lingo when he says "Dawg" lol what year is it? 2002? With that dancing movie though, would rather watch.... literally any other dance movie
Dylan, the 40-year olds ARE the millenials. The youngest Millenials are 24
Hey Dylan it would be cool if you were to watch King Kong(2005) for a video. It’s an awesome adventure with much emotion that I think you would enjoy
It’s BEE-yonce not bae ffs
Please watch more Harry styles and Disney movies! Especially Brave and the princess and the frog!!💕
Bad Match pisses me off, because it's an over used fear-mongering that doesn't happen in real life. And critics eat it up!!! The percentage of dudes framed for something they didn't do is WAY LOWER than actual sexual predators, rapists, and abusers; of those accused, only a tiny percentage go to jail; and of that, an even more miniscule amount were wrongly convicted. Dating and relationship-driven violence against women happen constantly, and yet movie writers are always like "bUt WhAt If A dUdE mEeTs A cRaZy ChIcK?!" 😠
As an asexual person, The Late Bloomer kinda offends me.
chill
Why did his muted voice at 11:17 make me so sad like what if i missed a killer joke this not OK
I really like this vid; you should do this more often! I'm not gonna recommend a specific trailer, but maybe you could do more thriller trailers?
Dylan this was painful 🥺
I know you don’t take recommendations but I just wanted to let you know that the DUFF is now back to Netflix if you ever want to watch it
I like your shirt, Dylan.
anyone else recognise bad match from pretty much it 😭
Please actually watch Work It 😂 it wasn’t thaaaaaaat bad lol it’s cute
Dylan, I know you hate recs but I just watched Knives Out and it's one of the best movies I've seen–the plot and cast and shots are so great
I vaguely remember Keeping Up With The Joneses but I completely forgot Zach Galifiankis was in it.  Also I know you don't listen to suggestions but on principle you should watch Bad Match to see how the hell it got scored so high. haha
UM... “vagina chop”??? 😂😂😂 well that’s a new phrase added to my vocabulary
Ive seen most of the late bloomer and literally had to stop watching it, it was so bad. Like the worst kind of awkward raunchy humor. And i love awkward raunchy humor
Okay but he needs to watch before I fall. That movie is so good
You need to watch work it!!!
damn I remember this other movie called the Joneses that explored consumerism which is cool and all,, but the scene that stuck in my mind was when the "daughter" tried to sneak into the "father's" bed and when she was caught, telling the "mom"  if you're not going to sleep with him, why can't I? And I was so shocked like... I didn't realize they weren't a real family until that scene lol
Dr: you have a pituitary gland tumor Dylan: so heee basically has a tumor in his penis.....
Paul wesleys name is now vampire diaries guy
Low-key hoping he watches one of the movies  😂
I actually liked Work It, they put all the worst jokes in the trailer though
I was trying to figure out where i heard Bad Match before and Pretty Much It made a track on it
WHY DIDN'T DYLAN MAKE A NOAH JOKE ON THAT "WOAH WOAH WOAH" IN THE JONASES MOVIE😂😂
*sigh* ... i saw work it before video.... BUT ITS NOT THAT BAD (i think you'd like it)
dylan pretty much it did a video on bad match smh
yess I love this concept! now I can watch someone submerge themselves in weird movie trailers and not so it myself for hours
Is it bad I've seen most of these movies?!
Let's be real here, Dylan has a bunch of movies written down that he will never watch all because some idiot said, "oMG wHo ThInkS DyLAn sHouLD wAtcH...." 😂😂
You HAVE to watch Bad Match now 😂 100% it is 💁‍♀️
Honestly, i'm living for this new series even though my tomato guesses weren't even close.
The chemistry in work it is absolutely insane tho
Dylan drop your Letterboxed link already!
I love you daddy
yaay!! been waiting for a new video. missed you Dylan 😊😊
The YouTube trailer hole is so dangerous but this is such a good idea for a series on your channel oh my goodness
Ngl I was actually surprised of how much I liked “work it” 🤷🏻‍♀️
React to AFTER WE COLLIDED
after the last trailer getting a good review, i don’t trust rotten tomato😭
Dylan Please watch Work It on Netflix!!
i've only heard of bad match because pretty much it did a commentary vid on it lmao
You should watch the Umbrella Academy !!!
YES. I waste hours watching movie trailers so this is my ideal Dylan video honestly lol
this was  a chill hang , thank you for having me
dylan, i like your sweater very much. where do i buy it please bro
I also say late bloomer.... i have a problem with watching bad movies...
Ooh next time can we read the reviews cause I feel like they are just full of tea
But where did he get that sweater tho👀😍
That work it movie... Jordan Fisher and Liza were the best parts. It was just... Now very good
Millennials are not teenagers Lolol 😂😂😂❤️
I think you now need to watch bad match...there is NO way that is a good movie!!
“Top or bottom, make a choice”  -Dylan 2020
Nice shirt
My Mum is literally watching that "Work It" Movie in the other room, Whilst I'm watching this video. I'm scared.
I've seen every one of those trailers but I've never watched the whole movies
Dylan, the pituitary gland is in your brain
lmaooo it was either punch or vagina chop😂😂
He should have just watched Timothée Chalamet trailers and Timothée Chalamet trailers only
Just chillin’ with Dylan
i saw premature!!!! its not that bad tbh
I watched work it and i loved it probably bc i was blinded by my love for Jordan Fisher
Go agane
Part 2 please...
Do a part 2 and react to “After We Collided” trailer please!!! It’s the sequel to the movie “After” that you reacted to. And react to “Work It” on Netflix with Liza
I really hope this becomes a series, it was really entertaining :)
This’ll be a good series please continue!
Ok but did u watch hot summer nights?
When I saw the late bloomer trailer, I thought the title and actors looked familiar. Then I remember that I had seen the movie for sale before. When I worked at dollar tree. Trust me when I say that any movie that makes its way to the sad shelf of $1 movies is NOT good so a 20-22% rating tracks.
Review the bad match oneee
The fact that I would actually laugh at all the jokes Dylan said were not funny 😔
Trailer title: says it’s a thriller Dylan: is surprised when it’s a thriller
Watch teen wolf best show
Dylan, honey... the tumour was on his pituitary👁👄👁
Sometimes critics love a movie and their criterias are things that general audiences just do not care about so I'm not surprised that last movie had such a wide gap between critics' and audience rating lol
wait iv actually seen keeping up with the jonses and its not actually that bad i promise
What I concluded from this video is that I am indeed a rat and I will eat trash
Mary Shelley is actually one of my favorite movies
Now I can’t wait for him to react to Work it
Dylan did you fotoshop that 100% because that just can't be real?
Dylan: calls teenagers millennials  Me, 16yr old: 👁👄👁
i was so mad when he didn't click after we collided. i need his reaction to that .
How to defend yourself from a girl, according to Dylan:  *block, VAGINA CHOP*
Dylan is literally doing what I do when I can't fall asleep watch a bunch of movie trailers to movies you'll never watch
I've been binging on dylan so much that I've developed a mini dylan in my head. Yes. I have a movie commentary dylan all the time😂
Guessed 45% for the first movie--RT score was 48%. Guessed 20% for 2nd movie--RT score was 20%. Guessed 15% for 3rd movie--RT score was 20%.(comedies are never funnier than their trailers and this trailer wasn't funny). Guessed 12% for 4th movie--RT score was 100%, which must be a fuck-up lol...
When he recognised Paul Wesley from vampire diaries I full on screamed
You know there's a problem when Dylan says to stop with the sex jokes.
okay this series would definitely hit
Can you react to IT2
Bad match has an insane ending. Pretty Much It did a reaction to it.
Dylan: "It has to be a low score" Score: *is 100%*
I actually liked Bad Match. It’s really not that bad 🤷🏽‍♀️ the ending was kinda shocking a lil bit
I've seen Bad Match. I'm not sure how, but if anyone knows how to delete certain experiences from your brain, I would like to volunteer to delete all existences of that movie, from mine. Although I am curious about the other movies now...
I could watch Dylan do this all day
why is this man soooo against recommendations
*anyone else notice that Dylan was in a square and not a circle? Feels so wrong*
Didn't PMI react to Bad Match? It's great
Petition for Dylan to review Hamilton!
I'm sad to admit that I've watched "The late bloomer" and from what I remember it was really not good at all despite the well known actors in the cast 🤣🤣 EDIT: my memory was right according to the reviews haha, also I commented too early, I've also seen "Work it" and Sabrina and Jordans perfomances really helped a lot with its quality ngl 😅 it was actually alright, not as bad as expected
You mean to tell me you know of the vampire diaries but never talked about it 🙀
i need this video 50 more times pls if i don't get a part two i will be pressing charges 😌
Oh god...i guess I forgot that I watched Bad Match a long time ago, cuz I was just unfortunately reminded 😩 *Spoiler Alert* it's truly terrible.
oh pleeease watch bad match. the ending was surprisingly unexpected
I think we all wanna know if the “watching the last episode of shows” series is coming back
dylan: WHAT IS THIS CAST me 2 secs later: PAUL WESLEY!
You know what's worse? That there's no milennials who are teenagers left. The youngests are like 25. So they are even more lost when it come to their target audience.
I got a little too excited when I saw this video💀
do more videos like this please
dude I love this idea. definitely gonna do this with my friends
Loved this format, you should do more videos like this!
He’s starting to look more like Harry Potter then Flynn Rider
I love how chill this video is.
late bloomer is just when trans guys go on testosterone but with a cis dude
For Bad Match I have a theory: most of the people rating the movie are men. The movie is basically made for men. It’s the whole “man’s biggest fear” a crazy woman stalking him and framing him for illegal sexual things.
I watched Work It yesterday, it was fine, despite the cringe :P Good dance choregraphies at least
I didn't expect to see Paul Wesley in one of these trailers💀💀
the only reason i know the gay guy in the "Work It" movie is because he played Wally West on "The Flash" and after seeing this movie trailer i dont think the writers will want him back on the show. lol
Me casually waiting for the after we Collided trailer
I love this series! Keep doing it!! :)
The pituitary gland is in the brain Dylan, American sex Ed for you 😂😂😂
Can you react to blackpink How you like that
I’ve watched Premature, and I thought it was pretty good.
I watched bad match on Netflix and it was kind of okay. The trailer is very trash
How in the hell is oscar winner Jk Simmons, oscar nominated Kumail Nanjiani, multiple emmy winner Jane Lynch, and an SNL cast member C-list
You should react to "psycho but it's okay" kdrama it has 16 episodes and you are gonna like it alot coz it's a fantabulous drama with good lesson
Was I the only one freaking out about Paul Wesley
are millennials still teenagers?
You need to make more videos where you watch the last episodes of seasons from shows you haven't seen!!!
watch Love, Rosie :(
The pituitary gland is a small bean like shape located at the base of the brain, not the dick
React to Work it?
I smell bought reviews... also I have watched Late Bloomer
So so wrong about Work It  😂 it was awesome
I have just finished my papers and I'm watching DyLan talking , it feels like I'm hearing my bf complaining about not giving him enough time and attention.😂😂😘
If we bully you to post more pics on Instagram, will you?
16:45 Bad Match has a crazy twist
work it got 80% on rotten btw lol
Did I watch the work it movie just for jordan fisher? Yes yes I did
pls to this again i love this 💘
I watched bad match and it is kinda comedy, the ending is crazy and pretty funny in a "Damn" way. Thts probably why is was 100% on tomatoes.
C list cast????? Jane Lynch, JK Simmons & Kumail Nanjiani are not C list, Dylan 😂
I loved this! you should do more of this
lately why does it feel like Dylan always came up with these new titles for his new series, but none of them get second episode 😂
Work it is decent and has a good rt score tbh.
Just dropped everything I was doing for this😍
Since you reacted to the after movie you should react to the after we collided trailer
This is NOT a request but after we collided is coming out ( the second movie of after) and I think eveybody would love to see you react to it. But it’s NOT a request 😂
I actually watched Work It the other day and it's a decent movie. The trailer makes it look more stupid than it is.
i loveee this
i really thought you were about to click on after we collided damn i’m pissed
DYLANNNN WHY IT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO UPDATE¿¿??? Im starting run out of your videos to binge watch!
I CHOCKED when I saw Paul aka Stephan Salvatore 😭😭
You should watch the other premature movie on hulu!
no dylan, the pituitary gland is in the forebrain
have we ever thought of recommending shitty stuff so he's only left with the choice to watch good things?
I like the chill zone, I'll visit again
i watched keeping up with the joneses and it was a good movie
No joke, BAD MATCH is actually a very surprisingly good movie with a massive twist at the end which is totally unpredictable. The trailer is awful but the movie itself is very intelligent and entertaining!
I can’t believe I saw four out of five of these movies already 😂😂
I have not seen any of these movies! Lol but super happy when I saw Paul Wesley. Lol
you should definitely keep doing this series, theres a bunch of trailers out there to some of the weirdest and unsuccessful movies and it’s entertaining to make fun of them
It's a tumor on the pituitary gland, responsible for growth
HELLO I SAW AFTER WE COLLIDED TRAILER ON THERE YOU BETTER WATCH IT
Uh, Dylan, teenagers in 2020 aren't Millennials. Not that your point about generation gaps between writers and their intended audience isn't the same no matter what you call them, but just thought I'd mention it. I am a millennial and no matter how old we get people (media) keep using the term "Millennial" to mean "young person".   Don't sound like a boomer. 😂
please watch "the babysitter''
DYLAAAAAANNNNNNNN ... MISSED YOUUU (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
Actually, I’m more scared of armed intruders without masks than ones with masks. Because if they’re wearing a mask, it means they’re hiding their identity aka they don’t plan to kill me so they don’t want to be identifiable when they go, vs unmasked means they don’t care if you see their faces cause you won’t be a witness (cause you’ll be dead lmao)
Yes do more of these videos! Lol so funny.
Just so you all know Work It (2020) got an 81% on Rotten Tomatoes
Yes Dylan, this was fun and I enjoyed it very much. You should definetly make this into a series if you like it.
When you've watched "Keeping up with the Joneses" and actually liked it 😨
I watched hot summer nights and I couldn’t get through the first 30 minutes of the movie. It was so slow and uninteresting at all. I watched hot summer nights until I hated myself. Love you Dylan and keep up the content!!!💗💗💗
I loved this
Kinda embarrassed ngl because I actually really liked the keeping up with the Joneses movie lmao
jesus stefan really downgraded
I saw late bloomer twice and I would not recommend that on anyone.
That 100% came out of nowhere
Im so glad im not the only one who does this
Weirdly enough, the tinder movie is kinda good. I enjoyed it and was surprised at the end. I think you would probably like it, Dylan!
Love the idea Dylan! I hope you'll watch random trailers again.
The fact that I've heard of 4/5 of those movies and actually watched 2/5 of them. Dylan called me out on my shitty taste lol
Dylan just wants people to die in every movie 😂😂
It’s the tiktok sweater!!!🥰
Pretty much It watched Bad Match before
yes pls continue these videos, i need the serotonin king
Am i the only one who noticed that Stefan Salvatore from TVD was in late bloomer🤣
17:15 YES I DO . It's pretty creative to be honest ...
You’re funny. I like you. Thank you for your videos
did you mean Gen Z ain't no millenial a teenager buddy XD
Comment on jennifer body bc you were rude luv
yes yes please do this trailer review again
Where is that sweater from? I need it. Anybody know?
Dylan: I couldn’t think of a video idea so we’re watching trailers Us rats: 🥳👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣        Jk we love it 😊
Gosh, the best Groundhog Day like movie is Palm Springs.  It’s amazing!  Not a suggestion, I just thought of it after the first trailer
if you make another channel it should be called “DYLAN IS TROUBLED”
but like, what did you think of the hot summer nights trailer?? literally watched that movie last night bc i’m obsessed w lil timmy tim rn
WOAH WOAH WOAH did he just call JK Simmons C-list? Dylan I love you content but that's a major strike my guy. lol
Honestly I liked Keeping up with the Joneses, but I think it might have just been the cast
You should do this as a series and have each video do trailers from a different genre to compare them :)
Has anyone watched the Liza Koshy movie ? Is it worth it ? I was only gonna watch for Jordan Fisher
Tumour in his brain not penis.
I'm 38 and I say squirrel friend. It's hilarious!
dylan reminds me of an older aidan gallagher somehow
This felt like a dylan will not participate video
The Chillin Dylan I really want to recommend a movie so BADLY but I will respect his wishes. I love this though,  this would be a fun series!
Work it wasn’t that bad honestly😂
How do movies get such known actors and have such shitty scripts😂
ah ive seen the late bloomer,, it sucked from what i remember
So can we talk about where Dylan thinks the pituitary gland is
Hey, if you're looking for a good movie to watch I recommend "The Old Guard" and tell me if you like it or not.
"They're writing for what they think millenials want, don't let 40-years old write for teenagers!"  Well, the 40 year olds are technically the oldest millenials, teenagers are gen z.
React to magnificent century: kösem!!!!
I tried to watch The Late Bloomer. Emphasis on tried
i feel a copyright claim coming your way.
Hey work it is a much better movie than kissing booth !
LOVE this idea!
I actually loved Keeping Up With The Jones’s
Hi. Talk about the girl movie you were garabe in
Bad Match was actually really good. There is a surprise twist at the end
The girl in Bad match is basically a yandere
omg when dylan starts watching international/bollywood movies >>>>>>>>>
I saw the title of the video -  Nah it sounds boring but i might watch for Dylan 1 min into the vid Woah Dylan should really make more of this. I want more GODDAMMIT MORE !!!!!!!!!!!    I guess Dylan really can make anything interesting and fun to watch
bad match has a surprisingly good twist ending
Please watch "Work It" on Netflix lol It's so fucking cringy but I love it. And I love the actors
i feel so attacked when he hated the work it trailer but i cracked up so hard at some parts (and i'm a millenial)  does that mean im.... not cool?     fyi ik people are allowed different opinions so dont come for me thanks
AFTER WE COLLIDED 🙏💜
Legit got excited and sad when I saw Paul Wesley in Late Bloomer, now I’m gonna have to watch it
dylan you still use ''dog'' so yeah.....
It would be cool if you could watch trailers by like a theme or genre maybe you will get a mixed bag of good and bad trailers that way and see how they compare
Whiplash is a  movie not a short film,just correcting
Loveeee this video format, amazing idea Dylan! Cant wait to see more
Bad match really feels like a romcom somehow
how about watching the movie with the most shocking score in the movie commentary monday ?
1:32 so you’re saying you were a wattpad reader?
You didnt check the scores on the third trailer
the trailer titles are funnier than the entire movies
LOVING this concept. Hope you do more of these.
the fact ive seen 4/5 of these movies....(you got me with the last one)
wow I’m earlier then usual. anyways Dylan should do another reading comments.
it was a horrible day for me and dylan still mages to make me smile instantly ❤️ thank u for all the positivity u give us dylan ilysm ❤️❤️
0:27 *sees Dylan O’Brien* dylanception        I’m sorry
POV: you don’t have anything clever to comment on Dylan’s video because your not funny 👁👄👁
Can you please watch sonic the hedgehog?
Work it was actually okay. HOW DARE YOU-
Work it was actually okay. HOW DARE YOU-
can we meet at the chill zone again
I just finished my meditation. I'm still suprisingly early!
For premature I guessed 48% and I was right.
Yess more please
I'm sorry but I have to get this off my chest...I HAVE THE BIGGEST CRUSH ON YOU OMF
14:01 for the first time every I got the plot right
I need this to be a series
Yesterday i bought a bag of sour patch kids in hopes that you would upload soon. You did, and now i shall eat them in pride.
timothée chalamet
It’s kinda fun to find random movie trailers, once I found one for a movie based on a real story about an artist whose husband stole her work and claimed it as his own. It looked pretty good I guess but idk
who else wants dylan to watch euphoria
Totally Kyle?  Nah Totally Dylan
Dylan! Yes! You're back.
That's a really cool concept. I like it👍  (and I have actually seen marry Shelly🤔)
Holy shit im 2 movies in and I got the exact scores so far👁👄👁.. I guessed 48% AND 20% and they were both accurate
I thought Bad Match would be a comedy. Where the guy will be matched with a woman who might've robbed a bank or is on the run from the police. She somehow had the time for a date and then the guy gets strung along with her and stuff. I don't know if this is a better idea tho.
Lets hope there was a either a glitch that turned. 001%, to 100%. Either that or money really can buy .. . .almost everything I guess. Another vid like this would be awesome!
not 100% 😭😭 lmaooo
Movies can have a garbage trailer and still be really good. Movies can have an amazing trailer and be total garbage.
Im pretty sure PrettyMuchIt did a video on Bad Match
I feel like it’d be cool if at one point you like do movie trailers for a specific genre like one episode can be all about horror movies and another can be action movies :) overall I would want to see more of this cause it was fun guess along to it
Girl: I'm a pisces we like the most compatible match   Me: YES! FINALLY WE GET MENTIONED! PISCES HAVE BEEN METIONED!  She's a psychopath  Me: well......... kinda true
Work it would have been good if they did more character development and if they didn't rush the plot so much... it wasn't completely terrible.... it just wasn't as good as it could be.
Do work it pleaseeee
100%?!?!?!?!?!
Fun format. I like movie commentaries better, but I wouldn't mind more of these either
Unrelated but that shirt is cool !
I love this video idea, it was fun to guess along with you 😝
I remember people saying bad match had a really good twist in it. Might watch.
Chillin' with Dylan, lets go
Has anyone notice how all these trailers have the same obnoxious music?
So are we going to get a Bad Match video?
I saw the movie Premature, it was kinda funny tbh
"I can't believe they just *sucked it up* "  😳😳😜
"Top or bottom make your choice" 😆😂
watch desperados on netflix!
Would you ever watch musical trailers?
🦕
"he had a tumour in his penis..." ummm, no... in his brain, against the pituitary gland... in the brain lol
It's the "100% rating for a try-hard, wannabe thriller movie" for me  👁👄👁
Petition for Dylan to do an MCM on one of these
This is a great video concept. Please do more like this.
Dylan needs to watch the whole Whiplash film, it’s not just a short film
who’s going to tell dylan that the pituitary gland is actually located in the brain
dylan watch outer banks
Love this !
These seem like movies my aunt would watch
Okay but that last one's score...how?
This video has class; definitely make it into a series!
Why did the Netflix trailer make me cringe most of all?
Can u watch work it on Netflix pls😚
Am I the only person who has watched ‘Bad Match’?
now i need to know how that possibly got a 100%
the sad thing is i've watched all these movies.
This video was actually really funny (not like that's a surprise it's Dylan) but seeing him watch all these random trailers is hilarious
Please watch Upside Down Magic on Disney Channel PLEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Omgg Paul Wesly 😆😆😆
Pwease continue this series
so you have to watch bad match now
This is a prayer to god (not a recommendation) that Dylan does instant family or blockers for his next movie commentary
this was kinda fun, if you wanna you could do more
Dylan can you please do a reaction video of Harry Styles's second album "Fine Line"?? 💜💜
Haha literally guessed 38% for the first one too 😂
Millennials are 40
Im preparing my backpack while watching this, i start school on monday  (August 17th)
That last one was rigged. Obvs. No movie has a 100% on the 🍅 tomato meter! And with the audience score of 42? Naw, something's fishy there...
I actually liked Work It...
This was great idea. Looking forward to the next one!
Most people have probably heard of Keeping up with the joneses tho
but now you have to call this series chillin' with dylan
i love this idea and you should totally make it a series
I definitely saw the late bloomer!!! And I definitely saw keeping up with the Joneses ... and I didn't remember any of it...
bad match is actually really good! pretty much it did a commentary on it a while back
Anyone else early but doesn’t know what to comment?😂
I have watched The Late Bloomer and I only remembered halfway through the trailer... So that's how rememberable it is
I actually liked Work It, it was just fun, cheesy, and dumb, a good movie to watch wit a friend
dylan you better get back to disney movie commentaries because it's the only thing that brought joy into my life. thank you.
_how in the world did "bad match" get 100%??_
Omg!! He did the “toodles!!”
Oh Pool guy from Greener grass
Bad Match is actually pretty good.
Okay but Bad Match is actually kinda good, the trailer kinda is shit though
the CHILL ZONE :D any Watcher fans??
Trailor: girl attempts to stab and murder man numerous times, frames him for a serious federal offense and ruins life from the ground up Dylan: THATS NOT SCARY  😂😂😂 love you Dylan haha💕
I think i watched bad match and basically she's crazy and he kills her but the cops find him covered in blood and a knife.
I haven't watched "Bad Match" yet, but i heard good things about it, so i wasn't surprised about the rating.
I liked this
these are your typical *white* movies, that's why they all suck lmao
it was the 100% for me 💀
Dylan has to watch that last movie so we can see if it’s actually 100%
11:09 Dylan: Are the Joneses like... Me: swingers. Dylan: spies? Me: oh.
Just here to say I think he looks like bbno$, carry on with your day
Oh my gosh yes please make this a series and do other videos like this. This was freaking awesome and the cringe was too strong! Funny as fuck
So the reason the last one had 100% is probably cos theres a huuuuge twist i remember PMI did a commentary on it i think
*Um yeah so who’s gonna tell Dylan the teenagers nowadays aren’t millennials anymore 👀*
I literally do this when I'm bored, just scroll through random trailers that look dumb and wonder what im doing with my life
If Dylan says the pituitary gland is in the penis then the pituitary gland is in the penis.
BEFORE Y’ALL START TO COMMENT “Dylan wat-“ SHUT UP. BECAUSE YOU’LL RECOMMEND SOMETHING AWESOME AND OUT OF SPITE HE WONT WATCH IT. And I wanna see him watch the awesome stuff, too so please don’t recommend anything 😭
since everyone is just quoting the video and not answering the question, i guess i will...   yes, dylan. do more of these
I've seen Keeping Up the Joneses which was funny. There's one movie I saw a trailer of like Groundhog Day mixed with horror comedy called Happy Death Day. I didn't watch the whole movie
If you haven’t done a movie commentary on Shrek 2 then you need to get on that!  You won’t be disappointed, I guarantee!
I refuse to believe the last trailer received that score
Me trying to make a good comment: 👁👄👁
keeping up with the joneses i actually liked
I've actually seen that last movie and it was decent but not 100% decent
Chill zooneee
This is the earliest I've been to any of his videos.
Wait lmaoooo why is is 100% 😭😂
Helloo
guys... he's just chillin
“Vampire Diaries Guy”💀
I watched Bad Match, it's pretty bad, don't watch it.
I swear keeping up with the Joneses wasn't that bad, it has been a few years tho...
Kid flash is in that movie wow his career is going down hill
0:57 omg when I saw After we collided I was PRAYING he’d watch it 😂😭 I’m excited for when he hopefully watches it so sad boi can turn into mad boi
I've seen The Late Bloomer and I remember it being based on an actual guy's life.
Dylan : these movies are trash. who's actually watched this shit Me *having watches AND liked all of them* : yeah right only garbage people have watched these shitty movies
Somehow I have watched Premature and bad match years ago before ever seeing the trailer lol and Bad match was a really good movie imo tho
Okay, news flash Dylan millennials are no longer teenagers. I’m gen z (sadly) and I’m 20. The reason u, a millennial find this cringey is because you ain’t the target audience.  Wow, rereading and hearing the tone, don’t take it harsh...huge fan and I’m just being honest/blunt.
Lol I saw premature it was funny but annoying
Work It was SURPRISINGLY good, anything is better than the kissing booth 😒 Hope you react to it 🙏🏽
Maybe one day you could do a Chill Zone where you react to international movie trailers?? Like from Europe or Asia, not just straight up all in English movies??
well done dylan, now i want you to watch Bad Match, but i am not allowed to recommend it. Does it count if you came up with it by yourself?
Just wanna recommend a trailer. It's whatever you wanna watch
Doctor: you have a tumor on your pituitary gland Dylan: he had a tumor on his PENIS ...that is not how anatomy works
I'm surprised Dylan knew Paul Wesley ( Stefan from the vampire diaries)
Me, sadly waiting for star wars reaction videos  😢😔
I always get caught up in the never ending indie trailers. But I usually go for the horror, thriller, weird, romcom trailers.
This is amazing! Please please please do a part 2!!!
tryna figure out why I didn't get notification for this video.
Love it!!
10:10 In those movies they always get bad dancers then 1 good dancer that always become the love  interest 13:19 I said 38
In the first trailer is that the emo kid from Tracy beaker
If we cant comment the movie can we comment a year? Then you watch trailers in the certain year?
I LOVED this jsjsj
0:57 i see after we collided trailer there 👀👀
This is friggin hilarious! Definitely make this a series😌
Pretty Much It reacted to Bad Match and that ending was WILD
I loved this idea :3 Maybe do 5 from each year?  This was obviously 2016 "highlights" xD
Just want to say I’ve recently been going through a hard time, and I’ve started to rewatch your entire channel again. It’s really been a lifesaver, thank you
work it wasn't bad 😭😭
To up the stakes, why not do a commentary on the movie you had the worst guess for? I'd watch the hell out of that! 😂😂
work it is a feel good comfy movie actually
I was just re-bingeing your videos before this dropped lol
Can we stop pretending Liza is funny? Parents! Stop! Being obnoxious stops being funny after 10 - don't support this shit.
Dylan thinking the pituitary gland is in the penis 😂 dude he had a tumor in his brain
There’s a movie, it’s relatively new called The Beach House, the trailer looked pretty good, watched it, one of the WORST movies I’ve ever seen. The tomatometer was 81%😂😂
movie commentary monday for spiderman into the spidervearse!
I think you mean gen z not millennials lol
Yes do more
It wll be interesting if you watch Euphoria
Just finished watching. Definitely do it again! 🤣😅   Is it bad that I've heard of most of them? To be clear- I haven't SEEN them.
I watched premature when I was twelve I barely remember it except for I heard the song tounge tied by grouplove for the first time in that movie🌼🌼🌼oh I've also seen bad match it was trash
hi dylan im a troublemaker and 33 mins early? whats my prize
Only movie I've watched in this was Keeping Up with the Joneses. I am in the 30% crew. Even though I laughed a lot during it. It was I am stupid, watching a stupid movie and watching Gal Gadot and drooling.
Okay but can we talk about the lighting in the back and the color combination
I kinda wish this video was a little longer. There's something quite enjoyable listening to you talk about random trailers.
please watch work it ❤️
I honestly really liked work it it was really fun it reminded me of pitch perfect
I like this new video idea! It's pretty interesting and I never thought of someone doing that before but it's cool. I'm always asking friends if they have seen a movie trailer and what their opinion is on it but I never see Youtuber do it so I'm glad you decided to do this! Keep it up and thanks for the great content!
React to the After We Collided trailer.
Dylan! yey!
I knew as soon as i heard Liza Koshy i knew that movie was gonna be bad
I love this series Dylan!! I’d totally watch more ❤️
This was such a good time. Definitely recommend you do it again!
but am i the only one that saw "premature"??? HAHHAHA  yes, yes i am depressed.
Dylan, you should do a series reacting to kdrama trailers. Kdramas are actually so much more interesting and funny than american tv you should give it a try!!
hell yeah we stan sue sylvester
Dylan: Noone's ever heard of these movies. Me, who's heard of all of these movies: ...
Love falling down the movie trailer rabbit hole. Do I ever watch the movies I see the trailers for? no. But it’s fun
chillin' dylan (di-‘lin’)
Yes continue the movie trailer videos✨
It's crazy how much I like it when he says toodles🤷
Actually work it was pretty good. It's kinda cringey but i liked it
oh my god I gagged watching the Netflix movie I want my time back please
Okay, so I actually enjoyed keeping up with the joneses...but 20%??
Chilling dylan
i loves this type of video it’s so fun and creative!
Guess im early
I thought I’d just remind you that Stranger Things season three is out now
You said what they think millenials want. But you then said 40 year old writers writing for teens. Bruh teens are gen z not millenials in current day.
that background really be vibing tho
Personally, I think keeping up with the Jones’s is really good lol
Dylan looking for movie ideas while making a video
Somehow every time I see a new video by Dylan I have to click
I know you dont take suggestions.. but im just saying... the movie hush on netflix.. is pretty good... just saying. just to reiterate.. not a suggestion.. & also not for the trailer series
embarrassed to say ive seen all but one of these movies
I'm sure the ratings on Bad Match have to have been done ironically. Please.
Like the new format, since I sometimes just watch trailers for hours, but I never actually watch the movies. Cause I ain’t got no time 🤷‍♂️ And like this my leisure time is even part of a game 😎
hi
Dylan: *drops a video*  Everyone: DROP EVERYTHING AND GRAB YOUR SOUR PATCH KIDS.
Dylan: who would watch this? Me: has seen two of these movies 👁👄👁
Did he just say vagina jab? I can't-
does - does Dylan think teenagers are millennials?
i wish i had something funny to comment but i am just fangirling over dylan
Can you react to the actual Eurovision song contest or maybe the movie
I love this video idea  Part 2 plssss
Fun fact: Pretty Much It actually reacted to Bad Match. How they watched that whole film I don't know
Dylan’s face of disappointment throughout the Work It trailer is too good 😂😂
imagine the amount of animated movies that are so bad you can't get through the trailers.
I'm mad at myself for knowing and watching most of these Lmao
damn if these trails have like 5mil views each what do movie trailers with less then 1mil look like lol
I love the summer shirt Dylan 😁
I saw The Late Bloomer a long time ago. Don't remember a thing. 2016 was a bad year for movies apparently, but we collectively as a society blocked that out.
its a chill video indeed
Why are you not in CIRCLE???
I went and watched Keeping Up With The Joneses in the movie theater. I didn’t think it was that bad. It wasn’t that great, but it wasn’t terrible.
A random comment
ok but when u guessed the score of the first one i said 38 and then u said 38 and i was like “what?”
Whichever is the lowest Dylan should have to watch lol
I would watch more videos like this! And maybe after that you can watch the full movie of the trailer you watch. That Bad Match seems like a good video material 👀
I guessed 48% exactly  i am a psychic
Love the top and the setting
Is "toodles" back officially?
Petition for Dylan to make this into a series 👇🏼
I rated everything way higher than it was, guess I really am just a stinky rat boy
Dylan on Tinder "You wanna come by the Chill Zone... it's chill vibes"
I need to know why Bad Match has 100% wtf
Yes please do more like this because I’m stuck in bed with a broken ankle and I can’t find anything to watch plus all I’m watching is supernatural and a tv series called Stella with Ruth Jones
But how did the bad match get 100% I am CoNFuSiOn
i watched Work It yesterday, and it wasn't the best movie, but the acting was ok, I also really liked the cast. I had an enjoyable time watching it lol
Ha for the first movie I guessed 42! It's kind of sad I got happy about that....
Please make this a series!
I actually like Keeping up with the Joneses 😂
I got so happy when Dylan knew Stefan from the vampire diaries, imagine a commentary to that 💀
I like bad match
Dylan - “audiences are rats. they’ll eat trash” Us, his audience - 👁👄👁
Dylan needs to watch bad match now. *but for legal reasons this is not a suggestion*
Me: *giggles* Dylan: that’s not funny Me: i know......😔
Dylan: that wasn't funny  Also Dylan: Heh Heh
Keeping up with the Joneses reminds me of the horrible knockoff  of spy kids, (Spy Kids, all the time in the world.)
imagine some ppl will know this as a groundhog day situation others will know it as a happy death day kinda situation lol
Dylan‘s giving off the vibe of a distinguished young professor from the 90s. He looks like a side character in Good Will Hunting and I absolutely love it.
"Tinder Dating Thriller"  Dylan: OH I didn't think it would go horror!
Stefan Salvatore???
I think you should do this series and then watch the movie that gets the best score.
Would you ever react to Anime movies?
Yayyyyy Dylan posted!
He didn.t do After We collided😭
I don’t actually watch movies I watch Dylan watch movies. Now I don’t need to watch trailers either 😬
Dylan is not amused, like, at all 😂😂
I like this style of video, and there's a lot of good, I could say about the actual video, but can we just appreciate how coordinated and pretty the lighting and shirt was? Idk why, but I found it nice to look at
ThANK GOd! Just come home from a sh*tty day at work, needed a good ol' Dylan vid
I literally haven't heard of any of those movies
keeping up with the joneses isn't THA bad!
Omg where’s that sweater from please
i had to choose between this and pewdiepie i apologize dylan, but i chose the king
Trailer Title - “Tinder Dating THRILLER”  Dylan - “i didn’t expect this to go horror”
Damn, that last trailer had the biggest plot twist rating
STEFAN SALVATORE !!!!!
yes
Work it was actually so good ngl
Hi sir
Now that he's watched the work it trailer it only seems right that he watch work it. Not a suggestion, just an observation
Dylan, you cut the Toodles 😭
Who's seen Work it raise your hand 👀✋
dylan: reads the video title which says "thriller"  also dylan: i didn't think this would go horror
I saw the trailer for Bad match and the new netflix movie otherwise no Idea what the others are
Why do people think Liza Koshy is funny? She's not she's cringe.
I watched “Work It” and it was actually surprisingly decent for what it is 😅
I like this idea
i love this video format hell fuckin ye
Who’s here after 20 minutes of him posting this video?
I'd watch this series
you know when rotten tomatoes give it 100% its pure shit but its like woke or something so it gets 100%
6:00 PAUL WESLEY🤧🤧😍
You can tell it’s a chill zone by his chill hair
Please do a reaction about attack on titan s4 trailer 💗💗
It's so satisfying to be early and see 0 dislikes
OMG I've seen work it and it is soooooo bad it hurts
No one: Dylan, 7:31: EwUuH
okay but dylan when are you going to write a teen movie... or any movie. i fully trust you to write a cringe-free script. also i can't stand the 'groundhog day' trope but one movie that honestly did alright with it was 'happy death day', it was different/funny enough to be pretty entertaining.
So Bad Match is basicly The Last Jedi
work it wasn't that bad, but maybe that was because of jordan fisher and sabrina carpenter
If you do this next time... Also try to guess the plot from the trailer and then cross check with the description
14:02  Bad Pair
Nah I don't like rotten tomatoes. I use letterboxd and Bad Match has a score of 2.5 out of 5 ⭐
You should totally do a movie commentary on Kung Fu Panda... that would be hilarious
More
Pov: you haven't finished the video yet and are thinking "I wish I wrote that" seeing the top comments
Most unbothered king ever
100% ?? Is that even possible. 😂I've never seen that rating before.
Work it was actually really good
Was that Stefan from The Vampire Diaries??
Omg I actually used to do this, sometimes for hours. It's so funny to watch those bad trailers😂
I can't focus on the video because DYLAN IS SO CUTE
“I didn’t think this was gonna go horror” *the trailer literally has thriller in the title dylan*
You were so close to After We Collided
work it actually wasn’t that bad. way better than the kissing booth, but isn’t everything?
I didn't know I needed this
i will be pissed if this doesnt turn into a series
Dylan: gives bad match a 15% Me: gives bad match a 17%      Dylan and I: 100%??!!!
idc what anyone says about 'work it', it was so much fun to watch (it just seemed like it was a lot of fun to film) and to me Sabrina Carpenter & Jordan Fisher had rly good chemistry   (i exempt the whole Lisa Koshy/Matress Store guy plot, that was just cringey and borderline creepy)
Bad Match was actually not all that Bad lmao only cause it has a Twist most people don’t see coming 😂😂💀
how the hell does bad match have a %100 i- i’ve seen it and it’s not bad but like.......%100??? no fucking way
2K likes no dislikes... we love to see it
When you actually watched Late Bloomer already....
I haven’t even finished the video but the fact that I’ve watched the first 2 movies is😬😂
Top or bottom, make your choice
Unique video! I love it x
Bro I apparently have to watch Bad Match now because it's SO GOOD
The worst movie gets 100% 😂
This is an awesome idea for a series! It's really fun to laugh at these crappy trailers and guess along with you 😅
Work It has an 80% on rotting tomatoes soooo
Do AFTER WE COLLIEDED trailer
🙌🏻🙌🏻
Keeping up with the joneses was actually a fun movie 🗿
Do people still make book trailers? I remember them being horrific
STEFAN SALVATORE
Ah, no dislikes, perfectly balanced as things should be.
His fashion sense calls me boring in like 5 different languages.
I watched Work It over the weekend, and I actually really enjoyed it. The trailer is trash though, they really threw in every cringy joke in the movie 🤦
Work it: GREAT cast, BAD script
Me: Laughing  Dylan: That's not funny Me: Yeah, that's not funny
This sweater is ugly I love it
Oh, this is new. Sooo many comments 😱 And nobody has watched the video through the end yet
there wasn't enough budget for late night dylan--
Im going to watch work it simply for jordan fisher.
Dylan, I love ya, truly I do...but they straight up said the tumor was in his BRAIN! The pituitary gland is in your head not your penis...
“here’s the thing about trust, once it’s gone..it’s bad”
I LOVE U
Watch bad match it is good
Just realized the guy crying in the first trailer was Alan Tudyk, I love that guy
Actually if you were to actually watch work it, the movie is a lot better than the trailer they put the most cringe parts in the trailer but most everything else is actually pretty good I think
Dylan watching trailers is basically me during quarantine
I haven’t been this early yay 💕😌
Whoever reading this comment you are beautiful and amazing ❤ Stay safe!
When you are early but you don't know what to comment: 👁️👄👁️
Dylan you should make a movie commentary about cloud 9 ;)
Mate, I've never been this early!
i could never imagine stefan in a shitty comedy 😐😐😐
The tumor was in his brain not his penis lol
React to black king or Hamilton
Dylan, you know what you should watch?    Whatever you want
Wooooo late night Dylannnnnn, haha haven’t even watched mos RIF the video yet lol
Wow no dislikes. Now that's an accomplishment 🥳  Nevermind 😐
I may or may not have seen all of these movies a few times
Work it is literally a ripoff version of step up 2 with a somewhat different story... you can’t convince me otherwise
chill zone 🤪
I’m so chill I be the freezer 🥶😶
I totally forgot I saw keeping up with the joneses
I've literally been binging Dylan's episode videos lately and now he finally uploadedddd :))))
when there’s no dislikes😌
I am triggered because he didn't watch After 2's trailer.
You should react to game plan or 365 days 💀👀👀
I watched work it yesterday and I found so many things that Dylan would hate in the movie 😂😂😂😂
Did... did you just called us millennials? Old man... we ARE gen Z
I love the fact that Dylan thinks the pituitary gland is in the penis and not the brain 😂
Did i see stefan salvatore?
"Work it" was actually really good tho. Watched it last night n I enjoyed it
The Late Bloomer was such a terrible movie. I only watched it because Paul Wesley was in it
Bio
"Audiences are rats. They will eat trash." - Dylan
We chilling 😎
you mean zoomers. Millenials are all adults in their mid 20s to late 30s.
I didn’t know I needed this video until now
AAAA IM EARLY
Dylan is the only reason I still open the YouTube app now a days
So... we're Chillin with Dylan? Hehehe... I'll see myself out.
You can clearly see how confused Dylan is while watching these trailers.
Not a bad video concept
This is such an interesting video idea, I already love this! 🥺❤️
Ummm did Dylan just say the main guy in the second movie had a penis tumor...pretty sure it's brain tumor buddy....😂😂
When you have actually seen one of the movies, but it was so horrible, that you can’t remember even one of the plot points
You should do a reaction to after we collided trailer!!!!
oh I watched like almost half the video and am just now realizing that it came out literally like 7 minutes ago...  😅🤦🏽‍♀️
Dylan saying “stop with the sex jokes”? What’s going on here?
Hey dude
DYLAN WATCH THE "AFTER WE COLLIDED" TRAILER....plllllsss!!!🖤
I feel like sometimes big actors choose crap movies on purpose just to have fun and enjoy themselves
Yes.
The pituitary gland is not in the penis, Dylan 😂🤣
does Dylan know that there is a short clip about the wedding from Flynn and Rapunzel?
I have seen Premature
Please can you react to  The Invisible Man directed by Leigh Whannel pleeeease ?!
Ik you probably won’t see this but I just wanna let you know that I love this video concept :)
Thank goddd I’ve been rewatching everything else 🥴
i love this shirt
Dylan just watching the late bloomer trailer Me: OMG STEFAN SALVATORE
“A tumor in his penis” DYLAN NOOOO ITS IN HIS BRAIN
Omg I've actually seen The Late Bloomer
idk why he gives me Joel Kinnaman vibes. got that swedish viking height too lmao
You should watch 3 men and a baby, Doctor Dolittle live action, and a bad 80s movie called poltergeist. Please like so he will see this. Ps I love your videos
Paul Wesley!!!
Our king Flynn is creating a new content. I loved it!
Dylan should react to euphoria one day, what do you guys think?
The last time I was this early Dylan was still trying to make sanitary a thing
why dont you do kids tv shows thats what i watch when im bored
dylan looks like flynn rider more than flynn rider
It physically pains me to say that I’ve voluntarily watched all of these movies prior to this video
The way i screamed when i saw he uploaded. This man has my whole heart😭
The awkward moment when you were binging movie trailers right before he posted...
Last time i am this early, sanitary is still a thing
way too early
i never clicked a notification so fast-
I have actually seen the trailer for the second one💪🏼
1k likes and *0 dislikes* 😱  Anyway, can you do a monday commentary on The Invisible Man (2020) directed by Leigh Whannel
i had just prepared myself some meal and was wondering what to watch while eating. thank you this is the best notification i ever had
why does he look more and more like flynn rider every video
your videos are the funniest! thanks for making them.
haven’t seen the video, but i like the idea
wait i’m too tired to be funny
Last time I was this early, Dylan was still trying to make sanitary a thing. Jk, I've never been this early. 😂
i spend my whole days watching trailers and not watching the movies so like some of you don’t actually do that??????
It's nice to see you using your incredible predicting abilities 😂
The vibes 😂🥳
I love you
Is that a sweater he bought during the shopping video with Misoa 😍😍
Cust jillin
Great, was just thinking ‘bout you.
i have never been this early
I’m so early so all I have to say right now is that I love you 💕
yayyy dylan posted, loved the ideia!!
That kiss look so uncomfortable. Like is she kissing with her teeth?
lets goo
"The Chill Zone" got me dying I don't even know why, like are you some drug dealer trying to lure us with those night lightings 🤣
What you look like reading the comments 🧿👄🧿
Hi Dylan!😁
I haven't watched yet but I already like the video
May I just say that the Troublemakers are genuinely the chillest funniest community on yt
i think this is the earliest i've ever been to a dylan video oof
late night dylan! yes finally!! never have I been this early
dylan we want the book your promised us a decade ago
Ya should definitely watch The Hobbit -trilogy mate, been waiting for it since The Lord of the Rings -trilogy ya watched ;)
“I was sad, because I didn’t have a video,” -  Dylan, 2020
Wooaaah why am I so early 😳
I'm sorry but the first time omfg yes
I love this original content 😍
Never clicked so fast on a video ever!!
Hey I recommend you to whach licufer  from Netflix
You should react to the movie Work it with sabrina carpenter
This is serendipitous, Dylan the biggest OC fan ever posts just as I begin to watch the OC for the first time ever....because of how much he has mentioned it XD  So far so good!  We may not be able to give Dylan recomendations, but he definitely should give us some! x
I never thought I’d vibe with a middle part
I LOVEEEEEE premature, it was on Netflix but they took it off. It's a good movie tho I promise...I've literally watched all of these movies
Excited for some bad trailers
React to black is king by beyonce
The "background" is now just so beautiful and amazing. Y'all remember how it was years ago?
is that original content?!! bb im so proud
i was about to watch it but i have to leave😭😭
dylan's small laugh makes me smile for no reason at all
Stay Sexy Dylan
I’m in a zoom meeting but Dylan posted so I guess I have connection issues for the next 18 minutes
Hi Dylan! I'm gonna watch this vid on my birthday on Wednesday!  (A random piece of information I thought I'd share lol)
Totally love the video Dylan  cuz I’ve definitely watched it right now even though the vid came out like 2 minutes ago o-o
Dylan, I love you. Thank you so much for being the light of my day. Ive been going through so much stress, watching your videos gives me the laughs and love that keeps me going.
dylan being into tiktok drama is one of the most surprising things i’ve heard 😺
I just wanted to comment so... Yeah, I did bye!

DOOOOOG WE MISSED U🥺🥺🥺
YAY ILY DYLAN

How would Dylan rate me  I wanna know
anyone else reached that point where they’ve watched all of dylan’s videos at least three times and no longer know what to do with their time
Eu vim mais rapido que o dylan falando que alguem tem que morrer no filme
But I’m not chilling, Dylan, I’m frigging boiling in this 38C/100 F degree weather
