We all have one friend who can't manage their cables 🤮 If you like my Shorts, do consider checking out my Main Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Mrwhosetheboss
Song name?
The problem is all my cables are different lengths!! Some have more slack than others.
Thanks for these tips, cable ties work amazing for wires and I never knew I needed them
Tbh im not planning to buy anything just all diy
If you guys wants any of the product shown in the video contact me
Im sending this to myself…
Dont look behind the tv in my living room
Enters the server rack
You either have a nightmare to see or a nightmare to troubleshoot
Great suggestions
Are you from India? Cool stuff
I sent it to my self😂
North waziristan
I have a L shaped desk so I got two power bars and I used double sided tape to tape them on both sides under the desk and I also use cable hookd
Also maybe the most important rule, LABEL all the cables at BOTH ENDS! That is a time and nerve saver whenever you do cable management, something malfunctions or you are moving.
they’re not called cable ties are called zip ties😡🤬
What if your chargers are kept in the drawer? How to keep it neat and tidy? (sorry I am very basic cuz I'm Singaporean)
Bold of you to think I need to send this to someone
Lego
dont put the cable around your neck you might get radiation only if it its on
When my parents bought the house there was already an ethernet cable through the wall from the router spot to the desk spot
Only issue is when the device fails - u have to cut all the the zip ties, not fun. 🤩. Tagging the wires with labels will help somewhat.
Can you like merge cables? I dont have enough outlets for all my stuff.
that magnetic cable thing is trash shit be attaching to it and its annoying af
The last one is literally my lifesaver 😂❤
You can also use lego minified hand and and stick it to  a lego baseplate and make the minified hold the cable from ther hands
Use wireless and bluetooth accessories
Mrwhosetheboss: Send this to someone on need.  Me: Attempting to send to myself😂😂
@MrwhosethebossShorts You Can Also Use a 3 in 1 USB A Cable
Or just go wireless
never realized how far you've come
Never use a cable tie to put the electric cable together. It's dangerous and can cause fire.
That's my name
I did that first one now i have one massive cable
I need the cable tidy boxes!!!
5: try not to look at them
(Arun) use a tidy box (me) makes it homemade.
Nah I just use sellotape…
Thanks dude
“Send this to someone in need” Sir, I already watched the video.
Nahh easy if its ling cut and connect the wire back and ots short and easy for usb cut off the long one if is the data one connect all color wire with the for 250v one its has 3 or 2 same as the usb easy and better its saving money free dealing with cable's
If one cable is 1cm off it’s line I will redo everything and not stop until it’s perfect.
No we don't have cables all around our neck and on the floor.
People who had to send it to themselves (I am one of them) 👇
Or you could drill a power bar into your desk
1 spiral cable holder
tying all your cables together is a disaster waiting to happen. god forbid you need to change or add a connection
DO NOT USE CABLE TIES! It’s a nightmare if you’re trying to move something. Use velcro ties
cats and rabbits: ima ruin this man whole carrer
Me "send this to my ALT account"
Easy. Don't care about it
My gaming setup has a lot of cables, but i dont care because their always pluged in
My room is filled with cables in one place, and I don’t even know where to put them🥲
This clip is gamers dream for sure 👍🏼👍🏼
i have 10 cables running from my Pc behind the monitors, they are put together with velcro ties
I dont think i have ever had a nightmare about cables
i honestly dont care. it makes my room look more alive.
my cable night mare is the huge box I have of obsolete cables!
Please. Do. Never. Ever use these "tidy-boxes". Power Adapters can produce a ton of heat and can cause fire if held in such a box.
Are you from India?
I just put 2 flags on the back of my desk so all my cables are hidden between the flags and the wall.
my compute cluster is an absolute mess... i invested in about 500 zipties for this ikea shelf that i an abusing as a server rack aaaand... even after managing all.the cables for 2days straight it's still a mess. To anyone experienced in managing a ton of wires: is there anything other than cable channel, zipties and velcro that i can zry?
I literally send that to myself😂
I love cables hanging around my room and pc, looks sick 💀
You know what is actually another thing that you feel I could get in the Willy good waps in the Game of Thrones they stick to each other and it's really good it's really easy and doesn't cost that much
Him: Send this to someone in need  *Sends it to myself*
Arun got cable rizz 💀
Helped me a lot. Thx
I deal with cable mess like it's not even there, zip tie-ing them together is just a no from me
I need this!
Don’t use classic cable ties. Instead use some Velcro strips. This way you can easily open, extend, remove and close the tidied up Cables without the need of scissors and new cable ties
I just got a cable tray that clamps to my desk and its one of the best things I've bought
Cable tie😅 but what if you need to unplug or short-circuit
this is fake. There's no rick roll
Or you could use a Razer bungee cord (by the way this is for wired mice and is a joke)
Or use rubber band
The real problem is my earphone mesh
If you're really desperate then just use scissors 😃
Or just deal with it
How many devices do you have and please if you have any extra that you are not using please can you please send it to me please I am begging 🙏
cringe content
Get a 3d printer and embrace the pain with it
I think we are all in need 😅

Bgm: 💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺👯👯💃🕺👯
Standby for wireless transfer of energy. It will be done around 2050.
Was this a ad?
I'm disappointed @MrwhosethebossShorts. You shouldn't use cable ties. Just more one use plastic waste. You should be asking your followers to use velcro strips cut to length.
fatta
Mrwhosetheboss ur literally the first person I ever subscribed to your video on the nothing phone 2 is what made me buy it instead of the 14 pro max and I will never regret that decision
RRR
@Konstantin wants to know your location😊
We are not in 2017
Can you send it to yourself
Wow
I don't get what the tidy box is for
Having a 3 pad wireless charger helps too
Use Velcro instead of cable ties
Instead of fidgit cables we can have self retracting cables
"use cable ties to ZELDA them together" (yes I am aware I am addicted to totk and Skyward sword (no I won't write it's first letters only))
Bro explained his struggles well under 2 mins lol
This really improved my setup.
Please don’t use zip ties to manage your cables. They are very hard to remove when chasing the configuration of your cables. Get Velcro ties or use bread ties.
Really useful❤
link for this fidget cable?
Nah man I love having cables laying around
Can I send this to myself?😅😅

I want to use Fidget cable but my siblings will take out all magnets from it.
Also one trick: Try craming cables as much as possible
whoever invented cables is an asshole. but also a genius
Did you just use a zip tie on your cables? I would recommend NOT doing that ever.
He forgot to rickroll us
So their is no solution 🥲
We dont have plugs on the floor... but we did, back in the 90s!
As soon as my baby comes the first thing before learning how to walk is of course CABLE MANAGEMENT
Background music anyone??
bro looks like a bootleg ali abdaal
so you have 2 plugs and so you get a huge white brick 💀
First of all, those are not cable ties. Those are zip ties. Second of all, you should use Velcro straps instead of zip ties.
the waffle house has found its new host
I guess tape can be used to combine all the cables
Haha when you lie cables next to each other it creates opposite flow between the cables .. Like you never use a rolled up cable .... If the boss didnt know this he aint no boss of mine hes a muggle...
The Waffle House has found it's new host
Or 5 I don't give a shit.
Or just don't use cables
@pokimane
Pro tip , just don't look at them
BRO not zip ties those eventually damage the cords with the corse plastic
instead of cable ties use rubber bands
all my cables and cords are literally just dangling from my rafters in my room like all of them so I won't use the clean technique for my cables
Or just dont use kabels
Gay
or just put them somewhere you can't see them and look at the fireworks!
Use wireless

Never put cables in the same direction as they will act as a transformer  do such as long as the cables have magnetic isolation certification
You: send this to someone that need this Me: how do I send it to myself

I love cables and all this mess with them. 😀😀
E: use all of them
i actually lack cables  i only have to deal with a charger and a earphone 😁
True UK plugs are just design dissaster
Are you sure putting a bunch of cables with magnets on them together would solve tangling?
You mean cable ties can tie cables? Ingenious!

Thank you! Now my cables are not tangled up anymore and it's now organized. In this case, I am the friend who needs this.
Don’t use a cable tie because if you want to change something you will have to cut it off maybe use a Velcro cable strap instead.

I'm glad I can use my Samsung cable for 4 different things

Who would have thought that you can use cableties to tie cables  OK jokes aside pretty hod tips, thanks.
Why ur eyes always blink beginning of all videos 🧐
How do I send this to myself
My cousin has a fidget cable
Wouldn’t recommend cable tying a lot of cables together. It can cause a lot of heat and melt the cable insulation or a fire
dont cabletie network cable and power cable together there my addition
I have the magnet charger
I thought he said tables at first
Ocd
We indians can’t afford this phancy things (no hate to India (
Hii
Or just act like a normal person and don't fucking worry about it.
I will go one cable only,instead
Or burn the cables
When he says to people in need does he mean poor people
Um 😳😳😳😳
Instead of using a permanent solution that you cant undo use a piece of wire instead!
Poke main needs this lol

Dont. Use. Cable. Ties. The moment you want/need to change or replace on bit or something gets messed up or you want to move your set you will have a lot of broken ties and it’s annoying. Just use Velcros and don’t buy wierd plastic boxes for 20$… (you know.. dust and stuff)
Geeze l, never use ties. Use velcro instead for God sake.

You can give me the iPhone 13 or Samsung S22 instead of breaking them
Hey, placing cables parallel to each other, if they are copper, can lead to interference if they carry data, so is not recommended
Tysm.

Very informative. I have not 1 but, two sets of plugs on my floor. I've got extension cords in just about every outlet.
How do you send a video to yourself
That’s a fucking zip tie not a “cable tie”
It's not a so great idea tidings cables in a spiral with alternated current running through them
A cable mess is best. Cable organization is useless as you will be undoing it constantly to replace or add cables
You know your in trouble when you don’t even have enough room for a box
Zip ties not cable ties.
Nobody talking about how one of his devices apparently charge with a usb cable
Wireless everything
Me sending it to myself cuz I’m in need be like
yo anyone else wanna see how cool this guys house is

There is literally nothing in this world they can fix my cable management

You just made life easier 😎
Every 60 seconds a minute passes.
Or just glue a lego character somewhere and wires/cables fit perfectly in the fand
very intelligent
I mean the part you said «  send this to someone in need » I think we all need help with cables
I know you are from the UK so you wouldn't know but those cable tidy boxes are really bad advice for many countries that don't have the same safety regulations. Extension cables in the US are usually using way worse than the recommended 14 guage and aren't fused to prevent excessive pull of power. This makes them a much higher fire risk. This is made worse in enclosed spaces like that box. Even bundled cables can be risky in some countries as poor regulations lead to cables themselves getting really hot and often insulation used around cables is flammable and produces toxic smoke when on fire. This is less of an issue in the UK where all plugs are fused including which prevents pulling more electricity than the cable is rated for. However... In the UK plugs that integrate a transformer are more common and those get really hot and shouldn't be put in a tidy box. Be safe and aware of the dangers of electrical fires. Ugly is always preferable to killing your whole family on accident.
Step one: have money
What if we don't have any and can't afford any😂🙂
Cool
I am going to tag me @Me
I actually like cables but I like the tips
Now do one for the earphones

You said send it to someone in need so this video is going to my local food bank.
Yeah but no money so tangle town it is 
I'm just wondering why no one has sent me this
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
E. You can cut them.
Song name?
i Should probably Forward this to myself!
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

"How to ACTUALLY Hide your cables."  so the exact same techniques everyone has been using forever lmao
The real nightmare is the fact that there's no Rick Roll in this short
Hmm maybe I can do that
Nice information ❤❤❤
tech source kids please watch
Bro!! 🤯👍✨
yeah and I just searched up how much everything one of those items cost and the lowest one which is that cable ball cost about $150 and I'm not accounting for tax either so most people don't want to spend their money on that and would rather deal with Messi chords and hundreds of dollars to get an item don't make it look better
On the cable tidy box theres a little thing on the top that has Rick Astleys face
Not even kidding i have that exact same cable holder. Did you get it off of amazon?
E. Most people don’t care about these tiny stuffs.

morron u are. Are u not to old for these easy child videos? damn think about
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                                 /.,/.,,                        /.,/.,/.              ./,,/.,/.

Awesome
Depending on your desk, large binder clips are handy to guide cables. I clip them over the 1" top of my desk, and run my speaker cords along the edge. Also, they can be used like this for managing cords that often need to be retracted. For example, I clip medium sized binder clips onto my hanging laptop power chord to to weigh it down and automatically retract it when I unplug (this cord always stays attached to my desk).
I’m back
Knowing my dumb@ss i would still make a mess 😕

Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise.

Pewidepie to Pokimane:
Evem better tip, rather then cable ties use the velcro ties instead, makes it easir to remove wires or add more
All my cables are going in a different direction though >:( Not to mention having to constantly remove things and take everything off the desk to clean.

But what happens if you’re too broke to buy any of these
https://youtu.be/d1cv2sRgNuA
all you want but no money
Where is the rick roll on this video?
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!
Still it's mess on my desk
Man you rickrolled us again
or just be normal and don’t care about it because it doesn’t boost your fps smh
Zip ties are from the devil!!  Never ever do this!
It was all an advertisement wasn't it

Hold up you call them cables? I call them wires or whatever my dumb brain comes up with in the moment 😂
I jus have a couple Velcro strips I use plus black electrical tape to keep my tv cords neat.
Pokimane taking notes 🖋📘👀
This is cable management, not cable hiding 😈
nice ad
The fyp has sent this to me, and I am most likely not gonna use it
I like the concept of cable management but for me I rather have the cables loose. It allows me to get in easily and unplug anything I need to or if I want to rearrange something. If I'm sitting at my desk then I'm not going to see it. But I use Cable Management in the monitor and make everything look neat and tidy on the desk. But sometimes I choose function over aesthetics.
OMG! This video is on #2 Trending
._. Or if you're broke. You braid the wires together, not actually forcing them but just lightly speghetti wrap them together. As long as you dont rip and crunch the internals you're good.
#3 on trending wow
Or could not be a moron/be lazy
You said send a person in need I don’t know how to send this myself but I need all.
heyyy, the fidget cable!
Been looking for this! 🙏
Beutiful shering vidio
Was just looking for cable tidy stuff online lol
hey what's your name and where are you from
Can't magnets ruin your phone/device??
Everyone looking at cable me looking at his thighs
Cut them
I was planning on using the first three even before watching this but I need to wait until Christmas
I need that all everytime we had a slumber party in my grandma my god all our cabels is everywhere i was stress which one is mine😪😪
BEST SOLUTION IS GET UNPLUGGED AND GO OUTSIDE AND LIVE LIFE
Is it possible to send that to a hotel family?
Some things in life we can't cure, but have to ignore.
Those are called zip ties my friend
No Rick roll this time? 😔
Heh, as if I’m that productive pfft
After the clip with the magnets, Arun said send this to someone in need. I'm buying those magnets for myself.
5  buy a NEW good Table
You don't need to hide cables if you don't have any.  Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
Me having multiply fidget cable them getting tangle and attached and never coming out
None of these "tips" are actually about hiding cables.
They don't call the *cable* ties for nothing
Ngl i need everything
Good, now my cables are well organized, but how do I hide them?
*Proceeds to send this video to myself*
When you try to turn on an old TV but it won't work         Then you check the outlet and it was unplugged at some point
Number 1 if you have cables going in the same direction use CABLE TIES it’s like wow it’s not like CABLE is in the name
Why he sit like that😭😭
sending this to myself 👍🏼
Zip ties for cable management? Nah b, use Velcro.
For c it is cheaper and cooler to just use lego mini figures
Wait... my physics isn't that good, but won't the last one create magnetic field when a current flows through the coil? And isn't that bad for electronics??
Not me trying to send this to myself
Don't use zip ties, they are a pain when you add it remove cords. Use a Velcro strap instead. I have loop side out strips staples under my desk. I'll also coil my cables with the hook side out and just press it anywhere under my desk
It’s a ZIP TIE not CABLE TIE
I myself am in need 😂😂😂, being an digital artist is not much fun when it comes to my devices chargers and cables.... They are a nightmare

Fidget cable?? I thought the original one is *SuperCalla* 🤔 like the original creator. was he exposed? did something happen? This is like copyright infringement but also not because it's being sold.
Me
What do you mean send this to someone who is in need 😂 we’re all in need 😂
Man called zip ties cable ties
No
Velcros are better than cable ties to tie cables. You'll end needing to cut the cable ties again and again in case you ever need to adjust or change cables.

Dude I can’t afford anything 😂
The fifth way is to cut them
Pokimane
These ideas are decent, but they're not great and they're basically just product placement, truth is you should just make the cables part of the decoration, go for a stupid disorganized vibe with your room decor
Oh come on an advertisement for magnetic cable... not even cable sleeves... thats lame
Those are called zip ties
I have multiple cables which keep up other cables that at their turn keep up other cables.
Bread ties work just as good as cable ties
Why does this guy wiggle so much
'someone in need' i.e. me
just tie them in a braid if they go on the same direction and branch of as needed
*Claim Your here within a hour ticket now!.*
Nice
all of this seems like such a waste of time and money  zipties are great if all of your cables are the exact same length, which they never are.  cable boxes take up more space than the cables themselves, so if you are going minimalist this aint it  cable holders are probably the only thing I can see being useful
Ties aren't really my thing. They still look kinda messy. But the rest seems quite nice
Cable ties r great till u need one of the plugs for something else
*pokimaine enters the chat*
Nice
No rickroll? Are you ok man?
I only have 2 charger I’m ok
At some point in time, we will not need cables. The future is coming.
"cable's are a nightmare" I think you meant "life is a nightmare"

Haha exposed cable go brrr
No need to send it,I’m the one in need
FYI the magnetic cables you showed are really shitty. I have some and all three broke in a couple days
the last option can mess your electronic devices, you created a spire stack witch create an inductance who mess with other electric devices (electromagnetics laws)

Well, never cover the plugs, its not a good idea

This is actually wrong my mom did alot of cable manedgement becase she like when things are neat she would usually wrap them up in a loop and tape them  It seems harmless at first but the heat of the electricity  from some devices would cause some cables to melt
Or...... buy wireless
I'm going to send this to myself
Dislike
Use an amazon
To organize cables  we need to buy more cables
What if my messy outlet thing is inside a cable tidy box making it a messy box
If you have tons of things plugged in on the floor (most of you do) Me looking down at the two power strips i use To power my 6 computer set up
I just use scissors. They help cable management but cable usage is down the drain.

****+++++++((((((*******!!!!!!!!!!VELCRO!!!!!!!!!********)))))))))+++++++++***** , not zip ties (at home). If is and IDF that wont be touched for years then zip ties can be used for sharper corners in tight turns when outting the cables at the back of the IDF.
Lolol nice video

Option B is just the equivalent of shoving stuff in a closet because you don't want to clean it up

I have never heard of a tidy box. Though looking at my desk setup, I don't think I need it. Also zip ties are an annoying cable holder. They got velcro ones that work better, or just get a sleeve.
who on earth calls those cable ties ive literally never heard anyone say that
Wait, so... You can use cable ties to tie cables together? Can you help me with another problem? I've been boiling coffee in a golf bag and using my coffee pot in place of a nine iron.

Or just hide it all behind the desk like I do XD
Hey. As someone who has professional installed cables. Do not use zip ties. Buy Velcro instead so you can add more cables to a trunk (if and when) you expand.

These cost money i have no money
me who cant buy it:
Cable sleeves in various thickness give the appearance of a single cable. Nylon type that curl around in white looking look better than the hard plastic that you spilt and insert.
That's not a cable tie, those are tweezers.
When rolling cables, twist one loop forward, then one backward, over and over. It rolls up looking the same, but it will unroll straight, with no twist at all.

Never use zip ties and if you do don't pull them to tight because they can break the wires inside the insolation. I use Velcro ties off Amazon or those cut to size Velcro tape.

Or... Just get a cable sleeve w/ zipper for the ones at the power strip.. cheaper and easier to move around if you have more cables. Never use zip ties. You could set them too tight and turn your cables.
PC players are thirsty for this inventions!😂🤣🤣 Really like the magnetic wire but I got a question wouldn't the magnet interrupt the Flow of Current?

Thats my daily problem
When I had my bedroom re done up I had my speakers and PC wired built into the wall….
My cables are unmanageable. I've spent hours trying to organize them. I have all of the following (except the passive speakers) plugged into both the wall and the TV/Receiver (one of them connected to both) some of them using several cables to connect:  Laserdisc player CED Player VHS VCR Betamax VCR Xbox Xbox 360 AV switch Wii Video 8/Hi-8/Digital 8 VCR Nintendo Super Nintendo 4K disc player PlayStation 2 Atari 2600 Roku TV Receiver 5 passive speakers Powered subwoofer  I am using 3 power strips because there are only 2 plugs near my TV.

I need these advice thanks 😀😀
don't use cable ties, use velcro instead. problems with cable ties is that u can't reuse them

Cable management should be taught from an early age.

Please don’t use zip ties they are wasteful and annoying in this application, better thing to use is cable organizing straps (basically Velcro straps) they are reusable and if you need to remove things you don’t require snips
What country are those plugs from????
i need the sountrack pls
Can you Please give me one iPhone 13 mini or any iPhone
Ayoo noice
Those are zip ties not cable ties wtf
Ah yes, use more cord to see less cord, then use a paid for box that hides your mess. Much Improved!
The fact that he didn't rickroll us in this viddo
Instead of cable ties it's much better to use cable velcro straps. That way you don't have to cut the zip ties if you suddenly wanted to move some of the cable to other places.
WARNING: the magnet cable can fry itself pretty fast at least in my experience with them so yeah
Not "send it to someone in need" , I REALLY NEED IT😭
I deff have this and i pretty much didn't care about it other than safety
im always moving mine so i cant organize lol
Cable Ties? Why not use velcro and save time cutting + tie up the ties when you need to take the cables.
i need this cuz im literally using rubber bands to tie them in one place  im that broke
Imma send this to my dad lol
I do the blanket where I just don’t need to see it
I just don't get why a white box with a spliter inside is more tidy than just the spliter. The wires are still there and it's not like the spliters themselves aren't a box already

Ok I need 2.3 km fidgit cabel
Keep in mind, tying data transferring wires can cause interference.
*Sends it to my dad*
“Send this to someone in need”  Me: How do I send this to myself??
Immediately after the first statement,  my thought was ", That's why I hang myself from them."   That's why I am still in therapy.
I would like this if I had the money to buy these things
I have a cable tidy box, they make everything look so good
Cable aren’t that bad lmao 😂
Love you bro
If I know I am not going to move them for a long time I braid them and then tuck them behind a leg of a table or whatever they are on and ziptie them
Me
Most ppl need it lol
K well when you buy me these products I'll start using them, cause unfortunately I'm broke as fuck
Idk where i can get money for those stuff
"Send this to someone in need" **Sends it to myself**
This video was just, u have a problem, buy This item
The most effective way to deal with cable is to cut them, it allows for wireless headphones, wireless pcs, you can make everything wireless just by cutting them (to explain, wires give out a strong wave, which allows the other end of the wire to react to the wave, allowing for usage.)
I love your videos
hide cables under your wall railing (if you have some) really nice!
Imma just go head and send this to myself
Anyone else thought he was putting the extension cord box into a tub of water?

Day 7 of asking for a Z Flip 3
0:09 Cablemance
Or just Ask me
No I won’t
I'd probably be the one needing this. Guess ill send it to myself
How can hide the cables at a pc?
Why do I keep seeing this everywhere? These aren't life hacks like, finding common things around your house to use for stringing cables together. This is just, "Buy something that hides/bundles them together!" Stop trying to use money as the answer to everything, and try being creative.
I'm kinda banging the BGM, anyone know what it is?
wait, the fidget cable makes no sense it has magnets all over the wire, won't that like affect the electric current going through the wire?
OK

I actually don’t have any of these promblems because I only have a couple cables and that’s my alarm clock couple chargers and my Alexa; and there all connected to a lamp that’s has a set of plugs (just enough lol) and I just stick the loose cables behind the nightstand that the lamp is on
It's called a zip tie not a cable tie
How much did you get to promote the items?
Don’t use zip ties. Spend the little extra (really not even much) get the Velcro ties
