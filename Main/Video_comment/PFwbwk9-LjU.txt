3 years down the line,  and it still hurts 0:56
Imagine if this Mark Goldbridge was told our position in the league now
I just got this recommended to me after ten hag got sacked 😭
This is warm up pawn
Where's the same energy now that we're 14th?
love reading the chat saying ten hag will save them
🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Revisiting for that guaranteed serotonin boost! Thanks for the selfless act, Mark!
😂 couldn't bring himself to say 7 nil
player rating got sabotage.. hahaha
Who's here after United's 7-0 loss?
I’ll only came here now to see how far we’ve come from this game
wow, tough times
how do you make the score in the background
One of the best nights
It could have Been 5:1 hahga
well i sure hope someone picks up that phone coz scholes f*ckin called it
❤
Funny to see this after ETH going 0 - 4 to Brentford and 3 - 6 against City
The Ed Woodward era was an absolutely monumental disaster in the history of this great club - and he was appointed by...you guessed it...the greedy thieving Glazers.
Well well well 9-0 on agg
Ole, the struggle ball merchant
I am here after the 4/1 defeat  Vs Man City. Good to see Man United are still as crappy as always 😉
Man for man, united are definitely not better than Liverpool😂
The player ratings 😂😂😂 pure comedy…. 6.8 ole 😂😂😂
Ole's tactics white board just says "good luck today lads!"  with a smiley face.
If Moyes didn't have the job when Fergie left, ye would be looking for him. The way he got Lingard playing and West Ham vastly improved.
Million miles alway from decent football
How about you and experts put the blame where it belongs, the PLAYERS. !!!!!!

Ronaldo is gonna be made player manager next 🤣
Maybe take 2 3 years more for united to get back the level of liverpool again..
Banter club at best..not level anymore haha
9:06 wtf are you on Mark? So you’d have two footed Van Dijk and taken Red, but what about the guy?  So it’s now okay if we kick Ronny on his head and get him permanently outta football and someone takes the Red. Got it. That’d be a medicine for him and ya. What a silly prat! You and your Ronny who cracked under pressure and has more shots of Curtis than on the post. Disgraceful bruv.
Your first eleven is not better than Liverpool's, man for man or not.
SHIB INU 🚀
I would love to see whoever the manager is how they work out the midfield with that current squad... and how they make a leader of the captain who so obviously isnt one and shouldnt have been put in that position
Ole in
Penaldo out
Glue Ole's hand's to the wheel.
He has morals but continues to play Mcguire and Fred whilst playing bad game after, let's not talk about Maguire and Lindeolf!!
harry maguire lolololololololol
im sure goldbridge is a rearender
CMon the POOL,
You would have two footed Virgil would you big man? Possibly would have been your last act ever. As cretinous as Pogba.
Can't believe you all think the manager has much say ,he won't even select the team., you all clearly haven't worked in football to witness how it is one big circle jerk , freemasons club. The top 5 managers in the world can negotiate a little to their input. The others are just pawns
Give him more time Mark. He is close to getting it right. He's only a few toes away from the team being amazing. Things will improve...at the next derby it will only be 3-0, which will be progress. Ole is a legend, whether he's teaching PE or driving a lorry or a bus, no one should get more time than him.🙏
Don't get drawn into the North London mediocrity ole out
Wasn’t Woodward supposed to be leaving after the Super League fell apart? 😂 Think he discreetly decided to stick around after all
Ronaldo needs to retire. At this point, at his age, he’s just a drag at every club he goes too because he doesn’t have the pace and mobility he needs at 36
United are only missing the white sleeves on the home kit- They’re Arsenal now
I said before the game that we would batter the crap out of man United.    I said we needed to show no mercy against man United . To be ruthless and the boys did me proud.  It made it even funnier  the fact that sir Alex Ferguson was watching 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  I predicted someone will get Sent off because of how many yellow cards were given. It was a matter of time .  I have no sympathy for man United none.  Salah scoring a hat trick since kuyt did it at anfield in 2011.  I wanted us to score  7,8,9 but the boys were saving energy for the next game .game management which I like to see us not turning the game into a basketball match .   I will never forget this for a very long time.  The Atalanta game was brushing man United's weakness under the carpet
Liverpool's first team is better than United's
My brother was not happy when Man Utd lose to Liverpool he even said that ole is needs to leave because he is crap at being a manager
Surely you don't really think Utd's first XI is better than Liverpool's?
At last.We are all (most) on the same hymn sheet. Mark finally, FINALLY, opens his nostrils to the smell of the coffee he has been ignoring, and capitulates, admits, utters, OLE OUT! Now, for the love of God, please can it actually happen?!
klopp just played chess seen the weakness exploited .!! live n learn
Get Steve Bruce, aii the none manc fans around the country will pay his wages ,half a mill a week , be worth every penny
Ole out your making me loss love for my club
Ole please out
Man united resign Cristiano ronaldo.............man united get relegated to the championship
Goldbridge you’re hilarious 😂
Newcastle in the next few years are another team that will be playing for the top 4.
Chelsea did it with frank lampard and lampard did way more and was a bigger legend but Chelsea put the club first
Ex players are interfering sooo much they have lost all credibility !! I’m sure the management will make changes - it’s a matter of when during this season and who replaces him
Man City is more of a rival
Anyone else come here just for marks reaction lol
Hahahahhhaha up the fucking reds!!!
Plz 🥺🥺
“We’ve dug so low we’re touching Kylie and Jason’s toes”😭😂 even when we’re getting battered mark always somehow makes me giggle.
Never ever seen people flood out instead of in !!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬
I DO NOT WANT ZIDANE NO WAAAAAAY NO WAY AT ALL HE WOULD RUIN US EVEN MORE ...AS FOR (CARRICK AND OLE )NOOOO MORE !!!!!!!!
Man... You don't even get to complain  Maguire made your combined XI ahead of any Liverpool defender.. shush
Not so Fantastik
I can’t understand how the football savvy directors like Sir Alex can’t identify the problems and take action. Did he really think Maquire was a wise signing? The media pressured Utd into shelling out £79M for a broken fridge when they could’ve got De Ligt got £40M and Woodward swallowed it hook, line and sinker!
Salford United. Your not even located in Manchester 😂
I see Ronaldo as the bigger problem than Ole. Mu fans seem to have some problem of analysis.
when has there be a real TEAM Performance? Its mainly a individual effort that gives us a win. Thats not the managers credit. But there has been real bad Team Performances and thats Oles fault. We all knew Ole is out of his debt but we all wished it isnt like that. Unfortunately where we are now is exactly what we knew would happen. We need a Top Manager who makes the best out of individuals. Thats a hard job and Ole is not up for the task.
Arteta better than Ole, fact😎
Brandon Rogers were doing way better than Ole when liverpool sack him..why? Because liverpool is a big club n wanted a big manager
A bit hypocritical isn’t it? You told Arsenal fans to stay patient with Arteta and give him time but then you say Ole out?
Peak entertainment 😭🤣🤣🤣 🎶 Na Na Na Ole's at the wheel, Ole is at the wheel🎶
Please Ole out , Zidane or Conte in
Ole out🙏🙏🙏🙏
Only tuned in to watch this clowns reaction 🤣
Ole said he thinks they were still in the game at 0-3. He is hallucinating when he is said that this team had a chance to come back in the second half. Ole has lost his marbles.... Locker room is gone.
I hate it when we start to eat our young. Ole knows the standards and will come to his conclusion. The team would of been given a plan….. they failed to deliver….. some poor signings have got us here
We battered you lot how can you say we didn’t play that well we destroyed you lot and rightly so
Ole out, Scholes in.
We should go for Ralph Hassenhuttl !!!
I wouldn't sack him for the 5-0 loss (even though it should have been much more, had Liverpool not taken their foot off the gas after 60th minute) alone. But given that the whole season has been bad, and most of the points earned were "lucky" (most of them were from the morale boost of signing Ronaldo, and ones like against atalanta and villareal were last ditch efforts)
Ole 6.8😳 Shocking
The Board need aggresive SHAKEUP..The Management Team (Football) total re-vamp, Big Headed/Under Performance Players to be bench and see out after contract...re tain 100%Man United Players and bring ON Academy Players (6-9)youth players...we will see improvement...God Bless..
I do like Shaw , but my god he has been abysmal this season , how many goals have come from his side this season !
He can’t sack himself but he can walk away
24:30 not a chance lol
SIUU7UUUUUU
oh dear, what a match to watch. Man Utd are really struggling ......
man finally lost his virginity and said ole out instead of sitting on the fence every video. all it took was an ass whopping by liverpool which was so obviously coming, looking at how the team's been playing this season since the start.
Sam Alladyce is available
No matter what anyone says, Manchester United will never fire this man anytime soon. Y’all need to see that already
Ole Out.
OLE INNNNNN
Ronaldo needs to be captain
Leave and save his legacy? Yesterday is his legacy mate.
I dont know what game Mark was watching. Bruno was the shining light in this team.
What's the obsession with Zidane?
Ole will leave you after losing to Tottenham and ManCity, and probably Atalanta as well.
This match really show us that Ole simply don’t have any tactic. Talented boys are there for an EXPERIENCE MANAGER, and Ole absolutely out of the list.  Let’s remember him as a super-sub player for united in his time. What united need now is a manager with a vision to bring the best of the team.   All united fans deserves an attacking and entertaining display on the pitch that might bring the trophies after a long long long time without any😔😔😔
The crazy thing is Arsenal have the same points and spurs have more
Player for player, Liverpool is still miles ahead of United. Bar maybe Sancho, Greenwood and CR7, Liverpool’s squad is much better than Utds. Come on Mark be realistic.
Banta club. Absolute wet wipes. HAHAHA
Cardiff fan's already had warned Utd fans Ole was bad but nobody listened
We DON'T all love you Ole AND enough is enough now !
6s all around best performance this season united were class
Wow the pressure must be getting to Ole, he came to United looking like Sméagol and three years later he's Gollum...........
Keep him in. Beep beep.  Banter FC
I made the call that Liverpool will devour us the way we are playing.  That was before the international break. We just aren't making progress
Sad reality is that Ole won't be fired. He does not have the experience and judgment to manage a team of this stature in the world's best league. Neither can Maguire be captain
OLE IN MAN WE HAVE TO GIVE HIM TIME! Only lost 1-0 in the second half, OLE IN
Ole out when you loose oles the best when you win bunch of losers
Vvd would knock Ronaldo clean out
lol before the game you claim man for man you were the better team ahahaha. deserve everything you get
Didn’t you lot loose to S*urs this time last year 6-1 ? He stayed on then and got second . The board will look at that and think we may as well keep him .
And don't forget, just days before Mark put SIX United players in his combined XI. Absolute farce the opinions fans have of these players.
Wtf Goldbridge...youd have clattered Virgil? I'd like to see you try 🤣🤣🤣...Ronaldo shudda been off
Ole in😂😂😂🇧🇻🇧🇻🇧🇻
Ten hag ❤️
Ole should get a 1/10 player rating surely
Amen to this. Ole Out, finally! God bless.
Player for player you think you have a better team? mancs are so deluded.
You finally said ole out
The Liverpool away end trolled us all game. Ole at the Wheel and Paul Scholes sucks his daughters toes chants :(
i dont know buying a dm would fix the problems
When you said on paper, player for player Man U has the better team I nearly fell off my chair laughing. Looking at life through tinted glasses much?
Mate we are simply a superior team. You think you can just buy the league whereas our coach believes in a philosophy and improving the players he has.
Can not understand how the supporters, can see the problems but the people that make the teams play like that can not.
Pathetic finished club not even to our strongest team.
Ole out. If his not out after this game, the board shld get the SACK!!
I do not understand why people in comments even mention Neville. He isn't very bright. Or If he isn't that dumb he can't think clearly because he is biased because of friendship with Ole or other players. Why you care what Neville thinks? Neville talks about football like some schoolteacher commenting on Einstein's work.
Packets of waterproof teabags? 🤣🤣🤣
Wonder what Moyes, Van gaal, Mourinho are thinking about how their work was demeaned...and a MU Legend hailed as a superior manager....🤔
United have been poor since the season Ferguson won the title in his final season, conceding goals left right and center. We need a manage to come in BEFORE the transfer window and make s statement of intent, come out and say certain players are not good enough and publicly put them on the transfer list! The players at this team have gotten away with so much under Moyes, Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole, there's no passion in the team, it's painful to watch them
Fernandes should be captain
Ole at the wheel. He's doing a brilliant job. Another 5 years.
Harry Maguire needs to be dropped for the foreseeable future.
If we bring in Zidane or Conte, ‘Ole out’ is pointless 😕
Call Conte
I just try to look at the positive side. This defeat really exposes ole ..hard. I hope the board took this slap in the face and hire conte or zidane ASAP
I have come round to the view that Ole has to go. But so do half of that team. Somehow we have landed ourselves with a bunch of players on long contracts at wages no other club would contemplate paying. They don't care! When Ronaldo was surrounded by Liverpool players the only one to come to his aid was Bruno. Can you imagine that happening in the '90s? You here stories about Bryan Robson coming off the pitch and having to lie down in the dressing room because he was so knackered. Did any of that team feel even a little tired after that shambles? They certainly didn't run much during the 90 minutes. So, yes, Ole has to go, do it now so that the new man has time to clear out the dead wood - half the current first team squad! - in January.
Why do you think Ole is in charge of player selection  (which players are bought) That could be why he is not fired as the person in charge refused to get player position he asked for
Ole the Wally is very, very appropriate.fo4 for the last year I a previous manager of a little old town in Essex managing in border league then ridgeons premier have being saying for over a year that yes carrick was a very good player but he is hopeless as a coach and the same with phelan . The whole set up is complete in disciplined, it’s more like a cosy little cup of tea have biscuit hands and cuddles meeting throughout the club. It’s all far, far to friendly.
Zidane!!! Why!! Conte is out there..
Enough is enough he's not a manger just sends players out and hopes for the best
When does he say tits on a nun fc
It's  time to ole's out..
If he stays I fear the love we have for him will turn into hate
we CANT DEFEND WE CANT WHYYYYYYYYYYYY mid field is the same failed
Make CAVANI, VARANE OR CRISTIANO Captain.... Maguire is not a leader.
change of manager and captain both
you need a leader to lead any team and that is the manager first than the captain
your our voice plz keep raising your voice we are behind you
It's not just about yesterday the performance's haven't been good for weeks coaching staff and OLE need to go
OLE OUT
all the records of this manager has are of OUT
ENOUGH OLE OUT
It doesn’t get any lower then this point!!
Ronaldo wouldn't two foot VVD cos he's a bloody wimp, that's why he picked on the kid Jones instead haha
Boys, opinions on Diego Simione
New manager and new captain. Ronaldo is clearly the most natural captain over Maguire.
👉Pogba is the man of the match. Seriously! Pogba saved ManU from huge 10/0 defeat. What he did to Kaita terrorized all Liverpool players & their coach to avoid frustrating ManU players more & come things down.  I think Pogba should be the best player of this game. 🙄
The one common denominator throughout the last 4 managers, is David  de Gea….Hello…!!
ole in
Paul Scholes should coach ManU at least temporarily. 🙄 He has been seeing the problem & understanding it.
Liverpool passing it around for 30 minutes was embarrassing tbh this is one of the biggest games of the season and you looked shocking
The only option left is to five your manager, sorry *fire your manager....
Sign Conte or Zidane ASAP........
What’s the player being a millionaire got to do with them tweeting to the fans saying sorry and that they feel the loss aswel?  There are man United supporters in that squad!   You don’t dictate if someone can talk mark you sausage
Conte IN
Does Ole has a coaching philosophy or just get in there an play your best,this is appalling
Ole out. It's that simple.
ManU & PSG have the same problem; great players in scrambled eggs coaching style. 🤢🤮
Shouting “OLE HAS GOT TO GO” but I’m not screaming and shouting about it 😅
I don't day this often but Fred deserved to be United's man of the match. He worked his socks off in a midfield that was absolutely overran.  It was 2 v 3 all game long. No help from the front and no help from the back line and he still made a few really good tackles. I actually feel sorry for him.
Share this vedeo
“I’ll never be an Ole in, Ole out. it’s Toxic” I’m sorry but who else shall we bring in? We need to wait until the right person comes in not just get a hitman for 2/3 years. We need long term solutions. Sometimes you need to get through adversity and be patient. We are still a few players away from silverware. We can’t play a style of play because of the different personnel. Can’t play high press, can’t play possession. Can’t even play a 4-3-3 because pogba wouldn’t work hard enough in a double pivot this is why managers need time. I mean sure sack Ole… but remember the next manager that comes in don’t hope for overnight success as it would take even longer to solve
Buy some defenders first
What makes you think Zidane would consider managing this band of misfits?
And defensive is totally Zero without varane...
Conte did it in italy, can to England and did it, went back to Italy to a different team and did again... Organise defense in a special way, yeah he is better than fluke Zidane for me...
Ole has done a lot but if he still loves us he needs to go while he’s still has our respect Our options are Zidane, Conte, Bruce
Well said...McTom&Fred should be replace by VanDebeek&sancho
Finally!
For Me The Funs should stop going to stadium to watch our matches if they don’t wanna sack Ole, or we have to protest for our board to sack him.. it’s really an embarrassment for us to be thrashed 5 by Liverpool
Nepotism exposed.
You just worried about MacFred but problem is much more than that,one of the huge problem is the team don't know how to play without the ball because as we know this is very important in any team  and this is %100 depending to the defensive system and how to coach  the team to defend  ,secondly is shortage of leadership in the team,I mean we don't have anybody to take the responsibility in difficult  circumstances and lead the team out of it.
We would have lost 10-0 if it wasn't Liverpool pulled the plug to save Ole's job!!  Because they want him to stay in this job as MU manager for as long as it takes.  It was so obvious...
👍👍👍👍👍
Last season Bruno saved you  This season it was clear that you didn’t need Ronaldo at all but still went for him because of nostalgia and business   Since the Leeds match it was clear that United is a sinking ship but still got saved by Ronaldo or De Gea in some of the games   The euphoria of last minute goals blindfolded most of you but It was waiting to happen   The moment you would face a decent team you guys would be disintegrated.   With confidence this low  Man City will shrink you to the core  Mark my words
Conte
When fans expect managers to walk I always think it’s so stupid.   Mark would you walk a job you could get fired and still make £8m from? Just so United could maybe win the title this season?  Yeah didn’t think so.
There is time please Ole Out... If not then there is huge down to red devils...Need to change some formation Asap
😂😂😂😂😂 ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
They just give ole new contract, what waste to pay him off
Mark you have to play Chelsea soon aswell 😂😂
Legends never work out as managers of their own club
Paul Scholes rated MU defence better than Chelsea's.  Really 🥺🥺😂😂
Steve Bruce is obvioulsy a great manager, according to ex United players and he’s now available. Treated unfairly by Toon fans they said. Go on and appoint him and see for yourself how great he is.
When Mark speaks, you listen because it is always right
Not sure if I've ever seen utd getting played with that badly at Old Trafford. Was Liverpool outstanding or we Utd just that bad.
Perhaps OGS is better off managing Molde back in Norway.  The United job is too massive for him.
Gary Neville would be a good replacement….
I don't get it isn't it a manager's to job to do the tactics?
I said after the Everton game, Ole has took us as far as he can. He and all the coach's need to go This Week
I don’t see why we can’t play Bruno as box to box? I’m sure he played that for sporting.. just like de bruyne does for city. Play Sancho on the right and make rashford track back.
Ole is ruining the club going forward he should leave today . He will always be a hero to us but Ole can’t manage this team
Ole has to go with the coaching staff. I am frustrated with the tactics that are been played. Ole is a club legend but not a coach/manager. He should do the right thing and part ways with coaching the club.
Somebody should call to Zidane.......................
hes too arrogant to leave
Glazzers going to ipl franchise😂😂😂
Van Dijk cost 75m. Harry McFridge cost 80m Leicester City conned us big time.
At this point, nothing pains me anymore when it comes to Manchester United FC
Get Zidane in and former legend or someone to be assistant...like evra
Give Ole a pay rise and a longer contract.
Agree with everything you said Mark.. had enough of this. We are gonna get battered by City and Varane and Ronaldo will have to play Europa again if Ole is given till the end of the season
Goldbridge says Zidane but what he may not be aware of is Zidane quit Real Madrid twice because he felt undermined by the board. He won't take BS from Woodward and the Glazers.
How many Man Utd players would get in this Liverpool’s XI? answer is ZERO
Sign Ted Lasso and coach beard now!!!!!
Ole is not going anywhere. The Glazer's won't sack him. We are stuck with Ole this season. Let's get ready to watch these results week in week out. Cheers lads, we are getting relegated.
If he respects the club he should just resign, he's not good enough .... He's fucking clueless...
2:43 - "He couldn't lead a pack of Ants to a Picnic" 😄
Wan Bissaka worse signing than Fred. Can't defend, can't attack, can't dribble and can't pass.  Good at slide tackles that give the ball away for a throw in. Livramento or Lamptey clear.  Maguire shocking. Tried to  convince myself he was good but so slow and not a top tier CB  Dan James sold Donny never used Telles never used  Cavani obsolete because of Ronaldo Bruno good but was better  Sancho never used  Not good recruitment that's a myth!  Not  good manager!   OLE OUT
Why can’t he just resign gracefully? It’s ok to hold up your hand and say ok I can’t take this team further. No shame in that.  Fans will have more respect for him if he steps down gracefully.  Enough is enough.
Ole a nice bloke but the job too big for him.
it just pisses me off knowing the ole is going to lead man u out against atalanta. we are better off just having one of the cooks at old trafford taking the team than ole.
utd next two games tottenham away, city at home,lol
Ole need to understand the team is not the problem.  The only thing that matters. It's the driver, not the car
OLE OUT. Please gag "Gary Glazer"
OLE IN
A Loss Is A Loss, Doesn't Matter If It's Against Liverpool or Burnley. This Is Painful, This Is Very Painful.😔😔😔😔
"I'd have two-footed him." Gross. Just because Ronaldo was being called out for being a petulant child, you'd intentionally try/support a player intentionally trying to injure another? Thought you were better than that Mark. To justify it as simply "going that way" is a Roy Keane level of what-aboutery-led "hard man" bollocks.
NO ONE IS BIGGER THAN THE CLUB NO ONE
The fact you said player for player United are better than Liverpool is deluded. Ronaldo, Bruno, that’s it.
the reserves can play better than this.
atalanta rating vote : 11k viewer.  Liverpool rating vote : 40k viewer.  Looks like some1 troll it .
Fred for player manager
They said man utd are title contenders with Ronaldo at utd 😂😂😂
We just going to ignore Mark saying uniteds team is better than Liverpools 😂
He couldn't lead a pack of ants to a picnic
At least arteta is not at the wheel atm 😂😂😂 give ole more time and a new contract  hes  the future  for man utd
It's called The Theater of Dreams because you have to be asleep to believe it.
We need a new chapter - Ten Haag is ideal right now for a fresh start. We need to approach him now and offer him a deal he can’t refuse. We need someone who’s experienced, can deal with big personalities and actually understands the game tactically. I know it’s a risk, but what could be worse than our current state.
Man u losing is ole's fault,but ill be damned if its his fault for the 5-0,like at what point r we gon hold these players accountable?
Agree about the all the coaching staff being replaced, but who with ?
"Player for player I'd argue our team is as good, if not better than Liverpool's". If you did try to argue that, I'd say that you should either expect the men in white coats to be knocking on your door, that you need to make an appointment to see an optician, or that "drugs are bad mkay".
Fred and ole have to go ASAP, embarrassing to watch 🙈🙈, ole do the decent thing and walk cause our club is been destroyed week by week 🙆‍♂️
Yes bro,ole tactics totally worse.he must be out
he has to go blud he has to go
Who bloody hell thinks ole can turn dis around
The sad thing is that this result was a long time coming. Ole has been bailed out by individuals for far too long and he has finally been exposed.
Watching Ole and our coaches at this level is painful, both embarrasing for them and the club to be exposed. Just relieve him off his duties, why let him out to dry? This can’t go on.
Bring in Erik ten Hag
Gary Neville’s refusal to criticise Ole after the game was extraordinary and embarrassing in equal measure. Makes a mockery of the idea that he’s a ‘great’ pundit.
I was ole out from Europa final, I don't know why its taken us so long to see ole is a pe teacher
Ole in
Harry is the worst captain
It was just 12 months ago Spurs beat you 6-1
Good job again Ole 😂
OH Man Our Defense 😣😣😣😣
More fun to come .....cmon City 💪😂
Managers and some players don't even care as long as they r getting paid.
Pogba is definitely leaving
Pirlo?
"Ole out" - Sun Tzu
I have no problem in sacking of Ole. But the sad thing is another cycle under this useless board
Varane, Ronaldo, Sancho in the summer and Utd still can't win. The squad is the best in the prem but they can't play as a team. Galactico mentality
"I would have two footed Van Dijk". Like hell you would have done that. You  would have 💩 your pants and scarpered as soon as he came anywhere near you.
Time is up he has to go. Fresh start with a new manager while the season is still salvageable
Magiure and lindelof is worst then macfred! Baily cant do any worst
If ole admits he does not do tactics that would be true it shows out in games we got no tactics🤷‍♂️
You will see. Ole will stay
Ole In
Gasperini?
Couldn't agree more with you Mark!!! Spot on...
He’s taken United as far as they can go under his reign. I think it’s time for a winner, someone to take it to that level expected back 10 years + ago.
The Liverpool players were actually Burnley players in disguise
no more time for ole!!!get out frm our club now n maguire is not capt material!!!!!out out out
Going through a rough patch and leaking goals - why not just tighten it up and play on the counter   Instead his 'tactics' were mental
The problem is you guys think you have a good team, YOU DO NOT
Finally!!! Ole and the Coaches have to go and i feel crappy saying this but it seems he is not the man! A good man and club legend but United are bigger than any manager and some of these players need to stand up and be counted too feel so sad...👹
There is no way he resigns.  He's not an idiot and neither is his agent.  It will cost millions to sack Ole and additional millions to hire someone new.  With that in mind, it makes financial sense to keep status quo.  The worst that will happen is missing out on Europe next year if you finish 8th or below.  Sorry, but that's reality at this moment.  If you want real change, you need to review your advice to Arsenal fans.
The current Cardiff manager has a higher winning percentage than Solskjear had at Cardiff.  Manchester United can pick up the Cardiff manager he will better Solskjear.
And seriously the  backroom staff of McKenna and Carrick have been absolutely useless two children on the bench with no passion
If ole don't go this season the only time I'll b travelling over 500 miles to old Trafford is to protest im disgusted he's had time the progress has been made now its time to compete ole ain't the man for the job he's done a good job building our team he just hasn't got the talent to take us to the top bring in TEN HAAG
I feel bad for players of genuine quality like pogba bruno shaw sancho and vdb being destroyed by mcfred and ole.
We can’t say a “project” takes more than three years, when Chelsea did it in one window. It’s that he can’t manage this team. The standards are that low, for the team that we have. Piss poor. And it’s weird thinking no conversations will go ahead after being absolutely outplayed in the first 45 minutes.
Waterproof tea bags 😂😂😂😂
We were here last season too. Give him another chance.  Nah nah nah im jk we really need zizou
This result has been coming and I for one have had enough of how our club is run...we need change and now
Goldbridge I agree 100% Ole biggest downfall was always playing his favorites. Greenwood, Rashford, Bruno, Macguire, Lindeloff, Shaw and Fred Mctommy. He doesn't play Mata, Matic, Eric bail Telles, Van Der Beek, Jesse and Sancho. Because he doesn't trust the whole squad. We Love him but he must resign,  I think Sir Alex is backing up him 100%.
Conte in ASAP
We need proper coaching. Utterly disgraceful display.  We need a proper coach.  This group has good players, but no formations. No tactics. One of the worst Sunday nights of my life.😭😭😭
I say let's give Ole until the end of the season. Progress has been made since he came, United was in like mid table, Ole took them to 2nd place last year, above Liverpool and Chelsea.
Bruno Fernandes is the most overrated player. He contributes nothing
Please give Ole a contract extension.
No proper formation, no structure, players dont know what to do. Ole has to go.
Fergie used to get the best out of average players.  Ole can’t even get the best out of top class players.
The players are getting comfortable because they’re no standards anymore. They can just do their PR stunts and enjoy their millions. Tuchel and Pep would have demanded more Ole looked more sad than angry . Ffs we’re getting in the arsenal comfort zone of mediocrity
The same way OGS destroy Cardiff City.
Jose Mourinho >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Ole shite
How can you start the same team that was 2-0 down to a semi b team of Atalanta at half time just 4 days later? Ole never helps himself.
MAN CITY IN A CRISIS 😂
Ole in!
jim white slow sports news
Can someone pls call A.Conte NOW.
Ole's at the wheel but he got a steering lock.
What made Man Utd think Solksjaer was capable in the first place? He was absolutely shocking at Cardiff City.
You've all got it wrong, you simply cannot blame Ole, in the dressing room he gave a passionate speech, High Fived every player and the team took that literally as a tactical instruction, hence 0-5.
ole out zidane in
diego simeone
Ole in 😂😂
We need Roy Kean now, we need his personality in this club.
I think we need a new fancam.. united stand has been run over by 'things'.. they sabotage everything after that win 😂😂
Van de beek probably on the bench laughing at that stupid coach. All that Ole is going through is the way he makes Van de Beek suffer
Even Sir Alex Ferguson walked out before the game ended🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️let that sink in too..
He couldn't lead a pack of ants to a picnic 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last week Liverpool beat Watford 5-0, then they go on and beat us 5-0. Just……
Can someone call Erik Ten Hag right now...
All in the caribean they laughing that game
Mourinho laughed at Gerard for the slip and now Liverpool laughed at ManU.
I don't like Ole's tactics. ...
Love the man. Hate the manager. He needs to move aside if he loves the club, at the moment Ole is delusional.
I did say if Ole don't fix his defence, Liverpool will put 5-0 past against us.Ole out and soon no time to waste on carbage manager.
Ole is  a good man but not a good coach for a club like man u, please Ole leave quietly 😣
if Ole is still in the job by the spurs game, I can bet he still will go with mcfred, pogba is suspended for however many games and I can't see him giving a chance for donny so we will still see mcfred again and again if Ole is still in the job
United fans laughed at Arsenals start to the season. Even on points now, ouch
Wondering what Paul Schole thinks of Man U defence since he's an expert.
Ole ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuttttttt!!!!
If solskjaer had actually taken to himself and gotten more experience in the coaching space, going to other clubs in Spain, France or Italy, mid-table teams and molding his style of football, he would’ve been better for it and this wouldn’t have happened.
Tits on a nun🤣
"I'm not screaming Ole out"  "Ole out"  I love Mark.
Even bottom of the league Norwich have a style of play
Man U got caught out easily in the defence and midfield against Liverpool. They didn’t even try
Penaldo has made United worse. Penaldo is a fraud, he’s not even top 5 greatest of all time. Top 10 if he’s lucky
"Tits on a nun FC" "Useless" 😂😂
Ole and his coaching staff have to go, they’re inept with modern game. The board has to be ruthless with Ole, let him go now to salvage this season. Every top manager out there is scratching their heads off now wondering why is Ole coaching that team and they’re not.
"He couldn't lead a pack of ants to a picnic!"😂 Thanks for putting a smile on my face, I needed that.
OLE OUT
He need to go
The main issue Man Utd. has is the owner and the manager. If the owner is still too hard to get rid of, then start with that Micky Mouse manager. Way too incompetent and out of class to go for the top. Klopp was very kind to not telling his team to go for more in the second half. In the next few weeks, Pepp, on the other hand, he won't.
Sam allardyce is available
I feel bad for sir alex Ferguson like he was literally ashame in the stands watching all those other liverpool board members laughing.....shame on today.
United “TOP 4” fack outta here Assna better
It's so HUMILIATING losing 5-0 to out biggest rivals is embarrassing. If OLE stays I'm not going to watch united again. I'm sorry if we're going to keep lose why should I endure being humiliated. The only reason we won agaisnt Atalanta was because of Ronaldo would scar his legacy if he ever went Europa League
To be honest tactically ole is worst than prilo and lampard😭😭😭
What else needs to happened for Ole to be out.  And McGuire needs to lose his arm band.  Both are not leaders of men.
Its done.i am done with ole n his staff. We need a world class manager
Manchester United are officially Banter FC.
I just noticed Goldbeidge looks exactly like young Oli
"this liverpool team look beatable" 😂😭
For the first time! Mark has come out decisively without sitting on the bench
The coaching/management team are learning on the job, at the biggest club in the world, what is going on?
When liverpool lost 5 home games in a row and lost 7- 1 to villa no one said anything
Ole stated "were this close,not giving up now" This close to what??..Winning the lottery? He has no way any intentions of leaving.  So he should be asked to leave. Come tomorrow or Tuesday morning, United should be shopping for a world class manager.
Ole is impressed with the team ! “ They worked their sock off “  For that he must resign …. sadly
I cannot believe that team sheet.
Week after week McFred.
Poor Ronny boy. Ronaldo posted on Instagram and he showed passion today. I’m sorry but Ole you must go for the sake of the club
I’ve finally realised that these players are frauds and all need to go, except from Bruno and Greenwood aswell as the new signings this season. They are all crap, over rated and screwed Jose the same way they are now screwing ole.
Glaciers cheaper out. We needed/ NEED a cdm
Ole out
That's a relegation performance. We took our foot off the gas with 20minutes left.
Zidane in....Ronaldo as captain...problem solved mate.
Nana Nana Nana Nana Na Na Na. Ole's at the wheel, at the wheel, Ole's at the wheel!  Nana Nana Nana Nana Na Na Na. Ole's crashed the bus, crashed the bus, Ole's crashed the bus!  Nana Nana Nana Nana Na Na Na. Glazers don't sack him, don't sack him, Glazers don't sack him!
Lads I'm fully Ole out but how do you expect him to resign from this job."He should have some pride" but he has a wife and kids to feed and I have a bet his job pays fucking well
Gary Neville: give Ole more time 😡😡😡
Mourinho could never
Ole will keep his job.  Draw against Spurs and probably rough up City to get a result.  Guaranteed
So enjoyable to see.
The fans are starting to wake up to what ole is a glazer stooge no clue no tactics no plan no direction a reckoning is in the air
Ole will resign IF he sees himself as part of the problem. But he doesn't.
“ He couldn’t lead a pack of ants to a picnic”. Now, that’s funny.
Gary Neville.. He WAS a good player, but as a pundit he's a bumb🤦‍♂️. He saying give Ole more time. Is he crazy or what🥵
How bad was luke shaw tho worst game i think ive ever seen him play
ive been saying Ole out since the first  season he arrived, What he got 2nd last season, its was one of the worst seasons, successively knocked out of Ucl in group stages and never better than liv,
Finished club 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I PREDICTED A SALAH HATTRICK
OLE OUT, sorry
Give him more time to destroy us and his own legacy
Relegation side Arsenal are now magically leveled on points with title challenging side Man U. Lol
Liverpool are much better player to player Mark - Better, gk,rb,lb,cbs,cdm, cm,rw,lw
fak ole
Zidane be interesting but Diego Simeone is what United need.   From a RED …..strangely feeling a little sorry for you lot. Think cos I know how it feels …..right back to Souness as Manager of LFC.  United back to square ONE post Fergie. worse NOW than under Moyes. and look at West Ham under Moyes. Quite possible West Ham finish above United under Olly.
FINALLY
Macquire out , lindelof out, Bailey in
Chelsea knew lampard was not good enough for the job and replaced him. He left the club still a legend. The longer Ole stays in this job, the worse his legacy gets. He’s dragging his reputation through the mud
Ole in forever! (When you speak disparagingly about Arsenal I'll go back to today in my mind).
Just was how Arsenal started. From league cup hoping to top 4 hoping
Steve Bruce is available , lovely bloke ,this is from your own ,,!!!
Club legend carried us out of a state we were in but it’s over now save your legacy Ole
Cavani , sancho , Matic , van de beek should play Ole is too trusted in Fred and Scott , but they are really not up to this level
"I'm not ole out but...."
This is gonna leave a mark on the red devils history
I've no sympathy for ole,he ruined VDB career. Ole out.
We’re not rivals with Liverpool, our revivals a4 arsenal and Leicester! Liverpool have won trophies last 4 years and our neighbours city and Liverpool are so far ahead that it’s disrespectful that we can say that this is a rival match! We’re a ducking shambles and Ole out! Ole out and glazers out!!!
Passion Trust and Desire FC - OLE
They have been sloppy at the back n they still do this to Liverpool? They deserve it
The player are not playing at 100% , at most is 50% commitment.  The midfield was a shamble , scott , Fred and lastly Progba was bad
We should get Steve Bruce !!! I am serious !!! He will do a better job then Harry Maguire
Olé out 👎
Ole thinks we played well in the 2nd half. Fine margins!!
WE NEED BETTER DEFENCE AND MID FIELD
We need either Zidane or Conte, and I sincerely hope both are currently assembling their coaching staff and planning to make a presentation to the board! We need a change in the management now!
Very reminiscent of wengers time coming to an end. Being embarrassed and fans taking the piss
He should sack himself already. Has he not cost us a lot already? 🤷🏽‍♂️😡😡😡
Arabs n Leceister's board are better than goazers
Ole will always be a Utd Legend. Nothing can take that away from him, but it’s time for him to go.  The only issue is who will replace him? Utd always seem out of sync with what top managers are available. There is currently nobody available that Utd would want.   You can go right back to when Fergie left and we missed out on Pep because he wanted his mate Moyes to take over, then we missed out on Klopp.   Who would replace Ole?
Yipee - He's actually said it -Ole Out - SOS - Save our season - get him out.
Give him more time,
Problem is Medfield and our defend suck
Personally I think that he was a truel' great player, but they are simply not good enough. Get a experienced coach in to steady the ship and turn things around
United's first eleven better than Liverpool player for player? Not a chance! I'm sorry but who is getting in over Salah and VVD? Mane has been better than Rashford this season. Robertson better than Shaw. Trent than AWB.   Honestly, I don't see many United players getting into that Liverpool first eleven. Bruno Fernandes would, Ronaldo obviously. Varane as well ... But who else? Pogba hasn't done it for United.
Pogba. Worst player we ever had?
What pains me is  that the whole world knows they can't win any trophy with OLE but the board is contented with him. Who in the world can c a worker killing his business and he retains him?
Ole & his coaches are clueless.
OLE OUT!
Draining deadwood is still an unresolved problems. Too many friends for employment going on still
You say we were in 3rd gear, but how do we get into 1st gear? We can’t because the opposition aren’t good enough lol
dont worry liverpool lost 7 against aston villa
Mcfred
A Champions team will always win against a team of champions.I don't think Manchester bought the players who were need it,they have great individuals but no team.
Goooood.... Good..... Let the hate flow through you 🧛
The only thing is there’s no mangers available at the moment that could come in and turn the season around
I WANTED HIM OUT FROM HE LET FRED STAY ON THE FIELD TO GET A RED CARD BUT THE EUROPA FINAL WAS THE ICING ON THE CAKE.
Remember last season when he kept playing magalöf and mcfred and we wished for better players this season
Really disappointed today but not surprised ogs a good Man Utd player but not a good Man Utd manager time for a change
It's very painful for his teammates to always cover up for him instead of being fans. I remember how P.Scholes said so many horrible things about Mourinho and now it's time for him to say the truth he is busy being a bloody hypocrite.
Newcastle need a Manager who can stabilise them. Ole will do it. Go for him.
1:01 🤣🤣🤣🤣 hes finally said it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤭
I'm praying..🙏🙏 Keep ole as the United manager. Going forward.😀👍
I thought the score was 14-0
If he cares for the club, he leaves. If he still insists on staying, then there is something wrong with him mentally and shouldn't be in the job anyway, just go!
Ole was only supposed to stay until the end of his first season!
Maguire has been crap ever since we signed him.
You didn’t see us losing ?! I saw this coming from the beginning of the season we are a bad team with a bad manager.
Olly's slipped the wheel He's gonna roll is down the hill He's gonna get us relegated From premier league to championship
Ronaldo should walk out
I would sell Slab head and bring in torres or de ligt
I genuinely believe our squad of 23 players on paper is far better than Liverpools squad, and yet we got absolutely schooled today? Ole please resign as this board dont have the balls to sack ya 😭😭
I told you guys. Liverpool my team are full of legends. Yous it's a different story! I'm so happy.😃👍
Mark you told us you don’t see United losing. You did this for the prev Prem games, stop jyncing us
Player for player United are simply not better than Liverpool, this idea that pogba, rashford et al are brilliant players is just nonsense. The results speak for themselves
I'm loving it.....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gary Neville has been found out
Keep ole in tíl next week at least please... Got kane in my fpl team..
Tactics in football is massively overrated the players are weak mentally
Pogbas got to go
Keane said a year ago these players would throw ole under the bus they did it to mourinho
In what world is Utds XI better than Liverpool?Allison = De hea  Robbo = Shaw Trent > AWB Vvd > Maguire  Matip = Varane Thiago < Fernandes  Fabinho > Fred Hendo > McTomminay Salah > Greenwood Mane > Rashford Firmino < Ronaldo
Managers tend to resign at the end of a season. It is notoriously rare, if not unheard of, for a manager to resign mid-season let alone at a HUGE club. Man Utd bring in Zidane or Conte, or even Brendan Rodgers. All would be licking their lips to manage such a talented squad.
Super Ole in, needs a pay-rise and contract extension.
Sir Alex was shaking his head, enough said.. he thought he was watching liverpool thrashing cardiff city
As useful as waterproof tea bags 😂😂😂👍👍👍
🤡ole🤡
Maguire looks titanic bound
8:54 hahahah yeah ok Mark
Mark's stance of not screaming Ole out as if it's a morally superior thing to do is so weird. Whether you're whispering or blaring it through a speaker, you're still rightfully calling for him to be axed. We just had to endure a battering and you don't expect people to be furious lmao
2:23 Why Did that make me laugh so much. "WITH RONALDO IN THE FUCKING TEAM." 😂😂
Bring in Steve Bruce …
💔
Bruce 4 United
25:30 "Essentially, in footballing terms, were being managed by a bunch of prats"   Classic Mark.
It’s time to go Ole
Nine conceded in two games
please keep Ole forever. He is the greatest manager of all time.
I didn't understood luke shaw positioning all game. Always with maguire in middle instead of guarding the left side. Worst game ever. We got found out as long ball fc and he didnt change tactics. OLE OUT
Mark...a certain Cristiano has Zidane's number too.
Ole out
Funking embracing game. Ole need to walk leave . No compensation should be given if he loves the club. I am not going front of Liverpool  fans for the rest of the year lol.
And this is what us Ole outters have been trying to avoid.   Believe it or not we don't want this result, we said long long long ago that if we didn't sack Ole, there is a potential that these results were just around the corner if Ole continued as manager.   I'm going to say I told you so because so many of us have been told were bad supporters etc - where in fact we support the team and don't just blindly follow a failing manager.  Ole outters give him full credit to where he has brought us to but he cannot take us further. Lack of a DM is not an excuse. City don't play with a traditional no9 yet regularly score 4/5 goals. I don't know what our plan is and it's not just from this season, it's been throughout his tenure. I won't/can't take 3/2nd place finishes away from him but we haven't been a good side. I've seen the likes of Brighton, Villa, Southampton play us off the park at OT, let along Liverpool and City, yes we can beat team but there's never really an obvious formula.  Those who continually wish to justify Ole as manager, this is what you deserve - the rest of us don't deserve this. Look at the talent in this squad and look at how we're playing, can't string 10 passes together. It's embarrassing.
Ole....Please Go
“No thanks we looking for a proper manager” <insert national league team here>
There is no spirit and you cannot expect it from anyone in Man utd now.
Playing Village football.
Ronaldo does no pressing. Are you deluded ? He is part of the problem.😂
Ole and his stuban favourites have come home to roste, get your coat mate
There’s only one man for the job... Roy Keane!
Ole out!
Ole has taken the heat off every other manager in football....the whole week the media will be ALL OVER US!!
Ole out
You think player for player your team is better than ours? Even though we got the best player in the world. Best center half in the world and best fullbacks ?
Maguire has no leadership qualities, or any other qualities.
Brendan Rogers ? ??
Antonio Conte would be better than Zidane!
If Ole care about this club he suppose to resign. Leave Ole!!!!!!!GGMU!!!!!
I think Ole needs more time....love the PL 😂😇😝
Welcome Zidane
Big Sam available to keep United up.
mark spits facts always
Get a proper hard atse manager and if any player complains out you go
pogba is like ravel Morrison or adel taarabt on steroids. 2.0. Rather have a fletcher, park or even mctominay any day because thats man utd ethics. Simple.. look at the fruits of the attempt at flair in this team. One or two attacking flair type players is fine but not 5. Created a monster with this team.  Poor attitudes all round. Moody French and drama queen portugese. Fergie was right to get rid if pogba!!! He knew. He is not true man utd like scholes giggs bruce Neville keane Beckham Ruud Ronaldo schmeichel.   He doesnt suit. Just like veron was technically amazing but didnt suit!
Ole is still learning and developing and has definitely become much more tactically astute he's just having bad luck atm. We have one of the best managers in the league, lets get behind him and support him. OLE IN. GGMU.
Wow Mark... Finally you've said it meaningfully, "Ole OUT!!!".  YUP' we're all hurting..time for a change a real change!!!
Why against Liverpool 😞
He could not pick his nose.
HAHAH the skill ratings 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Interim Manager job- Yes Temporary stability after Mourinho- Yes  Permanent solution in the long term- NO WAY OLE OUT!!!
Scholes spoke the truth after the Atalanta win already. Today, the truth turns to reality. Ole should hold full responsibility for this disaster result. He never really keeps an eye on defence. However, Ole will still manage the team. The disaster will still go on.
You know that I often attack you about always attacking the Glazers for every thing wrong at ManU. Always bemoaning the interest cost and payment of dividends which in the scheme of things is really not out of line. Having said that the Management is terrible mainly for mostly standing by and not recognizing what needs to be done in the area of Leadership, Game strategy, strategy, etc. All the stuff that is critical on the PITCH. BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY CAN MAKE NOW IN BRINGING IN A Conte or other high profile Manager who is only available because they have already failed elsewhere, but demand a long contract at rediculos wages. I am afraid that is exactly what will happen.
Yep poor old Ole needs to have a permanent holiday
OLE OUT!!!!!
Never underestimate the value of a good manager. I hear plenty of City fans (who have short memories) who would actually be glad to see the back of Pep, absolutely ridiculous
The way this team play...we should look to pull Garner up from the u23, also recall tuanzebe & brandon williams...
Lmao those sabotaged scores though 😂
We need three midfielders the ilk of Youri Tielimanns, Ndidi, Yves Bissoma, Rice
CLUELESS MANAGER
Player for player better than Liverpool. That’s hilarious 😂😂😂
Real Madrid lost 5-0 at home to Barcelona in February 1974 during Luis Molowny's first 5 month spell as the manager. He actually finished off that season by winning the Copa del Rey, and returned to manage the team several times over the next decade to bag a load more trophies. I think we can let him off given that the loss was only 5 weeks into his tenure at the helm!
Yeah Jose lost the players, but hasn’t Jose been United’s most successful manager post Fergie?
I just have no idea who Utd would even bring in at this point.. None of the big managers are available...its only Conte & Zidane and im just not confident they will have be a success.
Sorry Ole you’ve got to do one now
1:00 Finally Mark saying the MAGIC WORDS...
Ole should resign.
Now mark is ole out ,Ole 's days are numbered
Ole Out
We want you to stay We want you to staaaaay Ole Ole Ole  We want you to stay
The sad fact of the matter is, Ole is not going to quit and lose out on contract compensation and the board is not ready to fire him, unless share values fall. Get used to results such as today, because without a major upheaval, nothing is going to change.  If Ole really is true to UTD, then he will forgo waiting for dismissal compensation and throw in the towel. Then we can start to sort out the shambles he has created.   My prediction....Pressure will mount for the board  and Ole won't last a week.
Lifetime contract.
Can't be worse than losing 6-1 to city and spurs at ot
Ole, and Maguire has to go... Imagine the worlds most expansive fridge, which is fucking captain of the worlds biggest club, acting like a fucking kitten. Hellfucking no.. Get the lot out... Heads need to be rollin....
Yes marks ole out now something my change I hope
"Tit's on a nun" 😂. Hated the match, least we got that chestnut...
OGS said 'we're too close' means what 🤔🤔...to crumble?
Lmao Manchester is blue
Maguire is crap
The Rats will have a song about this game.
I think everybody's overreacting he is a decent manager. Always positive even after heavy defeats he likes to smile.
Zidane in in the next 24hours
Sack Sack Sack Sack
Lol
8 points off the top, yes. The more relevant stat is that United are just 7 points above the side 4th from bottom. By December United could be on the fringes of a relegation scrap and back in the Europa league. Get Ole out now. S.O.S (Save Our Season)!
Those are Liverpool fans rating .....none of the United fans dont even wana rate United players
a person who speaks his mind thank the lord
Ole ruined Donny's Career  He disrespected Lukaku  He overworked Bruno and Rashford last Season and ruined there Euros! Karma's out to get him 😈
I hate Man Utd . I am a Liverpool supporter .I think Ole at the Wheel is fantastic.I am embarrassed
Maguire is a problem. lindelof being held back by maguire
Time for Ole to go
Van Dijk is 6' 4 and 93kg/almost 15 stone.  He bounced Ronaldo off his chest.   You wouldn't have two footed him, man. Let's not be silly.
Brilliant post.  Spot on
What an idiot.Definetly not a footballer.
I think Fergie will intervene and convince Solskjaer and the board to let him resign.
What happened to "I won't say Ole out cuz the board won't sack him" 😁 prat 😁😁😁
So many obvious faults that the fans can see, but Ole and the coaching team can't, put Ronaldo in the middle and not supply him...even though we bought a fucking 72 mill winger....in the presser he said Fred must be good cause Brazil pick him.....clueless.
As a wise man once said.... It's time to go !   (Unbiased opinion)
Solskjaer has no more excuses. We have the squad to challenge for major honours.
Lingard would have had a better chance of winning the title if he stayed at West Ham 😁😁😁
Fake Fans want Ole out. Not me though, Ole at the wheel.
13:10 "I'm not screaming Ole out"  Title of your video in all caps: "OLE OUT!"
basic football just mark one on one to defend
6.8 ole 😂
Ole in 🙏
Fergie lost 6-1 to man City and came back but for me the most worrying thing today was the downing tools after like 2-0. With the likes of conte and Zidane available I'd be looking at them but there are other managers out there ten hag for instance
Ole’s favouritism his downfall! Karma
Watching Neville's give  ole more time talk was the saddest thing I saw today
Why would he leave and not get his millions?
Ole gots to go 😓
You were ole in   should  have seen the  rot Europa league  final   hes never a manager   never
I think de gae has been class recently but he was a 5 maybe a 6 today not good today
OGS is no SAF and He's tooooo F-ing STUBBORN and he wont leave.. Comeon Board - Show him the door!
better defenders than reds have now. Sven Botman..Alessandro Bastoni,,Edmond Tapoba..Jules Kounde..Achraf Hakimr..Kalidou Koulibaly..Ben white..Dayot Upamecano....Better midfieders reds have now.Lucas Paqueta ...Jordan..Fabian Riuz...Wataru Endo...Wilfred Ndidi...Declan Rice...Xaver Schlager..Tiemoue Bakayoko........Just a thought as better quality required. OUT Maguire,,Wan-Bissaka,,,Lindeloff...McTominay...Fred...Cavani...Sancho
Why awb shaw magiure at the back all are a mess can’t get in a position to save their life awb pressing a player greenwood was already marking for jota goals shaw and magiure running into eachother not for the first time this season aswell telles should be brought in Bailey and varane and put dalot on
5nil 🤡🤡🤡🤡
I see how it is talking about Swindon my home club 😂😂😂😂
Today was a truly sad day. However.. The saddest part was how Mark didnt confirm his votes so we could see who was MOTM. That was a thick layer of frosting on the cake.
I have seen 50 year old plumbers working harder at a sunday league game than half the man u team today
Mark has a potty mouth😂
Didn't do player ratings there was nothing to rate
EVEN SIR ALEX LEFT EARLY. CHEESUS.
The club will never replicate what sir Alex did working with these owners. People need to realise sir Alex was a one in a life time manager, doesn’t matter who we get in to replace olly the same will happen again. It’s the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result. I’m sorry to all the united fans but you are always going to be screwed with these owners.
We have not played Chelsea and Man City yet. Can't even think far
We miss Dan James lol
Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there -- given what he's done since he's come in -- and let him sign the contract and go..  Ole's at the wheel, man -- he's doing his thing. Man United are back!
Ole is the best manager since A. Ferguson. You won´t get any better.
Maguire is useless, can't be dropped because he's English and cost so much. He's NOT a leader. His interview after the game said it all, clueless. United will wait until we are out of all competitions before they make a change.
Ole, all coaching staff, Maguire, Lindelof, McTominay, Fred need binning
OLE OUT !
Who is going to take over though?
Utd fans should stop blaming Ole, it's on the players
Life is good
I’ve seen pub teams defend better.
We all love Ole but ole out.
Go watch the coverage of the post match coverage on sky, talking about if cr7 has been bad for united
Lmao Barca wouldn’t sack ole right now😂
Tomorrow morning he's gone
Alot of Ole’s favourites will be dropped if we get a ball playing manager
Bringing  Zaiden   the  biggest  mistake  Glazer  wil   commit   too   Zaiden  is  a  failer  . He  need  hundred  of  galaticos  to  win
Can’t wait for 6th place 😀
Ole out A.S.A.P... before Man Utd suffer even more
Sorry Ole. Love you man. But you gotta go.
Lossing   is  not  a  sin  why  cannot loss  why  need to  win all the  time    why  making  noise  let  ole  run the show   dont  disturb  him   give  him  a  full season    ole  in  .
When Ole got behind the wheel, the road ahead was clouded by fog. The fog has now cleared and revealed a dead end. Why go down that road any further? Time to turn back once again…
Harry Maguire can not play in a 2 against top opponents. He is absolutely horrendously
Ole can see signs of improvements   Ole at the wheel🤣🤣🤣
"Maguire couldn't lead a pack of ants to a picnic" 😂😂😂😂😂
Noooooooo
Disgrace. The board accpets medicority, and its resignated with some of our fans. Protest the Glazers. Get the leeches out.
My dad has been Ole in since the beginning and he’s finally Ole out today
Give  OLe  the  full season   let  him do  the  job  dont  b a pest  everything  is  ok  for  know    v  lost  6- 0  to spurs  last  season     no  problen why  now   need to   make   noise   v wil  win  the  next  game
“They may as well go and play for Swindon” 🤣
How many man United managers will Klopp sack lol 😂
Maguire is useless £80mill a stop 🤣🤣 the only thing he seems to block is ollies eyes. Found out big time tonight and will be found out the rest if the season
Long before this match united have been misfiring. Ole is definitely not up to the task to manage a top team.
Please don't say we lost 5-0 ...we all know they could have ended it 10-0 easily ...they have simply decided to respect our dignity 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Can someone confirm that the Manchester United that used to dominate english football, I'm starting to think its just a myth. If only I could watch all those legends
"As useless as a waterproof teabag" / "As useless as tits on a nun" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 where do you get these things out of
Let's go Ole! He said accept the responsibility, so do the Lampard please! He said he is getting close... indeed...close to turning MU into a championship team! What happens to DVB? Why Sancho's not playing in his natural right wing? Why keep playing McFred? Why pick Harry McGuire a captain when he just arrive and yet so many seniors with better leadership quality. So his tactics is to pick players that he likes than consistent above average performance? Actually the biggest culprit is the board. He was supposed to be interim and the said plan was to hire a permanent (suitable) manager after the season ends.
Gosh the jokes and the fun being made against Manchester United  on social media is unending.I've never seen anything like it in my life.
The club are like a dinghy drifting out to sea away from the rest awaiting to be rescued.
In premier league arsenal a bigger rival than liverpool
I bet Ronaldo regrets joining UTD instead of City now
Disgusting, disgraceful and totally unacceptable. Playing on high heels .
Zidane as a Manager and Roy Keane as an Assistant Manager.
That game was painful to watch. I never seen my self saying this but Ole need to go. He is a legend and a nice guy that’s all he is.
Make Ronaldo Player-Manager
Waterproof teabag 😂😂
Bring in Bielsa
Love Ole. It’s time to move on.
Two foot VVD? His actions were not as bad as Ronaldo's. Who could have been sent off. You lost all over the pitch!
Cr7 should be the fuckin captain
Ole in he's doing a fantastic job give him a lifetime contract we schooled you today and loved every second of it
Feel bad for all utd fans. Honestly. I watch because mark knows what he’s talking about. the loyalty is unprecedented. Very admirable
Watching match of the day. Listening to micah richards and co ripping ole and the coaching staff apart. This is embarassing. Wish ole wood grow a set and either sack his coaching staff or walk away from old trafford. I fear for ole wif man city coming soon
Come for the football, stay for the analogies
yes its true, he should know himself, he took the club as far as he can, time to quit, dont wait till people to sack you, before his legendary status gets tarnished
The best managers have a fear factor ole doesn't have
You can’t expect ole to resign. He has a multi-year contract and he’s never getting another big job. They need to buy him out.
Ole at the wheel. Trust the process. We (Liverpool fans) want Ole to stay
I would say the worst Manager United have EVER had totally inept useless clueless  !! Time to resign …but he WONT !
Wow rival fans getting in on the player ratings, what a farce this is, ole was a 2
Horrible day to loose in that way no passion the defence was terrible. United need a real captain to lead.
If ole really cares he'd step down himself
Ole don't give more than this, he's very weak manager, and Maguire my God, it's one of the weakest center defenders i see, and i'm 54 years old.
Even our wins have been scrappy and miracle comebacks at times, Ole out please, no excuses!!!!!!!
This has been coming for a long time. We have been playing shite.  And it’s not just losing it’s the way we lost .Liverpool were like a spider playing with a fly. Tactically inept from the board  to the manager. The tea ladies may be playing midfield against Spurs
Ole has to go, disgraceful result.
I'm done
Any why is Van de Beek not getting any minutes is beyond me... Zidane can save United
Gary Neville has become an embarrassment to this club. Still won’t speak the truth. I’m so sick of him now and every of these ex players. Such a shame.
Maguire sounded like Orville in his interview 😄
If you two footed VVD you’d bounce off you sausage
Ole isn’t leaving according to him we are so close, close to what exactly? City, Liverpool and Chelsea are years ahead of us.
Real Madrid lost 5/1 to Barcelona and a day later Lopetegui was fired.
Next time anyone compares united cb and full backs to Liverpools then rewatch this game and have a word with yourself!
ITS TIME TO GO
Gold ridge you are a hypocrite. Sympathising for ole and hatred for mourinho
The man is a joke.He WAS SIGNING autographs after the heavy defeat against liverpool.Instead of handing his resignation he had the guts to sign autographs!!!!!!
Ole out tonight
"We are tits on a nun" lol kkk
Why was OLE the manager .
The old players who are pandit must apologise to Mourinho and beg him to come back and save the club. Support him fully
Is it a coincidence that since Pogba’s post match comments after the defeat to Leicester he has been on the bench since. Similarly to how Donny has been completely frozen out since his interview with Ferdinand and the throwing of the chewing gum. Two players he probably needs the most. Ole doesn’t like criticism. He sticks to his favourites and ultimately that will be his downfall.
Lmao saying you'd 2 foot VVD is 🤡🤡🤡 behaviour. The fact no one two footed Ronaldo for what he did... Plus, the little-big man that has to back him up... Good luck Pogba on the reverse fixture 😂
But who comes in? Why would be quit and leave 5m on the table? No chance
😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣What a disgrace.
7 to DeGea……
A few more bad trashing in likes to Man City or Arsenal next international  break Ole is toast..☠⚰
I WAS AT GAME TDAY WI MA BOY AN U KNOW WOT THEY TOOK THE PISS
Salah is the first player in PL history to score a hat trick at OT. That stings man.
You're on FIRE today, bruv!  🔥👏😂🏆💯
So, who should be manager?
RantBridge
If you didn't know "last year" that games like this would continue to happen under Ole and this team then you don't know futbol.
Ole was outclassed.He needs to leave immediately.
when the fans start leaving i started feeling it, ole has to go
Ole out and Zidane In !
Yea I wanted to punch my tv when van dijk charged at Ronaldo😤
Mark OLE is still the man for United come on OLE
“Liverpool didn’t even play that well” - mate it was 0-5😂
Mark you saying “there is a human being in Ole “ nothing is wrong with that, but he should realize there is a human being in donny as well and for that reason he gets not a ounce of sympathy from me.
So sad I have to be reminding myself of the love we all have for Ole. Smh
Now u said ole out ? All the coaching staff sack includ ole.. again n again poor tactic
Love Ole. Ole in
Its not the players ffs its a coaching lesson for Ole, the players are doing what there told.Mike Bassett
it's not Ole fault. he's not the one playing.
ManU needs a manager who can figure out, put together a plan and a team with so many superstars.  The players are not at fault, they were brought in to play for ManU because they can play and proven winners !!!
Haahhahahahahaahhaahhahhahhahhaahhhaahhhhahahahaahahhh
Plan-B for Man Utd. is to change ends at half time ;D
The best part was seeing Fergie's face that was priceless 😂😂
i never laughed so much when the player rating came lol wtf just happened
Mark has seen the light
Fergie shaking his head said it all. Ole should quit now.
Was this a guy who said Man Utd is way more batter then Liverpool.? 5-0? Whos better now? Ha?
MARCELO BROZOVIC IS ANSWER FOR YOUR DM TROUBLES, FAST, RUNS AS MCTOMINAY OR MORE, HAS A PASS, HAS A SHOT, HAS LITERALLY EVERYTHING.
All players and manager deserve 10's  😂
Ole still thinks he’s improving the team 😂 now my friend is delusional
Can't blame the players   they do on the pitch what they are told and what they train every day
I feel ya lads,,, seriously i feel ya✌🏽 The feeling of not having progress when you started with optimism is just depressing!  I'm happy today, but as Klopp Said, its about respect
Sign Varane Ronaldo and Sancho and get worse instead of better ? Thats 100% on the manager Zidane in or Conte im a bit reserved on Cone as hes defensive so im told but anyone is better than Ole at this point
I think they will sack him after Spurs game not now.Kane will score hatrick next week..
Ole please please don't be self,you must leave,you can't able to future Manchester United,it's time for you now to step down
Who the fcuk are man utd? Who the fcuk ate man utd? Who the fcuk are man utd ? As the reds go marching on on on !!
Tuanzebe and Varane might be a quality partnership. Throwing that one out there
It should have been seven or eight.
Ole = Wilf McGuinness: Moyes was Frank O'Farrell, Van Gaal Tommy Doc, Mourenho Dave Sexton.  We need the next Sir Alex.
You say: we shouldn’t be openly bashing Solskaer or you’re a dickhead…normally I would agree with you but Ole brought in on himself as a coach (Still respect the player). He’s the one who treated us like children during every interview, he’s the one who said “Trophies are for egos”, “We have to make bold decisions with the team (After Atalanta) and then PLAYS THE SAME FKIN TEAM, giving us the “We got to get up for the next one” every week, etc.  He deserves to be bashed for his stubbornness, his patronizing attitude and to act like he’s some genius tactician.
Bin the whole club and Phoenix it
Spot on Mark, but this has been coming.
Alex Ferguson (who is the man in charge) will not get rid of Ole!
It’s a disgrace we were humiliated!
Ole out
And then Fans want Zidane to replace him. Remind me any game Zidane got his tactics right, he always got saved by Ronaldo and that World class Real squad. He is an awful tactician so I can see us coming back to this discussion in three years time if we appoint Zidane
Olé looked mildly annoyed at times.
Pure rage today sorry 😠
Get ole out , bring in Zidane.
😁
When Harry met Salah ☺️
“This Liverpool team looks very beatable.” Idiot.
They wouldnt get in the Swindon team
Maguire too slow  Bassika no attack too much slides Fred - shocking no goals  Lindalof can’t be trusted  Fernandez hit and miss
Yes Fred McTominay and a coach even Martial, but come on MAGUIRE RASHFORD and even SHAW have been showing signs. But no one have been saying this only until now after this defeat.
I personally believe if united we’re playing Man City or Liverpool and they had 10 men we would still loose that’s how bad united are atm.
"...as useful as a packet of waterproof tea bags"😂😂😂
Ole out
We all said this exactly a year again and you were ole in then. Suck it up princesses
Ole must just walk away
Enough is enough this ain’t right this takes the piss
They will bounce back. Last year they lost 1-6 to spurs and they finish 2nd. Its too early to judge
Cr7 for captain...must lead united out if relegation..defence is shocking McGuire has to go..no.midfield..the style of soccer has to complement  the strikers u nited don't have a style..full support to cr7 legend the king , must be the captain to lead united, rashford, lingard, cavani, sancho, Bruno all class.. my support this is united strike force..coach is a nice guy, respect for his goals but no tactical knowledge..  this flows to the top..bring back the dream team glory years, soccer is religion..
Sickening to see this play out. I am totally beyond it. Man Utd can kiss my...!!!
Goldbridge IN!
I just still cannot except mctominay in middle with his little jog to press liv player.. what a joke man.. is this come from player that ole trust??.. OLE OUT.. enough is enough.. sorry ole..
Ole out
Ole in 🙌
I watched it in the pub I’ve never been so embarrassed couldn’t even go for a piss without Liverpool fans taking the piss ole will be a legend forever but as a manager it’s time to go
De Gea said we play like kids
🌱
"Ole at the wheel"
Ole innnnn
I blame fans like mark and all the fans that are following him on this channel. You were all Ole in for three years and it has led to this. If you had seen it earlier then he would have been gone now. But fans like mark are the reason he’s still in the job because you wanted to give him time and time and time again and again. Now you all want him out whilst the damage has been done. We are stuck with a 36 year old Cristiano Ronaldo. We have Harry maguire at the back with an overrated shaw and wan-bissaka. We have no midfield and Pogba is about to leave. We have our hopes being carried by bruno fernandes who was being compared to cantona but some fans which is a disgrace itself. Mark wanted to give ole time and he should be happy with this
I said it from the word go…..he hasn’t a clue. He needs to go ASAP
5 times.................................................................
With a one year delay.
Mark, it’s Mourinho’s fault that Ole is at the wheels.
Not sure why no-one has mentioned why pogba getting a red and walking off smiling. Most overrated player I've ever seen. And neville still trying to defend ole how embarrassing
Mark finally saying Ole out😭😭😭
Look who the fk is talking about favorites. Mark uve backed Ole all the way because he's ur favorite. We utd fans who saw this from last season knew this was coming. We TOLD YOU THIS FROM LAST SEASON.
He finally said ole out ? Did I here that or it’s my Internet
Mark so are you officially Ole out.? Cause you are saying he has to go. Say it for us mark say you are Ole out.
They need to get rid of Ole, the coaches, Fred, Maguire,  Mctominay, Shaw, Lindelöf, and bring in a worldclass manager to fix the problems.
THE RECKONING HAS COME 🌑🌑🌑🌑🌑🌑  Now do you believe me! The WORST DAY EVER!  How did He get the job?????
We deserve better than this, with the quality that we have we deserve a quality manager, enough is enough, we deserve better.
Atleast we didn't lose 0-6..... 😒
Manchester United is a dysfunctional organization from top to bottom. Pick any name within the organization and you can have many long conversations of how each person is inconsistent, inept, unorganized, and indecisive. I’ve always been Ole out because I’ve never thought he was the right person for the job but this is not all about him. We are an abysmal organization and that’s being nice.
Getting a DM wasn't even going to be expensive. Lots of good players were available for dirt cheap and some were even free. Ole quite simply decided not to get one which highlights another aspect of his incompetence
Ole is damned if he stays on & Ole is damned if he goes now at this moment in time!
This has been coming for months. Papering over cracks does not work. Goodbye Ole.....
He needs to go now. We need our club back
Damn I want Jose back. loved him. he was right all along. yes he lost the players. he lost the players that belong in the trash can. good for him that he lost them.
Men versus Boys today from the team the Manager and the Coaching Staff.
Whatever happens with ole the manger. it will have no effect on his legacy as a player!
Why is Ten Haag’s name not even being mentioned? He’s probably the most suitable manager for us who we can get right now. The next managerial appointment is as important as getting rid of Ole and post-Fergie we haven’t got that right once.
But what are you really saying ??
You talk shite Goldberg... You moan that the coaches are jobs for boys but you want owners to be jobs for boys
Ty JK for exposing this fraud to anyone who was blinded.
Well said 100% agree
There is nothing new here. There is only one answer. It is Zidane.
The defensive shape is horrendous at one point we had wan bisakka, lindelof and maguire all right back and nobody in the middle absolutely nuts
Ole IN !
It should be like Germany were the season ticket owners own half the club
United people like Neville who do whatever to back Ole??? Are u sure mark
I wanna hear what got to say the most clueless football analysts Mr. Gary Naville.
relaxxx... manu will bounce back. remember 6-1 against tth last year. give him time lol
Glazers will dump Man.Utd to the ground in the upcoming years.
"Tits on a nun" Mark? Them tits are more useful than the players we've got.
Professional footballers? Come on mate! That bloody lot didn't show the skill or conviction to even work in a soup kitchen to feed disadvantaged kids! Hell, I wouldn't even trust them to peel the sack of potatoes!
Fans hated mourinho and he won three trophies with the club. Ole has won nothing with a far better team
ole first  wrong move was giving maguire captain of this club,n then hire his fiends who dont know football.ole out
The saddest thing is we are going to see the same team next week
Why is it all I've seen today is how bad Moyes was at Utd? Utd gave him 6 months. Look what he's done at my club, in a year. Are you telling me you wouldn't have him back over Ole? You are clueless if you wouldn't. Maybe Moyes has got his payback now and the praise he deserves.
Maguire is a dressed piece of wood. Shaw is  fat and antiathletic. Lindelof is simple a joke, same goes for your prized Varane, but did not play today. Fred only knows to run and so on.  Months ago I commented about Maguire and Varane being outdated type of defenders.  I love Ole but he is out of his depth. He must leave before he destroys his legacy. It's not his fault alone but he should have done better choices during the transfer window, especially when it comes to defence.
One of the main reasons I love to watch this channel is because you say things that the dip shitz excuse the language in the Press are not allowed to or refuse to say
I said to someone Liverpool will hammer us 5.0 I was right man city will do the same to us 5.0 to man city the board won't get rid of ole is got more lives than a cat ole as to go is clueless and hopeless at the same time. If this continues man u won't get top 4 with ole in charge still the only way man u will get top 4 is with a top class manager and ole ain't that so expect more pain to come it's only gonna get worse
If any manager comes in first thing he will do is he will start VDB And Sancho in every match.
Ride on goldbridge.
All the top clubs in Europe would sack their manager in this situation. Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Bayern, Juve etc all sacking him. Longer he stays the more damage thats done now. Nice guy, club legend but f*cking clueless manager.
Ole in all the way
Tottenham was embarrassing cos it's Tottenham  but this was humiliating  much more pride involved and rivalry as well as competition :(
0-5 was flattering, Liverpool didn't even need to click into a higher gear.
"Listen, Man Utd might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Ole's at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. Man Utd are BACK."
Saw the writing on the wall first few minutes in when Fred  blasted the ball out for a throw after winning it back.  The camera cut too Klopp laughing at Fred.
Mark you are the praat for just realizing that he needs to go,he should have been gone from end of last season or before
You attack more Fred am Mc but McGuirr is worse.
We got absolutely battered today like we were a Norwich, that is not on. That was an absolute embarrassment. If the board doesn't make the right decision, then I worry for the club I love.
A bloody disgrace indeed. Heads must roll this time around.
Wow marks tune changed after this 👏 👌
Should of been 15-2 LFC  turned it into a training session,  ... No no no no please keep ole,  please!
He has to go blud
Top what ?
Told ya ages ago he would come around to OLE OUT
Give 'im time to resign.
This community needs to hold Mark accountable for some of the things he says. How does he only realize now that Ole is shocking as a coach ?? For me he was waiting for Ole out to be fashionable and for the boohoo man and manscapped sponsorship deals 🤡🤡
Gary Neville said after the game,give Ole until the end of the season 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪Carra asked him "If there is best manager in the world available would you take him" and Neville said no. 🤔
give him 12 hours to resign- otherwise its the sack- never seen anyone in a job be so far out of their depth
No excuse. Spend obscene amounts on players. Shocking team of individuals with a third rate manager.
We are currently in relegation form..think on this!!
"Liverpool biggest rivals" dont flatter yourselves thats city 😂😂
I love ole but Fred got him fired and he deserves it
Two feet van dyk, day made but im gutted man how did this happen
we need varane
you got raided on your player ratings.
Long may this continue. U guys deserve Ole.
He can’t think that any side wouldn’t fire Ole.  Mark, can you think of any side that would hire him? Plymouth wouldn’t want him.
Didn't realise Cardiff united still wore red.
Was today's result the Glazers fault Marky??  🤡
Sancho got to be regreting going man utd just to sit on the bench
Someone give Ole a contact extension 😂
Wouldnt shock me if Steve Bruce isnt considered ..  nothing surprises with this bored .
Ole dosnt care about  the club
I’m not mad I’m disappointed
How many Liverpool fans are here for the meltdown?
We’re going backwards…it’s disrespectful to even call us United…players taking the piss out of the shirt and the club
Mark u absolutely deserve Ole bcos you've been backing him (blindly) 🤡
Ten Haag, Conte, Zidane they are all better than this man....WTF HAS HE EVEN ACHIEVED
Tested I meant twatted
Get ten Haag in now!
We should sign kessie
Sackable offence this. Ole's already a legend, now he must become history.
Since the Scouse are your biggest rivals I guess you won’t mind too much when you get tested by little Citeh…..
Yeah he is going to walk away from that new fat contract he signed!!  You wouldn’t.
Do a stats check on Ronaldo who gets half a million each week on how many times he touched the ball or made runs
I can't think of a football club in the world who gets 100million every season from the board and still blames the board
What on earth are those defensive ratings? Y’all should be ashamed.
In Ole We Trust
I hope the board backs Ole! He needs more time! He's is a man united man!!! Ole at the wheel!!! For life!!!!
There is a one massage to respond to pass to united`s management just resign . if he cares united more than anyone else . we can not say go but to resign is the best for him for everyone .
Man utd bought a goat 🐐 Liverpool used the goat to celebrate salah🤣🤣🤣🤣
we're slowly turning into Arsenal  Arsenal even have a style of play and are gaining points comfortably  how the tables have turned...
At last you have said your an OLE outer
Ole is a legend but I think it's time he went
Saying he would of took out vvd lol vvd would knocked him out
Ole’s answers are so vague and general. Clearly he doesn’t have the technical knowledge to know why things aren’t working. Ole Out.
It’s sad that Fred, De Gea and Ronaldo were the only ones who looked like they were playing for the shirt today
Tits on bull mate as useless as tits on a bull.zidane in i fuckinh fed up a ole he’s in over his head with the grade a players he’s in control of he needs to go he’s a championship manager not a league winner Europe winning manger
🤣
The player ratings made me laugh so hard. I knew rival fans boosted everyone’s rating 😂😂 fair play
It’s a joke we was trying to press Liverpool? We haven’t ever pressed in the hole time ole has been here so we decided to do it against Liverpool absolute joke !
I guarantee United will beat Atalanta and Spurs and all will be forgotten
Now united fans finally realise what us chelsea fans had to go through with lampard. It was heartbreaking to see him go but it was for the best.
This great old club dosent deserve this its tarnishing fergies record & disrespects all that man utd is for gods sake ole GO
Zidane or conte aren’t the answer by the way
The arsenal has now the same points as the Giant title contender man utd 😂😂😭😭
ole should go should go no idea what was hes doing with all his staff
Ole says he is staying
He’s got to go blud
I blame the agents,  maguires agent got a wedge for selling us that tripe. Leicester laughing. They put more effort into their hairstyles. Than running around.
Warning signs were there 12 months ago when we lost 6-1 to fucking spurs! Id never seen us play as bad until that match in 25 yrs watching utd
This result doesn't surprise anyone tbh and that's saying something.
Conte left Inter because the board at inter didnt live up to his expectations to improve his squad therefore he left. Now would the glazers put in a manager like that in charge? so I think Zidane will be the next manager for manchester united.
The worst thing is I can't see our incompetent board giving Ole the sack tonight/tomorrow
It's been long overdue bcoz Ole Tactics are shambolic,man utd have failed for 3yrs every football basics under Ole.The worst is yet to come.
It's bn said on this channel for nearly two years that Ole persistent in picking Lindelof/Maguire and Fred/Mctominay will in the end sack himself.
The problem is defense they lost on the pitch to many goals the defensive is a huge problem in the ... You fix the back you go front you fix your foundation from the back to front midfielder cant even play whit thr back
I don't think Ronaldo ever lost 0-5 in his career did he? Ole has done real damage to Ronaldo's legacy now.
Zizou left our club twice without compensation because of his love and respect for the team. I pray Ole is the same for you guys.
Everyone knew that McFred were never good enough. But still he plays them week in week out. Liverpool never played Mane but Bruno will play with McFred bcoz Ole loves them
Big Ron coming out of retirement 😛
How about biesla at the job, high tempo attacking play, just the way we like
Man Utd are equal in points with Arsenal. Let that sink in
With what is going on in the world this really isn't a big deal.
Maguire is absolutely awful. He’s slow, laboured, reads the game poorly, tactically inept, technically not the best and best best of all can’t defend! Always square and dives in.  He can however head the ball which is useful if you play for Burnley (I.e his level) at best!
Ole the best manger of all time, there is no other manager in history “managed” to get opposition teams to win.
We should have never let Bayern grab Julian Nagielsmann
Kevin Keegan resigned at England saying "I'm not up to this level" Ole staying hurts the team with each passing week.
Mark if they bring Southgate in I will be done with club full stop…
We know Ole believes he's learnt from SAF, but SAF was an excellent man manager that would get the best out of players by playing to their mentality and what he needed. If SAF's advice to Ole was to go out there and play with energy and desire, to get a shot off etc, then that one fragment from SAF was what he thought it was that made the manager. He must've also seen SAF's ability to appreciate everybody and believe in them in every position, but he wasn't one who was on the end of a harsh decision, and doesn't realise SAF could see what potential was in a player and that if he wasn't good enough, he'd be gone.  It's just conjecture. But all I ever hear from Ole is this energy and desire mindset, and a complete lack of tactical awareness. I just can't fathom why he's so stubborn and oblivious.
Maguire out , Fred out , ole out problem fixed
Water proof tea bags 😂😂
Get in Zidane or CONTE I want a Ferocious winner at the helm if the players or board don't provide I want it called out, I want ACOUNTABILITY !
He says he won't give up "He's come too far" but honestly what else can he do what he couldn't have done already, it's more excuses FC or stalling FC, bet Cardiff City fans are saying "Told you so"
Finally Ole Out Mark
I’d feel sorry for Ole. But then I remember his treatment DVB and now Sancho. He’s done this to himself. We spent a WHOLE SEASON talking about a lack of a right sided player and needing Sancho. Only for Sancho to sit on the bench. I’ve said it and I’ll say it again, he leaves these players out coz he doesn’t know what to do with them.
The only funny thing about this is it took a huge Liverpool defeat for many Man Utd fans to get outraged. I always thought Ole was not the one. And many thought i was a traitor. 🤣🤣🤣 maybe this time we can protest his ass out
Mark isn't yelling "Ole out". He's just saying it.  Video titled "OLE OUT!"...  It's okay Mark, it's time to shout it.
Well you wouldn’t have two footed Van dijk would you, he’d of knocked you in to 2027
He needs to go with the staff aswell new regime in people who can mould a competent team and a vision for success
I like Graham potter and Erik ten haag for the managerial role
Why is harry maguire a captain??? De Gea, Ronaldo or even Varane would make better captains.
ManU Need good things, ole is good but not suitable for this level of game
The board has to act. 2+ yrs , he got everything n everyone n hasn’t won nothing. Ole out
Aimé Jacquet for United
Thanks for the therapy Goldbridge to help with such a shocking afternoon
I've been saying ole is tactically useless for about a year n a half and many times I've been seen as a bad supporter but i guess ole has proven me right
hate this club even though i surrport man u
Out out out ole get your bags and Carrick and phelan out embarrasing
GG
Ole in
Just watching Scholes talk about the game, I don't know why there asking the ex united mates there still biased, i wouldn't give them air time, be honest for Christ's sake, the manager and tactics were shocking at home, is that the worst defeat at OT, everyone knocks Spurs, didn't they beat us this time last year and there next
Ole in!!!!!
Let's just come together and kidnap the whole coaching staff then force the board to hire new coaches
But Ole said him and his staff are close to getting the team they are building. Wtf???
Mourinho lost 5 nil to barcelona and survived
This match exposed everything we knew was wrong but has so far been masked by shear luck and individual moments of brilliance.
Let us protest
When I did the ratings 10 mins before the end all the results were way lower, so it's been sabotaged
mark you should go ole out enough is enough !!!! we are Manchester united!!!
One of the worst transfers in football history is Harry Maguire. He has no sense of positioning, no skills to hold the defense, no capacity to captain the team, no vision to prevent opposition's attacks. I feel absolute shame when I remember criticizing Phil Jones for his performance after I watch this disaster. Man United should go through a cleansing process of getting rid of players and technical staff that are opposite to clubs tradition, and culture. The club is physically and mentally fragile. United was relying on Sir Alex's tactical genius but never thought that he one day will end his career, that was the biggest mistake that the club ever made. I hope the club makes a wise decision in getting the right man, but not just to make up the day.
This is Not even a question. Ole out!
1:02 mark is officially ole out.correct decision from mark :)
Eric ten hag please
He dug his own grave ! He should step down
“Tits on a nun FC” brilliant
The pundits are still blaming the players instead of blaming the Glazerr & Ole who are the real culprit both them out.
This team needs conte, not Zidane,team needs a manager that can sort this defence,if Zidane comes in I feel nothing will change with goals conceded.
Ole in it coukd be pep or kloop dame result players are at fault not good enough done get clouded ffs
Drop the player's wages very sad day today for united Oles clearly lost the dressing room I dont know what carrick's advice is giving Oles is.
I keep saying he is no good an the couching is very poor he need to go he nite good enough
Scholes called it after the Atalanta win. He said we'd get battered if we played in the same way.
More than that, it's like watching a funeral.  Just short of tears from the manager and players.
Find it funny how he criticizes Arsenal fans for wanting Arteta out but it’s ok for him and United fans that want Solksjaer out.
We need a coach of zidane, Ten hag or Conte. But I'd prefer ten hag cause of the best plays and attack. The macfred system does not work and in the second half it felt safe playing with the 3.5.2 system works better but it shows ole is so poor at tactics as of now i still feel ronaldo can stilll be more better playing with cavani upfront with a 3.5.2 system. VDB presses even more better and is essentialy defensive in a more compact system, sancho tracks back much better than greenwood.
This is my Saddest Day as United Supporter.
Give us Bayern,give us psg,give us Man City  Said a kid after learning how to punch
Can't wait for united vs City. We will humiliate united worse than Liverpool
Basic club 🔴❤️
I love Ole, but please STOP embarrassing us...
OLE FOREVER... 🤣🤣
I disagree with everything you've said You can't sack olly  He needs a long term contract 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Welcome to this feeling! We had this for 15 yeats with Wenger.
It did happen to Madrid and Jose was in charge
Neville still wasn’t having it .he was actually really defensive towards him when questioned by carragher  Unbelievable 😳
Oli doesn't deserve any abuse, he will  always be a legend at the club and loved,but he's taken us as far has he can,time for change, and let the new manager bring in their own coaches.
Imagine laughing at Arsenal all season now ur on level points 😂😂
Manchester United board doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result every time. Well you know the saying...
GGMU 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We need to revamp the entire set up. We have incompetent coaching staff, we have incompetent board members, we are incompetent tactically, analytically, and so many other ways, we need to do everything over again.   Get Conte or Zidane in, and let them sell the players they don't need, I'd sell McFred and Pogba, use Bruno, Donny and get Kessie. Conte and Zidane can do the job 10x better than Ole.
I think that united didn't give jose mourinho time if he had this team he would've won the ucl and pl
It is time, the time is now, Ole it's been nice, will you please GO NOW!
ManU as a team was well United towards the end of last season and we have lost it after Ronaldo came in. Too much importance given to Ronaldo has actually affected the entire team..the team as a whole is totally divided... still everyone gives too much importance to Ronaldo 👎
Liverpool your biggest rivals have a day off
Absolutely shocking, Ole and Maguire are rubbish.
Stop will ya Liverpool have a better first eleven.
I can’t I lost it when he went through the ratings 😂😂😂
McGuire is a waste of space, bissaka is poor, lindelof a joke
U say every word better then me,,, u are the best and say what nonebody want to hear!
Zidane, zidane, zidane, the only one who can deal with those egos
get zidane or conte now
Why can't Zidane come in, why can't we make a move that shows the world we mean business again, I I no idea where we go from here 🤷‍♂️
Please Please don't sack him!!
Ole out ffs
Even without blaming ole. .the players should know how to play.THEY DONT
I wish liverpool would lhave  thrashed us 8 nil or more  so this board can finnaly recognise  thatvike isny the man
But but but I thought United were going to win the league
YOU ALL RAGS SAID: IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD PLAYERS YOU CAN WIN THE LEAGUE, ANY COACH CAN DO THAT… 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂  THATS WHY PEP IS THE BEST MANAGER IN THE WORLD, MANCHESTER CITY BUY COMMITTED PLAYERS NOT “DIVAS”
The squad is not as good as United fans think.
Lambs led by sheep. Ronaldo is the trouble caused by his ego.
Big Sam is available......
I mean is it Ole or the players 🙇‍♂️
Steve Bruce is available..
Still you want to sit on Fence mark??
The board will not sack Ole as he’s a YES man for them he should resign tonight!!!
Ole is not gonna leave. He's gonna hang on, so still believing that he's right in his game plan.
Against Spurs 1-6 Against Liverpool 0-5 Ole getting the results.
When ole is OUT I will come back to Man U, I agree with Roy Keane the Man U team is NOT OLEs level now
Virgil really babied Ronaldo at big OT and emptied the ground by half time.. he really is the GOAT
Oh dear 🤣🤣🤣 Please extend oli's Contract for another 10 years.
Well, after the last 5-6 matches, I felt this was bound to happen soon, at Atlanta we only survived
9 games not won two straight
I can't understand why people are worried about saying it's time to go, the guy had a team of world class players, tactically embarrassed game after game or get the best out of the top players, yet you want to give him time, how long exactly, a year, 2, 3, relegation?? Steve Bruce went just like that yet with the resources he had to cope with, yet Solskjaer has a team any manager would relish, gotta go and good riddance.
Brentford are a better coached football club.
Titsonanun fc😂😂😭😭
Ten Hag
Following a police man your a joke 🤣🤣🤣
Tonight Marks going to party like it's 1999!
Facts!
Who expected anything else from this game... bunch of clowns if you thought we were going to even be competitive against a team like liverpool
Bailey against West ham Man of the Mach why he stay bench
Ole out
Time to Riot. Ole has ruined Manchesrer United. Ole must leave.
What’s does Ronaldo offer us
I love ole but should never have got the first contract. Board constantly over pay for players we don’t use or need I.e. van de beek, sancho, telles. No way this is about Ronaldo and how only can’t find room for pogba to start is a joke. He just made a bad tackle, we were already 5-0 down
Banter FC. Arteta is clear 🤣
ole oute
Miss u sir,Alex. 😭😭
AWB, Slabhead and Bunter.....The Three Stooges. Liverpool were without key players as well.
Why are you SHOUTING?!?!
Tuchel didn't take a whole lot of time to turn the team around, not saying this just  because of champions league victory but in general he made Chelsea better tactically, ole needs to step down
well said - made perfect sense - wish you was on the board
Ole Out right fucking now !!!!
Ole and pogba must go and Ronaldo and Greenwood not enough starting lineup get bench front three is rashford , cavani , Sancho three midfield fred, van de Beek and Bruno
What does it mean give me five?
Give him more Time!!!!
Ole is a legend, i have defended him since he got the job now....but this was the last straw.......OLE OUT.....as much as it pains me to say it.....O L E O U T  !!
Ronaldo isn't a defender, and he WON'T help defend, Cavani does, the problem is the people infront of De Gea.  Ole is a Football Manager manager, start of the season, he make one tactic, and uses this tactic the whole season, and he auto pick the players, thats why McFred always plays.
My gran could manage this team better than Ole and she's dead! 😡
He couldn't lead a pack of ants to a picnic 😂😂😂😂😂
Enough is enough, Ole out……..but the owners won’t do it because the club want him in as it covers then.
I like Ole. He built us a brilliant squad and got us back on track to an extent but he won’t win us anything. I’m sorry Ole, but your time is up.
Yes Ronaldo overstepped the mark bud he showed he cares and showed his frustration. Too many on field we’re copping that beating.
Ole please resign 😩
Ole said he wants to stay, because “we’ve come too far”
The Glazers will sell more shirts now! United just lost their pants n shirts tonite!
Harry Maguire should resign as the captain. No leadership and no fight back. Sick of this guy who think he is world class.
Solskjaer was always a stop-gap coach and United need to put a stop to his reign. He is incapable of competing against the elite coaches for he is not an elite coach and never will be. Jurgen Klopp schooled the pupil.
Ole should resign if he loves united. It's very very clear that he should resign and vacant the position so that someone eligible can save united.
Maguire should follow ole
GET HIM OUT OF THIS CLUB
Liverpool are a good side and showed how much better they are than us as we are right now. We won’t win a trophy this year.
The idea that somebody should resign (ie admit defeat) as a sign of care is ridiculous. If the board and execs don’t have the balls to fire him, that’s on them. But it’s unfair to expect somebody to wave the white flag and justify it as “caring” for the club. If the board and execs don’t care, why should Ole?
Whoever is next Utd manager get him now so he would've time with this team & maybe he could do something in UCL or FA cup.
Let the fans own the club
The whole coaching management should be shak now
Ole doesn’t have the managerial talent for this level. He will never get it right.
At 73 I’ve been a supporter for well over 60 years and I’m absolutely gutted! Ole must resign!
Ole in
"Waterproof tea bag"
Mark is Taking Shots ☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️
Goldbridge is 100% right. I have always said Maguire is average and was at fault to most of the goals we conceded today. Ole love you but I want you out! Let’s bring in Rodgers!!!
Ole should have brought in a decent coach over the summer to help take him to next level, so only has himself to blame.
Are you Ole out yet !!! LOL
You should do a chart show on worst players
Utd fans were unbearable the first couple weeks of the season Grown men doing the Ronaldo and talking about the quadruple.  But we all knew Ole at the wheel we had nothing to worry about 😂
Same team with the same players (exlc Ron) as last season...where we held our own against Pool. What has happened this season? Pool have gone up a gear and we have regressed and/or the players are not playing for Ole any more...
Even if we beat city  This  doesn't change a thing We still lost 0-5 to liverpool
Ole out BRUCE IN
When Ryan Giggs gets out of jail give it to him 😂😂😂😂
Goldbridge in 😆
everything rickys been saying for a long long time about team shape is spot on will people finally start to realise it now
Ive zero sympathy the treatment of donny has been criminal. The favoirtism has been terrible. The signs were there last year. He gave his mates jobs. Shocking
Everyone out the way Ole's at the wheel aarrrgghhh!!💥💥
Ole is clueless and players need to book up
Get McFred OUT, OUT, OUT !!!
Ohh my god I seriously will pray all night long that the board will stick with OLE for 1more last gasp come back...he has been trained by Ferguson he will know how to come back hard ... please god let him be here next week don't let goldbridge get his discusting wish ..we are not CHEALSEA we don't want to start again and disturb everything built screw that
He never should've been given the job - that is on the board. But enough is enough now. There's been some great results but this is just shocking and his time's up. Fucking disgraceful and embarrassing..
Ole please stay!!!! We love you 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How can you have a player like Ronaldo who has achieved so much be subject to Maguire, the defender from Leicester ? How the hell is Maguire a captain in a team with Ronaldo? This proved to be Solskjaer's undoing. No wisdom. No guts.
You all deserve ole ole ole ole! Hahahaha
Ole must stay, Ole's at the wheel
Zidane in ole out
Couldnt lead a pack of ants to a pinic hahahaha m888
You United supporters have always favored a team of hyped individuals than a team of footballers. Enjoy this. You deserve all this pain. Hahaha
The owners are so inept they will back him.
Ole is the right man for the job, great comeback
United play like school Boys🖐.
Even under Dave Sexton , we were more exiting!
You've been mentioning the midfield for months, just no cover in front of Shaw today.  The players are too far away to tackle anyone, not enough energy in the players and not a compact team. Every single one of the Manchester United players not working as a team. Try using some of the reserves, at least they will run for 90 minutes.
😂
Let’s be honest, this guy will be here till the end of the season. We are finished.
Yet Ole said , "were nearly there" come on Ole have some dignity. Unbelievable.
Man city  and liverpool will win pl   They are very strong team🖐✅💯💙💖
Today’s result shows how far behind we are behind Chelsea, City and Liverpool!!!
McFred dnt work. That was our first line of defense. Liverpool danced around them.
You almost like Newcastle 😂😂😂😂🍾🍾🍾
It is a ABSOLUTELY appalling how BAD we have played today and even this season, it's like we're going to try and outdo ourselves every game to see how BADLY we can play and lose
Mark goldbridge Bless
Ole is not leading these players, need a serious manager in charge
Mclazynay can share a taxi out with the coaching staff
The media are as stupid as ole. This has been going on for over a year poor football. Its just being exposed to those who need it to be clear and obvious to understand whats going on.
Ole is making me think of Man Utd as a joke of a club.
These results were acceptable till last season as he didn't have a squad to challenge for the title. It's completely different now. They now have great players and it's justified that fans start asking questions when you aren't getting results.
I will even take Zidane,conte bt if we can get Ten hug then I will happily accept this lose
United problem is Ole It has been for over 4 years now.  He has WON NOTHING.  OLE OUT  End of story.
Mark you could be the manager
For those who couldnt attend the match. At half time they played Sweet Caroline in the stadium, a song that has become synonymous with Southgate and England. Lets hope thats NOT the club gauging the mood and hinting towards Southgate.
Shaw has pilled on a few pounds from last season. Hes been extremely poor
Funny how some fans need to get thrashed by our Rivals to realize Ole it ain't
"He couldn't lead a pack of ants to a picnic" even thou we rivals this guy is my favourite football Youtuber 🤣🤣
Hahahahah i love it.
Need beielsa or tenharg.not zidane plz
🔟 more yrs ✌
✋     Whisky nose 👺 coming out of retirement  # 👴
If only we had scholesy and g nev in charge.
Ole was the biggest thing from Norway since Aha 🎶 🎹 🎤 💿
Ole out
No proper manager actually respects Ole as another manager/coach. They know inside he is out of his depth. Ole out!
Brazy
I understand Arsenal’s in shambles but why United with all the super stars.🤷
We are not CHEALSEA we don't just sack our LEDGEN player/manager who will literally break his back for the club...to start again with a new foreign manager will just disturb everything OLE has been trained by elite coaches like Sir Alex Ferguson he will knows how to come back big time they must stick with OLE
Honestly, the fact he thinks Fred and Mctominay are better than Pogba, Matic, VDB is sackable without this result..
Give him time.....give him time.... remember 99' 😂🤣
Passion, trust and desire...pour homme by Ole.🤡😃
If the owners refuse to sack him, and he refuses to leave, we riot. I’m not joking. He cannot be allowed to stay at our club. Not after this. GET HIM OUT. NOW.
Siya ole and take mctominay with u
mark after Jose no trophy, i can only say that people  didn't like Jose, the fans, board, etc. Jose begged begged and didn't get players Ole got, believe me he would have won the title and more. Again be humble call him back. I know he said he wanted to stay at Roma, my analyze telling me that Jose has always love coaching in EPL but a lot of disappointment from Journalists, people don't want him more successful
Ole needs to be given a new extended contract. He is the manager that keeps on giving for opposing fans 🤪
Finally, you address the captain issue...how is Maguire man utd captain!!!!! He couldn't even defend Ronaldo!!! Bruno is my pick for that position!!
Samuel luckhurst and the MEN are now saying ole out that’s how shambolic it is
Solskjaer has just guided this team, worth over a billion, to a 5-0 loss vs our biggest rival. At home.   He’s the worst most incompetent manager we’ve ever had. And it isn’t a debate.
United won’t finish top 4
another mcfred show and defense clowns
Hello Man U and Spurs fans 😂😂
we are a business and a good mate fc   before a football club atm.
Finally you have broken … amen .. we all feel this pain
This is not the lowest...it has been low for the past two years
Who’s more deluded ole, or the pathetic fans?
The worst United performance I've seen. Ole and the coaching staff have to go
😂😂😂😂banter club
Gary  neville on sky was laughable 🤣
I swear to god Mark could to a better job that ole! It’s so dumb!
He will not be fired, but what Ole need to do is change to 4-3-3 and plant McFred far away from the first team.
Ole out
Somebody needs to teach maguire basic defending, paid 80m for a Sunday league defender
Players no heart, ole no mind. Dead...
Ole out! But first.. GLAZERS OUT!! They’re the reason we are in this mess
Ole needs more time
Liverpool fans singing Ole's at the wheel was the nail on the head.
You can apply for the manegerial role tbh.
Ole at the wheel how pathetic dose it feel
Ronaldo should've been red carded for kicking the damn ball into them man balls, shameful.
TAKE THE CAPTAIN BAND FROM HARRY!!!
Liverpool showed mercy after the red card passed it round for 30 minutes easily could have been 7/8-0
Has Ole resigned yet?
REMEMBER MIDDLESBOUROUGH
The owners don't want to win, only top 4, just like Arsenal.
Get Wenger as a care talker manager if we want to play attacking football and he most of the young player we have this what we have build  on not talk and do nothing... this was coming we could not win  europa cup.... wake up Solskjaer  and mike system is a joke
This united team with any good manager will be unstoppable.
Been saying it for a while now, Ole is clueless! Give Klopp or pep this team and the difference would be massive
Ole was a bench player and he was happy with that and that’s his mentality 💁🏻‍♂️ just happy to be there we need a winner and a leader
You should've been saying this long ago...hypocrite
United and their fans in the crapper at the old toilet 🤣 🤣🤣🤣
Ole was asked if he's having second thoughts about his ability to do the job and if he might resign. He says "we're too close now" 😂😂😂 You're miles away!! That comment alone is sackable
A manager is like a tv or movie director, you can have the award winning actors but if the setup is bad then there is no chance of success.
Banter club 😁😁😁
Ole on the wheel
This is totally embarrassing and is the lowest of lowest this team can get . A barrel of error and lack of game plan . Starting the same team again , Eric Bailey sitting on the bench with a team needing speed at the back , the wing backs tucking in to cover our two center backs , a team this talented getting beaten by 5 ,  game plan look like counter attacking but it all went wrong , Ronaldo looked like he was playing midfield , I saw ass well that they kept attacking Luke Shaw side in there attacks . No vision no recognition no idea of football tactics  , Ole has to go . Some changes are needed and immediate changes , enough is enough .
This is our Lampard. Thank you for your time. It's time to move on.
Ole the Wally😂 the truest words I ever heard
Full on Scholes told us what would happen if he started the game with that team and them tactics against a big team, what does ole do… puts the same team out and uses the same tactics
Ole need to realize he just not good enough. RESIGN TOMORROW Ole please
Not sure why he can't come to terms with that type of lost. It's something utd fans apart all saw coming from start of the season. Man utd still have not beaten anyone decent this season in the league. Gass utd fans start of season have finally seen their own stupidity for thinking u were ever going to challenge for the league this season!
Ole shoot himself in the foot this season he could simply picked donny and matic  He has to GO
Who do we appoint?
Enough is enough. Players just giving up halfway into the match.
I’m expecting a Club statement tonight not tomorrow tonight. Let’s save the season!
Ole's stubbornness is costing us dearly... Won't change the formation, won't start with best players, no style of play... We deserved to lose.
Love Ole..but his got to go now!!!
bro...how does Ole get a 6.8 after this performance??🤔 tf? HAS to be liverpool fans voting
Finally Mark
If we don't win a trophy 🏆 then we have so sack
So so many sheeps. lol
Ole 5 ever
This should have been the lineup ,degea baile lindolf Maguire, Shaw , dalot, mcfred Bruno rashford cavani , Ronaldo
Ole in Ole out shake it all about 😁
We love you Ole 💞 you have been good but I think it's time to go
Ole is the worse coach ..I've ever seen to let united gone crazy and mad to all the united fans in the history of the club.
Ole, please be honest. Do not try to protect your coaching staff, and yourself. You are not good enough, just admit it.
I don't wanna see ole in our next match to come, please!
I don’t blame the players on the pitch, the once that have passion is on the bench cuz of ole favouritism
We have an elite team with a amateur manager. Hes out of his depth
Give ole a new contract love it
Liverpool came to Old Trafford and took it over. Team ripped apart and every problem with the team highlighted. Complete and total humiliation
The problem is, most likely replacement is Conte who plays 3-5-2 with mcfred as his two mezzalas and Pogba as his regista. He will bench BRUNO.
not to gloat but i predicted this exact scenario to the Nth degree after the Leicester result. watch all the pundits blame Pogba and the players instead of their mate, pathetic how those biased lot are still in the job 🚮
Zidane and Ronnie
2:00
Man Utd are becoming the northern Arsenal
No clue what's next even if Ole is gone tmo who will restore the club to the point where they can consistently challenge or win. People who say they're surprised don't watch football because this has been coming even since last season
Ole out
Do the players have any responsibility? If Shaw would defend in his own territory and would stick to Salah, Pogba would control himself, and they would push against opponent, would run to get the ball, we still could lose but by playing football, what was-the players’ responsibility
Ole must GO!!
the ball was bouncing around too easy
Oles finished simple as that. Just watched sky sports and gary neville has officially lost credibility talking shite about players not running etc. Everyone can see the problem and its Ole. He's done a good job so far but that's it!!
Everyone blaming Mcfred but no one will notice our problems start with the strikers they are not helping so Mcfred gets overrun.
Maguire is so bad and I've always said this. I was amazed we signed this guy...3 years and we still have him at our club.
Definitely ole out
OLE OUT
Willenhall red says ' ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ' THIS MAN & HIS COACHES HAVE MADE OUR CLUB A LAUGHING STOCK  ' MCGUIRE ' FRED ' MCTOMMINAY ' LINDERLOF PACK YOUR BAGS AND YOU CAN LEAVE WITH OGS ' CARRICK ' MCKENNA & PHELAN '
Whole squad makes no sense. Pogba has to go! How many times has he not turned up for the team. The defence is a shambles. And Ole no clue as to who to play up front or any idea of basic tactics.
Liverpool fans singing "Ole at the wheel" at the end of the match sums it up.
We all love our club but this is now rock bottom a complete rebuild is needed asap. Well done to Liverpool
Remember when ole “steadied the ship?” 😂
Rashford should have played today. Ole just needs time. 😂😂🤦‍♂️
I love oli give him a life time contract. TACTICALLY INEPT. CTID.
as if Liveroppol sabotaged the player ratings xD
I'm sad because I really wanted ole to do well. It's not worked clear out the coaching staff and we have to thank ole for trying...just not up to the job and it started so well
Apart from Ole Topics, Bruno still disappeared in big matches...He is good player but not the world class ...
I think the return of fans is a problem at united. I've said for years our players struggle with the pressure of playing for man United. Without fans that was reduced and we do better, finish 2nd last year. I think it's a real problem
Enough is enough ole out
roy keane  must be come an interim   manager
what a prat marky mark.. so long suck in neutral ground. now you want ole out? shadap
I do not want to give Ole more time, but I do think that the owners should take whatever time they need to get the best replacement. Panicking would simply make things worse.
The players are also to blame . They are awful.  The so called superstars went missing again
Well we Ole outers been telling you Ole in clowns all season this wouldn't end well. Hope you're happy now.
Lampard  was a good player for Chelsea  he got fired  y not ole' sorry to say it I love ole' as a player
The game was all my worst fears came true. Our come-back victories covered up the flaws and made the criticism go away for a while. I love Ole but I am not seeing any foundational improvements on the pitch, in tactics, mentality, or anything really. Players are given too much freedom to screw around to their liking becoz it seems .... .... ! too depressed to write.  i can throw a lot of reasons here but in all honesty, I think I now understand what Arsenal fans felt like after the 8-2 game!   now gonna get myself ready emotionally for man city game!
The saddest thing about this is that we have very GOOD DAMN PLAYERS!
*Ole should stay though. We were destined to lose today. Liverpool is a top tier team like Chelsea & Man City*
Klopp makes changes to a brilliant team to hold against our counter attack. What did Ole do ? He plays the exact same team we almost got 4-0 to an Atalanta team. How is that a manager for united let alone any team.
Ollie do the right thing and resign.
VDB or Ole to go first? Sidebets anyone?
Gareth southgate would do a better job without  doubt and his not good enough, so what does that say about Ole
OLE IN. Trust the process. Give him time.
United legends are ruining the club casting their massive shadows over the current team. Schmeichel saying ole is the only manager for your club and a big manager wont work. Roy keane would have been calling for the head of any other manager but not if it's his former teammate. So glad my clubs ex players can keep their fucking mouths shut and enjoy watching.
The united stand‼️ 1.17million losers lol✌️
What’s this guys obsession with the owners, they have invested heavily..  im sure this div was the one begging for Sancho and before that Maguire..
cld have been 9-0 today and Ole wld go immed! Great Klopp vision/move to tone it down in 2nd half cos keeping Ole in this job means keeping out a title contender.
Ole must go he has no clue wtf is even going out I have been a supporter for 28 years now and I have never seen Liverpool batter us in my lifetime the coaching is completely dead no clue how to even play football and they call themselves ex footballers
Cardiff II. Never say never
We lost 4-1 at home under alex Ferguson, to Liverpool, in2009
Saw nigel de Jong saying maguire the most over rated defender in the league. Finally I have bn saying it for months.
Pre warning signs were there against wolves n Newcastle. Now we are up against the very team in England or perhaps Europe and there's hasn't been any changes since then. Ole has done a fantastic job but I doubt he's the right man to take united to another level. Ole has to go
I so agree with you I wish I seen this live haha
Ole could not manage a piss up in a brewery
Mark almost ALL of the goals are coming down luke shaws side! Jose was right about him. Go back and check most goals conceded and you will see luke shaw is culpable for nearly all of them
If I was the manager: De Gea, Dest, Varane, kounde, Shaw, Mejbri, Tchouaméni, Bruno, Sancho, Ronaldo, Amad.
The problem z ole flavored some players..i feel sorry for donny
The saddest thing about today's result is that there is nothing surprising about it. Any decent team can thrash us like this.
Also give it a rest. You’re part of the problem
People & board jumping up and down with the occasional comebacks hopefully now gets the real picture...we've been conceding goals for so long...no one was worried. Midfield is where the buildup happens and with mcfred it's a blackhole... Greenwood good player...but needs a slap on the head...and lastly...Harry Maguire...best play kids & they will do a better job
Proper leadership Steve Bruce a kabab and a plate cheesy chips should get it done
Koeman vs Ole. Epic battle
Can someone please explain to me how the "title challengers" are on the same points as "relegation contenders"? 😁 Siiuuuu 😁😁😁
Today we are shattered. If you play well and still lose that can be a consolation. But if you have some of the most talented players in the world and yet play such a disorganized game, that is ridiculous. We had no organization, no system, and no plan against Liverpool. Lets face it. The club is too big for Ole. We need an experienced, world-class manager. United deserve nothing less.
Player ratings insanely hilarious :D :D
Embarrassing. OLE OUT!!!
Gary Neville must stop backing Olly.
Neville rhetorical non sense
i can't believe i'm experiencing this with you right now mark
Yes mark have a hart man give him time Ollie at the wheel
I told you so!
One bad result isn’t the end of the world, Ole is the future!I. In Ole we trust!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ole deserves a chance to build this team. Ole's at the wheel 🤗
Did no-one seriously question why Harry Maguire walked into the captaincy when he joined from Leicester having never been a captain of a team in his life and showing zero leadership qualities
%100 👍
Last week: “I’m not going to be  ole in or ole out” Today: GET OUT😂
Give it keano
Mark I can't believe ur pushing for OLES head I hope the club won't do what you want them to do..I'm %95 sure you will get ur wish tonight...but god willing please god the club will give him a chance again to come back plz god
him and his back ground team is about as helpful as a chocolate fireguard
Keep ole at the wheel PLZ
We aint even get a man of the match🤣😭
I'd take Steve Bruce over Ole right now. No other Premiership club and 99% of the Championship wouldn't touch Ole. You have to go down to Rooney & Derby at the bottom of the championship to find someone less suited to football management than Ole.
Ole Out (666×666)
Sancho, Van De Beek, Pogba & Bailly on the Bench!? Shocking!!!
Let’s not forget, in the time ole has been here he’s won absolutely NOTHINNG. Why would we give him more time? There literally is no point! I’m absolutely gutted
Ole out and also Karim benzema deserves Ballon d or.
Please don't sack him!
The players gave up because they know Ole is not the man. Even Pogba didn’t want to play by getting himself sent off
Sack ole and bring Zidane in? Who said Zidane would even want to coach us
A few days ago Woodwartd said he had confidence in the manager winning trophies,but how Mr Woodward?.Ole is tactically the worst manager in the league so what's this special formula Mr Woodward that you nare the only person on earth knows about?.Don't be a coward,answer my question on here.
Ole out
I become a manager of Manchester united
We go again 🤮
😂😂😂
Ole is not going nowhere , he needs time last season he did very well   lets be patient ..even klop started bad and had to build his squad
Found out by the big boys eventually!
Expected a defeat going by how disjointed United are and Liverpool back in the form that won them the league title though it turned out a lot worse than expected.  Regardless of manager, the players should be able to lift themselves against a big rival at home. Instead those players allowed Liverpool stroll to one of their easiest ever wins in this fixture. Liverpool to their credit are one of the top sides in Europe but how hard did they have to work for any of their 5 goals today?  The under 12 like defending from Shaw and Maguire in the opening quarter set the tone for a shambles of a performance.
Van Dijk had every right to give that petulant tw@ a piece of his mind and more after what he did to Jones...lucky to only have one sent off as you rightly say, and the least you can do is thank us for being the side that puts your manager out of his misery...again!
The player's are not playing for ole he's got go asp
But Ollie is a nice guy! He’s tried his hardest! from your northern friends 😉⚫️⚪️ Ollie out!
this is that i'm waiting for! he must be OUT NOW!
Ole needs to go ASAP if ole don’t go now we will be worst next season he won’t win any trophies and pogba is going to leave, along with vdb, matic is old and Maguire is still are captain. Enough is enough
OLE out and get Steve Bruce in
Ole out time is up
And am actually not too surprised.... if Leicester city can win 4-2 and we coming behind to win Atlanta.
Hit the bars and protest tonight
He's got go by tomorrow
Ole’s interview after the match, delusional! Sorry ole you have fixed so much but you have to resign.
Worst performance I've ever seen, Shaw and Maguire are responsible for almost all the goals we've conceded this season
I have no sympathy for someone that has dug their own grave.
'As useful as tits on a nun'😅 this guy
Ole started this massive game with 200 million pounds of talent on the bench in vdbeek pogba sancho because he doesn't know how to use them and picks mcfred.  OLE OUT let's get a good manager now .
There were only two players with any fight in them, Ronaldo and De Gea. The rest of the team is an absolute disgrace.
let’s all laugh at Man U 😝😂
Give Ole another chance
i love ole as a player but as a manager its enough
United are a sinking ship. It's a sad reality. United are now just a shirt selling club with no ambition to win anything significant.
Utd are finished as a top club...just accept it. We are second tier.. Welcome to the land of Everton,Villa,Arsenal. Finished.
Ole needs to take Maguire Mctominay and Fred and leave.
Pogba # 💯 mill ⬇ the 🚽 😂
Not even joking, Jose Mourinho’s Paddy Power advert just interrupted the video…🌚
Finally Mark's officially Ole out...good on you mate.
Remember if you may, that Woodward COULD HAVE hired Pep, Klopp and so so many other top class managers over the last few years!!
Ole is shockingly stubborn and horrible tactically. Off you go
Jadon Sancho couldn't get in City's team, so spat his dummy out and went to Germany. Comes back to Manchester just to spite City, and can't get in the team 🤣🤣🤣 We couldn't buy this kind of entertainment. To think City got a percentage too 💙
Ole has made me realise the importance of a good manager
# Ole @ the 🎡 😂 😂 😉
The signs that Ole is not the right manager for this team have been there from the beginning, but we all chose to ignore them !!
“This game will echo for all eternity”
It is clear that ole is a mediocre, and have seen this since last year final against Villarreal... He needs to be sacks. A mediocre can not leads this team to any glory!
Ten hag plz.....I want to see a real manager
I love Ole and respect him as a player, but as a Manger he has taken us to a better level than before; but I don't think he has what it takes to take us to the next level. also, he's stubborn as a mule and won't use Van de Beek, even though he's better than Fred and McTominay. I am not sure if we can win anything under Ole! He's a human being and I am saying this with a heavy heart, but he's got to go!
Ole just said he isnt leaving.
Gary Neville where you at !!!!
That's what ole get for refusing to play donny
Bring Moyes 🔙 😁
Couldnt Lead a pack off ants to a fucking picknik 😂😂😂
Why Fred ? Why greenwood?
Ole is the biggest thing from Norway since Aha.  🎶   🎹   🎤   🎼   🎵  #  He is the one   ------
Exactly how scholes said it would happen... that's how it went down tonight.. we got destroyed in the first half..
Keep Ole! He will take you to the promised land
About time people agree Ole should be out. Been saying it for a year and a bit now. Anyone with a right mind could see that he’s under qualified, under experienced, and simply incompetent to manage a club like man utd
Ole knows how bad this is. He should now go to 4-1-3-2 against Spurs, beat them, don't be happy and carry on a winning run. Donny should now play alongside Bruno and Sancho. Time's up for Fred, Pogba, McTominay...
This was coming but everyone were hopeful for a miracle and another issue which can be thought of is our club is into a cycle we hire a new manager he brings some positivity and 2nd or 3rd year he is gone again we are at the start of the cycle. The club needs a reshape right from the base
Fifteen minutes in and Mark is doing his usual McFred stuff. I'm hoping to God he realizes it's also the likes of Rashford too.
Waiting for united PR people to post tweets- this one, sorry you cannot spin this and dont even try
There's absolutely no discipline in this team...all of the Liverpool goals were preventable...
Ole should stay and players love walking instead of pressing appalling
🔟 more yrs for Ole 😝
About time Goldbridge got on the common sense/Ole out train
Hope the management uses the female team for the remaining games
Ronaldo losing 5-0 to his team’s biggest rivals is nothing new.
I can’t understand how Maguire is are captain, he has made plenty of errors this season and he is the most expensive fridge in the world, Just because he played good for England and he’s English he hardly gets criticism, apart from his heading ability he is a basic defender and ole has to go!
Thank You Mark… OLEOUT!!
That actually did happen, Mark 😂 Barca - RM 5-0
# 📴 the perch 🐔 😂
It is so nice to see Man Utd supporters ranting and winging about their manager and their superstars disgraceful performance. Who decided that Man Utd have the right to be champions without working hard for it. The biggest problem for me is that you have too many so called superstars and not enough desire and work rate. The wingbacks need to track back and help out the two guys in midfield. The Liverpool players pressured  and chased every tine that they lost the ball. Getting rid of the manager will not fix the problem overnight.
Zidan or Kante are not the answer, we need a “building team coach”, like Klopp, Pep, Tuchol, Flic … Zidan comes to just win with a set team, this team is just individuals
Ole in........
I would resign ..I managed at under  8 levels and I would go goodbye
Manchester Really needs Zidane only he is the who one can save Manchester United to recover the points
Shaw only looks good going forward but dull defensively
This is not Manchester United quality play … no heart at all get rid of them all
How did Liverpool not score against 10 men, terrible.
Paul Scholes was right.
Ole u are still legend but u need to out
if man united wants a quick success let them bring conte instead of Zidane, for me i want Conte a head of zidane.
Paul scholes said chelsea has the worst defence in top 4. let that sink in!
Paul Scholes got it right, and said if he plays the formation like Wednesday match Liverpool could be up 3.0 by half time, Ole is not a title winner manager
Get suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii and ole out of my club now!
relegation form. theres nothing else to do but sack
Embarrassing
Protest tonight
Not about players
Still love the player, has reached his ceiling as a manager. Zidane would revitalized squad as we have a good contingency of French players but we also could use Contes prowess criticizing of the owners, who let’s face it, should be the most at blame.
As useless as tits on a nun😂😂
I 100% agree Ole should walk because these mugs are not going to sack him that today was the final straw I know we recently been papering over cracks but to lose like that today was when for me it’s all done Please as a united Legend walk and don’t let us remember you as the manager that REALLY fecked it go when you still have some sort of credibility and I agree also this squad is not this bad.
Why would you sign sancho and van da beek when u dont have a  specialist cdm, sackable offence right there.....
🚫OLE OUT🚫
OLE IN!!! Please keep him! 😂
Would rather watch a Tahitian club than Utd with Solskjaer
The death of the Theater of Dreams
Nevilles lost it
The reality is he has no brain in coaching……
Why can’t we bring back garner and laird from loan they deserve a chance
Jaysus,hes ole out.bout time
Arteta in
Shitty match, ole out better.. Salah was free moving all match. No basic plans
If Mr Solskjaer has any love left for the club, he should just resign
Give him time he will turn it around
The idea of a manager is to create a machine , a system of play where by even if one or two players are missing , the system , the experience and trust you have on the pitch will see you through most challenges .That is what Liverpool have with Klopp and what we used to have with Sir Alex . Ole had been at the club for two and a half years and there is no trust whatsoever, no relationship can work without trust he has to go .
When I saw McFred in the lineup, I knew we were finished.
It’s like a Lamborghini with a bus driver 🔥🚗
Its stupid to fire Ole alone, he is the manager not the coach, we need defense, attack, set piece coaches and game analyzer, then comes to the manager, all of them must be changed which is a difficult task, and that Italian manager is not the answer
This is jst hilarious now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lads we don’t zidane we need allah this team is done
Keep trusting on improvements made by ole even it would take 100years..Ole is at the wheel!
I would resign at 7 pm
Ole ruined Donny's career. Now Karma will ruin his managerial career ( I mean, as if he had one)
hey it was just a game there no need to get depress😂😂
It  is  the  players  fault
Ole can do one last good thing for United and take his Captain with him where ever he is going. Bailly is clear
Maybe Man U will score against Spurs, Ole..... the best thing since sliced bread
Ole out of course but seriously...Maguire might be the worst and dumbest player ever, and he's also the captain of the english selection?! English people are weird!
Mourinho lost 5-0 to Barcelona and the year after was Champion of Spain. But very different times, very different teams, very different managers
Bro you’ve been on the Ole bandwagon for practically the whole time until the last few months. I was Ole out the first season when they didn’t finish top 4.  He was a caretaker and that’s all
Gotta be honest the Liverpool fans singing ole at the wheel had me in stitches
I wasted my entire evening n 200 bucks on beer n snacks thought being a neutral I would enjoy this game but guess what after 35 mins of the game it was not even watchable
Ole is destroying his legacy, by staying on
Team was bad, but Shaw was terrible, all goals came from him, and off course ended up making the team down, he always was in the mid line and entire Salah side was way open, he was terrible on all goals
Manchester UFC
Greenwood is Ole's son or what ? Chance after chance after chance... We  started the match with  10 men...
Not sure any manager is ready to take this project on after this shitshow we saw today.  There are levels... but there is the basement as well.
Get Steve Bruce in!
The real rating for Ole was minus one
Ole only cares about keeping his job and getting his paycheck 😭😭
Ole in. We are playing the 'Utd way'. Don't listen to the plastic fans. We are getting close.
How dose maguire get in the england team shite
Well Paul, call it.
just listen to ole interview and gary neville on sky sports. those guys are delusional
He is too ignorant to resign 😒
Ole has never been the manager... It's Phelan all this while.. Ole is just the spokeperson in front of the camera... The club is a circus...
Ole can finally put a stop to his SMILE!!! But I will still love him as a player!!!
Mark finally said ole out
They all have to go
Ole to remain forever, Ole is a better scholar of football than Pep
Swindon Town: "We don't want Maguire"
Ole out
We all love you Ole but enough is enough now.
I’ve never seen quality players look so poor with this coaching staff- if I was solskaer I’d apologise and retire
Why is Van de beek not playing
Ole in
Ole is done now, the only way I see a change now is to change the manager, nothing else can be done to recover this season, stood by Ole all the way but today was the final nail, love Ole and respect what he's done but we've hit the ceiling and bounced back to the bottom.
Luke shaw with one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Watch the goals again, hes at direct fault for 4 out of 5
Big sam would do a better job
This club is being managed by 4 BTEC, BTEC, P.E teachers.
Remember when arsenal fans were reactionary after losing 5-0 to city and he mocked fans for saying Arteta out? Joke man
Ole must go back to Norway, Ole needs healing for his mind.
1:00 finally had to be said Mark. Not good enough. Always be a club legend but ole out.
Ronaldwho?
Ronaldwho?
Ole Gunnar should go out on loan in January 😂
What a way to set up OLE...  I feel like getting getting Zidane is not the answer.. conte will solve everything
OLE IN
If u gave Mourinho this squad he would win trophy
One good reason why Ole should be here on the next match?  E M B A R R A S S I N G.
is here for the entertainment of the inbreds fuming
I thought we will lose, but I wasn't expecting to be absolutely annihilated
Ole has made Man U into a school boy team the team is in scrambles, Ole has to swollow his pride and resign now to stop the bleeding, Ole pls we are begging you if you love this club and the fans as much as you say you do pls resign and stop the bleeding now and give a proper manager a chance to bring this team back to the top, we need Conte or Zidane right now, Glazers open your eyes Ole is not the man for this job wake up Glazers wake up
Ole is a pompous arrogant know it all, fans think he's a nice bloke, nah he cant see beyond himself.
Sloppy sloppy defense
Get out Ole gunner solskjaer👎👎👎👎
Man United enjoyed the glory days during the Ferguson era. Now it will be like this for a long long time
Absolutely shite worst utd team i have ever seen
Ole's giggling, smiling and sticking his tongue out after the Everton game has finally caught up with him lol Didn't see him smile once today. He's done.
It was more than 5 l jxt said it from the beginning if OLE is the couch it is bullshit
Solskjaer tried but in the end his limitations have been laid out for all to see and him & the coaches have not learned from ongoing issues and mistakes.
Why didnt the club strengthen the holding midfielders during the summer instead if buying sancho or ronaldo
😂😂
Ole needs to resign……Conte is available he’s won Trophies with Juventus,Chelsea and Inter Milan
Not at the match no?
bruce in
For the first time I'm struggling to defend OLE I'm so sad to see him go down like this.... please plz god willing give him few more games to come back plz don't sack him yet
Can we protest now?? Thanks.
CR is like playing with 10 men.  Just cares about his goals … not a team player.  There’s your problem.
Harry Maguire is toilet
You’re absolutely Ole out
ole:OUT Captain Armband:CR7 United:Title challengers   SIMPLE a Year ago you said give him more time😤Get out
Ole's under the wheel
Ole, Pogba, Fred, Mctominay, Maguire  OUT
P pogba was our man of the match coz he took out the man who did all this
Man United need to drop Ronaldo , Degea , Fred,
Is it only Ole’s problem ?
Ole out
LMAO
This is what happens when Alex Ferguson still has leverage at Old Trafford. Fergie stated that they had their club back with Ole's appointment. Well, you're welcome to it, Fergie old bean.
Are Newcastle be the new United? Are Man U the new Newcastle?
United desperately need a CDM
I remember when Mourinho was fired before Christmas when we were 6th in the table after losing to Liverpool.
We need to be ruthless with everybody. Sack Ole now and get Ten Hag and Van Der Sar with offers they can't refuse. Screw ethics. Screw Ajax. Screw Ole. Screw everybody.
Sit Maguire and play Eric, he's got passion for the club
So much promise at the beginning of the season  Now this!!!!!!!
Ole just said that the coaches are brilliant and that the fans who stayed are the only true fans🤣🤣
Please ole don't go. Help relegate ManU
OLE OUT !!!!!!!! IVE CHANGED MY MIND NOW HE HAS TO GO!!!
My Egyptian king ❤️🇪🇬👑
You're absolutely right man❤️
Ole IN
Oh great Goldbridge is Ole out (effectively). Interesting what it takes to recognise incompetence. Sentiment over being rational.
This was a bad Liverpool today.
Needs more time
Oles at the wheel
Ole the Wally had a match rating of -300000 odd at on point on the ratings. About the only accurate rating on the sight this year. Pogba lazy, useless and pathetic, deliberate red card so he doesn't have to get shown up against city. Ole out ffs, he is ruining our club on par with the Glaziers.
Zidane
No top 4 this season ole is out of his deepth
Please give Ole a life contract😂
Atleast we didn't concede from a set-piece. That is progress for you.
The match was up as soon as mc fred was on the list
The trolls ending up giving Ole a 6.8🤣🤣 okay. Fair play. Tits On A Nun FC needs a new manager. Absolute shambles.
🤣🤣🤣
I’m loving this😂😂😂
Play defencive is the best
Give Ole Time.
OLE OUT!😭😭😭
lol 😂😂😂
Aside from everything else, this game proves how much of a biased joke it was for Ronaldo to get POTM over Salah… I’ll say it with my chest, Ronaldo only scores Andy Carroll headers and Adriano power smashes, he’s not on Salah’s level
Protest against being losers again 😂😂😂
Salah sent Ole to the Shadow Realm
Ole out
this is the lowest i have seen united in my life time, united need to get rid of ole in the next 24hrs
Ole out
ZIDANE needs the call in the morning.
OLE IN, GGMU
Man utd spent 125 mn and still play trash🤣
It's sickening how we got easily torn apart the coaching is horrific ole just resign!!!
BRO YOU'RE RIGHT. LIVERPOOL WILL SINK CITY.
First yessssssssssss
"Water proof tea bags" =D
This manager should not leave the ground with a job. Send him straight back to Norway directly from OT
Ole got a -600000.0 when I did the player ratings 😭💀💀
Ole out
Ole in
Ole with his square wheel bus
U DIDNT SUBMIT VOTE
