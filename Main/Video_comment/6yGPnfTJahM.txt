素晴らしいクリスマスディナーに招待してくれてありがとう。 中村俊輔と古橋の絵から動画が始まり、スコットランドの冬山から春の富士山に変わって感動しました。 ポステコグルー監督、ジョタ、古橋、ハートも、みんなかわいい！🥰  Thank you for inviting me to a wonderful Christmas dinner. The video started with a picture of Shunsuke Nakamura and Furuhashi, and I was impressed by the change from winter mountains in Scotland to Mt. Fuji in spring. Postecoglou, Jota, Furuhashi, and Hart are all cute!
Big Barkas Dropping the Gravy on the way in!
Absolutely loved it Jota as George Michael 🤣🍀🍀🎄🎅🏻

Merry Christmas from Australia my scottish Celtic Brethrens
Ange writing a letter to jota, Jota looking happy to get it, they’re definitely teasing jota to celtic permanently
Another gulp in the throat at the end ,wee Bertie 🍀🍀
Oh aye great Christmas song🙄. Lol
Funniest, unexpected thing I have ever seen. Enjoyed every second of it here in Australia.
I’m tearing up here
@ 11.15am 23/11/21 the 16k views is just me 😉
Now it’s Christmas 🎄🍀 All the best to everyone 💚
I love you Celtic football club ☘️🤣💜
This one tugged on the heart string a wee bit lol, rip Bertie💚🍀
John Lewis could never even dream of this perfection
Mate is Tom Rogic camera shy or something he is never in any vids, it would be so cool to see him in something and funny at the same time
Merry Xmas to all you hoops out there 🎄 Santa’s a TIM
I hate to bring down the mood ladies and gentlemen, but I’ve read some potentially horrendous news this morning. Scott Bain is rumoured to be in line for a new long-term deal. What?   First we give Greg Taylor a new long-term deal, on bigger wages. Now we’re giving one to Scott Bain as well? Seeing as we’re now just a charity handing out massive wages to deadwood players, can I have a big new contract too whilst we’re at it?   No wonder we’re so far behind the likes of Ajax, Leverkusen, Porto etc etc when we’re just throwing away our resources on utter dross.
There's nothing as Camp as Christmas! Happy Knew Year! 💥
Brilliant!
Celtic isn’t just a club. It’s a way of life YNWA 🍀💚
Love it were Glasgow Celtic 🍀🍀💚🤍💚🤍🍀🍀
😭😭😭💚 I've never been happier 😭😂💚
That ending 💀
Put a smile on everyone’s face in my home far from Scotland. Merry Christmas and thank you for such a lovely Christmas gift.
