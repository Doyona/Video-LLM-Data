DOWNLOAD THE CHRISTMAS SINGLE HERE: https://bit.ly/38lO2d5  I hate to bang on about it, but I’m not sure i’ll ever be able to knock together a song as good as this ever again, so I’d hate to miss the opportunity to do something good in an otherwise pretty grim year. Again, any profits made from streams/downloads this month I’ll be donating to Stroke Association, which really is a great cause. So if you’ve a spare 59p to download the track it would mean the world to me.  Thanks for an out of schedule Monday night upload. I hope you enjoy it. Yes, eating like this two days in a row is a bad idea. Yes, I’m going to gain weight this month. Yes, I’ll lose sight of my abs. No, it’s not the end of the world…it’s Christmas after all! I hope you’re having as merry a season as possible in present circumstances and I’d be over the moon to see you again for the next video! :)
how the fuck is singing about garlic bread a Christmas song
just eating 1 dbl big mac is like eating a cement block don't know how you do it😂
THE GODFATHER III REFERENCEE?????? HELL YEAH!!!
Awe look at us eating big Macs together still four years later 😂 they need to bring back the double Mac asap ! And always get extra sauce**
Why not Big Tasty? Thats the best burger.
I really really really adore your clips! Been watching them from the start and pretty hooked ;-) Yesterday almost 5h straight! Greetz from Belgium! Cheers, Th.
Want to see u do sushi
Id love to own and play that all day ur street fighter 2 arcade machine
Street fighter 2! In germany we say geil!! 👍
Drago. Is that a Rocky reference?  P.S. I love the cold ‘zza fan club poster/canvase.
My buddy loved Big Macs. He would drown each one with 8 ketchup packets. It was a bloody mess.
I appreciate how Mrs. Beard just drops them.   Lets us know how heavy they are.
Whoa. Has Street Fighter II always been there?!
A Big Mac is already two patties so these ones have four? It’s just a Big Mac, dude.
way to double down!!!
Imagine if he was a diabetic and had a low blood sugar, He would be unstoppable
It doesn’t count if you eat the food at home
You got a microwave? 'Weard'!
THE MOST MCDONALD'S DOUBLE BIG MACS EVER EATEN | XMAS SERIES 2020 |             BeardMeatsFood love louis shirley
Whheeeeuuuuuu ski doo! Must be a phrase you guys say before you eat in England? We say whhhheeeeuuu sea doo in the USA cause we like jet skis better than snowmobiles
4:25 You should take freezer shopping bags in the car to keep your food hot…! (Yes they work both ways!)  Also you could turn oven on before you go and pick it up - keep it around 100 % and then you can enjoy food hot rather than always eating cold food when not everything is good once cold..! At least for these “at home” videos..
This should be another one to give another go since they changed to their new (awful) brioche style buns which are actually quite tough to bite through.
It’s the street fighter arcade game for me
Hey @beard can you do a BK Double Wopper challenge like this for Xmas2024?😜 I would love to see that, and wish I could do that like you. I know that would be way more difficult but I think nicer to eat qua flavour.
Third time watching you magnificent mongrul, or is it mogul?
The thing that throws me off here, is most of the time he looks like he enjoys the meal. Not here. Thanks for suffering for your crazy craft, mate.
MUST be about time to do this again, you´ve developed A LOT since this
I wanna see you eat a ton of hot peppers Adam, now that’s a challenge!  It props bro that’s a lot of processed food to eat hopefully you don’t get sick or a disease…I didn’t wanna say the C word and jinx ya.
2:30 Beard mentions that he's a world Poontang champ.. He done left Mrs. Beard for younger, prettier Poon.. Now he's getting it on in his 'Beard Meats Tang' videos..
The 12 Max of Christmas...
Granted I've never eaten nearly that many.... BUT i've never experienced the "dryness" you speak of.  The Big Mac sauce should take care of any of that!
Husker Du!!!
Who gets a plain BigMac? Need cheese!
Making anyone laugh while doing a food challenge is sadistic😮
hmmm
That’s the worst most annoying song I’ve ever heard. Can’t even call that music
Try that today. You won't be able to Afford them this year
That song doesn't hit no more.
Hahaha burger boy
Need some extra mac sauce to lubricate them sandy's 😂  EDIT: you came to that realization now in the video lol awesome garlic bread song by the way I've added it to my Christmas Playlist 😅👊🏼🍻
Joey < Beard
I had 2 big mac and fries once, i felt dirty afterwards, had tummy gurgles and a sloppy you know what.  What happens after 20 of these wretched things. Its not even food as i understand the definition. Gross
I’m going to be singing the garlic song in the middle of the night for decades. Thanks. It’s really cute, and well done.
Not even close there lad, Geoff Esper did 38 Big Macs in under an hour.
Wow! 4M subs. You earned every one of them. Well-played, Mr. Moran.
That's not true cause 30 big macs is different then 15 double cause all they did is put the double meat on on it so you didn't have to eat the amount of bread he did that cheating.. you only ate more meat he ate more bread..  who ate more
Apprenty this is only a UK thing cause they never did this in America... and they say America is fat.... just saying....
I have only read the title and I'm already on the toilet dropping an empathy deuce.    I don't favor mandates but I hope you maintained proper social distancing after that as a common courtesy
Ruff
Mr. Beard, I’ve seen you eat and win every type of eating contest imaginable, and you are a ferocious eater. I know you ate 12 double Big Macs, which is incredible, but I worked with a detective in our Fugitive Unit that consumed 39 Big Macs, a large chocolate shake and 2 orders of large fries. He weighs a biscuit over 290lbs. I’d  put him up against anyone in an eating contest, even you. Keep up the great videos!!!
Gaaarlic bread 🎶
Sorry newer to your channel. What exactly are you yelling before you eat?
Thumbs up for the Parp! 🤣👍
At 33 minutes he looks like the people who constantly vacate the premises of a McDonald’s
is that a smokes poutinerie shirt in the back? From the contest eh?
Disgusting.
You're beating Michael Buble on the charts priceless 😊
U will have a great Santa beard when it finally turns grey
McRonchies, is the candie of burgers 🍔
Mrs Beard has no sympathy.... LOL 😂
I got 5 down and was miserable all day... Heavy sauce is a must.😅
Who says dolphins are smarter than humans?
The only people saying that dolphins are close to as smart, as smart or smarter than humans are humans dumber than dolphins.
You did good beard absolutely amazing  lindsey you are a funny chick l love you xxxxxxxxxxx
I like watching some of your challenges. I don't know where you put it all lol. McDonald's is really bad, human flesh childrens body parts found in the meat. They have been mocking us for years putting human flesh in our foods and laughing at us eating it. Also remember a while ago when the so called mad cow disease about. It wasn't that at all it was kuru disease from eating contaminated human flesh.  Also the horse meat scare years ago that was also human meat. I have now become vegetarian can't eat meat anymore but I still enjoy your challenges. You seem like such a nice soul you have a nice energy about x
Where’s the stomach pump?
Why do those look huge the big mac patties are small in canada they dont even cover the bun
dude lay of sugar you are about to explode. you have your own area code
Cashless society, social credit score, absolute control all in the name of “convenience”.
Your a brave lad Adam McDumpies patties are as dry as saw dust and have the same texture as well😂
Its always nice to see mrs beard and the banter is always fun to watch
What's the aftermath like man? Do you force yourself to spew or just let your body naturally get rid of all the food over a few days? Surely you must have to employ a sennoside or something to help move such a huge amount of food?
you have to eat the rabbit food, sadness
how much sodium was that?
I hate that McDonalds switched to shredded lettuce.
Why does American fast food have to be such shit! These look way better than the Big Macs I get.
May god have mercy on your toilet
Way to  go  Beard
you complain about everything then say you only have a couple things you hate.
The list of colors, perservatives, emulsifiers, thickeners in Macdonalds sauces, cheese, bread buns is insane. As much as I like watching BeardMeatsFood, I'd rather you not risk your health doing some of these challenges.
How many did yoi buy
More than 2 of those sounds horrendous... Lol i like to take out the middle bun and replace it with fresh cooked chips.
How old is this mans wife? She looks like 15-20 years older than him. I thought that lady was his Aunt or something this whole time!
If I got really stoned i’d probably be able to eat 6 big macs but 12 double big macs is insane
bruh badlands chugs at the beginning caught me so off guard had to check if I was on the right channel
I would have taken extra sauce to hide the taste of the meat, the meat on McDonald's doesn't taste good 🤣
The timer changed when you went to get towel.  Don't be cheating lol. Just kidding your the master.
I would like to see a challenge of done without water use as this looks way to easy with the use of fluid
0:39 What an appropriate line for this moment.
It's the extra additives they put in the burger...
I find american mcdonalds birges vety salty
06:01 🤣
weak
Bid ma s are probably the most popular fast food burger in existence.  Theyre tasty, saucy (which helps w swallowing, and just delicious. So good luck
I’ve never even heard of a double Big Mac
I've never seen a double big mac here in the US, I'm almost jealous.  I like the big mac taste but frankly I'd rather have a whopper instead.
Bad What What?
I bet a guy to eat 8 big macs before. He was so confident. Uk if it makes any difference in burger sizing.🤷 He was a big eater, hence the confidence, but he massively underestimated the power of the Mac. He was done on his 3rd.  Free big macs for everyone else that lunch time. On him.
If they do to him what they do to me hes in for some smelly gailforse farts
SHE LOVES YOU MORE THAN HER LIFE, PLEASE DON’T LEAVE HER .
My afternoon snack
But if I eat 20 beers I’m weird
how many turkey can you eat???? 25lb??
you got garlic breath,,,,garlic breath
so glad badlands is still alive what a treasure
I always hated the meat ratio on Big Mac's. Too thin and small patties with all that bread.
In the 1990’s myself and a group of friends went into a McDonalds in London (Next to HMV) and as it was raining outside and we needed somewhere to hide we each ordered the full menu 😂 took us all day to eat every meal they made including the apple pies 😂 milkshakes and soft drinks. I was bunged up for a week.
Thats how i feel after 1 Bigmac 🤪
Joey Chestnut ate 30plus big. The only man who doesn't fear the beard!
IMO lettuce in the box doesn't need to be eaten unless it fell out of the burger after the burger got handled. So pick up the burger, empty the box, then eat the burger and anything that falls out after being handled.
I was guessing you got 15.  But thought you'd only eat 10, so you did beat my expectations.
Oh God.  I don't want to know.  On the bright side you can now get Big Mac sauce as a condiment (for nuggets etc .)
Donating to the stroke association after eating that much mcDs is like donating to your own savings account.
Thanks Beard, now I want a Big Mac........🤘😎
I can barely finish one big Mac with fries
I'm not a fan of those things either.
"was that a gamble?" LOL 10:50
I keep forgetting they are double big Mac's so it's double the amount technically it's only double the patties not double the bread Joey chestnut smashed that one lol
Everytime I watch his videos it  amazes me as to how much he can eat.I can't eat a full  regular big🍔 on its own with no fries.Iget a big🍔meal I save the🍟and eat them later.I can normally eat just over3/4of a regular big🍔& occasionally I actually eat a full big🍔but if I do the fries are saved to have later.I would be absolutely no competition to him.I also don't get how he stays so slim.
You a Rocky 4 fan?
This doesn’t count,  because there is more hamburger buns
It's hard to eat because it is not food
My guess was 10 when you said they were doubles
Just the bread alone in 12 double big macs is crazy. I think Beard is the closest to what a man will feel what pregnancy is like.
0:25 Ms Christmas Potato Head. If there's one thing she needs less of it's garlic bread 10:08 even her hands are chubby yuk
48 burger patties, 36 pieces of bun, 24 slices of cheese, plus all that dodgy sauce. Rather you than me pal.
I challenge you to a Street Fighter game
Women who Try tobe funny are not funny. Very rare a woman will actually be funny
48 patties!? Holy crap!
“Good” causes are the best way to get your money with psychopaths and pedophiles. 😐
Love the food videos pass on the song. I could maybe do 2 doubles..
Seen joey Chestnut eat 32 big mac's
One of the main problems with McDonalds' is that the food is so dry!!!
Is it "husker du"" you are shouting??
I'm jealous. The Big Mac has been my favorite burger since childhood! There's no way anyone could hate them. Whats wrong with you ? lol.
"that was a gamble" might be the best line I have ever heard in one of your videos.
Those are huge cpmpared to the doubles in Canada.
How is it possible to eat so much and remain alive? lol No one's explained that to me yet and until someone does I'm going to have to regard this as sorcery.
38 years ago, 6 of us decided to do a big Mac challenge. 1 friend and I completed 7 big Macs, large fries and a shake (each time). I believe they are smaller now but how many can the beard clear up !!
Does his shirt say " Drago " ? I was just wondering..
has Beard done the Grand Big Mac yet? In my opinion, the superior version of the Big Mac!
"Was that a gamble?" I'm dying
Super Beard
The amount of big macs you eaten is rediculous
Without further ado! This is beardmeatshfhifnftndjdbb, and this is the double big Mac challenge. ;)
McLaxiitives are notoriously effective and efficient
Wow I love for Christmas 🎄 McDonald's foods 😋😋😋I can't wait to buy something at McDonald's
I've never heard so much whinging and whining and one video Mr Beard. But I guess it's true what they say about you pommies and least your living up to your stereotypes ha ha ha.
Never trust a fart!
No link to badlands channel? Pathetic!
I'd like to see you do a Taco Bell Bean Burrito Challenge. Let's see how many you can put away in 30 minutes. I did 23 of them in 1980 when I was 18 years old and weighed in at just 185 pounds (84 +/- KG).
I feel sorry for Linzi having to wash those skiddie thunderpants 😂😂
I see a “smokes poutinery”. Shirt there.  When did you do a challenge there?
Still love “this is kinda like how Dolphins would eat “ remark😂😂 You are the GOAT Adam !!🏆🏆
I feel like I could genuinely do 15-20 Big Macs no chips
Good job....but Joey Chestnut, 32 regular big macs bro-
If you're having that much of a hard time downing 16 double Big Mac's then you could probably double that amount with how anaemic they are in New Zealand.
Definitely the salt will get u 2440mgs per burger. All u need for one day. Fresh burgers from restaurant contain much less. Imagine eating 24,440 mgs of salt? Could be lethal like drinking seawater if not careful.
McDonald's is the devil that is why we hate it and love it
Something in the sauce Wally
The heck is a double big mac 😂 those don't exist where I live lol
Can you say gluttony
Doing 20 of these would be doing 30 double cheese burgers with lettuce so I mean...my hats off to you sir
we don't have them in the states
Badlands chugs clearly doesn’t have the same health protocols.  I’m not sure he even has any feet anymore?  As entertaining as this can be it’s the demise of human society.  Thanks for contributing.
Had to dislike for the X-mas single. Good lord, man.
The only way a McDonald's will fill you up, is if you do an eating challenge. 😄
is this the most expensive challenge at £5 a bigmac. no money back either!
that's her favorite song lol... she most be that girl
I eat three and I feel like it's coming back out. it's something about that sandwich that's bad after the fact
Apparently mcds owes u a double big mac 🤣🤣 u ate 12 had 2 remaining totalling 14 ...so they didnt give u one for free they couldnt add correctly like u didnt 😅😅
I'm pretty sure I could eat three. The fourth would be tough. I seriously doubt I could do five.
Weak
Big macs are soooo dry..would rather do the quarter pounder..way more juicy
I’ll never understand how people love a triple bread sandwich with a tiny smear of meat. I mean it’s genius if you can pull off selling it, but I can’t believe people buy it.
Diggity Dog in Topsail Island NC has a challenge for you to smash. 10 signature hot dogs and a pulled pork bbq sandwich in 30 minutes. Complete the challenge and win a shirt and can koozie
double big mac? all big macs have two patties and its just called a big mac
Joey Chestnut got 32 down in very good time. The beard can eat and has proven so many times over but it's definitely a record that will last some time.
its a crime that they double the meat but only put one cheese
Stroke....you no it's coming 😂😂😂 all in good fun....
You don’t know what it is about McDonalds ??......it’s poison poo poo, that’ll what it is, lol.
It's cuz McDonald's is delicious as it is is cheap food so it's not the best quality which is probably feel like you could go to a real restaurant or 20 things that are almost identical to the Big Mac and you probably do much better 🤣
Wassup Beards’? Absolutely love you guys! Please let me know if you guys ever make it close to Utah. Whhoooscuo! Merry Christmas and many blessings to you and yours always🧡🙏
Finally a challenge i actually tried! watching the clock to see if my time was close to beards! i dont usually eat for speed but quantity is my forte lol I hold the record for most cabbage rolls in a sitting in my province. Question for my fav eater, Beard...I personally dont have a full button/trigger and was wondering do you have a point when your brain tells you to stop or are you cursed ike  me lol?
these seem larger than the US Big Macs am i mistaken or is the McDonalds near me just kind of crap
You could definitely eat more now they’re much smaller then the ones you have in this video.
thats a lot of ammonia in 1 sitting
Those Big Macs look wayyyy bigger than what is served over here in the U.S.
Just so you know, I'll kick his (and anyone else's) butt on that Street Fighter game in the background..
Can't watch this. 1 Big Mac is too many for me.
You should make a video on the after effects of eating so much...farting, sitting on the toilet, barfing...whatever happens to you. That would be quite entertaining!!!
Nothing like chowing down on processed food!
Ok where do you get your t shirts from????
Record is 32 bigmacs in 30 mins
That was only 12.
mamas boy.
12's a good score imo
warmem up in the micro wave next time :o
Homer Simpson ate like that with his head back once! "pigs tend to chew, I'd say he eats more like a duck" 😆
Forget the Big Mac! Go in the morning and get double sausage and egg Mcmuffins (with extra cheese!
Ideally wish i still eat bread products  as i so would try this  i miss big macs
This guy doesn’t eat all the food he does in one go. I know his neighbour, and he’s told me he stops the video and timer about half way through, and then revisits the same spot later on in the day, giving the illusion he’s been eating straight for however long he does. He’s a fraud.
I don't know why, but your videos help me a lot with my bodybuildingcontest prepdiet😂
Love Mrs. Beard
Bigmac and double cheeseburger  and ketchup all RECONSTRUCTED together with fries within outer buns for 'structural integrity'... Can't be beat!!
Come on you can do it
Hi me and mrs bread
Joey did 32 big macs
We got McDonalds in Londonderry when we visited a couple of months ago and our "Grand Macs" were SO dry. ugh.
that food looks so fake and terrible
Where did you get your street fight video game machine from I what one
I have never seen any one suffer so much while eating Mickey D's. Usually my suffering doesn't start until half an hour after i eat Mickey D's. I love the place but all the preservatives in everything ruin my night 😂
A little extra fluff around the midriff won't hurt is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard
That was lame
You would be better off ordering five guys instead of the notorious Double Big Mac
I really like his humor about Christmas being a good time of year to gamble with a fart...right up my ally.
Would you believe i eat at mcdonalds all the time but ive never had a Big Mac? it's true, if my cheap ass is going to spend that much i get a crispy chicken or a chicken club, other than that it's plain cheeseburgers and small fries..lol I bet this was really hard, i can't even imagine how your belly felt afterwards.
I want a Big Mac now. 😋
I’ve been watch all your videos amazing and what amazing couple u are kisses Jules from cornwall cxxxxx
Guaranteed McDiarrhea
Tell me how to download the video send me the link come on man I want to hear you play guitar and sing
Why you got a musical channel out come on help me up without channel I want to listen to you sing and play guitar come on man answer me back send me the link something I want to watch that video Mr chug just showed your video come on hit me up with Darlene
You must have great plumbing in that place.....goddamn....ur poor toilet.
Love love love Mrs Beards delivery
If the record was 3, I think I could do it.
Love the banter between you and Mrs. Beard especially at 10:55.  Thank you two for putting out such entertaining content. Cheers!
They barely put Mac sauce!
my kid loves to watch he is rofl-ing when you speed up the video , but you eat too fast cant understand how you enjoy anything?
Only 12? That's WEAK brother. Shows truely how far behind the real professionals you are, just being honest.
A double big Mac has 7 layers big Mac 5 so 2 = it u need 21.5 double big macs 2 = the record.
Now there is the Chicken Big Mac... time for another challenge
Can’t imagine how much entertainment mrs bears gets from watching dude just slam these bigmacs 😂
I have to admit it was a nice try me I could not get even half of that down I don't know if you'll ever read this but I would love to see you do a challenge on how many chicken nuggets you can eat from McDonald's And with the big Mac next time you have one put some barbecue sauce on it From McDonald's you will Like the flavor I guarantee it
I saw chestnut do a big mc one, are you now the champ
All that talking for 30 seconds…could have got half a Mac into you.
Tilting your head back is what's known as the "sword swallowing" position.  We were taught that in basic training as part of doing CPR.  It enables one to clear out any debris in the throat so I imagine it would allow food to go down a bit easier during competitive eating.  Just a thought. lol
Have you ever tried the McGangbang? If not you will hate it worse than the double big mac lmao
big macs just dont look like that in america those look pretty good seem like they are larger
GARLIC BREAD
😱👍👍🤣
shitty mac dolans comercial. a murrayca fuck yeeha
Only just got into your channel (very good) i totally agree with you about MacDonalds (yuch) nowhere near a Five Guys so eat Whoppers when i do eat a burger (Sorry).
Im going to have stop watching you. You keep making hungry even after I have just ate.
Dude, what would make for a fascinating video would be if you'd go and have a full MOT-style health-check? You look like you're in decent shape, but it really would be fascinating to see how you liver etc may (or may not) have been affected by all these eating challenges you've done - what do ya think?
believe it was 32 not 30 that he did. So maybe that's why you got 16 not 15 xD
?know that song 'are we humans' by the killers; I heard a rumor it's a "dolphin medley"
They look so dryed! Poor thing!!
Also next time get some sweet and sour sauce. It makes a big mac even tastier
What makes it a double big mac?
Yuk! Don't give them dogs ya money
Hes makes me feel so hungry for the food hes eating! Gutted I'm so skint and cant afford a big mac.
WTF is a double Big Mac? *_* we need this in Germany
Nothing like snorting a Big Mac! 😂
Just heard the song I love it  Nice song very nice 👌👍👏😀😊😎👌
Rubbish burgers, the double one, doubly so. Grey mush is a better description. Should be retirled: Big Grey Mush Mac. Burger sauce is nice, tho.
Where's the chips?
After Joey Chestnut you are the champ in BIG MAC category i think :)
Pro eaters amaze me. I weigh 260 pounds and i can maybe eat 2 double Big macs.
Making people laugh while they were eating ... that never went wrong. I hope Mrs. Beard knows Heimlich.
I see your elf chillin on the shelf lol
McDonald's set the big mac standard by employing kids to make the worst assembled burgers
Hey Adam that was a spring mac in a box 😆👍
Well I’ve never seen a dolphin 🐬 go to space ? Maybe if they made another tree house of horror 😂
The amount of sodium is all those burgers can't be good for you 🤣 but well done all the same 🤙🏼
McDonalds hamburgers are not that great but their fries are the best.
damn just got that song out of my head a few days ago... now its back
Those bigmacs look bigger than normal
"Was that a gamble?" = Comedy genius xxx
Christmas is the season to shit you pants?
Adam after 9: its getting rough already! Me after 3: one bite more and its going backwards
it never does
Great tune When's the album coming out?
Considering how much you hate Big Macs, I’m surprised you did this one
You have a blessed Soul have a blessed day and blessed life doing what you love and thanks for all you do for us
5:30. Can I get that autographed shirt
I know I am like 4 months too late for the fundraiser but I definitely just downloaded Garlic Bread!!
Your like the lower midgrade of pro eaters
1:56 he wanted to say something else
im not going to lie i liked that "Garlic Bread" lets go and i like how you and your sweetheart look together
You are the chips master!
Please go to the bathroom..you will feel better.
Bro ... awesome video game in the background one if the best games from the 90's ......
The "big Mac" here in the U.S.A. are puny.  I want the one you are eating.  Literally drooling.  Well... not the one YOU are eating... but one just like it.
I wanna eat 4 right now. Wish I could. I can't get out now, but tomorrow it may happen.
What is a double big mac exactly???
You have sesame seeds in your beard. 🍔😒
****. 🍺🌈
"I can't stands no more" popeye reference Beard?
LOL...your bitching during this video was the funniest yet.  You are hilarious.
Boy you did pretty great in eating those 12 double hamburgers wow. 😎
You recently have a huge obsession with randy 😂 I think, personally you need to settle it once and for all! 1 on 1 challenge timed! 80oz steak with sides winner takes all 👌
Sorry but I'm not into it. Not feeling it.
You and Mrs. Beard are so funny. I've been to the U.K. once and loved it. I definitely never thought to try McDonald's in another country, but does the beef actually taste like beef there? In the U.S. McDonald's burgers are like ground cow parts. Unknown "meat". The beef I had in London tastes so much better than anything here. The dairy there was fantastic too.
your woman is a sadist
Joey Chestnut - 32 Big Macs! 😂
You used the mirror effect it looks like we are driving on the wrong side of the road haha
Weird question, but I've always been curious with professionals, such as yourself, as to what y'all do with all that food after!?
Mrs beard is class 😜
That video has been edited many times. Don't buy any of it. Fake
Have you ever set up and prepared to do challenge and after one or two bites, you realize this selection was a mistake?
Matt is my Hero i love that guy
What are his 2 catchphrases ? They sounds like food scoops  And H2 O.
So the double Big Mac is a huge slider
You guys are couple goals. ❤☺
I wonder how many McRibs he can eat?
I agree - a little more sauce - they looked dry - McDonalds should have endorsed you ! 😂👍🏻
i like it how his wife slides the big macs towards him while he takes a sip of his water 😂 6:16
Boring like other british entertainers
I haven't had a double Big Mac for years. But I always get extra sauce...
doubles look bigger there than they do here in Canada. love your vids tho man!! your a beast!!
Fascinated by your vids!  Couple of questions though, why cram so much food in at a time? Is is to do with technique or to save time?  And do you swallow huge chunks without chewing?  How often do you do huge food challenges? Do you have to leave a certain amount of time between eating such large meals? Cheers, keep the vids coming!
do most tripple cheeseburgers 🍔
I just heard your song for the first time today.  Brilliant and I'll be waiting for an album.
Good challenge no doubt, but the preparation is not quite there, why try it for real then ? A big bowl under too collect all sallat, and drinkin water in between too get it down is importent .. i guess the record is 32 by this man : https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-jose-competitive-eater-joey-chestnut-crushes-world-record-in-big-macs/2249095/. Of course everybody has there special food challanges talent, mine is bolognese but not any worldrecord of course
DO THE 1,500 protein challenge. EricTheElectric did it!!!!!! CHALLENGE ONNNNNN
Love you Bro. Greetings from Germany
That was nuts!  The double Big Mac must’ve been a UK gimmick as we didn’t have it over here in the states. Go figure!🤣🤢🤮
7:48 The old Jesus lord help me face....
Why doesn't the 🇺🇸 have the double bm?
Now I wanna know how many big tastys/double quarters he can take down 😂
Would be cool if you wear a heart rate monitor and display it while you it lol
Sorry, Beard, but Chestnut did 31 (?) Big Macs. Even though you did 14, with them being doubles, that just comes out to 28. Good effort!
Big macs are to dry, you would be better with big tasty. They have a nice sauce in them which I wish I could buy.
I would need extra Big Mac sauce
You gotta add the garlic bread song as your intro music. Love it 😍
Garlic bread
Do a chicken nugget challenge
Let’s have a moment of silence for beards toilet.....
Beard how do you know what's to dangerous when committing to a challenge?
These things are dry af.
FUCK NOOO IM NOT DOWNLOADING THAT TRASH 🤢🤮
You are impressive and insane but with dashes of humbleness. The fastest fast food eaten fast, and I seen the last caveman do something similar, you should check him out
I wonder when the writers of the English Thesaurus will finally recognise the word "Youtuber" as being a synonym of "prostitute".
If I'm not mistaken, Molly beat chestnut big Mac record...
No the Big Mac sauce? Looks dry.
Nice Street fighter 2 arcade!
Joey Chestnut: Hold my small water
i enjoy a good big mac maybe once a year...gotta say watching you choke those down was both amazing and horrifying at the same time...lol
Hi Adam and Mrs B,   love the channel , been watching it a while now ,   I've an idea if you are ever stuck for inspiration,    arrange with your sister , she can phone anytime and instruct you to 'Eat the fridge,     yes you have to empty it or Mrs B gets to chose a forfeit.  Happy New year to you both ,   Mark
NEVER DO MUSIC AGAIN............................................................ But i love the chatter and comics, pretty much whole reason i watch the vids. since the competetive eating is getting crushed by a UK famele (Comon Beard). Hallarious Ep. tho
at the begging of vid ther was a drone shot is this your drone and if so what do u pilot i fly the bebop 2 drone and agen thanks for the vids
Dolphins don't have hands how can they eat like this?
very surprised you encountered so few structural issues. they are more like a pile of food that tastes nice than a burger.  by the way, top marks for the quizzical, earnest investigation as to whether Mrs Beard does indeed like garlic bread
I seriously did a spit take when I first saw Mrs Beard looking like that. Now I’m in trouble.
I work at maccies and I feel sorry for the person who had to make those double big macs 🙏😂
And the US menu doesn't have this why?
hey Adam love all your videos think I would have felt sick with that amount of burgers and that hersleys chocolate bar so you did great with that getting to the y great achievement, merry Xmas by the way and hope you had a good xmas day, think it's time a baby beard came along to follow in your footsteps eventually, i love big macs but look bigger than where I am so not that fair as wish they were as big here, anyway godbless and love watching your videos, would love to try some challenges myself but don't think I could eat as much as you so well done x
Hello comment reader... HAPPY HOLIDAYS 🥳👌🏿
My mans says it aint hard going in its just hard coming out
Those bigmacs are bigger than the ones in London.. wtf? The ones in London look like miniatures compared to those... London is such a scam city
That Garlic Bread track is a load of wank.
Love me some Badlands Chugs.  Looking forward to his into. to the Nathans Hot Dogs eating contest.
This is sad & wasteful. Your body must be f.....ed
I haven’t eat a Big Mac since COVID. The McDonald’s around where I live hire anyone and now with COVID I’m scared to eat out. I miss it so
Over here in the states we don't have a double big mac...
OMG.....I can't imagine the McDiarrea after this one...
Bet you felt rough as a badgers asshole after this. I would actually prefer a hangover than the McDonald's msg come down 🤮
My ocd is going wild! 12 eaten 2 on the table ... 14? Someone correct me or I won’t sleep 😆
I wonder how long the average Beard turd is? I bet it wouldn't look out of place in a snake charmer's basket!
I've downloaded, its a very catchy tune...
He will be hungry in 2 hours 🙈
But... but... what if the buns were made of garlic bread? That might have helped?
Was that Liam Gallagher?
I feel bad for u my god. Ur stomach Prob hates you
Shitmas cringle
i thought my 4 double big macs and 4x large fries was good ahaha
You need to try a Big Mac with BBQ sauce on it! 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Anyone know where I can buy the DRAGO top from? Cheers
Your making me starve
Merry Christmas you are so much fun to watch. Thank you for the video
Gonna have to beat this record.   Anyway- a challenge for you Beard- Tesco Finest Ultimate Pork Pies. Huge thing for £6 and I got it gone in 25 minutes.
We need a pigs in blanket special  😃
They gave you 14 not 16
After your most disliked food challenge you should do a kebab challenge.
Do you live in London or England
That was a lot of mcdonald's big mac's in this youtube food challenge video i can tell you are tired of big mac's the content was silly fun
That is A: Not how dolphins eat and B: Not what people say about dolphins but i’m sure the meat was going to your brain and doing something wrong
geeze man whats your upper body routine haha I need to go find food
That song makes me want to blow my brains out
woooo ur poor tummy lol eat eat eat puuuuuuuck eat eat lol
Why do you need all of that water ?
Mrs beard ha ha ha ha she loved chucking the next big mac in for him lol
charity money shaving your beard off!  Do it!
Tell mrs beard it’s not a double Big Mac because a double Big Mac would be an extra 3 buns too. Double Big Macs are a rip off  It’s just two extra patties haha
17 Big Macs is “bad” And there’s me thinking 4 is an accomplishment
My parents walked in due to all the moaning noises and what better explanation than telling them im watching a guy shove meat into his mouth and he is not liking it 😂
Dolphins aren't smarter than humans use 10% dolphins use 20%
Don't touch that mouse
Stepped your game up this year didn't you beard! Merry Christmas mate
Getting your song now mate 👍👍
HOW ARE YOU FEELING BURGER BOY?!
OMG BADLANDSCHUGS?! ADAM AND BADLANDS SHOULD MAKE A SONG!
Were u even able to poop after
Guess british MC sucks ass xD bec in holland it does not fill me up at all xD (i mean after 4-5 it will ofcourse not gonna manage 10 haha
Molly did 34 Big Macs.
The necrotic pancreas is beginning to take its toll.
I proper hate the quality of McDonald's rubber burgers
Ease up on the forearms bro 😜
I always watch these videos at night and it makes me so hungry
BADLAND CHUUUUUUUUGSSSSS
I live a 4.5 hour drive from the nearest Mc. Donald’s.  You lucky bastard.  Torture for you but SO gd good for me who hasn't had it in 10 years.
I keep looking at the print on his shirt too quickly and reading it as “oregano” 🤣🤣🤣
I love the smokes shirt in the back!
You know wgen u get ketchup on ur chin u jus wipe it o but does it soak into you beard?
a double big Mac? so a 90s real big Mac lol
I like the picture on the wall cold pizza but it's hard to eat cold pizza
Mrs. Beard tell him to keep the music going
I think I'm in love with garlic bread good song man keep going
My favourite couple ❤️ have a Merry Christmas 🎄🎄and great video as always and Mrs.Beard looked amazing 🤩
Ur gonna crap ur pants or have a heart attack or both 😬
Litty intro
Had a chunk of apple stuck up my nose once hurt like crazy was too big to blow it out so i just had to sniff it back in. 2/5 starsWouldnt reccomend
Trying to look like Jared Leto 🤣🤣
Molly would destroy joey
I got so confused for a moment if I clicked on a Chugs or Beard vid.
pain
you look like Drago at the end of Rocky 4
What a pile dog shit
respect And nice shirt
Big macs are rough. I dont care for them much myself. If you decide to do this again i would recommend extra cheese and extra sauce so your not eating a super dry burger.  Good video! I always enjoy watching your videos.
Please attempt to eat the most tunnocks teacakes possible, i did 6 in 81 seconds
Is it terrible my eyes are more drawn to Street Fighter in the background, than the burger feasting?  Hahaha
I had a stroke age 47 3yrs ago stroke association is great also different strokes who support working age stroke survivors xx
I think that was the first snot rocket launched during an eating challenge ..... well done 👏
I give you credit for having the balls to make that music video but I'll never listen to it let alone buy it. It was horrible! Good job on the double Big Mac though beard... Oh her name isn't Mac... guess I meant Mac's. Happy Holidays
please stop the preforming arts diarrhea. Back to be a champion
But chestnut did 32 standard ones.
This is turning into arrogant shyte. Why by be a hippy wanker?
what camera is he using?
Single downloaded and set as my ringtone great work mr and mrs beard have a good christmas
How do you not weigh 200kg's lol
See that....... Made In Yorkshire 🤍 Merry Christmas 🎅
everybody gangsta till you click on a video an Badlands Chugs show up
I like big macs, but there is NOT any way I could have eaten that many! lol
How am I supposed to see the Christmas single if I can't touch my mouse
😂😂😂 I had 1 of these today (with chips) and it was the first time EVER I was full from a mac's 😂😂 1 ?
Beard, it's been like 3 days and I can't get that song out of my head!!! Thanks for ruining garlic bread for me lol. Great stuff man!
If he die's.... He "die's 😂
Didn't Joey Chestnut eat 32 big macs? Beating Matt Stonies record
Badlands chug!
Talk about coming full circle, I remember stumbling across your channel 18 months ago and giving you some shtick about talking to your missus off camera.  Now you've fully integrated her, when present and it's really wholesome so GJ and merry christmas Mr and Mrs Beard
I'm glad you're not in music business... I mean that Norsk image and then soft pop songs? Nah... stick to eating!
Wait! What? You ordered 15 double Big Macs and a diet coke? The McDonalds employee was like WTF???
Oh god someone else doing a cringe song what's wrong with people
You should do the KFC gravy burger
Would love to see a Christmas charity single with you and Mark from Ladbaby!
Yeah, ordering extra sauce would in theory help.  Adds moisture without the drinking the fluids. The only caveat is that sometimes just ordering "extra" sauce means they MURDER it in sauce, which overwhelms everything and makes it soupy.  I order extra sauce but sometimes it is way too much.  I just want like 50% more, not 200%.  Great video!
300k views on this and only 165k on music video, WHO IS NOT GIVING THIS BEARD THE PROPER VIEWS ON HIS NEW TUNES ??????  Go watch it and give it a thumbs up! Or your Christmas turkey will be dry..LOL
I want to see you do a noodle challenge, any flavour instant noodles, see how many packs you can eat.
i got one yesterday and was a burger short, i got 3 patties instead of 4 xD
Think I could do 4 and then admit myself to the hospital for Heart pain.
WTF intro. Lmfao
These vids are just so legendary. Keep 'em coming, i've got 10 months worth to catch up on.
How
Doesn’t matter what mood I’m in , beard always brightens my day !  Merry Christmas
Thats pretty cool to get Badlands to do an intro. Gambling on video was funny, glad you didnt lose. That was a lot, had to have sucked. Another great video
I bought 1 double Big Mac meal last night and I couldn’t even finish the chips 😂
song downloaded.
DAMNIT Adam: that song is too dang catchy!
Eat The Stove Top Stuffing Mix - 😛
ohhhhhh Yuk! Salty horridness lol Well done BEARD
I don’t think Joey would beat Molley, she is a freak of nature 😂
Here before it becomes famous on Facebook lmao
Merry Christmas Mr. And Mrs. Beard.
I'd hold yer "goo rag" instead of Mrs. Beard!!!
What advice would you give someone trying to get into competitive eating as far as training goes for the stomach.... What works best?
Lmfaooo he looks like Chris Evans
for me its entertaining how supportive she is of his eating challenges
Is it always a couple food challenge and then 800 calories for five days, do you ever eat normal for  a week and what is that like ... and I doubt dolphins are smarter than humans unless they can do algebra.  Be well dude.
Yo bro your insane love da video happy holidays
Was this Ivan Dragos diet before he fought Rocky?
Go to Bristol and whoop Ol’ Randy at the Blue Circle slider challenge!! I got no doubt you can double his count! I Enjoy your videos, keep em up!!!
I love Mrs. Beards driving glasses and Santa hat.🤩
Try eating 100 spicy nuggets from Wendy’s, I only got 40😂
BIG MAC, Mr beard, you are talented
You have an arcade in the background that's so cool!!!
My christmas came early this year with an awesome S/O from the Beard himself. Sending love from GA  and cheers to another year of great content 🍻

The 💩 your gonna have. Fitting really. A right Yule 🪵

Those burgers are bigger than ours in the states!! We are getting ripped off!!😳😂
Hey John, how's Yoko?
Hello Adam. Watched pretty much every episode of your videos. More addicted to your videos than you are to food!! Merry Xmas to you and Mrs Beard.
No wonder they were falling apart the way they were thrown at you across the table.  Merry Xmas 🎅🏻🎄
Got me loving Garlic bread now!!!!🤗🙌💪🎁🎄🙏
What a stupid song! Do like the vids though
Adam i suggested this abt 2 weeks ago 😁😁😁😁
If Mcdonalds food look like the advertisements diarrhea wouldnt be a common problem with their food LOL
So I have to be honest with my curiosity,  do you grab a 5 gallon bucket after your done and get rid of all the food you eat?  I don't understand how your digestive system could process this much food without you being ill for a day or 2 but you do this all the time?  The amount of food you eat,  I don't understand how it fits in your chest  cavity let alone your stomach?  And your visit to the bathroom a few hours later must be a 4 flusher...
I love the song
Not a fan of double big macs, they absolutely need extra sauce and cheese. Grand big Mac is much better.
Because of you i become a simp of garlic breeaad 🎶🎶
that's right eat that lettuce u gotta get your veggies in !!!
Great effort ✌️
I always get extra sauce on my Bic Macs.
Who cleans your toilet? lol
Love your videos but so over the song sorry
Never fails I always seem to watch him eat food and then I get hungry
I always knew you was part dolphin
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You really made a Christmas album? Hilarious. Good stuff man lol
Anyone notice he sounds like imalexx when he says “like garlic bread” and “girl who likes” it sounds satisfying for some reason 😂
Love the video the song is horrible tho
Love how Mrs beard delivered the burgers. Eat that bitch😂
where is this in the charts then ...?
I eat macydees and feel like I had the flu jab
Do you know how much I hate that song now. It's been stuck in my head for days.....DAYS.......
Marvel does the most epic crossover... BeardMeatsFood: Hold my chug!
dropped a like solely for the SF2 Champion edition arcade machine, fantastic choice my friend!
These look dry as all hell
Big Macs are ugly, sour and so much bread or what it is...;)
Some comments are a bit harsh today chill people
Double Big Macs are the reason Covid keeps mutating. . .
That intro made me double check if I clicked on a beard video or badlands
Hi Mr and Mrs Beard. I've watched a number of your videos and always enjoy them. I love that you both sing, besides eat. Thank you! Papa Bob, Washington, Missouri, USA.
Like for street fighters II
And not 1 big mac looked like the 1 in the posters or adverts lol just a big pile of mess and lettuce haha
Could you do the cheese melts from mc ds challenge please
I have to ask this, when will you marry Ms. Beard? She's a good woman, what are you waiting for? Lol
Hey man. Found your channel pretty recently and I've become semi-addicted, love the constant positive energy and the insane quantities you eat. Hope you have a great Christmas this year despite all the ups n downs! ps. you're a hat away from looking amish in that suit for the garlic bread music video ;P
I wouldn't be surprised if Notorious B.O.B. ate 30 of those, he did 67 plain hamburgers.
Oysters seem like the move anyone hosting an oyster eating comp has to be loaded.
😂😂 also .. where do we start with this vid  .. the areal drone footage 👌🏼 the Big Mac counter at the top 👍🏼 or the snot ROCKET 🚀 😂😂😂💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Has anyone ever actually saw him swallow the food ??? I think he is cheating.
Mr Beard . I have downloaded the banging single 👌🏼 is brill . And Great job this year keeping us all entertained ☺️☺️🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Be so kool for every burger that pops on screen after you eat one it has Mrs beards burp sound bite lol merry xmas you 2 x
“If he dies he dies” obviously beard you know what that’s from haha 😆 I’ll I be honest you are bloody killing it this December my friend but my other half wouldn’t say so as keep singing I think I am in love with the girl who loves garlic bread lol 😂
One would be enough for me, let alone 12..jezzzz. Good show brother and God bless you for raising funds for the Stroke Association. Merry Christmas to you and Mrs. Beard.
Seriously with that stupid song? On every single video. Please just stop. It's rubbish
Dude, please stop with the song. It's annoying.
Smokes Poutinerie t shirt there?! Went in Toronto a few years back. What a treat!!
Your wife’s a beast eat those veggies boy!!! Plop next burger 🍔
Omg 😱 I’ll never eat another Big Mac!!!! Ooohhh double big Mac you’ve only eaten 2!!! Happy holidays mr / miss beard! Lizard 🦎 cinnamon

I have been watching you for a while now. your videos never bore me. Keep up the good work!
Brave soul. I haven’t eaten Mickey D’s in about 15 years man. Their entire menu is trash lol
Tubby the elf.
A buffet owners worst nightmare
Pls do a challeng with mrbeast resturant
As you get older and continue your quest for the elusive triple point, gas liquid and solid at the same time, remember what a surprise is. A fart with a lump on the end.
You should do the Bruce's chocolate cake challenge of Matilda lol 😁😁😁
Hey beard. Love the channel, been watching for awhile. Must say your double big macs are twice the size of the ones available to us in Canada!! Happy holidays and the best to you both!!
I find with the double big Mac and double quarter pounders they need the equivalent sauce to meat ratio as with the normal amount of sauce and veg it's to damn dry grrrrrrrrrrrr
Could Think of better things to spend my money on but ok , I would also like to play on the street fighter 2 arcade game please
I asked for this and u did it how I’d never know lol 😂 🔥🔥
Legand eater
damn i didnt even know a dbl big mac was a thing...
I ate 20 of these things and around 50 of them came out of me in about 30 seconds, that must be a record surely!
Garlic bread. I have the song suck in my head 🤣 and my son won’t stop singing it haha 👍🏻
I can’t eat two 😂
Love your videos but I’m sorry LadBaby will be number 1 this year,
bro you will not become a true Santa, when you don't do Claus. Vikings don't f**k around. Your best gain will come from your best give.And man, please do give always your best. Gift Ms Beard a baby. Gift yourself a holiday, and do a random shirt cannon event, where you are gifting your BMF shirts away ;) Have a merry Christmas and sexy new year ;)
Just downloaded it on iTunes  it would be great if we got it to the top 5
Damn I literally was wondering if someone was able to eat more than one. I was at the drive thru with my daughter eating a Double Big Mac and very happy with the recent McDonalds range extension happy said: Can we do a hamburger, cheeseburger, double cheeseburger, triple cheeseburger, quarter pounder, double quarter pounder, big mac and double big mac! Then I see this and I am like 🤩 WOW
This is far bigger than any wet dream ive ever had 🔥 my favourite order on their menu
Smashing it
Street Fighter

You have the best shirts man!
Great vlog beard 👌 I had trouble eating one mc double burger let alone the amount you put away🤣🤣🤗
I did 7 of these things as a non competitve eater
In Scotland a chug is not something you want to be in comp with another man in
Love the suffering he always clearly displays
That itunes xmas song is a joke lol so cringe stick to eating food lol
Don't think you'll be allowed to upload a  'Chug Off' video that's a totally different website
R.I.P YOUR TOILET LOL
I’d love to try this challenge 💪🏻👌🏻
600lbs chugs gravy and Pepsi, sensible.
Would love to see a normal ‘what I eat in a day’ or what you eat the day after a food challenge !
Just bought your charity single garlic bread mr beard. All I can say is it’s just as well it’s for  charity lol. Great work buddy.

Merry Christmas
Still love you music video "...garlic bread..." 👏
Its in my music library as we speak👍
You might be done with "Garlic Bread" but you sneaky bastard, its been echoing in my head for the past 24 hrs....to the point where when I went shopping, I bought all the makings for a wicked garlic bread turkey stuffing for Christmas.  I suspect the song will not end in my head afterwards.   Thanks for the musical gift and happy holidays to you both.
We just watched this with our 3 year old, who is a huge fan, and she wanted to know why you didn't eat any chips haha
Can we have a bloopers video 😂🤣👍🏻🎄
Talk about multitasking. That's  amazing. Have a  great Christmas. Love you both. X
sounds corny I know but what a crap year and your videos have cheered me up and no doubt others, here’s to a great 2021 and I’m gonna download the song later today, been singing “garlic bread” all morning 😂 merry Christmas mate, much love to you and mrs beard

Can you change that game to Galaga please Beard?
What about the future videos due covid20
Cold in UK ? Are you kidding me ?! we have sometimes -50 Celsius !
I think your nose was abit "PECKISH" as you were filling the whole under it so it was jealous.  Hahahaha
Might have to unsubscribe after that garlic bread video 🤣
Hi from Australia I've watched u eat a lot of big plates with good food maybe the prob is u can't eat ribbish food

Mrs. Beard just sliming them down on the table 9:02/10:10 especially haha.9:30 your killing me 🤣. 41:14 a good luck timer stop great attempt beard and video💪🏽.

Not 2 shabby. Can't get ur song out of my head lol

I downloaded the single!! Merry Christmas to you and Mrs Beard 🎄
Gotta love that GARLIC BREAD
Try this https://youtu.be/qi8Ybju_2V0
I’m going to download beard’s song!
What about a broken biscuit challenge
Double Big Mac? what is this sorcery? in Austria we have the grand big mac but this is just crazy o_O
Ms. Beard also sings well!!!
I Need this Burger in Austria!!!!!!
That song is stuck in my head! Thanks Adam, there is always a song stuck in my head. Why not yours? Garlic bread...
Amazing, bruv!
Getting down to mystery jets. Beard I’m impressed
Beard, you should do a big five guys order of your favorite burger. If you can do 12 double big macs then I'm sure that you can get 15 five guys burgers in ya! No problem!!
What does he actually say when he yells at the beginning of the video? It sounds like huskerdu!
Was wondering if we could get weight added to these videos too? Love the content
At 4:50 he exactly sounded like Arnold
Big bowl of ketchup might help lol
Have garlic bread on repeat on Spotify for you beard.
mcdonalds = french for beware the lumpy farts !!
as a rocky fan .... you s.o.b lol jk happy holidays beard 😂
Epic Drago shirt.  Me likes.
Beautiful burger slide from mrs beard. just saying
I love  the cold pizza fan club poster
Am I the only one who felt the burger up my own nose😂
Double Big Mac's holy...Your poor butt....lol
in canada they are tiny you could eat easily 20
Cold in the UK is heatwave here in Canada mate
Charity Christmas Remix with badlands chugs please 😃
Sorry beard but that’s a lot of food so good luck 🤞🏻
48 maccies burger patties and 36 pieces of bun, impressive, also feel very sorry for mrs beard in the 24 hours that followed this💩🤢🤣
you need a hair cut beard
Haha, the real question is, did you throw up when Linds gave you the Heimlich at the end there? :P  Keep up the good work and hope you and Linds have a great Christmas.
No idea why I checked today but it turns out I had enough change in my iTunes to give the song a buy lol. Hope it hits the top of the charts for charity as you become the next Buble haha
What kinda car is that? That thing looks awesome
I'm making bbq chicken with Mac n cheese while watching this lol
When do u do all yer shagging after eating like that almost every 23-24 hours lol
I feel like this channel sounded like a good idea at first...
Why do they all look so dry? Figured there would be cheese between the patties or something.
Lettuce doesn't count.
Ok just wondering mr beard do you actually have singing and musical skills as well?
Thank you for growing your hair,  it beautiful. Lol.  You look so hot ! Loved your music.  Hello to mrs beard.  Any chance for a little beard anytime in the future.?
They are a mission to eat, great work Beast! Happy Christmas and have enjoyed the videos.... nearly bought the street fighter arcade at Costco but the Mrs was giving me the evil eye 🧿.......
Did try telling you about the extra sauce and cheese to moisten that baby up Adam 🤦‍♂️😂
They are huge, that has to be the Current record, And BTW its impossible to get it randy clean, that guy would eat the box too 😂😂
.69 cents, nice round number. Just buy the single, I did. Do it for Moz!! Even though he wouldn’t approve of this challenge😱
I feel almost unpatriotic that I, an American, have never heard of a double Big Mac until this video
i LOVE mrs beards glasses
You should do a McRib food challenge!!!
Great job, I'm not sure if you knew, but Molly Schulyer did 34 regular big macs. Pretty sure it's an unofficial record. lol
Yes! you need to eat the lettuce! You are not going to poop for a week otherwise! That song is too bloody catchy! 59p you say...
Yummmm😋😛😜🤪😝👍 Lol love de hat's lol😂🤣
BTW, Dolphins are not smarter than humans or else they would have McDonald’s swim through underwater
Always wondered does the food taste any good when it's cold?
Lol the single is on spotify too🤣
12 doubles is unbelievable your some beast stomach like an IKEA car park
Ok what gives I saw him pull that Big Mac out and it’s way bigger than the USA one not the doubling of the meat but the circumference.....
I didn’t see or hear “with cheese”. No cheese doesn’t help with the dryness, I think a dolphin would have been smart enough to get them with cheese or at least extra sauce.
Didn't know that Badlands and yourself are friends ! You 2 are the only ones on my notifications . Badlands "Chugs" and Beard M"eats" Food . All you need !
The main problem I found with the double big mac, is that they only double the meat. So there's bugger all sauce or anything else in the burger.
Do 100 cheeseburgers
That was my sister who brought the food to the car haha
Can we get an autograph from Mrs beard
I always find McDonald's burgers actually taste better when reheated in a microwave...that says a lot about their food.
Great job bud!
You should try Burger King the Big King XL challenge. They are just like big mac's but twice the size. I think they taste better to.
Well done sir! You started looking green towards the end.
I had 1 and it was dry. I can't imagine eating more 😂
Please don’t sing
Why are you not fat?
The big macs in Calgary are half the size you are eating!
How many subway footlongs can you eat ?!!!!
Irish people rep all english.
How can you eat them without ketchup, look dry.
I would love enjoying eating big macs im hungry
Did those give you the McSquirts? LOL
Those double mac's look huge compared to Canadian doublers.  MMMM...
Some sauce/dip would help out here!
What is your top score on that street fighter
The holidays are difficult, my mom had a stroke when I was a freshman in high school after heart surgery, she suffered complications and fought for years, fell, and then died due to being overdosed in a nursing home where she was supposed to just strengthen her legs for two weeks and come home... so thank you for this for your song. My mom passed on Black Friday 2015 and your videos make the holidays easier.
That was still very impressive. Well done.
*orders 50 double big macs* "Wait that's illegal, you can't be having a party at home" "Oh no it's Mr Beard. Nevermind"
Lindsey with a Mac drop 😆
Just downloaded it pal, NUMBER 10!!!  What the hell!!  Brilliant that. Ladbaby smashing it too. It’s the first thing I’ve bought on iTunes for over 10 years so good luck.
Every time I see your partner now I hear in my head....garlic bread 🎷🔊🎼🎤🎸 Awesome video man 😂
Hell yea love seeing the videos plz do a HUGE news years eve video.   Just to pick on randy plz do the hat Just to mess with him 😁😁
That was it. Thought if I heard that stupid shit again I'd unsubscribe . Done. Fuck this shit
OOOHHHH God what has happened!!!!! no more of this garlic bread pls i beg you pls...
Dude that was impressive for u to eat that much McDonald's, I felt bad for ur insides but still impressive.  Oregon awaits u dude
Did she say causeing a que? To the lady.

Double quaterpounders are loads better
How you fellin burger boy.. 🤣😂 Well played Mrs Beard👌
Pls make video of your weight before and after eating
Pls make video of your weight before and after eating
Rice pudding is clearly your thing
I heard that Randy Santel is such a beast that he snorts the crumbs like they're...well you know. Icing sugar!  🤣
I’m waiting for that BeardLands collab...
You are right I can't remember the last time I ate at Mickey D's
I love her she so funny plus I love watching you eat
I really have no idea why i always watch those videos when im starving to death haha
You should have @ least gotten some ketchup out, I think it would have helped you choke it down easier. You should have ordered some fries with that! Lol😁 Merry Christmas!! 🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲
Was that a gamble
9:07 "This is rough already...." "So this is number ten."
Fairplay I can only do 2 but the meals
Should've made the title "the great big mac massacre"
Haaaaaahhhh, he got the Big Mac toots!
48 burgs is a good run dude
Holy what a challenge. Beast
I’m wondering how many non brits would understand the word shnozz 😂  Great vid as always beard. Wishing you and your loved ones a lovely Christmas x
Stay safe over there beard..I just heard of your covid 20..err I mean stronger covid 19
I love Mrs. Beard…She’s awesome
Please please please drop the link for them driving glasses lmao
Hope you bang mrs beard in those glasses she was wearing!🍻
INSTANTANEOUS DOWNLOAD
Darn you Beard - I woke up to ""She Eat Garlic Bread" in my head!
This is what iv been waiting for Adam 👊🏻💯 and if u love Donner meat try German donner kebab the boss box meal INSANE🔥🔥
try this with the double quarter pounder, imo its a lot hard to eat than a double big mac
Let us Canadian buy the song on the Canadian itunes store. It won't let us buy it there.
Never mind the single, the question on everyone’s lips is have they caught this Randy Santa guy yet?
They need to put sauce between the extra two patties. I found it a tad dry.
I was thinking you could eat 12 and you did but dear god thats a lot and good one
The festive thing about double Big Macs are if you eat enough of them you start to look like Santa Claus
I still can't hear what the song says
Not gonna lie the garlic bread song has been stuck inside my head. I even played it in my car speakers just to see people's reactions when driving to work. Lol 😂
Unexpected and pleasant surprise, congrats on the single too.
Kinda disappointed I thought you would have done better. It's that damn garlic bread!
Hell ya with the badlands booker intro!
Should have added mustard!!! 😉 The breakfast items are better at MickeyDs’
Is it me or are teh big macs there way, way bigger than the ones they have in the US. Here they are tiny.
I will never not ever buy for myself or anyone else MCDONALDS!!!! Your food looks legit here in the states not so much and i swear they try to pass off other patties like quarter pounders and just give the basic patties instead never felt so ripped off in my life!!!!!!!!
Maybe u should have brought loads of the dips and mixed it up not sure how many they do but would be less dry and different flavour each time if u keep switching which dip u use
More cow bell !!!
He looks like the guy who's in love with the girl who loves garlic bread...
How is Badlands Chugs still alive? lol
Watching Beard's agonizing gluttony helps me stick to my diet. 😂
Gotta say these things are so wak. Rather they just made a bigger jucier pattie and put it inside
🧃🧃🧃🧃🧃🧃🧃
How is the new lockdown there ? How u guys are safe?
Hey mate you should do a challenge on the chicken selects those are so nice mate
Hey man I really like enjoy your videos keep up the awesome content!! Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to Everyone!!
Beard you always amaze me with the amount you can consume. I can eat maybe two. It’s always the guys that are half my weight that can show me up. Ha ha
Ryan in a coma I know it’s serious do you think that he’ll pulll through?
Happy Holidaze to ya Mr. and Mrs. Beard. I can't believe how catchy that tune is. Had to buy a couple few streams.
Adam Mate I Think Im In Love With Garlic Bread😉😁
I just associate Big Macs with a chemically, synthetic kinda taste 😫
Fuck I thought I was safe from that song a couple vids after.
McGirggles
After listening to the song 100 times, I'm starting to think the lyrics are "Garlic Breasts".  Maybe I'm hearing things?  :)
Who down votes this? Seriously??
Merry Christmas you guys from New Jersey...luv you guys !
BADLANDS YESSSSSS
This may surprise some people but I’ve never ever eaten a Big Mac before in my life! I’ve thought about trying it though
Merry Christmas Adam and Lindsay. best wishes for the  new year. And good job on the single, very catchy tune.
You should have had Mrs Beard sing back up on the song
meanwhile I love Big Macs...and Whoppers...I'm a philistine
I had one double Big Mac yesterday and was looking like you at the end of the video. 😂
Good going that, how was the aftermath? Good job on the single
I was singing “Garlic breath” (to the beat of your song) to my husband today. He totally digs raw garlic and ate A TON of it last night. I was laughing so hard. But since he didn’t get the reference, I looked slightly deranged! 😂
@BeardMeetsFood In the states here, we have a crap sandwich restaurant called Subway. I've always wondered if someone could eat more footlongs total then their own height. I think that's a new idea for a future video for you! PS Thanks for the entertainment.
Come on people download the song and that’s make it Christmas number 1
I downloaded the charity single and *🎵🎶 I think I’m in love with garlic bread!🎵🎶!* it’s pretty catchy I actually like it ☺️👍🏻👏🏻❤️🥖
Should see how many kfc gravy burgers you can eat
Would love to see you try the Greg Doucette 10000 calorie challenge for
I like your single.  Nice job
They are dry as fuck because theres like almoust no sause
6:42 when beard goes geordie like 🤣🤣
Badlands chugs actual goat
The festive series eating the least Christmasy foods possible 🤣
Just checked the i tunes charts and your smashing it like your big mac game  !!! New UK crimbo tune for ever more! Hahaha merry christmas beard and mrs beard
Don't be surprised if you get a stroke.
Beard i love the channel but I spent 8 hours in work today singing "Garlic Bread" it was a long 8 hours!! 😂😂
This is the best Christmas gift I could have hoped for. Thank you!
Was that Carmina Burana that misses Beard sang at 10:25mn ????
Merry Christmas, Beast!
Beard drink a coke so you can really burp love your channel and tell Mrs. B. I said 👋😁👍😁✌️😷
Wow you are literally a machine😂😂
Tune mate 80s vibe 👌
I found the video interesting until suddenly you both started shitting, it made video super disgusting
How much did you have to pay badlands to down load the number one stupidest Christmas song of the century
Canada has dbl big macs year round
Love 💖 the double big fart 💨 😂
Didn't chestnut eat 50 big macs
Nice ivan drago t-shirt man 👌
I think im in loooveeeee with the garlicc breadddd 💃💃💃
You're a fuc...g alien or a robot. I don't see any other solution :) Happy Holidays and tasty food :)
Everytime I listen to your song it always sounds like you're singing "I'm in love with a garlic bread"
Seeing Beard struggle makes you wonder... how in the Big Mac did joey eat 32?!?!  EDIT HOW IN THE DOUBLE BIG MAC DID MOLLY DO 34?!?!?
Just bought the jam!!! Great work beard and misses beard 🔥🤛🎄
🤣👍
Is the Woman your mum or your girlfriend ?
👍
She was nice. How did he get away with that. If I ever said that infront of a girlfriend it would start world war 3
Youtube music not featured
I love that Mrs. Beard is in more of your vids right now. Also, MAKE MORE MUSIC VIDEOS!!!!  It was the best thing I've seen in a really long time!
A "chug off" in Glasgow has a totally different meaning haha
Come on people! If you haven’t download this single yet there is something wrong with ya. Only 59p -69cents. All this for song that will linger longer than a  Brussels sprout trump.
Should do another unboxing vid. See what other random stuff people have sent you lol
Bought the single on iTunes. Love it 😂👌🏼
Anyone else notice street fighter in the background ?
That's immense one of em finishes me plus a cheese burger and I thought I could eat Jeeeezzz
4:49 you sound like a fart
Each burger has 4 pieces of meat, he ordered 16 burgers, which is 64 pieces of meat. At maccas, a typical tray holds 16. That poor guy on meat batch cooked 4 runs of meat for 1 order alone. I feel for you mate.
Damn, you're doing something good when the Legend, Badlands Chugs, is representing your stuff. People should sub to Badlands if you don't already
Why do you Ponytail your beard.
Was it not 50 hamburgers?
That’s a legit Drago shirt, beard. Where’d you get it?
What do you do with the leftover double big Macs that you don't eat??
Throwing up now 🤢🤮❗❗❗
Have you heard of mustard? Catsgut? Mayo?
That nose blowing and back door noise was just repulsive! 😂☘️
Mushroom burger challenge  😅😅😅
Awesome pal 👍 respect 🙌  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✌🥖🥖🥖🥖🥖🥖
Great job Beard downing all that shoe leather. McDumpies makes some of the worst beef patties ever 😂
was happily surprised to see my man BadLands in the beginning hahah
Most recent chart position: #15
That was Awesome! HOOAH!
Never heard of a double Big Mac
Omg I love Mrs. Beard's elf outfit! I have watched the YouTube garlic bread lol.
I've been watching for months but still can't tell what he yells at the start of the voiceover
Definitely thought I clicked on a Badlands Chugs video instead of this one and tripped me out at first! Lmao
Your shirt😂 what a coincidence,  I just watched Creed 2
Beard will eat a Big Mac again  In 2025
1.38 for first disappointed  lol
Love the T-shirt! I want one👍
I got some meat in my nose😂🇿🇦 also much love from south Africa
11th position now you’ll be wiping the floor with Mr Buble & Ms Carey 😂🤣
Merry Christmas Beard and Mrs Beard. You should sell a 7" mozza coloured record of Garlic Bread.
Badlands Biggin you up when we gonna see the big smoke
I just finished the last 5 a side of the year.  I HAD YOUR GARLIC BREAD SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD THE WHOLE GAME!?   to be fair we won and I actually scored ...
Is that you singing on the single?
I’m kinda surprised that you finished [redacted] of them. I was expecting more, then I realised my maths was off 😂
cant stop listening to the song... its so catchy
Geez Beard you're supposed to eat the meat not inhale it 😂😎
I can write music for you buddy , get in touch on my insta dazzacullen79
Felt like shit just eating one of those. Prey for a speedy recovery lol
I didn’t know Mickie Ds had double-Big Macs?? WTMF!
no 15 now
I both love and hate the name “goo rag”   It’s both very descriptive and very disgusting at the same time 😂
that face was classic gamble on a fart face
@beard where do you get your amazing selection of t shirts from?
Not a burger specialist.....Now Beard I wouldn't go so far as calling those things McDonald's Sells burgers 😂😁
What a beast.
Had to comment 666 Yeah they sit heavey
no way in hell dolphins are smarter than humans😂
7 bone prime rib with 5 quart ice pale salad and  sauce
Got the song repeat while I sleep every night try and get them streaming numbers up !!
Can you taste the meat? 🤔
Your single has been officially added to my car playlist on Spotify 👏
The Song stuck in my head
Your a beast Adam. Merry Christmas to you and your family.
Love this vid especially when ya missus says was it a gamble after you fart PMSL have a great Xmas both looking forward to next year's eating fun
badlands seems like the nicest dude
a mc Donalds milkshake would of sorted you out at the end
Dig the drago t shirt Adam 🥊👍
"I don't know what it is with McDonalds" - They remove the fibre from the buns! So yeah, not good for the 'rear end'....
First things first nice Christmas hat Mrs Beard . Now thanks for the Mon video. Great job as usual
Beard please go into an all you can eat buffet... a really posh one ☝️ and cain them
I wish I knew where he got that Drago t-shirt...
You did well on the single man, playing it on spotify atm. You play a lot of instruments! I just started electric guitar 3 weeks ago
Is it just my eyes or do those big macs look bigger than the ones in the U.S.   here if you ask for double they only put 1 patty extra on the burger.   Those look way bigger.  No wonder he's having a tuff go of it.
Keep the good work up!!!
Well done Beard that was a ot of double big macd I can't stand big macs either not sure what meat it is but it certainly does not taste like beef all the best mate love Lisa n Laura xxxxxxxx
It very nice bigger burger yum
Great video as always Beard man. Why do you never prepare coffee and or soft drinks before hand? Remember my comment for next time haha! Much love and happy Christmas to you and Mrs Beard!
Hello amber
They somehow made the big Mac worse by making it a double..bigger isn't always better..well that's what I tell my Mrs anyway.
Great job Beard! I'd may be able to eat 2. I live the arcade game behind you. Do you ever play it and if so who's your favorite character?
Double Big Mac is the best way of making Big Mac more palatable. The sauce is so vile that extra meat makes it more edible.
Appropriate T-shirt for eating far to much McDs...*deep Russian voice*  if he dies he dies...
Me son said 20 i called it at 12 and I was right. Still dont know where the triple cheeseburger challenge is. Good going beard.
Glorious song
Legend 👍💕
Just keep the other 2 within reach coz no matter how much McD's you eat, you'll be hungry again in an hour anyway 👍🍔🍔🍔🍔
Should of said if you get top 5 in the charts you will eat a bucket of brussell sprouts. incentives and that.
Another great video love me some double big mac's 😀😀😀
I want to be as cool as the beards when I grow up lol I just love the content!
I want to be as cool as the beards when I grow up lol I just love the content!
I bet a nice long nap was in order after this haha
McDonalds is hard to eat cause it always sits on your stomach like you have just choked down a lead car battery.  Stuff is meant for kids stomachs, not adults.
I'm not surprised you get new underwear at Christmas. You must go through quite a lot! 😉
2 left ! 2 left ?! Poor beard very poor xx
Two legends of the industry.... Beard and Badlandschugs. Would love to see a colab even if digital/streamed.
In answer to your question, yes yes I have downloaded the charity single!
The ability to eat so many Big Macs you no longer enjoy them should be the gatekeeper for competitive eaters
Bet you felt terrible after that
how about 50 dumplings and a gallon of gravy challenge
Bad land chug is a good person y’all could make a good team
Merry Xmas to you both mate. I remember the original Big Mac challenge very well !
Do a mega stuff Oreo challenge
Would love to see you eat an entire Christmas ham, or 2 or 3
You should try to find the biggest Christmas Cake you can get with the thickest icing on it.
Don't touch that beard 🙂
It's because McDonald's food is plastic 😂
He did 32 Big Macs 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
She looks like a festive gremlin 😂
come on!!!! 20 pounds of bacon!!!!!
Come on Mr. B....’shedded lettuce is surprisingly difficult to eat’ Eh!? Best not be losing your touch. Hopefully there’s a big 2021 in the pipeline.
💞💟😜👌💟💞💖
Iceberg lettuce is just the worst.  You should have been allowed a nice, dark leafy green as substitute.
I'm bored of a big Mac before I've finished one 🤣 Merry Christmas 😃
Next please: Double Triple Whopper
Mrs beard at the end 😂😂.... A fish finger challenge....
Man I only managed 1 with chicken nuggets and was full, it's a miracle how your body does it...Love the vids
dryer than ghandi's flip flop..mcdonalds is disgusting
Love you 2 , Your Awesome  Damn it !
Song downloaded. You are a legend
That was a result when you consider how much your body must have wanted to reject all that processed salty, Mucky D's before it even went in 😂 Here's Wishing You And Mrs.B A Very Merry Christmas
How does one get the double big mac in america? Is it like the MCgangbang, where it's not on the menu, but everyone knows what it is and they'll make it for u? We had the XL big mac for a while; kinda like the MCRIB. But that went the way of the dodo shortly after it came out.
You should try eating Jamaican foods
Should it not be I think I'm in love with the girl that likes a bit of garlic bread 🥪?
What’s going on in 2020 rich people are trying to see how much food they can eat well poor people are starving to death Enough food there to Feed five families
I think you do quite well with the creamy peas, maybe that's your specialty.
It’s the only sandwich at McDonald’s that doesn’t suck.
Downloaded ✅  Great song, great cause. Thanks for the entertaining  content week in week out. Merry Christmas.
Curious... when you’re clearly feeling discomfort like this video what’s the first move off camera? Lay down, sit down,  jump up and down?  I’d imagine vomiting that much isn’t healthy.  I know how I feel when I went back for thanksgiving 1 time too many and you look to be about 100 times that.  As always a great video.  Take care and happy holidays!  Cheers
You are playing Street Fighter...old school, nice!! (:
The first time I heard the song from other room and thought the words went "g*d is great" and was like "huh, Beard makes christian music now??"
Turns down back rub..... Lindsey must spoil ya. Nice!
Bro I love u but I can't stand to here u promote that damn song anymore
"Doesn't look like the adverts on TV."   Raphael Gomes made great videos about Food Hacks. How come food looks great on TV, but not in real life? in Raphael's video, secrets are revealed.
Thought Mr. BEARD archnemesis was remembering to make coffee
I usually ask them to sub out my shredded lettuce with whole lettuce. Makes it not as messy because half of it falls off .
Yayy badlands
I always personally considered kebab meat to be your arch nemesis 😂
Digging that shirt beard 👌🏻
Garlic Bread!  Got it!  I'll laugh everytime I listen to it ;o)
I enjoyed the format of not showing all of it until the end - builds suspense/disbelief and doesn't frame it as a win/loss... more like an endurance challenge. Nice!
How the fuck do you stay skinny,lol
You should eat an entire watermelon. Or 2
I’ll donate £20 to the stroke charity if you dye the beard white like Father Christmas!
Mad, mad props! I didn't think he could eat more than 10 especially after I saw Joey Chestnut eat 32 Regular Big Macs I knew no one could come close but I so proud of my Breaded Duder!
Downloaded the song and it's on my car driving playlist. Love it
You have heart to even do that 👍
Great vid beard, hope u have good Christmas!!
Who’s better . Joe chestnut or Molly Skyler ??
I'm still here beard I promise! Just been rough lately. Love the music haha so great
I’d be interested in a pre and post weigh in . See how much you increase.
You mad bastard: I say that with compliments
no holiday menu in the USA, :(
bro respect for eating the big mcs but im drawn to your street fighter 2 arcade game in the back groud i just wanted to smash a game of that all through the video lmao epic challage tho
Hey Adam you’re doing a big Mac challenge I hope you enjoy it that’s video you put out it’s such a catchy tune I can’t get it out of my head garlic bread it’s been in my mind but you did such an excellent job excellent job making that video that is so awesome Mrs. beard looks so cute with her glasses and you always look good enjoy your Big Macs😻😻😻😻👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍
Where do you get the Drago top from ?
Woah as of Monday 21/12/20 @ 21:30 your single is at No12 on iTunes Charts!! Wahoo go on bro!!
You should always get extra big Mac sauce.
Not NEARLY enough cheese on them burgers. So bloody dry,
That's exactly how dolphins eat.
Your song really catchy 💯👌🏾❤️
A seasick Steve song would have suited you better rather than Tiffany
Soooo... The biggest lobster roll ever eaten for new year video?
What makes them 'double?' I take the middle bread out of a normal big Mac already and still struggle . I hold my Santa hat up to you sir.
I could have done that many as meals with chips and Coke hahhahahaha nah well done m8 class love the vids
Lol I CAN'T get the song out my head garlic bread I love the fuxxing song .
Merry xmas mr and Mrs beard, lets hope 4 a better year next year!!! 👍
Maccas is hard to eat cause its dry as fuck
Where do i get one of those shirts?!
Most challenges make me think "I want to try that food".  Not try to beat the challenge, just eat some of the yummy food.  Not Maccas though.
I bet they are going to be well shocked when they see someone in a Christmas hat
Don’t know how to download the song:(
Is it just me or is Mrs Beard getting moist every time she flings him a BigMac? #Feeder
You should try chicken filled burgers challenge
Damn you got the chug king himself for your intro
MAN i have a real question. do you sleep in another room than mrs beard after you do this?
Correct me if I’m wrong (ion think I am) but did Adam eat 48 burgers in under 45 min??? ....damn 👀🤣😎
Is that a street fighter 2 arcade game in your mancave? I didn't think you could get any coole. BADASS
12 double big macs? If i ordered that my wife would call it an unhappy meal..
I think you need to fight a Big Mac Final Boss, like something Epic Meal Time Size
Beard, you need to make a video on Skittles.
Kept thinking he was saying Garlic Breath 😂😂😂
A friend of mine that weighed 387lbs ate 24 Big Mac's that we all pitched in and bought. We had a bet going between 30 of us. He ate them in 45 minutes. RIP Al. This was in 1986, he passed away in 2002. I lost $20.
pro tip - bbq sauce, hides the 'stale' taste of the beef / sauce combo after a while
You'll be farting till Christmas day with all that dude quarter pounders is the best way to go @ McDonalds you should have done that 👊
I don’t think that’s “meat”.
I wish all the competitive eaters and lad baby would do the christmas aid song for next year and give the money to the food bank chairty
think i'm the only one who took beard saying he'd love to do a chug off video with badlands the complete wrong way hahaha
Badlands chugs don’t touch that mouse!! Thought I had clicked on his video. Loving your videos and that song is way to catchy! I was also first to stream your song!
You did 12 and had 2 left so I think they only gave you 14...
Your treating us to another vid🥳🥳🥳
You will be so done with your Christmas song by the end of 2020 😂😂😂
I did 6 once!
Mrs beards gone full out for Christmas
You still ate more then I ever could, great job!
o ffs not again with the music lmao
Probably not the first time Lindsey has been asked to hold the “goo rag” hahaha
How much u 💩 when u do🙄🙄
I had this song in my head for the entire day
I think you could also be a musician
Shut up and eat your food 😂🤣 nobody wants to listen to a song about garlic bread  just eat your food 😂🤣 love your vids tho 😂🤣
i really like how's ur mom is in each video supporting you
As one wize man once said "I don't know why anyone would willingly eat sprouts" with wich I agree totaly I have one saying of my own:    Why would anyone willingly wanted to seeing mrs beard in videos or even prefer her... Sory to everyone ofended but she is sooooo annoying if you ask me
Im curious why they look so dry, whenever i order one in Germany it's basically flooded with sauce
Badlands, a tune and a big mac, if carlsberg did YouTube videos...
Hey dude your amazing
I love the streetfighter 2 arcade game in the background 😍 I want 1
If you did this with In N Out burger it would actually be more tasty and delightful. Bigmacs are gross & dry as you stated.
Every time I eat McDonalds I have the urge to go to the loo shortly afterwards. There's no way i could eat all of those without having to ruin the toilet half way through!
48 patties!
Cool to see Badlands in the intro.
I want to see another spicy challenge, when you feel up to it!
Miss beard sings better than you
Have u ever had a scan to see if u have an abnormal stomach lol
Everytime I'm eating while watching u I'm kinda in a contest myself to finish before sounds begin to escape if u know what I mean hahaha
What do you say in your catch phrase you shout and say quickly never undertand
I swear your voice overs vs you actually talking in the video are two different people 🤣
When you called Big Macs your arch nemesis, I was really hoping you’d call them your Golden Arches Nemesis... maybe next time!!
Number 1 for Christmas Garlic Bread, can’t stop singing it . Merry Christmas Mr and Mrs B.
Surely this is the last Big Mac variant they can do!? Might be able to knock Big Mac vids on the head after this!
Great video mate always love the channel. keep up the good work and happy xmas to you both and an awesome new year. cant wait to see what u bring to us in 2021..
You asked a question,  "WHY is Mickey D's food was so difficult to eat?" Dude, it's synthetic!
Ohhhh you gonna slaughter the bowl tomorrow...
Was there any need for you to be so entertaining and then make the catchiest tune I’ve ever heard. Too much man haha. Love it
Mrs Beard taking on Timmy Mallett with those specs
So aside from helping getting things down, doesn't the water fill him a lot after 3 or 4 glasses?
Nothing says Xmas like garlic bread & Mackies but can we have some chocolate assortments and mince pies ;)
He ate 12 and I counted two left. Where did 16 come from. 😶  Also already downloaded the song. So merry Christmas Mr and Mrs. Beard
That song is terribly AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never thought you'd go back to the big mac lol
Pretty sure I saw you in castleford today?
Tomato sauce might helped
Drago
Beard I think I’m in love with Garlic Bread 😂🤘🏻
Loved this video. Funny and very entertaining. I do love the song. Good job in that great song. A good tribute for Mrs.Beard. Good challenge as well👍🎄❄️
Your songs stuck in my bloody head now , yet again your a animal , good effort mate that looked painful towards the end
Love how street fighter is in the background lol
Lettuce in a burger should be banned.
If you dropped some hot bars on a Christmas album next year... I'd look under the "Wrap" genre.
"that's how dolphins eat right?" yea, dolphins are well known for eating well processed dry arse food like double big macs, that's exactly why they are shaped how they are.....
Love this song! Good job beard
Christmas kicked in.
You won't braid your hair into your beard though
Where do you get all your T-shirt’s and jumpers from Beard love em.....downloaded single too
This is impressive, I can barely finish a normal bigmac and fries 😅
No way can’t unsee it now ... your mum looks just like the Krankies 80’s kids show 🤣
You ate 12 burgers and have 2 left that makes 14 not 16
Beard you’ve got do a challenge with the Asda giant eclair
Merry Christmas to you both, much love :)
David Attenborough - "And here we see the majestic dolphin, eating wild cheeseburgers as we've all seen before. Nose in the air, beard down, forcing the meat into its mouth."
Beard, tell me about your singing...about your record.  Do you sing for money? Did you do all the mixing? That IS you playing all the music, yeah?
Is that girl his wife? She’s in every video
You want to dislodge food from the nasal cavity? Tilt your head back and open your mouth....I swear! Lol. Wicked vid as always, Beard!
your christmas single is on my facebook page
Hi Beard, me and my boyfriend love your channel! You and Mrs beard seem like a really nice people, such warm personalities. Keep up the good work!
Number 23 as I'm making this comment!! Keep up the great work. I think these burgers count as 2.5, so really you ate 30 in my book!! LET'S GET IT!!!!
I enjoyed it.
I totally understand why you “think you’re in love with the girl who likes garlic bread” - she’s very loveable. You both are🥰
32 Big Macs was the record, so that’s why you had 16
Can you taste the meat? Hahhaaaaaaa
McDonald's Patties.are shite burger king much nicer
Get a side of MacSauce and dip, it'll just slide down
Beard stick to munching bro. That tune is more cheese then you’ve ever eaten.
4:50 my morning fart
Anyone waiting for a big old swear to come thundering from the mouth of Mr Beard?
Adam, now we waiting for entire CD! Single will not be enough🤣 nice video man! We love bonus video❤
quite like bigmacs, are maccies is good over in UK but USA all the food is full of extra crap, i mean they add chems to make the fries yellow.
Merry Christmas to you both, good luck with the song 😊
Leave no doubt 😅
Love the t shirt nice homage to rocky franchise if he dies he dies 🥊🤣
I can't download the song. Im in the UK. Help...
Molly done 32 big macs. You're a beginner
Garlic Bread is Stuck in my Head 😂 ps it's brill 🎅
Man i challenge you to post uncut or edited video or i call you cheat

Dolphins are definitely more intelligent. How often do you see them queuing at mcds?
Your song has been stuck in my head since I heard it, love it 😁 its downloaded in my spotify list
Well done Adam. Love the content and the single. Happy Christmas to you and Mrs beard. It kills me when you start getting full and the groaning and eye rolling starts.
It’s just sooo dry.
Yep I downloaded it. Have a great Christmas ya hairy bugger. Feast on.
beard is slowly turning into a star... and i mean literally turning into a star with his beard.
Bonus BMF video. Best present ever!! 🎁😉
i had a double bacon cheese from burger king today, pretended i was doing a video ha ha ha dont forget Burns night and Tunnocks !!!!! tim from Hull
Do you not have McRib sandwiches this time of year in the UK? I think you'd crush 25 of those!
Yep McDonald's and subway your nemesis
I haven't had a Big Mac in ages....so after seeing this, i promptly went out and got 2 doubles Macs, a medium fries and coke....and im spent. Beard?....i dont know how you do it. lol
A bread pudding or English Figgy pudding for the holidays  for a treat for you or just rest. Have a great Holiday you and Mrs. Beard.Stay safe .
Great video beard! What is the aftermath of food challenges? Is it true competitive eaters have to puke after? Not sure if thats a question that you’re even allowed to answer. Either way merry christmas beard!
Chugs with the plugs 🔌
Downloaded the Christmas single loving it. Keep humming and singing it very catchy well done Adam x
I love the references to Randy 🤣
Love the way Lindsay was lobbing burgers at you... well done.  I'm not a fan of fast food but the ads made me want one of these but seeing as you said they're not as good as the ads, I won't bother.  Merry Christmas to you both xx
Shitting bricks tomorrow.
Awesome
If you are 12 and there are two left, they only gave you 14, not 16?
Well done see you on the next one 🍔🍔👊
Your kinda gross but alot awesome....
watch lad baby
Never seen a more dry burger 🤣
Just please don’t get a heart attack!
Badlands Booker ! You have made it. 😘🇨🇦
Meat in your nose is better than meat in your....
I’ve found a cure for depression- it’s this channel! 💙
You need to customise these extra mac sauce it's free
Even if you didn't eat all of the DBM's that you bought, you still made a damned impressive effort! (Let's have a moment of silence for your poor toilet in the aftermath of this video!...especially if Mrs. Beard kept squeezing your belly! LOL!)
I would love to see how many double 1/4 pounders you could eat merry Christmas and a happy new year Mr and Mrs beard
Best song of the year!! Downloaded... let’s get beard No1!!! Let’s get it!!! Beard army! X have a great Christmas 🎄
This mans song better then these SoundCloud rappers and some main stream rappers and it’s just his first single
Nice 36:14 🍌🍌🍌🍌
Merry Christmas to Mr. and Mrs Beard, the extended Beard family and everyone watching the video!! Many blessings in the New Year!!✨🎄
STREET FIGHTER 2 IN THE BACK GROUND , LEGEND
I expect to see a whole range of garlic bread merchandise soon
Oh no i felt for you doing this one esp after last time. you brave warrior. you rock. thank you for the smiles and the garlic bread.
Can’t even understand what you are saying in the “Christmas” single
10:55 When Mrs beard asks "was that a gamble?" I think we all know what she really meant.
You did well mate keep up the good work
Very well done  that looked really hard. Loved your hats.
Arch nemesis? Beard perhaps a new years resolution is in order not to lie to your viewers.  We all know you still check under your bed for the giant toblerone every night. ;=)
Just downloaded Garlic Bread!
You said you wouldn’t do it
32 Not 30
They look suuuuper dry. I hate Bic Macs really really bad
Have you ever streamed a challenge? I.e. live ... obviously.
Mrs Beard smashed the christmas hat and glasses look.....eating the dry double macs came a clse 2nd, they certainly need more mac sauce on them.
5:25 blows a snot rocket in his house then apologizes for it being disgusting. Don’t apologize to me! Apologize to the carpet dude! Hahaha
meat in the nose... that feeling... I think a lot of us knows that :D
McRib challenge so it’s moist and goes down easier
Hey, I have a Samsung phone and only have standard free Spotify, is there any way I can purchase it through google play store, or how else can I purchase it for Android phone?
Could you try the Cool Hand Luke 50 boiled egg challenge?
Double mammoth 🦣 🍔🙌🤪
12 double big macs in one sitting. Beard, You're more a man than I will ever be!
Garlic bread💃💃💃💃💃💃
Me when I finally found the guts to wave at my crush and she ignores me: 1:51
I've always found the bm to be dry
BADLANDS CHUGS
What's with all the cuts between burgers! Seems sus or just godawful editing?
I’ve got the garlic bread song on repeat in my head!
Gonna be sick after that
Yessssss 👊
Have you done the steak challenge at: Jacks American Bar & Grill Oldham??
Big Macs are pootang. Double quarter with cheese is where it’s at!
Mrs Beard's costume.......Elf-ton John?
How many Chinese dumplings van you eat
Thanks for the video, appreciate those Big Macs shaves years off your life lol. How Chestnut done over 30 and a puddle of sweet lol
Creme eggs are back in shops? Many you think is achievable bro? 50 in a box I reckon over 100 before you start to feel dirty 😜
had two double big macs the other day, two reasons why i dont eat maccies anymore apart from that time as i woke up late for work and just eat was a quick solution. they were so fucking dry and tasteless. great video as always beard
so practically it is double double burger... what a concept eh? instead of making it wider to accommodate their large patties they just add more patties into existing one.  Anyways i was looking for big beard's revange on big mac, did not expect it to be bigger big mack but than again i never even heard of double burgers from them so might be they dont make them here.
Follow through
Why do i have a craving for  big mac's after watching this ?
Merry Christmas Guys xx
big macs are your arch nemesis, or should you say....golden arch nemesis!
Oh yeah. Do you love me? 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Next challenge,. I dunno if y'all got them across the pond or not. Mcdoubles. Get those minus ketchup and mustard, add big Mac sauce and shredded lettuce. They're big Macs at over half the price
I just finished watching your last video and here is another
Always go for extra souce in those mate
My astonishment to see a Monday video does not outweigh my happiness, the holidays are truly a time of giving.
Ok ok I'll stream the song. It's grown on me so much now!!
No matter what I accomplish in life, when I'm questioning if it's not only done but done well, I ask myself, "is it 'Randy clean?'"  Hasn't failed me yet.
Beard the way I look at it anything on the Mickey D’s Menu is better with Big Mac Sauce.
That song is trash, but love the personality in it.
My ears feel like crying. But it's for charity, which makes me a bad person. Feels bad...
6:20 - how smooth was that burger slide by the Mrs.
Early Marry Christmas everyone
Fcuking delish
Love that you have the street fighter 2 game in the background. N I cant stand McDonald's food. So good for you eating it. Love your videos bro
I'm making garlic bread, listening to Morrissey and Adam while dreaming of big macs, mushrooms and sprouts.
Making Beard Fois Grois..😂😂😂😑
Garlic bread I think I'm in love  garlic bread I think I'm in love 🤣
I'm sorry but when you say poutine beard it sounds so much like like beat stoney in the putang eating contest
If he dies, he dies
Im pretty sure thats how seaguls eat.
Holy Toledo.  WE LOVE YOU here in Ohio!!
I never even heard of a double Big Mac😳
next is Chestnut's Big Mac record... you are welcome...32
Serious question: does eating these kind of  foods, like this and the bread, give you constipation??? :/
I was yelling at the screen “Stop Beard stop”!!!!!! After the twelfth one,ha!! I could tell it was just the human limit, Those double burgers are heavy man!! 🍔 we want you around to eat another day❣️ That song is taking over🎼 🥁awesome🥰
Hopefully these Big Macs won't give you a tapeworm.
The bearded one takes on his nemesis the mightily. Big Mac, I have the  faith in the bearded one, may the force of your jaw be with you
yyyyyyaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy Mrs Beard
Garlic bread!! Instant classic adding this into my karaoke repertoire
AYYYYYY!!!! Badlands!!!! 🤘🔥🍻🍻🍻
3 more burgers come on...
Downloading now and once again hats off thats was hard to sit through. But hey you literally just did all that bread so though I absolutely LOVED 2 vids in 24 hrs it didnt help in any way. I hope you keep using Mrs Beard for delivery that was great! Merry Christmas to you both.
I think i could do 4 double big macs. Haha
Downloaded bro my kids love it! it’s great I always do the Peter Kay “GARLIC BREAD “so when we heard the tune we fell about with enjoyment and laughter brilliant the talking beard brilliant !!!!!!!!
You could do a "Santa's milk and cookies" challenge. Or else eat a lot of reindeer jerky.
That Drago shirt is awesome, knowing your past struggle with the burger. Best quotes from Yvan Drago:  ''You will lose'' ''I cannot be defeated'' ''I fight to win, for me. For ME!''  the scariest : ''If he dies, he dies''.
MacDonald's = Disgusting however Multiple Double Big Macs = IMPRESSIVE...
Was that a gamble? She's really funny lol
Good time of year to gamble 🤣😂😂🤣
Meatnose is not exactly a nickname I'd want to be stuck with. 🙄😒😳😁😃🤣🤣🤣 (I'll give you a big 👍for taking down a dozen of those puppies.)
If I was working at the McDonald’s you ordered from I’d cry
How many pig in blankets do you reckon you could eat in 40 mins? Maybe this could be a good challenge! Have a great Christmas 🎄
Garlic bread garlic bread I think love in love garlic bread
Your an animal beardy ✊👊
Come on thats got to be some kind of record. Right? 13:43 in 12 damn double Big Macs and yes Mrs Beard I agree thats like 24. The meat is the meat after all
Meat in the nose is never fun, ask Randy's mom.  (soz Randy).
Wtf. I'm American and I've never heard of a double big mac.
Never heard of a double big mac 😲
The pain on your face 😂
I’ve been watching you from quite some time now but you never really try out different cuisines much i mean like mexican or something. Is it because of the jalapeños?
Snorting that meat down... You trooper 😂
👍🏻🥃❤️
I had a double big mac today.. & it was pitiful!! Well done on eating 12 though 😅👍
These are as nice as a maccies burger gets. What a legend haha. I had double big mac meal and a wrap of tne day n I struggled to finish it. Legend Mr and Mrs beard seasons greetings
Its the amount of sodium that shuts you down
THAT BADLANDS INTRO  Gassed me!!!!!!!!! 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️😰😂😂😂
How’s the song getting on??
Big Macs are awful, I describe them as watery burgers.. as in all the flavours are watered down and completely lacking. The  Big Mac sauce used to be so much better.
Thanks for putting me in the video haha. Pleasure to meet you again! Gutted I forgot to ask for a picture with you and lindsay 😂🤦‍♀️
I used to work at Muccci D's and the surf and turf (big mac and fillet combo) is the nicest combo...
I am far from a competitive eater. But one time I had four double big macs. Felt like crap, won't do that again.
We don't have doubles here, and i don't even remember if they were ever rolled out in my area
Just bought the song buddy..!!.. It’s gonna be stuck in my head all Xmas..!!..😁😁👍🏼👍🏼
makes me think about ordering 20 big macs and seeing if I can do this.   Then I remember its maccas and I am like pass
It's all about The Garlic Bread in 2020
Needs more thigh...
They definitely do not say dolphins are smarter than humans..
Tried one, burgers were dry and sauce was too much. But I have to say need a dose of the Garlic bread song on a daily basis 😊👍👍
Love mrs beards hat! Where did she get it from?
I must break you
I haven’t had McDonalds since I was 15...  I’m 33 now, zero desire to ever go near it. I’ll let you make up for me !
If you have the crib over there, try to eat as many of them for newyears!!!
There was a time in my life when I could have ate this guy into oblivion. Thank goodness those days are behind me. 😩
'some assembly required' lol
Didn’t expect you to ever do another Big Mac related challenge, honestly. Still, great job. I can’t stand big Mac’s personally. I’ve not had one in years.
That hurt watching it...I do not like macci's one little bit...good try...Lindsey dancing was hilarious!!!
"Sorry that was kinda disgusting" Don't worry about it mate, we're used to it & I think Mrs B definitely is😂 I'm pretty impressed though, you did a solid amount that no 'normal' folk could've done in a single sitting, so 👏🏻
I’d rather eat a used cat litter stotty. You deserve a medal for bravery. 🤢
i pretended to eat my burgers as if i was in a competition - i ate 3 burgers
Dammit Beard, I'd just got the song outta my head! Jokes, love it mate! Got the siblings playing it too
Mrs Beard just droppin them in is awesomeness lmao!! Friggin love your videos my brother.
You make great content but that song isn't for me
Love the vids
Great video Adam hope you both have a great xmas
Randy clean. Lol.
great job adam you are still a beast
Shame on you beard this song is too Good!! Bro been streaming none stop! Love from Jamaica ✌🏿 Big up Mrs. Beard
It doesn't matter how much McDonald's you eat, the resulting McTummy is inevitable.
I think im love with garlic bread
Im 7:43 in. All I can say is you are the Don my friend. My stomach hurts for you. Bet that totally made you feel better, NOT haha.
your tune is similar to blossoms or something along that line .
Hope we can see more collabs in 2021 and you rocking the Nathan's and become number 1
Congrats on completing 12 🍔 Hope your single goes in the top 5 🙏🏼 #GreatVideo #GreatSong #GreatVocals  👏🏼👏🏼💯 Wishing you both Adam & Lynsey a merry Crimbo 🎄😃💯
Merry Christmas Mr & Mrs Beard! Enjoy the festivities
"i shouldve asked to badlands to rap on the song! oh well next year"   theres always a chance of a remix ;)
Luv the garlic bread tune...betta than the original 😅😅
Oh man! Great video as usual. The gamble bit had me in stitches!!
You should make a giant Big Mac
A chug off video! Make sure you get that one up on the hub as well.
Bet u can’t eat a box of weatabix plain with no liquid until after u ate them
Wow! Monday upload- was not expecting this! Looks like you enjoy Big Macs nearly as much as Garlic Bread! Xmas 2021 song "Big Macs (I think I love you)"
Oh n merry Christmas guys
Mr n Mrs beard r legends........ Garlic bread wot a tune lol hope its a success
Adam you bought at least 4 bags of big macs. I do not know how many per bag.
TBH MCDONALD'S burgers are dry and it is hard to bite tho
LETS GET ITTTTT
Last Christmas, i gave you my heart.... thats shit!!!  Iam in love with the garlic bread is the best song in this time ♥
how have i gone from hating your single with a passion to randomly singing it every time i hear it hahahaha its gotta make it in the top 40 now!!!!!
you might have failed the first challenge, but the signature tune was better
Get a water dispenser in there and start doing the videos in there its visually much better than the kitchen
Have a McChristmas
It’s my boi Badlands!!!!
Do you get any issues with Salt mate?  Surely you are consuming huge amounts there - I appreciate the calorie thing and fasting for the week but that is one huge hit on Salt...
Ooh la la
That shirt, Drago ... reminds me of Rocky. "I cannot be defeated .... if he dies, he dies".
those look like they are as dry as sand ! hahah well done , keep working on that winter body ;)
I love you Beard but I'm still mad at you that I have the garlic bread song stuck in my head!! 🤨
A Christmas song about garlic bread? I always knock on Christmas music because there hasn't been anything original in a jillion years, but I guess you, sir, have proven me wrong. Also, is a double Big Mac a secret menu thing, or a regional thing, or something else? They don't seem to be available where I live, at least not according to the website.
It has been downloaded mate 😄👏👍🍺☃️🎄
Hats off to ya for doing yet another food challenge. You may just be needing a flush assist toilet for Xmas haha
come on, your arch nemesis is brussel sprouts. you dislike big mac's
I'm surprised McDonalds don't refuse to serve Mr beard, the amount of slagging off he does of there food.
It was a while since you've done MRE. What kind of army is a BeardArmy without its own MRE ? Let me guess, it woud be done by FiveGuys, wouldn't it ? Actually, that wouldn't be such bad idea. One gargantuan burger model with milkshake to go could be marked as MRE of The Beard Army...
Yes Adam 9:40 I was thinking they get too dry, and that's a normal. I would have had a carton of ketchup for each. EDIT: I'm just looking at  at Maccy D's app for the perfect looking double BigMac, Only one slice of plastic cheese for the whole burger? That's a bit shit!!
These are one of the messiest foods I’ve had
Get beard 2 mill by Easter
Great video!
Have a great Christmas
Not a legit “Christmas/Seasonal “ in the festive fast food video but impressive enough to eat the most ever in the same Christmas video series?  Edit: And still salty about how much GB Mrs B ate?
ffs Beard, now i want big mac's :D
Stay safe bro and love your videos😄
Fair play for even eating one of those vile things. Only surpassed in nastiness by maccies breakfast platter.
Look at that beautiful Elf on a Shelf aka mrs. Beard
I love Big Macs but not this much 😳😩😂
I love you
Merry Christmas Luv ya guys
only 3 mins in and i like the twist adam merry xmas mate
whats the backstory with you and Big Mac's xD
Garlic bread!?... Garlic bread!? 🤨 it’s the future I’ve tasted it 🤪
Monday? Beard, it's Monday. Have you fled the UK because of the mutated COVID? I hope all is well. I'm commenting before watching so I'm sure it's gonna be great.  I have that Garlic bread hook in my mind!! Damn you.
Omg a monday upload from adam what's wrong with you
To think I asked this of him on Twitter in November and got a hell naw reply - damn filthy liar!   I am ready to enjoy this.
That damn "Garlic Bread" has gone in my head constantly today. Thank you very much, Beard- 😂
I’ve done 5 with double cheese. Double cheese makes them better, but the grand Big Mac is way better. Well done beard, and merry Christmas, you’re awesome. x
Have a rest
Yummm big mac my fav i wonder have u done a mc rib sandwich challenge heheh Mary Christmas to u amd beard family 🤗🤗🤗🤗🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Garlic Bread 🎼💃🎼💃 la la la Garlic Bread 🥖
Love you 💋💋😘😘❤️💯
If you get in xmas top 10, time to give Mrs Beard dat baby...
I cant wait for you to be able to go back to America missed the American mini series but when you do go back, can you please go to New Orleans and do the pancake challenge again as a guy called Joel Hansen took your record the other day and yeah I work at maccies I told them this aint very festive🙄
Should do the kfc gravy burger adam👍

Since listening to the song, I’ve been craving garlic bread. Finally, I had garlic grilled cheese sandwich. Looks like I need to buy your song, Beard. ❤️ Mrs. Beard, you look lovely as ever! ❤️
Who else thinks McDonald’s is absolutely rank food? Seriously I don’t know if my tastebuds have changed with age, but I had a Big Mac meal the other day and through desperation, & it was absolutely tasteless🤢🤮
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩Beard💗💗Stay Safe
Awe fuck yeahhhhh
Why have I never realised he had long hair
Just when I thought this Monday would swallow me up....BEARD is here to save the day
oh jeez rather you than me ahaha!
Mcdonalds are self harm..
Beardingtons Beardsley army. Gran daddy mac
Gonna order a maccies before the end of this video.
You’re my “fast food hero”

Damn this is the earliest I have been on any video on YT
Mmmm. Was just thinking about a double big Mac

Oooh yeeees!
#garlicbread
Yasssssssss
3rd 😀😅 Smash it Beard 👋💪👍
Super early wow
IM EAAAAAAAAAAAARLY
DOWNLOAD THE CHRISTMAS SINGLE HERE: https://bit.ly/38lO2d5  I hate to bang on about it, but I’m not sure i’ll ever be able to knock together a song as good as this ever again, so I’d hate to miss the opportunity to do something good in an otherwise pretty grim year. Again, any profits made from streams/downloads this month I’ll be donating to Stroke Association, which really is a great cause. So if you’ve a spare 59p to download the track it would mean the world to me.  Thanks for an out of schedule Monday night upload. I hope you enjoy it. Yes, eating like this two days in a row is a bad idea. Yes, I’m going to gain weight this month. Yes, I’ll lose sight of my abs. No, it’s not the end of the world…it’s Christmas after all! I hope you’re having as merry a season as possible in present circumstances and I’d be over the moon to see you again for the next video! :)
