Time flies
Who’s watching this 2024-2025 😂
This aged well
Still no first person mode 😔
People in c5 s4👇🏾
And there was no memorial reveal at the end of the
0 comments in a month I’ll change that
i know what is coming in chapter5 boss and medallion and a new map and hope will be in the battle pass and the season theme is called underground and there will also be trains this season and also a lego mode and a
After ch5, Fortnite went downhill from there
They only got one name right💀💀
Lame
8:07 😢
4:15 no No Yes Yes
It's crazy how so much of this is wrong
I am from the future and I am in chapter 5😮
I missed it. I’m pissed.
That new sniper rifle be so smooth literally smoked 6 or 7 people in like 30 seconds or less 😂
ME
In my opinion, the Wolverine claws weren't added because of the return of Wolverine, but instead the entrance of the Shredder who may arrive with the Ninja Turtles! Just a theory though.
I missed the event becaus eit put me on wue for almost an hour.
"Hiding in plain sight" that's what the illuminati do. And seeing how the antagonist's logo in chapter 5 is an all seeing eye. And they call themselrves the (secret) "society". Either it's a joke or not. I don't think it's a joke. Don't underestimate this conspiracy or else you will fall into whatever trap they have laid out.
God dam😮
As a rocket league pro I see this as an absolute win 🗿🗿🗿
Is anyone getting look at me XXXTENTACION?
Like mine if Ur gonna miss og
Me  thxs tg5
Am I the only one that saw lightning McQueen at 7:09?
well this was accurate
I’ve been waiting for a Fortnite x Doctor Who collab for years and it looks like the day has finally come 🥲
Dude if they added trains if you high jack it you have to get a mythical weapon
Me
Any just forget the sports
so lego Save The Wrorld
The new Lego stuff actually sounds super cool
Bro took dat footage from Lego Worlds lol
4 1/2 hour queue
Let’s just ignore the queue
💯
Another L for the OGs
Nahh the woman is gwen stacy right?
Wonder if our skins will be able to be used in Lego or whether they're going to have us use vbucks to buy skins we already have
Das crazy
Ngl ik this isn’t old OLD.. fortnite but I miss the boss locations like the authority and I miss the animals you can train
How lame, Let's take a fun game and make it Hollywierded. If I want to play Guitar hero, I will just play it. I do not want it in my other games I actually like. Boring, guess I may be done with Fortnight for a while, if not forever.
Unpopular opinion but I love all of these changes
Maybe
Bro me personally i dont like the chapter 5
Am I the only one who noticed that the “random skin” looks like Gwen Stacy from the spider verse
The agency is coming back..
Dude epic is literally insane. All of this stuff for one update then you have destiny 2 that adds one micro-transaction armor set and fires half their staff
Chapter five : copying COD (even more)
Jbuck here, I need help finding Jeff Smitty Mayo.
This is the least excited I've ever been for a fortnight season kinda disappointing tbh
Tbh i dont know how im gonna feel abt this boys
Fortnite stw players here all this instead of them adding it to stw💀💀💀💀💀
BRO MY FAV RAPPER IS EMINEM
Lego Sheldon in battle pass
let’s be honest since we got OG fortnite now, we need chapter 2 fortnite. Chapter 2 was my favorite
0:56 thats a bass not a guitar
Don’t add garbage crossover mythic weapons in ranked. Pubs is fine
WHY WAS THIS SEASON SO SHORT?!!??!!?!?!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭    I'M ONLY LEVEL 1... I'M GONNA HAVE TO GRIND FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Im a Big fan PlutoV2
it should be juice wrld tomarow is juice wrlds birthday
fortnite should acc just focus on br mode and not do anything else like these Minecraft type mode which might just make the game die or make it very very boring as they pay less attention to the main mode BR
Me watching this after getting all the eminem stuff
Why add anvil launchers back instead of the guided missiles ?
so fortnite is now turning to call of duty, Minecraft, and rocket league, & roblox. nice....
Who’s gonna miss the OG season
Fortnite just need to keep it simple that what we all want and like
Honestly I really think this is just gonna ruin the game it seems like it’s just too much and they’re branching out too far instead of just focusing on what the original game was
There better be the lego skin
Miss
I will mid fn
They probably put Wolverine's claws back in the game for Deadpool 3 hype-up.
Bro turned into rust
nobody asked for any of this
Might as well just make other games atp 😭🙏
Masters of the Universe…… bring it Epic!
I’ll just stick to project diva
I have a feeling fortnite is gonna buy everything and eventually make fortnite like the oasis
On one mountain off map is a glowing light, there is rumor that is the cube queen. Does anyone know anything about it. (Tallest off sim/map mountain, 1/4 down to left side).
help in  need skins
bro there doing way too much
5:15 Now we know why there has been bo live events because they had no time to work on them
As long as they keep an OG gamemode
So Fortnite will go back to its shitty self before the OG season and just be a sweatier version of COD MW
Lego skin goes hard
NOOOOOOOOOO
It’s gonna suck that we aren’t gonna be able to play chapter 1 again😭 huge part of a few years and it’ll be gone for good
Smell alot of nerfs coming this is gonna be overpowered in some way like always rip to the OG's. Og player Wicked-_-Jr PS5
they really really need to do SOMETHING good with save the world….
The claws are being updated early for the Deadpool movie coming out next summer
Fortnite is gearing up to be BIGGEST thing to hit the game world
Considering no one liked all the major fortnite changes in chapter 2 like animals I think it's gonna go back to being to much to handle and start to fall apart again. Why can't it just be simple 😢
Seems like they’re focusing on everything BUT battle royale
man epic games is trying to make fortnite like roblox, them focusing and encouraging new game modes and custom game modes, the filtering of skins weapons and such, listening in and recording your voice calls and mics during games. seems a tad over kill. fortnite has defiantly changed for the worse since chapter 1 season 1 and by the looks of next chapter seems to be even worse than the current.
I am actually excited for this new season. I enjoyed the nostalgia from this OG season but I like the ever so evolving seasons.
This is going to suck.
Could you Top5Gaming film the event for me and my friends we have a basketball game at the time of the,event
I might get a little hate on on me but not me
Just give me 1 more day.
Weapon attachments 🤬🤬 NO NO NO NO! if you want all of that go and play COD! Weapon simplicity is what makes Fortnite so accessible to all 😀
If this happens to Fornite I might quit
Im not finna play Fortnite after the og season
No way Fortnite gets a racing mode before rocket league
Maybe Lego will also come out with Fortnite Lego sets.
i bet fortnite is doing a lot just not to lose almost everyone after the chapter 1 map will be gone
Am I the only one that thinks this is ruining the Fortnite community
We want One Piece
ngl i’m a old head type of music listener so i’m going to enjoy playing Toto- Africa as a performer i love that song ❤
I got to like 12 and was like “they’re adding too much now”. Ok, lego is cool but it’s not Fortnite. Racing is cool but it’s not Fortnite. Music…   Battle Royale was in and of itself a game mode but it’s what most came for. It IS Fortnite. This is too much, too late. I like the idea of the open world, but I would prefer OG any day. So they SHOULD keep it playable.
RIP Fortnite “BATTLE ROYAL”
Wolverine claws probably added for dead pool 3 release
what about OG :(
this doesnt really matter but: the rocket league  season ends on dec 2 so wonder what will happen there 👀
Hello the Lego will be like Gotham city you can’t build in one area it will just be a landing place
All I want is Fortnite to have a better matchmaking system. Because I get into a duo or trio and everybody editing like Mongraal. And I know damn well I’m not that good😂
I wish Fortnite damn near would keep the og map as an optional map to play on smh
keep the og map as a game mode    who agrees   👇
Me
Dear Google bring fortnite back on the app store.
Bro Apollo and Olympus I’ve been reading the Percy Jackson books like crazy and now every time somebody says something like that, I get hyped
uninstalled.
Bro, if they add a guitar rhythm game into Fortnite, the hardest songs to play are paint it Black,people are strange and ,creep and I love those songs and my father is a musician, so I would really like it if they added that
No one talking about the chicken guitar and microphone, fnaf. 0:55
Ima miss og fortnite but lwk that Lego collab sound fire asf
Could you please gift me the slim shady skin I don’t have money for it @CedarJungle8801
so its lego stw
My birthday is December 7
I only clicked because I saw a Lego minifigure
Am I the only one who is extremely overwhelmed by all this and finds it too much?
Surely the big surprise is that they are gonna keep OG Fortnite as a game mode
Tommy, please correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t there a week saying that everyone who tuned into the event will get an exclusive Eminem skin
the og season literally just feels better… im not even og but its the closest thing to ch2 and im satisfied kibda wish it was longer
I have a question if anyone can help me? If fn is making so much money with going back to the og game, then why are they changing it? Like “dont fix what aint broke”
It looks like I'm not playing Chapter 5 as I'm not a 12 year-old. No interest in restricted skins and lego everything
I listened to the spoilers cause I will be at a 2 day basketball tournament so I’m sadlol 😂
that’s a bass not a guitar
That’s Gwen Stacy
That's a bass
hot take: nobody wants to get rid of this og map
Yea let’s go
Thanks bro
i only excited for the doctor who crossover
Dude… they are going HAM on this game. To think they only made save the world and got no attention when they had this much drive and above average planning and all it took was battle Royale getting popular for Epic to put their Epic spin on it, now they have THEE most popular game and have the youth, and adults in their hands.
the PS4 players won't be able to update the game 💀💀💀💀💀
I'm gonna miss  OG
Not me
We are getting Minecraft in Fortnite before GTA 6
If you logg into fortnite again and it asks you with what you want to logg in It also gives you the option LEGO
they should keep OG fort
As much as ill miss season og, chapter 5 looks promising but you never know, Epic could screw chapter 5 up but again, you just never know
fortnite is collabing so much in on event idk how ima keep up
Me
It’s crazy nobody is talking about the Fortnite trailer with juice wrld skin in it. JUICE IS COMING GUYS
I started playing Fortnite last year, holy hell.
Wow... I can't wait for the Kenny G collab. Maybe a Backstreet Boys collab...  Who else was popular late 90's or early 2000's?  Not like it's 2023...
Me
I just realised . If we stop the black whole chapter 2 , chapter 3 and chapter 4 will never happen and it will erase that whole storyline 🫨😢
New map looks awful way too big
Can you give me a shout out in your      video at 8 in the after noon .
Can you give me a shout out in your      video at 8 in the after noon .
Let me guess in chapter 6 they're going to bring chapter 3 back
I miss chapter 4 it's the best season
Dude it just came back why are they taking it away, Im leaving for another 5 years I guess
Maaan iphone cant relate
The next season better be the longest season because it sounds great
if the lego mode is perm and it stays and its a survival mode i would 100000000000% play fortnite i just hate BR its sooo damn boring and full of sweats i love the PVE content
Its more like lego worlds honestly
Is that a jojo reference
Doctor Who, emenem, and a Lego??
no thanks all this just seems too much, and things people disliked about it.... heck see how many play the OG...
Can we get the big bang theory in fortnite lmao i would so buy
Is this real chat
Anyone else think that epic are doing too much? I'm hearing all of this and thinking oh no epic is doing the epic things again
I would like a world built around cartoons city’s. Like flinstones city, jetsons, Simpsons, futurama, family guy. Would be able to use certain things as mobility
So basically there copying Minecraft terraria and Mario cart all in 1
I like og fortnite since it was simple and fun instead of complex and sweaty
this is just not it.... severely disappointed
Those getting there v bux ready for the em skins rn 😂
Appreciate the spoiler warning for the event bud
nothing bout winterfest 23?
welp i suppose it’s the end of my career…again 😢
I’m an og and I love the og map, but Fortnite has to be move on and stay fresh and that’s what they’re going to do. They definitely know what they’re doing
Just one more step towards Epic trying to make Fn into a metaverse like Roblox or VRChat
this sounds absolutley horrible if i wanna play lego and rocket league ill play lego and rocket league wtf give us an actual fortnite update
So who had the ice idea first R6s or fortnite 💀
Fortnite has so many collabs it’s basically Disney infinity but with everything 💀
hope they put in “Poison by Bell Biv DeVoe” in the festival mode! And an emote using the song too
Ngl i dont believe these anymore its sounds kinda fake lol
NOTHING WILL BEAT OG!!!
Hi Everyone I love this and I hope you have a good day
Good video 😊
Guys I do not know about you but I think it’s wired that there is going to be a Lego collage and a racing mode because it just dose not fit into Fortnite and it will not feel like Fortnite anymore 😢
TBH they are trying to turn the game into something it is not so I think instead of stashing so much stuff in 1 game I think they should just make more games
i am so not going to play fortnite with this much updates
Fortnite chapter 5 is gonna be crazy
Are they keeping zero build?
So fortnite is trying to be roblox. Nice. I'll be uninstalling fortnite once again on december 2nd
I guess I’m quitting Fortnite again.  The only reason I came back is cuz I loved the simplicity of the OG map and guns.
fortnite is becoming roblox
Eminem coming tomorrow not on battle pass new chapter 5 season 1 it's coming tomorrow on item shop for 1500 to 2000 so yeah
All of this means nothing to those who started with Fortnite. When you over saturate a game and make it complicated no one is going to like it.
Fortnite is a battle based game and that's all I want it to be.  They can take their special musical events and racing games and other crap and throw it all away.  That's NOT what I play Fortnite for, and if they contaminate the game with this dreck too much I'll uninstall.
Teaser for flat earth in the beginning?
get closer to God pls there is gonna be many people who arnt going to make it to the kingdom of heaven🙏✝️
Eminem be hittin' different with his pump shotgun and scoped assault rifle. but like seriously, the fact that i'm about to witness marshal drinking a chug jug and then shooting rick sanchez with a 12 gauge and proceeding to throw up wu tang signs makes me want to be chronolgically frozen to see if maybe itll be better for our species in the year 69,420
is that lego mode going to be free ?
It was all good till he mentioned the locker who’s with me
Fortnite-We basically just took two really popular things Minecraft and lego
Chapter 2 map was ass tho
My xbox broke now I'm missing the finally
Please get rid of turbo building 🙄
Am I the only one that thinks that weapon mods are a bit too much?
Live events are boring when they turn into a bunch of minigames
Why does TBD look like a skinny version the save the world character
the 2 npc looks like gwen stacy
Chapter 5 will be mega
Wym it’s a reworked version of chapter 2
Deam is this still Fortnite?... xD
8:12 the event ends soon! Claim your rewards!
Hey t5g what happened to the old narrator
Nice
Idk what fortnite has become but damn they are ruining it miss the og map and stuff
Players on 2. December 📉📉
I’m just looking forward to seven jonesy
I appreciate epic letting me know when I can uninstall this again❤️
Until fortnight finds out Eminem swears
I think this is just to much
They should not make it so that you can customize a weapon other than skins.
Man epic doing to much
If the battle pass looks like the cover of this video I will actually cry
Finally First person! I have wanted this for forever
and meanwhile minecraft cant add 2 extra mobs
found the lego thing out while logging in to my epic. Lego was a login option
I hope this ain’t real
Looks like I’m quitting
If they don’t have zero build im going back to deleting this game off my console 😂
fortnite is copying cod alot
Hey T5G do you think we might get to see some old events scince were in the past and we’re going through the space between like season X mech vs monster etc
Huh. Sounds like the Lego mode is going to be very similar to STW in gameplay?
What about one piece in fortnight
December 2nd is my birthday so it will be the worst birthday ever :(
i love fortnite and minecraft i think fortnite should just do a acolab with minecrat and not take   every thing from minecraft
It would make sense that they would add the anvil rocket launcher back to counter the planes
Fortnite Chapter 5: Epstein Island
I hope they realize how big of a mistake it will be to not keep the OG map. The player base is going to plummet.
Fortnite’s another step closer to Roblox
Im on an addrn
Who tf wants first person mode ?? Smh that’s dumb af then the point of wearing skins would be no point 😊
These are usually not true sadly
To much stuff. Their all in attitude it’s not it. I’m already missing OG season
DOCTOR WHO??!!
Bruh this is to much
Small detail: the tire in the poster is actually the default tire from rocket league
Wondering if death animations for the Lego skin would actually break apart
Keep og Fortnite
Weapons, I just need to know what weapons/equipment are coming.
Epic might be the most brilliant gaming company ever. They have turned fortnite into more than a battle royale. It’s literally the new roblox for kids. The game will probably stay relevant for another 10 years atleast
So this is why they got rid of trading on rocket league 😢
NPC GIRL LOOKS LIKE GWEN FROM INTO THE SPIDER VERSE
I’m so not playing chapter 5
fortnite is doing too much
what happend to fortnite battle royale
What is a Fortnite??
Why cant this guy just speak naturally 💀💀💀
I wish I could play Rocket League but its physics are weird and sometimes annoying specially using a joystick.
When they said lady Gaga in the song thing I was thinking of peso pluma who else think he should be in the game
WAIT WHAT IF JONEWY NEEDS TO GET BRUTUS OUT OF THERE TO WORK /DO SOMETHING FOR SLONE
what about klombo ? 🙄 I never get to play with those guys T_T
Not gonna lie I didn’t play back in the day so OG fortnight was just a new map to me. Compared to the new stuff I hate it. It’s boring.
LEGO?!?!?!
epic should stick to the og format, the game got its all time highest player count just to return to the original map, why make so much changes?
I hope chapter 5 will never come
They should just keep OG BR as a separate game mode. And keep OG, OG. Not "airplane and balloon OG".
They should just leave OG season alone
I can’t wait for the Doctor Who stuff
Completely honest, kinda too much, like minecraft, cause by the time u catch up and master the stuff, its probably over. 😢
ngl but who the hell is excited for a dumb lego collab??
Lego box fights
Wish epic would make OG a game mode😭
This game sounds like it's gonna suck again
December second last game gonna hit hard 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Yeah, I’m quitting Fortnite when the new chapter releases…
as a person who loves rhythm games , the rhythm game is gonna be such a big W for me
Time to quit he game again
Ummm doctor who? 🎉🎉🎉 best thing ever.
Idk anyone who wants this over Chapter 1
Just keep it how it is rn and give us siphon for ranked like i mean you went from people making fun of your player base to playing your game like quit trying to make new maps its so dumb. I bet if the have that as the new nap with only 7 poi's which means if you get in a full lobby theres gonna be 14 players at each poi like thats dumb and i cant wait to watch the game die again. But thats only if the totally change the map and the loot pool. And dont add a train if i wanted to play cod i would trust me
To watch the live event, do you just go inti a normal game as usual and then go over to the rocket???
Are we getting new guns
I am not really hyped for the lego one, i wanna keep the normal skins
I really hope they pull a reverse where they take us back to season 2
Me
If they ruin the base game I’m never touching it again
Planes are already back tf
yayyyyyyy!
There is no train, you said it yourself that Apollo is a race circuit....
It's not going to be fortnight anymore
bro fortnite is gonna fall off if they only focus on other modes than br. like why the flip are we adding weapon mods? i js wanna play my basic chapter 2 gameplay 😔
Yeahhhh, Doctor WHO
Fortnite is about to set a world record, for number of players dropped in a day
Epic went all out on this update I'm so excited for it
Is this even fortnite anymore?☠
Me I will miss season OG
Ok, Eminem having three separate skins is stupid. That's what edit styles are for, you should get all three with one simple payment.
My birthday is one day before the Big Bang event
It's just too much being added to Fortnite, I just want it to stay simple. They could just make another game with all this stuff.
Im quitting after the og leaves as the game will return to being absolute garbage
I HOPE JUICE WRLD MAKES AN APPEARANCE
I’m so mad cuz I love Eminem and fortnite but I have to skip the event cuz I have to go to a marching band parade at the exact date and time it starts. ☹️
it was only fortnite og for a week
i got into an airplane and had no idea how to fly it... so i just nosedived off the mountain 🤣
4:07 when he said yacht I thought he said gyat.
why the lego in the thumbnail doing "the" salute 🙋‍♂🥸
Who knows what exactly the big reveal will be, but my guess is that The Visitor’s identity will turn out to be Donald Mustard.
If they are bringing back gold bars, they should add extra inventory slots that you can buy for like 1000 gold bars for one extra slot and then 2000 for a second extra slot and two extra inventory slots is all you can get
what if they col abed with monoply and made a board game with legos as part of the game!?
Let me say something about Fortnite I saw a lot of comments that was hating on chapter 5 and the modes but people if you see this you got to understand that Fortnite is an evolving game that needs to change and I know br is slowly being less important but that isn't a bad thing in fact it might be a good thing so just give Fortnite chapter 5 a chance and don't leave and I know the modes are not what Fortnite is you know Fortnite BATTLE ROYAL  but  hasn't really been a battle Royale in a long time so trust epic they might have something special for br thats not leaked but hey let's see  what's happening on Sunday but I bet it's going to be a BIG BANG!
Wow skins coming out nov 29 in my bday ❤️🤯
Tu
Who else isn’t going to play that stupid fall gays and Fortnite festival so Fortnite can focus on br
Will you get XP with the Lego one
Could you make it to where the round modes actually vary because out of the like twenty round modes you put on the wall onlt a handful actually work, and it's mainly only regular boxfight anyway so please fix it
E😮
I don’t think the Fortnite devs know the lyrics to poker face 😂
At this point Fortnite is just and app that has different games on it like Roblox. I’d rather have regular BR and not all the other things.
I think fortnite is slowly turning into cod lol!!😂😂
Thank you so much haven't played fornite in like 6 months because my xbox was broken 😢😢😮
Not me
after the og season is over im done playing it got really wierd like wth is the lego mode thats so dumb
This season has got me hooked on fortnite again. Can't wait for the new season
Let’s go we got numb!!
Who’s MNM
Tell epic to try to put the event at 6 or 7 pm. I have school! Please I do not want to miss it!
epic just cant live with the fact their greatest success is behind them
I hope the remove the spammer grenade launcher
ME 😭😭😭
Reason for the Wolverine claws is the new game coming out about Wolverine so  that’s why 👍🗿
Was that dafuqboom?
im gonna miss having a smooth fps 😔
I clicked this video because I saw a skin in the thumbnail that looked like the doctor
This is gonna be really good for epic since we get to try new things😭
Bornana
I miss the augmentation lol it was so fun
it's kind of overwhelming with all these extra collabs and game modes. I just wanted a new map with new guns and stuff.
"A LEG A LLAMA"- blarg
They are finally adding weapon attachments, now if they would get rid of the potions for armor, and just add real armor( tier armor like the weapons), and helmets which would function as armor for your head, this game would be much better in my opinion, always hated the using potions like an rpg game for armor...it would be much better if you actually picked up real armor and helmets for armor protection.
Tim sweeney too obsessed with his bs metaverse, work on the mode that brought you so much success
I still have my doubts about the Doctor Who skins. The Doctor running around with a machine gun, shooting down other people is the polar opposite of the image the BBC has cultivated of the doctor for 6 decades. One could argue that it's a simulation and the doctor isn't really shooting anyone, but I'd argue back that even in a simulation the Doctor wouldn't use guns. I just don't see it. Maybe I'm wrong. Who knows. Just seems odd.
If doctor who is coming I’m staying simple
i didn’t want a fortnite concert i wanted a normal event 😭
Lego no no next it gonna be Roblox this is a teen game 💀
When was the race mode leaked for the first time? September, August? I cant remember.
If most of these things then I feel like Fortnite won’t be like Fortnite anymore. When you think of Fortnite you think of battle Royale pvp not Racing, Music, and Open world sandbox
I don’t like it I want to stay on the original map hopefully they give a mode where you can pick between og and the new one
Fr
Yo you should make a Christmas kill animation wear the turn into a present
just give me chapter 4 back pls
OG was a total disaster, i regrett buying the battlepass, absolutly no fun to play; hope Season 5 gets back to how it was in Chapter 3, 4 was disappointing too
Hopefully Lego is its own mode we don’t need it as a main game collab
I want spider man web races
Bro chp5 finna be trash😢😢
Thanks for ruining the game
I hope they change the career tab to back how it was. I cant do anything with that.
3:14 that's my birthday! I'm turning 20
Are they going to bring back the augments???
Boutta drive Lightning McQueen in Fortnite
LETS SEE IF EPIC CAN FINALLY FOUND FIX THE BULLSHYT PROBLEM THAT CONSTANTLY KEEPS KICKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ...COMPLETELY RUINING THE ENTIRE EVENT EVERY DAMN TIME...💯💯💯
Eminem in Fortnite wtf💀
They’re ruining everything
👇L season
Time to never play fortnite again
im no kidding on but l think a got a chapter 5 leak add
Bro watch the train get vaulted because of glitches.
Lego = Roblox
Not playing if it isn’t OG
I’m disappointed we don’t need all these other game modes, they need to focus on the base game
I swear that epic cant go one week without changing the entire look of the game
guys says Imagine Dragons with enthusiasm and doesn't mention Alice Coopers name lol sad.
So idk if anyone has asked this yet but how is Eminem going to perform? Likes it’s fine for us og players cause most of us are in highschool or “enjoying our adult life” but what about the kids who play like Eminem isn’t exactly a kid friendly musician
And yet nothing for STW, the whole reason  we even have all of this 💔
Epic just casually blatantly stealing from rainbow six siege with those frozen grenades💀
Nothing is big enough to take this season away from me. See you all in another 6 years
I helped work on the live event
TACO TIME
1% WHAT YOU SAID IS TRUE 👍
I think there is gonna be a huge player drop when og is gone
Wtf is this
I wish first person comes
Is epic actively trying to ruin their game? We don’t need racing, Lego Minecraft or music stuff we just need the game we installed called Fortnite. If epic wants to do those things they should make new games
Where gonna be logged out for 36 hours and then play season5 chapter 1 I'm so excited
7:30 copying r6 is crazy
Lol no one’s gonna play the game modes. I’d rather just play rocket league or guitar hero
Why would they add rocket league to fortnite? You could just play rocket league. And epic literally owns rocket league wouldn’t it take players away from rocket league?
Fortnite becoming a gamehub/avatar kind of game was always a logical step for epic and only shows its growth its really crazy that this is a free game still
Very lame. No OG mode, big map overhaul and barely a change to the weapon pool. Just a bunch of modes I'll never play after a couple days /:
A new gun in Fortnite but you can get it in creative.  Duo. Silent pistol.
Yo
Why is Fortnite trying to be like every other game rn. Like, why can’t they just make the game unique and original???
RIP people who have Minecraft Rocket league and COD
I think that them portals in the lobby backround  are different  chapter maps
Lego collaboration sounds like Lego stw
December 9 is my birthday
Gayest game ever created
Can you stop with the bait thumbnail every time we're about to get a new season
We need one thing, SHIPON
Chapter 5 looks insane
Wait helios that is the god of light
Wow so fun their adding a bunch of game modes and all their doing for br is a remastered chapter 2 map
Dec 9th is my Bday :)
I want to know what the skin for Lego will be like 😂😂😂😂😂
What happened to juice wrld being in fortnite?
I just hope they don’t change the base game TO much.
YOOO. DOCTOR WHO IN FORTNITE!!! FINALYYYYYYY
TRAINS!!!!!??? Finally, after all these years
1 day gang  👇
They just abt to ruin the game for the 20th time 💀
U are making addicted
Nah we got lego Fortnite before gta 6
2:13 tbd is Gwen Stacey
Honestly, if the weapon addons are a thing I think it would ruin the whole game. I just want to be able to pick up a gun and go to battle without worrying about what type of things I need to add on, it just gets too complicated!
If Lego really comes to Fortnite Bionicles makes most sense
Lady Gaga in Fortnite 😭🤞🏼
Bro they just focused more in the other games modes and fortnite is starting to be come more for kids
Fortnites just becoming a kid version of warzone it's already starting to have sweats like in warzone but their doing way to much how am I supposed go keep up when they add everything all at once
Tommy doing gods work and sharing everything with us 🥹
Bro it would be dope if there was a Alice cooper concert
i'm scared of chapter 5 coming tbh i want it to be like this right now the fortnite right now is really fun but also chapter 5 looks promising but then again epic might epic it up and it becomes a massive gargle of random crap thrown together with no reason
December 2nd is my birthday 🎉 im soo happy
Yayyyyyyyyy the games gonna die again 😢😢😢
HE SAID THE CORRECT PLURAL OF LEGO RIGHT!!!!!
No one wanted any of this button👇
I’ve never been more hyped for a new season of Fortnite. All of these new game modes omg I’m so excited and I’ve talked with some of my friends and they’re hyped too! This season is going to be insane!
Interesting how they’re going from classic basic fortnite OG to the most changes they’ve ever made
Fortnight getting to complicated
Fortnite is doing wayyyyyyy too much
no ones gonna notice thst its a microphone, guitar, and a duck??. Sound familiar??🐻🐰🐤
Welp time for my phone to die😢
Rip fortnite. It went from being a br game to 5 games in 1
0:28 Chica, Freddy, and Bonnie😭🙏
i think fortnite is turning into the oasis from ready player one.
The wolverine claws could be for deadpool 3
This is insane
If they’re making all these system changes, I hope they add cosmetic trading at some point. People say they will lose revenue, but they could easily add a vbuck fee for each trade. It might add some excitement for people and even make more community connections between people.
cooooooooollllllllllllll
I hope they add The Polar Express for the train
Bro pls acknowledge that there is a hidden cup in the poster as well and it must mean The WORLD CUP IS ALSO COMING BACK MOST PROB
really hope we keep some or all of the og weapons
Has anyone noticed that that looks like Spider-Gwen a little 2:07
Not really that interested in the lego stuff but everything else sounds awesome!
I do not want augments to come back💀
Do you think there will ever be a one piece collab
This Lego open world just sounds like save the world
O my g_d_
whatabout the duck with sunglasses
Hey just wanted you to know the moving wall mode in box fight makes switch lag just as like a could think about but other than that it’s one of the best maps I’ve played inside of Fortnite
i like that they put a shot from minecraft story mode ep 6  5:19
The anvil rocket launcher might be added to the racing mode as an power up just like in Mario Kart
Theory during the event the visitor is revealed to be jonesy
they should keep the og map as a ltm and have each season rotate every week
That new skin looks like Gwen from spider verse
I started playing on Chapter 4 Season 4 and I loved it. None of this sounds like it’s going to top that imo
woooooooooooooah a M&M concert.... Who sings nasty dirty lyrics and there having him on a kids game?? FORTNITE DEAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDD
I’ve been saying this for years, they should add a feature that you can play in any season or chapter you would like, I think that is what the memorable reveal is. It’s makes sense with the Time Machine, it might get cloned so we all can have it or lobby’s.
What i´m afraid of is how many Gigabytes will this weigh.
Imagine Epic watching this then they like scrap most of what all you guys said.
This is not fortnite anymore :( but it looks cool but I'm kind of sad:(   And yes I like my own comment
Guitar and a microphone chance it could be Freddy and Bonnie from Fnaf, would be pretty cool
I have a theory… so since we are in the chapter 1 map (with some changes) maybe they are planning to either redo, or bring back the old chapter maps each future season, or each future chapter. If this is true, we could be near to the end of Fortnite forever. Because T5G showed a revamped chapter 2 map.
😅
End of OG is not a countdown timer, it is a downfall timer
Also a message to you Top5Gaming you always get it wrong you have been yapping about Lego for seasons and it still hasn't come true.
Fortnite is trying to make babies be allowed to play it. Fortnite sucks now with this rating stuff bro and now they're adding Lego like what. it is honestly kind of disappointing that Fortnite has stooped this low. And the fact that tilted Zone wars is rated g is just crazy.
fortnite should stick to battle royale instead of being roblox
They could make Lego golden, brown, black and a store where you can put money and other people can steal money and use it to open chest
I'm so excited for enimen(I can't spell it😭)
Me and my friend thought the guitar and the microphone meant five nights at Freddy’s is coming 💀
Og can go now it was a fun time remembering the good ole days but time to move back forward
fortnite is roblox rn
Were is Fall out boy?
Nah Freddy fazbear's microphone
We need South African servers. please like this comment
This game is gonna be so trash
0:57 ☝️erm actually it’s a bass because it’s got 4 strings
they needa keep the og map it’s better than these new maps they’ve released. It has a better Loot system and weapons that are more simple to use. Not to mention the game actually felt fun to play after 5 longs years. Only running into bots wasn’t fun and people who started after the og season dont understand how peak it was in that time. OG Fortnite will always be the best version of fortnite and you can’t change my mind. 🤷‍♂️
I hop3 we actually get a good battle pass this season. Theyve really sucked for the past few and this one has potential
I know you won't look at this message but if you remember the blue cube what if that was the cube king?
Didn't we already have a ice bomb?
they might be ruining fortnite with this one
fortnight fest comes out on my b-day
As a life long fan I am so hyped for the Eminem concert!
the sweat are already here
Imagine the Fortnite live event was the GTA VI trailer 😅
2:07 Am I the only one who thinks the second NOC looks like a clone of Spider-Gwen?
Am I the only one who just wants fortnite to remain simple like the og map? It's so much more fun.. why doesn't epic just make a whole new game for all this new stuff instead of ruining fortnite..  Bruh- yall are pressed af for no reason. This is just personally my opinion about the game. Even if they keep changing it, im still gonna play it and have fun.
One thing I don't like about the chapter 5 update is that they are literally just making a remake of rocket league in fortnite... I mean you might as well just play the game bro
They have officialy killed fortnite themselves
undergroundrebel not jonesy
0:55 It's not a guitar, It's a bass. Great video
Mid
klombo
Music mode should have a wide variety of songs
Imagine Emmet greeting you in the battle pass next season
Sooo they are doing other games and making it Fortnite- instead of doing new stuff
Bro fortnite is turning in to GTA 5
When he showed the chapter 2 Island? There was no grotto.
All I want is Fortnite OG. They need to work on what makes Fortnite Fortnite.
Fortnite is turning into roblox
They doin to much
am i the only one who saw a lego llama in the lobby
Hope it is not delayed like UEFN😢
I literally hate Fortnite. I’m always missing out on live events cuz they start at like 2 am and stuff so I always miss out. :(
As one of the janitors at epic games I don’t know why the company does so many collabs
The hair on the TBD skin looks like the hair Gwen Stacy is usually seen with especially in Across The Spider-verse, IDK though
I finally get to drive the ECTO-1 YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE DOCTOR WHO CROSS OVER
I just hope we get just as much effort for Winterfest this year!!! ☃️🎄🥹
yeah this game is gonna die
I have a small feeling that this will be the downfall of fortnite again, since they are removing the old map
Bro this cant be real lego
ummm sorry to be that dude but actually its a bass not a guitar in the teaser
Because both of them are cubes
Gum cubes are Kevin the cube style interns it turns into literally purple then it turns into blue like Kevin turning was purple then he turned into blue. That’s a reference.
Am I the only one who noticed that all of the storyline important POI's were in the middle of the map in chapter 2?
Fortnite is gonna have a kanye collab. The live event is happening at 2pm est, which is 7pm gmt-gmt being the timezone of the uk, a country which kanye claims to visit in his song: american boy, and another one of kanyes songs: wonder mentions the lyrics "7 O'Clock thats prime time" and it is gonna be 7pm gmt during the event- the prime time of the season, unique due to it being the first live event in 1 year
I want a offline mode
frozen grenades? wow they rip off everything. look up the new rainbow 6 siege operator
We’re getting sued gg
ah so the reason rocket league has been lascking REAL updates is because fortnite makes them more money. The reality is so sad and now ive stopped plaign fortnite. the only time i do paly frotnite is when friends ask me to play
Honestly all these changes don’t look fun at all it just looks overwhelming and that’s exactly why I stopped playing. I feel like bringing back the old map taught epic that less is better and that we don’t need trains bosses or any of these crazy things just a small loot pool and a good map is enough to have fun. Not legos racing game modes or a train on a bad map. The game is gonna go so downhill from here.
They are adding TOO much, we don't need an entire mode dedicated to button mashing too songs.
Imagine rap god playing as the whole map explodes
When I load up Fortnite, I want to FIGHT people. If I wanted to play Rocket League, I would play Rocket League. If epic adds all of these things, they shouldn't be surprised to see their player count drop massively.
bro i’m grounded for the next month
Nice Video!
You can already play poker face if you have the emote with the jug thing that you can do with other people
that’s brazy onb
This Update looks like it will be 40GB+
that's a bass
Planes are in fortnite rn
It’s cool and all but the game is getting complicated
feels like too much
This isn’t Fortnite anymore. It’s something else and it’s disgusting
Hi
Or hear me out the microphone and guitar could be Freddy and Bonnie from Five Nights at Freddy’s
Lets be real- whos gonna actually play the new lego and other modes .
Epic is giving leakers all this stuff to build hype and get more players Source: trust me bro
GTA FORTNITE
The duck,microphone and electric guitar reminds me of five nights  at Freddy’s
3:30 looks more like the chapter 3 map for some reason
They are killing their own game now. BR will be left out and all of us will basically be playing, forza, lego and minecraft in fortnite.
So the live event will be 2PM for the UK  Damn will miss it because doctor who
they keep adding so many modes yet still havent brought back ltms...
awe im deleting fortnite after this
L season
What they should have done is made it so that we can visit every season map and relive every Fortnite event.
all of this sounds fun, but give me at least an og map and items gamemode(season 1) and save the world updates, then do your thing with everything else
We need more metal representation in Fortnite  I’m tired of all of this rap and pop garbage
When is the fnaf coming to fortnight 😂😂😂
I hate epic. They removed trading in rocket league JUST SO THAT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY CAN BECOME A MINI GAME!
My kills didn’t count up I got 2 kills and the next day I got 1 more but when I checked it only said 1 but not 3
First day gang 👇
If lego came there would be no difference between roblox, Minecraft n fortnite😂
Question if we have the oh map back does that mean that the chapter 2 map is under it
Hopefully the downtime isn’t too long
Well this season ganna be ass
Maybe that’s what that musical guitar weapon leak was for? Or maybe it’ll be added into BR to hype festival mode…
Fun fact: one of the confirmed lego skins is Wingman. This is the most acknowledgement he's gotten since C2S1's locker icon refresh, and I'm so happy cause he's been my main since the day I started playing
This season waa fun but this stuff sounds cool
The memorable reveal will be that Donald Mustard is the bus driver i got money on that
The live event might go in reality’s and see everyone
If they make a new map ive lost all hope. The game is in the best state its been in since chapter 1. Epic doesnt know when to realize that 40 millon players in one day means something. We all, or at least most of us, want the og map. Im tired of the map always changing, chapter 1 needs to stay. But sadly, my dreams are gonna be crushed in a week. It was fun while it lasted.
IM HYPED FOR THE EVENT
I wonder if we will be able to use the LEGO skins in regular BR. Just imagine
Planes are aleady back
POV your a mass I’ve Fortnite and doctor who fan
Will the Travis Scott skin be back then?
Man they need to stop putting the events on week days
Fortnite is just becoming Roblox
i wonder if there will be Emmett skin
The gun change is literally cod
most of this will probably be fake
Can't wait
DMZ mode?
As a og who has been playing since chapter 1 season 2 this sucks first of all the map is trash a big map means that less player interaction means less fights and more running around doing nothing  and the pois on the map look bad also why does a battle royal need a racing mode and a mindcraft rip off mode if I wanted to play those games I would play those games fortnite should focus battle royal instead of ripping of other games the name of there game is battle royal and a racing battle pass wtf I know the fortnite kids with love this stuff but all the ogs are gone why bring us back in the first place if your going to do all the stuff that made us leave in the first place just to spit in our faces one more time and why do another black hole that was so ass the first time and why keep changing the art style they should have just keep og fortnite and for those people saying it would get boring not true look at other games like apex call of duty they make little changes and people are happy if it ain't broke don't fix it also what is with all these dumb collabs I don't want doctor who in this game I want a fun battle royal a I am done with this game
How to participate in this live event?
The Lego thing sounds like Lego Universe damn
They need to add Taylor Swift
hey top5 it looks like the kevin island is gone in the leak?
Did you forget that the jug band emote plays Poker Face? So Lady Gaga has been in the game.
It’s going to be the biggest fail for Fortnite cause everything gonna be made out of Legos
"its gonna be a competitor to minecraft" *shows minecraft story mode"
As a big lego fan can't wait for the lego collab
they are dropping gta 6 trailer at the end
0:55 this is a bass guitar, dude... plz more respect
M&M🤣🤣🤣🤣
Train in Fortnite going to feel like that popular train jailbreak update
Ok so lemme guess there will be a bug in the first reality and the world will be all buggy and other stuff from other dimensions that arent fortnite related will come..interesting
i wish epic should put more attention on save the world
I know it’s a long time in the future but maybe they’ve added the wolverine claws to make changes to them for when deadpool 3 comes our
Don't put this video on my iPad ever again.
I am upset because my pc broke at the start of the season and now I can’t play and it happened after i spent 10 dollars on v bucks 😢
4:31 WARNING SWEATS IN THIS GAME
Yes I can’t wait for the wolverine mythic it was my favorite it’s too good
Ngl season  og was mid at best
Not me
Not a fan of LEGO so not excited about it at all. However, excited for the racing mode.
they are doing too much lmao
huge L too mutch bs im not going to be playing
ALICE COOPER IN FORTNITE?!
It sounds like fortnite is turning into save the world
this aint even fortnite no mo 😭
Mreeee
Im gonna be with my favorite cousin play the live event
Love your chanel!!!!
cant wait to hit the griddy as lego jonesy
5:26 this sounds a little bit like rust?
They bring in racing with our cars from rocket league ima bust. Gonna be those Batmobiles I don’t use bc I rarely play rocket league!
this is looking to be one of the worst updates of all time
I went to a soccer game yesterday and my team mate said hes not going to play it because it was rated 3+ and i said were did you here that and he said my brother.
I cant wait to steal the vault from society estate.
I sadly will miss the live event because I will be on a trip to Germany so I can’t bring my Xbox with me
avenged sevenfold also tweeted a teaser for fortnite, maybe thats what the guitar is for
I can’t play the live event I have school
Epic will do anything, including adding tons of bots to matches and adding 30 game modes, but nerf building.
They should add more LTM'S
Not even gonna lie the new (old) map got a lil boring by now… it was nostalgic at first but the newer maps have always had so much more to do and new weapons and shii to do which makes more exciting for me
I wish this game would realize that if we wanted to play rocket league or fall guys, we would just go play the game and I don’t even care if it’s in the new season. You don’t have to ruin the event with it.
This event boutta be worse than fracture
Fortnite: We now have Trains! Apex:  💀
why dont they focus on making the map, but they focus on gamemodes
u kno wforntites dead when t5g stops playing
When does chapter 5 come out
didn't excpect to see chase mc caine from lego city undercover at 6:15
I don’t wanna get my hopes up tbh
I just played and It spawned me in the spectating area with weapons
Damn they cooked
all this but you cant add South africa/african servers  :/
yeah… im quitting again
bro said m&m concert
The new season look likes it’s gonna ruin the game I don’t want all this crossovers
So many people came on just to play og fornite. I really hope that this next chapter will be big and make people want to keep playing!
hi
I mean this chapter 5 is not going to be fortnite anymore, Its going to be like roblox
I JUST GOT A VICTORY ROYLE WIN BC I SAW THIS VIDEO THANK YOU :)
why does the new map look like a rust map
so the Lego thing is Minecraft but just a little different?
LINKIN PARK IN FORTNITE HELLL YEAHHHHHHHH!!!!
So is nobody gonna talk about how at 2:09 TBD looks exactly like Gwen Stacy from Acrosss The Spiderverse?
If all that coming. That update size is going to be freaking huge
Ain’t it weird that there might be another lockdown and that chapter 5 is based off of chapter 2
Eminem has never played fortnite why are they giving him A Event
Everything but the locker🎷
i do not wnat to be forced to play as lego man i wana play my xenomorph
if lego would realese that lego llama i will buy it
well. looks like its time to stop playing when og goes away
hopefully we don't lose planes... I just got into fornite and i used to play endless World of Warplanes lol, and flying / shooting in fornite has been so freaking enjoyable
Hi
Roblox:   Joined the chat
I need a damn Lady Gaga skin!!
Fortnite is going to change FOREVER after this update and I love your videos. Keep up the good work!😊
I think top five gaming should get his own skin in Fortnite. Do you agree with me?
jeez so mutch stuff epic have for us hope its good
I'm pretty sure that the racer skin near the start is penny just less thick
I will miss you OG ❤ I’m probably gonna uninstall after 2 months but it’s been fun
They need to keep a og permanent mode or the game is gonna die like it did in chapter 2 and 4
The rock band avenged sevenfold also just released a picture hinting they might be in fortnite also
Ch5 is what ch2 should have been
Battle pass
Well it was an honour to play on the og map but it will soon be time for epic to ruin their game with shitty updates no one asked for and it will finally be time to quit Fortnite forever and be a peace
Not me
I think
Bro the time machine is gonna make the rocket go to a different timeline and we are gonna get in the rift where it is taking it
What's up with the red dot in the sky north 30ish?
Yay I’m the .2000th comment love you tg
I think they did og becuz after next update this won’t be a battle Royale
Wait so there will maybe be fortnite themed lego
This is just becoming Roblox. With so much other games in this one game. it will destroy the simpelness of fortnite and will ruin it
I hope they add an OG game mode so that we can still play the OG map after it’s gone
Look thing is fortnite good and all but thing is did rocket league dirty with trade in tho  Look thing is. Sounds good but   Be worse
Do not play with my emotions on a Doctor Who collab. I will lose my mind
5:19 Story Mode my beloved 🥲.
That one skin looks like Gwen from spider man across the spider verse
memorable finish will probably be the rocket destroying the zero point and sending us to chapter 5 with the end music (I beg they use the end music)
This is either gonna be great and change Fortnite completely, OR... Its gonna completely ruin the game.
Also the collab with avenged sevenfold
fortnite is becoming roblox
lego mode will be crap
Fortnite is about to die
If lego gets added to fortnite I'm gonna kill myself
For season OG, they should've brought the OG UI back
Don't split the screen into 4 that's gonna be harder
With the new rock band mode I hope they release the power guitar that was leaked in c4 s1 yeah I still remember
Does fortnite have multiplayer Will grandson like this game
I think that the Wolverine claws are for Deadpool 3 that has Wolverine in the movie
The game does look interesting, but it's getting too complicated with Lego, music mode, rocket league, and fall guys.
2:13 raceing gwen stacy? It has her exact hair
ryan gosling 2:09
where are the shield thing , that if you use a big shield and you need only 20 %  it will use only 20% then you can save the other 30% for later ?
As a rocket league player…. Fight for our trading to stay and not be lost because Fortnite
BRING BACK OG T5G MUSIC
What game are we landing at boys💀💀
MAKE OG FORTNITE A GM PLEASE
season og will be missed. rest in peace soon.
Im pretty sure brutus is here for emeinem hes gonna  be the security guard for emeinem and that girl is supposed to be hailey his dwughter
Im pretty sure brutus is here for emeinem hes gonna  be the security guard for emeinem and that girl is supposed to be hailey his dwughter

Im pretty sure brutus is here for emeinem hes gonna  be the security guard for emeinem and that girl is supposed to be hailey his dwughter
The live event
too much crossovers and collabs. they just need to focus on the game
It’s on my birthday I’m so excited 🎉🎉
Apollo is the name of my puppy
So basically it isn’t gonna be fortnite anymore
Epic should bring it especially since GTA 6 is around the corner 👀
And for save the world nothing 😔
I'm not going lie when I saw space the i got ptsd from tfo. If yall have not play it yet play the forgotten ones 5 and you will see it.
Epic just needs to keep the loot pool simple, we don’t need 5 different shotguns that all do different things.
How long og been out
I just want chapter 2 season 2 back
where wallrunning
They’ve added first person before console fov
!!!!
Doctor how
Can’t wait for dr who
Can't wait for eminem and lego in fortnite
I really like LEGO so I am looking forward to what Epic does with the collab
This is gonna be big... the biggest since UE5.. and im here for it this is so awesome getting to live and play this game
Is  this even fortnite  anymore?
Maybe the reason why they added Wolverine claws into the files because of the new Wolverine game what Insomniac is making
Instead of replacing areas why not add/expand the map.
im so disspaionted in fn if they completley remove the og map even as ltm im retiring again i played this season so much and it was so funn it brought together old frieds of mine to play again and i relised how much fortnite can be but also how much the map and machanics affect the expiriance so if they remove the og mode i think im just done again i was happy not playing fn for the past 3-4 years and i will happily quit again...
tell Fortnite that the toggle first person mod and third person mode is to press F5 like Minecraft
There is no need for the game to be that complicated.
this update is going to be like 50 gb
thank god they didnt add coral castle back
NOOOOOOOOOO THEY ARE RUINING LEGO
defo not playing next season
All this sounds horrendous
Fortnite just ain’t fortnite anymore
That new character looks like gwen stacy
There’ll be no competition to minecraft
hope the event is not just one big advert for the new game modes....
I heard train and immediately thought of Demon Slayer, the mugen train arc. This would be a perfect time for a collab
Honestly, if the Eminem concert has a similar style to the Travis Scott concert, then it will by far be the best ever concert in Fortnite.
I'm exited for the Eminem concert.
If they make any more guns trash I’m not playing
Personally I'm glad the seasons over.
1:15 yo give me the golden scar
BROO THIS CHAPTER 5 UI IS GOING TO BE TRASH BC OF THE NEW AI AND WHY NOT THE AS CHAPTER 4
who else misses chapter 3 when fortnite was good
I hope they add a dc skin in the battle pass. Because from the looks of it, there is no other choice but to add a dc skin in chapter 5 battle pass. I know that just for sure.
Fortnite: The game that sucks other existing games into it along with real life celebrities, cartoons, and memes.
We need a Updated Fortnite Storyline video! Would make me understand everything before the event
juice wrld man…
lego mode, race mode, rhythm mode, fall guys mode, fortnite is turning itself into roblox bro
Ngl they adding too much it could ruin the game Ngl.
the smart smg is probally auto shooting p 90
Can I get this straight for uk people the event is 2 pm then when it explodes it turns into a black hole for two days the new season starts on the eight cold December then winter fest on the 12
Anyone realise the Lego llama?
The og season was fun till level 70 bc there’s nothing to do now bc I wanted to maybe go to a hundred
Me 0:46
Will the whole map be Lego and our skins be outfits and one thing all my progress from 3 years ago will be comign to Fortnite form rocket league
did not know the box fight pvp was yours played with a couple of freinds and it was a blast ima fav it
Loving your videos
the reveal is Eminem is the visitor
Shame they had to kill rocket league for this update
the og season did bring the good map  but there were only 4 skins and that too weren’t too good.
Fortnite turning into Roblox, we have a creative mode for players to do what they want (ex. Tycoons), now a racing mode, a lego map thats like lego worlds an already existing game, a rhythmn game, like what are they thinking to add to a br game  Its dissapointing really, but im glad to see that they are putting in some work, sadly not in the correct way
0:56 that aint a guitar thats a bass bro wtf
THE SLIM SHADY IS HERE!!!!
🗿
Fortnite chapter 4 was a disaster and failure Hence epic gatherd lost players with og and will try to fix every mistake by launching chapter 5 an well built map
It would be cool if they make a racing map for each chapter map
I really want that *click click click click* sound effects from the actual lego gems
evolve? Pokémon cross over?
I’m gonna miss Chapter 1 SO MUCH
Pls dont change the locker UI! Its good as it already is!!!
ngl the chapter 5 map looks like something out of rust
Honestly, I’m not going to miss season OG
Fortnite=roblox in my opinion they are going too far
is it me or does T5G sound like gametheory
And they Fu$ked OG😢
Fortnite is going to die at last🙁
Fortnite is trying so hard to revive their dead game
The reason everyone loves the OG fortnite is because its simple. So many players came back and now they are ruining it again
Imagine Thomas the tank engine in fortnite
After fortnite og fortnite is gonna make a world record for how many players lost in 24 hours....
I Hope if the Sonic screwdriver maybe a pickaxe
can i get royale bombs on ps5?
I really don't know what I think about weapon mods. I don't think I'm the only one that always liked that you just pick up weapon and don't have to worry about anything else.
Probably for the release of Deadpool 3 8:34
Why don't they just make these separate games
Me
I just want to play regular fortnite 🥺
Guys now we only need a wave of fortnite lego sets . I would buy ngl .
So glad OG is going away. So many mechanics taken out just to bring back Fanbois. Bring on chapter 5!
Looks like they are ripping off cod and minecraft
Imagine John was the geno leader of io
Underground jonesy is probably going to be if jonesy didn’t eat peels and lived together
It’s Fortnite battle royal. Not Roblox. Ffs
this is not fortnite anymore....
I know that in the end when BR is continued like before all the other changes don't matter for those who want to enjoy Fortnite as the shooter it is, yet I understand when people say that this isn't Fortnite anymore. I'm not an OG, I started in C2S4, but I know this as a shooter with creative mode. So hearing about all this new ideas is as somewhat strange to me, too. Now imagine how real OGs feel about it. I know if I don't like the new modes, I just shouldn't use them. I am aware of this. It's about the feeling, about what a game that we loved for years has become as a whole. With every change we lose a part of the nostalgic Fortnite we got to know. Yet after all I'm looking forward to new weapons, new mechanics, new places, etc. Around the time when C3 started my life also underwent some changes that I didn't like so I really hated that change (especially with all the cold ice on the map). But know I embrace change - at least more than a few years ago.
Not me
Not me
Well, that's the good video we want, not clickbaiting or even bad videos to increase the hate, this is actually a very good video, and i want to warning all if you read my comment, don't take the leaks seriously, remember the last time of the leaks, has end really bad, all hate the last live event and was Fracture, but then revealed then wasn't something great and not for the live even but from the people tell they get crashed during the game, and when you get crashed, there isn't going back, i just hope this live event will give good happiness and of course, give people fun, and hope all of this will end up everything in happy, because if there is another hatefest, we end up the next live event will be in 2 years, and we really have problems, so my suggestion is to be happy and of course enjoy it.
My kill are reset on Your map
they need to make it so pokerface has a chance for the song to be sung by eric cartman
I Hope Doctor Who actually happens I’m a huge fan
Personally I don’t like it exept the Lego update
7:55 !!! Doctor who i love it.
I hope it at least lasts a year
I have an issue with box fight pvp, the thing is that whenever I join the game my kills reset so I can’t unlock the stuff unless I play for a really long time, so if I want to get the pet I might have to play for hours without leaving the game, and I don’t even know if the pet will stay there the next time I come back so hopefully this gets fix since I really wants some cold kill animations whilst also keeping all my kilss
Why are u leaving alice cooper out ??
Does anyone know about the 1 plane one the map theres only 1.
The update is gonna be insanely big
Epic: Make the community happy and keep the og map ❌ Epic: LEGO MINECRAFT!!! ✅
2:09 is it just me or dose she look like gwen Stacy from spider verse??
Lego mode is just save the world x Minecraft
Me
Epic should focus on its roots. Fortnite Br as it was in its prime and also (hot take) save the world. I dont like Br after chapter 2 and all those new chapter 5 things feel like a huge cash grab because a lot of people came back to fortnite in og season. They did it to get a lot of attention and those corporations feel like epic making fortnite a family friendly family game instead of a battle royale and pve based game. So i am very very sad to see the development of this game since 2021. And i say that as a player from 2017.
Why did I see Godzilla?😅
i’m kind of disappointed lowkey bc like why introduce eminem lego and race car driving in a live event, i feel like they should focus more on the event than the collaborations and save it for more events leading to more hype and money
For me fortnite OG is one of the worst seasons ever for everyone who agrees   👇
Bro Is the Fortnite mat pat
If I can hit the griddy as a Lego Peely  This game would be a 10/10🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Weres tilted
3:00 OMG I'M A BIG LINKIN PARK FAN!!!
What if the guitar weapon would come to fortnite since the music is coming??
How many battlepasses will there be next season?!!??!
W
We will all mis the fortnite og😢
They adding Imagine Dragons - Thunder to Fortnite now? Uninstalling 🙏
aight 7days till hitting the uninstall button
Not gonna lie I like your no fight map only I lag on it? Idk if it’s a bug but it also resets my progress every time I leave the game 😢
DUDE IMAGINE A TRAIN WITH A GROUP OF HOMING ANVIL ROCKETS BEHIND IT, DERAILING THE TRAIN
Is it me or are they adding too much stuff 🤔
Which eminem skin should i buy?
Eminemmmmm
He should perform VENOM at the event😔
Lady Gaga is technically already in Fortnite with a synced emote that plays Poker Face's instrumentals. It's the one where you blow on a vase
Umm it's called a "bass" 🤓
I CAN'T WAIT!!!
My pc c drive will not have enough space for these updates
If Fortnite is adding Lego, do you think Lego is going to have fortnight Lego sets?
gotta grind STW more to get some Em skins
I literally couldn't understand how people even want first person in Fortnite!!!! A game all about cosmetics like weapon wraps, skins, and backblings will have no meaning in first person. Even if first person was an option, it would still be unreasonable, no one put money on cosmetics to see them not!
How about they make fortnite 2 and keep that as og fortnite and continue normal fortnite with the rest of the seasons.
We’ve come a long way
Yup im gonna play on Nova
Unicron
When the event happens will the ui with all the gamodes disappear only leaving the event gamemide ??
Awesome Video T5G!!!  I'M SOOOOOO EXCITED FOR THE LIVE EVENT AND CHAPTER 5!!!!!!
With all this stuff did anybody else forget about winterfest
Who else wants choppers back👇
If the open world mode is only for Lego I am going to be mad, other than that I am excited for a new era of Fortnite
If they have so much money why can’t we have our own thoughts on next season no weird location map just go back in OG fortnite sucks
Yeaaaaa. LINKIN PARK BABY THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT
T5G the kills dont save
Yayyyyyy..... Im so excited im going to die like 470 times a season
Bro, the Fortnite festival event is happening on my birthday
Love the vids keep it up 😅
Thank god og Fortnite was a mess
Bro rlly got sponsored in fortnite💀
They should at Fortnite OG as a playable gamemode
NAH bro DID ALICE COOPER DIRTY
Personally, I just hope they add Creative 2.0 to consoles like PS4,PS5,Nintendo Switch and Xbox.  All the other stuff sounds fine I guess , as for OG Season , I won’t really miss it tbh but I know that’s not the case for everybody.
i really want them to give the scientist a time suit
Yo
its not even fortnight anymore its just a sandbox game at this point......
who wants a nick eh 30 icon??
I have a bad feeling about the legs mode because if it is basically ripping off Minecraft and if mojang find out there might be a court case and try to sue them
Looks like retirement is coming again
The guy below me is cool
hes the skip the tutorial of fortnite
I have exams in😭😭
Honestly, going back to OG was a nostalgic trip for all of us, but dwelling in the past doesn’t get us anywhere. I want to see what’s up next for Fortnite, and where Epic will take us next. I know most of you won’t take my side on this, but it’s my opinion.
Bro...💀 Not even capping, i had a dream of the big bang event 💀
I don't play much fortnite but I came back for og and really enjoyed it. Finished my battle pass got my gold skins I played that much. Seeing all this content is wild I may play this a lot it's looking fun
Train + Omniman bad idea
3:00 why didn't you say alice was coming aswell. I f*ing love Alice! I'm hyped for Linkin park aswell🎉
Avenged Sevenfold also teased a project in Fortnite
A gamemode with all save the world guns would be kinda cool ngl
I think they need to stop overloading the game. All these collabs sound great, but I feel like it’s just too much. And if they ad any more mechanics to the game, us controller players won’t have any more buttons to bind them to (I already had to unbind my marker).
What if sheldon from big bang theory comes to Fortnite
plaines were allready back
"Unforgettable event" I don't know about that chief, new events are forgettable. The only one that I have yet to forget is Season X black hole event...
The unreleased outfit with Brutus looks like Gwen stacy
Fortnite will be LEGO
I think there trying to much
The lego collabs survival one sound like the teased fortnight open world
Theory: my thought about the new chapter; The Big Bang is that at the end of the live event and Eminem will make the world explode! making the Zero Point reveal itself and having to make a knew world to protect itself, and bringing more enemies to fight and capture the zero point. Its also like Chapter 3's silver goo explosion (cant remember wat its called).
Why are they making on a school day during school hours 🥲
Im still holding hope and waiting patiently  for dr who
The player count📉📉
Theory: Count how many black holes there are in the new lobby background, then remember the chapter that we are abt to enter.
Finally just when I thought it could get any worse, fortnite finds another way to screw the game up again, and again and again
0:39 abt time T5G said something abt this
Who else is gonna miss this season? I sure am.   And they should make the racing default skins free if you do quests
I wonder if the train will be stoppable
Nahhhhh not attachments 😭😭😭
This isn’t fortnite anymore enough is enough fortnite is becoming to big
Save the world mfs: oh no not again
yup… as i expected, right after the event i’ll be uninstalling this again..
lets gooooooo more things to spend more money on!!!
Time to quit fortnite cuz og is going away
Bro is the most clickabate YouTuber ever
Fortnite went from a battle royale game to roblox💀💀
I think the memorable reveal will be a presentation of every best clip of every single season.
I can make orange rhyme with banana
On Helios, the top right looks like lazy lagoon.
I'm going miss Fornite og but I'm too excited for chapter 5
PlutoV2
@Plutov2 meeeeee
they destroyed fortnite
Wait a sec doesn’t tbd look like the Gwen from spider man?
I was not able to play season og
Why was Poison by Alice Cooper skipped ?
LINKIN PARK!!!
If they add weapon attachments, it's pretty much gonna be Call of duty but in Fortnite
What if the wolverine claws are for a deadpool 3 collab
Africa from toto lmao😂
So the Rocket League game mode allows us to use our own cars ect... So if I use my SAW car that's technically a cross over?
OMG this is so much I cant wait
Who saw lightning McQueen at 7:05😂
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
They're doing to much...
Me
It will not be fortnite
@7:00 And most importantly: JackRabbit.  As in: Jazz Jackrabbit, as in that IP that absolutely needs to come to Fortnite after all these years, and NOT just in poster form.  :P
Fn becoming dead season by season
IF YOU CAN USE YOUR ROCKET LEAGUE CARS IN FORTNITE YOU CAN USE THE NINTENDO CARS IN FORTNITE
You know how Forntite adds a new gameplay mechanic like sliding every chapter? I think for chapter 5 they should add a prone mode (lay all the way down)
I don't know if you guys noticed but in ATK you can switch between stations and there are a few that play Eminem songs like Venom and Lucky you
this sounds so boring i don’t think the players who came back will play this
What about the exclusive cars that you get from PlayStation and switch
That is a bass not a guitar
Hi
no don't you get it the duck, mic, and guitar correspond to fnaf
bring back catty corner
Imagine getting clipped by a brick man
I bet this comment will not get more than 5 likes
I grounded I can't see it 😢😢😢
Do we really have to say bye to og fortnite 😭
personally i love the locker redesign i just think they gotta make it more og looking not so modern weird
I wonder if they will make eminem's performance family friendly? Also my birthday is december 7th intime for the lego update!
Bro totally skipped over Poison by Alice Cooper. Lol.
The wolverine claws are probably for a Deadpool 3 collab
They might as well get rid of rocket league, Mario kart, asphalt 9 legends and Forza horizon First edit. They also might as well get rid of fall guys more. This is how I go out of business and lose everybody that wants to play Fortnite bro just ruining the game. It’s actually getting annoying at this point like it used to be good and this season was like the best season in a long time. Second edit back again I just can’t even watch the rest of the video 10:37 the worst part is just like under a minute
2:09 she looks like gwen
Honestly, these colabs have gotten out of hand. What I would give just to go back in time and live out the simple, TRUE Fortnite glory days
Since street fighter haven’t return. Like I don’t feel joy in what Fortnite will do next in anything.
This deaden sounds like it’s Going to suck besides the Eminem colab
Who else noticed a peice of the rocket in the meteor, even tho its at dusty?
Somebody cooked here
The big reveal will be Fe4rless and ceeday (hopefully 😭😭)
The mode is not going to be a competitor to Minecraft
I want weapon charms more than weapon mods but o e is better than none
I might not play
Preferred C1 over all of this
bro i want a slipknot concert and at least the chapter 2 season 5 map
Let’s be serious.......oh Much is going to be the Update 😭😭like a 20 Gigabytes update ?
im gonna quit fortnite its going places bad places, ive been playing since og season 1 i have renegade raider purple skull and pink ghoul trooper and all the other stuff probaly gonna give the acc to my little brother its been a journey...
Who is gonna buy this season battle pass 👇
I wish we didnt do anything in events and we just watched
This is actually insane, I'm here for it
Now if only they gave STW more love, instead of taking thing from it.   the Dr. Who thing has me mixed and I'm a big Dr who fan
MAKE OG FORTNITE A PERMANENT GAME MODE!
did you know that the singer of linkin park died rip
This isnt even fortnite anymore- they're just making the game filled with 'colabs' (and making it over complicated). In my opinion they're ruining the "battle royale" aesthetic of the game.
Ah fortinte.I love it
this is gonna be my first event 😄 Im so excited to buy the slim shady
Yeeeeeesss! Doctor whooooo!!!
Here we go again, epic really doesn’t know that we like the game goofy and simple 😢
I can’t believe will be able to bless the rains down in Fortnite
Can we please keep the loot from og it’s so much better and fun to use
On Fortnite Instagram they posted the live event a little the rocket will glitch out because of the Time Machine even the music will glitch as well
Well... They are also removing trading from rocket League sooooooo... One of the best features gone and multiple content creators main source of content gone too we win some we lose some.
I'm so excited for the doctor who colab I'm a big fan
This game is becoming too much like Roblox. A huge overstimulation simulator with way too many games and servers to keep up with. This isn’t why I put all the time and money into this game, I did all that for a battle royale with occasional new modes and creative maps, this is becoming too much for me.
Can you do a video on the back bling archive glitch
I think Fortnite is starting to become overwhelming for new players and me (I’m only 17 and was around during season 1 cap 1 Fortnite)
If yall haven't heard of linken park look him up and listen to his music. 👇
I just want wall running
Theres no way Lego would partner with fortnite
Is perks are coming back to ch5😮
ME
I love Fortnite again
Me😢
i hope next season is good
CM PUNK IS BACKKKK
I dont want the OG map to go pleaseeee......
I have a feeling Fortnite is gonna lose so many players next season
I cant wait for doctor who to enter fortnite. I cant wait to run around as David with a Unit gun or possibly a dalek gun yelling out EXTERMINATE! 😂😂 of course, im aware that the doctor doesnt use guns but anything is possible in fortnite
nah bruh, this can't be real. We must stop them
epic games going after the market share of some of the popular games ever, all at once:  (1) mario kart, with the fornite x rocket league game (2) minecraft, with the fortnite x lego game (3) rockband, with the fortnite rhythm game  bold strategy, cotton
I hope that Ninjago characters will be in the  Ego collab
Basically Fortnite’s way to bring back battle passes skins in the LEGO colab
Plus so many updates😵‍💫
So sad that season og is going away
I hope they don’t bring augments back also new locker is trash
I want the new locker gui it looks so cool
can't wait
Lost me at augments
3:50 THOMAS THE TANK IN FN!!!!!!!
I'm going to a party at 2
Y’all can not tell me that the character at 2:07 isn’t just penny without the bunny suit
theory that i know is probably never gonna occur:  So remember the golden light on the hill? well it appeared in season 6/7.  Season 6/7 was when the kevin island began to absorb the zero point from leaky lake  So my theory is that the golden light is the dormant gold cube form of the cube queen, and she’s waiting up on the hill with the entire last reality fleet hidden (most likely behind the portal like she made in C2S8 i think it was.  She’s waiting for the cube island to absorb the zero point, like how it is currently at leaky lake, and once the zero point is weak enough she will swoop in doing a full island assault and leading the main “cube cradle” over the zero point and sucking it inside of it. And then she just dips i guess and the island slowly dissolved and dies.
I can't want for doctor who colb so bad.
I’m even more excited
They should have added juice wrld not eminem
Ok. Seeing no comments about it here, a DW collab is SICK. I mean, come ON! TARDIS glider! Better have the Smith hanging out of it animations. I also hope they treat Tennant and Ncuti Gatwa well. This could very well be someone's first experience with DW, and as a massive fan of the show, my attention's gonna be split next Saturday with both a new special, and the live event, which could possibly feature the Doctor. I hope they do Psychic paper right too.
What about polka face? The wierd al version
I honestly wish the lego minifigure is in the battle pass and a acts like snap were you can customize his legs,arms,torsos and face.also I do wish it make lego building noises when building 😂
Not really a Eminem fan but that fedora/suit edit style lookin noice
Let’s not forget to give credit to the real hero, ifiremonkey 😂
Nobody talking about why the name is consequence? Also, keep up the good work top5 👍🏻!
I hope they add one piece in the game 🙏
Unpopular opinion or at least I think, but what can fortnite just go back to being Fortnite why does it have to be Minecraft then Roblox at home? Why does it feel the need to be every game? That’s why people love the OG season so much because it’s them going back to their roots in stead of being every game
What time? It’s gonna be the life event in Australia
jus keep the game simple
Plz don’t change the locker the main page is already horrible!
number 1 glazer
TBD is identical to Spider Gwen from the Miles Morales Animated Movie!
I am very excited for this, though, I was hoping for Chapter 2 to come back as that season was so nostalgic for me. Chapter 1 is also nostalgic for me but something about Chapter 2 hits different. I am honestly going to miss those seasons the most.
Me
5 hour gang ⬇️
What is the Lego man doing in the thumbnail
I had a blast playing the old map, i was a bit disappointed when there was no volcano or neo tilted but I guess been there done that.
I got chills💀💀💀💀
So no one piece calab😢
Dinosaurs
Kinda genius by Epic, having OG Fortnite to bring back a bunch of players like me, and us paying attention again and stuff may make us wanna give Chapter 5 a chance and try and keep playing.
nah imagine getting boxed by Lloyd and from a guy who likes his mom's spaghetti
I can make orange rhyme with banana bornana
Imagine saying you'd be able to crank as a lego figure in 2018💀
I'm so hyped
Me
fortnite bout to have the biggest drop off once og ends
Only music collaboration I care about it the Toto one
man i really thought i found a fortnite news channel without clickbait ass thumbnails
Rip me who have a family event in 12/2
Bro Minecraft gonna sue
Most hyped I’ve been for a new season since chapter 3
What happened to  7   and imagine odet on  chapter 5
what the heck is happening to Fortnite
I was thinking, if there is gonna be a railroad, and there will be an underground jonesy…THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD!
Me
Chapter 5 is looking to be a huge, game-changing experience and I'm beyond excited for all these new features, modes, and collabs (that Lego twist sounds ridiculously fun!).
Their doing this because chapter 5 is gonna be the last storyline update sadly
Love to see Lego in fortnite
I feel like fortnite should stop changing so much like what about the actual original game? Like this isint roblox
fortnite is becoming roblox with all these gamemodes bruh
Bro this thumbnail is crazy. A Lego guy and Eminem 😭😭😭
imagine if they brought the equalizer to fortnite
Right after my bday cool
Great won’t be able to play the event
Wow
If you started during chapter 2 we going back!!
yeah totally a competitor to Minecraft. For sure
Nobody
epic is actually trying to do too much🤦‍♂They can add stuff, yes, but they are adding too much and the things that they do add always have problems in the community and when they try to fix it nothing really changes.
I can’t wait for doctor who🎉
so for the lego thing is just save the world but in lego and in battle royal (but with more stuff and no zombies?)
Chapter 5 needs to last at least 2 years
It’s crazy how this month went by so fast I’m gonna miss this season 😔
I stopping the annoying bot comment said only top5gaming fan can comment
i wonder if the racing mode is actually just racing and with wheel support
of course we have to compare ANYTHING new in Fortnite to some other franchise like Mario Kart or Minecraft just let the game be
Postal Dude in Fortnite, anyone?
This seems too good to be true considering all the storqge going to be needed in a short period of time
Tbh u can’t beat minecraft story mode…
DOCTOR WHO!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT’S ACTUALLY HAPPENING!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s hope it’s not just a cutscene like the last one
thats a bass not a guitar goof!!
The wolverine claws is definitely for Deadpool 3 as he is a main character in it
All my fellas. Whos hyped 🗣️
Damn does anyone remember Minecraft dungeons 😢  👇
I ain’t going to let a Lego figure crank 90’s on me
POV: we all forgot about first person mode
For festival mode they should add slipknot
Try warthunder
Always the best tommy. One of the things I look forward to
that map doesnt look lie chapter 2
T5g your actually the goat man 🫶🏻
It looks like qwen stacy and the king pin.
my dad works for fornite about the music stuf remember this: project glamour
What if Brutus is the scientist
I‘m ready to leave fortnite forever After that season ends cuz this game gets worse and ugly
For the crossover skins like Star Wars, because they already have their own games in those characters are in those games, the better add those designs to Fortnite for the lego mode
Bro Fortnite won’t stop cooking
I hope i can use my nintendo cars in fortnite
"Completely Original Skin"  bro thats just gwen stacy. 😅😅
i hope the big bang will be replayable for those who cant get on at the time listed. and for chapter 5 i hope they give us more locker preset slots, ik its minor but it would be nice
i am not excited for this, in MY opinion it is way too much but the event should be fun
just let us play regular fortnite man😢
I hope that this music mode includes metal songs in the future, there could be Metallica since they did a collab last year but I want to some more big bands like Megadeth and Pantera
I hope they have mythics
The wolverine gloves update could be for Deadpool 3 which comes out next year in which Hugh Jackman has his big return as Wolverine.
ok
Nah Fortnite gotta extend og season to January or February
You didn’t warn me
they are  doing to much now
cool, but i hate the rocket league part. fortnite players get something, rocket league players just get trading removed
I really think Epic is trying too much at once. They really need to slow down and focus on BR. That's what we all came for
Check Out Box Fight PVP! (Code): 2204-8081-5936
top5gaming please don't clickbait your the best youtuber👍
This gonna be the worst one next lol 😂
since fortnite is making their lego mode like minecraft why not they add servers for you to join
They better ad helicopters because a man has fallen in to the river
ADD BACK THE TWIN MAG SMG
why isn't the lego colab its own GAME. seems strange to tie it to fortnite when it essentially has all the features of a fully functional game.
looking at the old chapter 2 map, I realize how small those mountains are. So sad they scuffed the og map
Unpopular opinion: now that we've played fortnite og for a while after all these years, i realized that new fortnite isnt that bad and lets face it, the beginning of each new chapter just hits different because everything is different and the music is amazing the first season.
god i am WAITING for a doctor who collab where you have a bunch of the doctors faces as selectable skins or style edits he can use different sonic screw drivers as his pickaxe and lets not forget his tardis now there are scenes of him falling out of it by only holding onto it from the open door that could be made an animation for his glider like him fumbling around trying to hold on because he cant be inside of it since that would be pay to win but cmon you cant tell me you don't wanna see the doctor trick shotting you in final circle
I’m not gonna be there on the live event 😭
My PS4 has been broken throughout the entire season. Hopefully i can play season 5.
how is the switch gonna handle all of that
they should keep the og map as a ltm and have each season rotate every week
What if they added The Galaxy Railways to fortnite which would mean flying trains with guns.
Not me
I love rap and Eminem, and then I listen to all their songs
Great, now Fortnite is becoming even more of a clusterfuck.
The new train better not be a remix of Apex Legends' train.
im jus saying the rhythm game mode would be 10x better with custom songs
Guitar:bonnie Microphone:freddy Rubber duck:chica Thats what I think
The amount of censors in the event with Eminem is gonna be crazy.
Yeah but not one piece
Literally everyone at my school is talking about Fortnite when they literally probably joined this season… and they act like they played since the beginning also btw season og is its own chapter the game specifically says that but people don’t listen and call it chapter 4 season 5 just cmon man listen to the game
I'M PUMPED!
cod players bout to go crazy on zero build
Make sure to get in as many games as possible before the season ends or else you may never be able to play on the island again
my birthday on the 2nd :D
OMG LEGO LAD IN THE THUMBNAIL
It’s been almost 2 years since the tanks were in the game?!
im sorry i saw the doctor from doctor who if  they are added im quitting
Loved GUITAR HERO AWESOM
no FAMILY GUY HAHA KIDDING BUDDY
Omg chapter 5. I thought OG season was the end.
on god fortnite wants to become roblox
I hate collabs but this sounds sick But overwhelming  And Fortnite is fortnite Not every single other game in history of gaming At least it’s good collabs but still They need to calm down with the updates No one likes the techy stuff or the T ratings since the point of Fortnite is to kill people  and Fortnite itself is rated T
If they just keep it simple, Remove poi ai and guards and all that stuff, remove boss's and mythics you get from killing them. Remove the random music that'll play at poi's, and go back to the simplicity of the OG setting of land and fight other players it'll keep way more players. There's just too much going on on the new chapters
I'm excited for the future of this game but I'm upset knowing I'll be the only one who will love it since everyone just wants to stay in OG
Literally the biggest downgrade this world is gonna see, NoahsNoah is predicting it
How the hell is lego gonna collab with fortnite when they don’t like military related things
Well it was nice playing Fortnite OG. See ya
about to set a record for the most players lost
What I took from this video: I'm gonna have lightning McQueen in Fortnite 0:50
The box pvp map IS AMAZING but theres lots of bugs i spawn on the roof ?
The event starts when my milk in my fridge expires 🥛
new theroy! trains in chapter five = thomas the train = fortnite x thomas the train
It’s amazing how the sheeple look the other way without realizing it. “But it’s just a game and it’s fun” Yeah, I almost forgot. Just a game… that tows an ideological line… and also removed police cars three years ago because “the police are bad and hurt feelings.” And now they’re showcasing Eminem, a man who used to be antiestablishment , among other things, but now tows the line as well.
This is too much. I wish they would just focus on making br as fun as possible instead of all this.
Jk
I just got off the box fight map 💀💀
If they have the doctor skin I will be very happy nice Christmas present
Is these like the family guy leak?
This isn’t Fortnite😢
POV You birthday is the day of the live event
Idk bro
looks like i’m quitting after og 😭
Are you think it’s coming in Fortnite?  juice wrld
Imagine being a Nintendo switch player.  Just the switch-📈📈📈💣💥
Someone better get Dragonforce for the rhythm type game. I wanna shred that damn guitar!
6:58 the worst gun in cod
Guitar, mic, duck...?
why would fortnite add slots next to your mats for attachments when there's a whole bunch of slots right under your crown and above your ammo that are completely useless
me
When is he coming  juice wrld Fortnite  I don't when know if he's coming
We need the dr who collab asap not stupid invincible
The Lego mode seems like an entirely new game
Lego is a kids toy company and fortnite is for teens so I'm confused
This is cool and all but does anyone else want them just to keep it simple. That’s the main reason I liked og
Who else won’t be playing fortnite anymore once the season ends
Then re adding wolverines claws could be to colab with insamniacs wolverine game there making
Is swimming coming back?
Please tell me he just said lego cave
2:58 "numb by Linkin Park" YEEEEEEEEEES
Doctor who is waiting
Let’s goooooooooo linkin park can finally be played can’t wait to see what the guitar one is like considering I play guitar
cant wait
Am I the only one that is a bit overwhelmed by all the stuff they are adding?
I don’t think this is smart on epic’s part. I, as well as many others, play fortnite for the BR. If I wanted to play something like minecraft, a racing game, ir rhythm game, I would get off fortnite and load something else up. I wish they put all these resources into making the main game as good as possible. The new map doesn’t even leave a good impression. We’ll have to play on it of course but ch3 map is still my favorite gameplay wise
W
Can’t let us enjoy og Fortnite Christmas:(
remember when this was just a battle royale game
If you think they doing too much 👇
Wait small question, the rocket league racing mode and the lego open world mode will be temporary modes?
I think some of these things are kind of dumb and more like combining all the popular games into Fortnite.
hi
The Lego collab looks insane
Live event just gonna be a long advertisement 😭
I thought they quit ruining the game but i was wrong they are making the game trash
👇Claim your 2h club here
But next season will be dope
I will miss this season
I love you bro your content is dope
Love the vids ❤
I just hope it is an end event and not a concert
Hply cow
So they’re gonna rip off rocket league and minecraft in 2 weeks? 😤
Where's my skin?
Man so much is coming for Fortnite now
that girl skin is spider woman
one collab they should do would be GTA5 / GTA6, with the trailer for the new gta coming in the first few days of december i hope we'll expect a collab soon
tbh who the hell is gonna play lego mode in Fortnite
Who saw t-pose midas?😅
I am it’s fun
bro, t5gs thumbnails be like chatgpt generated images 💀
I want a lol gun that does 1 damage but has aimbot and a slow fire rate
Bouta be the worst fortnite update in history
Love the videos T5G! Keep it up!  This is going to be so lit! Can’t wait to get my hands on lego drift if he is released.
I guess that Gwen stacty is part of Rocket league now its confirmed by T5G (a little mistake that he did, but keep up the GREAT work T5G I love your content!)
at this point its a race between fortnite and roblox to make ready player one
They missed a huge operation to make the link in park song “in the end” I think that would have been 🔥
your map is really good t5g I play it all the time with my friends
This chapter might be the end of Fortnite look what happened to call of duty mobile
I will miss go Fortnite because my favourite battle pass skin was renaged lynx
Nooooooooooooooooooo
2:08 Qwen
All of my friends are mad that Eminem has three skins but honestly I don’t care because of how cool they are🤟
Are they copping cod
Fact number 11 is literaly just minecraft which means... MINECRAFT MODE is bassically here!!!
Mabye the Wolverine claws files could be for a Deadpool 3 collab in 2024
Fortnite event leak: rocket takes off but before it cracks the sky like before it teleports away and then Eminem will appear and start rapping, suddenly he turns into a Lego man and shouts “Hey!” Like the Lego advert, then suddenly he turns into lightening McQueen and raps some more this is when the rocket re appears and destroys the map again
why did i think the jonesy skin what joseph joestar
Well, it was good while it lasted
WHERE THE HELL IS ONE PIECE COLLAB
Make this the most liked comment
I can’t wait for Eminem in fortnite to sing slim shady
fortnite doing too much bruh
It's not gonna be fall guys it's going to be bean guys
No i will i want og fortnite so much i had to go on vacation and missed two and a half weeks of playing
I want it!🔥 But I also don't want the old settings to be gone its not really Fortnite anymore
What is next a PvPvE mode?  Edit: I meant like an extraction shooter type of mode if anyone got confused.
Next weekend is gonna be big
Let’s hope it’s not unforgettable for all the wrong reasons * cough cough* Fracture
1 hour gang
SCIENTIST VISITOR AND THE ORGIN COMING BACK!!!!!!
Probaly quitting after the event
Wow Just Wow...
I feel like the "new skin" for the npcs in the event looks eerily similar to Gwen Stacy from Earth-65 ( I think that's her reality l )
I've never had fun playing Fortnite solos after addition of bots . The first couple of kills you get are always bots if you don't land in any crowded poi . And after you kill bots and a real cracked player like Justin comes ,we are bound to take it easy but that ends up in misery .  I wish they remove the bots so that we gain momenum after every single elimination
My switch isn’t gonna handle this
so the lego mode will be save the world lego edition?
“Completely original outfit”- looks like Gwen
This is not Fortnite this is an entire new game!
last live event was total ass and im not a fan of slim shady 😢
I bet that the Lego skin is like to on fish or any other skin that you can customize everything
prox chat would be cool
David Tenant is gonna be here?
LEGO FISHSTICC?????????
I’m excited for trains
Lego means play well in a language I forget what it is tho
2:54 XD what do you have against Alice Cooper? I mean somewhat joking but there's 5 things and you read out 4, like I get if there were 50 and you gave 4 examples, but 4 out of 5...
The train station is the race car factory and the dirt path is a dirt race track it’s obvious
Gonna miss og
Not me
If they're doing a collab with Lego they might as well do it with Minecraft am I RIGHT
Bro what if fortnite did "drive" collab 💀💀💀
I like Lego but in fortnite????
I’m honestly gonna miss Fortnite OG! Playing for the first time (I started in Ch3) felt like a whole new map and I absolutely loved it
Doctor who the hell
Can't read my can't read my no he can't read my pokaa face
Looks like Naker Mayfielld
i cant wait to see a lego banana get killed by a lego tomato
Does anyone else agree that in the box fight pvp map the kills should save
Bro I’m gonna be so sad when this ends😥
I don't know why but I had goosebumps hearing what Fortnite is becoming next week.
I swear to God I hoped for a train track with a train that moves all match that has better loot when you get closer to the middle of it.   Imagine the epic fights lol
I am super excited for when that doctor who collab arrives
If imma be honest we don’t need attachments for the guns
cant wait to crank 90s as wild style
Borrenana
Just go play rocket league 😂
Small thing, but am i the only one to notice the battle bus im the Big Bang teaser is the Chapter 4 battle bus?
Imagine dragons is on of the best singer for me and im glad that it made to fortnite🎉🎉❤❤
Are we going through the rifts the rocket went through from OG fortnite
cant wait for the bigbang :DDDDDDDDD so many stuff goin happin
I'm hypeddd
idc, im only 15 and my dad passed away. His services are satetday. Only if one life mattered to epic they would make in sunday
T5G I got news fortnites battle pass has Harry Potter, king shark, genos and someone else so its just news for you
1 hour gang👇
A gun thats been Vaultedd for almost two years...  Man Ch3 s2 old now  😥
OG was fun, but I'm bored with it already.  Ready for something new, and this looks like a ton of stuff to sink my teeth into.  Feed it to me!!!
WELL THIS BE ON CONSOL TOP FIVE GAMING ALL  THE  CLABS.
Hot take: fortnite should focus on making the main br mode more fun and not too massive of a change from og instead of focusing on a ton of other modes
I’m Gonna Miss OG Fortnite ngl But I’m hyped for Chapter 5
I’m honestly scared that br is gonna be left behind with all of these other modes taking up epics attention
its going to be like 500gb
them transfering you rl cars to fort is a big W
amazing map and boxfight map
Chapter 5 is going to be lit
tommy sounds like he would be good at rapping
If they arent gonna focus on battle royale they mght as well let us pick what map we want to play on and just let us play on that
Maybe the Wolverine Claws being added are there for Deadpool 3 and we’ll get a Ryan Reynolds Deadpool skin & a Hugh Jackmen Wolverine skin
wtf is fortnite anymore...?
BRO, I play on ps5 and I lost my update for the Big Bang event so I am desperate for my update to come back
I really hope I can recreate sets in the new Lego mode. Specially the UCS Venator.
O
i love box fight  pvp
since chapter 5 is all about like collabs and different universes I hope they bring back the marvel mythics and bosses
Fortnite is gonna become even more unplayable on switch I bet lol. All these new modes are gonna take up a couple more gigs of storage, meaning that switch players might not even be able to download the game without an extra MicroSD card, which sucks. Had a good run I guess
The zero point is getting destroyed more often then the time i got a victory royale
Top 5 gaming is such a good channel he always informs me about my favorite childhood game Fortnite so I just wanted to say thank you Tommy
Memememememememememememememememe
I don't want to sound negative, this is all really cool and all but... if we can have all that, lego and guitar hero games and what not, can we please keep the chapter 1 map as a gamemode or something?
Bro they adding way to much
The event is going to be severely overshadowed by doctor who next week
fortnite about to fall off 💀
People who want to keep the OG map  👇
Within an hour gang ⬇️
Very nice, can't wait for the event! I hope the battle pass will be nice, and not trash as always as it has been, for the last years...
6:58 DUDEEEEEE I wish that Fortnite and Apex would collaborate. Like imagine fighting on Worlds edge or Olympus!!!
Helloooooo
no family guy?
Love your video Top5gaming and keep up the great work you are awesome
Linkin park in Fortnite!!!! They better add a skin
Fun fact: Jug band plays Poker face if you get everyone so technically Lady Gaga was already in fortnite since Chapter 3 season 3
top5 really the goat channel 🐐
wasnt among us and rocket league cars enough? no? 4 MORE CROSSOVERS?!?!?!?!
Well this event can’t be worse than fracture
Okay wow Fortnite is doomed. This stuff seems good but I’m already calling it nobody is sticking around for long once this drops.
Hi
I think were forgetting the fact that og season is literally ending in 7 more days 😭😭
Copying Mincraft is crazy bro make a new game
Mark my words this live event will be worse than the fracture event
epic is doing 2 much stuff i dont like it
this is way too much
3:09 **Rap god plays** The guy on vocals: 💀
0:56 thats a bass
Streamers gotta do the pistol only challenge for Em 😆
Lego mode the Minecraft killer?
why do I feel like the lego mode is gonna be just Save the World but better? rub in more salt in the wound that they've fully abandoned the pve mode
4:40 WOW you really think someone will play your map AFTER YOU SPREAD MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE FNAF COLLAB AND DONT DOCUMENT YOURSELF
Fortnite will never compete with Minecraft ever MCC FOR LIFE
stop ruining ur game and originality, og Fortnite please
Wild
YAYAYA
Fortnite x Lego = Minecarft (LOLLL)
it makes sense for epic to first do the og season to get more players and then completely changes a lot. I think this is a masterplan
Man I’m sad I have school on Friday
All of this just doesn't feel like Fortnite
Crazy
Hey T5G back in 2021 there was a leaked image about Fortnite Open world with mini characters like Jonesy and Fish stick with weapons is that still a thing.
I feel like Fortnite is just turning in to a mobile app of just a bunch of different games😢
ngl epic messed up for putting the live event on a school day
Next month are even going to play the Fortnite that we feel in love with so long ago, cause they might as well make a new game
the loocker redesign looks awfull
Top g gaming
the ch5 map looks like rust
Trains need to get in to Fortnite and the map is going to be big
I'm excited for the Doctor Who collab
this will be cool and all but fortnite starting to lose its origins and turn more into a roblox the a br
I don't want the season to end😭
0:56 💀💀💀 Fnaf has left the chat Scott has entered t5g house with a gun
Epic games has really similar lobby as cod anddcod hired netflix guy if you ask me these type of lobbies are just ugly
1:24 oh yeah i’m there i’m waiting
0:56 WORST YOUTUBER EVER BRO THATS FNAF PLS DOCUMENT YOURSELF
1 hour gang
those mini passes for events are honestly stupid. you pay more than a regular pass to unlock it yet has less tiers than even the og pass. honestly the people mad at the og pass should look at those mini even passes.
0:56 BRO💀💀💀 T5G DOESNT EVEN DOCUMENT HIMSELF BEFORE MAKING A VIDEO THAT FNAF
they actually need to stop changing the ui. the locker looks great, but the discovery tab hurts my soul every time i play the game
hi top5gameing i tried your map and its realy fun
Fortnite is going to suck again
They better not remove or stop support for stw when the lego collab comes out
I think the twist in the end is GENO because he spawned back in the end of the comic and he was in a different map/place telling by the background and he deserves a skin in the battle-pass bro singlehanded the whole seven and the Avengers bro deserves a better.   But hey that’s just a Theory
Bro fortnite is just trying to be everything. Next thing you know we’re going ti have an official zombies mode. Oh wait we have that well what about a story mode. Oh we also have that so i guess next chapter fortnite will be everything
The microphone looks like Freddy fazbears
Fortnite, please don’t lose the simplicity of the game😢
0:56 PLS T5G YOU MADE HERE A VERY VERY BIG MASTAKE COME ON YOU CANT EVEN DOCUMENT YOURSELF BEFORE MAKING A VIDEO THATS FNAF NOT MUSIC THAT A REFFERNCE TO FNAF NOT TO MUSIC
Me
I love how they show Minecraft Story Mode when the compare FN Lego to MC, glad people never forgot that gem.
The anvil gets to come out but not the giddied missoe luncher
They should revamp augments so we get them randomly either in chests or after a certain amount of elims
can't wait to ride around in sweet tooth's ice cream truck if they're porting our rocket league inventory
Fuc
only theory but the big bang is also possibly gonna add big bang theory i doubt it tho
Maaan wheres family guy man 😂
Not me it’s boring I want chapter 2
Lego night
im gonna miss the event or be sleepy because its in 2am in my country when its happening
Lego Fortnite Minecraft? What on earth...
Thanks So Much T5G!!  These videos are really helpful
This new season looks Marvelous
The kills don’t save in your map, bs
3:44 I remember people saying this same thing back in chapter 2, hopefully there is a train this time
That locker 🤮
The 6.1K like.
Not the first time Fortnite tried to outdo minecraft. Time to see them fail again
When we lose the og map Fortnite's gonna beat the record of most players lost in a day
First 30 min
Imagine Fortnite did collab with The Big Bang Theory. I would be ready to spend 20$ to crank 90's with Sheldon and going like "Actually the legendary assault rifle is SCAR L that's short from Special Operations Forces Combat/Capable Assault Rifle Ligth designed in Belgium 2004 and produced by FN Herstal. It uses 5.56×45mm NATO cartriage and is able to fire 500 rounds in minute" (yes i did research) 🤓☝
they finally can collaborate with cars with a lightning mcqueen skin
Damn if all those tandom stuff will be added again i might just retire from fortnite again. And i'm sure i'm not the only one
It's gone by too fast 😢
They already had a crossover with fall guys
I’m going into the event with super low expectations but it sounds just as disappointing as fracture
Im just saying, this game is dying... and it pains me to say it... im worried for competitive because everything is gonna be rng i feel like
that tw octane gon' be flexing in 2 games now 😈
Nobody
fortnite lego is just a ripoff of roblox and minecraft lol
👇Under 1 hour gang👇
Nah bro that was rocket  Waite Gwen Stacey who is wiht mw
Tommy please read this. Eminem has a song called Godzilla and since epic owns the right to this and the monster is gone, and since there is going to be no mech cause no volcano, and juice world was in the teaser vid I think Godzilla will fight the monster
Woah!
Let’s hope it’s not unforgettable like fracture
I’m here so the top comment, isn’t  people who don’t come from TikTok can like this comment💀💀
noice
Lego collab is going to be so funny, ive seen a few concepts by people and it looks hilarious, i love how Epic is branching out to all these avenues, brings a new flavour to the game
Thats actually a bass, not a guitar. I wonder if that's hinting towards something?
The railroads aret a surprise.. since fortnite released monopoly back bling in the recent past
Pls fortnite, make a fnaf colab
What if you could hijack the train?
On December 2 I am going to have 2 feelings happy and sad happy because the Big Bang and sad because Fortnite Og is gone

What about avenged sevenfold coming to Fortnite?!?!

The live event happens on my birthday day
i feel like i am going to be really disappointed.
minecraft story mode...
I hate how fortnite is good, but the menu isn’t anymore
There is a duck for Chica, a guitar for Bonnie, and a microphone for Freddy, so is there a potential FNAF collaboration?
I feel like the warm climate should be in the south and the cold mountains in the north
Am excited for the Fortnite live event and I’m still hoping for a crossover of Mortal Kombat.
Seems a bit much but hopefully its good
Why does TBD look so much like Gwen Stacey from spider across the spider verse
bass guitar!?!?!?!
I'm early boi
Where's the Chug Jug with you emote??? Is it coming to the battle pass?
A yeat concert would go crazy😭
It seems like the event is yet another creative experience, not much exitement on my end, back when they did something live on the map to watch, those were cool
Use Code T5G
BRUTES IS COMING YES LETS GOO! love it keep up the work Top5!
COME ON ALL THIS AND NICK EH 30 still don’t have a skin
I just wanna play BR like bro 💀💀
I hope the whole chapter 5 map is just coral castle
Hmm, chapter 2
Its always a great day when T5G Posts videos
What time is the event in UK time
UwU
Bro why are people saying that is looks like chapter 2 it literally has ZERO similarities
People who think this season is a FAT DUB  👇🏼
Ive been waiting for an entire year until the next event and cant even attend this one😢😢😢
I’m excited for what’s tocome
I hope they make real life fortnite lego sets
The first thing I thought when I saw the background for the main menu area and the giant Llama in the galaxy was tengen toppa gurren lagann
Battle pass vid pls
Tbh the emeinem kinda looks like sterling
The map is so tiny compared to chapter 2
you r good
95% chance it’ll be called Fortnite 2 not a new chapter
He deserves an icon skin

Imagine Eminem is the scientist
Idk what to say man
This video is getting me hyped!
20 min
I'm so excited for the new mode.
Where did you get this footage?
U mean a year and a half. Fractures not an event that was a creative tutorial
im bout to make a red eye silencer pump
I was gonna say 1 hour gang but realised I had a brain
If I report a bot does that mean it gets banned?
Lightning mcqueen gonna go crazy if they get permission to add to the rl racing mode.
ALLONS-Y, ALONSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
What is this chapter 5 start first person, basically fnf finally another live event and also doubles as a concert Lego collab rocket league collab like
rainbow road
what time will the live event be in australia?
Man skipped fucking alive cooper??!!
Hate these collabs. Want original skins in the battle pass again that fits the season theme. Felt more genuine
Legos actually gonna come I know there's something in the background of the loading screen in the background of the screen
Hold on. If we have gone back in time to chapter 1, does that mean The Cube Queen and The Herald are alive?
Who remembers when Fortnite used to be a battle royal / survival game
Not yet...😢
nice to see lego worlds getting some associated attention. loved that game
Bring back chacter 2
no
Why does the racing outfit look identical to Gwen Stacy from SATS
Bro Eminem is gonna be in the battle pass
Weapon mod!!!!
poker face by eric cartman or just normal poker face
Let’s only take a moment to appreciate how many bots are in the comment? It's unbelievable, and I think they deserve a lot less than that
they have to change is broooo I have school😭😭😭😭😭
I quit fortnite to many sweats
The Doctor will drop in lego dimensions style. I want it to happen.
wait... is that MONKET D> LUFFy????

If epic is gonna go through with the weapon attachments I don't think I'll play it
I only trust t5g for Fortnite info
They really need to make live events last two days so people have time to make it
Lego collab is lame as hell
lego collab looks like a trove but lower quality lol
Finally trains
Okay. The part that caught my attention was the Linkin Park part. I grew up listening to them since I was a little kid, and Chester Bennigton has been my idle since. We might have lost him in 2017, but my dream was to have him immortalized in some way, and now that he is going to be in Fortnite. I am so excited. I hope we can get a Chester Bennigton and Mike Shinoda skin at some point even. Linkin Park forever ❤
WTF does wannabe gangster Eminem have to do with Fortnite? Nothing. Every Hollywood narcissist wants they pretentious self inserted as a skin now. Hard pass on that skin.
Winter fest
Still waiting for Doctor Who!

Hi
PLEASE LET CHAPTER 5 SEASON 1 BE SCIENCE THEMED
Great, so within the span of 2 months they're going to save and ruin their game. Just sit back and admire the work you have done. I really think they should go back to the OG map season 1-3 and start over. They can easily act as if this event went wrong and they are restarting, then just take a separate path from the one they took.
Bro this is crazy
