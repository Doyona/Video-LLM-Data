I think hilliberg don't have to worry about this one.😂
Hoping your health is better 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤
Always love you ❤️
1:05   Only a werewolf surveying lunch...
Mr fox is magnificent
If I were you id wear a trucker hat, fake mustache and blare country music while campin
I'd feel very exposed in a bright red tent ⛺️  My god what was that creature i heard at the beginning yikes
Your patience and dedication are to be admired. Did a lot of camping in my younger days, if I had to fight to set up the tent like you did I would have just left it there and went home... 😂😂😂
The daring capers you indulge in artistic stealth warrior.do you think men will be kicked out or be your helpers or work in libraries or open gates or cheer lead you. All you ladies beautiful young and something happened eventually.
This appears to be a one person tent.  I would like to know the dimensions of this. Also it might be good for children, if they could set it up.
Your tent reminds me of the tent I had my whole childhood from maybe 11 or so. $20 Ozark Trails Walmart tent, similar size and construction but it was blue and we put many years on it and I think it was left in the house in the attic when my Mom sold it. Was like new after years of minimum Monthly camps and the back yard and  other camps and it was just enough for one person even though it was advertised as a 2 man tent. May have been earlier though as I remember it being on Church trips too. So late 80’s $20 was like $100 now so I guess it wasn’t a cheap tent but it was on the low end even of the day.
It will stand out like a beacon like rudolf the raindear.  Try this one by milltech einmann recom zelt.   Mill tech one man recom tent.  Comes in many types of camo pattern olive green , dbp and others.  Weighs about 2 kg or so easy to put up.
If you have a small (red, blue, green, yellow) tent..  you then need a large tarp, to go over it.. the larger the tarp the dryer it will be around the tent, and can add some storage of a dry space.. and as well the tarp can be sloped to add protection if rain is coming from one direction.. most rig them between tree's to have an A frame to be roped/pegged at corners. As well if the tarp is green or camo, it will hide it.
I would have made a frame of sticks and then piled the Leaves on the Frame of sticks..... It looks like a Childrens backyard Play tent.....
❤️❤️❤️👋😁
what difference would painting it with Fabsil make to waterproof it?
So, I should leave my high power, wide lens birdwatching telescope at home?
Good review,  you get what you pay for. I’m 6’4” and never fit in there I guess 😊
Reminds me of my  first time  camping at a bike show. Mate said he'd bring a spare tent as i hadn't got one yet.  He threw me a tent shaped bag as he unloaded the beer ( prioritise) but when i unwrapped it  i noticed it was red and yellow with the words 'Fisher Price' on it. He'd picked up his sons tent by mistake.   Thankfully im only 5" 5' tall so only my boots ( or head ) stuck out when sleeping , after enough beer, i didn't care.  Love your videos.  Thanks.
if you have a single skin tent, you have to make a nice gap between the bugmesh, and the tent material at the entrance, because the bugmesh is the inlet of the ventillation, and the top mesh is the outlet of the air. I used a single skint tent for a long time, and kept a blown up simple plastic bag between the two layers of the entrance. It made a nice gap, and the air was able to flow through the tent.
I used this tent and I am 5ft10. I thought it wouldn't rain but it rained BOTH NIGHTS heavily. I bought a better tent after this :).
That was amazing. When you put your blue hoody on it, it disappeared! ;-)
The most adorable Lady on youtube. 😉
THANK YOU this tent has stressed me out so much trying to set it up solo 😂 your method has worked better than any I’ve seen so thank you
Yeah just get undressed throw all your clothes on the tent works for me.   Wait I dont look like you...
Oh my. The terrible plastic bag noise. 😂
Hmm.. i wonder why this is the most replayed part 6:04 😂i mean guys... she married with kids, come on... Sure.. she brings great ass-sets's 😉 in terms of content, but..no pun intended,  keep it together will you😂.
Great 🥧 video love d it ❤
do you still car camp in your landrover.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🚙⛺️
I like your tent very nice
You should get some camofloge netting
The fox wasn't fooled by the camojob
Just splosh some white paint dots all over and become a shroom 😮
In Predator rather than a greenscreen suit, as it was all in the jungle, they had the Predator wear a bright red suit when filming the invisibility effects.. as it was the opposite to green. That tent sticks out more than anything 😅
You laying low reminded me of when i'd lay low hiding from the cops when i ran away from home and when i stuck my head back up i was like arnie at the end of predator just covered in mud but they never found me. I even lost the dogs some how. I was gone for 2 days making sure to hide and fish in obscure locations and when it came to sleeping i'd just lay on the ground covering myself with leaves or lumps of grass which makes for a good pillow and blanket not that i'd recommend it.  When i went back home i snuck in put my school uniform on and went to school as if nothing happened it was a fun weekend of hide and seek.  It won't come as a shock when i say me and my mother didn't and still don't have the best relationship but she is a single mum of 3 2 when i ran away and i will defend her against anyone who says lone parents should have better control over their kids.
3:43 there is so much grass there. Why not  over it without grass?
Had an American moment and wondered why on Earth your tent weighed 21 pounds…. Then it clicked 🤦🏻‍♂️
I hiked around Europe for a year with a 12 euro Chinese tent. It held up in snowstorms at minus 23 celcius hail and heavy rain. 20 years later I still have it as a souvenir. Great channel
Trevligt ❤❤❤❤
You and Steve are the coolest stealth mofos around. Very nice
Your tent looks too small for me! Thank you for sharing.
Def not a 2 person tent.
Use an ex agricultural fertiliser bag as a rucksack liner. It can then be used to store your rucksack and surplus gear outside the tent at night. Check it out for holes which can be patched with tiny squares of duct tape.
Sleep diagonally in a small tent. It gives you a tad more room.
Put the clips on last, it's easier.
You look like fun to hang with!🤗
AlL you need to purchase to hide your red tent is some military camaflauge netting
Stealthy camping in a bright red tent. 🤔🙂 Still, you made it work 👍.   Condensation, always a big problem in single skin tent's. Still   what do expect in a cheap  tent ⛺ 🤣
I'm not a fan of bright colored camping tents or tarps either.
That is a festival tent, suitable for one drunk person or two on top of each other.
Imagine doing that set up in the rain I’ll give that tent a miss great video though as always 😊
That was cool the way it flattened so quickly. I like how birds especially thrushes, tits and crows can alert you to the presence of people or other animals.
You make me happy when I watch you doing what you do thankyou for doing these videos 👍
Tent is made for stealth camping in strawberry field. Maybe!?
Can of spray paint might stealth it up lol
stealth ...? you just want to get klicks  horribel  :-(
For £20 and being small I suppose it’s a reasonable backyard tent for the kids to play with
💞💞🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🦋🦋
Place your tarp over the top.
one hell of a tent to put up got one myself 👎
thank you that put a huge smile on my face.
The way youtube shows the most replayed parts of the video is enlightening to say the least.
Classic festival tent, i did many a Reading fest back in the day in one of these.
I heard the intro before I read the title and thought: "that's one heavy tent!"
3:15  Not joking when I say that the Amazon link to the tent describes it as a two person tent.
Cool 👍
If the red does not give you away, the crinkling sound will.
I love your videos but I've noticed a trend that you try to set up pitch in areas where you won't be seen. Can you talk a little more about that as a solo woman camping / hiking? I will be going on my first overnight this weekend and I'll be with my dog, but there will be hikes where I won't be able to bring her. I'd love to hear more about how you stay safe as a woman and what types of things you look out for before deciding to pitch tent or even what types of trails to look out for when hiking with the intention to pitch a tent! <3 Thank you for all the value you bring!
excellent wall
Just found your videos.  A beautiful woman who loves camping.  Wow!
I'm only at the place where you struggled to get the pole through the black loop.. but surely you could have just taken that section off the main pole, slip it through and reattatched the section of pole to the rest once it was through the loop?
I had a Coleman tunnel tent me and the missus use for low-key glamping that broke a couple of pole segments during a really bad storm a couple of years ago. We had the same problem struggling to get the front poles in the base clips - poles seemed a little too long. So when I replaced the broken fiberglass sections at the front of the tent, I cut them a couple of millimetres shorter, which made a world of difference when erecting the tent the next time we used it.
So adorable this girl. Like a bubbly favourite niece
Reminds me of the really cheap tents we had growing up. $20 but they were blue. Big enough for 1 person, their sleeping bag and backpack or whatever you hauled your stuff in on. I had one for years while I was a Boy Scout and it was durable and held rain out well. These were probably longer, 6’ maybe. Ozark Trails.
I bought one of those and camped in it over the weekend at the MotoAmerica races in Shelton Washington, one I got was orange but same size everything the same, fit on my motorbike well.. worked great!    however tents no matter the size NEED TOP AND BOTTOM VENTILATION!  to prevent the condensation from collecting inside and allowing fresh air to circulate, made sure mine was nice and dry before rolling up, easy to turn inside out, I left the door zipper cracked
great video .
i think these kind of '2 man' tents are marketed towards the festival crowd
Whats a telly bug? Something like a doodle bug?
Hi Claire, have you ever tried those instant tents? I used mine when I did my road trip to Yellowstone National Park. I loved my tent. It goes up in minutes, wind proof and rain resistant. I always valued your opinion.
Pod3s. Poner subtitulos en español
Great video,  great little tent too. I have to agree with you about its color. A bit bright and seeable.   It seemed to work really well in any event 👍  I loved seeing the Red Fox, so cool.
Why don't you have "Super Thanks" or "JOIN" buttons?  Are you already wealthy?  I really enjoy your videos.
I bought one of those tents for my nephew last week.
Very nice video. I was thinking about buying a similar tent, bet now ill have in mind the lengh of it.
and then the guy lines are neon color .. aiyoyo .. your videos are just so fun to watch ..
camouflage the area instead of the tent .. my sergeant see will kill me ah .. hahahaz .. you are soooo cute ..
Claire,   As I have said I love your accent.   May I ask where its from?  I love your videos and your honesty 	acknowledging your limitations.  Thank you.
Another great video Claire. i feel same with you about peaceful nature, I have enjoyed and I grateful for mother natures💖🏕🥰
❤
Youre brave doing this as a single woman.
Sometimes thr cheap Aldi/Lidl camping kit can b decent stuff i git a £15 2 man dome tent & solo xamped near a beach & was really good.. but not waterproof though... U GO GIRL...& Never listen to the cretins who write "oh a woman shouldn't b camping on her own" BLAHH BLAGH...u seem 2 really enjoy urself so..👍😸😸
Jens Williamson, III (Deaf)  You make me laugh when you are the champions mischief. I can't accept the stealth camping. The Red Fox love you so much. Lol 😂 You had fun, all right. You will know. Okay! Thanks for your time. Have a great day!  Respectfully,  Jens C. Williamson, III 😎😷👍🇺🇲 Bexar County! 🇨🇱 Retired ID Hearing Impaired The Disability!✅ (approved)  I prefer that I pay to Texas State Parks under TPWD for the camping so I can't get in trouble. 😊 I Worry Free!
Why the need to be stealthy? Are you not allowed to camp anywhere in the wild in the UK?
Me, an idiot American: "21 lbs doesn't sound very lightweight..."
When most folks see a tent pitched in a public park, they assume it’s a homeless encampment and will ignore it.  Only when attempting to stealth camp on private property or protected lands is someone likely to walk over and investigate.
Definitely a two-person tent, for honeymooners.😉💖
Talking about prity cute I was just thinking the same ❤
Sounds like that tent is made out of crisp packets. 🙉
I suspect you had a good teacher👍
Red is your color. Merry Xmas little elf.❤😊
As kids, me and a mate wanted to sleep out once overnight, had zero experience or gear, only thing we could find was an old pair of long green Curtains..our destination was a local golf course. We had a surprise late visitor, a random border collie sheep dog..who we named 'john the dog'. As bizzare the prep & scenario was, we completed the forst overnighter in dry, warm conditions. 'Jtd' disappeared as suddenly as his appearance.  Lesson learned: fun & spontaneity are important.
I recall reading about Swiss army camouflage using patches of red mixed in the camouflage patterns because at distance our minds have a "blind spot" perceiving red and that breaks the recognition of shapes
£21 tent, much loved by festival goers everwhere.
Chuckles at 'stealth camping'. In Scotland we just 'camp'.
I bought one of these cheap tents, it was all good on paper.  Putting up, nightmare.  Had the same trouble as you, but one pole shattered, left me with carbon fibre splinters.  Awful things.
When my son was about 5 he begged me to go camping I bought a tent similar to this and we both squeezed in at a camp site woke up freezing and pee wet through about 5am. Put him in back of my car wrapped in a blanket and chucked tent etc in boot and we drove home shattered. Tent got confined to garage never to be used again. I moved house about 15 years later and gave it to the young lad next door so he could use it in his garden ..his dad gave me a pint can of Stella a fair swap I reckon lol 👍🏻🍻
new binge watch argh many more togo
Love the content Claire, which part of the UK are you from btw ?
The red tent, about as stealthy as the Harley Davidson owners club going on a Sunday morning bike ride
I just think your beautiful 😍
Compared to your usual camping style this is a little bit different. But for anyone starting out, it’s gives an idea that for not very much money you can still have an adventure. It would be so easy for you to dismiss this tent and talk it down, but you didn’t. So well done. A good alternative video 👍
Hilarious finding that you did a review of this. I bought this at GoOutdoors and used it in Cornwall and Scilly last Summer. You're right about the nightmarish condensation but it did manage to get me through a pretty strong thunderstorm out on the Scillys. How, I don't know.😂Glad to see I wasn't the only one who had a bugger of a time trying to put the polls in. I also thought they were going to snap.And they're having a laugh calling it a TWO person tent. I'd wish there were two small mesh windows/flaps on either side. I think that would help with ventilation some. Otherwise you're just sleeping in a plastic bag. 😂 So funny seeing you give a test run of this circus clown of a tent.
You can get them for £14.99 now…
A thin water proof tarp for  vestibule
Claire wanted to have an « authentic cheap tent experience « .
With those cheaper (basically festival tents) you need to pin the corners down before putting the poles in.
I found an amazing woodland today private land but my goodness Im definitely going out making some tree House and underground shelters in there 🙂
Great video but a little part of me died when I saw this little MF in its full _glory_
Hi there are cheaper tents I have one
I'm sorry but that struggle was priceless
❤ I thought you would have preferred fleck tarn to bright bright red ?
I have camped in North Wales a few times in the past you are pretty safe apart from the sheep coming into your camp
Love the reverse psychology, Claire:  "This tent is so not camo that no one will suspect anyone is stealth camping here!"  😃  Actually, walkers on existing trails tend not to see too much at all, often being preoccupied with other things, although bright red is pushing the bounds of hope a bit! 😉    The real issue I find is not so much people, but their dogs, which are often off the leash and running all over the place exploring well away from the trails, sometimes quite early in the morning for those who go jogging before work, etc.    You idea of a lighweight camo net would work fine here, but your tree-branch and fern wall is perfect, and of a common appearance and texture to your surrounds.  The real giveaway for people is movement, the familiar human shape especially in silhouette, and atypical sounds, like cutlery on plates, mobile phones (a real curse), wood chopping, etc.  The other cues are the smells of smoke or cooking.  The military concealment regimen uses the rule of "avoiding all the S's". These are, in no particular order:  Silhouette, Shine, Shadow, Shape, Shade, Sound, Speed to which I would definitely add "Smell" - nothing is more of a giveaway than tobacco or fire smoke, toothpaste, aftershave or perfumes or (ugh) BO. In the bush, I've picked up people kilometres away on cigarette smoke or even old campfire smoke in their clothing and it's a good sense to practice once your nose is accustomed to the natural bush smells. Hint: always check your wind direction, too. It works both ways. Note also that in the above 8 characteristics, 5 of them are sight-related.  This will flesh out those subdivisions for  you:  https://stipsniper.com/2019/10/03/the-7-ss-of-camouflage/
That’s one tent for the kids in the back garden..👍🇦🇺
Set of wheels on that tent and it’d be good to go 🤣🤣
I enjoy your movies very much. But I have a question......is it illegal to camp there?
You could almost imagine it as one of the red Hillebergs. After a quart of whisky. Hope it wasn't your own 21 pounds.
5:50 I'd call that a screen rather than a mound.
World War Two book "Two Eggs On My Plate" has a section (with photos) on hiding a tent in a large shelter of branches and plant material.
The eurohike tamar 2 is about 30 quid (on sale) usually and is so much better for a cheap 2 birth tent. I had it in green but one of the pole eyelets was borked on arrival so i had to go with the red one instead. but tbh can totally recommend.
I can't stop laughing at you fighting with that tent pole 😂
My grandad loves watching your adventures
I love the way you exit your videos that is very unique. 😊
Your getting tougher.  21 snackers he.
youre bloody lovely. Thanks for the videos :D loving the channel
Another great video.  I recently discovered your channel and am viewing some of the older ones.    I own a large acreage parcel in Michigan.  Last year, I camped out on my own property with minimal gear.  I'm planning my next adventure as we speak.  Your videos are part of my inspiration.  Thanks for all you do.
嗓音非常棒🎉
Not bad for an affordable tent, the red colour is a bit loud! love the idea to build a wall to hide behind.
u look like woody out of toy story
It's a good tent for a few years. Then it will need seams retapping
Camping with China's finest specimen of outdoor shelter systems 👍 😂
These are currently on sale at go outdoors for £17 it's just a shame about the colour as this would make a great starter tent for a kid/teenager.
Yeah, not really stealth camping! When you first said 21 pounds, I thought you misspoke on its weight 😆
Looks like you need an accomplice
Are you sure you're not a bloke? You have balls of steel 😂
Great tent review. I can't wait to see more of your videos.
I imagine it is okay for kids to play with in the garden but I'll stick to my Lavuu or French Infantry tent.  The French one is for deserts, so it's a strange salmon colour but it has vents on the side for good airflow.
We bought the exact same tent, and it's so lop sided at the one side! No matter what we did, we couldn't get the bottom to sit properly. We had the same issue that you did.
💖🇬🇷💕❤️
Great video Claire. I was wondering if you found the red colour affected your vision in any way? The red looked very powerful as the light shined through the tent material. I have a blue/grey tent which I find doesn't hurt my eyes as much compared to when I sit in my friends green tent for example.
these kind of tents are for the kids to play in the back garden in the summer but for 21 quid you get what you pay for
12:40: "There is freedom within. There is freedom without. Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup". jk
Chocolate Pudding you said?  That looked an awful lot like a brownie yeah? I'm from the US, so Clair what do you call a brownie in your lands?
Nice ending- you instantly transformed the tent into an innocent picnic blanket!
Nothing stealthy about this camp with your beacon of a tent!
Here in Canada, lightweight camouflage tarps  are readily available, in many sizes. They are very inexpensive, so you could camo your tent - and add rain protection - for $20. In another video, I see you have a camo tarp.  If your aim is to be unseeen, use the camo.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's great to show everyone that you don't have to invest a lot of money to get started
You’re so adorable 🥰
is that the waterproof tent from argos ???
Watching Clair wrestle with her tent makes me nostalgic for the simple tents of yesteryear i.e /\ shape, with just 2 poles holding it up (these came in 6 clip together bits, and the 2-person tent, was complete with waterproof floor and a zip up fly screen door in the front.  Thin twine ropes held it in place and just one person could set it up in a few minutes, under most conditions.  The whole thing packed up neatly into a small plastic bag.  I carried this cheap but well-made tent with me on my motorcycle for years.  Stealth camped in a number of places ranging from forests to housing estates being built, without being bothered by anyone once.
Parabéns querdinha lindinha AMOR
My God……the WORST camper i have EVER seen! She needs a class Bad!
2:57 best part ever seen in your videos.
That "tent" sounds like a giant potato chip bag and that fiberglass pole looks like it's ready to snap and tear a hole in your arm at about the 3 minute mark. I swear to God, Amazon will sell anything, literally anything. If they dipped these in Anthrax and asbestos dust Amazon would happily peddle them to any and as many people as would buy them.
I managed to get a green one, but expecting I'd end up with a red version, I'd already made a couple of large leaf-shaped stencils and bought several spray cans of various shades of green, so I went ahead anyway and painted the entire tent with a mass of variegated foliage. Upon testing out its visibility in dimming daylight, I actually had a job to find it again. So my additional camouflage  worked almost too well. The only slight downside was that the paint stiffened up the material and when unpacking it, there were a lot of creases that couldn't be shaken out.
What is the Defination of Stealth Camping? I Guess this Woman is Truly Being a Woman... By Being So Intelligent by Camping in Bright Red Tent... Die Woman....
I feel that Claire WildBeare would have made an excellent wartime spy, dropped behind enemy lines, and successfully concealing herself from the enemy
calling this stealth camping was a bit of a stretch.
Your so cool. Love it
Hi dr ❤️ How are you 💗 i always watch your video's ❤ so beautiful and enjoy full your video's i want to camping with you some days in jungle Can you come with me
Put the pegs in on the bottom of the tent before you put the poles in 😁
Ive to see you again my dear . Last time it was really scary creepy but I love watching like that 👀😱❣️that’s why I watching ur video good luck 🤞🏽 tonight😱🙏🏾❤
They make Camo-style tarpaulins, some have repeating bits that hang loose to give a three dimensional illusion. The tarps can be folded up into tiny packages for carrying and unravel to an area large enough to cover your red tent.
Wow.. Nice video, nice sharing my dear friends.. Hai from Borneo 😊😊
There´s a very positive and attractive young lady trying out new gear in the woods, finally hiding in a red chinese tent, love it🥰
I tested a 1 to 2 person singel tent and it was a dry weather but after ca 2 hours i veke up because their was no oxygen in the tent so i had to open the door to get some air and it was to short for me because i am 185 cm tal.
That's it, I'm going camping.
Great video. Can you tell the weight of ypur Vango pillow ? Looks really comfy
Have just found your channel by chance, so far, loving the videos. I love camping, yet, i've still to try wilde! I am male yet scared to do it! You though, make it look so easy and less scary! Now to watch some more videos! Thank you
Very ASMR voice. I fell asleep in uk woods few year back and got semi eaten by biting bug. I find camping or going anywhere I seem to get bitten. I think half of it might be fleas, I know some are horse flys. It can be very annoying and the bite marks make me feel unattractive. Apart from to the little vampire like critters. Eaten and used many "remedies". I do not think the UK manages its woodland at all well in many areas. Seems to be more insect breeding and dog walkers every where around here (lancs...) and dog muck.... ewww   I was however most impressed with the lake island camping in Wales video.  The presence that made the expression "I dont think Im supposed to be here". Have had similiar feelings in random places. Now I would move on from that feeling to return "why not?"
Makes sense 🤔🤔🤔
Hmmm, nice try, good to see you having a go
I recommend that you carry bear spray.
Try Australia. 12ft by12ft tarp ,your effort need not be  ,chuck some local foliage, just a little tip.
There's a Booger Man in those woods. 🥴😳😄
Thanks!! This was awesome!! 😃👍🏽❤️
I do see your FB posts.
You are great. I miss the notification.
Dint watch ya video u need a camouflage tarp. Mines a tesco32$  n turquoise.
0:14 So, that's a 2 person tent? For two baby Chinese persons maybe?!?! wow! (although it was billed as a festival tent... so, yeah - once you've had enough beer and invited a midget back to the tent with you... it could be a two man tent, maybe...) Thanks for the sponge tip (to soak up and try out the water in the tent!) Stealth Camping in a bright red tent - Steve Wallis (@campingwithsteve) would be proud!
Great video ❤. I've done 10 years homelessness.
Problem with all those pole setups is the metal joints catch on the fabric sleeve where they slide through making it difficult to locate the ends if you don't spot it. Can see one of them is still caught at 3:35
cheap tents rustle  like a crisp packet. That is why I can't bear them.
i a e gata vc tá mais madura do que outro vídeo Responde em português povavor 🌹🌹
I think you're very brave to go camping on your own. Just came across your channel. Do you ever get scared or lonely?
Isn't she wonderful
hahahahahaaha great 2 person tent nooooooooo  💯
Your adventure in the bright red tent reminded me of my own travels through the wilderness.  There is something enchanting about seeking shelter in the most basic of forms, with nothing but the natural world to protect you.  Your resourcefulness in using your hoodie and dead ferns to disguise the tent is commendable, and your description of the tent shimmering in the night like a "glow-worm with carpet burns" is a delightful turn of phrase.  I appreciate your honesty about the limitations of this tent in harsher conditions, and your willingness to test it with caution and backup plans.  Your willingness to share your experiences with the world is a testament to the spirit of adventure and the love of the great outdoors.   Keep on exploring and sharing your stories, my friend. 👏💙
Hi, are you going to do a video on foraging in the wild?? 🤔
Ótimo vídeo. Parabéns.
"Stealth" camping?
You need a couple camo covers to put up
Claire get yourself up to the Scottish highlands on the west coast . Wild camping is legal in Scotland and so many open spaces to choose from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Thank you for uploading, i couldn't sleep out there, i worry about sounds in the night.
Get yourself a camo tarp there about ten quid you can cover most of that tent with one and have extra rain protection
Danke du süße, ich finde dich und deine Videos 👍👌, du bist einfach toll.🙋
je veut bien faire du camping avec toi !!!
this is good video it is a nice tent i am glad you are trying out other tents like this one i like how you smile make your videos so enjoyable 👍😃
There is camo all around you. Doesn't matter if the tent is red. But then, I am Canadian. I would just cover it in leaves.
Looks like a tent perfectly designed for the lollipop guild
hi you lost me w the ad!
Why don't they put these videos in chronological order?
Wow what a horrible tent! You get what you pay for.
Love it girl don’t worry about it being red in the dark you had big white light and fire on it the dark sure people could see that 😅
It looks like a dogs tent 😅
A good tent for the kids!
Funny Woman 🤣
Happened upon your chnl and really enjoying it. Great content, love the stormy ones. Living a couple of milers from windermere I'm in the perfect spot myself, I'm watching out for a good tent now you gave me the idea 🖖 subbed.
I've been following Steve Wallis youtube channel for a long time. He does a lot of these stealth camping videos. Would love to see you both collab!
A tarp made into a plowpoint,  over the door would work perfectly
Hey, try pegging down the tent before putting the poles up. :)
Come camp with me in the Alaska wilderness  I have property on a glacier lave 99 miles from Homer Alaska, 1.5 miles from the ocean  Spring whale and mountain goat. No I’m not a not  It a beautiful place
Hi I'm Geoff just Frist time watching yr video s . Very interesting I'm thinking about going camping in Cornwall with my dog Tyson so I don't know if it will be strath camping
You are brave woman I want to spend one day with you if you want. Thank you so much From Algeria
Seems to me that such a tent would be designed for visibility, to increase the chance of rescue in case of emergency. Cool video! Thank You!
i would get so sketched out being alone
I have to blend in she said, meanwhile, the cheap plastic bag that holds the tent poles sounds like 10 bags of crisps being opened all at once lmao WHO in the right mind would make a red tent to begin with
Spray paint
Love watching all your videos but the music is too loud and drowns you out and you have to adjust the volume between you and the music.
So sorry. Realised that I was enjoying the content but forgot to subscribe 😱so I usually struggle to find your channel.
Your wonderfull Woman.
Hello I like camping as well you are good looking are you single and do you do Facebook
My kids wendyhouse is more robust and its been up 10 years
Love Your films and I Get Inspired. Greetings from Norway! Your films gives me the magical feeling from reading E.F Bensons «The Man Who Went To Far». Looking forward to Your next adventure!
https://youtu.be/bUDHzHQ1h-Y
any tent (expensive or cheap) is fine as long as you place a simple tarp over it.  a sail with a rope on a tree is actually already a tarp.  a tarp prevents condensation and catches the worst of the heat and rain.  this way your tent and you stay comfortable. Ps a (cheap) plastic sheet únder your tent and you camp like in a palace ;-)
So fit❤
Love your videos. I see you as the nigella Lawson of camping
8:18 to 8:30 - Mr. Fox is hunting for Mrs Fox.
That tent is barely big enough for the 4 legged fox, ...but the 2 legged fox managed just fine.  Great to see she finally got the pole in the hole.  Pole in the hole fails are no fun.
She's hardly out in the woods. That ground has previously been cleared and leveled. This is a clip of a chick putting up a little tent. I don't believe she spent the night there.
I bought a cheap tent once... Never again! A whole weekend at a festival, on another continent, while rain dripped in through the cheap single layer and left us sleeping in a puddle for 3 nights... Worst experience ever!
A few years ago I bought such a tent in Polish tesco for 5 pounds. Mine was blue :)
"Can't get it in" Lol
Von Dir???👍😯💖aber keine Promotion damit machen!😂🙋🇩🇪🐒
Fit
I have a simular tent in camo green. Those cheap tents, has to be seam sealed and impregnated, before first using.  Foe very wet conditions, it might be an option to rund a candle lantern, the whole night, to push the moisture out of the tent.
Not even Warwick & Samantha Davis would enjoy a night in this tent.⛺🤣
What area of the country do you camp in?  Are you in different locations?  Lake District? Peaks? South West? Wales?  Do you walk far from your car to get there?  I Moto camp, so either camp sites, or Scotland, because the bike is too obvious.
As a female solo camper, I spent £500 on a good Terra Nova tent in forest green so I don't stand out.
Sucky infomercial dogshit?....gimme a break?................fark!
25 gbp crazy cheap wow  great video thanks
What happens if she gets caught?
Great video as always how do you overcome the fear of camping alone?
Which color should one pick for stealth camping? Of course red!
Good old England,the only things you can count on are  rain and taxes
Thanks for the video, all ways nice to see you 😊
Hey, lil smart girl, don't buying a rubbish and waste your money 😉
So if you could keep doinv this stuff but add a motorcycle journey and eat some wierd wild food then this would be perfecto😊
❤❤❤😊
Não consigo entender seu dioma.conprendes Linda só com sigo entender quando vc fais gesto😊 gata
Que dá ora para pelo canpamento 😊
Hi Claire where do I buy this tent
I would love to pitch a tent for.....I mean with you.
Am not sure bright red and stealth go hand in hand😂  P.s Pink next time😉
❤❤❤❤🌹🌹💋💋💋💋💋lindana
❤❤❤🌹🌹🌹💋💋💋 gata lindona
A tent that gives you a Hart attack trying to assemble it 😂😂😂
I use camo tent so i wont get raped by migrants.
Where in the South you from London ?
Where ever you are is great to see in any tent 🙂
i used to have that tent! cost me £15 in wilkos. took it with me camping. absolutely fun, and i had a sleeping bag an airbed a festival cookset and a cup too. spent 2 days out. and it was sunny so i didn't worry about rain.
that's cool i wanna try this !
Please stay safe doing this type of camping please miss you have earned a subscription from please keep yourself safe ian Mitchell
Love the red tent dude had a blue one exactly the same
I traveled a lot by bicycle.  I just took spray paint and camouflaged my tent. It worked very well.  I also used hunting blind cover  to make wall. Peace and love people 💕 🙏✌️
It's hillarious that everyone is repeating same part of this video
Why would you care if anyone saw it.  Weird.
❤
👍
Loved the video but be careful camping out alone. Best of luck with your future adventure's.👍
North Face has been suspiciously quite since this tent hit the market...
I brought this tent in orange and at 6ft3 and reasonably broad it is barely a 1 man tent haha
Remember the comedy show bottom ? It's like their tent they had !!! Lol Great video
Isn't she wonderful
As a Yank, when I hear "21 pound" tent, I'm thinking 21 lb--not 21 £. That's a family-size shelter. I was wondering how in the world you were lugging around a tent that heavy for just yourself!
KONTENKU SEPI MULU 😓 WALAUPUN SEPI HARUS TETAP SEMANGAT BUAT KALIAN SEMUA 💖🥰'.
Very cool to see how much you're into solitude and nature.  The outdoors is certainly my go-to for joy. I can see why your channel is growing fast..love it!
I cant imagine anyone seeing a bright red 'play' tent in the middle of a woods! So stealthy!!!!
Why her want to be stealth from other people? It is not a Wild West...
Nice going! For some reason I find some of your vids quite ASMR-like. 🙂
Dumb question… what’s the issue with being seen?
That music at 5:38. 🙂
Interesting stealth concept of hiding the tent/camp behind self build natural material obstacles! Options: a) Covering cheap tent with 2nd layer like (fish)net & natural leaves / straw, or spray your stealth color of choice (perhaps also a coat of impregnation). b) Cheap tiny sun shelter beach tent, with the entry / door on the long side. Some of those cheap beach tents are closable (zip) as ideal 1st time try out of hike & overnight or just as a emergency tent for not planned overnight hikes/bicycle tours.
جميل جدا لكن الا تشعرين بالخوف انت شجاعة جدا ماشاء الله 🇩🇿
21 lbs is too heavy for me to carry.
Beautiful, dogging spot that
Oooo matron.....the innuendo's were hard to miss!  Looked like a moist night of camping. 😅
Oh look at my bum whilst i stealthily get into my tent....didnt realise the camera caught that angle 😂😂  Nice bum tho! 👍
2 man tent lol, of course amazon says 2 person tent
Better off with a bag for life from your favourite supermarket
great vid, nice to see you testing really cheap kit and seeing what its limitations are.
Brava😅
Just got to get this in there lol sorry for my dirty mind everyone 😂
Bad boy needs a man! 😂
I’m wondering if this is a single tent for baby Satan?
I bought this tent when I was camping for a few nights and visiting a friend. The tent I was using broke (an incident with a badger) and this was available cheap at the local Argos. It was fine for a night just by myself, even with rain and I stayed dry. I am quite short so the size wasn't a problem. However, the tent did not survive my Guides (Girlguiding). We were practicing putting up the tent and they managed it. Then they wanted to go inside. All of them at once. And they were rather excited until a pole snapped 😂
Cheap but I guess a cammo net would help or even better used with a tarp
Maybe good for the summer?
OK that dawg was funny!
Outlander comes to mind Claire
That makes two 🦊🦊 foxes in the woods. Lights in the tent will light up for miles. It totally removed the stealth factor Your glow in the dark lines show out too
Um...I can see you 😉 Like really....I can still see you 😜. Carry camo netting and add some forest duff to disappear totally. This also works for hiding motorcycles and bicycles that you don't want found on the trails. Just saying 😒
So if it is an "obscure little spot" then it is not stealth camping.    I say this because she is not hiding from anyone right?
What about 20 cents tent, 2 ounces only? Heavy duty garbage bag, and you can easily regulate moisture by making holes.
Way to go Mandingo. You know it makes total sense. Rights!
Try’s blending in in a dog dick red tent 😂😂😂
What do you expect for 20 quid, its aimed at festival goers.
That was cool.
Oh my word, I have to subscribe
Do you genuinely do all these camps solo?
I used a cheap tent once, borrowed from my sister. Never again! It was the mid-1980s and my first visit to Sidmouth Folk Festival. I'd booked quite late, so was in the overflow campsite, on top of the hill. It rained hard every day. The only things that stayed dry were those kept in my neighbour's tent, a Peapod - I'd met this chap for the first time, as we alighted the same train - so kind of him. For some reason, I'd packed two towels, so one was used for washing, the other for mopping the tent floor. Still got my first rucksack though - a Berghaus AB65. Lesson learned, my own first tent was a relatively basic Blacks model, but survived a torrential downpour that saw others washed out and spending the night in their cars. So my complaint about a small puddle around one pole base was nothing  by comparison.
You're cool.. keep up the good content hun babez 👍⛺
Looks like Oxshott/Esher sort of area.
maybe spray paint it camo colours.  you are a real trooper and I was surprised at your spjnge when you squeezed it out from condensation..wow
Cherry Blossom. Hey. Thanks a lot for the film. Craig. Reds the best! Hey. I need to pay these guys back... Let me comment you in a couple hours.
Great you got it built I would not. Happy Easter to you
Dont' buy Chinese gear.
Show if the seams are taped in your next videos... Untaped (stitched) seams are never water tight.
Great video!
I cannot believe the stupidity I started to watch. Talks about blending in!
Beautiful video   😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Steve Wallis has left the chat.
In Canada,  if you had food in your tent, something would come calling and eat you.
I remember buying one of them years ago but in green. I am 6ft6 and no way I could fit in it :) these days I just use a DD 4x4 apart for a few days ago when I slept in my box trailer lol
I love your videos! Subbed! You have a new fan! Greetings from Brazil!
Your amazing beautiful
They make it smaller so you break it, its like a ferrari tent without the glamour 😂
Hello Claire, At £21 is really does allow people with a small budget to start camping... Take care Paul,,
One thing to be aware of is birdwatchers! I'm a keen birder, and when I'm walking through the woods I'm always looking around closely and I have binoculars. Dark or camo tents are definitely the best option...
You can't expect a lot for £21 I remember the old style ridge tents they used to come in orange colour the ex army camo tents 2 person may be better for stealth camping you are not a nervous person living in the woods overnight you know how to survive in rough conditions which is great.
Have you ever done the gower peninsula if not you should go most beautiful place you will ever go Claire x
Stealth camping in front of 102,000 hungry YouTube viewers is what I´d call it. You almost had me there for a spell.
Red is great if you need to be seen……but no good for stealth mode !
👍
Hi, I've watched at least 10 of your videos in the last few weeks, they are amazing, like you Claire. Really interesting !
Hi beautiful and wild woman, I love your videos, best regards from Norway.
Lovely hair x
This women should not be an youtuber she don't reply any of my comment
Good afternoon Claire and Happy Easter.   These videos  just keep getting better and better.   Superb production values.  You're looking great as always.     Thanks so much for sharing another look at the chronicles of your life living and camping in the Great Outdoors!!   😍😍
👋🏻🙂💭
Poundland sold a very similar tent, in green, in some of their larger stores last year.
You are so brave doing solo camps if it was me any little noise I would panic but love your content keep it coming 😁
6:28 NOT Goretex
👍🏽👍🏽🫶🏽
Just stupid. So the young muppets are now learning to put tents up in their 20s. I dont even know what to say. Im sad. 😢
its colour will soon fade
Hi Claire great video, I like the way you made it stealthy 🙂
Aww life on cloud its luuuuuurvely
This is not stealth camping
That’s awesome, another channel reviewed that same tent in steady rain and it filled up with water, your lil stealth camp was quite nice 👍.
Bright red is not stealth. Enjoyed the video. I love how you face challenges.
nice we over nighter well done
Excelente. Aqui, do extremo sul do Bradil.😊
21 pounds? My heaviest tent only weighs 4 pounds. lol JK Thx for another one; it always brightens my day.
When you teased “21 lb tent,” I thought, “that’s pretty heavy for a tent.”  Silly me.
An attractive, personable, young female reviews a tent that 99% of the respondents wouldn't conceive of buying in a blind fit. Ah! the human condition....
I bought a couple of twenty quid, single skin tents, from a supermarket. They are still my go-to tent for mild conditions and summer camping. Sure the condensation is bad if you take it to the Scottish Highlands in autumn, but it was manageable and it kept the rain out.  Worth noting that most non-premium tents are all made in the same factories as these budget tents. Same factory, different branding and specs. Many of these budget tents are exceptional and the only real issue is the weight, and lack of features. Totally rate them, especially if you are going somewhere with non-life threatening weather, where you are camping conditions where it might get wrecked.
Red tent... stealth... you are not very smart.
How to corner the market…………….well done
Claire, just amazing video footage, love this, thanks for sharing your camping adventure, looks like so much fun. Myself i always bring bear spray, i'm more worried about coyotes than bears :)
Do a more survival style video! Somewhere in the south west good to go
Where you been hiding young lady, we all miss you 💖💖💖💖
When I was in to scouting as a young kid I found so called two man tents all were too small for two or anything.  Whatever they claim my minimum rule is to subtract 1 from it making a 4 person in to a 3 and so in.  As always great footage.  Loved the fox.  :)
For those who want to know (from a condensation perspective) you expel about 1 coke can of water during the night. Do t know why I’m telling you, but here you go.
😂 class!! A stealth camp in a bright red tent 😂 Although to be fair, you hid it well 👌. I didn’t think you were going to fit in at first, thought it was a kiddies tent 😂. Keep up the great vids 👍
It looked like you were in a dark room developing photos. I really enjoyed the video 😊
Claire if the sun comes out and you're in that little red tent you could get a sun tan. Almost like being in a tanning booth 😀. I couldn't find you, 😊. Glad you had a marvelous time and you stayed safe. Thank you for sharing this video. Take care and enjoy your trips.
Why didn't you collect a load of dead bracken / ferns BEFORE you started erecting the tent, then build a large hollow rectangular wall larger than the tent..erecting the tent inside. THEN cover the top of the tent with bracken when erected ? Meaning very little chance of it being seen
Steve Wallis would be proud 🤣
That red fits in with the forest,like a lighthouse in the sky 👍👌👏✌️
Another amazing video! Is that the firemaple lantern, I've been looking to replace my campingaz one, I love the glow and the noise (reminds me family camping holidays in France), but struggling to find to find many that use the same cylinder as the Jetboils
hello, that was my first store and it was disastrous ⛈️, but I learned, and living hidden like this is not pleasant at all, but you also learn 🤫, and I do the same as you to walk away, to see if the store or the Hammock from afar, a good tarp camouflages everything, big hug 🙏 i❤️🌲🐾🏞️🐦🐗🐕☕✊💞♾️
Most (not as charming) people would have edited out the naff attempt to get your poles in but not our charming Claire!
Single skin?  Definitely not a tent to take out when it's raining or cold then.  Still, in the height of summer this should do the job - even with little ventilation.
To make it easier on yourself, you’ll be better off with a pop-up tent through the same size no muss no fuss
Ughhhh, just the sound of that plastic 🤢 You need to get yourself a little cammo net.
Thank you for this great video. Before I knew much about stealth camping, I bought a bright red 2-man tent. I love it accept for the colour. I haven’t done my first camp yet but with your pointers I might just get away with it in my local woods. 🙏🌳👌🐈‍⬛🦇🐝🫀
bright red is not stealth.....but i guess when you are trying to get youtube view money its not about accuracy.....it seems in your case .its about you making the most money you can make with the least amount of effort or work :)
😍😍😻😻👍👍
Claire, you do look hot in red!!!!
Great video!!!
Claire, cover your tent with a trap that makes it invisible!!!!
Cute little fox.
Oioi let me come with you and we camp in same tent haha oioi x
Claire: 🤫🤐 Claire's tent: 🚨💥🆘❗⏰📢🚒
Interesting to try this tent in the el cheapo range. Home Bargains (UK store) make a bigger version for £14.99 in bright blue or full grey-green. Two person. This one is 7ft 3 inches (220cm) long by 4ft (120cm) wide and 3ft high (95cm). Similar construction with mesh inner and mesh top vent. Not going to shake the world! And not a threat to the £800 - £900 Hilleberg Soulo two person.   Bought the blue one for my grandson to get him started. Maybe summer use when dry weather forecast!
hmm no step 2
The tent looked very childlike and the colour red was not idea as you found. Another good one though Claire. 😊
Lovely cheap Easter tent
Hilleberg R&D on line 2 😋
I would say of all your wilderness adventures this is by far the bravest one hardly enough room for a dog. I glad you were closer to home. ❤🇺🇲🇮🇹Fan, be safe.
Claire, "why did you buy such a cheep tent"? Their ain't nothing stealthy about a bright red tent. That's just asking for trouble. People see that a mile away, with no leaves on the trees even. Steve Wallace would be in a panic mode if he had that. Any way lol we still love you , are little wild beare. ❤❤.from a🇮🇹🇺🇲fan to are 😇 and sweet heart. Try covering it up with a blend in tarp to nature's surroundings next time or leaves and twig's. Good day are 😇.😁🤗🇬🇧🇫🇮wild beare I think.
Mat  brand ? Thanks for an amazing outdoor video. So jealous of youre adventures
Just as well it was not chucking down with rain while you were putting that tent up. You would have been soaked by the time you located the poles in their pockets. Brings back memories of a very wet Norwegian holiday in my youth in a cheap single-skinned tent. The highlight was having to turf a goat out after it barged in and somehow opened the zip. Not just wet, but smelly too!
I’ve got this tent but only paid £14 from go outdoors
Marry me!
Someone please explain the UK obsession with so called stealth camping!!!??? I can camp anywhere I want on USA Federal land. (Almost anywhere)
Military Surplus Camo Netting might help.
I did a solo wood camp on Monday night, the temperature did drop and the morning brought frost, I couldn’t wait to be back in my car and away 😂
The tent I've use the last 3 to times I've been wild camping is a cheap 3 man tent from Tesco!   Some may laugh, but it has kept us warm and dry and there is plenty of room for me, my dog and my gear, the last time my friend also slept in there with us!   Goes to show that everyone can enjoy the great outdoors without breaking the bank!
One day, try something like a Vango Force 10 Mk3 Old school cotton tent or cotton inner, nylon outer. Heavy, less roomy but bombproof, warm & no condensation. Comfort camping if you have means of conveyance - canoe, snow-mobile, dogs, quad, even bike.
Why does it matter if somebody sees you?
Sounds like a packet of crisps when you unroll it.  The sign of quality...
Clever😎
The timing of the howling dogs was priceless.
My tent cost €24 and is great for myself and my 2 dogs. Never had a problem with it.
What fun! You weren't going to let that pole win. Looking forward to your next video adventure!
6:08 don't be rude
Hi, from Alabama USA
You’re very cool! ❤
Just the sound of the tent put me off it 😂
i have the £15 tesco tent and i love it, never let me down yet, but i go kayak camping to beaches in the summer, i used it for the circumnavigation of the isle of man by kayak first weekend in march, quite cold but was toasty inside its  a double skin and a little bigger than your red tent, but it gets treated ruff as i have to stuff it in the kayak but still had some great camps never leaked either just lucky i guess
Only watched a couple of your videos ... they're so silly! Do you camp in city parks pretending to be in the wild then spend all your time worried about being spotted? And ... are you called Bear(e) because of all that hug amount of brown cuddly hair?
Am sure her body guard is right next to her lol😊
May have been worth chucking a survival blanket over it in the hope that it's mirror finish would reflect it's surroundings.  Never tried it
Good video, good job you are so sweet 🤗🤗🤗
That tent would be perfect to make a sand pit in. Fill up with sand and close the door at the end of play. Also keeps sun of the little ones. Love watching these videos.
Stealth camping is just camping on illegal property?  I don't get it
I'm doing it
Oh, I didn't realise that the 'authentic cheap-tent experience' was a thing! Cool! The antithesis of the 'phoney glamping experience'. Great to see you having so much fun on such a tiny budget :)
you nutter in your red stealth tent, your bringing the Good name of stealth camping into disrepute. Subscribed .
What kind of tape do you recommend for a  teared hole in a tent?
Stealth lol I've  just spotted it on google earth .
Good video, well put together and made very interesting. Nice to see someone from the UK doing this. She's like Lara Croft! Well spoken and very attractive! Please be careful! :)
I've used the kelty grand mesa 2 for 15 years! Never got wet or anything. It also has a vestibule. It was like 140 bucks.
Do you want company in your tent? 😂
Super Well Done.
Love to bump into you ! In a forest some were . ❤
I had a 3 man Eurohike Avon tent up all summer for years for the kids and us to sleep in the garden, and we ended up using it well into September. It withstood storms, torrential rain and all the rough and tumble of a family and kids using it year after year after year with absolutely no issues. Rock solid, waterproof, strong but a bit heavy and overall an absolute beater of a tent. I couldn’t recommend the brand highly enough because it cost me around £80 a few years ago.
One night stelth camp and what you’re saving on campsite fees pays for the tent, free trips from then, possibly only in fine weather though 🏕️👍🏻
Dont get caught by a bear hel end up going deepinside u 😂
Fascinating...your pretty cool.😁
https://youtu.be/83WsRmn5IHA
Just use a green tarp and cover the tarp in leaves etc
Hehe this was my very first wild camping tent I brought and even tho it was light ,I didn't like the colour and it was a pain to get up and the condensation was terrible. Save your penny's and defo save up a little, for something much better on a budget.
Trying to be stealthy whilst wrestling a tent that sounds like a 1000 crisp packets..😂 Cracking idea with the fern/bracken wall, will remember that one.
Watching you struggle with the pole I half extol to do a Russel from UP and get hit in the face or the tent to fly off.
Nice little camp. ATB
That's not a two man tent
Hi Claire! Thank you so much for your videos. I have enjoyed them immensely!  I like how you made me laugh with the struggle of the poles. 😂Thanks for always making. You are amazing and have given me a little more courage !😊 stay safe out there.🙏🏼😇🏕️
.
Disposable festival tent
Can I ask ,the location is it for privacy or safety, or just to get away from anybody? Thanks mike enjoy and be careful.
Pulled that off quite well for being such a bright red. Enjoy your videos. Soothing voice and such a natural beauty😊
Always enjoy your vlogs, this will give encouragement to those who wanna dip thier toe in to nature and realise the benefits so thankyooo:)
Well it did keep the slugs out of your hair.
Well, I was half way threw your WONDERFUL Video on this tent, seemed like it was hard to put up, and I am SURE it would NOT fit two people, Well MAYBE HOBBITS! But not two adults, Thanks for Posting this one about this tent!! I need a new one and this one will sure not be it! THANK YOU! Your Awesome and Adorable!
Love it
Lovely I look forward to seeing more cheap tent adventures
Who on earth makes a bright red tent?! Is it for beach use?
I’m guessing it is really aimed at people going to festivals etc. in fact it would be easier to locate amongst 3000 other tents? Unfortunately, festival goers notoriously just buy something cheap like this and abandon it on-site. I’m not a fan of that disposable culture.
I bought something similar on offer at Tesco a year or so ago for under £10 just to figure out what sort of size I would want. It was bigger than the one in the video. I left it out in the rain over night and it leaked once the single layer soaked through. For a bit of fun I tried covering it in Fabsil water repellant spray. It improved it a little but didn’t solve the problem. I think the weave just isn’t tight enough. So dry weather only for these cheap tents.
Lots of condensation on single skin.
Servus machst ein par schwarze Punkte drauf ist ein Marienkäfer?🐞 Zu Klein ist es auch nicht man kann ja kuscheln!👩‍❤‍💋‍👨🫂 Aber schwer zum aufbauen, allein fast nicht zu schaffen. Aber sonst   Viel Liebe Michael😘😍
Seen a few people use this tent and does seem to be good for the vertically challenged only 😂
Love your screen building skills.
Hi Claire, I was just wondering if you have ever had some scary experiences while camping in the woods? My own frightening experience was when I had deers outside my tent, in the middle of the night. It was terrifying 😁 Thanks for the video.
anytime its listed as a 2 person tent. Figure its 2 kids.
I spent a lot of cash on a tent then found I wasn't all that fussed on camping. Reminded me of why I left the scouts as a young lad.
It sounds like your getting into a crisp packet 😂
Take a dry bag with you to store your boots in outside the tent. Even multiple dry bags so you can store some of the other gear outside. Or better yet, tie a rope between 2 trees and lay a Camo tarp over it so you've got some privacy and extra shelter.
If you want a quality low price tent I highly recommend the Eurohike Tamarr 2. I bought for the daughter as a garden play tent and it was out for weeks in wind and rain and never leaked once. Amazed as it was about £50 at the time.
I'd say you pulled off hiding that tent quite well! It will be interesting to see how it does in the rain. I should think if you use your bivvy bag and maybe fly a tarp overhead you shouldn't get too damp?
Great tent for the fly campers 😂
Stealth beare
So in Europe or England is there rules against camping around where you are?
👍👍👍!!!
When I ordered my first Hille (two person Allak) my partner bought a Eurohike Rydal 500 from our local Millets for £150! It’s a vast five person tent with sitting room where you can stand upright. It weighs 15kg and is a pain to put up/take down as the poles separate in the sleeves in the process. But once pitched it’s fine for quite breezy camp sites. He’s since bought a three person tent which is easier and cost £170 from Millets. Eurohike tents are high quality hard wearing but heavy and bulky 😳
OK here’s the thing…….. How can a Bright RED Tent be stealth Camping, The whole idea is staying undetected…… Duh 🙄
Cool little camp Claire and I love the English woodland 🇬🇧 🇳🇿
I wouldn't worry about the colour so much, it's the sound of unwrapping it! Sounds like you are opening a bag of crisps in a cinema just as it all goes quiet 🤣😂 But great work, and keep those videos coming.
A few strange noises and entertaining commentary while putting that up!
Thanks for sharing your expérience with this cheap tent ! 🤗🏞️
Hey Claire, thanks for this video, really enjoyed it as always. I really like it when you review and test budget equipment! Thanks!
Learn to blend in with a day glow red tent 🤣🤣👍🏽⛺️ all the passers-by can hear is “eeeeer ooooo I can’t get it in” thanks Claire, fun camp, had me laughing
Great Video as always but way too Red for my stealth camping unfortunately lol  But hey at least it wasn't pink 😂 Great Video you always make me laugh look forward to watching the next one 😊
You are so cute 😊
I've got a £20 summer tent. The worse part is putting in the fibreglass poles and taking them out again. It has no guy ropes. It's like a sauna in summer in the tent. Fair weather tent only
You had it open in the rain so part of that wasn’t condensation from breath…Have fun stay safe.
for the red tent buy a lightweight camouflaged netting Ü  *on your open camping, try a combo of bivvy and tarp in heavy rain.. bivvy is waterproof so your sleeping bag won't get wet and the tarp keeps heavy rains out — it will make a great 20 min video to watch :)
WOW. Thats a little small. A camouflage tarp over it would have helped. You did great making a camouflage wall. Thanks for the video.
:-) *
On the plus side you will always be able to locate your camp after exploring the area 😉 Seriously though... great video Claire! It's awesome to see you testing out some (very) inexpensive gear. Looking forward to seeing what fun lil' adventures you have planned for Ol' Red here :)  I hope that the rest of your week is amazing my friend! :)  Stay wild.... 🐻 -John
😂🤣😂 you with the pole in the beginning, I could watch that over and over!
Hello 👋 Claire, thank you for another fun tag along. I like your new tent. Be sure to take good care of yourself. Stay safe out there. 🤗
“Hoodie Camo” = Cloak of Invisibility. 🥷🏿
Somebody call the cops, the woman is out of control
You looked like a little merecat when you were looking around...so cute!
The best budget tent I ever bought was a used Vango world challenge Solo plus (Helix 200) I bought it for £35. I’ll be using that this summer on a few outings.
Great video, thanks 👍
Woahhhhh
lol, definitely not very stealthy when you can hear the floor of the tent crinkling so loudly!
The hoodie on the top for camouflage 😂🙌🏻
Claire, I would love for you to try out an Amok Draumr 5.0 hammock setup. I think you would love it once you got used to it. Have a look at them and maybe reach out and see if they’ll give you a demo to try. I LOVE mine!!!
Hello Claire.. I have used one of those tents many years ago. They are alright in warm and dry weather. I had mine for when i was Marshalling for the races but it filled with water when it rained hard it was then my camping was ruined as everything got so wet i had to use Race-control building great fun though.. Regards Mick.. Chef-on-the-wild-side.. X
Could have pitched in your back garden.
21 pound ? that is awful heavy. :)
A fun escapade, Claire. You brave all your challenges with style and grace. I'll be back.
I picked up a small cheap tent the other day to do a trip on a budget. And while the tents okay, the fly screen isn’t anywhere near small enough to keep bugs out
A part of me continues to suspect that you are in fact Kate, hiding in plain sight and that at any moment William will appear from behind the camera and the secret will be revealed. Either way, it's a great channel. Thanks
Three Hundred Fifth First comment here 😂
My first tent was a Coleman Viper, 1 person, double skin, 2.1Kg. Bought in about 2003 for ~£39 (£66 today), after turning my back on the expensive Hilleberg Akto at six times the price. Nice and roomy but not stealth as it's blue with orange edging.  (I looked it up online some time ago and was pleasantly surprised to find a YT review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF6vGBcunfc) I really appreciate good value for money kit and supporting the people who make it.
Hilleberg =Amazon special. Why would anyone spend all that money on an expensive tent? 😅. Props for actually spending a night in it. I’m a pretty big man and I wouldn’t want to be sticking out in that red thing either ha ha. Your courageous to go out alone as it is.
Hey you ..RED TENT,,what  in hell is going on over there,,Oh never mind that's just WildBeare..lol
Cool experiment Claire! Funnily enough a cheap blue £7 3x3 tarp would probably be more versatile, last longer and provide even more protection depending how good you are at tarp-fu! It would at least allow you to cook out of the rain!
That tent was a little to snug for my liking, I need a little more room to breathe....thanks as always for sharing your adventure. 🤓
I don't know WildBeare! "I have a bad feeling about this!"😢
looked like the fox was checking you out, the red scared him off, LOL
I would be lying if I said what a nice little tent, it is crap. It would be ok for a one night fishing trip with your car nearby in case the weather turns nasty. Sorry Claire, but I like your video's . 👗
The red fox just had to see who was in the red tent ! Nice honest review with good stealth solution.
I'd be hesitant to put that up in back garden for the kids
Brilliant ❤
Neat and easy to use❤❤❤
Claire !!! 👍
😃👍
A tarp over the tent, and your sorted.
In bad weather that tent would probably be as much use as a few bin bags stapled together with a few sticks stuck in them to hold them up lol, I did like the colour though, would blend in perfectly in most urban locations as another discarded carrier bag!
Salut from Brunswick, Maine, US.
Ah e vc coube bem dentro só não sei sua altura! Mas em.fim tamanho de barraca.
Para a minha realidade de uso esse tamanho de barraca supre bem , bah  coube as coisas no ladinho... legal, da gosto de te assistir claire nos videos vc gosta e é muito contagiante!😍😍😍
First time  watcher, impressive content. Relaxing, great camera presence and wonderful voice for media.
I bought a similar size tent to keep in my walk away bag to be used inside a gymnasium or other public shelter in a hurricane scenario. Not much room, but at least a little privacy. Thank you for another fine video. Be well and at peace.
You make a cheap tent look good.   Do you think that was meant to be a children's tent?   Thanks for the video.   Hope you are doing well and have a great week.  Best wishes.
hello from Australia...im a avid stealth camper...just need more practice with capturing the event...by the way awesome vid...
@ 0:25 it's easy to pitch apparently @ 3:00 apparently not 🤣
Hi Claire…lol had to laugh when you said blend in 😂…..please check this little tent out,the Eurohike Backpacker DXL 2….crackin tent, 50 quid, green lol..waterproof HH 2000mm..I love it great tent…..copy and paste this in goog > Camo 3D Leaf cloak Yowie Ghillie Breathable Open Poncho Type Camouflage Bir P9W6 it’s brilliant for chucking over tent to blend in….Gareth.
You are just living the life!!! Great videos!!!!
Those exact tents get distributed at homeless drop in's near london..
Super stealth camp not - did the tent come with a flag? Glad you stayed dry though! 😂
Cowabunga.!
The tent was also described as "A Festival Tent" in the product description. Now imagine your at a festival and your tent is amongst another 500 tents, red is not such a bad choice for a tent colour, Unless your as lucky as me, then everybody will have had the same idea, and my red tent would just one in a sea of red tents haha.
Small condensation issue....you could have had a bath in the water you drained from the cloth ! :D
I love your short videos and it's obvious that what you do gives you great joy. You are a great inspiration to us. Do not stop :)
Claire Lol no it’s not really a two person tent ….more like a two child tent . I have had these type b4 and they worked lol. Ty for a comfy adventure
Ha...yes can see that from the one side kinda like road flares...branches and some leaves will work..
Nice to see your still doing what you just love
Highly suspicious activity.
Thank you for sharing another fun adventure 😀
Unfortunately bright colour for that challenge but you did well with your camouflage skills. Don't think you fancy squeezing two people in there! Had a right little feast in there didn't you! Glad all went well fairly for you! Will no doubt make you appreciate the trusty hilleberg even more x
have you been hiking at mallorca in 2021? me and my friends gave a lift for a hiker who looks like you :D
I can't wait for the next "Cheap Tent Camp!" I thought you were gonna snap the pole at 2:35 😂 I've had a cheap tent experience with very similar results. This was so much fun, Claire. 🙂 Btw, nice on the fly camouflage job. ✌️
😂😂😂 I swear you're mad as they come.... I love it.  I was so good at stealth or c&c (camouflage and concealment) as we call it in the army. So long as you take into account the 7 S's, you can almost become invisible even at close range.  Anyway, another great video... mad lady.
It's more like a hooped bivvy than a tent
Love your sense of humour putting this one up, can't think of anyone else that would do this 😂,  but seriously if needs be  you can make it usable and stealthy with a bit of knowhow, but you can't make yourself any shorter 😅😅.
Nice tent ⛺️ 👍 looks like fun 😀
That was fun! Mr. Fox was pretty close by!
Interesting idea. I wouldn't have attempted it with that tent but it looks like you did well. That fern wall was a good idea. :-)
That was a great video because it demonstrates the importance of why you want to be stealth. Some people have told me to have a bright tent in case someone comes looking for you if you're in distress. But I always carry a red flag with a cross that I can put up. Thanks for the video. If it doesn't rain on your tent it rains in your tent. lol Respect from your friends in Florida USA 🌴
that type of cheap tent is known as a "Festival Tent" where people buy really cheap tents and take them to music festivals to sleep in for a couple of days then leave them behind when the festival is over - that why its probably bright red so you can find which tent is yours in the hundreds pitched at the festival
Why do you have to stealth camp in the middle of a forest? Are you on private or tribal, federal land?
Disguise your camp with a pile of empty beer cans and no one’s bothering you in your play pen
This is low internet… note the innuendo of Beare ..getting beare naked in the wild , while copying other (usual male) content creators content…also , notice the generic hashtag list..what’s next? Beare van life?
Great theme for a series! Short fun escapes are awesome. If only it wasn't brite red though...😅
😎
It's more of a survival red wide bivy, being single layer and I sleep well diagonally in similar sized tents well done!
Hello Miss Claire!  Like the way you use the brush to hide your red tent. Red tents can be seen in the woods a long way off. I own a 12x14  red cabin tent. I had to use a lot of brush to conceal from others nearby in the woods. You look a lot happier in this adventure - no snow to deal with. Did a great job of setting up and filming. Thanks for what you do .
A wannabe Steve.    Good luck karen😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looks an awful lot like the single skin dome tent I had in the mid 90s but mine was tango orange and lime green 😂 great for garden or festival use but that's about it imo
*death noise*  - "you know what, this is the weirdest stealth camp ive ever done" 😂😂
For £21 I bet you get to close the zipper up to 21 whole times!
What's the point of stealth camping? I'll just drive an extra 45 mins and not feel like an idiot camping in some random park with tons of people walking around that wasn't meant for camping.
I'd love to see you use  that tent in Eryri 😂Another great video, made me laugh out loud. Thanks again, Claire.
Im 190cm. Would I fit in that?
You should have sprayed the trees and the ground reddy-pink. That should have helped.
Camped out last week with my lad not to far from the house kind like the area  your in and i didnt even look to see if passers-by  could see the tent from the paths and because  id didnt check and you could see the tent we had a few drunken  people that went to try and rob us but thankfully  I woke up. I think your really  brave. Another great vidd tho thanks
Needs a coyote brown dd tarp over the top!  Please can you squeeze me in stealthily…  If only!
Tell me to mind my own business if you want, but I really don't think it's a good idea for a young, pretty girl (or anyone else for that matter) to be out on their own in a bright red tent, regardless of how dense the foliage is or not. There are plenty of weirdos with night vision googles. Your desire to be a YT star may have unintended consequences.
I kinda like the cheap tents as it always seems really cosy for a few quid ..I got a real bargain from tesco at the end of the season only paid £5 for a very similar tent with a bonnet top & a £5 sleeping bag lol  not too bad for a Tenner
Bivvy bag lol
Wanting an authentic cheap tent experience so no tarp so how come you included the bit you bag  not really true cheap tent is it Claire
Pick up a 10x10 camo tarp... no point in stealth camping with a bright red tent. It's just called camping at that point.
Claire, it's a cheap tent suitable only for kids, either in the garden or a campsite. Be honest about this, it's not one for the woods. Or did you record this on April fools day 🤫
That red tent will shine like a beacon, why they make them in such colours i dont know.  You may need a camoflague net over it.
Enjoyed this on Claire. Its good to see how these cheap tents do when camping. You don't see other channels doing this 🙂👍
Tis Irish Bob saying hello Claire  What a grand wee adventure ye had indeed Lass.   Ye had quite a workout setting up that rascal of a tent. It would have looked perfectly camouflaged in a rose garden🙄🙄🙄  My how you made me smile and ye still managed to pull off a nice little outing. Nicely done covering the exposed viewing angle.  Even Mr Fox, had thought to  come by to see: what ye were up to in his neck of the woods.  It will be most interesting to see you test out yer little tent in different situations. A tarp is a good idea to bring for possible rainy conditions.  All in all it was a grand little adventure. Enjoy yer Easter long weekend ahead Lass.  I celebrate another year of creaking joints in a couple of days. The outdoors is good medicine for such things.   It's always nice to be part of yer adventures in the outdoors. Be well Lass, be well indeed  Irish Bob says hello and enjoy life fully. 🤗😇😎🍀☘️🇮🇪🇨🇵🦾🩺🥂
Cute camp! Thanks for sharing kiddo! #Blessed
This may well have been your funniest video. I admire your courage.  2 person tent (2 children perhaps) ??. Red um  camo for stealth camping.....Check Tent poles that only a weight lifter could love....Check Could you even sit up in it ? Several years ago we bought a cheap Decathlon pop-up tent for the kids to mess with (they are both hammock campers now) and my Son who was maybe 12, could barely fit in it.   Fortunately it was warm enough that he didn't have to close it up when we used it...
Love how you almost enjoy the challenge of adversity, as if a cheap tent wasn’t enough it has to be red. 😅 love the authenticity of your challenge I will not improve it with a tarp.
I'm 6'3".....I reckon I would have to sleep in a tent that size with my feet hanging out. 😆 🤣 😂 That sure is a tiny tent to weigh 21 lbs.
I'm not sure how you would fit two in there...but perhaps that's part of the adventure :D
🔥 I identify as a camping mat,and I donate myself to you 🔥
Lol ahaha if it was green it would have been stealth camping, any other colour and it’s trespass 😂super video mate 👍👍
That looks like the play tents I used to put up in the garden for my kids! Always a bit of a squeeze when you're 6'3" with size 14 feet 🤣
lol too small of a tent for me then standing at 6ft 3,
.🤗
Probably a homeless/refugee person might like it.....
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💪💪💪💪💪💪👍😎🌄🌄🌄🌄🌄🌅🌅🌅🌅🌅🇦🇩🇦🇩🇦🇩🇦🇩🇦🇩🇦🇩🇦🇩
Bit different this vid...but still very entertaining...i spent 2 nights in the lakes in a tent that cost 50 big ones...i know how you felt trying to get the poles in the corners...😂😂
you would absolutely fall in love with the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington. Pine trees for as far as you can see.
Why are you so obsessed with not “being seen” ? Then posting on YT?
It did its job, I guess, providing the temp was OK outside it would keep you dry ish and insect free. The little pegs might be an issue if it was windy, but at least you could be found if you blew away.
Grab a camo net, breaks up the tent pattern in woods and such, pretty cheap way of blending in.
I love using this tent in the summer, I have found june-august it's light and simple and has no condensation issues :) However mine is green so it's less glaring haha
I've got an asda  ,£10 tent. Had it ten years and never used it 😅😅
Get a Camo tarp and cover it. When Longs Drugs went out of business I bought a really nice spacious 2 person tent. Claire keep the videos coming  I love them.
That howl was like American werewolf in London, I'd have been outta there! 😂
lol , my lad has this same tent ( DoE , weekends away with grandparents VW camper , occasional beach camp with pals ) .. he's about 5'6 & is getting a new , bigger , with porch tent soon  ... they really are play tents for kids
Good  Work  Claire
Are you  ex army atvb Jimmy 😎😎👍👍
Camouflage netting over the tent would have done the job of concealing it  Claire .
I have never in my life looked at a tent and thought “Well that’s pretty cute”.
It's so cheerful though. Lol.  At the correct time, in the correct situation, under the correct conditions, I'm positive that it will be the perfect tent. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Lovely Claire.  Yeah You  are  Quin
It only shows, that a tent can be too cheap and too small, and all the worlds tarps and other add-ons cant change that. Good to learn.
A brown tarp and a some camo netting!
Stealth camping in a bright red tent...🤭 Would maybe make a good day hiking emergency shelter?  I tried sleeping in a single skin tent in very subzero temperature once, as I couldn't find a spot for my hammock & it was raining a lot...woke in the wee hours realizing i was literally freezing...the tent was covered inside and out with ice. I decided I had to move or likely die of hypothermia, so I packed up as quick as I could and pushed my bike for miles..it was my feet that were dangerously cold - I knew that walking would increase the blood flow to my feet - it worked! My feet gradually warmed so I could feel them again & I escaped frostbite. I was VERY glad to see sunrise that day!
I think you are amazingly brave and amazing too.
Thats..., RED! Some construction-/work-signs around and it would look like some work area 😆 I only feel comfortable with low-wis equipment.
God, you are smart and smoking hot.  Also sharing all this great info.  Thank you.
*_Hello beautiful Claire, I miss your adventure videos, especially your beautiful aura and your adventure gear, always be healthy and successful, dear. greetings from Indonesia_*
Why are you so scared of being seen?
Not sure that little tent would have survived anything more than light rain Claire.   Probably not one for a mountain or winter 😂
You always leave me with a smile on my face. Thanks, Claire.
Such a choccie addict 😆
You find street homeless people use them a lot because they're so cheap and often get donated by well meaning people. The only problem is, as you pointed out Claire, the condensation. The tents have proved to be virtual killers for the homeless in winter. Already with damp clothing, sealed up in the tent, condensation build up causing damp sleeping bags. The temperature plummets and they don't wake up, being wrapped in a giant ice pop virtually.  Interesting video Claire.
As a dumb American, when you said "Bright red 21 pound tent" I thought wow that's heavy lol But I slowly understood shortly thereafter. 21 pounds is $26.25 USD. Regardless, I love your content keep it up!
Well, I had to double-check the date of this video, when I saw you in the inexpensive, RED, "2-man" tent! Then, when I saw that it was, indeed released, just two hours ago, I thought to myself, "What in the world are you doing in a tent like that when you have your wonderful Hilly?!" You explained your reason behind it, saying that you just wanted to experience a night out in an inexpensive tent. Ooooookay! 😁 I have to say, you sure had me wincing, when you were trying to put that FIBERGLASS tent pole in the pocket! It was like watching someone blowing up a balloon, when the balloon is stretched to the limit! Hahahahaha! I'm glad you made it. You did a fine job hiding that "Bright Red Stealth Tent." 😁I was quite surprised. All-in-all, it was another very enjoyable video.  After watching your hour-long video, with no dialog, then watching this one, I was reminded how much I enjoy hearing your lilting, "G'night!" and soft, quiet, "Morning!" in your videos. All part of the wonderfulness that is you, Claire! Thanks once again, for making my heart smile! ❤~Russ
Hi Claire, been following your adventures, nice to see your testing some cheaper options, we would all like to be able to buy the best, but not always possible, still great content.
I’ve had two cheap tents first one leaked and was awful. But I bought a Vango Soul 300 for cycle touring a few years ago on offer for £35, it’s been fantastic survived a few really bad storms. The only issue with it is similar to yours only a tiny vestibule, which is too small to cook in. But for weekend or even a week out on the bike it’s fine.
I use a Pro Action from Argos cost me £25 in Grey not produced now ! Better sleeving for poles and door Obviously all the problems of a small single skin tent But works to the point that I do not feel I need an upgrade for English stealth camps 🙂😘
You struggled with the second pole because it was the lower pole… it wouldn’t flex as well as it was pushing against the higher pole…best to do the lower one 1st . Blimey it is bright red isn’t it.. 😮
now you tubers will do budget gear or maybe not
21 pounds too much. Looks like something you pick up from the 2 dollar or reject shop here in Australia.
im awaiting the sheep to follow you see loads are doing the haunted ghosts camps good your the sheperdess bit
You are brave for  this time of year in one of those!   Have had a very similar tent from the Tesco Value range that I picked up for about £7 about 14 years ago.  Used loads over the years for dumping stuff from the camper van in like child car seats pushchairs etc but hardly ever for sleeping in.  That was a dark blue one (with light blue hat)  in Tesco colours so a bit more stealthy than yours :-),   Still usable with no rips after all this time although the elastic on the little square hat is stretched and no longer elastic.  Also someone broke a pole once mistreating it so we paid about the same as what the tent cost originally to replace a section.  Kit stored in it stays pretty dry although the rain sometimes gets in the door opening.  Fantastic value for what I needed it for.
It’s not the size that counts. Aslong as it’s practical that’s  main thing, abit like a boyfriend haha
I saw one in home bargains for £14 today! I wouldnt trust that as a toilet tent though!
Not too bad for a cheap tent in very bright red cool watch enjoyed it
Your new nickname is now going to be camo Claire 😂. Interesting to see a cheap tent test. Looks like it’s more a throw away festival tent or maybe a beach tent in summer.
It is funny as a stealth tent... Quite possibly the brightest-colored tent humanly possible 🤣 Just adds to the challenge, right?
You should have spent £21 on some food 😂🤗
The last tip was brilliant, taught me something :)
More proof of, you get what you pay for
I'd leave it right where it is when you left, or I'd have put pine branches all over it.
love youre videos always fun and relaxing and beautifull nature
Ty for more fun videos Claire very enjoyable
I can beat that £15 tent Aldi...ok a two season tent last year but was water proof as it pissed it down...
Brilliant. That was very humorous.  Could you try putting your light weight tarp over it ? It would camouflage it a little better. 10 out of 10 for serving the night 😂
❤. Well that was fun.  Good thing you didn’t have to pitch that bad boy in a howling gale.
You’re like the nigella Lawson of camping
Your so beautiful!!
We have that tent to use as extra storage space for the campervan on the longer trips out. Boots, BBQ, chairs, dog beds, bike accessories etc all get thrown in.  I did wonder if anyone would actually use it to camp with.  Now I know 🤣 Thanks Claire 🤣
Haha, bought similar from ASDA. Total rubbish but good fun! And yeah, it's such a tight fit it's coming apart and loads of condensation, lol.
i got a 2 man tent from halfords with a front vestibule was brilliant and it rained quite heavy, so i went into the house.
I de-stress and feel chill when watching your videos. Thank you 🙏
Looks like best part of that tent is how easy to flat out. Still decent 1 person tent for that price I guess 😊
Haha Claire! What cute little tent 😂🤣 half my body would stick out!!! 😂🤣😂🤣 nice to remind people that they don’t need expensive gear to have a little cheeky wild camp, nice one lovely xx
Omg Claire! No vestibule 😂😂😂😊😊
I get the whole testing it as it is, but if you had taken one of your tarps, that would have camoflaged it well. It was particularly tiny  though lol - I would have to turn myself into a pretzel to sleep in there; dunno where I would have put all my gear 🤣🤣  Thanks for the review Claire!
lol ,double entendres
👍 .. that tent sounds like, whilst on my local train, listening to a Swiss munching on a paper-bagged station kiosk-bought snack 😁. Definitely a kiddies backyard tent.
Hello ' Stands with Fist ' don't you mean ' darn sarf ' .
great video two man tent no! kids tent yes!
Are you sure it's not a Garden Play Tent.- But it's Fun !
Looking forward to cheap tent fun, touring Isle of Wight (live in Portsmouth lol) on e-bike so need light weight tend for 6’ 3” bloke if you can find one
Another great video Claire, proving you don’t need high end gear to get out for a night!
Stealth camping in a RED tent?
Laughing right off the bat,  the bright red color, the grunts and comments trying to set up the pole...But, the winds were under 25 kts this trip!!  Overall I think you did really good on the stealth part. No major disasters,  a neat night out...yea....great video Baby Beare, ty....be safe
She's so cute
"Stealth" is doing rather a lot of heavy lifting here. Might need some camo netting.
You must be mad .. camping with a Primark tent 😂
If you wanted an "authentic cheap tent experience" you should have done it without the bivvy bag etc. People who are limited to that type of tent by budget would not have expensive bivvy bags and inflatable beds etc.
I'm from the US, so when you said in your intro "21 pound tent" my first reaction to myself while seeing you holding the tent was "that thing weighs 21 pounds?!?!"  Haha
Best way to become invisible is to make people uncomfortable.  Have a sign asking for handouts or mentioning you want to talk to them about religion. People will look right through you like you aren't there or become fixated on some imaginary object off in the distance.
I don't see how they can sell it as a 2 person tent at all. I thought if you were having issues with lying down the only way to mitigate it is yo sleep corner to corner. But absolutely not 2 person. No vestibule is a no no for me. But thanks for trying it out for us Claire. The red is a no go too.
❤❤❤
I whant to go camping with you..... I have a red tent the same size for two people i just put my camo tarp over it..... You caould be ten feet away and not notice it.
If Mr Fox didn't see you and object then you achieved your aim of a stealth camp, average Hooman ain't going to spot you lol.
Nice video Claire, happy Easter and don't forget to plant eggs, chocolate, strawberry tomato and pepper plants so you and animal friends have snaks for those summer hikes!
Seems like a great cheap option for someone wanting to try camping 🙂
I’m so happy that I’m early normally I’m never early I’m late by like a week but here I am hi! 😊
If the poles are too tight to insert into the ends, its likely bound up slightly in the sleeve.
Always enjoy your videos Claire
Glastonbury one nighter. Strictly for nobby no mates & the socially awkward.
Hi Claire out of 10 how do you rate the tent and are you planning on using it again
You need a pop up tent. Automatic.
the dome pop up version has plenty of room ....but defo not water proof 😄
In scandinavia there is no need for stealth camping. We have the right of public access
Not sure you quite understand what stealth camping is Claire!
Best stealth camp on YouTubes. Love it.
I love your channel ❤
You da best bear 🐻 🙏🏼😊
these are the type of tents that get used once and binned. Im not a fan they are just fodder for land fill
Next time.  Please stake the tent down first.  It makes it so much easier.
That was ace Claire and your camouflage was a great idea too!🌲⛺️🌳👍🏼
Yay the jump ending is back : )
It sounds like a crisp packet 😮 Good video for those trying it out on a budget. 😀
Cracking little tent Claire, I did a camp on Fan y big last year in one and had a blast
I have slept under trees, in the open, under a tarp and in a cave. I have not slept in a tent in maybe 55 years. This reminds me why.
That red tent! Turns out, studies have shown that red light helps the body release nitric oxide, a signaling molecule that helps our cells manage blood pressure levels. 🤣
I enjoy this type of reviews. You took it out and really showed some of the shortcomings . I would hope that the setup will go easier next time 👍🤗🎩
Oof 😍
The Foxy lady pulls it off again. Bushyboy Oz
Thanks for this little adventure Claire, I could get the grandkids such a tent for a similar “close to home” adventure.
A pop up tent is the one I go camping with amazing tents open the zip and the tent shoots out
Where is your accent from?
love this keep up the adventures!!
I believe they come in bright colours too 🤣
Nice video
Thanks for taking us along on another adventure!  I enjoy the 'everyman' gear that someone who might not be familiar with camping out would use.  When I got back into camping, just over a year ago I was wildly impressed with my little Amazon tent.  As it turns out I got lucky.  While it isn't perfect (what tent is) it was surprisingly good!  It's a little free standing tent, similar to what you have there, but it's got a full rain fly.  It's also SilPoly so doesn't sag when wet and is a double-walled tent for a little less weight than you have with the tent you used here.  It also has a rather large vestibule.    A company called Rakaia (which I guess has gone out of business) sold it.  I imagine that some other 'company' has picked up the design since I'm sure it was just an off-the-shelf Chinese offering.  I'll link the tent below, though it shows unavailable.  It is a little shorter than I'd like, but it's long enough for my 78" long/wide pad (just) and there's a bit of room on the side; of course that's the inner tent you're close to, so there's not nearly the condensation issue.  I actually liked it so much I got a couple of them.  The first time I bought it I think I paid in the $85 range, but as the company started to fold I got two more for under $60 each.  Aside from being bright orange, which I liked at the time, I think it's got a lot going for it.  In fact, if you'd like me to send one to you to try out let me know.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089NY6QWS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1  As I started to do more hiking, I started to want a trekking pole tent, and the Six Moon Design Skyscape seemed perfect.  You can get the SilNylon version (the Scout model) for $160.  The Trekker SilPoly version is lighter, but more expensive, but still an amazing tent (I still hold this would be a great tent for you for warmer weather).  Ultimately, I moved to a Lunar Solo which is great but for my super-light (not quite ultra-light) I tried out the Gatewood Cape/Serenity Net Tent combo which for a solo-outing is amazing.  Super light, double-walled shelter.  There's only enough room in the net tent for your pad, but the vestibules on either side (and you can get to both) are huge, though you can only access one from inside the mesh tent.  Might be a thought; have a look at it.
hello claire <3 i send you hugs
6,3ft I would be screwed! 😂 different video but nice I enjoyed it
Use it in a campsite in the summer months in France… not the Lake District in Winter.
Yeah every 10th I've ever bought from Amazon being the cheapest one that I could find I've always returned them except for 1 that I finally just kept just for the heck of it for a quick throw up here there but I'm only 5' 7 and I always just sleep on the diagonal in there
🙌🏻
Woww you cute 😘🥰🌺🌹⚘️💐
I'm 6'5, that might shelter my head😁😆😆😆
Be careful,  a tent pole  under tension can be very stabby!
Honestly Iv bought eurohike gear for people who were camping only once or twice with me. Not the worst brand.
We paid 30 for this tent.we went to skye and it was great but last week in glencoe got absolutely soaked and frozen.obvs it's not really for this time of year.would say not really fitting 2 people, I'm really short and we struggled xx
Good Camp! But couldn't you get a Cammo design instead of a red tent?
Very nice. Definitely not a 2 person tent. Barely a 1 person tent.  Thx for the vid. Until next time. 😎👍
Claire is snug as a bug in a rug...lol. (nevermind the red hue coming from that hilltop at 9pm, its just a Woodland nymph)  Great video Claire 😎👍❤️
Best thing you can do with that tent is use it for a rubbish bag Hun 💓
What was your thinking that led to you wanting to camp in a cheap red tent?
Still beautiful as always ❤️ 💕 💖
The pick me up we all need
Always make me smile. Thank you wild one. Bye…
This video shows why I always get a tent that is double walled, with a vestibule, and bigger than me so I don't touch the walls. It makes no sense to get a lightweight tent if you have to bring a bivy to stay dry, the bivy makes your total weight heavier than just having a better tent.
Do not leave your boots outside.
I had one just like that except blue and grey and lived in it from July till October last yr and had all-sorts of rain wind frost etc but I managed ... condensation wasn't too bad ...I'm 5'6" just long enough width was fine . All round it was ok for the money . I agree red is too much 😂
Hahaha very cool vid. 👍⛺
Almost spat my dinner out laughing at the hillenberg comment 😂
I have the same tent in cammo and being 6 foot tall it is a bit tight.
I bought one of those tents....used it on a very blustery night in Snowdonia. Woke up on the Isle of Wight. Beautiful sunrise though.
Good job with the camouflage 😅
Sadly, a lot of cheaper tents are measured as "how many sardines will fit at once", rather than "how many people will comfortably fit in here". I wish they would change this approach. A basic rule i use is to double the people. So, i'd buy a four man tent to sleep two people with all their gear inside.
How is this thing so LOUD!?😂 even the baggy for the poles sounded loud haha. LOVE YOUR CHANNEL❤
Thats the first tent I have ever seen fight back!
Let’s just rename this tent the sillyberg no no.  😉
Claire. You're a nutter! Camping in the equivalent of Barbie's first tent. It made me claustrophobic jest watching you.
I bought a Eurohike DLX 2 man tent for motorcycle camping. About 45 quid I paid. Really recommend it! Worthy of an 'expert' review by your good self I think! 👍
Most of the very cheap tents are best kept for use in the garden in summer. Having said that, I've had many tents for under £50 and only had one disaster (on heavy wind). It just takes a bit of research to find the best ones. My latest is an Eiger Trekker 1 (£40); a bit low but okay for an overnighter. 😊
Hi! What do you think of Osprey backpacks?
A braken cover or net with braken. Not sure it's going to be waterproof, ah yes, that's the way! It's going to be wet. I have a single skin tent I use in summer on the beach only. I reckon you could add a sort of vestibule to the front.
I have several similar tents I've used for week-long stays at an event for many years.  Even without guys, they've survived gale-force winds and heavy downpours. The ones with a side entrance are easier to enter than the end entrance like that one.   Given the size, it's easier to sleep diagonally.  (I'm c. 180cms taill.) Gear goes in the triangular corners. (Stout plastic bags are your friend.) A sheet of thin plastic, painter's drop sheet, or garbage bags (bin-liners) taped together laid underneath as a ground sheet mean that you dpn't have to take home a load of whatever  mud you've been sleeping on when you strike camp.   Be sure to punch small holes in it, or arrange slits, so that water can drain away. (Keep the footprint slightly smaller than the tent not to collect rainwater. ) Just roll it up for disposal.  Your camouflage was ingenious. If you couldn't use that,  you could paint  patterns on the tent, or use some burlap strips wrapped around the poles  (one end only, so they drape) to disrupt the outline
Claire, you do know that stealth is defined as a cautious, unobtrusive, and secretive way of moving or proceeding intended to avoid detection. Camping in a bright red tent is not stealthy...
Hats off to you Claire, you got away with it, love the fern wall, great video once again 👍 ❤
Great video...love seeing Mr Fox xx
Smart.  Red becomes darker & less easy to detect in low light conditions. Typically dusk to dawn leaving reader user to walk with it cross-county.  White & yellow are the only 2 colors that will not darken as light fades. In fixed locations you need a heaps of leaf or dry laid stone to hide tent.
🙂👍
What could be better than a beautiful woman out camping in a beautiful area?
Awesome videos. Love it
Another great vid, Claire.  £21 for the tent and £5 for a can of Sherwood-Green spray paint  -  sorted!! 😁
Wondering if it was a kids tent since it was so small
It's only kinky the first time 😁😁🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
You...are one of a kind.  🙂
Small camo net would make all the difference ………..
It's our Clarebeare ❤❤❤
😂😂😂👏 finally you did it.
Who didn’t have her Weetabix! Perfect, as always, thank you Claire.
I've had worse tents & worse night's tenting in torrential rain in the Lake district
When you said it was a "21 pound" tent, I (being from the US and not the UK) though "How is it even POSSIBLE to make a tent that heavy!"
Two kids in the back garden, maaaaaaybe.
It`s a perfect tent for storage, or children, but in a pinch it did work, all the best.
It's best used for a toy tent for your son. LOL
It's fun to see you camp out in that tent, I can relate. I've got a similar cheap ass tent. Mine is a two person tent (not really) so I fit really well in it, with my gear and a small bread dog. However, mine is blue??! A color you don't often see in the wild, haha. But it has served me quite well, since I'm not an extrem camper, as you are most of the time. But I really like to watch your escapades in conditions I wouldn't go near, as I'm a bit stiffer in my joints. However, I enjoy following with on your hikes in these beautiful places. Keep safe, Claire.
Hey there Lil Wild One Lots of Hare , 🐰🥚⭕️🟥🔴♥️♦️🐇You want the Red Ones ok, That’s Christian Louibouitons
I was willing you to get that last pole in 😆. El cheapo crisp bag tent.
Got the exact same tent! Much less wide than the images would have you believe!
Claire, its unfortunate that its a "red tent".  The secret is to have a cheap black covering,  cut open garbage bag, a black sheet,  over the tent before you throw over a Camouflaged net, preferably with TWO camo nets each different. Then you throw on local brush to blend it in.  I've done this and been 3 meters from a walking trail and no one ever spotted the tent. I've taken pictures and no one yet has been able to see in the picture where the tent was.  Done correctly it blends in so no one can see it even when they are looking at it.
Claire's comfort & cozy videos are the best 🤗
Haha 2 man tent, 2 kids maybe.  Fun video Claire. Definitely a tent for summer fun. I know tesco do some cheap tents, have fun with the condensation. Fair play Beare. Always fun, and inspirational videos. Keep Loving the Adventure 💚
Hi 🐻, that's the brightest tent ever lol . Cracking camouflage wall ! HAPPY DAYS
21 squids is a fabulous price..
Shame Mr fox didn't stop for a chat.
Bright red for sure lol
Wow, that's like $26 and a quarter US
Good effort....That groundsheet played havoc with my speakers 😆
I think hilliberg don't have to worry about this one.😂
Great work Claire 😊👍
Definitely needs some camo netting.
Like the camo wall. Also the gas lantern.
This is not a good tent.  But the movie is very good.  Regards
I have used cheap decathalon tents and been surprised with their quality.
Fun video.   I also like for my gear to "blend in" with my surroundings.  My current backpacking tent had to be special ordered to get an olive green color, it blends in well Summer or Winter.   Thank you for another great video.
Hehe, I used a very similar tent for quite some time, but i covered it with a camo tarp to avoid detection, keep condensation down and have room for my fishing gear and stuff like that. I had to sleep diagonally in it, but I kind of miss it actually xD
Another amazing video by a very amazing woman
hottest girl on youtube for real
You need camo and a Bright color one not to be seen and one in case you need to be seen.
Claire,  you are very brave.  You take a cheap tent and make it seem like a palace. You are a queen at improvising. Stay Beautiful, ingenious, and safe.
Would never buy a stealth red tent.
you are amazing :)
Thanks for the video…you always find great places to pitch…stay safe !! ( the green leaves 🍃 with the pointy corners) do you know what they are ….
Youre back 😊
I had the eurohike tamar 2 that cost me 20 quid.  It was bright red too.  It was great in wet weather and I only got rid of it because it faded to pink in the sun and I am not sleeping in a pink tent.
Yeah!! Stay safe 😅 Loving it!
hi
That’s rather bright to be stealthy. 😂🏕🏕
1st...🐌
WildBeare rules! Woooo
👍🏻
