How to do u do the trait?
I have him and jones. They are beast in the midfield
Renato ad CAM or Vidal as CAM?
i got paulinho untradble do i need do  vidal sbc or its similare player
This guy is seriously struggling to pronounce El Shaarawy properly 😭
now the big question is renato or vidal
How does Nick know everything about Fifa apart from how chem styles work?
Got engine on him and its insane. So much more agile as with shadow
should i do nedved or him?
KDB TOTGS or this Vidal?
how do you do this "drag back" at 09:37?
Same Price as sabitzer wtf 😳
Vidal: Simple touch, simple 2 yard pass Nick: Great touch, unbelievable pass.
Those glasses do not suit you at all... do not wear them again 😂
Nice! Like your flair-type of fifa-playing!
Play at CB in game 🤌🏻
I have prime gullit who would you recomend using as a cm
4-3-3(5) with him and Rooney at CM 😍
Birthday not birthdaye
get pim zambrotta as a cm or save my fodder and get vidal (can do both for free)
Is SIF hakimi a good RM in 352? he is the only way i can link vidal
Rashford or sterling at left wing ? Can someone pls help
Nick umm your in div 2 dunno if that really effects the review but just thought I'd point it out
Do prime icon moments matthaus
I feel like im going to use him until the end of the game
Should I do him or prime ballack for my CM??
As a Chilean arsenal fan this promo is literally taking everything from me
Vidal or Bruno 92 next to TOTY kimmich ???
Do players lose chemistry when swapped in formation tab? Looks like El-shaarawy would have 0 in 4-1-2-1-2 formation. I'm new.
Do you think Kimmich TOTY is better than Vidal Fut Birthday? I would play one of the two as a defensive CDM next to Bruno Fernandes POTM 92.
not bad
Do you think i should do him, id use him with 91 Lothar as 2 CMs or 2 CDMs?
Is he better than kante?
do you guys think he would work with FB thiago in 2 cm’s in a 442
Is Vidal on 7 Chem better than Curtis Jones on 10 chem??
He looks fucking cracked, amazing dribbling, insane passing and has the strength of a brick wall, sick finishing and 4 star weak foot. Cracked.
9:39 how do you do that skill?
Should I complete him when I have Curtis Jones or is it a waste of coins then?
I packed Perisic, worth doing this beast?
Thanks for the video
Is he better than Jones future stars ?
this guy is an absolute beast. The Chilean Gullit
I completed him with what I packed in 25 83+ and some Foda, bye bye Curtis Jones
Him or mid Gullit, if I do him who should be the more attacking midfielder ?
I’m not really sure please who should I get Vidal or thiago?
We are waiting for giroud the king
Where are the commenters from Thiago's review? He always gives 8s to players. This rating meant to determine the best of the best right?
Traded my mahrez and Kuluski for this card and he is 100 perecent worth it
he is so insane, i played with moments boateng for along time, but lately he start get out pace alot, so i put boateng in sbc for this card and omg its worth, ( i have bender and klooster cl card now )
Vidal or rooney as a box to box
Why does the gameplay look so quick
If you can, just get fut birthday Sambia for cdm is the same type of player just way cheaper
would you recommend to link with perisic? perisic seems like the pain in here.
realy realy nice ?
Him or prime ballack guys?
Why no moments Eto’o ?
can you review lees melous upgraded?
92 POTM Bruno and FBD Vidal at CDM in a 4231?
im interested when will EA turn this card off( as the other cards )
You use great background music bro
Thiago or Vidal?
him or fb Thiago?
him or jones
Can someone tell whats the skill move at 4:22
What’s ur thoughts on podolski? I just did him and ozil and don’t know what formation to play to fit him in with robben and crespo
Fuckkk, this card looks so good I have 670k but invested in Putkammer informs :( I hope that Putkammer raises high quickly to make the sbc or  get fodder somehow to do him
Nick talking about Vidal needing a special card. Few days later Vidal gets a special card. Nick=illuminati 👀
too slow
It hurts my eyes seeing Kaka with an Inter Milan kit 😔
Absolutely gonna do this man
Packed cr7 today so had to do this card for the soft link!
WOW
Catalyst on him???
I have kessie should I sell him and do Vidal ?
hse basically a cheap gullit. hes endgame material
got about 50 pp, might end up doing him if i pack enough fodder (gotta complete Podolskis 85 sbc too) and play vidal next to Mid Lahm, this card just looks so good
Yoo Can I have that MS indicator on xbox ?
Now we need a special Alexis card for the perfect link.
You should try and review these cms as one of 2 cms in a 442 the cms are under more pressure
Should I do vidal or just buy kante and save the coins?
Guys I need your help, El shaarawy and Vidal Or Rooney and Curtis Jones ?
Better then makelele? :)
Anyone know if you can spend ikon swaps 2 tokens for ikon swaps 3 rewards when they are released? I'm not thrilled with baggio so trying to wait to see who is in 3
End of an era aguero incoming
Yo nick do you have kaka to come back on defence?
I'm just gunna pretend he's freddy guarin from those old school fifas
BTW FUCK VALORANT
Doesn’t matter what chem style you like you’d always end up with hunter or shadow. Not anyone’s fault it’s just how the game works.
Is perisic any good. Only way I’d do this sbc
Honestly put perisic up top with ronaldo and have a finisher on him 93 rated striker on Futbin and have neymar cam one of the most lethal 3 attackers
Really want this card but he won't link into my team and I'm really not arsed spending loads and changing my team around to fit one player in 😂
I dont play this fifa but this card looks filthy
Rttf renato sanches or vidal??
He’s basically just matthaus with 5 star skills then ?
Perfect for my Seria A Team!! 😍 can’t wait to get him.
Do sane fut birthday
I am going to throw this out now.... I know it’s early and only played 6 games with him... hands down one of the best cards I have used in 10 years of ultimate team. High/high, unique body type, 5 star skills, next level passing, great shooting. Man is the package
should i replace my IF renato sanches with this guy? i have the fodder, and it helps with my chem.
I mean if you put him on stay back I'm sure he'll do a job at cdm
I been waiting for this before I touch the sbcs
would he be better cm paired with prime xavi in a 3-5-2??
I've been using this card all evening and the guy is an absolute machine. Just runs non stop and seems to turn up in the positions you need him in at all times
5 star skills tank midfielder 100% doing this.
Could you do vardy please?
What camera does he use???
Vidal on 7 or thiago on 10 in a 3-5-2 next to FB Dest?
Bros can anyone tell me what are the camera settings of nick?
Podolski ???
what did you think of perisic? is he good or no?
Should I do him or makelele pim for the defensive cm Role ?
You are using 91 yashin Nick. Honest opinion? For me, he is the best GK in the game 🙌🏼
All the good cards starting to come out and I’m heading out to basic training RIP To My One Punch Account
Him or gulit 90 please answer?
End game card periodt...
Will go nicely  next to my prime Essien
I want a Braithwaite fut birthday
TODAYe I thought HEYe let’s do Vidal
This vidal card is amazing. If you can fit him in his worth doing has it all. Even though his 500k he brings a lot to the table and one you can use for a while.
Can you please do a machis review?
I’d rather kessis at CM OR CDM because he’s tradeable
I think he forgot this Vidal is left footed lol he took all the shots with his week foot  Edit: never mind i just realized he’s not left footed smh
I’m really not excited about this content right now.. lest year we had fut birthday players that were ENDGAME! This year non of them even gets in my team( maybe mendy) Terrible promo so far for me
Doesn’t fit into my team sadly..
I’ll pass on this card, I got Lees-Melou.
I packed Perisic from the Vidal sbc, can’t wait to use them both
you making it hard not to do this sbc 😂
when Nick says 9.7 you know something is up because he never rates a card under 94 really high up
Feels like I’m playing x2 speed
Would you say Vidal is endgame?
Vidal or moments makelele next to jones future stars?
HELP PLEASE   I have 1.1-1.3m coins to spend on an Icon ST/CAM after the Vidal SBC. Who should I buy, and recommendations please? I’m thinking Moments Luis Hernandez, Moments Crespo, Moments Zola, Moments Owen or Moments Van Basten. If you guys have tried anyone who’s really good then PLEASE let me know! Thanks!
Fifa 19 flashback Vidal was insane, good memories
is he good as a atacking cm?  love to you bro💪❤
Diehard Milan fan, but I gotta cop this VIdal! Thanks for the quick review Nick, much appreciated!
vidal or zambrotta moments cm ?
Worth selling Toty kdb and using Vidal ?
Nick with the smood Auzio far passes!
Hahaha, you are getting ridiculously fast with these reviews. Pls dont stop 🙏👌👍
"BIRTHDAYe"
This came out literally seconds after I submitted the final squad. I'm praying that he is good in game
Him or Moments Pirlo?
Please can you do huntellarr please
Is he worth it if he will come on straight away on 5 chem from the bench next to fb Thiago?
I like that title.
Stopped watching oprah for this
SUB TO ULTRAMEME
Day 12 asking if we can get a moments Owen review because of the 5 star wf
Nick do you think that the way the sbcs are going in this cycle we'd get more sbcs that are this good this low or you think this is a one off.
Vidal looks saucy 😤😤
R.i.P 1 million coins Freeze Firmino owners
I’m expecting to see at least one volley from this man based on the title
Lets gooo, hope you all good
BirthdayE? Lmao 😂
