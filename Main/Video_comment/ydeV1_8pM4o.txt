The Dream of my life; Recreate the same exact things shown on this Masterpiece. I want it recorded.
Sexy time in Fayetteville North Carolina on my front porch Bong Ripzzzz
I can’t believe this is three years old now 😭 I’ll forever remember staying up all night until 7am just to hear this masterpiece   Gizztober lives on in our hearts loll
He's truly the hottest man alive.
“Ice V” sounds like the name of a moon
This is how I dance around my town too.
I like songs about books. And cats cradle is my favorite Kurt vonnegut books.
Lucky 7
I can’t believe this video is free
🆘🆘🆘 You removed all of your music from Spotify — 27 albums, live tracks, and compilations. The reason was the investment of the platform's head, Daniel Ek, in the production of AI drones for the Helsing company, which supplies them to Ukraine🙏🏻♥️. He invested 600 million euros in this through his fund.  But there is a nuance: none of them removed their tracks from Yandex Music, a service linked to the Russian Federation, available in Belarus, Kazakhstan and the occupied territories. In Ukraine itself, Yandex is banned.  Drones for the protection of Ukraine - a reason for boycott. Working for the market of the aggressor country - why not? Double standards? Shame on you!👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
This songs makes me feel like I’m in the black dynamite movie
*Joey Walker has breached containment*
theres something so enchanting about this music video. ive come back to watch it so many times. go white boy go
I just got done making an outdoor summer shower that is heated by a campfire, first song i thought to put on....
The live chat thirsting over joey will never not be funny
Sexy time
cant believe there was 4 ices before
Boy's got moves
This video makes a very hard case out of "I Hate Dancing"
I tihnk it's funny the only reason we got this masterpiece is because the rest of the band flew back to Australia yet Joey choose to stay in Greece. They had already paid for the film crew, so Joey just walked around Greece being Joey and they filmed it.
This is one of the best clips I ever saw ❤
Wow good i nice
8:17 wow, what a frame
I always play Ice I-IV EP before listening to this, which admittedly is not canon.
alfred yankovic wants his look back :D
7:30 Good old Australian break dance representation
Nice and groovy song
🧊👺🔥
So awesome they hired a dancing comedian for this video
Anybody know where this was shot? thanks
Let's be more like Joey
still their best music video. i love their more artsy and jason galea-y stuff, but the pure swag this exudes is unparalleled
This bro chilly and uncare vibe give me feel so sigma, now I'm happy🥸
This might be the best KGATLW Music Video  3 Words...  FUCK. YEAH. JOEY!
What music genre is this?
Love the way the character enhjoys solitude. Like life is that good that I don´t give a shit. That's how you enjoy a beach day.
Did he just a strawberry with the stem included at 5:02 ???
Not my favorite KGLW song, but possibly one of my favorite videos of all time. I want to be him in this video.
If only this guy went to the Olympics instead of Raygun
когда поехал в отпуск один без детей и жены
Legend has it he's still grooving to this beat in Greece
How I’m moving in 2025
One of the coolest music videos ever made. His dance moves together with the song makes me feel some strong sensations.
LET THIS MAN COOK
what a stud
This never track goes hard
i hear joey now owns this island
And I always thought my uncle from Coolgardie was crazy geez... He'd warn me about wearing crocs with white socks. Said it 'makes you lustful for rock outcroppings'.
I like to think this is what nirvana feels like
If Joey was a narco boss in the 80s, this is what he would do in his free time
Joey has become a myth in Ydra.
Sexy joey dancing like a champ

I'll soon be visiting Crete and I'll be listening to this nonstop guaranteed

I love a lot of music genres but I do really hope I meet the band so I  can thank this magical band for all the love that they spread
Goddamn... The best "WhOOoo" i've ever eard.
I wish i could have this kind of vibe/energy for my whole life
Yes short catchy songs!!!! Classic vibe
I might like dancing
masterpiece
Spetses🏖
I’ll have what he’s having.
its called meth in us
"What's the script for the video?"  "uhhh, go be a goof ball and we will film you from afar."  "Perfect!"
In another reality Joey is a 1980s coke dealer in Miami or at the very least portraying one in a film.
always thought they were singing "vespaaa vespa." <3
I can't lie... This may be a contender for their best track...
You had me at the sexy legs at 0:18. Overall perfection. Chef's kiss.
Csm me rei fuerte con este videeeoo, pero la secuencia contraluz con puesta de sol al final es CINE 🚬
Ydra(ΥΔΡΑ)island is a greek island so beautiful..man he dances his soul out under the hot sun of this great country.
I think Joey Walker fits perfectly into Joey. They look a lot alike and you can feel the apreciation Walker has for the character. They are virtually the same person.
“Fear is a freezing gulf that flows like lava through the Mariana Trench into your bed, blossoming into a nightmare, pinned under the weight of Ganymede. Fear is a serpent that screams in your ear forever saying, “You’re next… at the abattoir.”
Napoleon Vegemite
Anyone else getting big River vibes? I’d love to hear a sandwich of the two
Prolly their best song.
Ice Bath
Excelencia
This song is actually such heat
imagine being a joey stan on the day this came out
It's hard to believe that this is the same guy that sings the Latin part of Dragon
6:14 truly one of the moments of all time
Really interesting
hpow does he not trip over and fall flat on his face onto thge ground in those crocs ?
Ice V aka “How my Greece voyage went”
Best Dancing Scene since Thriller ⭐🧟⭐🧟
Gotta love a cat lover. Go on, Joey. Get yer groove on, maaaaaan.
I'm on a logging crew and the guys thought I was crazy today dancing to this while running a saw.  Lol Can't help but move your feet when listening to this beat.  Oh yeahhhh
His friends call him the Aussie John Travolta.
Imagine if Nacho Libre had eagle powers
was this filmed near Angelsea?
He's just like me!
Hielo cinco, hielo cinco...
This is why Joey is my favourite gizzard
this: (wikipedia) Ice V, pronounced "ice five", is a monoclinic crystalline phase of water, formed by cooling water to 253 K at 500 MPa. It has a density of 1.24 g cm3 (at 350 MPa).[1]  Ice V has a complicated structure, including 4-membered, 5-membered, 6-membered, and 8-membered rings and a total of 28 molecules in the unit cell.[2][3] Ganymede's interior probably includes a liquid water ocean with tens to hundreds of kilometers of ice V at its base.[4]
whenever i go for a walk while wearing sunglasses this song plays in my head
literally me.
I show my friend this video and they then decide they want to make love to their shadow after Joey Walker kisses his shadow. 🤨
fela gizzard kuti
Looks like Sanos Island, Greece. Where Pythagoras, the quasi-divine Philosopher, was born I think that Stu has a lot of influence on this philosophical current and that would partly explain Polygondwanaland.
I like to think they filmed the dancing first then the music from watching him
I must gain a mustache.
Very cool !
That's me after mental breakdown, thinking I've recovered forever
Please come play this at my Rennfest!
The repeat button in this one is broken It has a cool ring every time you hite it lol
Beach episode?
props to everyone involved, perfectly captured the essence of the song
Looks like they got their hands on some vintage 70s film
Toro y Salsa
what can i say
Me: I'm sad  KGLW: you were
Like 70's vibe and I like it! ❤
King Gizzard karate kidding in Hydra wasn't in my bingo card for this year and it should've been honestly.
A white endless void that I conceived as bring 'God' talked to Me one time and just said to play more  Joey's out here playing more
The air keyboard solo is fucking marvellous lol
I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG!
They should teach this at school
Fav. Gizz video
This video has swagger
fun fact: there is big buttocks at 5:12
Gracias a una sugerencia de Spotify descubrí esta banda. Me recomendó el último disco y me voló la cabeza, me volvieron a volar la cabeza al darme cuenta que los otros discos son diferentes a PetroDragonic.  Los amo! Aguante Gizzard! 🤩😍💗
Joey do be walking
This is how it feels to chew 5 gum
I wanted the cat to follow him so badly
jeeeza > what a wisdom && freedom, ThX
couldn't breathe after 4 minutes I was laughing so hard
this man is so cool
spongebob walk cycle ass music video lmao
he walk'n
sesame street ass song (affectionately)
With this new look Joey looks like:  - A late 70s porn actor - A GTA Vice City drug dealer  Can't decide! 😂  Awesome song, as always btw
So many gifs should be made from it....
Just so groovy with just a dash of porn or something, sexy
Greek kamaki from the 80s, vibes!
This might be the closest thing we will ever get to a perfect music video
thanks for all the great songs!
Melhor vídeo do mundo pra ver chap4d0. Que viagem incrível 🍀🚬🤤
So we are missed the ice cream
Just fcking love Joey
Every six months I’ll marathon the discography and I see now that my likes are being removed
Listened to this song for 3 hours straight one time while driving back home at 3am from a camping trip after I got jump scared by a black bear while coming off acid
This is actually just a really good Mythos beer commercial
This clip is pure fun.
peak
intro reminds of me of SOBE III's intro
i love the story telling you get from this film
If You accidently-somehow-anyhow push the play button and this song starts. You can not escape. The pure genius gonna tie you up you are done :D Th next thing you notice is you are a KGATLW fan.
I think he likes dancing
They really made a song about Ice Spice huh
Great video and song, but I just remembered the time I was telling my friends about this band and one of em just replied with "king jizzard and the lizard jizzer" and I was crushed.
Watching the energy this man has makes me feel like an anemic sloth
I was meant to be born Australian but something in the matrix didn't compute
What in the funky fried chicken did I just watch?!?!?! I am physically exhausted and fulfilled at the same time. This, hands down, may be the best thing I have seen or heard in my entire existence. Holy Lizard, that was an experience. Thank you, thank you and thank you. Please come again. 🦎
dont be suprized
I want to dance this song so bad tonight. I hope they play it today in Prague
BEST video ever🤩
ice v 🗣️
I'm glad I got to witness a professional guitar player's air guitar and I'm not insecure about mine anymore
Best thing since sliced bread
Aftersun, director's cut
4.16.. best segment in music videos ever!
When all else fails, there will always be this video.
Aftersun (The Happy Cut)
This sounds like the soundtrack to a 70s cop show.... or is it just me?
Such a good song man pff
Been a lonnnng time since I appreciated a band this much...Thanks for keeping great music alive!
precious, thanks
That is my spirit animal
That guy danced the fuck out of that seaside village
watching this while on Ketamine changes everything. The double vision is insane
Cool. More (1969) film vibes.
yea, iceV is a concept to keep you listening and reading the comments to find out what going on,  i dont know, do you have to listen to all of it to be view.
smash
Hydra holds a special place in Australian artistic history. Writers George Johnston and Charmian Clift moved there in the 50s before it became a hip artist colony and hung out with the likes of Peter Finch, Sydney Nolan and Leonard Cohen who played theire as a totally unknown before embarking on his career.  “The Australians drank more than other people, they wrote more, they got sick more, they got well more, they cursed more, they blessed more, and they helped a great deal more,” Cohen later wrote. “They were an inspiration.”
😍😍
Jesus this is the best fucking thing to do on lsd

I don't want Haagen-Dazs I want a gizzard and the lizard blizzard
This has got to be a song in 2022
I like to think that surely, he's on mushrooms
Joey in this video is me every day. One man party.
I feel like they just give em some cid and followed him around all day while he trips out and put the music over later
뮤비 너무 귀엽다.ㅋㅋ  음악은 기본으로 잘함...!!💘
So Spacelime peacock
This video is SO good
Alright. Somebody build a time capsule. The future must remember!
aint gettin out of here alive
This video is really boring.
Fun fact: All of the stunts in this video were performed by Joey himself. There was no stunt-double on the set.
Loved the video and the cool attitude of Joey (BTW, he looks like the guy from Danny California here. Lol).
They released this video when I was tripping on acid and I just could not stop laughing through the whole video.
First time I saw the video I thought it was quite nice, just like the song, but nothing more than that. But both the video and the tracks just keep luring me back. Now I find myself needing my daily dose of this sunny piece of prog in my darkening autumn days. It's a great jam!
Can't say enough about this song
I'm rallying for this to be at the top 10 of the 2023 triple j hottest 100
❤❤❤
you can take the drums seriously!
all I can say is WOW!! this is the kind music human kind needs!
Geologists be like 5:30
I dance this way in taxi cabs but only when I know the chickens 🐓 have already been stolen   I have no eggs i tell u
Will we survive ice V
Ice Death, LD, and Changes are really some of the best work I’ve ever heard from them. Can’t believe it, their work will be studied for decades, our children will like them even more than us
what coast is this?
This band makes me feel like a child. They're so awesome, they bring me so much joy! On 2023 I'll see them for the first time, please don't cancel the show :)
I like to think that the band had a dancer booked but last minute they couldn't make it so Joey just said fuck it and did it all himself.
now im happy
Gizz making the jammiest shit out there since Jerry died
Cav's drumming is next level on this one.
moustache is ridiculous
mythos
Whelp, that's one way to make a 10 minute music video. It was pretty entertaining actually. Edit: Come do some shows in the Canadian prairies sometime. Canada's a huge place, and Vancouver and Toronto are both reallly far away. Edmonton is the closest to me, but I could make a weekend trip out of a Calgary show.
It honestly feels like this song was written based Joey’s dance, not the other way around lol
This video is incredible. I don’t want to cut my hair because I’m not a narc, but I’m seriously considering stealing Joey’s mullet and mustache combo. I think that would be a good look for my middle 30s. I don’t know if I’m bold enough though because ya know, the world is cruel. I want to be confident enough to rock that look.
Powered by Crocs
A few very strong opinions:   1. Cats are cute.  2. Comfortably the best band in the world right now who push everyone to try something new in each song.  3. Greatest drummer in the world right now?  4. Joey has full blown glown up. Getting an appointment for a perm right now.  5. How is this band able to do what they do and still have fun like this?   6. I love it.
Joey has glown up! WOW!
Joenads at 6:18
These guys are amazeballs to the MAX.  I love how they just do whatever TF they want and it always comes out NICE.
I was thinking the solo around 7:40 would sound great on bouzouki, then learnt that the songs of this album were based on the 7 greek modes. Awesome job guys!
That air keyboard solo was dead on!
I can't be the only one who thinks this dude looks like Dylan Frost from sticky fingers....?
Getting serious Napoleon Dynamite vibes from this, lads.
This is gunna be my tune for the next two years. I just know it.
This is a belter. Video and song!
Why ???
Just saw them at red rocks and holy shit these boys can put on a concert. Especially if you follow their entire discography I discovered so many other sides to gizz that I normally don’t listen as much which were heavy metal vibes and BOOGIE vibes.
esto es espectacular
Lmao I love when Joey pets the kitty
That cat speaks Greek
Think ya lens needs a wipe mate
Wearing Crocs footwear will have this effect on a person!
every time i try and play with this song my head gets stuffed with T.V. Fuzz (hmmm?)
...and he's still rockin' out to this day.
He’s absolutely the Gene Kelly of the band! Keeping up with his moves looks equally impossible!
I think I'm in love with Joey
Probably the best "WOOOH!" in the business.  Absolute magic.
holy shit this is so good!
NOW THIS SHIT I CAN LISTEN TO FOR HOURS HELL YEAH
Dance the world! Great!
They really just said “Joey be entertaining for ten minutes” and he totally delivered
Real question, does anyone know what type of sunglasses he's wearing? Specifically the lens type? Thank You!
Dancing with and kissing your shadow on a rock,I imagine this what someone tripping on shrooms would do.
4:17 the ultimate move!
Video in Greece ! wow !
fuck i thought it was Croatia .....jebem ti
still crying this wasn't played at desert daze 😭
This is the best gay porn I ever watched
🎶🌊🎶🌊🎶🌊🎶
This is one of the funniest video I have seen in a long time and iron lung. I love flying microtonal banana and I'm in your mind fuzz this album will be my 3 favorite 💣
Dude I love how all of king gizzards material now is based on subliminally telling you we are in the next mass extinction but godamn it we can still have fun and enjoy ourselves. ICE V!
Thanks You King Gizzard, now i have a new person to say "wow thats literaly me fr fr"
why is the bass so low man GIVE US MORE
-Hey Joey.. Do you have something to do this weekend?    -Sorry friend, I'm going to a Greek island the whole weekend to do gigolo dances...
Am I the only one hearing some mothers of invention vibes?
that is one good looking boy
Where was this filmed?
Se nota la influencia de la india maria, sigan así 😎
The cat Joey pet is Professor Whiskers
Dr disrespect is so cool
Mans dances
<3
kalimera!
I thought it was Weird Al
Excellent video. It coplements the feel of the music in a way that enhances it
that guy looks like bob your uncle in the 80's
Best dance moves since David Byrne in Stop Making Sense
Cologne ads if it were a song
up!
One of my favorite KGLW songs. Insane guitar solo on this one.
This is pure joy.
No damn cat, no damn cradle
Bit of Zappa-vibes, like it!
Exactly my mood at my first listening of the song
I’ve listened to this 140 times so far
this gives me serotonin ;-;
Anyone by any chance know the camera / lenses this was shot on? One of the most gorgeous looks I‘ve seen in a while!
JOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY
Yo bien cuadros soy como:
The art of not giving a f**k
Vintage porno, isnt?
2 weeks and can't stop listening, neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed the album(s)
@5:26 : Be Me: *everytime I take acid outside*
F*** it - I've got to go to Greece!!
Most interesting band in the world
I rarely sit down and listen to these guys for too long, but I have to say - I don't think they can do any wrong.
Come to Paros guys, now that you know where the islands are! Next time with a concert in company of your fans from Greece :)
this song kicks untold amounts of ass
That's probably what been addicted to cocaine and going on vacation looked like in the 80's
Ambien is a hell of a substance
Groundbreaking CGI. No one has as much of what this guy has. Not any one man ever could. Its just really good CGI.
thank you aussie's weird al
IS THIS SONG A REFERENCE TO KURT VONNEGUT'S CAT'S CRADLE - CHAPTER 20? IF ANY ONE CAN CONFIRM THIS TO BE TRUE I WOULD BE ETERNALLY ENDEBTED TO YOU. Thanks.  Love this song, by the way! 2:13 is the best part. Fucking funny video work, whoever did that.
I had three orgasms while listening to this 🥴
John Oates in 2022
IT'S ICE FIVE NOT ICE VI HOLY SHIT
Someone said this was better than tame impala they lied
I’m liking the new direction Weird Al is going!
Start sounds like gta 3 theme
That verse where you compared ISIS bombings to Steven Universe season 3 really is something else, great storytelling
Sickness with it.
Damn I wanna go back to Greece now. Best ad.
I have now watched this video a million times (I rounded up a little ) and every time it just warps my fragile tiny mind…. It makes me so happy and is such a vibe… long live the Gizz
@5:14 nice
this has no business being so attractive
https://youtu.be/rQoWV3wVRis
Cavs drumming is superb on this
This video is misogynist.  He should have a girlfriend.  Too much fun for single man
i NEED to smoke with him
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
This is the level of Unbotheredness and Freedom I want to reach someday. You're an inspiration, Joey.
I’m convinced Joey is on something during this video
This makes me feel like I see my shadow for the first time

Y’all look up Fuzz Wahh and listen to their im in your mind fuzz. Crazy underrated!
I'm not gay or even bisexual but I'm most definitely Joeysexual & God damn proud of it! I've still yet to find a single halfway intelligent organism on any of the 7 continents or 4 oceans that have the ability to resist the advances of this God amongst mere mortals of a man. I literally had to use an entire box of Kleenex & 4 pairs of socks just in the amount of time it took me to type this.
That band gives me a reason to live
My brother Lee at the beach Kevin🤣
Fela kuti meets borat and uncle rico on a vacation in Greece.
the more i listen the more i like it
… and then it just stops.
makes me want to re-read Cat's Cradle!
no place like greece
SONG EVEERRRRR OF ALL TIME
This track is pure perfection!!! 😃
Wow it must have taken alot of effort to dance in key to the tune in so many spots for so long, cool video!
can anyone ID the brand of green swimming trunks Joey is wearing?
This is really excellent. Damn. Having so much fun, then the ending hits and I'm like OOOHHHH this is profound <3
Hope I'll see you around on hydra !
Love the cum-sex-core influence in the sax playing
I just dance copied all of Joey's moves and hit my 6 month goal - I lost 10 pounds.
When listening to this…I feel like robbing a casino
Funky New álbum??? Library music in 2023 and tibetan throat Gizzard in 2024? Chiptune Gizzard in 2025? Chicha cumbia and the Wizard sabroso next week?
Joey lookin like John Oates w/ that hair + mustache combo
I listen to the music I stay for Joey's dancing
Way cheeky groovy delite ☆~`
Amazing I lovwe it My favorite musci taste its yummy
Shit like this is what killed PHiSH, just sayin.... Keep on truckin my Mama!
Groovy.
this is like a james bond movie
I gotta start livin like this dude😎 he knows what's up
it reminds me of Gong, but its great
wrst song of all time award
they drank a lot of Zappa and Mothers of Invention
I can’t believe the gizz taught me how to do cpr for 2 hours
This is the greatest video ever made
こんな生きかたがしたい
Awesome stuff, can't wait for the album!
My preemptive like for this video was well deserved.
I feel like a Deer in the headlights
the 40ft pearl dive part, amazing
😍
there's something oddly calming about joey getting sturdy all around a Mediterranean island
Very Zappa <3
This is the official training video for White Boy Summer
Someone has to be master of the seas
I can’t believe I didn’t get this choreography copy written… 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🐕
Air keyboard game is strong
5:18 and I thought I was the only one who cracked myself up while drinking
Cool for a few minutes and then goes nowhere, like most long Gizz tracks.
I haven't seen dancing that interpretive since Billy Squier did "Rock Me Tonight."
I o  ok N
Heavy afrobeat influence here
Gizz do afrobeat / funk, sick as fuck ❤
Love it
Guys just having a good time
go od songed
Ποιος Μαρσέλο και μαλακιες, αφού οι KGATLW κάναν κλιπ σημαίνει ότι πάμε μπροστά!
Tom Ripley type beat
I always thought that Joey was the most shy of them all
This band, this video, this music, this "thing" they are doing is everything! Makes my life more colorful, thank you on that!
Joey παντρέψου με
1:07 was fully expecting Joey to push that guy in the water
All this planetary horror makes me want to play KSP for some reason. What a banger!
When did the corny humour of needle drop followers start to infest the King Gizzard comment section?
I have to hand it to the band. I never expected to hear throat singing done underwater like that. Especially the animals singing. That shit was crazy.
This is very funky and very psychedelic. Gizzard never disappoints. Here's hoping they really dive into the funk side of things. I could see them doing that early 70s psychedelic funk and jazz thing very well. Shuggie Otis, Isley Brothers, Funkadelic, James Brown, Herbie Hancock.
this video is an accurate representation of what I do during a mushroom trip
Best track they've done in ages.
Aww they've got a Brittany Spaniel!
Oh man! Thank you for this one!
Man..he had so much energy in such a high temperature! Great track and videoclip
What's the point of restricting freshie videos in Russia?
im so stoned listening to this, amazing shit man I love Gizz
I would love to see the other 23 hours 50 min of footage
Shooted somewhere in an Aegean Island in the mid of Greek Summer...
The original video for this was even weirder, as it featured a flipped video screen beneath the video which initially seemed like an inventory and lyrics screen but turned out to actually be Stu Mackenzie talking to us, the viewer, from a different timeline in the past as he chronicled and spoiled the entire plot of Kotaro Uchikoshi's 'Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors'.
Man, they really gizzed on this one
Can we appreciate joey’s phenomenal moves. 4:17 is my favourite
😎
synchronized swimming - 10 points song - 10 points charisma - 10 points cat - 12 points interaction with the sun - 13 points
Why this blocked in Russia? Вы ахуели?
Never heard King Gizzard before, but King Gizzard makes me Jizzhard
the vibing man
This is the same place weird Al and I vacation
this is such a dudes rock moment
I'm not gonna say it isn't the greatest King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard music video of all time.
David axlerod vibes
Man, what a sex icon.
This song is fantastic, and the video is super fun! I’m stoked for more! Thanks Gizz! ❤️
Hell, is a fucking masterpiece
That weird al movie looks great!
joey's finally in his weird al era
Looks like a deleted scene from the classic movie musical Jesus Christ Superstar. 🤣
Stu told joe to "act cool for like 10 minutes" and this video was born
When pain stops and millions come in... trash
Howard Moon on holiday 😉
Thank you King for blessing our year. Fuck King Charles. King Gizzard for planetary king 2022! 👑
Simplismente do c*r*lhoo !!!!
This is incredible. Love everything about it.
Así se baila
Same energy, different weather: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc50wHexbwg
Every day, Joey gets closer to his final form: weird al yankovic
The way Joey pet that dog was superb... he was surely a happy doggo afterwards 💯
love it
for those who ddint know this video was shot after joey took the lives of several people at a gizz concert the footage is from greece because thats the only place that would grant him asylum. truly tragic
Gumboot soup vibes on this one
The sunset shots are so dreamy
joey got some sweet moves
What the fuck is this comment section
This track is a masterpiece, guys. I am in complete awe, my ears can analyze this thing on headphones for months, there is SO much delicious stuff happening but it's all so cohesive and well-considered and wow does it move. Out of body, out of time experience, I get lost in it.  Thank you a million times for what you do, and never stop.
Jesus Christ they popped off so hard on this one. I was NOT expecting something this groovy and danceable, this is amazing.  Also Joey just having fun at the beach made my entire week tbh.
Yas.
The reason we don’t hear much of Australia worrying about renewable energy is that, for decades, the whole country is powered by twelve guys around the continent just like this. As soon as Americans can learn this technology, we’ll all be required to attend EDC year round.
Ice Five
Phish Wizard & the Grateful Lizard
description should be saying: starring Joe Croc-ker
I found this all very attractive its quite strange
Hydra !
deep
🦎❤️
Reminds me of allman brothers, I recommend listening to their live at fillmore east album, complete jam
This is me every new KGLW drop! 🕺
When you arrive in Greece in early summer after a cold winter and rainy spring in northern Europe. :P
Its my first time listening to music, not bad
i've watched this so many times, it brings me so much joy
Amazing they got Weird Al to time travel here from the 80s to present us with his moves
Nothing like a man in some budgie smugglers.
5:26 first time he ever saw his shadow
It's going to be a good Aussie spring
Holy shit... a one hour drum solo??? You couldn't handle that shit on strong acid, man!
great thing about this band is the fact they can literally play SmashMouth's "Walking On the Sun" but call it ICE V
I must embrace Joey's energy for the rest of my life
How they got such nasty reverb out of a Tickle-Me-Elmo🤩👍
they just keep getting better.
Temon! (that is to say, great song in chilean language)
Toby fckn Powers?!? XD
I got emotional when Joey said "It's Walkin' Time!" in the song.
love the fela kuti vibes, guitar sounds like Miles Davis Dark Magus sometimes too:)
Ice wiiiine, ICE WINE
this video and song is weirdly empowering and motivational in it's own way. fuck fear. love it
October is going to be outrageous. 🙏🙏🙏🔥💯
What a funny man
Walky jaaaaaaake!!!
Αιντα μωρε
You can tell what era of gizzard it is by stu's type of "wooooo", love it.
Jim morrison like this song
So cool that Weird Al is a KG fan and agreed to appear in the video. Hilarious!
I love how this is straight up Afro-funk/ afrobeat. Fuck yes
Is that Kurtis Connor lmao
The hiccup solo is my favorite part.
2:06 Damnnnn he playin the dog!
If I was the Supreme Leader of North Korea, I would make the entire nation watch this every day.
I, too, have loved a big rock.
insane !!!
Winner 💜
I almost feel without this video, the song would be okay at best?
Wow guys I'm seriously impressed by that trap beat you somehow fit in there. And the Shoegaze influence on this track... :O
White boy got moves
This is cool but I wish they played their instruments
I followed this 10 minute exercise video and felt very refreshed and ready to take on the world.
In witch island the video took place ??
We're living in the age of micro attention spans.  KGTLW: Wanna watch 3 minutes of Joey dancing with his shadow?  Me: Yes please!!
god i love this band so much
Giving off big Napoleon Dynamite energy with this one ✊
At least The Queen could die happy after listening to the new song from KGLW
*Me, leaning out of a window* : You there boy, what day is it today?  *Boy* : Why sir, today is Gizz today!  *Me* :  Wow, so it is true! They really did it. All three albums in one night! And a wonderful Gizz day it is, too!
sooo gooooood. Channeling his Inner Borat....
Joey, get a bedroom with the slab of rock
ice track from a ice enjoyer
Hey... this looks like my videos...
my wife once again walked in and asked what sort of pornography i  was watching, so thanks, King Gizzard and your Lizard Wizard. 10 out of 10.
I feel like I’m watching Rigby from Regular Show in human form.
This is actually the first thing Han Tyumi did when he took over Munt's body before his vomit filled the universe
Best lads we luv ya in West Virginia
I love Greece, I love King Gizzard... this is the video of my life!!! 😻🤣💓🔝🇬🇷🐊
This song and video makes me want to travel the world by myself.
Fun fact: There are 20 King Gizz albums when Queen Elizabeth II is still alive
love it, can't wait to see you all next month in red rock!
More Peach Syrup for Michael Rosen.  NOICE.
This video reminds me of “Kirin J Callinan - S.A.D.” Matching energies. Time to go thrust at the sun. 😘
Maybe instead of being so prolific you can take some time to give us an album that doesn’t sound like everything you’ve done before? This is nice so far, and different, but I hope it’s not 3 albums of this.
7/10 too much water
I love the part where the band stopped playing and just had two dudes cry uncontrollably for 4 minutes
This is most Joey thing ever
We are living in a golden age.
I'm smoking a bong to this.
The person at 3:39 is entertained.
The video and accompanying music reminds me of the old Adam West Batman shows. I love it.
nice sound
MAGNIFICENT
What is even going on in this comment section 😂😂 I'm beyond confused but love it lmao
Getting early Zappa/Mothers vibes from this. Unrelated comparison: Fatboy Slim - Weapon of Choice, down undah
I think that's the single shortest functional ending I ever heard. The very first time I heard it, I stopped the stream, autonomously, at 10:02 out of 10:03. I've now done that twice since, just grooving and not anticipating or thinking about the ending, and then that bass flub is like Pavlov's bell, I swear. It's not even a flinch or rush - you're  just grooving along, there's the cue, and you casually reach over and press it... 10:02. The most ruthlessly efficient ending ever, to a killer groove.
Immaculate vibes in this music video
Gold
The fricken view of the sunlit Beach and this dude losin it on air guitar to this funk is just perfect
A bit Babe rainbow esque
DANGGG he pets a cat AND a dog in this video?!?! That's a 10/10 from me fam
Fuckin fantano comment section fr
I loved the fact when we go back to the start, because the music is awesome, it looks like we are rewinding a videotape!! These guys...
Australia your NUTS man but i  F*cking love it, hail from thee NOR OF THEEE WAY
The spirit of tony allen on this drum beat is insane <3
Jack Stratton collab when?
Wow… this AI is getting really good at randomly generating music. Almost sounds like the real thing
Hey boyz, Im lovin it! But one question I have.. The video was recorded in Italy or Greece, or maybe Croatia? Im not sure, but it seems adriatique to me..
🇬🇷
I feel like this guy and the dude from the black hot soup video would have gotten along well.
Music sucks right now
Keep ot up make it tighter swoon
joey hittin the 10 minute yoinky sploinky
What a KILLER instrumental. WOW.
This is all the vibes I could ask for.🌊🦎☀ See ya'll at Desert Daze.🤟
I can only like this once???? Crap site.
A masterpiece of sight & sound
that guy in the video is weird.
the best 2 min of the month I had so far! oh wait it was 10... repeat  no one here gets out alive
I like to imagine that in an alternate universe, Danger Five is called Ice V and this is their theme song.
Cool guy has a chill day
This video is no Rattlesnake, but I'll take it.
Joey is channeling all the energy of this masterpiece
Vibin': the music video
wonderful, boys
Un capo joey
In all seriousness, does this song sound like it has a bit of a Brazilian vibe to anyone else? For some reason I get the feeling they must have been listening to Os Mutantes and such.
Sounds like a 1970s VST sick as fuck
Amazing video for such a amazing song.
dance moves are epic
fantastic stuff as always, guys
Joey is srsly a transcendental dance ninja from an age of great style and report
I’m so glad they put prog rock on hold
Joey channeling his 80's Weird Al look.
Awesome!
Broccoli eating scene 5:00
Is that Weird Al?
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT MC RIDE TO DO THE FLUTE SOLO HOLY SHIT
Me acabo de levantar y me topo con esta canción, no hay mejor forma comenzar el día.
Not enough appreciation for the lyrics in the comments either!
Rubbish
Just a nice guy enjoying his holidays in Greece
Glad to see Joey and I are like-minded dancers.
Where in Greece is it shot?
💉💉💉 I know y'all had a ball making this video
4:17 - that's basically me listening to any KG&LW track...
So is this album gonna be Jupiter themed? With Ice V (5) and Ganymede? I hope we get a Jovian 1 and 2
Pretty certain that the video for S.A.D. by Kirin J Callinan inspired this video.. Go watch if you haven't seen it.
How the hell do you play the beat at min 6? Unless it's more than one drum track.
Sounds a bit like something Frank Zappa would write.
gettin some Kirin J Callinan vibes
Gizzard is a chicken liver and all livers are poison full of toxins! Shouldn't of ever served are ate zoo animal food!!
<3 didjeriLOVE kinggzrdndtlzrdwzrrrrr
Funkiiii
The Sun of God,the light of the world,the morning star, rising in the east, being seen through the clouds walking on water... The Sun of God is the reason for the seasons..
bold of them to film joey walking around for 10 minutes as all the music radiated from his body
Was honestly a little shocked by the 35 minute sex scene cold cut into the middle of the song but I will never question the Gizz 🫡 another certified banger Gentleman
Joey being best friends with his shadow is something I can relate to looool😂
Here is SOMETHING new https://youtu.be/u6nZJ3FcrHY
Shadow flirting!
The lead single for the upcoming Weird Al biopic is a banger!
10 minutes of Australian man trying to fit into small Turkish village life.
So, King Gizzard discovers the Mediterranean see, its places and Its people Welcome to you Wizard Lizard! Please consider touring Italy in the near future!
Joey dancing with his shadow is honestly one of the most mesmerizing things I've ever seen
https://youtu.be/5wbKsfIOylw🧨🎈🎊
Simply EPIC!
Best video ever made. and the tune is great. tame impala could never
Will we survive Ice 5? Will humanity survive the grand solar minimum???
Does anyone else feel this influenced by afrobeat? There is a point about half of the song when I start feeling Fela Kuti vibes
Vengan a tocar a Colombia por favor
what a lucky rock
Great track... Where the video was recorded?
Awesome song, Gizz low key putting out some funky bangers. Love it.
I've had this video on repeat for 2 hours now
"Will we survive?" Ugh that's so damn good. That piece of the lyrics plus experiencing this heatwave, chef's kiss.
After hearing how improved is now their instrumentation, I have no doubt they will be realeasing an orchesta album soon
I want the name of that kind of drugs which Joey have been used on this video! :D
this is amazing
This is so funky I love it
Franck Zappa would have been proud of you guys 😍
I hope these guys will come to Vienna again. Since i first heard them back in 2017, they quickly became one of my absolute favorite bands. I always dreamt of seeing them perform. I’m 19 now and this year it was about to finally happen! I bought an entirely red outfit and built a foam moped helmet to resemble their looks in fishing for fishies. (Real helmets aren’t allowed in concerts, you see). Then, two days before the concert in the Arena Wien, i received an email telling me about poor Stu’s situation. Of course I understood that they had to cancel the dates. I was worried more about Stu. I just hope that i will have the chance again to see them perform in a location not to far from where I’m living. (At least in a 200km radius) -But my friend and I were happy we still had tickets to see Wolfmother in Vienna. Oh yeah… And then the same thing happened with their concert…  That’s no rant btw. guys, as everyone knows, life can and eventually will give you lemons. I just wanted to share that with you, because now that i think about it, it seems kinda funny. Peace and love to both KGLW and WM ❤️
when he was dancing w his shadow that shi had me tripping it looked so beautiful like woahhh
Wow
Damn. I think Joey got me pregnant.
I like the part between the synth solo and the groovy breakdown
I'm on board for wherever Gizz wants to take us on this auditory journey. Let's go!
dont worry about the destination, just drive
Ice Fart is sick
This is how it feels to chew ice 5 gum
The best thing on the internet
Really speaks to the band's potency that this was all done in one take
When my family asks me what I'm doing with my life.
luar biasa
Useless info, folks: I'm using the YouTube API for knowing how much dislikes there's on videos. For now there's 8k likes and only 35 dislikes.. Now you're informed, bye 🤣
masterpiece
Huge
Another Genre concord! Hints of "Sergio Mendes and Brazil '66"!!!
Groove machine.
So cool Weird Al agreed to do this
Just feeling it
Giving Napoleon Dynamite a serious run for his money.
These dance moves reminds me so much of the video for "Johnny Says Stay Cool" by the Babe Rainbow. Is this foreshadowing a crossover?
0:57 Joey petting the kitty 🥺
ambrose on the sax oh my god he really can do it all
Fun fact: the video was made before the song
I need to know where he gets all his outfits.
Can someone please tell me where this was filmed? It's so goddamn beautiful 😍
If anyone asks me for music recommends I send them to the Gizz. Then they're like "what/who would you most compare them to?" And I'm like "yes"
This is my new favorite king gizzard music video. We love you Joey 😍💜🧡🐇
I DEMAND a 10 minute music video of every band member vibing. Maybe Cookie next?
I just gizzed my jorts
I've played this song about 50 times at work today. i made sure everyone saw the Air-Keyboard solo.
From the latest Gizzymail:  "All I could do was just keep rolling, watch and giggle as Joe danced his big, beautiful heart out”  Danny Cohen.  “This was a big one for me. I had to abandon my ego and dance in public for 12 hours in the scorching hot Greek sun. Let’s just hope that the bride and groom of the 100 person wedding I performed in front of felt like I didn’t steal too much of their limelight.”   Joey Walker
Best 10 minutes in my life
god i wish that were me
I love the mustache. Seems a mix of Giorgio Moroder with John Travolta.
THE GIZZVERSE IS ETERNAL 💠
Ive never blushed this hard in my life, thank you for this, exactly the right amount of arousement in this <3
10 minutes of pure visual and auditory GOLD.
Man. I hope they do this on KEPX in October. They are gonna have an insane set.
how do they keep coming up with so many amazing songs fucking legends
Ocean's 11 vibes
This video is me in my house every time I listen to Gizz!
🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️
I'll have what he's having
sick
joey moroder
Of all the trippy, exciting, beautiful and thought-provoking Gizzard videos, and as amazing as Jason Galea is, this has to be their best video clip to date
Somebody went on a date with lucy.
King Gizz's commitment to taking the piss knows no bounds. International travel just for a laff? Check.
I own every album on vinyl and bought the 3 new ones today too. I dont even listen to them, just to look at and have.
their output is so frequent that the quality should be bad but they legitimately havent released a bad project imo. these guys are keeping music alive its great to see and hear
So good.
GTA 6 maybe ? Vice city vibes...
C-C-C-Cocaine and 70's porn had a child, his name is Joey Walker. This is a silky groove of utmost awesomeness. Thanks Gizz!
Joey’s shadow play is just as inspiring as his light work
YES!
Ba-dass!
Joey giving off mad Zohan vibes on this one
Que música!!! eles não param nunca 🙌🙌🙌 te amo king gizzard
That groove maaan in it
Joey with the groovy moves 🕺🏻
Ice - V: Well known precursor to Ice IX, the type that may be encountered whilst surfing with the alien or playing Cat's Cradle...
looks like this was filmed on the Greek island Hydra
Love Joey going ham and vibing out for 10 mins straight! He got them crocs in sport mode, you know he ain't messing around.
Yea im not born yet to see this
Weird Al, Morodor, that firefighter that did the local cable community network art show for kids. [Commander Mark.] That whole guy w mustache in the 80s 70s throwback guy. That guy has a range... He's been everywhere for decades. Churchill described why fear is weird already. I hope Mr. Mustache keeps on dancing! <3
Joey's dance moves seem like an inspired fusion of Jack Stratton from Vulfpeck with splash of Napoleon Dynamite, and I genuinely mean that as a sincere form of flattery, I absolutely love this
So you into music at all? -hard cut to Joey head bopping on a Salad in Greece
Little did anyone realize...this is actually secret footage of Weird Al Yankovic on his trip to Portugal in 1983
So this is that Weird Al biopic I keep hearing about
Love the track! Joey is sending out huge Alexander Marcus vibes. If you know you know
this is your music video format now, make one just like this for every other song
see, now gizz knows what the ppl WANT
slay
slY
TE AMOOOO
TE AMO JOEY
SLAYYYYY
strongest candidate for sexiest man alive 2022
i need a cold shower
10 mins of joe having a lovely day to himself. Love it!
(When everyone thinks Erik ran off with the millions. But it was really you)
The fact they managed to get Daniel Radcliffe to appear in charicter as Weird Al Yankovic to star in this video is truly incredible.
Joey really rocking those stubbies
Is Joey fishing for fishies?
They just followed Joey during a normal day and discreetly film everything
#17 on trending in Canada!
call me by your name 2
amazing video
Longest 10 minutes of my life
Today I'm starring as Danny.
This is how all Americans should act when they travel to other countries, instead of self-righteous and always demanding things be upsized!
I'm catching unusually strong Hrithik Roshan vibes...
Porn stache, Crocs and long instrumentals. GIZZARD!!
Perfect Music Video!!
is this a vonnegut reference or what
This is the best Weird Al music video I've ever seen.
I love how they used all the shots from the Weird Al movie these guys just go the Fook off
Does anybody know where this was filmed?
Bro. THIS IS A VIBE.
I'm really glad to hear you playing jazz again
I was a bit hesitant when they brought out the dingo howling for 6 minutes while Amby kept yelling 'I am the shrimp doctor' but now I think it's the best part of the song.
chefs kiss*
made my day better hearing this
Cat's Cradle reference?
i’m totally getting stoned as i watch this
just pre-ordered the three new albums from the Gizzverse 😀
Joey could do a perfect joker tbh
I loved the ending shot
Hahahaha please tell me u have seen/heard Marechià from Nu Genea
Such a vibe! 🌞
progzeira de respeito
Joey is definitely a sex god . they were going to need to address the reality of that at some point. . . .but.  Seriously yall this is the best Beck cover I've ever heard. Gizz totally makes this track they're own. Brilliant
joey drippin in this one
I thought I was watching the 'Took Too Much' subreddit.
Ive been waiting on a band whos good enough to make a modern day Peaches En Regalia
Dude, Joey is the man.
Cosmo and Wanda
Did you know king gizzard and the lizard wizard is just one guy?
Holy smokes, it's Dickhead!
If I wasn't sure I was gay before, I definitely am now.
Definitely reminds me of the mysterious “Ice-Nine” from Kurt Vonnegut’s book, “Cat’s Cradle.”
Boys, I am getting STRONG Donny Benét vibes, and I'm here for it.
King Gizzard são o nosso Grateful Dead do século 21!
Where was this filmed?
I can't believe they got Weird Al to be in this video
¡como los amoooooooo hijos de la chingada!
Maybe it's not their best video, but this track is a combination of most of my favorite Gizz elements: groovy funk/fusion mixed with proggy psych and sci fi/fantasy themes. Grade A stuff. I hope the whole record is in this general direction.
I don’t even really want to like this band but they are so consistently good damn
Gizzboss slay moment
Strong 5/weak 6 for everything. Been an avalanche creatively of mediocrity for a while thoo
Joey having a napoleon dynamite dance scene
Ice V is pretty cool, not as cool as Ice Nine, so it goes
Gizzpeck (in a good way)
Pero qué maravilla es ésta??🤣🎉💜💜
¡Chulada! Sonidos envolventes cómo una ola onda musical. Gracias gracias gracias, bendiciones amorosas. ✨💖✨✌🏼🎶🌹🪶👌🏼🙏🏼🌼🌻🧑🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀💙❤️🧜🏼‍♂️🧜🏻‍♀️👻👻
This is soo so good
nice
They really got Joey blasted on acid and released him like a beast onto an unsuspecting public. Respect.
Not really sure what I watched … but I liked it
Loved it !
5:18 live your ''mythos'' in Greece
Fucking great song
Really looking forward to the three new albums. I recently binge-listened to all the prior albums in case they’d release anything.
Musically you guys are on solemn heights. I could only think of one band that comes close: Blind Melon. I hope to catch you guys on a European tour.
When Joey did some of Jason Galea’s acid, instant classic
Couldn’t help but be amazed by cookies 5 minute pasta recipe on top of the satar solo. Absolutely mind blowing
You guys JUST put out the Dripping Tap, you really didn't need to go this hard again so soon.
You guys couldn’t miss if you tried
is it porn music?
kings gambit + classic bishop sac. = prepare to eat s***  https://youtu.be/Q0SJBDn8t18
5:00 oh shit I just realized I am that guy in public...  often
Live your myth in Greece!
come to Chile
Yes! Funky Gizz! Makes so much sense!
Joey really doesn’t fear the Interior People anymore
Looking forward to see this featured at the Country Music Awards this year :)
I like the part in between the begaining and the end.
This is truly amazing, adding this to one of my favourite songs, and music videos ever made. Excellent work. My flowers have been handed to you guys.
Joke band
Could someone tell me where it has been filmed? I have a déjà vu feeling
The universe is now in equilibrium after the Gizzards blessed not only Turkey but also Greece!
My panties are soaked
Felt like the same Dance Coordinator as black hot soup but a song for Tom Sellick
Ice V sounds like an anime villain name.
Walky Jake at his best
Straight up 🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊
glad to see Joey rockin the 70´s pornstar look
Joey and that cat were so wholesome and cute
Damn, so much to say. Song was fuckin' LEGIT, that's gonna make a SICK jam. Really can't wait to blast this while I'm cooking next and LOSE IT dancing. I also just finished a book yesterday that made me desperate to visit Greece, and here we are consider that trip PLANNED.
Is this a lost episode of Magnum PI ?
hi
Loving the 10 minutes of unearthed Weird Al Yankovic footage they used on this
This just makes me happy. Simple as that.
I love this. Definitely one of my favourite gizz tracks of the past year
Its amazing how Joey is the only person in the band who could do this video maybe amby but i dont see Stu or the other guys dancing like this in front of people
This the King Gizz hip hop album teaser? Has the time come?!
Hi stu
I want microtonal music!!!!!!!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Joey as a sex icon, no one can look this good with socks, crocs and a pedo mustache
All of Joey's fits are killer
Can’t wait to see an audience having a huge dance-off during a live show.
Ice V = the 5th ice age Ice V = I survive
Perfect video for a perfect Song.
That man is living his best life and from now on I too will dance while I eat my broccoli!
Damn, crocs are the best dancing shoes apparently 😱
I didn't care for the farm animal sounds. That is until I listened to the song in reverse. Genius
Ah, Kurt V reference. Nice work lads
Such a great song. I've listened to it 5 times since its come out (about 5 hours ago)
Wasnt too sure about them sampling Wild Wild West by Will Smith for the 4 minutes at the end, but it's growing on me tbh
We jamming to phases of water tonight!
Lol at everyone making jokes but not addressing the serious message this video is sending. Thank you KG
HYDRA BAYBAAAAAYYYYYY
Greece 💙🤍
Joey embracing his inner Weird Al
King Gizz has a song generator or something. The Stu Machine 3000
me after hearing the new King gizz song
This was strangely cathartic... I really need to visit Greece one day.
The stanky leg is canon in the gizzverse
1972 called and Joey answered.  Hilarious, and great funky music.
Best video since Eat It!
an amazing and classic song as always
D a d d y 😍
🚨HOT DUDE ALERT 🚨
I ran into this man in June of this year at the Nashville Whole Foods and can confirm he does in fact exist.
This is seriously great!
Joeypoleon Dynamite!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Brilliant video and music, just love you guys :)
Tsssss muy cool & psyche  , me recuerda esta rola a Skinshape
fun fact: the music here isn't actually overdubbed, it was actually just radiating from joey wherever he went
A fine addition to my sex playlist
thank you lads
Joey showing off the lead guitarist fisique. Behold.
Great song
Your music makes me feel good.
Very happy to know that Weird Al's son is carrying on the musical tradition of his father. Bravo !
this is the most Grecian video you've done, b'ys.  great work as always
"10 minute workout at home... or the beach! This killer dance workout will torch calories FAST!"
I want to say what is ice V? But isn't Ganymede one of Jupiter's moons? Or was it saturn?... Oh wait. Yeah. It's one of Jupiter's moons...
this made my wednesday slightly better.
HOW DID YOU GET A COPY OF MY VACATION VIDEO
I don't know why but this is my jam. Reminds me of Quarters which is one of my fav albums by far. Great vocal melodies btw.
Sounds like there are some parts of magenta mountain hidden in it. Cant wait for the 3 new releases <3
I love everything about this
Those sunset shots near the end are dope
SO JAMMY, LOVE IT
These guys sound like @BisselBluesCompany.
Jazz funk
Huhh...crazy Gizzheads....three Records in October.....get the funk now ☮️
For those who are wandering, the video was shot on location in Ydra Island, Greece. This is the island where Lenny Cohen had a house since the late 60's and where David Gilmour shot a video for one of his latest songs. Video shoot pobably took 2 days time (as you can see the sea is a little choppy in some shots and really tranquil in others). What makes this somehow even more epic is the fact that Joey and crew had to walk to all the locations as no cars are allowed in Ydra.
I suddenly have an urge to purchase a pair of crocs
look at that baby kangaroo go!!

Joey is my favourite lizard Wizard💙
70s porn star on his day off
i though they were on vacation but now i get it.
Son la mejor banda que existe en el universo 💜
Esto me hace recordar al chavo del 8 en Acapulco
WOW!!! That was awesome. I want to party with Joey. I love this song.
I read the comments before I listened to the Song, and have to admit got quite confused. Then I remembered that its the Gizz community lol
I like how Gizzverse says in the album details that each of these 7 songs were built around the 7 Greek modes (I’m guessing this one is Dorian maybe?), and conveniently they shot this video in… 🇬🇷
PURE ENDORFINE
This is remarkable! The fact they manage to record bowel movements and make them sound great makes me think of them as the Manhattan project of music.
nice vibe ice five
Joey the best 70s detective on his summer vacation living his best life love it
My grandma heard this song 50 years ago. Get some new content bozo
The only thing better than the song are these comments, I’m pissing myself😂
I think this video needs justa little bit more of body hair to reach otherwordly perfection
definitely has "Cool Guy Has Chill Day" vibes
Blaxploitation Gizz for this one then :)
The lads made us groove with another banger
I didn't give my permission to video of me dancing! That is absolutely me in my kitchen litening to Gizz and the Wiz
Not sold, but I think that's fair 'cause surely Christian Death Metal isn't everyone's cup of tea.
Guys please make another metal album I am begging you
I cannot wait to see this live!
I cannot believe that gizzard decided to deliver a 5 hour lecture on mesozoic mammal paleontology to start this album...what an insane band
This is uncle Rico’s deleted dance scene from Napoleon Dynamite
Yall literally asked Joey to be joey for an entire morning and said "yup, this is the music video".
Good to see Joey's enjoying his vacation
Wow I can’t believe they got Weird Al for this video
🥵
So I guess every song on this album is centered around one of the seven Greek modes.  Cool.
I really hope these guys realize how lucky the are
Headcanon : Joey is John Travolta's secret son
So glad the woodwinds are making an appearance again.
Please take Donny Beńet on tour with you.
You may not like it, but this is what peak happiness looks like.
Love the waka waka grooviness of the song! Hell yeah Gizz!!
Walky Jake is the best member of the band 👍🏻
If Joey didn’t need to be playing an instrument I’d hope he’d just be on stage grooving to this live! Big dance party
This is so cool!
Joey, Marry me!!
❤️ son lo mejor Los mollejos
this is insanely good. and then there's the music in the background, that is also really good
can this band ever make a bad tune? ...answer... a solid NO
Cinnabon Gene on his summer vacation
Fear is a freezing gulf that flows like lava through the Mariana Trench into your bed blossoming into a nightmare pinned under the weight of Ganymede. Fear is a serpent that screams in your ear forever saying "You're next... At the Abattoir."
I’m not listening to this until all three albums are out but boy am I hyped for this
Do they go “whooo!” In every song?
I love everything about this
ten minutes of joey dancing wasn't enough. release the cut footage, you cowards!
FEAR      IS A FREEZING GULF      THAT FLOWS LIKE LAVA      THROUGH THE MARIANA TRENCH      INTO YOUR BED      BLOSSOMING INTO A NIGHTMARE      PINNED UNDER THE WEIGHT      OF GANYMEDE      FEAR IS A SERPENT      THAT SCREAMS      IN YOUR EAR FOREVER      SAYING      "YOU'RE NEXT...      ...AT THE ABATTOIR"
Joey is channeling his inner Donny Benet.
This might be one of the Gizz songs of all time!
great song as always <3
This track puts the broadway musical STOMP to shame. The way they incorporated syncopated broom sweeps over individually smashing light bulbs is so genius.
Dude, this is great. I’ve had an amazing day and this topped it off, love u gizz
Amazing!
joey is so swag
Thank you. We all needed a whole video of just Joey looking like a dancing snack.
♥️
Lets goooo!!!
I knew Joe was a sex symbol from day 1
saw comments about 10 minutes of silence or something like that? i was not disappointed
Every time his outfit changed I thought, "there's no way Joey can top that one" and I was wrong every time.
This could've been a forgotten jam off Hot Rats. Sick work boys.
absolute vibes, these chaps never fail to disappoint!!!
JOEY = OSCAR
You're telling me a V iced this Five?
8:17 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Alternative title: Joe does a Greece
The R Kelly cameo was risky... But well executed
Someone has been reading Vonnegut 👍
This World does not deserve the awesomeness of Joey's moves.
Oh that’s how you dance to rock
Yes!!!!!! That was awesome! Just pre-ordered the 3 new albums, I love you guys ❤ 💙 💜
Huge "Trapdoor" vibes and that's good, I LOVE that era of KGLW
🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷 ΚΟΥΛΗ ΣΕ ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ ΠΟΥ ΕΦΕΡΕΣ ΤΟΥΣ ΚΙΝΓΚ ΓΚΙΖΑΡΝΤ ΣΤΗΝ ΕΛΛΑΔΑ 🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
The Weird Al Movie is looking unreal!
grooved holes right through them crocs, no doubt
I wonder if the title is a reference to ice nine from vonneguts cats cradle (I think)
totally he is enjoy his moment and loving his self 💯
Joey is all of us watching a new KGLW vid
I guess that's why the call him Walker
how does this fit into the gizzverse
I thought it was Weird Al the entire time.
Fear is a freezing gulf that flows like lava through the Marina trench into your bed, blossoming into a nightmare pinned under the weight of Ganymede.   Fear is a serpent that screams in your ear forever, saying “You’re next at the abattoir.”
This is gonna be INSANE live
A reggaetón interlude with the band members twerking on each other will take some getting used to but I admire the boldness
Love it! Can't wait for the rest of the albums! 😎
And i was wondering what the hell they were doing hanging out in Greece for so long . Now the puzzle is complete !
vacation goals
We are Joey. We live every moment of our lives dancing like this to their music.
Okay guys, we only have 1$ for our new video.  Joey: I got this.
How the fuck do you guys keep doing it?
This new Weird Al Yankovik biopic looks really neat.
👍
He should've played Weird Al in the movie coming out
I love this direction, this song really grabbed me.
It's so awesome that you guys could cast Weird Al Yankovic for this video! Crazy!
We gizzfans are truly blessed
Wasn’t expecting Gizz to cover all Nickleback songs all at once but it’s fucking good
Clearly Daniel Radcliffe was the wrong casting for the weird al movie
he just like me frfr
This video makes me miss the good old days when you could find decent nose candy.
This is just premium joey content
joey the real heart of the band
This music video accurately portrays what’s it like to be in public while listening to king gizzard with your AirPods in
Funky as hell and I love the video- truly sounds like King Gizzard have reached their ultimate final form
what is this Austrobeat?
Woooo
Joey LOL
Walky Jake!
THEY NEVER MISS
They even Gizz on vacation 💪 Stunning clips with a beautiful message. Joey kills it!
Dude like  Weird Al Yankovic ..rockin'  "la dolce vita" in Greece!😁🍻
I love this
Mi novio
Joey obviously studied and trained prior to performing this video. In one performance he’s captured the savoir faire and athletic grace of Gene Kelly, the catlike moves and uninhibited sexuality of Rudolph Nureyev, the pure expression of the human condition of Donald McKayle and the pure f*ck all intensity of my 1960’s acid casualty Uncle Fred…. Bravo! Bravo my good man! 👏
I was listening to this in the car with my 12 year old and at the end I was like "They always do that, the end of the song sounds like they're starting the next song" and she goes "that's cool!"
This whole video just Joey dancing?
70s pornstar Joey is the best Joey era
Brilliant to use David Lee Roth for the spoken word part. when he says flamboyance is a riot fire of an insecure ego it hits hard. Then a Steve Vai solo? Gizzsane, as Snoop says.
Joey Walker as Adam Sandler
Ahh  a david bowie cover, nice touch!
My favorite part was when Joey
This video perfectly encapsulates the grooving I have to resist to break into when I'm listening to Gizz in public.
My favorite part is when Joey descends into madness while dancing on an island to a 10 min gizz jam
Can this replace the Napoleon Dynamite dance routine? I believe it has!
joey is so sexy damn
Joey is the Sexiest Man Alive!
well apparently I'm gay for Joey
Having fun are we?
I really love the shakey cinematography on those freestyle dance scenes. Really gives it a tasteful found footage vibe
this is such a Joey classic 🔥
This is a masterpiece, I fucking love this
This is too sureal. Its just giz being in places that ive been to its insane.
I love that every single time I see Joey, he somehow manages to look even more bogan than he did before.
They played some parts of this amazing song on their Zihuatanejo DJ set
Rumor has it that Joey didn’t even know they were recording a music video
Very 70s
I like how Joey (played by Joe Walker) just goes insane right in the middle of the video.
man that Joey Guitar guy is sexy
On first go I'm loving this. The Ice V refrain itself is awesome I kinda wish it had appeared more throughout the song.
Fuckin Aye Joey,  goofball
A new gizz song already? Alright!
Whoo!
At first I wondered if we really needed five sequels to ice, but turns out I had no reason to worry
Where was this filmed?
Wild that they got a Collab with Bill Clinton on this one, but it's totally worth!
I'm sad I missed your concert this year in Greece.  :( I hope I manage next time! Gizzard for life!
Hey! Great video, great song! Thanks for blocking it in my country!
This is really good. I zoned in and released, i kind of forgot I was listening to this while listening to this.
Is this song about Joey's Flying V that lost the head, but now is laying safely in cryogenic chamber?
Who else got chills when he said “I’m King of the Gizzards, and this is a Wizard that’s also a lizard” and then played a mean triangle solo?
at first i didnt really understand the decision to include Borat in the music video, but now im totally into it
another incredible song
This music video is perfect in how it showcases joey just living the best life he can without the fear of how others look at him not frozen under the weight of social norms dancing in a bright outfits through the port town.  This will truly be on my top 5 gizz albums of 2022
Something to watch when your mood is down!
Woooooow, this was sooo good! Now I'm extremely stoked for all the new albums! Also, Joey is an absolute hunk and I just want to play with his curls at the beach all day.
Weird Al looking pretty fuckable here.
Literally me on LSD :
Jazzy, jammy, funky goodness. Reminds me of quarters and altin gun in all the best possible ways
yo do you guys like Kurt Vonnegut?
many many kisses from greece <3
Damn, the Weird Al movie is looking sick as hell!
Big napolean dynamite vibes
You guys even got Weird Al to dance for your video. Amazing.
Wow! I never thought a 10 minute song of incompressible screaming from the boys could sound so good! This is why I love this band so much!
Fuuucking great, I didn't think you would include a charango solo mid-song. Still great tho.   Joey looks like an 80's chulo jaja
WOOOO 3 ABLUMS
GroOoOoOovy
It seems Santorini island greece...
I'm vibing hard to this.
King gizzt
now THIS is the female gaze
Not many people know that Afrobeat actually originated in Heidelberg.
It’s got some budos band/heist movie vibes, I’m diggin it.
Great song Great clip Joey is the king of air synth, dance with your shadow, dance with a bird watching you, sunset dancing, fashion style/coolness
Yawwwnnn , not my cup of Gizzard but the video is entertaining. Sound a bit like Jamiroquai
The air keys around 4:30 is the best part
How much footage did you have to get for a 10 minutes dance session?!!? Lmao
55 MORE DAYS TILL I SEE YOU GUYS AT THE CRITERION!!!
Unsure if I'm watching a Thundercat music video or an extended trailer for the new Weird Al movie
This song is about the untethered sound returning to the realm of life, unhinged happenstance leading to the party with-in.  Letting go of the common structural foundations of reality therefore opening that path to firmly cement the power and gain of certain vibrations.  Truly reflecting on the current state and status quo given to man by gravitational understanding.  Quite ingenious if you ask me.  Bravo 👏
mmm, it’s so funkadelic~  Joey has all the lavish yet effortless machismo of a 70’s beachside bachelor 💙
KIK IT JOEYYYYYYY..!!
He’s slowly morphing into Weird Al Yankovic.
That Joey sure is walkin
It’s crazy that Joey didn’t even know he was being filmed, this is just an average day for him
Probably the funniest video of King gizzard till now
I counted approximately 91 ice V's
I've never seen any man with as much inherent swag as Joey has in this video
I now suddenly want to go to Greece in the 70s lol
Fucking ear heaven!!!
Random YouTube recommendation I don't regret clicking on. Song was a banger
Sons of Fela Kuti 💚
Joey just gizzed on us hard!
This is fucking incredible
im attracted to him
Missed opportunity not casting Joey as Weird Al in the upcoming biopic!
Do I need to watch the first 4 to understand the plot?
This new weird Al song isn’t funny.
Did Joey just do that stanky leg?!
the choreography, the costume changes, the Joey! And the Greece, golden.
Possibly the best tin whistle solo I've ever heard.
does somebody know what island this is?
Joey has become Napoleon Dynamite! Incredible song, a new favourite, just an awesome jam
joey fans have truly won
The visual completely distracted my audio experience… I’ll need to listen again properly!
Joey's interpretive dance music debut!💃💃💃😎😎😎
Beautiful choreography - I've never seen anyone dance with a giant rock like this 😍
Couldn't help but smile throughout the entire video, I fucking love this band!
We love you King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.
Joey Walker does a really good job playing Joey in this video, wow!
Ice V vs. John L
Which Greek island?
Nice to see napoleon dynamite found work again
Yo también bailaría así si estuviera en Grecia. Esto es excelente, gracias por existir!
I dropped my dacks and rubbed out a burning ghost
This just popped up in my recommendations and i can honestly say, it's the best recommendation i've recieved from youtube in Ages. Been to Mykonos and walked the same path as this dude by the windmills, so the video brings forth a sense of nostalgia too
Oh my god slow down I’m still processing omnium gatherum
I hope Joey didn't get a melanoma
crocs smh
I now know the story of the video. Basically Joey got left behind in leg of the tour in Greece. Did too much acid and then just dances around the beaches of Greece.
This video is very similar to convenience store's video for FAN DEATH
What a Vibe, sometime you just gotta dance like when your grandaddy was 20.
KingGizz's tribute to Kirin J. Callinan's S.A.D. videoclip?
Long how I have waited for the Gizz Steely Dan Record
I fucking love this band
WOOOOOOOOOO
honestly so amazing!
shout out to paradise on earth Hydra, Greece!
When Joey started playing with the cat he immediately entered my personal list of "literally me" people
So when are King Giz and Client Liaison doing a collab?
Please add a NSFW tag, how can I explain this to my boss?
Hey mum? It's me. Guess what. The '70s exploitation film Italian composer Gizz era just dropped.
LESS GO THAT SHIT'S AMAZING
how are there comments from like 18 hours ago this came out 30 minutes ago
🤍
The fact all the jokes about the weird genres and instruments doesnt sound implausible is a testament to the bands versatility
Joey is now my spirit animal
Greece didn't get to see Cavs play but at least they got to see Joey boogie in little green shorts  🩳
I've been in a foul mood all morning, just as I think the afternoon is going to be more of the same on comes the Gizz with one of their shorter tunes to put a smile on my face... Hopefully, there will be an extended version on the album.
You need to repeat the song 4 times to get the full album
Stupid sexy Joey!
Waitaminute is this a Weird Al Yankovich video???????
How'd you spend your vacation in Greece? I danced for 6 days straight.
Great stuff can’t wait for the full album
this is exactly how i behave in public while i’ve got y’all in my headphones and i’m wandering around. finally — a music video about ME being a DOOF everywhere!
<3
They play both types of music, country and western but the pan pipe solo really blew my socks off.
Wow, did not anticipate the 5 minute drum solo played on recycled plastic milk bottles. King Gizz continues to break musical ground.
wow! i didn’t think they could pull off doing a vocal chop from a sample of the first ever mcdonald’s commercial released in 1963, but they did it!
the comments are concerning me a lot, just want to say hear about you from melbourne radio, they like you down here!
TAKE ALL MY MONEY FOR CHRIST SAKE
Joey Dreamboat
The vaseline budget for both the lens and Joey must be through the roof
This is what happens after the party when you get lost on your walk home
Vulfmon's Australian counterpart has been located
Joey Walker's Odyssey
Joey is in his daddy era
Thats the best cover of the british anthem ive never seen
me when I saw that this was a 10min long song: yes
I appreciate everyone's creativity, but just need to say how much I love the amount of fun Joey obviously had making this! Epic!
Loving ittttttt
as a joey girl this could not get any better
I have never heard your music before but I am absolutely mesmerized
❤❤❤
Joe's dancing, and this entire video, reminds me of something that Vulf would produce
That cat had two arseholes.
I typically wouldn’t question Gizz’s artistic choices, but I’m not sure how appealing ten minutes of uninterrupted silence is going to be for an album. I’m sure it’ll be an acquired taste though
Earth is a friendly place  long live this great music
Nice 5
These are definately some sounds. Cheers!
I can't believe that they managed to get Daft Punk to reunite! The gizz boys never fail to amaze me
Some say Joey Walker had to actually become a madman to film this masterpiece. What a legend.
22 mins ago? Oh yea!
Greek Joey giving massive Narcissus vibe by kissing his own shadow @ 06:31 😂  Love the song, strong lyrics, we are all gonna burn, the end is near, can't wait for the album <3
JOEY IS CONFIRMED HOT DADDY
Classic only from king gizzard well done guys 👏👏 love the dance off with the shadow 😂
Joey is so chaotic. Somehow even the way he pets a dog is surprising
joey kul boi
Eeeeeeyup
Thank you, its glorious!
I didn't expect to enjoy the 5 minute slide whistle solo, but it was honestly the highlight of the track
ROLONONNNN, se viene Quarters 2? Ojalá 🙏
So excited for gizztober!
Can't believe this song is a direct sequel to Vegimite, so cool how it seamlessly bridges it into both butterfly 3000 and infest the rats nest
this is dope as always
Infest the rats' nest continues!
La mejor banda del mundo 💥
earring in right ear? <3
Instant classic
I never thought a Tiny Tim cover album could sound so good.
What going on in the comments?!
you never fail, how is this even possible  love u!!!
hey can the vhs bootleg guy make this a vhs rip please!!!!! find them! pay them!
Great song, had so much fun in the chat with you guys!
Already waiting for Ice VI
I can't even begin to describe how happy I am that you guys shot this music video in my country
After how long should you call a Dr after an erection again?
Quarters 2 for sure
Hecccctic
Joey looks like Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop in this Clip... He's even got the movezzzz.......
I was having a shit morning, but not anymore. Impossible to be in a bad mood now. Love it.
Some V compound boys <3
Cavs is on 🔥🔥🔥
so true besties
yes
best 10 minutes of my life
Crete?
This tune is incredible. When are the 3 albums up for pre order in the U.K.?
I need some ice after seeing Joey's moves🥵
Wow boys what a great song! Now where’s the other announcements?
This is too good, happy to have been at the premiere
instant king gizzard classic
gonna be Quarters 2?
Soundtrack for the next Tarantino movie
Feelin’ Fela Fellas 👏👏👏
Te amo Stu
this one made me puke! great work as always guys ♥
Joey got the moves
Joey dancing at the beach on acid for 10 mins niceeeeee
A regular day in the life of Joey
If Frank Zappa did crack
Truly captivating visuals
I like the part where he says I SPY
ICE V is FIRE
this is the greatest gizz tune to making breakfast
🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊
Banger
10 min song, another quarters album?!?
Good shite
this entire video is just joey being a complete 5 year old at the beach and i love it.  that being said this song has no business being this groovy.
joey is hot now :O
Is this gonna be... Quarters 2??? <3
ice fiveeeee ICE FIVE
What a jam!!!
Quintessential Joey.
AMAZING
Masterclass
Where’s the preorders at dont see them
Joey actually insisted they use all 36 hours of him dancing. They had to write the song around that
🕺
You're looking at a man in his prime.
valio cada segundo la pena levantarme a las 6 de la mañana pa ver esto. grande kingizz sigan asi👍🦎🧙‍♂️
Ice boogie
cool!!
lo amo demasiado 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 qué cosa tan groovy aaaaaaaa
Joey meets The Rock
This fucking made my day! So freaking awesome!
why he looks like Begbie from Trainspotting
So this is what all the people tweaking on the beach are doing
feel like dj shadow has a finger on it like my own reality
Sentí que vi una película mexicana en Acapulco
Jam phase confirmed
what a STAR
Finally 70s porn music!!
This is peak gizz
Joey is a natural movie star!!!!! Love this guys!!!
Man, they really did enjoy their time in Greece…
Gizz’s Grateful Dead era includes 70’s porn-funk, hell yeah dude
I love the extended version of Presumptuous
Cocaine Gizzard
Good morning everyone
KING GIZZRD
Im very aroused.
finally something good
Wooooooooooo
This is insane, I didn’t know that 2 hours of lead pipes clattering on the ground could be so groundbreaking. Only the gizz could do this
aw man i have to leave for work like right now
Who needs coffee when you have new King Gizzard music to listen to when you wake up? 😆
WOOOOO
very cool
BRRRRRRRRR
Loved the gizzyflute!
2 minutes until premiere!
Please tell me there’s heavy flute on the track!
I WAS HERE
Stu make your CD fans happy! Please release the 2022 products on CD. They're too good not to have bespoke products! Less stuff going to landfill with proper products rather than ripped discs. Please! These albums are amazing, let's let everyone listen to them!
Today is gonna be amazing! Just watched the sun come up waiting for this beauty to release.
Kind of an odd choice to feature Vanilla Ice, Ice T, and a legitimate soft-serve vanilla ice cream cone in one song, but who I am to judge the genius that is King Gizzard?
I can’t believe anything these fools saying in the comments lmao shits not even out yet haha
still cant get over the fact you guys made a country rap album
This is, by far, the hottest take on Bulgarian folk music I’ve ever heard.
disco is reeeeeeealy coming back huh?
Hi Madi I love you!! ♥️♥️♥️💝
This is definitely gonna be in the top 10 of the country music charts, my favorite part of the song was the björk and snoop dog feature during the sitar solo. The Tupac hologram was the cherry on top! I am amazed how they can keep innovating on each album.
vegemite

Lyrics:  Ice V, Ice V My favorite Ice Cream Ice V, Ice V VEGEMITE ICE CREAM (WOOOOOO)  [Joey's Digeridoo solo]  I woke up hungry, the ice cream is mine don't have any money for the sweet vegemite knock out the beggar and steal his change WAKE UP IT'S GIZZARD TIME!!

can you make a song about Murdering your fans please
The comments ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I thought Patrick Star could play a mean belly, that was until I heard Cavs relentlessly slap his for that 10 minute solo. It's amazing how he tuned his own stomach to microtonal tuning. Truly outstanding work, boys.
These Caribbean vibes with the steel drums and flute are tight! Can’t wait to hear the rest of the album!!!
Exciting!
Guys! I really didn’t think a Post Malone cover album would suit you fellas but you’ve outdone yourselves. This is shit hot!
Didn’t really expect a full album covering Weezer’s top 10 hits but color me surprised! Gizz can’t do no wrong!
This is clearly a note-for-note ripoff of Murray Head's "One Night in Bangkok"
When Stu starts doing the flute solo during the beat drop, its really one of the Gizz moments ever.
But where is Ice IV
so happy knowing han-tyumi is still alive
I like the part where the band chants about shitting and farding for five minutes straight tres avant-garde
блин, ещё 7 часов ждать 🙄 судя по лириксам, это будет стоунер метал
I love how you used essential oils as instruments, very clever, first time I've ever smelt music!
I liked the part when they sang and played instruments. Definetly a brave statement that shows the truth about society right now.
This gon be goood
Bold of them to start the song with 14 hours of complete silence, but that’s what makes this band so great
bro you guys going wild on the three part theremin chorus into a 6 minute otomatone solo, truely keeps the kpop theme of this album 🤘🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never expected a tambourine and kazoo ska fusion cover of the Barney theme song but man they really pulled it off in true Gizz fashion
these guys never fail to surprise me. Amby rapping through a 20 minute recorder solo? incredible. only gizz <3
Love how they actually ised an icemaker for the bass
Bro how do these guys make accordions sound so good?
alright ROBOT STOP, collaborate and LISTEN, the GIZZ are BACK with a brand new INVENTION, SOMETHING was holding JOEY TIGHTLY, they are releasing THREE ALBUMS, and the first song's abit ICY.... will they ever stop? YO, I don't know, they now have 23 albums, I think they good BRO....TO THE EXTREME they rock RED ROCKS like a VANDAL, when HEAD-ON comes ON everybody raises a CANDLE...
Crazy how they played instruments on this one! The boys never run out of ideas!
Finally a KG reggaeton album!
How do they have the budget to afford Michael Jordan to cosplay Michael Jackson? That was ice to the fifth
These comments are killing me 🐊
Nice to finally see a King Yeezy mashup. Peak performance
Joey killed the mri machine solo!!!
6:00am en México 🐊
Hmmm. Yodeling. That's new for gizz.
Man, that 30 minute bass solo with the incessant screaming in the background actually goes pretty hard.
Ambrose’s aboriginal yodeling solo was truly a highlight on this track, but I feel the pitched down screams of the damned really added to the fullness and depth of sound… another instant classic 👌🏼
Is it a planet, a moon, the 5th state of water?
Wow, the moment the Perihelion riff was played on the didgeridoo was outstanding, and finally we get the arc that connects “Hell” back to “Vegemite”.
wowwww with a name like ice v i didnt see it being the the title track of eyes like the sky 2!
Man, I like the melody, but why did Stu have to use so much autotune :/ the vocals really put me off.
This is definitely music
I loved the part where they revealed Eric is coming back to the band!
I was expecting many things, but Catholic Psychedelic Synth Folk wasn’t one of them.
Good use of the fire alarm noise as an instrument.
Looking at the lyrics and title it seems like a metal-ish song from them but you never know. They made my tomorrow by posting this;)
A Christmas album??????
Insane you guys managed to get dianna ross on the cello for this one. Proud of you boys x
STUPID SAXY AMBY
LET ME INNNNNNN
I have to admit this comment section is the best one I have ever seen, and the song isn't even out
Oh boy 17 hours to go
Reminds me of springtime in the outer rim
loved the part where stu busted out the theremin and then ambrose started twerking. best song yet guys!
wow! it amazing how you mix mexican music with jazz from Ukraine, it is blowminding
Dude I did not expect the part sampling the Arabic Motorola ringtone to slap so hard
Truly staggering how you guys managed to include 2 bagpipe solos in the middle of this industrial reggae song, really clever way of keeping the Scottish theme of the new album.
Los amo, ok?
Banger
A song comprised entirely of sound bits from ice type Pokémon… brilliant
3:18 with cook and joey is so GD GEEEEEEEWD
The collaboration with Yoko Ono was a bold move, but you guys really incorporated her talents well!
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.
Was Ice cube confirmed?
Betty White would be proud way to honor her legacy 👏
Cant believe they got mike ehrmantraut for this vid.
already know that the song is a banger
"I don't know about this new track guys.  I just think the band has changed, I guess I just prefer there old stuff before they got popular " 🙃🤣🤣🤣 Cheers gizz fans.  Be back soon !
wow i really didn't expect the announcement of a bluegrass country album! can't wait to hear that banjo plucking like a madman haha!
I Jizz 4 the Gizz
A collab with Tupac and The ensemble chorus from Dr. Zhivago. I never expected that!
this was for sure the king gizz song of all time
All I need are a couple woooos and at least one eyuup.
I’m so ready to gizz out with all my friends to king gizzard
Currently here and ready.
I would have never guessed King Gizzard could pull off the illest Peruvian cumbia out there but at this point i'm not surprised at all
givvard the lizard plissard
I know this is gonna be another banger
I can’t say I’ve ever heard a band sample audio recordings from Siberian internment camps in a song, kudos to y’all for the creativity! 🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊
They said it couldn't be done but Joey's use of a kazoo was some top tier shit!
The new Karate Kid movie looks insane
Para quien no lo sepa, el sample de sintetizador es una grabación de una tormenta en júpiter, solo que con modificaciones en el tono. La voz del final es de Ricardo Moyano, una pequeña referencia al microtonal.
If Joey is listening, make more bullant you bitch
When Stu said "Ice Five"... I felt that
Manijeando andoooo ❤
Wow didnt expect king glizzard to start flexing their iced out watches and jewelry
OK but wheres Ice I, Ice II, Ice III and Ice IV?
I’m pooping right now, in 22 hours I will likely be pooping to new king giz.
this is gonna be so metal
Damn that Ice T verse goes hard, fits just right with the Ice V
This is the best techno song of all time
Yo Cavs have to watch out. That drum solo from Eric was some of the finest shit ever!
It's Gizzmas, babey
yo this king gizzard amish rap song is great
wow. I can't believe you were able to get Milli Vanilli to come out of hiatus to do some spoken word poetry in a completely made up language. Not sure how the Lynard Skynard sample was supposed to fit in but I'm sure it will grow over time.
Time to gizz, gang
It truly is gizzard time
Hello fellow Redditors
WHAT'S HAPPENING
This is going to be a song I can lay some pipe to I can feel it
Damn stu those metal screams are dope, didn't know you guys were doing hardcore
i loved the part after the 5 minute epic instrumental when they switched to only using samples of Vanilla Ice. truly a gizz moment
Cow goes moo gizz goes woo!
Welcome to the altered future  This song is good
Even in space they got spaceships
The switch to Cambodian pysch-funk here was surprising but not totally unexpected
Can't wait for this new cobra kai episode
cant wait
I’M GIZZING EVERYWHERE
This will be one of the King Gizzard songs for sure.
The experimental cow bell. Just amazing!
I love it when he said "It's Gizzard time!" and then gizzed all over the place.
"everybody was kung fu fighting"
France is watching you 👀
This is the king gizzard and the lizard wizard song
Was not expecting a dubstep track from you guys but it sounds amazing
Long reign King Gizzard
what is in between Ice V and Predator X?
Gaming
This is the best Gizz song ever! -- Me in the future, probably
Gizzard
This will be the best king gizzard song ever  Remember me
IM PUMPED AS FUCK
