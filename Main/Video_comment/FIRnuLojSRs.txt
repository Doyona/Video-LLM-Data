15:44 wtf flew across the screen
13:47 he threw the ball up to celebrate and then just decided to catch it again
Nice catch Friermuth
GO THE VIKINGS BOO STEELERS;
If freiermuth caught that td on the last play this game would have been remembered forever now I barely remember this game happened
I was in that game
Now claypool gone 😹😹😹
1st time i've been to this stadium as a Vikings fan. It was a fun experience!
Where is Jefferson?
I’m glad Terrell Edmunds is gone
I love viking😊 I hate Steelers Almost comback🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
No matter how many games the Vikings win or squeeze through they will always blow it in post season play, remember what they call the Minneapolis miracle?, well they should have never won that game cause it gave them hope,hope the Eagles don't beat us too bad, that could happen again
If this gsme went into overtime it would've been crazy
leave it to the Vikings to almost blow a 29-point lead.
Kobe
Wow How long was the Steeler Defense on the field..
God bless every single one of you
That first half was pure heaven for Dalvin Cook owners in FF
When the line played well and Ben was calling the plays the offense ran very well. Shame Ben went out the way he did but at the end of the day that's football.
Vikings looking hot a big win
Losing Joe Buck is a huge win for FOX.
It was impressive how the Steelers came back but it’s sorta like seriously guys you can’t get into a 29 point deficit and expect to still win. Unless you’re Tom Brady
8:44 The minute I saw that, I expect Pittsburgh to try and make a comeback, and I was so right
Harrison Smith is Jason Bourne.
BRUH EVERYONE(STEELER FANS AND VIKING FANS) WAS ON EDGE NEAR THE END       Edit: put on a more serious note Dalvin cook EXPLODED OUT THERE( as did the rest of the vikes)        Put on a much much more serious note, I mean at least the Steelers got out from An almost blowout.    I’m a Vikings fan but I do feel bad for the Steelers at least during that moment. Imagine being down by almost 30 points and then having an almost comeback.      Hey at least you tried Steeler fans. From being down almost 30 points to being down just buy a touchdown, I think you guys haven’t to make it to the Super Bowl even if it’s not that year.    Kudos to Claypool tho for that very late celebration tho 😂, because of him we won that game just barely   Skol🙌🏻🙏🏻
Najee Harris 20 attempts 94 rushing yards 1 rushing touchdown  3 targets 3 receptions 10 receiving yards 1 receiving touchdown 22.4 Fantasy Points!
U would expect the team who had just beat the ravens the week before this game, to beat the team who just lost to the lions the weekend before this game🤣
I was at this game, just watched the highlights for the first time. My heart is racing & I knew the outcome lmaooo
Vikings are my favorite football team
I thought the  Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers
Cook ran that entire night basically
Still can’t believe a 29 point lead still almost wasn’t almost enough for the Vikings. Was a good game but it was so close to not working out… again… lol.
9:42 were they unaware that they were down 22 points?
Did anyone else not know that Chris Herndon was a Viking?
Que BUEN JUEVES NFL
I was at this game, Lol. I sat in the nosebleed seats. I think I helped some guy sitting next to me win some money in Fantasy Football.
Rg#52 offensive lineman Mason Cole  for the Vikings did a great job and now he is a Steeler!!!
atleast vikins won
Sad Steelers fan back to watch again
Steelers did great
the vikings kicker is getting traded
God bless you guys Always keep God first
Freiermuth gotta catch that dime.
the Vikings flew off well .they could have lost
I don’t even blame Roth that much. That o line did diddly squat. They couldn’t protect him at all.
this game was stupid crazy
That "Vikings Win It" brought back January 14th 2018 memories. Saints vs Vikings where the Minneapolis Miracle happened
I know Ben has mobility problems but I feel bad that he is stuck with a rebuilt, mostly young and inexperienced o-line that is struggling big time during his final season. Almost another comeback by Ben in his last season
I just want to say that I’m thankful for the Vikings offense. They always show up. Sometimes they won’t have the best game but they’re trying. So thank you guys for always doing your best and playing hard. Same can’t be said about the defense tho(except for Kendricks, smith and Woods)
We won! Even wearing our cute, pastel-purple jammies.  Who on earth thought of those uniforms? Carl Eller wouldn't have worn them
Only the Vikings can be up 4 TDs...& make it a nail-biter😞
All I can think about is what Henry could have done to the def if he were able to play today😔
Chase Claypool is getting out of control.
i hate when players celebrate while losing i never understood that mindset
A 29 point lead ... Blown ...  Worse than Patriots/Falcons SB...  And they lost to Detroit ...  What kind of team does this...
I honestly cant tell if the Vikings have a good offense or if Pittsburgh's defense is just terrible
Vikings rule!
As a Texas fan i will say. Kris Boyd is trash.
Steelers fought hard. Got to salute them and the coaching staff
Justin Jefferson aka 2JAY....Hit Em UP
Give me the  State Farm shill  that’s a known liar and I will consider your insurance for purchase.
7:00 that Kendricks push against deonta Johnson , so fun to watch
Pittsburgh cowboys 🤠
Another perfectly good highlight reel ruined having to listen to Joe buck state the obvious, with the vocabulary of a 10 year old
Fryermouth got Destroyed by 3 Guys!!  Talk about trying to take one for the team and still doing so in a Loss (Because Claypool is an idiot).
Man, the steelers defence needs work
Love 💘 the uniforms
Big Ben has come back ib the last two games but cant finish it the play calling early in the game and BIg Ben said im done let me call the plays and they almost had uit
Think several times before making bet in Vikings game. Even with 29-0 score)
Although they lost best game I seen the Steelers play all season.
Vikings lose to CHI ON MONDAY AND SEASON IS OVER, bye bye Zimmer!  Thank God!!
Harrison smith is the most underrated safety in nfl history
5:44 and 6:14 Najee Harris couldn't have done less to protect Ben. O-line was dogshit too
Love the game.  Calling all owners&players in the NFL,NHL,NBA&MLB to donate 20%&10% respectively this financially tough holiday season 4 food security, kids toys,sweets,books& hygienik products. Will lovingly volunteer brain&muscle 2 deliver the goods throughout North America days before X-Mas.
To think I almost stopped watching the video in the beginning of the third, glad I didn't
if rothlessberger just had a few more seconds to through i think we would have won that rip big ben
Grown men playing a rough sport but give someone a tiny shove and it’s unnecessary roughness. This sport used to be so much better back in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
Did they say Big Ben doesn’t even practice? Lmao 😂
I love the Vikings 💜💛, even when they suck
Please someone tell me what is wrong with Cousins? How is it that sometimes he throws these perfect dimes to his receivers and then, like in the second half of the Steeler game and so many others, it’s like he’s trying to give the game away? You can just see the frustration in JJ (he just hasn’t learned to hide it yet). Just so inconsistent. Wish we could trust him to lead the team to victory like Ben almost did. Throw out the stats, give me a winner.
Remember Vikes fans...all the terrible plays in the 2nd half are all coachable issues.....this team does not improve because of the coaching.
The Steelers look...celebrating in the end zone when yer down 29-7.
How can you be up by 29 points, then just barely eek out a win. SMDH Vikings.
Roethlisberger has been overrated for a decade.
Breeland also should have been flagged in the 1st qtr. 16:40.  Home cookin'.
Hats off to da Steelers for fighting like dat, legendary game
I actually enjoy when there’s fans for both teams at the stadium :) it makes the game sound more fun  and intense
The steel curtain is as thin & strong as silk
Need to change fckng rules one of the both have the Ball, and the rule gives to offense, and the another very important rule, is the pass interference... The bad pass now are a pass interference? Wtf
GREAT GAME  VIKINGS..... EXCITING...❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄
Steelers suck
If only Ben had a strong arm and could throw guys open like he used to....now it's basically 10 yard passes. Glad they showed some heart near the end.
Guess Ben should've gone to practice more lol
Omg cut vikings kicker he sucks assss
Must be hard to be a Steelers fan these days. But they just get going too late. Now 6-6-1 with these teams ahead of them: Titans, Chiefs, Browns, Ravens. Looks like a tough slate. They just don't seem good enough. Another excellent game for we fans, though. As for the Vikings, they seem to have a lot of serious talent, but they are 6-7. What's up with that?
Who designed the Vikings uniforms? The people at Looney Toons? It's like watching a cartoon about football.
As I always say, "When the Steelers lose, Americia wins!"
Come home
@ 10:10 Superbowl catch play
funny, I turned this off the first time assuming the pass was good and the skol fell out!!!
Our O line is now so bad they're spreading it to the D line
That catch by clay pool was the flyest sh*t I seen in a minute
Every other week the Steelers are awesome, every other week they suck. Today they great just came up a little short...
Call membrane
☝️☝️☝️☝️🤳🏽🤳🏽
Vikings suck
Man those lanes Cook had to run through!
Time for a new head coach. The Steelers are so undisciplined and unprofessional. Another year of great hope but end up with great disappointment.
Get Jefferson a QB!
The Steelers defense is flat out terrible, particularly against the run.  I don't remember them ever being this bad and I've been watching the Steelers for an incredibly long time.
Whenever someone tells the Steelers to quit, they don't (but still came up short in the end)
Bottom dwellers
Troy Aikman is the best announcer in football.  He is fair, and he knows the game inside and out.
Friarmuth ain't no T.O. (49er the catch II)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9tfB1OU5I
bruh when ben threw the pick dionte got bodied by kendricks on the return
shittiest sport ever seen
The Steelers Recieving Core was making some CRAZY catches. Props to them
vale madre ese pinch3 dumblin ya nomas no la arma .
Imagine if the Steelers played the first half like they did the second half.
Sad that we choked but happy we made sort of a comeback
Pain for a steealers fan right here
Cooked just cooked the Steelers.
Does Ego, Antonio Brown, Claypool, immaturity ring a bell. Samo samo
DID Y'ALL SEE 👀THE FIRST FOUR SECONDS OF THE AFTERGAME INTERVIEW  ? DID YOU WATCH ERIN ANDREWS BELOW THE WAIST  ? SEXXXXXY  !😍
Vikings got horrible defense. The only reason they won was Claypool celebration wasted time.
Where’s the flag? They threw one on minkah for doing the exact same thing. I can’t believe how bad and inconsistent the officiating has been
Love watching steelers get beat up…their time as the big dog on the block is over and long gone…the have beens..lol
How nice it would be if all the steelers games were like what we saw in that third and fourth quarter. Great protection, agressive offense, all receivers being involved, defense stealing some balls, i wish they played like that the whole game because the first half was horrible overall, maybe worse than the first half of the second game against the bengals.
John 14:13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
America, the land of the brave, unless you play football LOL, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatpVqDGIu4&ab_channel=DieHardRugby I love America, the last hope for civilization but NFL? seriously brave?
Pass the ball, have a break, pass the ball, have a break. Here is real football. No girlie helmets and padding LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatpVqDGIu4&ab_channel=DieHardRugby
Can I say it? Can I say it... I'm going to say it! JJefferson is a better wr than Moss. Not as explosive but an all around better player. Moss had a HOFer opposite him. Jefferson has Thielen who is a good player but he's always injured. Jefferson is that dude. The only thing he can't do is dance. His TD routine is lame. Lol.
The incredible catches in this game.
Ben needs to turn it on like he did in the 4th from the start
Claypool's boneheaded play should be a highlight
Big Ben seems to do much better in no huddle, just racking up points and coming back in games.  Maybe the Steelers should do no huddle all the time.
Imagine Ben+Tomlin on a team like the Browns. The Browns would be owning this division.
4 posession game at the half and the vikings still find a way to make it close. Feels like a loss tbh.
Vikings just lost to the lions and then beat the Steelers 🗿. Wtf is this season
This games is just another example that Mike Tomlin is the problem in Pittsburgh an Big Ben is still grinding enough to win
Ben played amazing and his only pic was due to Johnsons lack of awareness and effort. Last throw of the game was pin point accurate. Its too bad Muth couldn't hang on it
I only came to see Claypools buffoonery and it’s not even here
@9:51 but why tho? 🤷🏾‍♂️ yall were down three touchdowns!
Go Cowboys. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Didn’t the Vikings have the momentum with a running game and then they switched to incomplete passes to run the clock?
I knew cook faked that injury to make the fumble look not as bad.
Too too many points/ plays allowed by steelers D need overhaul the secondary
With ALL DUE RESPECT THIS IS WHY HIGH PRICED VET QBS ARE LET GO THE TIED UP SALARY COULD BE USED ELSEWHERE  BY STEELERS SHOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL TO BEN BUT......
Is Dalvin Cook locked up$$$ he needs to be what a difference  maker
This game was loaded with bullshit calls.
It is time for Roethelsberger to retirr.
How do you almost blow a 29:0 lead at the end of the 3rd quarter ? Unbelievable.
Oh. My wow I’m so happy 😃. For the Vikings
If this Vikings defense can be like what they were in the first half, and the offense. This team will be dangerous if they make the playoffs.
Leave it up to the Vikings to create a nail biter out of a slam-dunk!
I didn’t even realize how close this game was till I watch the highlight but woeow
Scripted
16:09 Claypool wants him to get out of bounds when he had just wasted time lol
That Claypool catch at 15:03 is one of the craziest catches I have ever seen
Amazing they won!!!
Like that dude barr is not a good player. He tried to hurt other players. Can't play the game without being dirty huh?! You dude are one pathetic ass excuse for a nfl player. Wouldn't need to try and use your dirty tactics to try and hurt players if you would actually train. You can tell you are one of those people who cuts corners. Always trying to get ahead. Can't be a man and just accept it. Pathetic
I'm mad as hell, I forgot to see if Cook was gonna play or not and I ended up leaving Mattison in my starting lineup and he only got me 2.70 points😡😡🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Tbh, Freiermuth should've held the ball to his chest as soon as it touched his hands, that way he would've still made the catch despite the big hit🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
STILLERS GHANTA SUPAHR BOHWL!!!
*Is it me or does Tomlin always look like a deer in the headlights ??😯🚘🦌*
11:30 horrible PI call
Cook was a beast
The kickers though. What was this, a Packers v Bengals rematch?
as a steelers fan i hate claypool. cut him. put james washington in
Much better coverage of the last play in the other NFL video. (Wild Ending!!! Steelers Almost Have Comeback Of The Year in Steelers vs. Vikings)
One of the craziest games I’ve ever witnessed
I like Chase Claypool he has a game that speaks for itself, unfortunately sometimes he himself speaks for it and that can cost him and his team games. I feel that as long as that troubled and cocky mindset is gone he would play exceptionally better than this game. And that’s not taking anything away from this game that he had either, I seriously believe he could be better if his mouth and his cockiness didn’t get in the way of his game. There’s a time and place for trash talk.
Minnesota cheated at home!! Of course!
Good effort by Pittsburgh after poor start.
Honestly as a Steelers fan taco charlton was making some pretty good plays
One of the best nfl games I’ve been to
When is last time we saw a New England coached team get dumb personal foul penalties.
6:16 omfggg what’s 53 & 51 doing??? These guys never played linemen before… get em tf out mane
Ben needs to be ol'yellered. He's been trash for about 5,6 seasons now. Blame everyone for the loss except him, he's only a statue trying to play football.
The play on 3:20 shows Steelers need a new o-lineman… all four Vikings broke through 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Steelers are so trash.   Once the packers beat that entire garbage division I’m going to come back here and clown on all of you
Well maybe Ben needs to start showing up for practice.

9:52 what are you celebrating for? Your team is still behind
Pissburgh loses again? How sad.
When your up 26 -0 and 29-7 wth are the coaches still slinging the ball around the field ? Zimmerman and some of these players on vikings have taken turns choking and muffin punts all year. Put the ball in safe power backs stomach. If you gotta run a fb to do that go to a power run and eat clock up. Its a no brainer your just asking for the opponent to get back in it if you pass heavy to run up points on them.
Mike tomlim and big Ben the scapegoats for the NFL scripting their offense to be one yard passes all game.
this is the way i like it
once again , start to play too late
ben don't cry
Great game
Clay pool beast
Classpool johnson and Washington are catching some crazy balls from a sling shot arm
8:38-9:03 🤦🏼‍♂️
How spoon just stop running???? He needs to be  Evaluated!!! That didn't look right!!! Iiiike if $$$$ was on the line!!!!!
Arrrrrgh Steelers ! WHY ?  How can you loose with the Vikings 29 Points ahead ?  You knew the drill.
If you had a stealers offensive lineman in your fantasy team it’s gonna be rough week
Vikings tried really hard to blow it.
AB would’ve caught it
The Pittsburgh Steelers: looking down on their completion yet again only to be bailed out by high end talent.   Here I come to save the day indeed.  The Minnesota Vikings: choking away winnable games in hilarious fashion like the Chargers and Falcons before them.   God damn it, Minnesota, why do you always do this to your own fans?  Also the Vikings: get away with an ugly win, somehow.  Also the Steelers: blow away a chance at a comeback cause one of their receivers decided to be an egotistical idiot and taunt a completed 1st down with seconds left before the game ends.  A fitting narrative between two teams who couldn't beat the then winless Detroit Lions.
What is with all of the missed FGs and extra points this year?  Did they change the inflation of the ball or something else?
I love this team I have been a fan for many years great job guys I couldn't ask for more!!!!!!!
Almost one hell of a come-back. Shouldnt have let it get out of hand like that though. I really would like to see James Washington get more attention the rest of the season. I hope he is a Steeler for the rest of his career. No Diva attitude. No Me, me, me. Just work work work.
YikesVikes!!!!
No more steelers, they are ruining my picks. What has gotten into to these guys??? Next thing you know Broncos will be wanting Ben instead of Rodgers!!!
Cook was good
Pass interference
Color rush Jersey inserted into the system : in my robotic voice
long throws, touchdowns, interceptions, sacks, tight till the very last second, what a beautiful football game!
SKOL!!!!
That was scary , I literally thought Steelers had already lost , props to them for that beautiful game
What a game! Claypool, Wow!
Dalvin cook is so fast
After those several yards Ben did he’s now planning on skipping the next game due to a bruised hammy.
Harrison Smith is one of my favorite safeties in the league. The fact he wear those black sleeves ans gloves every game no matter what truly grants him black airforce energy
Ben need to run…watching him scramble that 4 yard for the first down was like watching my dad…70 yrs old, with 3 knee replacements, scramble
Personal Foul.  Defense.  Touching another player.  Automatic Superbowl win.
Cook is going to be a great back if he stays healthy!!
Again...why is ben still there. At this stage of the season the Steelers need to blood the incumbent QB. Nice win Vikings
I didn't realize Roethlisberger was still playing in the NFL lol
Yessir  Son
Cook goated
That 3 yard gain my Harris showed me his dedication to the game I’m just sayin
I’m not a fan of either team but thats my favourite game of the season so far
At least one purple team beat up on them squeelers ray rice for president
Like Brady says when they play shutout defense eventually later the flood gates will open they can't go like that all game
Somebody get Deestroying a job man. These kickers are mediocre
You can't drop that TD pass on the last play! You just can't!
Cook took 10 yards each time he ran the ball! My god!
Missed the full game, but was wondering how the Vikings gave up so many TDs in the second half. Now I see that the really didn't. Defense was still strong. It's just that the Steeler wide receivers just made some amazing catches that ended up keeping them in the ball game.
What a crazy ending to the Steelers-Vikings game last night. Steelers could have a chance to tie the game if Claypool did not waster his time celebrating after his late 1st down catch.
Dalvin cook was on they ass
harrison smith shows again why he is the best safety in the league
As a vikes fan I was honestly rooting for the steelers at the end. Biggest comeback ever would have been cool. It’s a garbage season anyways who cares.
Harrison Smith saved Mike Zimmer's job on that final play. Salute to him!
Trying to watch the highlights so many ads 🙄
Ain’t no way……ain’t no way
The Cardiac Caterans? They're still on the outside of an NFC playoff spot, but I wouldn't bet against them.
Captain Cousins is the least clutch QB in history change my mind
Just posted a heated Lamar vs Rodgers video make sure to go check it out and leave some feedback
https://youtu.be/x13clEJAUuY
I KNEW THE PITTSBURGH PATHETICS. I MEAN STEELERS WOULD LOSE THAT GAME.
Harrison Smith better end up in the hall of fame.
Honestly way to almost give it away 😂😂
Great game. Dalvin Cook was amazing, Cousins should have kept feeding him the ball. Big Ben can still get it done, but his offensive line was trash. Thanks for posting this NFL, you guys rock!
Steelers are the weirdest team in the league. You got their defense celebrating a INT down 22 at the bottom of the 3rd, Chase celebrating a first down while wasting clock time, Big Ben running looks like someones disabled grandma…lol
First half: What the Vikings could be this year.   Second half: What the Vikings have been this year.   I was completely embarrassed and stressed out as a Vikings fan in that 2nd half.
Dumb going for two
steelers fans felt what ravens fans felt last week
THIS CLOSE ( 🙏 ) LOSS  WAS MORE PROOF THAT THE VIKINGS WERE JUST NOT MEANT TO BEAT THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS  !
flicks his helmet with a finger ffs, "unneccessary roughness" , give me a break
Nice win for the Vikings last night
This was a good game
K.J Osborn not getting the recognition he deserves. He's been a really underappreciated player for the Vikings this year. Compliments both Thielen and Jefferson well
Claypool a liability
Dalvin Cook is a beast , for him to ran for 205 yard and 2 TD , playing hurt . Wow unreal well done , he got my vote for the top player of this week .
I can’t believe it really came down to the last play
What????  Where is the offense for Pitt  No protection for a great qb     You want to be winners do your f n job    WOW   I’m not a steelers fan at all but sucks when a good QB gets dogged by his supposed friends.  Fire the whole damm offense line  Holy moly!!!!!
Whats that like 3 games in a row where Harrison Smith didnt try to choke someone out?
How many times has Smith bailed us out tho. One of the best safety's to ever play.
I love how Harrison Smith threw his helmet after making the final play of the game for the win, knocking the ball out.  Pretty much sums up most viking fans' feelings at the moment.  Pretty epic end though.
Yertle the Zimmer calling the Prevent Defense with an entire 20 minutes left to play.  How does this calcified fossil still have a job?
Cook was cooking them at first. In the beginning, I thought Pittsburgh didn't come to play. Then they had a change of heart. Minnesota almost had the biggest upset of their season 😅
I'd love to have been a "Fly on the Wall" and heard how coach Tomlin cussed-out his Pittsburgh Steelers after a humiliating 1st half, to get them to compete so hard in the 2nd half and take pride in their jobs. Coach must've really went-in on they ass.
Almost another Lions situation… I stopped watching Vikings after the Lions game so now I will continue to watch highlights only … I can’t mentally deal with the Vikings
Vikings......classic!!!
GAME. OF. THE. YEAR.
1 more thing everybody talking about Poole celebrating after a first down … what about # 25 when he got the pick and brought the whole defense to the end zone to celebrate it was 29-7 end of the 3rd quarter to me that’s just as flagrant as the Poole incident… MY OPINION FELLAS don’t bite my head off plz lol
I love the steelers, not a great start, but came back big time. Let's play 4 quarters against the chiefs
YouTube 5 ads for one video? Seriously 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Justin Jefferson has to have the best td celebration right now
Big Ben doesn’t wanna play anymore I can tell by 1 play #22 at 4:20 is at the line of scrimmage showing blitz all the way instead of shifting the protection wit the audible ben acts like he is not even there four players collapses the right side of the line while 1 player rushed the left side…when u watch film Vikings run that blitz all the time … … big  ben never misses a audible like that I don’t kno what’s goin on but it feel like he is already retired in his mind … ohh yeah I watch film as a fan I can tell u any teams tendencies the ravens need to give me a job shyt I live by the damn stadium lol
SHANNON SHARPE CALLS 911 PARODY 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://youtu.be/2-beyvkIOAE
Dalvin cooked their defense
If the line could protect Ben consistently this team would be far better. Enough with the narrative of Ben's arm being dead, it isn't
Chase Claypool= numb nuts
Nice job Steelers coming from way behind.
YouTube getting a little too comfortable with them 2 ads now.
The Vikings DB's played great football the second half. The Steelers receivers just played even better. They had NO business making those catches!   Also some of those PI's were questionable at best.
The 'Hitman' Harrison Smith shut down this game.  Unlike Aaron Roger's, he stepped away from the game.  Still, after all these years, it's interesting he doesn't have a celebration move.  It would have been funny if he brought back Brian Robison's 'fish on a hook',, or Jared Allen's 'rope a calf''.  Yo, we got 'em!  Tomorrow we feed...SKOL!
They kept calling him mychal kendricks..
Y we can’t catch
Ben needs to sue his Oline because wtf 😂😂
Imagine losing to a team that lost to the Lions I'm happy though my team beat the Steelers
So the Vikings ran out of gas after the third quarter and the Steelers just sat in the locker room until the middle of the third quarter?  Both these teams seem to have forgotten that football is a four-quarter game.
No replay of the final play?
how is 12:05 not a pushing off call? you can literally see Osbourne push off?
*I'm still waiting for the Scooby Doo moment when Chase Claypool pulls off his mask and reveals he's Plaxico Burress LOL!!!*
I don't think you guys realize how close the vikings were to having a falcons moment🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cousins played terrible. He made it close
Blew a 29 point lead to just barely win the game.  Flip dude.
Wonder what Lions fans thought of this game?
16:23 sounded like helmet to helmet contact.
Dude celebrating the 1st down wasting all that time 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Dalvin Cook show! The Vikings Defense quits in the Forth Quarter which has cost them all of their games they lost this year!
Ads are a little out of hand now NFL  What the hell
But You Had Claypool One On One On The Chair Route My Good Buddy…”smdh Good Game Been Said, Big Ben Out Played Kirk To Say The Least.”
Clay Chasepool is easily one of the more naive or foolish players in the NFL
Steelers scored heavy in the 4th quarter for nothing, like when they faced my precious Chargers. Congrats to Vikings for winning just days after losing to the previously-winless Lions.
Cousins being Cousins, Jefferson needs superglue, Vikings coaching staff yeeting plays as usual, Vikes Defense had a blast and the O-line actually doing good? :O But that Dalvin Cook though... on fiyaaaah!
Two teams that lost and tied the Lions were on display here. It showed.
stupid/noob question … does the qb and receiver  get the yardage for pass interference plays?
Too bad that Viking allowed Steelers to almost reach them. If the last throw would had happened, it would have been one of the worst comebacks in NFL history. I’m glad that Viking have won. Their defense were godly good in the first half and offense were even better. I hope they’ll win their next game so they’ll be able to reach the playoffs. Playoffs wouldn’t be that much fun without Vikings. GG Vikings ang Nice try Steelers, better luck next time.
Joe buck doesn’t even sound like he wants to be there
Jj struggled a bit
Vikings had more want in this game. Steelers looked old and tired.
Kirk was so bad that game
The last throw, catch and hit by woods had my heart rate out of control
The steelers came in bruised and tired from the ravens game...poor vikings letting them back in
NFL, please start showing the flight path of a thrown or kicked ball. like protracer in golf
i like how making a big play and flexing as you get up is taunting, but getting a pick and running all the way to the endzone for a photo OP down 21 isnt taunting lmaoooo
I'm a Steelers fan until I die. They're struggling this season, but know how to make a football game interesting. I think if friermuth caught that TD pass with no time left, they wouldn't have made the 2pt conv and still lost 34-36.
Pass should have been caught in the end🤪
Exciting game but 2 teams showing the world how not to play Football.
Another minute of this game Pittsburgh would of came back and embarrassed the Vikings🤣😂 Pittsburgh should of played like they did the second in the first
great try on the last play by the receiver.
tbe most thing i hate about nfl is the celebration while you're losing by a big margin , celebrate an interception while losing by 21
Didn’t show Claypool Celebrating a first down that may have caused him the game.
I had to get up for work, at 4:30 this morning, and I knew I couldn't go to bed with a 29-0 lead. That's what the Vikings are doing to their fans this year
NFL PLEASES BRING A CANADIAN TEAM ALL CFL THINGS SUCKS
2 minutes left in the third...your defense has been shredded the entire game...you manage to pick off a pass...then you want to motion everyone down the field to celebrate with you in front of the cameras for finally doing your job in a game that you ain't going to win because they have been making you look silly for the past 43 minutes...class act Pittsburgh....
I can’t believe the Steelers keep on getting these lucky comebacks
That was a pretty wild game!!  Kind of an ugly win for the Vikings to blow such a big lead.  But they can thank Chase Claypool for foolishly celebrating his 4th down conversion and burning valuable seconds off the clock.
Chase pool = 🤡 Go Browns
Why can’t the Steelers play every game like it’s the 2nd half?
Steelers had no right to be in that game.. Big Ben went from playing like a QB who's about to retire, to playing like he's on a contract year 😆
Claypool is AB and juju's child lmao
"Here's a pass contended"  Oh Joe Buck, you eloquent wordsmith.
I'm so happy the NFL is here to hand out 15 yard penalties for the crime of hurting a grown-ass man's feefees. Don't forget the binkie and crib on the sideline!
There have been more deaths due to heart attacks in Minnesota than from Covid this year.
Mann tbh I didn't even finish watching this highlight. I'm freaking pissed!!
I just put James Washington on my fantasy football team
Hoo, Boy.  I really feel sorry for Big Ben.  It was tiring hearing "no chance for Roethlisberger".  And the kicking?  2 field goals and 1 extra point missed.  In a domed stadium?  The kickers should be ashamed of themselves.  0 seconds left?  Damn good game!
Who’s worse than the Steelers? The Vikings.
16:22
Oh man thats tuff …
Why did they stop running the ball???
Ben is definitely slower than Brady!😭
Vikings are the Vikings mediocre team  Zimmers last year
Too many pies big ben
Decent effort from the Steelers, but Vikings gave them nearly every opportunity to come back.  So many stupid plays, stupid fouls from sloppy play etc
00:22 I don’t think kj was down
Pass interference calls are getting out of hand
What's with the Vikes?  Up 29-0 for almost three quarters and you ALMOST LOSE THE FRICKING GAME?  DAFAQ?  The way they've played this season, they could be up 50-0 at the beginning of the fourth quarter and I'd still pucker until the end of the game.  Jesus.
YOUTUBE YOU ARE A JOKE. 7 MINS IN AND ALREADY SAW 6 ADVERTS. I’M GONNA DEAF YOUTUBE AND WATCH NFL HIGHLIGHTS ON MY GAME PASS - BECAUSE THIS BARELY WATCHABLE.
What a game!
Great game!!
Everytime Big Ben throw I either cringe or laugh 🤦🏾..
Harrison Smith is good.
The ending to this game is literally how Baltimore lost to Pittsburgh last week. Just a simple matter of catching the last pass to end the game. It was Mark Andrew’s last week for the ravens that couldn’t hall it in.
Deontae Johnson needs to learn to play through contact more. Might be P.I. but still needs to put in max effort.
Thank god we won....yay...
Man, what a game! Vikings run game looked unstoppable in the 1st half. Cook is slippery.  Kirk Cousins was dead-on target. Still a shutout until 2:11 in the 3rd qtr. Ben still has it. Trailing by 9 in the 4th qtr. The pass at 12:08 was a thing of beauty. Another INT and TD allowed by Minn. Pitt still on the wrong side of the 50, trailing by 8. With no timeouts Pitt still had a chance with 2 sec. left but couldn't complete the pass for a potentially game-tying TD. Pittsburgh - too little, too late. Converting only 4 of 13 3rd downs. Vikings win!!!
Boswell should never miss a field goal. Veteran (automatic).
Steelers are hard to watch this season
Devin Bush is the Steelers answer at middle linebacker only if the question is “What would it take for an NFL team to give up 300 yards rushing a game?”
Imagine calling a push off, couldn't be the refs
Im gonna say kirk is the 🐐
It's hard to believe those two halves were from the same game.
Ref got a little DRAMATIC with that HOLDING call on the OFFENSE didn't he? I have a feeling he was really into this game. Wasn't a bad game after all.🤠
Perhaps most irritating are the missed kicks. The Vikings should have had 40 points, not 36.
Jefferson already frustrated with Cousins LOL. Peep his body language after Cousins misses him three times this game. 9:45, he had the underneath route wide open.
Vikings looking like Seattle’s apprentice when giving heart attacks in close games, good job Vikings, maybe next time Steelers.
We should of kept Whiterspoon 😤 #49ers
The Minnesota Vikings are 6-7 despite leading 29-0 in the 3rd Quarter 🟣🟡
That was great throw by Kirk jefferson almost had but a great connection is building between those 2  Witherspoon made a nice interception but why’d they even throw it just run it ur up with 4 minutes left
When you think about it, the Vikings are just the NFC version of the Steelers.  So much talent and potential, yet still with an innate ability to crap their pants so hard that birds start falling out of the sky.
yo claypool is a beast
the way that the steelers almost made a spectacular comeback from 29 points in the second half alone. vikings defence wasn’t to good in 2cnd half. gg
whata a nail bitter. nice game! dont like the steelers at all.
Holy push off on Osborn for their last TD tho Jesus
I heard booing.   Good!  Zimmer needs to go.  The Vikings should have blown this game so the Wilfs would have had an excuse to fire both Zimmer and Rick Spielman.
I can't believe that the Pittsburgh Steelers lost!!! I'm mad that the Pittsburgh Steelers lost!!! 😠😠😠😠😠!!! I'm mad!!!
Smith saved zimmer right at the end
Big Ben looked VINTAGE in that 2nd half!!!!!!!
Gotta feel for Freiermuth there
as a steelers fan i say that their defense and offensive line stank in this game.   i cant believe that they almost came all the way back to win,  down by 29 points with 6 minutes left in the 3rd quarter.   kudos to the vikings for hanging on to win.   as a steelers fan i dread next year without ben. i wonder who the quarterback will be?
16:23 im pretty sure some vikings fans legit ended up in the hospital after seeing that Little Frame
Not shown here but .... Claypool's stupid selfish 1st down reaction no the last drive cost the Steelers many seconds, it's all about him !!!  Very talented but also a clown !!!!!!
Pittsburgh came back pretty good!
"Big Ben" needs to hang up his cleats - NOW. Another case of a once-great QB, "staying too long".
#0952 JET LIFE
Big Ben is done next year  will be his final year this was over before it got started in the first half
Dam I don't follow any of them but it was a action packed game
Only we can win a game this way...
Always satisfying to see a steeler start something and actually get flagged for it.  More often than not a Steeler will pick a fight and it's the retaliator that gets flagged.  Good on the refs flagging claypool rather than the defender.
I'm a Steelers fan, why the hell do we need to have a heart attack every week? Why can they just play as good as the 4th quarter every time? I hate you, I love you  And man that was an insane play by Harrison Smith, all the credit to him and gg
That was good sportsmanship from Claypool with Patterson
It was the battle of the backs for awhile sheesh🤧
Vikings probably choke more than any other team sorry not probably I meant, most likely to
Gets pick celebrates when down 7 to 29... Yup makes sense
It’s 7 to 29 at 9:52  , is that really necessary?? Immature ass players
There are soooo many issues with the Steelers on both sides of the ball, as a long time Steelers fan I hate to say this, I don't see how they make the playoffs. 😞 Pittsburgh's D still can't stop the opponents running game, the O- line can't protect Big Ben nor open holes for RB Najee Harris and worst, K Boswell is no longer a reliable FG kicker. His missed FG in the 1st quarter was the difference in Pittsburgh losing. Plus, HC Tomlin needs to implement DISCIPLINE in players, making stupid, bonehead penalties or too much showboating when losing by a lot. ((another issue with the Steelers). 😠 Good chance, the Steelers will be out of the playoffs, again. 😒
Big Ben is just useless they will have at least 10 wins as soon as they replace him
It was at 3:35 in the third quarter where it all went bad for the Vikings
This video had almost as many ads as the game
Like they say, the best defense is a good offense. The Vikings defense is at it's best when they're on the sidelines.
I don't really get involved in the games when one of the teams isn't mine(Cardinals) but damn I was rooting for the Steelers cause I love a come back. Great 4th quarter, the only part that I saw!
This went from a Snoozzzzzy 2 a Doozy
2nd half is the only time the steelers become good
Trade claypool now or he will have no value cuz he has shyt character.
That was a close game !!!
When the team that lost to the Lions beats the team that tied to the Lions.
It 28 to 36
AKA the "No Win Lions Bowl"
All you idiots acting like you saved the world after a touchdown, take a look at the standings when your still down 4 games. Your celebration and touchdown mean nothing. Your so far back on standings . Yay I got a touchdown, I make a million dollars. Your celebrations are clearly your flaws. Lol, ridiculous when your back 2-4 or more games and you act like a touchdown just saved the season. Get a grip you idiots.
Clay pool is such a tool they were in hurry up offense less than a minute to go and he’s celebrating with the football while down 8 points
Great f… game
Im not saying what Chase did was right but Breeland retaliated and the penalty should have been canceled
Everybody is talking about Claypool costing the Steelers 5 seconds. True...but he also made some great catches to get them in position to win. Look...all he needs is some coaching. The dude can ball. When there is skirmishes he is quick to defend his teammates. He was also the first one to offer support to Muth when he dropped the ball for a potential tying TD. All this talk about getting rid of him is premature. He will learn from his mistakes.
How does Jefferson get that open? They were bracketing him all night
Bring back the outdoor stadium for the Vikings. The Packers enjoy this advantage. Can we ever find another Bud Grant? Four SB appearances. We have to dump our present coach, now
Cook touchdown cousins first down pass Roethlisberger wood sack Harris Jefferson field goal 23 yarda interception bleeder  124 yard 3rd and 2 Washington complete 100 yards
Nuts, can’t believe he caught it at 15:10
That is Best Ben Look all Year, time to Go Ben!!!
Lions:  We would have lost that game. Packers:  If that were the NFC championship, we would have lost Bears: How the f do you score 30 points?
The Steelers wide receivers made some incredible catches! Too bad they couldn't finish it!
The Viqueens haven't played this well since Bretty FaRve was their QB !! 🤣😆🥱
If Steelers would of played as hard in the beginning as they did in the last half they would have won. Kills me when these teams think it's ok to pick up the pace only in the second half
Claypool was hardly the only idiot in this game. Just the biggest.  8:41 You're leading by 29 points and have just knocked the Steelers back to a 3rd-and-long, with a chance to put the game away, and instead of walking back to the huddle, you just can't help yourself and have to taunt the guy you just tackled, as though you just cured cancer or something. This leads to a Steelers TD, which ends up giving them a chance to tie the game on the final play. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.  9:50 You're down by 22 points late in the 3rd, and all you can think about is, "Where are the cameras at?" Try going back to the sidelines and figure out how to not allow 200+ yards rushing and 7.5+ yards per carry maybe.   15:50 And of course the NFL curates-out Claypool showing the world that all he cares about is personal glory instead of helping Pittsburgh win the game. He got up after getting the first down, with the clock running and the Steelers w/o any timeouts, and has to strike a pose showing what an impressive superhero he is for having picked up a 1st down instead of hustling to get the ball spotted for the next snap....and then has the audacity to throw a fit at the offensive lineman who had  the gall to interrupt his celebration in order to get the ball set.
At 2:41 it looks like chase claypool didn’t even try to block Xavier woods. He didn’t even get his hands on him
Is it just me, or is the Steelers offensive line completely useless? Can't open a whole for the RB, can't keep the defense off of the QB..... Seems maybe their problems are more than an aging QB. Oh and just curious, why did Witherspoon feel the need to run 40 yards for a pose down after the INT? Christ man, act like you been there before!
Why can't we play like we did in the 2nd half for an entire game?
Fox Sports Radio was calling for Ben to be benched when it was 26-0. I was thinking, "No!", it's Big Ben. How can you give up on the guy so quickly?
Im glad the world got to witness what its like being a viking fan, we go thru this every week😪😭
Another rigged NFL game to keep the viewers and fans tuned in and in their seats until the last minute of the game.  Sponsors pay based on viewership for each 30 second spot.  Too many games going to the last play and too many teams tied for win/loss to keep fans involved.  RIGGED NFL.
Tomlin Out
The Vikes can scrap the bubble screen to Jefferson. It's no longer working.
So…Many….ADS!
Amusing how cocky the Vikings players are when they make a play they are paid to make. And are just inches away from blowing a 29-point lead. Maybe work on your celebrations when you're home watching the playoffs.
Tomlin wants to be a “players coach”.  Claypool acts like a child and he needs to go.  We’ve seen this before with this team (ju-ju, AB and Bell). He can’t control these guys.
They let Dalvin rush for 200 yards with a broken arm thats crazy
I love claypool's "what?  what I'd do?" move after poking breeland in the face 0:48  roethlisberger must've been sore after this game.  I've never seen a QB get sacked so many times.
Wouldn't be such a bad idea to fire cousins honestly. Let's get someone w some potential in here. Cousins is really bad about giving the game away
I'm sorry but as a steeler fan I can say we STINK this year..... but to let us ALMOST win after being up 29 to 0.... the Vikings stink even more this year and I didn't think that was possible....
Steelers  fans are not happy about this the steelers  needed this win to stay in the playoff hunt
Chris Boyd taunting penalty when the game was done…. Crazy how it all stemmed from that. What a wild game.
i didnt watch the whole game but i did see the vikings go up by 29-0 i believe.  the vikings have a talented squad and i looked at the games they lost and wonder why they have terrible record. answer the coaching. why in the world if you Cook and the other running back  running like they were , would you throw the ball so much. the steelers could not stop the run but the stupid vikings let them hang in the game by throwing ,stopping the clock and putting the ball in jeopardy i.e.2 interceptions. Vikings coaching staff take a page from Belichick and play to win the game not for style points!!!!
All of Roethlisberger's passes were jump balls
Pitt showed up in 2nd half
Ya jubilen al Big Ben... solo da lastima.. gracias por todo pero necesitamos sangre joven.
love how the refs flag buddy for flexing on washington after absolutely crushing him, but on an interception the whole team has turkey dinner, does back flips, pose for a picture but that’s alright 🤣
If rothlisberger wasn't so damn fat he'd be able to get away. It look like buddy ass can't even move 😭😭😭
Why was Claypool selfishly wasting time at the end not included? That had a huge impact on Pittsburgh.
Big Ben giving dudes across America hope in being able to say they have the body of a professional athlete.
Lol, this game didn't have any highlights.
steelers tied with the lions, vikings lost to them... this is just the wild card game to see who deserves to have a rematch against detroit
I'm amazed the Steelers made a game of it after getting down by so much.    So close.
Good job Minnesota Vikings beating the Steelers now the Browns if they beat the Ravens on Sunday they'll jump ahead of the Steelers and move into third place and the Steelers will fall into last place
If only the Steelers played defense in the first half, wouldn’t have been such a bad deficit to come back from
Oof. If he woulda caught that lol
As a Vikings fan I must say this was the worst win of all time
Ben looked like he about to quit. Or someone getting fired at end of season. Probably both.
Ben should just retire already unfortunately
only the vikings
Ben ass need to hang it up
how many fcking ads can you pack in one video Jesus
Fryermuthe
I love how they waited til the end of the game to realize that holding calls against offense were actually a thing bc that's the only reason cousin's wasn't sacked every other play and its the only way you can stop the Steelers defense period.
If the steelers would have remember what time the game started they might have won the game
That was a FUKInG game right there!! The last play was awesome. So much on the line. Down to the last play. What a game
this game was honestly fun to watch moving out the beef, flags, and unnecessary celebrations
2021https://youtu.be/JjsMzDjWjMw
Steelers goin ply spoiler since they been eliminated for not winning this game
Nothing but a bunch of penalties and no calls to let the steelers back in the game before people change the channel nfl is so rigged
New England's advantage is they teach players to not to defeat the team with individual  selfishness. So many  cost their teams by taunting like childern.
Claypool is a punk
that bomb by cousins. jeez
Big Ben eating too much chili lol
Rothesberger plays just like a burger, FLAT !!
How do you miss kicks indoors on fake grass? Fisher price football. Geez.
Ben is the problem... I'd rather start Mason Rudolph at this point...
How are you not gonna show Claypool’s time wasting mistake? Step your highlights up.
Amazing game, but almost unwatchable for all the celebrations and emotional outbursts. Like tackling a guy *after* he gets a 1st down, when you're down by 9? Or picking off a qb, getting tackled, and *then* running the length of the field to put on a Broadway show in the endzone when you're down by 22 points? MN was just as bad at times, but not losing the game. It's just pure cringe at this point. Pro and college FB has become so immature and theatrical, generally speaking. All that energy to party mid-game, but can't hold a tackle or even a lead. Then they'll give up a big play and cry and pout on the bench. It's like peewee football level maturity.
This is exactly why I love the Vikings,,, almost gave me a hart attack 🙄😂😂❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜
Down 29-7 and celebrating a pick like you won the game
As a Steelers fan I'd say we needed that victory 😔 a great match against a great team tho! GGs Vikings!
Good.       -Random Ravens Fan
Where's the heart in my Steelers??? Do we want to win or not??
The refball in this game was absolutely disgusting, WWE is less scripted than this garbage.
rip demariyus thomas
Short pass n cook is cooking
I hate it when one stupid player screws up the game. I knew when that guy looked down at the guy on the ground he was gonna get taunting call. That’s what got the steelers going
talk about a thursday night special! one of the best games of football ive seen all season
1:00 Wow. Cannot even give someone a shove on the shoulder pad w/o a flag. F’n p*ssy league
Steelers ever heard of 'Defence'..?
If Jefferson and Cousins connected on all those passes it would not have been this close.
Great game. Jekyll and Hyde.
Biggest B.S. I've ever seen. Tell me point spread wasn't involved.
Harrison smith with the hit stick to save the game
8:05 is the changing point of the game
Damn that was a tough catch for #88 at the end glad his teammates still gave him props to try to make the play..
The main reason the Steelers were able to climb back into the game was because Cousins did not have a good game had he just been average this game would have been a blow out
Anybody remember the last time Big Ben played against Captain Kirk?
You know Mike Tomlin tore them a new a** at halftime
Wow Pat dropped it, should've been OT
give the game ball to Harrison Smith..."the crusher" knocked it out of Friermuth's hands, otherwise it's overtime and another Vikings loss!
The last throw of the game by ben and that whole last drive was damn near legendary
What game is this? didn't understand anything.
The Steelers came to play only one 1/4  Maybe they should get paid 1/4 of their pay check. We as fan deserved better.
I'm very proud of najee Harris this game
And to think...I stopped watching at the half to play Warzone
Great game thank you Minnesota for hanging on
There was so many ads in this
15:53 Claypool tho
That dropped ball in the end zone at the end of the game, that receiver shouldnt get game pay, and to all you childish players who run to the endzone and celebrate after you intercept a ball OR score a touchdown and you are behind on the score board, grow up and you should lose game day pay....
This game was the most Viking thing ever
As a baltimore fan thank you vikings ✌️
Being a Vikings fan this year is so stressful, any year for that matter
Unbelievable comeback by the Steelers. But, let's be honest, the Vikings almost threw this game away.
OMG!  Been Steelers fan my whole life.   I can’t believe horrible they look.  They couldn’t beat the worst team in the NFL and the just lost horribly to a 5-7 team.   Ben ur a HOFer  congrats but it’s definitely time 4 u retire.
Vikings yet again almost blew a huge lead. The defense got some nice sacks on Big Ben. Props to Steelers for making it interesting. The Vikings haven't had a game that wasn't a nail biter all season basically. SKOL!
Why stop blitzing in the 4th quarter?
Steelers get an A ... for Almost
Helluva game. Almost turned it off
That was a hell of a come back effort from the Steelers. I just wonder if the receiver had managed to hold onto the ball would they have made the 2 point conversion? So many what ifs in a game like this.
Is this irony?  8:41  Kris Boyd commits a taunting penalty while wearing STOP HATE on his helmet.
Only thing I learned about this game is that Kirk Cousins is garbage
keep celebrating claypool😭
Vikings up 16 points with 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter and one of the best RB's of the modern generation after running for 100+ through the first two quarters alone: "yeah let's go 5 wide for the rest of the 4th quarter. They'll never see it coming."
Vikings have a great potential and they should have more wins... Great game though!
Steelers do this all year....they don't score in the first half then have to come back. Vikings do this all year...they take the lead and end up blowing it or making it too close.
Dalvin Cook poppped off
Said by a disgruntled Steelers Fan . 🤣
Too many more games like this and Ben will have retire at the end of the season. Looked like he was having trouble picking himself up off the turf with each sack.
That should have been pass interference at the end but the vikings did play good
Ben should’ve just thrown it to clay pool. With the way he was catching in traffic that was his best chance.
Steelers we’re getting piss nothing called against them
Who cares. Green Bay already won the division.
The Steelers need Mitch to learn from Ben
Zimmer has to go! He is a defensive coach that cannot scheme to stop the opposing team anymore.
Canadian reputation is overdone
Why is Cousins constantly trying to get Jefferson killed 😭😭😭
Must have been laces in on that PAT.
goddamn the vikings really shown out
Harrison smith with that hit at the end, he wanted that game to end bad lol
During the first half or so, I couldn't understand why the Vikings had a losing record and Pittsburg didn't.  Now I do - even with the Steelers losing.
Why does F-muth only have 2 recs in this game. The Steelers never use their tight ends enough. Their offense plan should have a minimum of 2 plays per quarter for tight ends. I have been saying this since Eric Green was there.
Thugs with egos
Some of these penalties are freaking ridiculous man
Let’s go! I scored 46.54 points from last nights game! And I had 3 Vikings players on my team, Kirk Cousins, Justin Jefferson, and Greg Joseph!
1 Of The Best NFL Games I've Seen This Season!!! Congrats To The Minnesota Vikings On The Win!!!
Since when have incomplete passes and penalty have been considered high lights
How tf does a 29-0 game turn into 36-28?? Cmon vikings… 🤦‍♂️
This game is rigged why you throwing when you up 29
These PI calls are ruining football
If the Vikings play the way they play in the first half though the whole game they would probably be undefeated lol but it's the Vikings they are the lions just with more wins lol
No now the lions are out of playoffs
We all knew as Vikings fans they would win this game but it would be close for no reason
huge win Minnesota
Claypool celebrating getting a first down while they are down by 8 with the clock running out is so stupid 😂
Cannot wait for the urinatingtree video on this one
Steelers fans: “I blame Chase Claypool’s immature and irresponsible behavior for costing us precious time to score.”  Me: “So, where did all three of Pittsburgh’s timeouts go in the span of fifteen seconds?”
Claypool got some hands 😳
At 9:35. Joe Buck ... You have one job, and I hate when you call a game. But can you just shut the hell up with the commercial and call the play ?
Great ending
Great job Steelers..
Excellent Game!  Too bad the Steelers waited till the 4th quarter to come alive.
Vikings were a Chase claypool away from blowing a 29-0 lead 🤣🤣
Despite this meaningless win they still lost to the lions. I would have preferred a loss to clean the coaching staff out.
If I was Tomlin, I would introduce my team to the new 'Tomlin Doctrine', 'zero celebrations ever' with dire consequences when violated like fines and suspensions. It's just that you never know when you might need those 8 seconds back.
Wow...now that was a great, gritty game...
hi
Ben and Tom Brady are the scariest quarterbacks in the 4th quarter. You cannot leave 10 seconds on the clock for them. They will find a way to get your blood pressure up. Plus, I am a Bears fan so I was hoping the Vikings would lose.
The Vikings should have just wore their regular uniforms.  The yellow numbers and names look odd.
This makes me happy now ravens have to win our next game then have to beat the Steelers...... let's hope the ravens actually try to play 2 win this time because they didn't even try.
Why is Chase Claypool so mad? You're rich and you get to play football, cheer up bro 🤣
You could see the frustration in Minkah as Dalvin just ran all over them
the taunting and PI flags were so frickin stupid. When will the NFL understand that this game/the players carry around so much emotions.
29-0 at the half, who throws the ball in second half
Kurt Cousins for STATE SENATOR
Kirk Cousins absolutly needs to be sent to the shadow realm to live with all the field goal kickers of the past, how is he going to pay for that ticket? With all his choked passes of course
Steelers needed to play like the 4th quarter the whole game
Kirk Cousins realized that throwing real passes was not something he could possibly do so he decided to start doing that in the second half
13:00. man must be on them newports.   An nfl safety runs 15 yards and is out of breadth. SMH
The ads in this are ridiculous
Is it me or did dalvin cook getting injured make him faster ?
0:44 Claypool has this completely unwarranted attitude about him. Last year he was dead focused on being a great receiver. It is disappointing to see him allow his emotions take control of him.
notice how Breeland got thrown in late in the game and was the one who almost lost the game, rigged!
Cook looked amazing and the steelers looked garbage as usual😎
We not gonna talk about the push off from Osborn to give them a bigger lead ?? 😂 was 20-29 went too 20-36 if you actually watch football, that was a flag and a half but never called LMFAOOO
That game was something serious!! Tuff loss
NUMBER 29 VIKINGS ALMOST TREW THE GAME
You cannot win a football game when you only play for 18 minutes!!!! So sad. Pittsburgh looked pathetic all around most of the game. Time to rebuild this summer...new starting qb, better offensive line, better defensive line, new head coach  Go Stillers!  Thank you for your dedicated service Ben 👏🏻👍🏻✌🏻💕
that cook is a beast!!!
Steelers new strategy moving forward. Just get Najee the ball however you can.
steelers recievers got ton of highlight catches in this game
Ah yes, the two teams that the Lions own.
Boyd had a nice outside trip tackle . Definitely wrestled
STOP GIVING AWAY THE RESULT WITH THE FRONT PHOTO! THERE IS NO POINT AVOIDING THE RESULT TO BE GIVEN THE OUTCOME AS SOON AS YOU LOAD UP THE HIGHLIGHTS
🏈 " Ouch❗" Nice Game Men.  how can they endure all of  the physical pain❓ 💜💛💜💛💜
Leave it to the Vikings to get big leads and give them up, or go down big and make it all the way back to often still lose. I thought 29-0 would’ve been enough, and it almost wasn’t.
Rest In Peace Demaryius Thomas #DT88
Terry Bradshaw is the Vikings logo...
Turned this game off in 3rd quarter. Thanks for the Highlights. I fast forwarded to the last few seconds of this video. The great news is the game ended.
Thank GOD for Harrison Smith!! He's the one to make the big hit on Friermuth on that last play to knock the ball out of his hands.. Without him, this Vikings' defense would be a WHOLE LOT WORST!!
Why the hell are the Vikings passing the ball with a few minutes left and not running it????
Vikings are themost bipolar team in the history of football
Im about listen to so much jayz music
Chase Claypool is an idiot. Good job wasting 10 seconds to celebrate a 9 yard slant. dummy
Ijs big Ben left guards ran to that 1st down before him lol about that time buddy.
Tomlin at the wheel, Tomlin at the wheel!
Im not steelers fan but they was tired as hell only 3 days off that's tuff
The worst part of these NFL highlights are the absolutely AWFUL USAA advertisements...
Zimmer needs to be fired
People can say blew lead yeah but its NFL and Pitt made some great catches but Boyd's flag was turning point letting Pitt back in it instead of 3 and long out of ft range they got automatic fd but we still won and hats off to Pitt for fighting
Thank you for your service Ben but it’s the end!
Are the Vikings the best 6-7 team of all time? I say so.
where is the sack counter
Made this way harder than it needed to be, but got the win. Hats off to the Steelers for not giving up and making it a game in the end. GG to the Steelers
Wow just feel short of an amazing comeback. Good game. Also that TD catch by washington was awesome.
Anyone remember the video of a guy who said “I could do better than the kickers in the NFL” or something like that? Yeah…I could do better than the kickers in the NFL! This year the kickers have been missing SOOOOOO many extra points. Unacceptable.
Pain.... Absolute Pain.
So I guess Dalvins shoulder is ok???
Harrison Smith might've just saved the Vikings season.
This is the only way to watch the NFL. Cut out all the crap.
Im sure the 412 nation will still think they have an epic team, and that they are the best!!  LOL
Big Ben came to play! His O line let him down but he really wanted to win! But came just short! Great game!
Why did the Vikings stop running the ball??They were killing the Steelers running it!
Despite trying to give the game away again, the Vikings pulled it out! Guess they changed their mind and decided to win it.
AREA UNSOLVED: Streets of the community ... ...... ......... Book
Imagine if the browns would given the best back in the league, Nicholas Jamal chubb, the rock more than 16 times. Haha. Stefanski needs to give avp the play calling duties.
Ppl say Ben need to retire  the problem is not Ben if your defense let a guy run 225 yard in a game it not Ben,the o line-out productive Claypool needs group up
Tomlin gotta go
great game great finish a have step less they don't force that out.
What a good game😎
Wel the steelers are losing every way possible now. Neither team is any good.
Do you guys still have game with Lions?
Dalvin Cook is a monster i hate that he always got a injury every season. Vikings offense is explosive when he’s on the field!
Jefferson could have had like 5 TDs this game if cousins could throw an accurate ball.
Anyone else have an insane number of ads while watching this
Mike Tomlin is literally the dumbest man walking the sidelines in the NFL. HIs inability to navigate his way through problems that require no more than the application of third grade math is depressing.
Can’t really blame Kirk for these 2 picks. Osborn tripped over a defender and JJ just forgot his hands at home
Need more than a yard? Go toward Bashaud. If your offense is reelin’, focus on Breeland.
Awesome game
Wow
Damn Ben, it may be time to retire.
Vikings suck, Pittsburgh suck. THEY ALL SUCK!
Those purple and yellow jerseys are doooope
damn scripted comeback falls short
This was two poor teams playing against each other.
15:00 Almost better than Odell
That was definitely a push off
cook had all the right ingredients
Claypool acting like a child out there all game. He’s making a lot of costly mistakes for his team.
I had to shut the volume down just so this wasn’t annoying because Joe buck calls a terrible game. He doesn’t know how to give a descriptive play by play.  Payton was right🤣🤣🤣
If Pittsburgh would play like they did in the 4th quarter the whole game they might win
I dont know if vikings shoul be pride of themselves about this victory… they could be happy but man how could you play like this in the second half and only get 10 points
Sutton looking for a push off after hand fighting the receiver 40 yards down field
8:25 😮🔥
Breeland is a liability when he's playing AND when he's NOT playing!! Any fan can cover better than him.. JEESSSUUUUSS!! I seriously DO NOT understand why he is still on an NFL roster! Zimmer is so incompetent!
No screen plays no TE play no run play  wonder why we not winning. Come on call better plays
Good show:)
I don’t want to hear Ben is washed again
Steelers quarterback it's over, go on vacation. Vikings not that good like Dallas. That's why you came back. Vikings 6-5  that why.
Why are they throwing so much in the 4th Quarter?
Refs always helping the vikings out at home
No way. No questionable calls for the steelers and they lost?!!!
One viking know how to do is choke loat to the lion haha
I absolutely hate my team
Interesting matchup, considering that both these middling teams ran afoul of the cellar-dwelling Lions. Both must have anticipated a win against Detroit. The Steelers got a tie, while the Vikings gave the Lions their first win since Hector was a pup.
Joe Buck is the worst. Please relocate him to the Steven A. Smith show so we can skip both of them at the same time
Just like watching the real game an ad every 2 minutes.
rest in piece DT you will never be forgotten
Ik we lost but god damn we missed them
Still shocked on demaryius Thomas. Heard it was a seizure while showering.
The Vikings in the 4th quarter realized that they were indeed the Vikings and had to make it a one score game
I really wish Ben would play at least one more year he's got lots of game left in him and is still one of the best in the league in my opinion when he has time to throw!
Me thinks the Steelers might need a new coach.  Tomlin has failed to impress over the last several years.
We can never finish off comebacks
I’ve seen people who are incredibly drunk have better situational awareness than Chase Claypool
Aww man imagine if the Vikings lost the game if we're in overtime? Coach Zimmer would probably be fired sooner than later for sure
Steelers fans are so laughable. Nothing makes me happier than seeing the Steelers lose. Especially this way. Chase and juju are the perfect fit for this team. Fit right in line with their SOFT coach. Mike t wants to be besties with these infants rather than discipline them. It makes me feel good.keep it up chase. You’ll eventually see yourself the way the rest of the world sees you. SOFT AF!!
10:11 how you know he's canadian
So tired of this Steelers team not showing up in the first half. Glad they got it together and gave themselves a chance but if they can do that for the entire game, they probably win. Seems like neither fan base is satisfied with this game lol
Reciever Int should be a stat. If the pass is thrown into the recievers catching zone and it bounces off the reciever into the defender's hands, that interception is on the RECIEVER not the QB.
Steelers looked atrocious
Stopped watching at 29-0,  had to come back to see how the fck the Steelers almost won this game.
Funny how those type of games happen during primetime. Like it’s scripted or something. NFL hires thugs and wife beaters.
vikings always trying to loose games
Thx Minnesota 😋🙏
Vikings should have took a cue from the Pats and ran it nonstop in the second half
Nice to see Minnesota beat Pittsburgh 38-29.
the end was so close
This game was so epic vikings were whooping steelers then steelers made good comeback but vikings won but both played pretty good
God, Troy is killer on commentary this year 😂
Big ben bruh
Not a Vikings fan but Jefferson is special. I like his swag. Glad the Giants and eagles slept on him hahaha
Down 29 to 7 they get interception an run down to end zone like fools to jump in front of the camera . man have times change . not about winning all about the camera.
This game makes me even more pissed with the ravens coaching and why was tj watt out?
I’m so glad I’m not a steeler fan watching this fat old quarterback…sack candy. My ex is a fan, enjoy honey…
Another one of those "well, my DFS lines are shot, Steelers hoodwinked me for the last time. I hate this game, I'm going to bed" kinda nights
claypool's out of control in my opinion you cant act like that in a football game, he should have been heading back to the huddle so fast
They left out the celebration by that idiot Claypool which took a lot of time off the clock for the Steelers while they were rushing up to spike it and stop the clock LOL
Claypool is in his second season and already starts to make problems. What is wrong with the recievers here in Pittsburgh?
Idk How the Vikings almost lost i mean they were up 26-0 and they only won by 8 seriously y'all almost chocked like the falcons always do.
Not surprised the Viking almost lost that game after being up 29-0. They are so mediocre.
Jefferson wasn't feeling it this game
The Vikings are the only team that can win and still piss their fans off
I really dislike osbourne, he isn’t good and he acts like he’s the best! He’s way to cocky! If he was good then he can be that way but he’s not!
As much as I dislike the Steelers as my dad (May he Rest In Peace) was a Bengals fan and I a Chiefs fan. I would love to see Trylon Burks get drafted by the Steelers. I live in Arkansas don’t like the Razorbacks but Burks was a beast and I think he would thrive in Pittsburg.
Utree and all of Yinzer Nation were being consumed by false hope, then Claypool snuffed it out.
Holy ads
Vikings got too comfortable so they took the foot off the gas
When your down 29 to 7, I don’t thinks it’s time to showboat.
Steelers vs Vikings: two teams that couldn’t win against the lions.
Lol 7-29 down and celebrating a interception in 3rd quarter 2 mins remaining  I don’t get nfl if I was the steeelers coach or any nfl coach and  saw that circus non of those players would be there next week
Guess I should not have gone to bed at half time. 🤣🤣
As a Vikings fan …. This didn’t feel like a win.
After watchin this game I think its time for the whole of Pittsburgh to retire
The Steelers tight end gotta make a play for his qb and make that catch at the end of game
Big Ben got busy!!! Just a bit too late. Took his old ass a while to warm up like a 78 Chevy in the cold.
8:23 next years madden animation that with break controllers
Cook should've had 200 yards rushing. The hell they passing the ball with a lead late in the game like that?
The Vikings are not playoff caliber.  A playoff caliber team wouldn’t have squandered a 29-0 lead and almost lost.  You better hope they don’t make the playoffs because they’re one and done.
The kickers this year are missing everything
Chase Claypool looks like he’d rather be in the ballet than the NFL
Steelers run D is below average.. But lets give the Vikings O-line some credit. They were solid!
Christ. That catch at roughly 15 minutes by Claypool. I'm doubtful about it, but I really, really hope that Claypool takes the route of Vernon Davis by maturing and fixing his bad personality and attitude as he grows in his career, because he is such a talent. He's shown flashes of being a good guy and a class act (i.e. helping up opposing players and being one of the first in comforting Freiermuth at the end) so maybe he'll improve and get there.
Great game 👌
The Best  & WOW play of the Day was Big Ben running for the 1st Down
ah Viking fans... dare ye not forget the playoff victory over the Saints a few years back.....take your heart pills and buck up   LOL
I hate Pittsburgh fans but Ngl I definitely was cheering the Steelers in the end
Calvin Cook would be the #1 RB in the league with a good team around him.
WOW!!!
Been the Steelers story all year, they can’t play a full 60 minutes. You can’t fall behind 29-0 and expect to comeback
look at ClayTool man, so uninspirational
Hey guys, I know we've been breaking off 20 yard runs all first half, but what if we just stopped running the ball in the second half....What could it hurt?
4:17 false start
I really be thinking zimmer be falling asleep at the 2nd half 😆 🤣
If my vikings are gonna win it has to be a one possession game
So what I don’t understand is that you have a running game but cannot use it because Cousins needs his TD’s and yards to win a game.
4:30 wouldve been odell pt 2
Harrison adding another highlight play to his HOF career. Made sure the vikings didn't allow that touchdown
Big Ben and the Steelers have put up 72 points in their last four 4th quarters. One of the clutches teams I’ve ever watched. It makes sense since Ben is top 3 all time in comebacks but SEVENTY TWO points in 4 quarters of football.
Alot of crazy things happening in these games since all of the betting.....
Devin Bush is just a bad football player right now.
Celebrating a TD has been lost to the celebration of a five yard play and being down 29 points. go team.
The Vikings almost lost in the most Vikings way possible.
Longtime Steelers fan here: Great game Vikes.  Go Steelers way to keep playing and never giving up. Ben is a great quarterback. Not washed up at all. Wouldn’t have came back without him.  God bless.
The Steelers are HORRIBLE…
Wow
Look at the Lion’s sons
Anybody remember when NOBODY ran on Pittsburgh.. Ya know when they had a unmoveable man in the middle.. I think his name was Casey Hampton... They've neglected the NT position long enough.. Time to get a block eater back in the middle of that D Line
The steelers could have won if they didn't wait so long to get serious.
The almost pulled a “Falcon (“……28-3)
Vikings come in at 5-7 and have not lost a game by more than 7 all season. That says a lot about Minnesota. Oh did I mention I'm not even a Vikings fan? Ok then.
Digging the Vike's uniform combo.
At least three end of game decisive plays: Lions in; Baltimore loses; Vikings win.
No 🤬🤬😡
as TROY correctly stated...STEELERS defense gives up huge yards on the ground....opponents know.... and often exploit that
The same idiot TE who just can’t make the big play , think fumble against Detroit which caused the tie🤮
Lions: "Look at these 2 garbage teams!"
The Refs just suck where should this end up?
Second half strategy wasn't just run the ball?
The NFL is the sport where you can't celebrate a good play! Lol
Vikings and RED BULL ENERGY DRINKS =WINS 2021
The 2019 Seahawks
I'm going to love Utrees comments on this one.
The vikings run game is on point 👉! That cook dude is a beast!
Chase clay pool made two great catches and about 3 big mistakes. He likely costed his team a chance by celebrating instead of giving the ball to be spiked smh! No self awareness
Cousins is like 3-32 tied or down into the 4th quarter.... its not totally on him but its not lost on me that something is very wrong with the viking front office, fire the GM who signed him... Cousins is the result of not knowing the game but just looking at the stats, stat rats you ruined the game
https://youtu.be/xmvSTIWGqgI
How do you spell doomed franchise? VIKINGS. This city will NEVER win a SB.
I feel like Steelers are the only professional team still using an elderly quarterback
Browns up 28-0 end of the first quarter Vikings up 29-0 during the third quarter
Claypool is wearing purple under that Steelers uniform!
Minnesota's secondary was straight garbage.  They let all the 50/50 balls through.
Damn Dalvin Cook had to drop 45 on me on final regular week for Fantasy
If the game was at pit we would of won
All I know is you can't blame this loss on Ben
Harrison Smith laid down a hit stick on that last play 😂
These highlights, highlights are hard to watch. That's the Steelers?
Harris Smith
Dude cut our kicker loose!! He sucks!!!
What an amazing game that was!
Pittsburgh no.18 just giving up on that INT 😒
great entertainment .week on week the nfl comes up trumps. who needs soccer?
Fun fact: the Browns are 3-0 against the NFC North and the Steelers are 1-2-1 against the NFC North
Khello wit two picks 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 #Sacramento 👑
Crazy game as a PACKER fan i know the talent Vikings have.
It is too stressful for me to watch a Vikings game! Wow!
A perfect display of both team's direction, as well as their character.. the Vikings have a scared "hold on, that's all we've got" mentally.. while the Steelers fight on regardless of injuries, or the score .. Ben is done, but his pride is there..
I thought we were about to Watch the Most Epic Comeback by Big Ben but it’s Whatever
Screw football only morons would watch this crap, I would never support these clowns. Die football die. SJ
Vikings offense is good today. Nice W
we suck balls!!!!
Pittsburgh Steelers vs Minnesota Vikings 2021 22 Joe buck troy aikman erin Andrews football nfl
Whata game ! MINN hurt Themselves all year long with questionable play calls by The O.C. They have the Best RB (DC-33) in 🏈, RUN against the weakest run D. in The NFL.
STEEEELERSSSSS WHATTTTT HAAAPPPENNDDDDDD!!!!!??????
I’m glad we won but I just don’t understand how we looked like the chiefs two seasons ago in the first half, but then looked like the Vikings in the second half but I will take it go Vikings
What game wow almost tied it.
Worst run d ive seen in a long time
Touchdown, Steelers, Washington! Joe is a man of few words when actually excited.
Zimmer would have definitely got the “Fire Nagy” treatment throughout Minnesota if the Steelers put that game into OT & won.
steelers fans,does that ending look familiar👨🏽‍🦯 (hint it happened during your last game)
Is this how Vikings fans live every week? Wow.
I don’t get it clearly Big Ben is able to make a fairly deep throw if he wants to we have seen them this game . I don’t feel like he takes enough though. It’s wierd to watch sure he lacks a bit of arm strength now. But he can get the bal 45 yards down the field still so I don’t get it
Been watching the Vikings for 30 years and I swear they’re the only team that can be up 30 points and still the game comes down to the last play lmao
4:17 how was tht not a false start😭
Is this sh*t rigged?
When you are losing or winning every game within a touchdown, it clearly shows that coaching is 100% the problem. We had the chance to be up 36-0 and instead we pass three times in a row in the end zone, after cook clearly showing that he was dominating the game.
Cam Sutton is a fkn bum money wasted
The Vikings the Huskers of the NFL except they have 3 more wins.
A W is a W
9:42 this is inappropriate.  How about save some of that energy running up the field to try and win the game. It’s 29-7 on the scoreboard you don’t need to do team defense photos in the end zone because you had one nice play on defense.
Great game s/o to the Vikings but on a serious note i want to offer my prayers and condolences to the family of Demarius Thomas. RIP DT you was a great receiver and proofed it in ‘13 that super bowl winning Denver Broncos team. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I'm so sick and tired at how little they use Washington this dude has not been allowed to grow or shine and now we're going to lose him. Absolutely stupid use of personnel. Put claypool ass in the slot. Start Washington on the out side. Best combat catcher we have.
Bye Tomlin. Got blown out again.
Kirkland cousins. Why tf did you stop going to Jefferson. This is why you cant be the vikings QBs .
I’m a Vikings fan & ima just ready for next year !! We got a solid team just fix coaching and our obvious needs
The only two teams in the NFL that didn't win against the lions face each other
RIP Demaryius Thomas
Steelers seriously picked it up in the third quarter but when your that far in the whole it’s almost impossible to get out. Bad game turned competitive gg
Packers still clinched the north even with this win 😆 🤣
Minnesota 🤡🤡🤡 ... Got the lead and stop playing ...SMFH
@16:23 Damn that hit by Harry THE HITMAN Smith.... he literally launched himself.
I love how Greg Joseph nearly lost them *another* game
Steelers 4th quarter is a team you don't want to mess with
Is it just me or is Joe Buck much more interesting this year?
Wow what a game that turned out to be, it might have ended with a Vikings win but not a very impressive win.they almost blew it just like last week against the Lions 😂😂😂
Dalvin really BEAT THAT DEFENSE UP like his ex girlfriend
If the Steelers used this 4th quarter offense all the time they would be a top 5 offense
If the steelers would play the hole game like they do in the 4th they would be unstoppable
Pittsburghs entire offensive line needs fired for offering Ben on a silver platter to Minnesotas defense all night. Simply embarrassing.
Bro we had a chance of clay pool didn’t celebrate
Was the worst I've seen a team implode and the worse I've seen Cousins play..their superstar receiver didnt look good either Bur Cousins has never been so bad...maybe he is checking out?
Wow I went to bed at halftime......missed all the fun     That last pass dam but Pittsburgh would have to get the 2pt. as well which is unlikely
Even when the vikings win, it still feels like a loss. Their secondary is God awful.
I need to see najee get outta Pittsburg he’s such a young running back and is having himself a season and it’s no secret that the Steelers are crumbling he should go to Tampa maybe Dallas or even the bills he’s gonna be great either way
the vikings dbs are horrible
Vikings should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.
Big ben gotta go …& plus viking fans ya still loss to the lions hahahah
If Zimmer loses that one "He gone!"
Even though my Raiders suck as usual…thank you Vikings for Carlson. We‘ll build this team from the kicker and punter up 😂
when the steelers lose everyone wins.
At least they tried 🤣🤣🤣
What game are they playing? I don't understand football anymore, that was a legit hit. Could you imagine if Jack Lambert was on the field nowadays?
Breeland needs to go
Only 1 QB in the NFL has 25 TDs and only 3 INTs. Cousins is having an MVP-like year. If it wasn't for the inept Vikings defense, they would be a Super Bowl contender
Vikings lost to the lions but beat the Steelers how does that work
PRIMETIME KURK COUSINS with win No. 2
Vikings are so ass😭😭
Steelers got what’s coming to them after all that talking bout beating the ravens. O line sucks and so does Big Ben!
what a game
Osborn definitely pushed off
Vikings at half: 23-0  Also Vikings: Why not let it be a very close game?
steelers got heart and very good WRs!
Cheated for the vikings ngl
The Steelers have once again embarrassed the nation. Gashed and sliced up by a running back with a hurt/dislocated shoulder for 200 plus yards rushing. Offense was putrid again, still can’t run block, still pass happy with a noodle arm lard ass for a QB. Kendrick Green #53 is a bust.
#11 pokes him in the face then gets shoved and called and is like "what I do" 🤣😂
So this is Pittsburgh when they don't have the refs in their pocket?
now im sorry for watching highlights instead of full game replay
Vikings have lost this exact game all year long. But for a what?... Triple covered hit job in the end zone, Steelers just needed to hold on to that catch and it would have went their way. Guaranteed. The Vikings soft ass plays every single game come third quarter. I'm convinced now it doesn't matter how big the lead is, they absolutely let off the gas as soon as quarter 3 comes around. Fire everyone but Cook, Thielen and Jefferson. No one else plays to win.
My boy cook cook them 🆙 real good 👍👍😁😁
Without the game changer TJ, it was a super close game. Vikings almost choked again.
Isn’t that a personal foul against the Vikings on the last play? Because Steelers got called for that earlier in the game. Or does the NFL have an agenda.
I went to bed at 29 - 0, woke up 2am to check the scores and had this uneasy feeling that Steelers staged a 2nd half comeback before seeing final score.
Rest In Peace Demarius thomas
Maybe one of these teams can make that female kicker from college the first female pro football player.
I respect the steelers fight this game but on the vikings side, they need to run the ball when they have a lead like they did
It does take all of us. Unfortunately folks who contribute are being weighed down by those who do not.
Ben needs to hang it up.
lmaoooo i went to sleep when it was like 29-0 . wtf happened 💀
8:45 Get dunked on loser, fire up those mock drafts steelers fans
Sheesh!!!  Barely!  I wasn't able to watch beyond the 1st quarter.  What is the deal with their 2nd half (late 4th qtr) defense?!!  Maybe they need more conditioning in practice so they're not gassed out by the 4th qtr.
Vikes once again almost snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory.
Claypool was stuck in a 'madden animation' when celebrating a first down with 20 seconds to go..... can't explain it otherwise
Why is the Steelers receiver core such cancer? Like the only one whose even likeable is dionte
NFL refs are the new WWF refs..... how do you call a personal foul/targeting the head on Fitzpatrick when he hit the Vikings WR forcing the ball loose in the endzone and NOT call it on the last play???? It's a carbon copy of the same exact play.  I'm not saying it's the right call but for f*#&@ sake call it consistently
Steelers suck so bad, they lost to the Vikings.
When you've been running against them all night you decide to throw in the 4th quarter
Steelers are bumbs
Claypool sabotaged the whole gam
Good Game Viks....I wish my Ravens would have beaten them Steelers.
Big Ben threaded that ball perfectly into Friermuth’s hands, sadly he couldn’t hold on.
We really need new corners this is really embarrassing
They was up big, how did Pitt come back and make it a game.
Vikings being Vikings.
how the f!@# you gonna come in the game over 500, come off a win against baltimore, and turn around and lose to team under 500?  I believe the steelers need to rebuild an offensive line AND PLEASE LET THIS SEASON END. BEN NEEDS TO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  congrats to the vikings THE STEELERS D IS OK BUT LEFT WIDE GAPS OPEN
Other than the valiant come back attempt helped by the Vikings easing things up, the Steelers are painful to watch in this game. So many parts need upgrade, possibly including coaching and playcalling. I don't see them contending until significant changes happen over the next few years.
Nah we had them idc if myth didn’t drop the pass we would’ve been good idc
I really actually feel for Big Ben after seeing this. Steelers O line can't even stop 4 with 6, or 5 with 7 - three times Ben got sacked in one of these situations by an untouched man.  Like, we all know his career is ending - but taking a hammering like this due to an absolutely incompetent O line, damn life isn't at all fair sometimes - and I get the feeling Ben is taking way too much of the heat for it - I firmly believe high school kids could do a better job than some of the steelers o-line right now. This is just dumb, heck I could do a better job and I'm almost as old as Brady and as small as Antonio Brown - but I'd still make a niqqa knock me down to get to my man, not just let him walk by - and I'm a multi sport low tier rep athlete in my nation so I do have some genuine insight into the competitiveness of it all and the requirement to fulfill ones duty no matter what.
Claypool is dating Jackson Mahomes and I'm not joking, my friend went to ND and saw it on his private snap story
Look at the score it was 29-0 and the Steelers score 29-7 and they came back to win smh?
Dang
I had Super Bowl 51 PTSD watching the 4th quarter of this game
Vikings
Bye- 👋- bye Ben! It's Ben fun! Time to hangup the cleats.
I turned this stinker off at the half. Can't believe it came down to the last play... but this is the Vikings, so the whole season has been like this.
That PI call was total BS
Everybody take a knee. In the words of our Steeler coach next man up, let’s go Steelers!
Yall didn't see this Crazy skills...💕 https://youtu.be/Za8OAtirkuo
Losing 29-7, dude get an interception and still run to the end zone to celebrate with his teammates. Generation screwed man. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ben is no TB. Sorry
Lmfao.. only vikings can blow a 29-0 lead n make it look close
Offense really looks different with Dalvin Cook on the field.
Can the NFL stop with these crap Unsportsmanlike conduct calls? Remember when the NFL had characters bigger than the league?
Steelers look helpless, if not for the Vikings playing zone and prevent they may not have scored at all.
The Vikings did not deserve that win. The Steelers played with amazing heart and did not give up when down by 29 points. That it seriously came down to the very last pass is just sick. All cred to the Steelers and their amazing receivers!
Wow this was a good good game
It's nice that the vikings try to keep fans in the edge by making it a single possession game every time. Keeps us very engaged
As a Ravens fan, just glad we have Justin Tucker.
Cook and Claypool both stole the show....  Vikings almost went into hibernation in the 3rd quarter, costing them deerly..
Dalvin cook is so good at football 😭
What an embarrassment the Steelers were Ben's got to retire he looks so slow
Should have played Mattison for my fantasy team :(
I love the vikings and im a Ravens fan. The last time a Vikings game wasnt decided by 1 score was week THREE What is up with this team?? Theyre so fun to watch! Way to go!
I’m not Mad We Lost But We Known To Comeback 2nd Quarter
It's almost like the second half of the game was fabricated by the NFL to be more entertaining...it just seems to perfect... ain't no damn was these games keep coming down to the last drive with about 2 minutes left of the clock! I can't bare to watch reality TV shows because it's so fake and staged... I'm getting a feeling that the NFL is fake and staged too!
STEELERS GONNA SOUPEUR BOUWL
Love playing soft coverage on the 2 minute drill after it clearly didn’t work last weekend.
Wow ben can still football
Clay-Pool is a selfish and idiotic player for his team. Then Witherspoon catches a pick and goes to celebrate in the end zone down by 20. This is one of the many reason Steelers are so bad right now
Elsewhere in Minnesota the wild have won 8 straight!!!
It would be nice of the steelers knew how to play football in the first half too.
Hmm that wasn't any good was it
najee harris is the best rookie out there
The Steelers intercept the ball down 29-7 at the end of the third quarter and the whole defense runs to the end zone to celebrate? You would think they were winning by 20.
Vikings almost gave it away but this was a thrilling game though.
15 minutes of highlights, 30 minutes of commercials. Just like an actual game...
Classic Steelers, score 0 points in the first have but score 21 in the 4th
And this doesn't erase that all time horrible loss to the lions 💯 but nice try 3rd Cousins ❌
Both these teams have have something in common, they both are embarrassing inconsistent 🤦🏿‍♂️
Stillers still going to the SUPA boel
I was crying in tears when bart got his head stuck in the toilet 😭 🚽
Rothlisberger has been trash for at least 10 years now, he’s getting sacked by the Vikings now lol
Went 1:03 before I hit double unskippable ads… wtf
Typical Steelers try in the 4th give no effort in the first 3 qrts
Steelers tied with the lions Vikings lost against the lions Just saying
Ben is getting old and tired.
A little too late comeback by the Steelers. Great defense in the first half with a great offense up to the finish. Dalvin Cook!!!  Congrats Vikings!
Look up Tartaria/Basque Country.SOS.
Every steeler loss is a win.  Go Ravens....
It's a 60 minute game, why does our D decide to call it a game after only 45? This whole season could be waaaaay different if we had just tightened up on that side of the ball in the late stages of the game. If we even squeak in to that last wild card spot I will be amazed and overjoyed with that. Zimmer still needs to be fired
Maybe you should have paid Watt more money that way you dont have anything left to invest in your offensive line
why do they celebrate an interception when they are 22 points down haha!
Wooow good Game
🤣🤣 my man dropped the ball in the end lls and did a push-up
I swear the taunting penalty calls are starting to make big plays boring
Minnesota should have put up 50 points in this game. The Pittsburgh Steelers is trash this season...yes, I'm a Ravens fan LOL
I damn near cut the game off in the second quarter, i woulda been right but guylee im glad i didn't!!
What a crazy game this turned out to be lol
Vikings are so confusing man
You gotta give Roethlisberger respect for almost turning this game around. When all hope seem lost the Steelers eventually found a way and almost turned it around! Not bad, old man 😅
I went to bed when it was 29-0. How did this game go to the final seconds is beyond me. Now I have to watch replays to see how the Steelers even got their points and made it into a game. SMH.
Steelers lookin rough out there, damn
Players practice there celebrations more than plays that will win them the game 💀
This goes to show you the type of WRs the Steelers have, with a mobile QB watch how dangerous that offense becomes.. with or without a o line cuz it don’t get no worse than what they playing with rn
Rothlsberger must go
First ab, then juju now claypool.. why every Steelers wr can’t handle themselves like professionals?? Lol Tomlin a h.o.f coach too so don’t tell me the cultures trash down there .. I need a real answer! Lol
Number 88 for the Pittsburgh Steelers ass for that drop...hit the bench
Vikings lose to Detroit, Steelers beat the Ravens, and Steelers give up 23 in the first half, another 13 in the second half and go down in Flames. Ben looked good enough in the 3-4 qtr.
Vikings vs. Referees Week 14
This team is horrific. 20+ points ahead with one quarter to go and you still damn near lost. Ha!
This game was a wrapt until that taunting call.... if I was his teammate, I would wanna fight him too. take the sack and move off the field.
Steelers forgot they were playing a game until the 4th quarter…. Again.
What a Play by Harrison Smith at the end
I dont get the NFL but then again. What I'm gonna say it want make since but then again it will. How a team beat a certain team then lose to the team that was beaten by the team they beat. Like for example  how the ravens beat Vikings but cant beat the Steelers for the past 3 years. But the Vikings can beat the Steelers for the past 2 years I dont get it. I never understood that but it's the NFL it's so much talent and skills so I'm assuming  that's why and of course the coaches going head to head knowing the other coach style of play.
Kirk Cousins was horrible on his throws. Over launching his receivers, under throwing it.  Most of these points came by runs that had nothing to do with him yet he records the win.  That’s BS right there.  Same thing with PATRIOTS LAST GAME. the guy threw (3) passes the entire game and won.
Wow Claypool really just costed them about 6 seconds.
Claypool a poor man’s dk metcalf
I dont understand how this happened. The 4rth quarter was a weird mix of vikings lack of discipline and Steelers will to not let go.
Football is so boring to watch anymore well it has been for the past 20 years this is the only tolerable way just watch a highlight every blue moon
Flagged Minkah for a clean hit on 17, then Freeimuth gets obliterated and no flag at the end. 🤦🏽 flag football.
Pittsburgh: 6-6 tied for last place  Steelers fan: if we could just have five quarters, then we could maybe win
Second half Vikes D made Ben look like hid old self. Just chuckin it up there. One PBU away from blowing the game...
Can't wait to play the vikqueens again on our turf where the refs won't overturn our touchdowns without conclusive proof. Go Pack Go. I hate the vikqueens more than the bears.
leading 23 points in half time but still almost chokes up in the 4th quarters nearly losing the game...
I’m so sick of UBER Eats with these damn commercials I can’t skip!!!
Steelers season is over I hope so out of the playoffs yes yes lol ha ha thank u Vikings for not screwing up  the 4th quarter lol ha ha
What in the WWE??? nfl wild for this one.
Fire claypool
As a Vikings fan, I was starting to root for the Steelers at the end there.
To the Vikings’ fan, did the Vikings look any different without Adam Thielen? I felt like JJ had a tougher time out there without his duo.
What an up and down season for Steelers.Miserable
Great game
Oh my, the Steelers run defense is trash…
Well at least the Steelers have the draft to look forward to next year.
Anyone else sick of seeing mahomes God dam sneaker commercial
Wow who would have thought the Steelers and ravens would lose to a dropped pass. Difference here was the ravens went for 2, and the Steelers were down by 8. That sucks for both teams I must admit. But at least the Vikings learned not to choke big games? 😅
Cousins has gotten a lotta flack for not winning big games, but I really think that he just needs a complete Viking team around him, and he'll be a Super Bowl worthy QB.  This from a Packer fan.
Damn good game
cause of the death : attach this clip
That's gonna be a classic game one day.
Good game!!!!
I’ve never seen that many sacks over roethlisberger that’s huge
15:01 That catch from Claypool was unbelievable.
Steelers are DEAD
Harrison Smith saved this from being a historic throw.
As an Ravens fan I approve this L from the Steelers.
At 4:00 - what/who is #34 keying that he overruns it so much to the inside instead of containing outside? Or is TJ wrong for shooting the gap instead of setting the edge/being the force player?
Perfect week for the Vikings, they pick up a win AND make their fans endure a loss.
Cook is mad underrated
Good ending. For doubting the comeback I had to give my Steelers 30 push ups
Vikings took the falcons place
What a %&*$@% team the Steelers are. They lack  heart,  talent,  and professionalism.  A complete embarrassment to this city.  Easily the worst Steelers team in 2 decades. They'll lose the rest of their games this season and finish 6-10-1, absolutely pathetic.    That game wasn't close,  Vikings humiliated and embarrassed them in all aspects of the game,  especially coaching. Tomlin has proven yet again that he has no common sense or football sense at all. Don't know why he gets such accolades,  the dude is not NFL caliber,  like these Steelers themselves,  he's a poseur and pretender.  The Vikings miscues and stupid penalties are the ONLY reason that game seems close at first glance. It wasnt. This Steelers team,  from coaching on down,  is absolutely devoid of anything remotely resembling professionalism.  The sooner this year ends,  Tomlin is finally fired,  and Ben retires,  the better!
Dionte Johnson Is nice, better than juju
Worst combo to listen to. Lifeless POS Aikman and Buck
Did Bud Grant blow the horn, didn't see any of this game. God bless him still going 🙏🏈
From an Australian  This taunting flag is total rubbish   You are ruining the sport
WOW WHAT A GAME
Brooooo. That last play. Straight up. Helmet to helmet. Should have been a flag.   These refs today blow. So hit and miss.
We Suck!!!!
Not even 5 minutes in...and already commercials! 🤦🏾‍♀️🥴😵‍💫👎
Only the vikings
Once again, the refs and luck keep the Stealers in a game more than they deserve.
How does a scientist freshen her breath?                 With experi-mints. 😬
Imagine if this game went into overtime!
D Cooks vision and speed is ridiculous
Vikings playing the first 3 quarters how the Ravens should’ve been playing last Sunday
That TD to Osborn, pretty good throw Kirk
Lol yall both suck.
How is it both kickers miss the extra point/field goals? It’s an indoor stadium!!! No wind factor…nothing! Ridiculous!!!
can someone enlighten me please? was Dalvin Cook was good, was the Viking O-Line so great or are The Steelers so bad against the run? thank you
NGL THE VIKINGS ARE KINDA ASS JUST FOR LETTING THEM GET THAT CLOSE SO SAD  🤡😅
Ben needs to lose some weight no bs. He's probably the heaviest QB I've ever seen. I guess that's why they call him "Big Ben."
Cook looked like an all-time great against this defense!
16:27 I think I"ve seen this before😂😂😂
How amazing is cousins?????!!!!🤯🤯
If Pittsburgh could only figure out how to play for 60 minutes instead of just 20.....
Am I the only one who thought, that the refs were a huge reason the Steelers got back in this game
I'm  glad to  see  my team  minnessota viking   winning   over   steelers            go viking
Minshew to Steelers next year.
Rothlesberger moves like an overweight 12 year old.💔🤯
I didn’t watch the second half!
The Vikings need a new coaching staff
Spanked them Steelers
I love that the Steelers lost this way. Gave their stupid fans hope, just to come up short and basically end their season 😂🤣   It's ok guys, you have the Pirates season to look forward to. It'll be a decade or more before your football team matters.
Dam. What a game
I see my boo Steelers stealing some run plays from bucs😂
I dont like your team getting blew out , you make a play and yaw doing a routine in the end zone, thats just crazy
Breeland needs to go
Rematch of Super Bowl IX...different results.
Steelers 1st half defence was slacker than 10 year old underwear
Big Ben is embarrassing at this stage. He's as mobile as a sack of potatoes. And they have the nerve to call some QBs athletes??? What a joke!
don't know why they went for two.
Watt would of been the factor in second half.  He stopped fighting
Have the Viking won or lost by more than 1 score yet?
Cousins overrated AF. Not even Top 15
The next Pittsburgh Dad episode should be good.
Neither a Steelers fan or a Vikings fan here, BUT, can we talk about how soft the NFL has become. I cannot stand some of the stupid flags called in the game, unnecessary unsportsmanlike conduct flags…it’s very annoying.
With a record of 5-7 and TD dancing WTF? What a pathetic selfish display!
Almost blowing a 29 point lead is vintage Vikings, a dropped pass away from probably the 2nd biggest comeback in history.
i don't know why they cut out the part where claypool took his sweet time celebrating, time that could've been spent on one more play.
What a game damn
Wow I didn't watch this game but like was NO ONE blocking for Ben? Like at all?
I hate spoiler thumbnails. Just show the team logos.
That wasn’t a push off?
Wow that was an incredible near-comeback by the stealers. The catches they made were unbelievable.
why did i pick the Vikings to support?! I'm Welsh and stupid would be the short answer
The way they hugged their tight end saying next game 💯💯💯
Yo Steelers!? When are ya gonna find another qb? Ben is due for a retirement.
#Skol
My take from this is Big Ben should have been let go instead of Brown and Bell. And Cousins is not a SB calibre QB.
Steelers offense is flat
Oh No Steelers suck again🏈😏
Got close, but they got the win at least. Redemption for last week
Vikings would have deserved to loose it. How can you be so damn dumm
King of sports
I went to bed early thinking this game was over.  BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIG mistake.
Roethlisberger could be the least athletic professional athlete!! Move slower big man!
Vikings, please beat Green Bay. I don't care if it's a one score game. Thank you.
Man that turned out to be one of the best games of the year especially when it always I'm happy when the Steelers lose then they beat us last week haha they six and six and one and we got to beat them next time we playing thanks Minnesota appreciate it
Knew it. Our fans are so toxic and got overconfident for nothing. A perfect trap game to lose. The Steeler way. Cant wait to fight for a top 5 pick for the years coming and being the bottom feeder of the AFC North. Brilliant.
Reminds me so much of the loss vs. Chargers. Much better final drive though. It's clear as day though...as has been all season, the issues with this 2021 rendition of the Steelers...their run defense is terrible and their OL is a mess.
Justin Jefferson is a superstar receiver.
In Steelers Fashion They Are Playing Down To There Competition Are U Fckn Kidding Me Now!!!!! - Some Angry Yinzer
I needed that thumbnail to be of Clay first down pose for trolling purposes. I doubt any Vikings fans would be salty about it.
Same old Steelers.....over the top celebration on an interception when down 29-7. Reminds me of the days Brady and the Pat's would be up 28 and the Steelers would have a super bowl celebration after a meaningless td. Does anyone on the Steelers ever look at the scoreboard?
Is everybody is too busy watching the vikings be the vikings to notice that the video is definitely sped up?
Just put these damn Vikings on prime time all the time. Even when they're leading 29-0, they still manage to win/lose by 1 possession. Absolutely, consistently insane!!
The Steelers love to fall too far behind of a game in the first half then play catch up. It's the story of their season. I'm glad they finally gave Witherspoon a hat it's only week 14. It's too much to ask to put in Anthony Miller that might help the offense too much
They need to get rid of that bum Roethlisberger
vikings have some sick fetish about having to have every game decided by single digits
RIP DT
Fantasy regert: Conklin. Gg.
3:58 why are so many safeties are reckless morons? the biggest hazard on the field is a safety crashing into one of his own players.🙄
As someone who didn't watch the game why did the Vikings abandon the run game Dalvin Cook looked unstoppable and averaging what looked like 10+ yards a carry. The fact that they decided to have Cousins throw the ball which nearly cost them the game is mind blogging! 🙎‍♂️
Good, steelers fans deserve nothing but bad things. Pittsburgh is a trash dump city that no one should be living in.
No helmet to helmet on the last play? Haven’t seen a close up replay but slowed down from this view it seems like the guy on the back side hits him with nothing but helmet straight to the face
It’s time to get rid of zimmer Vikings should have a way better record than this. And Cousins ion know I’ll give him 1 more year to get it right 😭
Ben need to retire
Vikings never disappoint another to their list of very entertaining game.
It’s scary how close this game was to that lions game 😂🤣
Sorry to say this but Big Ben needs to just retire and just call it a career already
In 4th steelers manage to go o and 28 that s terrifyng power of steelers. I bet other teams are watching this game saying.... dammmmn. Vikings and steelers played hell of game.
That was a good game
I will never forgive Dalvin cook for being a bum right up until I was eliminated from my fantasy playoffs.
I think primetime football is rigged sometimes lol
What happened to the Vikings in the 3rd quarter!?they got too cocky?
Taunting flags are very disrespectful to athletes.
Great game for Dalvin Cook and a bad game for Cousins way to many overthrows and 2 picks.
Chase Claypool's awareness rating: 📉📉📉📉📉
I started Cook at the last second over Clyde Edwards Elaire 👊
No more commercials?  Dang it
Mamma mia , what a game !!!🏈🔝
How long are the steelers gonna let Ben make them look bad? Swear he was sacked like 8 times in this game. Who ever chose Ben  to  be the starter this year is an idiot!!! If they bring Ben back next year they might has well forfeit they season. Cause they are not gonna get it done with him anymore.
Imagine tying a game against the worse team in the league AND losing to the team that lost to said worse team in the league.
Good I'm tired of the steelers coming back winning late
Wtf I thought they blew them out 😒
Good game lol 😂
Big Props to the NFL editing team, what a game!!
So. Many. Ads. In. These videos. As. If. The. NFL. Needs. More. Ad revenue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Farrrrrrrrk
Washedberger lol
Smart of Vikings to humiliate and fire Daniel Carlson.... NOT!  :-)
the pittsburgh offensive and defensive lines look terrible today. that said, the o line will always have its work cut out for it since ben is always just gonna receive it immobile from the gun.
now I see why they only won five games til tonight. Game management and play calling.
Fck the Steelers ! Good riddance!!! Take your towels and shove em up your assez biatches.  Your fans suck , your towels are g@y AF
talking about the stealers they impress me every game shhheeessshhs
Strong biceps small brain
I see the ghost of Blair Walsh was stinking up the place strong in the 1st quarter
It’s hard out here for a Vikings fan 😂. Sheesh that was so unnecessarily close.
For the love of God why do the Vikes kickers always ALWAYS suck?
i cant tell if this game was more the vikings remembering that theyre not allowed to have easy games or the steelers still forgetting how to play football until the 4th quarter
The Vikings have the worst corners in the league . They get beat every game really bad .
Surprised they didn't throw a flag on the last play
Vikings almost blew it again. Ridiculous 🙄
Down 29-7 Pitt interception let’s run 40 yards into the end zone for a selfie picture. Just play football FFS
Ok now is the time to replace all of our Vikings secondary except for maybe Harrison Smith.  If this game doesn't prove that the I don't know what will.
What is wrong this team I don’t understand every game is close they have yet to play a full game sucks to be a Vikings fan
'... here's an interception.'  thanks, joe buck, you lifeless jelly.  NFL deserves Gus Johnson and others like him.
Someone has got to be paying big bucks for the Vikings to keep floundering in the 2nd half. They had it locked up @ 29-0 and tried to give it away. Follow the money.
Last time I seen that many sacks I was at a Potatoe farm in Idaho - and the kicker i'm from the UK!
Great fun to watch!
Claypool might be the least intelligent player in this league
Steelers need a new mike lb
All those awesome Steelers catches. Its almost like the ball is never in a good place to catch. Hmmmm
I stopped watching the game at the half thinking it would be a blowout and it actually turned out to be a good game. Congrats to Cousins for winning on prime time 👍🏾
I swear to God the Vikings are the best team in the league to make you feel like you have the flu while watching them
Anyone watch Harrison Smith give his teammate cte at the end
Vikings refs on payroll or what -_-
They tried to lose it.
Steelers have lost the STANDARD.  This is an embarrassment!  Tomlin and the coaching staff have better change the culture in the locker room or move on!
Damn the Steelers run d is really that atrocious
How exciting was that?
Dalvin cook still got it
Why are the refs not human?
What a game
Looked like Breeland  took a swing first.
0:47  Hey #11, that loss is called Karma lmao
One second too long on the play clock and it is a penalty. A 30 second celebration for a score and no delay of game penalty. Come on, man!
That claypool catch was banana’s
I wonder if Vikings are cursed. They seems to always have above average roster year in year out and when it's clicking they're unstoppable. But somehow they always find a way to make it harder on themselves
Great game fr
The Vikings should be thankful for those three field goals they made in the first quarter. .They lose this game by a few points if it wasn’t for their kicker
Off topic but RIP to Demaryius Thomas
DC4 is the only reason I watch NFL. LOVE IT WHEN HE BALLS Wish Vikings had a mediocre QB though.
Too much hope is worse than despair. The only winnable games left for us are CLE & TEN. We are gonna miss the playoffs
Watt must've been hurt from the get go. He had no big push at all. Just like one or two plays he was on top of the QB, that's it.
These new taunting rules are absolute bs. I wanna see some emotion. It means something to these guys who work so hard to play at this level.
Great running game, Vikings.
Claypool really screwed up on two plays. Hurt the team so much.
Jesus, 16 minute video? Might as well post the whole game. Do it like the NBA, condense to 10 minutes.
Big Ben under throws almost every pass receivers just really elite and knows it
Cook is so fast
Rip DT
Vikings motto - NOT 'We fight till death' BUT 'We take the fight to death'
Leading by 29 in the 3rd and almost coughing it up 😂 only my Vikings can do it...
Guess they learned from Detroit last week about that coverage at the end of game smh.. but go vikes
Love how quick the boys come over to muth to show him some love. I’ll always love my Steelers.
Fryer guy needs to be benched….how you dropped that pass?!?!?
Literally 6 promo ads and they just started the 3rd quarter portion of the highlights lol credit to those who pay the premium and or wait out all the ads
NFL you are rediculous! How many ads you wanna feed me?!?
Thanks you AJ Hawk
Wow gud game Pit tried hard coming back like dat
Defense sucks ASS. Buts its still #SkolGang
Best game of the decade!
Freiermuuuuuuuuust catch the last pass of the game!
No matters how good or bad a QB is, no matters the playbook, no matters anything if you have no offensive line and you cannot make any good play for the all first half of the game
i can't decide which team is a bigger disaster... both teams managed 1 good half and 1 half of wtf-was-that... despite a hard fought battle, in the end, the steelers wanted it more than the vikings, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
Joe Buck is just terrible.  He ruins both baseball and football.
Greetings from South Gloucestershire in England. Well that was the most nervy watch ever. I cannot believe how they can absolutely trounce them in the first half and end up with this scoreline. Pittsburgh looked awful......Love the Vikes but they shave a few minutes of my life whenever I watch these highlights
It seems every game is close because Vikings get a lead they quit playing and basically hand every game to the other team. When they want to play they are awesome to watch.
That Harrison Smith hit at the last second in the 4th was phenomenal
Vikings making everygame be down to the wire
I think Dionte scores on his last catch if Claypool blocks
Cook runs like he is skating!!  It's actually beautiful to watch him run the ball.
Ben Roethlisberger was brilliant in the second half. The people who criticize him blow me away. He's one of the 10 best QBs I've ever seen.
The running game was amazing, but Zimmer decides he wants to switch to the passing game.   Result: Pittsburgh gets back into the game. Seriously, Zimmer needs to go.
Steelers tackle bag Number 7
If only the Steelers had a coach
TJ Watt should never claim to be the best defensive player in the NFL after getting manhandled by RBs and TE multiple times.
The comeback that wasn’t
playing madden against the CPU and your beating them so bad you start to get bored and you let them come back
That was a great game, power to the vikings 👏💪👌
craziness lol
You can't stand over someone and say something but you can run all the way down the field and lay down to celebrate? Great rules.
Would’ve won a lot of money if the saints couldve somehow won their division and they’ve just completely crapped the last couple games…didn’t put a lot up but would’ve won a lot I have others dw
Goodbye Ben last year should of been your farewell but they felt sorry for you. Now your jus to old cuz time to hang that jersey.. Steelers you are every game you got lucky not no mow hahahaha
That was a game!
And not even a replay of the final play? Geez! Are these clips selected by a bot?
Dalvin Cook......Dalvin Cook
Cousins is the definition of good stats but jus not a winner
Fell asleep when we fell behind 26-0. Glad we were able to scare em a bit. Play for pride. Proud of them for not laying down.
Great win...without dumb penalties and cousins ints would've buried the steelers
Why on earth did they feel the need to add a special graphic showing remaining timeouts when that information is already (and always) on the scoreboard?
Smith saved their ass lol
"Well we're getting 10+ yards per carry from Dalvin Cook. Better start passing to burn up some clock."  -  Vikings OC Klint Kubiak
If yall haven't noticed. The Vikings only win when their defense is in charge of the final moments
Vikings shld be so good I jus don't understand 🤔
Yeah, I like that.
The can't run backwards to get out of bounds. The game should have ended.
Minnesota Vikings Bring Them Horns Back
vikings are trash. they aint going nowhere
Gotta catch that ball tho big Ben put it right in there tough catch but it was catchable good game
That last ball Ben threw INTO TRIPLE COVERAGE was a thing of beauty. That's one you hang on to with your life. Even Freiermuth's teamates knew he was gonna feel bad letting that one go.
Down here in NC, we call the Panthers the, "Cardiac Cats". We sympathize with you Vikings. Keep Pounding!
That Vikings 2nd touchdown 😬😬😬….dat run was sickk
Claypool is such a child. Big Ben and Diontae need to scold him hard this next week.
Imagine having a line tht can block😆I wish… now my qb(Russ wils) going to the saints…
Even with this win, the Viking are only 6-7 and still out of the playoffs... and the games only get harder.
Spotted them too many points early
That was such a Good Game 🤩
gggeeeeezzz..those  '''kickers''...suck......HEY  MAN  YOU  HAVE  '''ONE''''   JOB....GET  IT  RIGHT...!!..
Lmao 🤣 wow no helmet to helmet on the last down 🤦🏾‍♂️ that was CLEARY a flag
Reporter : After leading 29-0, what happened? Vikings : Yes
That o-line is an insult to a HOF qb. Respect to Big Ben for lasting as long as he has. Shame on Pitt! A marquee franchise in the NFL
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}  ooooweeee....GREAT  GAME...!!
Kirk cousins sucks and they need a new coach they were running the ball and they should have kept running the ball instead of throwing like lunatics and Kirk cousins has got to go he stinks
Pittsburgh had no business coming back in this game I don't know what the heck Minnesota was doing and Kirk cousins sucks he'll never leave this team to super bowl they almost lost this game
The Lions are better than both these teams 😒
All these Vikings Db getting moss out here at 2nd half lol
Feel bad for Freiermuth at the the end, good effort mate. Good Game both teams👍
When are we going to get the PI rules adjusted? Because at this point wide outs aren't even trying to catch the ball they are just trying to get a PI call it's so boring when every play someone is crying for a flag.
Is this the most combined missed field goals in the nfl this season?
Why do the Steelers do this to me? After a huge win against the Ravens this past Sunday, they decided that was enough and did nothing until the 4th Quarter. At least I got Yinzer mode out of the way Last week. Speaking of Yinzer mode, congratulations to Urinatingtree on 500k subscribers and for getting me back into sports again.
Finally, a Thursday night game worth watching.  What a finish!
Lol number 20 got toasted on the td
Dumb coaching to go for two points at 20-29. First off, they didn't need it yet. Secondly, if you miss, which they did, they now need two scores. Kick the extra point, make it an 8 point game, worry about two if you score again.
Thank you vikings... Coming from a Ravens fan.
I love the look on Harrison Smith’s face.
We lost.  To the Vikings.  Who just lost to the Lions.  All I can really take away from the Steelers performance is that Claypool needs to calm down and play the game.  He had a good rookie year but should t be this problematic.
Can anyone explain why the Vikings didn't just run the ball at the 3rd & 8, 14:29, when they missed the pass? If they get the first down the clock runs down to the 2 minute warning and you (basically) guarantee a win. If they don't get a first down the clock still runs down to the 2 minute warning because the Steelers doesn't have a timeout.
The Steelers need to have a field day when free agency comes.
The more difficult the catch the higher the chance Diontae comes down with it....
Sloth-leisburger he really is moving like one
Rip to steelers playoffs hopes
Run game crazy for both teams. dalvin cook and najee harris tearing it up.
Dude… Vikings defense almost choked as hard as the falcons did in the super bowl. Who agrees with me?
lions are laughing right now
Why can't we just let Ben do his thing. The o is so much better that way. Oline sellin and d selling till the end
Bro I was there and literally everyone was throwing paper airplanes around for no reason
YouTube is going down hill so fast. Wanted to watch the end of the video and had to sit through 6 different Ads to get there. 6 adds to watch a minute long highlight. 2 before I could start the video, fast forwarded to the end and had to watch another 2, didn’t fast forward enough so I put it up a little bit more and had to watch another 2 ads. Advertisements are ruining media
Minnesota FINALLYYYYYY
ND and Pittsburgh Fan here.  Claypool needs to relax. He's really not that good yet. Got potential. But the way he acts isn't really making him look very worrying for the long run. Interested to see how he preforms without Ben
Vikings are incapable of not having a last second game.
When Cousins plays great, they lose. When Cousins plays like crap, they win.
Best first half Vikings played all season. 2nd half looked like Detroit.  Glad they got the W.
Big hit by Harrison 💪🏾
As a vikings fan I cant wait to see Pittsburgh dad video reation to this one. Gg vikings
Probably one of the craziest comebacks by any team since super bowl 51, only if they won though since Pittsburgh is my fav team
Referees were calling crap yellows. Just to make it a game.
If they lost a 29 point lead in the same fashion that they lost to the lions. Oh lord that would have been funny
On the episode of “Days of our Steelers”
always funny to see captain fat f*ck run
This season there might be a new record for most missed field goals.
Cook is the best running back in the league just on the wrong team!!
Announcer kept calling Eric Kendricks, Michael Kendricks. Like C’mon dude. Eric is better. Minus a ring.
Whoa, I'm honestly surprised that last play wasn't called targeting. Comes in flying head-first and makes clear and solid contact with the back of Friermuth's helmet.
Game Scores Vikingos touchdwn Edwin Noria Hernandez Texas live
One push off away
This is the most Vikings and Steelers game of all time
The amount of ads during this video is utterly recockulous
I will ALWAYS think it's Corny for a defense to run across the field for a celebration, when their team is still down by two or more possessions.
Kirk Cousins is lucky he was going against Old man Ben
Pittsburgh almost got em lol.....good game tho 💯
Just think if the steelers woulda played some defense in first 3 quarters or hell even had a decent o-line
Fire Zimmer
props to the vikings offensive line!
.  Oh wow... The Vikings managed not to blow it...
bruh the catches this game wtf. legit insane.
Kris Boyd gave up 29 points in the second half
To the  Steelers Defense,  you might want to work on stopping the run, just a suggestion
Using the horn after every first down is so unnecessary
Those Vikings remind me with Nebraska Cornhuskers … lost every game with one score, whether they played Minnesota or Ohio State or Michigan.
Harrison Smith was actually the MVP of the game tbh. Dalvin played superb, but the o-line played better and those holes were massive. Smith on defense is so pleasurable to watch, his coverage disguises. Credit Zimmer for calling the plays and inevitably teaching it to his defense, because the double-a gap disguises and the blitzes that came all game were nasty. Zimmer is such a great Defensive coach, its just too bad that a head coach has to coach 2 other sides of the ball...   Harrison Smith is such an underrated safety in the NFL and still is considered top 3. He's literally asked to do anything on defense and still overperform. Amazing.
“And the steelers are not dead yet” 😂😂
The Steelers need a non felon at QB
@10:12 Good on ya Claypool. I know people are hating on him but he's the main reason they stayed in the game. So many clutch plays.
Ben need some help out there
I'm so sick of the woke NFL.  "usportsmanlike conduct" for gesturing to the ground after making a great tackle, ffs.
Rich Eisen's "What's more likely", was Correct. Kurt threw the Pick, even though Ben did throw 3Td's
This was like watching a really good NFL team playing a crappy high school team. Was this the same Steelers that just beat the Ravens?
Ben's as washed as the run defense, that was pitiful.
WOW!! Congratulations, Vikings on the win!! However, great teamwork to the Steelers to come from behind.
Ridiculous that they stop running the ball when it was 29 to 0
Steelers offensive line was looking like the Falcons line today
PURPLE PEOPLE EATERS
So, youre in the lead by 4 scores and your running game absolutely dominates the opponent...and then you stop to run the ball? WTF is responsible for that playcalling...
"Silk Curtains"  instead of Steel Curtain
Minkah fitzpatrick wasting his talents with that “team” smh
Claypool is an arrogant player.
I’m just a fan of football and the last play there was illegal contact on the intended receiver look at about 6-7 yards out from the line of scrimmage
8:41 Incredibly soft let the man have fun
2 minutes left in the third still 29 -0. Then Steelers have to go length of field to maybe tie it up. Missed it by that much. Sorry chief
Big Ben's O-line Playing like they "Trying", to get him Killed
It got better.
Why have to be so hard?
This definitely won't make Mike Zimmer's seat any cooler. First a loss to the winless Lions and now this? The Vikings led 29 - 0 with 2 minutes left in the third quarter. How this became a close game is beyond me. Zimmer better buy Harrison Smith a drink after this one, because if he didn't separate Pat Freiermuth from the football on the last play of the game then we might be having a very different discussion right now. The Vikings did everything they could to lose this game, and they are very fortunate they didn't.
Good game
why the steelers never understand the game? u down 29-7 why would u celebrate that hard for an INT down 22…
This game was fixed
He dropped it 😑😑😑
Steelers OL left him there to die... LIKE, COME THE FK ON!!!
The Vikings know exactly how to give their fans a heart attack on the fourth quarter 🤣
9:52 questionable celebration being down by 22 🤔
Steeeeeeeelllllllleeeeeeerrrrrrsssss whaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttt haaaaaaaaaaaappppppppppppeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd?????!!!!!!!!
Troy Aikman......Joe Biden......lol
The Vikings would’ve never lived that down, if Pittsburgh came back and won
The 1st half is so heartbreaking 😢😢 what is just happening to Steelers? My god my ❤️😢😢
Justin Jefferson's TD celebration 🔥🔥🔥
Vikings almost got Goffed again
Harry the Hitman!! 😎👉🏾💨
Great game! Go Vikings!!
That steelers O-Line is terrible receivers are great , run game is getting there , ben is a good qb but that o line not giving him the time and protection he needs is why its his last year , last season we did a great job and had a good streak but you notice ben was getting rid of the ball quick to avoid the sack but teams caught on and the scheme was over great game tho guys
RIP DT. You'll be missed.
The last pass was right on the button.  The TE caught it, but got unloaded on by 3 guys.  Ouch.
Is NFL rigged? The way Steelers played in the first half is too bad to believe.
Steelers nearly turned this game around, they need better offensive guards for Roethlisberger. He got sacked way too many times.
THAT WAS A GREAT COME BACK GAME!!!
*As a Steelers Fan they do this to US EVERY WEEK!!! We should all file a class action lawsuit against this organization because I know they have shortened my lifespan by 20 years PERIOD LOL!!! This game along with the Chargers game has proven this team DOESN'T PLAY at 100% unless their backs are against the wall!!! And also EVERYTIME they have a BIG lead over an opponent they ALWAYS take their foot off the gas and STOP PLAYING to allow their opponent to comeback against them!!! If they ever wanted to do a study on heart attack VICTIMS all they have to do is find a RANDOM Steelers Fan and they would have all the information they EVER needed LOL!!!*
If Steelers won it, this would be an all time classic comeback! So close!!!!
Vikings don't make its easy on us man like I don't need this stress in my life as well
F***ing Refs once again trying to dictate the game.
SHITTSBURGH
Also, Canada's a dipshit, the offense was rolling in the passing game...comes out and does 3 runs in a row, and then they have to punt after the center goes deaf again.
Honestly, claypools catch has to be one of the best catches of the year
Steelers quarterback seems fat, tired and slow .
Losing to the 0-10-1 lions woke the Vikings up.
I just finished the first half.  Did the Steelers bring a defense?  Hope it gets better.
SO MANY DAMN COMMERCIALS
That Claypool catch though🔥🔥🔥
If Ben's O-line could keep him upright, and the D could stop the run... Well if my aunty had balls she'd be my uncle. 5 minutes more could have seen a different result. And is it just me or is this a terrible year for kickers?
7:12 this shouldn't have been a pick. The receiver put forth no effort at all and just watched it happen.
Gotta respect the Steelers for fighting back and didn't give up
steeler = still lose .
Crazy. Love the Steelers but mannnnnnnnnnnnnn
Vikings got away with this one. They allowed Steelers to get that close. Ben will always rely on those long passes to get pass interference, Always.
Wow, Muth knew he was gonna get lit up when he saw all three defensive backs
The refs started cheating at the end
only if the ravens played like this lol
Don't get your hopes up 👑 queens...you know my Packers will go deep into playoffs/Superbowl
Clay pool is such an idiot the 15 yarder early and his showboating late literally cost them a chance to win this game
Helluva game!  Mapletron is the real deal!  Cook was Cooking for the VikeS!  SKOL!
Claypool is a fool out there this game.
As usual, Vikings plays to lose. Cousin is very inconsistent... need better quarterback.
I'm a ravens fan  it's a good day when dumpster loses 😊
Vikings did everything they could to lose that game.
Every week the vikings try to maximize the confidence of the opponents by throwing multiple easy to read wr,te,RB, screen.
This week on Days of our Steelers.
It hasn’t been the easiest season to be a Steelers fan, but at least they’ve played in some of the most bizarre games of football I’ve ever seen
Vikings still covered.
What a close comeback 👀
That Claypool catch in the 4th was incredible
Joe buck is by far the worst commentator to ever do it. Show more emotion!!
Rip Demaryius Thomas  We'll all miss #33 of Denver
Joe buck is the most boring commentator. As a vikings fan he didn't even show no enthusiasm on both of Pittsburghs interceptions
Refs. Lol
Who is the head coach for Pittsburgh? If they are in a rebuilding stage. They might start with some discipline coaching. AB needed coaching, Ju Ju needs coaching, Clay pool needs coaching. Hell the coaches need coaching. I don’t understand what the Steelers are doing. They are crap.
Vikings will win the Super Bowl
As soon as the O-Line started blocking they took off, too bad that took almost 3 full quarters.
It's all scripted folks I've been a cheifs fan for a few years all you have to do is watch the dominance that they can establish in a game and then they go 3 and out a afew series can't even get a first down that's the move that the nfl installs to let the other team to get back in the game make it exciting prime time game can't have fans turning it off
Its not pretty. But Ben can still play.
Ravens would never
You couldn't of scripted a better game where the home team comes out on top. LOL!!
Worst win ever but who cares given the news  RIP DT
great game!
Long live football.
Good game
First half = Matt Canada's offense  Second half = Ben's offense..  Fire Matt Canada
Bengals fan here thanks for making this alot more stressful than it needed to be vikings. I hate both of these teams. I hated this game
As both a Steelers and Vikings fan, and someone who went to the game, it was a poor man's win for the Vikings. 5 sacks for the Vikes in the first half and 0 points given up, and then with 17 minutes to go started falling apart against a team without Joe Haden, TJ Watt for half the game, not even an average OL player, and Minkah having an off night. Cam Sutton looked like he should be on the practice squad guarding JJ all game, and on the CJ Osborn TD there was a slight pushoff, you could see his arm extend a bit and made Cam Sutton fall. Bad win for the Vikings, and somewhat of an encouraging loss for the Steelers, but the first half was a snoozefest for me being that the Steelers are my top team
Please bench Waffelsburger
F*** the penalty. This was a great takedown at 8:56. wrapped up his upper body and trapped the leg then pulled his weight down with the leg trapped. Phenomenal.
If I was a Vikings fan I’d be pissed about this. I got second hand frustration from these dudes doing everything they could to lose.
I dont know if its play calling or QB incompetence but Vikings game management sucks. QB doesnt have this team. Player body language speaking volumns.
Vikings tried so hard to give the steelers the win
Great Win Viking 🤘🏾😂 #BengalsNation 🧡🖤🐅
Surprize steelers!
Where's the personal foul on the last play? You know full well it would be one if it was the first play.
Crapool should and must be released after tonight's game. He wasted the entire team's effort for a win.
Ben looks so out of shape
Good game.
ben was slanging that ball sheesh
Is that Harris guy with the Steelers any kin to Franco?
Daing bro from the first to second TD, Cook ran as if losing no stamina haha
Ty for not giving up Steelers 💪 Congratulations Vikings. What an amazing game.
Just like playing madden 😂😂
Claypool was awesome catch od the year candidate
The steelers are Harris and a bunch of bums.
Can't blame this game on Ben like they always do.
Love how after the last play the Steelers teammates came over the right end who dropped the ball and showed him some love
We are providing the league with the most interesting games you have ever heard of im glad tonight was a win
Classic Vikings win
*Mike Tomlin is ALWAYS SAYING DON'T BLINK well Maybe YOU NEED TO BLINK so you can ACTUALLY SEE the SAME DAMN STEELERS TEAM we are watching!!! This TEAM has PROVEN they have the SKILLS WHEN THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY PLAY AT 100% PERIOD!!! But what EVERYONE THAT BLINKS is ACTUALLY SEEING is this TEAM DOESN'T PLAY AT 100% until their backs are against the wall PERIOD!!!*
steelers really got it within one score wow. if only they could score in the first half
Vikings Defense sucks ass
Everyone take a second and admire how smart it was of Mike Tomlin to call their 3 timeouts before the 2 minute warning at about 2:35
Calvin Dook is pretty good
He dropped that last pass but it shouldn't have been that close of a game.  Vikings did a great job of keeping the Steelers in the game.
To coin a phrase from Mike Tomlin just last week down by 9 29-20 going for 2 totally predictable 🤔😄😁😃😀😅😂🤣😎
Roethlisberger is a crazy good, great competitor.
These games on Sunday cant be better than what we just saw, what a game steeler fans y'all almost had it viking fans y'all almost blew it two weeks in a row
The nfl is sctipted
Gettin real tired of the over enthusiastic personal trainer though....
Announcer: They just get it away, for real. Me: Ben Roethlisberger snapped the football while the game clock was at 00 and no flag.  What happen to delay of game (#7)?
The 4th qtr was fun to watch
N F L  sorry   PORSCHE...... there's no SUBSTITUTE 🤔
Game of the century
AND the steel?
Vikequeen got lucky
That call on number 29 was weak as hell I am so sick of this bullshit that you can't even celebrate or throw a little shade at the opponent
I’m killing myself vro
WOW Steelers !! Where do you even start analyzing this one !!... Oh right ! How bout Gametime is 6:30 NOT 8:30 !!!  I HAVE NO WORDS.......multi million dollar salaries and they can t tell the Dadgum time !!! C'mon !!! Who s the HC of THIS HOT MESS !
My condolences for DAMARIUS THOMAS and family
Stop with the commercials. Not worth it.
The Vikings are potencially very good  but there seems to be something missing
Keep the highlights under 10 mins!!
Claypool acting like Juju
this game was over until the foolish taunting penalty
Pittsburgh played like sh*t. The defense was terrible and Ben was a disaster.
Those Steelers WRs were looking like Randy Moss out there. Incredible catches.
I'm digging the Mardi Gras colors
Pause at 10:21 🤦🏾‍♂️poster
As a steeler fan was an unbelievable game 😳 as a viking fan was a horrible game 😓
Innovative thinking by the Steelers to play the 1st half without an O-line. Not sure I would repeat it. On the plus side ;) they have almost perfected the Nylon Curtain defense.
This game almost took a horrible turn for the Vikings because of Boyd’s stupid taunting penalty
Dalvin Cook is backkk!!!
Chris Boyd is an idiot, dude acts like he's 15.
Cook ran through the Charmin Curtain with ease tonight.
Rip demaryius thomas 😥♥️
Worthlessburger at it again
again the vikings  show they are not a good  2nd  half team
Down 22 points, The Steelers get a pick, and they run all the way down to end zone to celebrate…. Down 22…  Idiots.
This was the most Vikingsy win of the season.
Steelers deserve the W. I'm not Steelers or Vikings fan but if steelers played a good Defense they would win the game easily.
Justin Jefferson reminds me of Odell Beckham same size and run style and speed.
Wow what a fight Pittsburg put up , that was a heck of a effort
Kirk is the best.  He's my MVP.
Glad the shitsbrugh lost
Investigate Kirk Cousins for point shaving the 4th quarter.  Awful interceptions.
Lots of flag they tried cheating and almost lost that’s sad LETS GO STEELERS🥶
Damn, I went upstairs to fix a sandwich at commercial break when it was 29-0 thinking the game was over. I came back 5 minutes later and it was 29-20! WTF!😳😂😂😂
Beware steelers dalvin cook is back
RIP Demaryius Thomas.
Scripted and fake as h%^ll. Geta clue peeps!
Steelers lost to a team who lost to Detroit
Why stop running the ball in the 2nd half???
Steelers are TRASH !!!
Awesome game. Steelers showed some true grit coming back from oblivion. Vikings had one helluva a first half.
It's just nice to see Ruthlessbooger lose
Why would you keep someone at qb that throws so many hospital passes, hes gonna get someone crippled
I'm still convinced that Mike Zimmer is trying to get fired.
Did his offensive line Any Given Sunday his ass
Man How did Minnesota almost blow that
Big Ben almost let me down. But he showed some heart. That’s all we ask for.
As a Steelers fan this hurts
0:56... let's see what happened directly before that, with the ref watching it happen.
This team is garbage without TJ Watt, they literally have not won 1 game when he isn't there
Lets see now: Vikings lost to a winless lions then beat a steelers team that beat the ravens.What the f*ck happened here?
Best team wide reciever play I have seen in a long time.. A whole team of aggressive highpoint stealing athletes, very pretty..
Good.  Ruthlessburger loses another one..
Shame, but I'm not surprised the Steelers managed to lose. If they played like they did in the second half they'd be a devastating opponent for everyone, but they consistently play down to their competition and seem to enjoy making dumb decisions.
steelers been in some of the craziest games this year lol
What a match 😍 I Love this Game ❤️🏈
Yes we won the game but it still sucks. They let the Steelers come back from a 29 - 0 My Vikings are still sorry 😥😒
Vikings were really upset when they lost to the Lions 😂
Tomlin doesn't respect the value of offensive and defensive lines.  You can't blame Ben when he is getting sacked 2 seconds after the snap four times in the first half.   Claypool is like DK Metcalf, you look at all of those measureables, but then they just don't show up for games.
The Steelers are really a bad football team,  they barely beat the Bears, even with some crooked officiating.  They tied the lowly Lions, another home game as was the Bears, and now losing at one point to the less than average Vikings, 29-0.  The NFC North really isn't very good either.
what a game
It's nice to see their tight end drop it from a Ravens fan yeehaw
This is why pat and the boys got 30 million fan duel going to make a billions and billions from us steelers dahhhhhhhn.
Cook is a beast
Big Ben has to go!!!!
I went to bed at 29-0. Amazed to see what happened after. Joe buck or Troy aikmen said it looked like the viking were going to let them down on close game but they didnt.
RIP Demariyus Thomas  May God rest his soul & bless his family
harris is a monster
I keep forgetting about Thursday night games unless the Buccaneers are playing
never seen so much sacks
this jus ah Game OF The AGES 🌎🙏🏽💯‼️    Harrison Smith IS REINFORCEMENT - I’ll make Ah Hit To Em ‼️🗣
Dalvin Cook is a monster
Dalvin Cook is so freaking good!!
Honestly thought the steelers would get the touchdown, but then fail the 2pt conversion.
Don't really like the steelers but I do love a good come back. Was really hoping they'd get it
Helluva game boys
Don’t get mad Vikings fans we just had to make it a one score game for the ratings. Never a doubt
They gotta get rid of that gay Viking horn huh!? That shits gotta go! Your already wearing purple, with a big blonde guys face as your logo lol. Idk maybe I’m wrong
I’m the beginning of the game I hear cook was coming back I was like 😐bcs I already knew he was gonna go crazy vs my Steelers I don’t know how to feel after this lost not mad or sad just wow claypool
The Vikings uniforms are slowly but surely looking like they're the Seahawks.
damn this game was crazy
Can joe buck and aikman retire from commenting?  They are so boring, I miss Gruden’s commentating over these boring cats.
good game สนุกมากๆ สุดยอดทั้ง2ทีม
Rip DT
I cant wait for UrinatingTree to talk about this game 😂
Dem colorways are fire
First off RIP  Demaryius Thomas , one of the best wide receivers in the NFL this hits home for me because I lost my uncle back in June and I feel it every day 🙏😢   Later for the NFL man   Hey yooooooooooooo like I said the NFL whack now my boys 6-6-1 what? 😄  Game goes from 29-0 to 36-28   That's some whackness right there   But yup though 💪STEELERS 💪 The NFL whack if they don't want my Steelers to win another super bowl then say that because yoooooooooooo... How we get blown out 29-0 in the first half and now it's 36-28?    # Whoever our new QUARTERBACK will be we will be winning a super bowl 🏈      - Steelers 🏈🖤💛  I like the Steelers, Akello Witherspoon is alright he made a decent interception Our defense  is still weak as hell 😄
hell of a comeback but i was glad to the steelers lost
Please,  get Ben off the field. I cam smell him from Australia.  Maybe time to get a new coach while your at it. As a Pittsburgh native,  this is embarrassing. It's not the Steelers way.
Unacceptable.
And they lost to the Lions....smdh
Let dalvin cook
Great game 👌👌
Tell me how we beat the ravens but lose to the Vikings.
Great game. I’m surprised there wasn’t more injuries because how big the hits were
Days of our Steelers.
Oh for God's sake, that early unnecessary roughness call was bullshit. Come on, these guys are human. Silly stupid refs.
Pittsburgh gave this game away
Lmao Claypool pretending like he was innocent
💥💥I kinda of feel sorry for viking fans this team always have to make their fans sweat at the end of the games for some weird reason.  Also I don't get the constant celebration when you're down double digits. The Vikings are up 29- 7 that defensive back for the Steelers gets the interception and he and his teammates run to the camera. it looks dumb you're down 29-7.  Also how the heck can you beat the Steelers but lose to the Lions the week prior LMAO
I remember when football players didn't do all these ridiculous celebrations after almost every single play. It looks like a bunch of elementary school kids out there, dancing around like clowns.
First half the Vikings  play to win and second half play not to lose. Congrats I guess?
I know damn well #88 the TE for Steelers got knocked out on the last play of the game and I know damn well he was confused at the end of the game as to what was going on
So I was not the only one who thought Pittsburgh would tie it at the end and the Vikes would choke away a 29-0 lead. It was very close.  Vikes are still not making the playoffs. Rams and Packers will be losses.
He pushed a lil but still Sutton gotta tighten up. We need to play Killebrew more on D, Witherspoon gotta take that to the crib like😴
Im halfway through the highlight n I gotta turn it off.
15:00 I thought he dropped it
Insane game. Wow.
What a game 💯*not the first half 😂
Vikings on a roll.
what I would have given to see this horrible team follow up that lions loss with an encore of blowing the biggest regular season lead in nfl history
Steelers didn't come to the game until the second half.
The best thing about watching this game on Amazon? No Joe Buck.
That's a heartbreaker! 😪
The fans have been let down for the last few years. Is it time for a BIG change? We haven't had a poor performance in the first half since 1955.
Cam Sutton is cheeks, all our DB's are cheeks
Love seeing big betty get sacked lmao
This fake fixed crap 💩 isn't worth watching 🖕👎
Don't you hate when pass-catchers try and juke-move a defender instead of just Running Through Them.  Jeez-Louise! lol  AFC Wildcard gon' be tight!
The worst win ive ever seen
I definitely wanted Minnesota to win as I really don't like the Steelers, but I gotta say, Najee Harris is amazing to watch. Guy's a fighter.
I'm a neutral fan, Vikings are so full of potential but wildly inconsistent, I'm not surprised at this. Minnesota could whip Tampa Bay on one week, and lose to Detroit the next week.
Haha AJ Hawk sucks just like Pat at betting, SUPERBOOST IS CURSED!!
The Steelers are an inconsistent sorry ass team lol
7:02 #18 Johnson should be benched/cut
This game was the most viking thing the vikings have ever Viking’d
More C - work from Tomlin.  Steelers neglected the QB position for the past 5 years and will again end up at a mid draft position hoping a QB falls into thier lap.  Tomlin and Rothlisburger have been fools gold over the years.  Can't wait for the long over due change.
Man, what was this game. Turned it off at 29-0, put it back n when it was 29-14 and I was like 'Ok, hold up".
Rest In Peace DT. You will forever be a legend
Dalvin cook a beast might be top 3 backs in the league easiky imagine if he was henry stature from titans 💀💀💀💀💀👀👀👀👀
Remember DT what a player 🙏🏾
Taunting isnt a problem .. giving 15 yards for words is
I don't remember extra points being missed as much as this year. Does Covid have something to do with this?
Steelers could easily have won 2 or 3 games more that they lost
Watching Ben scramble is like watching a toddler who barely knows how to walk run away from you
Steelers definitely need some DB’s, some line spots replaced and a new head coach. “He never had a losing season” no sh*t, if you coach a team that’s had a Super Bowl able roster every year a horrible coach wouldn't have a losing season. Big Ben after every lose seems like “oh well no big deal”.
Disappointed
That last hit by Harrison Smith proves he is still elite
R.I.P. Demaryius Thomas✊
Though I'm not a Steelers or Ben fan, the first half of this game flashed me back to something I don't want to happen to Ben.  That would be the classic 1964 photo of Y.A. Tittle (the Blood Picture).
That penalty shows what a no class fool Claypool is. Perfect fit for this lowlife team.
Why do the Vikings  always  seem to give us fans heart attacks  in crunch time im glad we won SKOL 💛💜
5:45 Ben gonna box this man if he see this replay 😂  How are you gonna miss your block completely, get your old ass QB destroyed, and then just walk away? 🤨
dalvin.
WHY 👏 IS 👏 DEVIN 👏 BUSH 👏 STILL 👏 ON 👏 THE 👏 FIELD 👏
What i don't get is how Fitz was called for a similar hit earlier in the game and then the old guy doesn't call it on the last play. NFL sucks.
Did anybody here watch UrinatingTree’s stream for this game?! It was gold
For nearly 3 quarters, they made everyone forget they were the Vikings Then came the 4th  "Surprise, it's still us! Did you honestly think we weren't gonna let it come down to the last play for once? You did, didn't you. Diddddntn't you!"
Claypool is an IDIOT 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Claypool is a beast.
I literally have nothing to say for this game 😶
Bow movie
Dalvin Cook is a beast.
*PLEASE VOTE!!! All Steelers Fans in favor of starting to watch Steelers games from now forward at the beginning of the 4th quarter to cut out the stress of the first 3 quarters VOTE THUMBS UP LOL!!!*
Big Ben has been the best  fade thrower his whole career
I don’t know how much money the NFL makes off YouTube commercials, but two sets of commercials in the first minute, never mind I’m out.
The Vikings almost gave it away
This is the kind of team the vikings should be... Despite the fourth quarter.Vikings have great talent at every level... It has to be zimmer and not a lot of defensive chemistry
That was one crazy game to watch. Talk all the smack on Claypool you want that DPI he still caught was incredible
In my opinion, NFL should make sure that Vikings make to the playoffs! I will definitely watch their games!
What's the name of that wind pokemon? He was ballin out tonight
This game really portrayed the Vikings season-- They have so much talent that they can dominate, but there coach is so bad that he causes them to start losing. But ultimately our roster is too talented and not even mike Zimmer can cause us us too lose at times. (but then once again he is so bad and makes us lose a lot of these games
fire
SKOL VIKINGS!!!
seems like the steelers can only do something when teams start to let up, be conservative, and try to run out the clock. the steelers are not good this year. they will go 8-8-1
We all know Vikings not finna make it cuz of how they play this game
in typical fashion, the Vikings try their best to lose. oh well, I'm sure they'll do better next week. this team is ridiculous.
Refs were awful this game lmao
A b*ttkicking turning into a heart attack inducing game for Viking fans. It turned out to be a fantastic game. 👏 👏 👏
That was a great comeback by the Steelers. Great play by Harrison Smith. I know he didn’t do much in the first half but kudos to Big Ben for fighting until the final second. This was easily the best prime time game this year.
No One: Claypool: 👈🏽(1st quarter) 👉🏽(4th quarter)
Joe buck is annoying af and he doesn't know what hea talking about 90% of the time surprised Troy doesn't reach over and smack him
Two weeks in a row my vims last second games smh
Im a Steelers fan it was 29-0 late 3 quarter I was like ima just turn of the tv I do but that was like I don’t got nun to do I’ll just turn it back on than Steelers also my made a comeback pretty good game tho
At 38 seconds the Vikings hit the ball out of the Steelers hands, ref ran down the field chasing the tumbling ball... That should have stopped the clock 🤬🤬
Ahkello Witherspoon with 2 INTS. Definitely need this vet
Cook pulled a Paul pierce for this game 😂 dude is a beast !
GG! We almost made the biggest point differential comeback in NFL History, that pat frietmuth “almost” Touchdown was so heartbreaking, this one’s sucks just as bad as the chargers one, can’t loose this game either especially when our season is on the line.  Only thing we can to is try to beat those titans next week.
Vikings: NOTHING can stop us from having a close game!
Rip demaryius Thomas he will be missed 🕊rest easy big bro
Dalvin Cook saw that Steelers's defense and made sure he played tonight lol
SKOL!! Fire Zimmer!
Vikings almost pulled a Falcons!  Also RIP Demariyus Thomas
RIP DT 🙏🙏🙏
Steelers: Ha, you lost to the Lions! Vikings: You picked the wrong day for that...
Bro claypool celebrating after that small catch cost us 2 plays 🤦🏾what makes it worse he scream at the center and only if Freimuth caught that ball 😢
Harris can't block and is not intelligent enought to read the defense to pick up an opponent to block
The Vikings don't deserve most of the wins they have this season. As a Vikings fan, I hope they don't make the playoffs this year so Zimmer and Kubiak can get the hell out of Minnesota. I think I can speak for the majority of Vikings fans when I say I'm pretty over the "playing not to lose" mentality and allowing these teams to get back in the game week after week.
Good game
Good game
I HOPE BEN COMES BACK
Sigh as a Vikings fan 😞 idk y put myself through the pain
2021 Cardiac Vikings
Chase Claypool really saved the Vikings there other then that this was one hell of a game
Chase claypool celebration while they need to spike it is so embarrassing and unprofessional
Wheres the clayool fumble??
Rip dt
I think Dalvin Cook should have rested his shoulder for one more week. -- From a Steelers fan
It's fascinating, it's almost as if Tomlin coaches the team to do absolutely nothing until they're down by 4 scores and then they give maximum effort.
Osborn pushed off but it was clean as hell lol definitely effective 😂
The refs had to help to tiktok team back into the game
this one hurt
Nice play Minnesota. I’m glad you shut down Pittsburgh. I hope you’ll step up and keep fighting. 💜💛💜💛
As a Browns fan, I took the Browns to the Super Bowl by the end of the game.
Me from Cle, me happy
minkah got flagged in the first for leading with the crown and on the final play, my boy harrison leads with the crown and his helmet actually makes contact with freiermuth and his own player#23's helmet, y the nfl who is the sponsor of this video is not showing that final play again, if it is a penalty on the first play it is still a penalty on the final play and it's not like they were letting them play, 26 flags were thrown(21 accepted) WHICH means there was a flag thrown on 19% of the plays so 1 and every 5 plays, and making the correct call there (doesn't decide the game) the steelers would have one down from the 1 and even if they make that, they need a 2 pointer to tie, so i'm just asking that the refs call the game kind of correctly bcuz that play was clear as day
Good Game. RIP Damaryius Thomas -- Had a seizure while driving and caused a car accident  You want to be theyre going to link to CTE.
Beautiful Game vikings
The Vikings are  the second or third best 6-7 team in the NFC depending on Sundays results.
Zimmerman is bad luck prove me wrong
A typical vikings game! Glad we got the win but still..  When will be better than average...
Even at 29-0 you knew the Vikings would take the game down to a last second play.
Zimmer needed to be fired as soon as they got those three touchdowns in FIVE DAMN MIMUTES 😂 How does this man have a job still? , losing 7 games by only a combined 28 points
Clay pool is a clown
Vikings almost lost this one
And I thought Jesse James suffered a terrible fate late in a football game playing with the Steelers. Sorry Pat 😞
PIT on FOX
Ben for OC when he retires.
This was a fat L for both teams 😂 no-one should be walking away from this with a good feeling. Poor 88 choked his moment away too
🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Steelers won last week by their opponent dropping it for a sure score and now they lose by dropping a sure score. How fast that came around.
Just like chargers game how do you score nothing and then out of no where score like 4 touchdowns in 5 minutes wtf!!!!!
RIP Demaryius Thomas
Damn this one hurt
LEST GOO MINNESOTA VIKINGS!!
the only bad thing about this win is that the front office will be convinced to keep zimmer for another year. that’s not gonna be good.
Greg Joseph is 🗑
The steel curtain is more like a shower curtain and extra point kicking in the whole NFL has gone to hell Maybe it's today's  shoes
Only the Steelers smh 😂
The Steelers are like letting your little brother play madden and then you take the controller in the 4th quarter
Breeland threw the first hit, he bumped him on the sideline after the tackle.
Damn AJ, Pat and the boys are going to be pissed tomorrow! I can’t wait to hear what they have to say
Fire Zimmer. Not even a Viking fans but it sucks seeing so much talent get wasted every year
"Teams that couldn't beat the Lions" Bowl
Wow the Steelers O-Line was asleep for the first 30 minutes.
This one will definitely make the cut to be a future NFL Throwback 'Craziest Endings' video. What a game.
And to think neither team beat the Lions
One minute in and the food delivery commercials start...
Berger and Tomlin need to retire.
Lets go
Just ridiculous that this came down to the final play.  The Vikings will never reach their true potential as long as Zimmer is coaching this team.  Kirk Cousins may not be the guy either but he's not going away until at least 2023.
7:52 How did this still get positive yards 😂
R.I.P. Demaryius Thomas 🙏🙏🙏
You guys got cooked
Vikes gave the Lions their 1st win of the season and now this....i hate being a Vikes fan.
Ben should retire.
Next week on Days of Our Steelers…
as a steelers fan this hurts bro
Big Ben had a phenomenal second half.  I don’t care if his career is going downhill because it’s these carry performances that still make him an elite quarterback.  I’m going to miss him when he’s gone.
Vikings remembered early in the 4th quarter they needed it to be a one score game.
Mike Zimmer is the new Rasputin Wayne Fontes
That’s it The Buccaneers are going to the super bowl
Would of been the biggest and best comeback ever to smh
As a Vikings fans, I'm just happy 29-0 didn't become the next 28-3. Don't like the Steelers, but respect for the heart they showed.
Gg as a Steelers fan
Poor Vikings. They tried so hard to give the win to the Steelers, and in the end they still failed.
*Ben needs to call the plays for the rest of the season !!!*
#77 at the 15:16 mark, gotta be one of the dumbest penalties ive ever seen plus he was a good 4 yards behind the play already falling down
this wouldve been 28-3 on a whole other level if the vikings lost.
Vikings fans are one of the few fanbases who can still end up getting mad even though they won. What did I just witness
As a vikings fan the vikings still suck
Cook is like, Stat That!
I'm in denial with Demaryius Thomas passing. Opened this comment section and that's the first thing i saw...why? :'(
I couldn’t tell who wanted to lose more lol
PITTSBURGH Steelers 28 vs 36 MINNESOTA Vikings
Man it’s hard to watch this sport these days
kudos to the Steelers for the insane 4th quarter comeback, but the vikings were just too good for them
This is the most Vikings game ever
Days of our Steelers: A Wasted Comeback
The fact that the Ravens couldn’t run it down their throats like the Vikings did just shows how far the Ravens run game has fallen
Rip Demaryius Thomas
"Life like a mist, appears for just a day, then dissappears tomorrow" RIP Demaryius Thomas🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Why can’t the Steelers play the first 3 quarters like they do in the 4th quarter
I HATE THE STEELERS but man they're always exciting to watch in the 4th quarter🔥 My Cardinals still number 1 in the league 💯
Vikings football player
Rest in Power Demaryius Thomas 🙏🏽
Final play, a TE you doesnt catch the ball. I've seen this on Sunday aswell. This time the steelers aren't lucky ones
Harrison Smith saved the day.
My Steelers have a lot of issues they need to address during the off-season.

How did I as a Bengal's fan go through the chest pain Viks fans go through almost every game? How dare you Vikings make me go through this? Ohh, maybe because I was really rooting for the Viks this game.
Ben really threw an absolute dime on that last play
*Even though the Steeler's put themselves in the position to lose this game you gotta love on the last play the NO CALL as Pat was being HELD by his ARM through his route by #55 before he dropped the ball in the endzone!!! Go back and look at the play from beginning to end!!!*
Vikings almost pulled a falcons 😂🤣😂😂
Everyone in the 3rd Qr: welp this games over!!  Vikings: How close can we make this game!?
15:50 Chase Claypool did a Madden celebration under 40 seconds with no timeouts 🥴
Good game Minnesota.
Kirk Cousins had a nice performance for the Vikings. Big Ben tried to rally to tie the game, but came up a little short.
RIP Demaryius Thomas, mans was only 33.
#Steelernation, I know I'm going to take a lot of heat for this, but I don't think we deserve to make the Playoffs! We've looked awful this season! Absolutely awful!
The Vikings deserve to lose
The Vikings were up 29-0 and allowed the Steelers to score 28 points in the end. Imagine if the Vikings would've lost this game. Mike Zimmer better be thanking the Vikings defense for keeping his job. Also, Dalvin Cook with 205 rushing yards is awesome.
Dalvin Cook destroyed our defense!!!
I can’t believe it what a game gg Steelers
Wow what a win… Now Fire Zimmer 😀
SKOL SKOL let’s go
RIP Demaryius Thomas. Phenomenal football player.
Greatest 4th quarter team in nfl history!! Unfortunately we couldn’t pull it off. Claypool is such a talent but he has 0 discipline. Unsportsmanlike conduct after a nice catch and celebrates when we have 0 timeouts. We prob could’ve had another chance at it if we get those seconds back. As great as the 4th was the 1st half was disgusting. And it may have cost us the season…
The Vikings coaching staff made adjustments all night long and the players were in their right positions on the field all night long including on the final drive and the final play of the game. Great win💯
And this is what happens when you don't show up until the 3rd quarter.
As The Vikings are not good under pressure their games are always the most entertaining ones .  Vikings are a good team they are just coached poorly . Fire Zimmer .
This highlight video would've been 9-10 minutes if the Vikings didn't almost choked the game 😂😂😂
When I left the live when it was 29-0:🥱 When I see the game ends up 36-28: 😳🤨🤣 Just a classic 2021 Vikings game🤭
Claypool during the 2 minutes drill :🤪👉
I watched the game then I get the Pats Falcons Super Bowl recommended to me. kinda ironic
UrinatingTree’s stream tonight was a legendary masterpiece.  Thank you Vikings. Sincerely, the much more injured purple team.
Thanks Steelers from a cardinals fan
When a 29 point lead isn’t considered safe
I should put my niece in for the Steelers Inside Linebackers...
hey on the bright side of things at least Vikings games are interesting
falcons watching this like: 😢
Not sure what to make of either team.  The Steelers tied the Lions and the Vikings lost to them.  I'm thinking that victory over the Ravens was a fluke by the Steelers.  Or maybe Lamar Jackson is really that bad.
Joe "pass is caught" Buck
After the second td the steelers shouldve went for 2. And that last Vikings TD was a push but as a defender you gotta finish the play regardless
2nd Half saved my fantasy team. I have Najee and Diontae😅
It’s incredible how Claypool makes a clutch play on 4th and 1 just to waste it by using 10 seconds to celebrate…   Also Rip Demaryius Thomas 🙏
Claypool has ZERO football IQ
Dalvin Cooks had a career day, 205yrds, 2TDs the dude was unstoppable
This game got me moister than an oyster.
Claypool locking down lolcow of the week 😤
DELVIN COOK WAS SURE COOKING THE STEELERS. 205 YARDS AND 2TDS 🏈 💯👏
Rip demaryius Thomas. DENVER LEGEND 💪✊
So are the Vikings going to start covering their fans therapy classes?
That was the most Vikings game I’ve ever seen. Go up 29-0, and then nearly choke it away.   Tomlin gonna rip Claypool a new one for that 0 awareness on the final drive.
Only the 2021 Vikings can almost blow a 29-0 lead. S/O Dalvin Cook and our o-line 240+ rushing yards and no sacks given up.
always remember Super Bowl IX
The fact that the steelers scored 28 points in 13 minutes just shows how great they can really be. I don't understand why we are always not playing until the second half. Momentum is a mentality game and it shows today. Also, discipline is another thing we need to work on. Chase with these taunting calls, and Muth has to be more disciplined with catching the ball. We have to do better against the Titans.
Big Ben: hey chase give the ball to the center after you catch the ball Chase Claypool: we don’t do that here fam we celebrate 🕺
"B-but, they almost blew a 29 point lead!"  - Salty Steelers fans
THE STALLERS ARE GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL!!!!!!!!!
RIP Demaryius Thomas
It’s simple math.  Lions defeated the Vikings. Lions and Steelers tied. Vikings defeated the Steelers.  This means neither Lions or Vikings are the worst team in the NFL.
6–TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION PITTSBURGH STEELERS HEARTBROKEN 💔 😭 IN MINNEAPOLIS 16:19
Dalvin Cook literally walked in dropped retro bowl stats for no reason💀
This game is like going on a roller coaster. It leads you to wild emotions.
This might go unnoticed but I’m an Up & Coming Artist Worth The Listen 🗣🔥👂
*As a Steelers Fan they do this to US EVERY WEEK!!! We should all file a class action lawsuit against this organization because I know they have shortened my lifespan by 20 years PERIOD LOL!!! This game along with the Chargers game has proven this team DOESN'T PLAY at 100% unless their backs are against the wall!!! And also EVERYTIME they have a BIG lead over an opponent they ALWAYS take their foot off the gas and STOP PLAYING to allow their opponent to comeback against them!!! If they ever wanted to do a study on heart attack VICTIMS all they have to do is find a RANDOM Steelers Fan and they would have all the information they EVER needed LOL!!!*
Claypool has to work on his situational awareness. Why are you celebrating a catch with no timeouts and with a running clock??
The Vikings were up 29-0 in the 2nd half, but yet they were choking it up and allowed Pittsburgh to make a comeback out of it and made a game of it. Zimmer got away with one here
R.I.P Demaryius 🙏
I have a question. Do the Steelers naturally pick toxic players, or are they trained? I mean AB, Ju Ju, now Chase. It's absurd.
No one can say that Ben is washed after this game. Yes he has no mobility but he proved once again that his arm talent and football iq are still elite!
Vikings giving their fans heart attacks like usually
Steelers played in two games that can be considered Game Of The Year worthy...maybe more.
Steelers fans feeling that pain us ravens fan felt last week
Ultimate woman respecter Big Ben has got to get his act to together if the Steelers have a chance at the playoffs!
NFC North lowkey owns the Steelers
The Vikings are determined to have every game they play come down to the wire.   Honestly, I'm just glad I'm not a fan.
I wonder how many people turned the game off in the 3rd quarter?
Brasillll
With how this game went to the 4th, falcons fans were hoping this was the night that that a 29 point lead would be choked
THANK YOU VIKINGS  -BRONCOS FAN
Vikings: Fiorentina!  Steelers: Arsenal!
This was the most Vikings way to end a game
First
R.I.P Demaryius Thomas! 🙏❤️
