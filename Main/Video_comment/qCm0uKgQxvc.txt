Yo its so clear that this comantator is a Liverpool fan because he was screaming when Liverpool scored but when Real Madrid scored he didn't get excited at all and actually he sounded disappointed and sad and annoyed and not impressed at all smh he is so obvious about cheering for Liverpool lol

Kroos on bench still with Ascenio and ceballos wow
How is Modric so fast?
Wow, how the fudge did liverpool let that happen?
Liverpool played terrible for an EPL team who made the top four. Especially since they were at home.
I would’ve preferred to keep benzema for another season over getting mbappe
Came back after Madrid vs Dortmund 5:2

Can get over the unreal composure of Benzema in the last goal. What a striker! What a legend! Absolutely world class.
Such a weird game this
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Who’s watching this in 2024 ❤🎉.. halaMadrid

Bro the fact that Real Madrid cooked Liverpool
allisons worst game to date
Bro MODRIC is goated!
VINI SINGLEHANDEDLY EQUALIZED WOWOWOWOWOW
So obvious who the announcers were rooting for
Still haven’t seen Salah get his revenge
This would end up being Klopps last UCL game at Anfield lol 🤣
Ancelotti chewing gum 0-2 down so calmly 😂  Legend
Seems like match fixing.
Is this the last time Nunez scored?
Mís blancos 😍🥰😍🥰😍
I never been happier seeing Liverpool getting pumped at Anfield like this
Anfield supposedly the hardest place to play in. The fans the atmosphere lololol. Real Madrid don’t care about that shieet.
The only team to win at Anfield on 2023.
Errors on both sides defensively across the pitch because of how fast the game was end to end. We saw some great and some not-so-great from both sides.
this made Jude Bellingham go to Madrid and reject Liverpool 💀
An@lfield. Loudspeaker merchants 😂😂😂
you guys don’t realize how fast time is flying
wElComE tO aNFieLd lol
6:28 😮‍💨🥶
9:16
9:13
Consist
Madrid fan’s are such meat riders
Yo Madrid fans we have fallen off but you guy’s too 😂😂😂
Liverpools dad
Why did you run away?
Why Every Real Madrid goal seemed like a FIFA goal celebration. 😂  Benzema for tha 5th was insane 🔥
The eyebrow rase 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Vini scores on his own keeper
At this point people thought Madrid were winning the UCL and then came Man City, the rest is history 😅
Anfield Funeral 😊
Liverpool were embarrassing  Real brilliant
Goalkeeper screaming stop him took me out 😂💀
Modrid and Benzema proved age is just a number
the english commentators so "gracious" and "upper lip stiff" at 2:0.but then...again...lol...is like just Real Madrid by itself can take on the entire premier league.
Liverpool are out of the champions legue Chelsea are out of the championship league Napoli Are Out of the championship’s league only clubs left are  baryen Man city and Real Madrid and Milan. Hala Madrid changurro 🤍🤍🤍
Bro Real Madrid is way to powerful AKA The Best club
I hate it how these commentators just lose all enthusiasm when Real Madrid do anything.  Hey commentators, your English bias is showing
You can hear the Spanish commentators 🤣🤣
Liverpool got confidence lol
Cool
This is still too funny 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey guys I’m from the year 15229 and salah is still alive but hasn’t got his revenge against real madrid
Everyone sleeps on Vini Jr
As a Liverpool fan these two games were heartbreaking. Up 2-0 in 15 minutes, and they don't score another goal for another 2 hours and 45 minutes of playing. Literally watching real Madrid score 7 in a row ffs man
gk on drugs
Liverpool vs. this real team is just a mismatch. They literally own Liverpool at this point.
BRO I LOVE VINI JR HES MY IDOL AND THIS GAME HE PLAYED SO WELLL❤❤🎉🎉
720p really????
😃👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽🥅
P
cool game
Second Real goal is clearly fake.
What's a weak defense! Real Madrid
FIX FIX FIX FAKE
Modric causally just destroying sons of a generation after his for Real Madrid at 37 years old… is GOAT talk
Fulham can beat Real but the only problem they bribe uefa officials & referees.
Lol I can’t help but keep watching RM’s third goal on repeat. The way Militao sneaks inside the box before appearing out of nowhere and scoring catches every Liverpool player by surprise.
Real Madrid …ss whopper of Liverpool
Real Madrid is the killer of English teams. Real Madrid is the remedy to Liverpool 😂😂😂😂. Always gets whooped by Madrid. They are kneeled in front of Real Madrid 😂😂
I just don't think that this is a fair result against a farmer's league
Liverpool # 4 is such a bad soccer player.
What a comeback by Real! Doing that in an away game is just incredible! Imagine what will happen in Leg 2!
Madrid is your daddy 😂
0:27  he's 37 years of age and nobody has told him.jajajaja.lol.
Poor Jurgen just can’t catch a break with Real Madrid.
4-0 incoming 😈😈😈
As man united fan, this is so satisfying ❤️
Liverpool thought the had it 2-0 up 😅
Don’t mind me, I’m just a Manchester United fan watching this to make me feel better after losing 7-0 😢😭
Modric is just built different
I love listening to the English commentators half hearted comments when non-English teams score 😂
Liverpool don't talk come down realmadrid win to us 😩
Real Madrid vs liverpool are the two best teams in the world in 2023
real madrid doing real madrid things
Liverpool will score 4 in Madrid, but, but, but, Madrid will score 3. With the current defense, Liverpool has zero chance. Less than zero chance with that defense.
That Liverpool goal was classic!
Liverpool choked smh
Once modric leaves noone can replace him.
Ronaldo who?
These commentators made the goals sound boring and it made it worse that the crowd was not ok loud
If this commentator calls the UCL final I’m gonna cry
No pressure from Liverpool lol, Real Madrid destroyed their mental.
🛸🦪
It's 2023 still shooting with a fucking potato.  Watch some premier league
Bajcetic didn’t want no part of Benzema lol
KARIM THE DREAM!💎
Courtois is terrible with his legs.
That 1st goal !~
꿀잼 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Moric so talented with passing at 5th goal. so talented passing
Darwin Nunez Scored😲
People finally understanding why Modric is a deserved Ballon d'Or winner and one of the best to ever play the game.
2-0 Liverpool  Ancelotti - 🤨
garbagr madrid. paying the ref
If king Karim played final….W.C 22🤔..!
When Ancelloti start chewing  gum the boys know what to do .😁😁
Wtf is Jurgen Klopp Clapping for the other team
Way2go Real. Keep flying high.
UEFA is bashing the idea of Super League, while 4th place team in Germany can play in the champions league directly, but Croatian or Turkish or many other national champions has to play playoffs to qualify. Because of the coefficient thingy. How's that not elite?
Liverpool were almost as bad as Madrid were good. The defending on the third goal sums up where these clubs are.
Follow me for new news 📰😎 and you will know about it 😎
Wth is Alisson doing
Hasta el minuto 20 todo marchaba de maravilla para los Anti Madridistas.
That #4 van der bird only looks
We are asking for donations to lift Liverpool's performance. We miss Diaz, thiago, etc
Liverpool for a second thought they were going to win this match! 🤣
Gomez what a player
When skill meets luck.
Hala .adrid
alisson goalkeeper of the brazilian national team 🤡🤡
Benzema beat Gomez in the last goal! Gomez sleeps too much he has to go or move him up and Alexander too mid field they suck at defence
🤣 How did Liverpool manage to get here?
literally ANYONE: *scores first against Madrid*  Madrid: So you have chosen death
Moh Salah stays consistently selfish 🙄
Aja !!!  Aja!!!  Como si fuera tan fácil derrotar al Real Madrid !!    Liverpool son muy buenos , están pasando por un mal momento pero son grandes jugadores!!! Pero el Madrid es el Madrid !!  Se esfuerza con todo !! Vamos Real Madrid carajo !! Ha por todo
It is going to be quite difficult not to pick Real Madrid to win their record setting and unbelievable record of winning their 15th Champions League Silver Trophy after destroying Liverpool at their own home at Anfield 5-2. More than likely the best soccer team in the world, Real Madrid, will lift this silver trophy after they win it all in Istanbul on June 10th, 2023. The next best record is AC Milan with just 7. HALA MADRID
Deja vu vibe
It’s impressive Carlo Ancelotti is still coaching and excelling after all these years. Most of his contemporaries are either no where to seen or not doing any better. Nice Spalletti is also doing well with Napoli.😊
I made it a tradition to watch last year Madrid’s run once a month. So far I rewatched this game 5 times I hope another great championship run for Madrid time will tell
I feel for that young man Banjetic (probably spelled that wrong) I watched the game and he was playing good football, watching again he did make a few mistakes, but I liked how he played he’s going to be so good he had chemistry with Alexander Arnold I noticed, maybe more defense work but hopefully next meeting Liverpool can do better. Real Madrid just stays powering through 😅
13:00 Valverde and Modrić
Vinicio jr. 2 goles 2 asistencia
Sala should’ve passed it to nunez when it was 11 minutes in the match smh.. not sure if it would make a difference tho
You could tell how bias the commentators were lol 😂. Their voices changed when Madrid started scoring.
Lukita Lukita, damn so many glorious & beautiful Memories, so many Champions League Trophies!! As Real fan I say we have to built a statue for this Legend!! One of the Greatest Complete Midfielders ever!!! 😢🏆🥇
sex
Modric and Benzema are right behind messi and Ronaldo in this generation in my opinion
Bro, Liverpool fans have to be furious with bajcetic! The last two goals by benzema he had no effort and I’m sure Klopp noticed it. I mean the kid just stood there and watched while benzema decided to score. I mean it was already bad enough getting torched by 38 year old modric, but to not keep running to prevent that last goal was horrific effort by the young man. Learning experience I guess you can say!
The worst sell in football history was by Liverpool last season. Selling Mane for the singular reason that he is too black. You don't have to agree for it to be true. Hope they learn their lesson.
Fabulous game Real Madrid deserve this excellent game to win
Amazing game!
Beautiful
The second goal its not fair that should not be a goal
Vini Jr. is simply world class!   Best on the pitch!
I want you to know that God loves you and He offers you eternal life with Him. First you must realize that God created everything including mankind. But there is a separation between us and God because of sin (sin is disobeying God). So because of sin God sees us as guilty and worthy of his Holy judgement and punishment which is a place called Hell. But we don't have to go there or stand guilty before God because He offers us eternal life through our faith in the Gospel. The Gospel is what God did to redeem mankind to Himself. God reconciled us through Jesus Christ who is the only perfect sacrifice to satisfy God's judgement and wrath against mankind. The Gospel: God sent His Son Jesus Christ who is God to die on the cross for our sins. Through faith in His blood to cleanse us from our sins we receive remission. And through faith in the fact that Father God resurrected Him from the dead we have His righteousness imputed to us. If you believe this congratulations, you have received the Holy Spirit and are sealed for the day of redemption. You can read Romans Chapter 1 through 6 to find out more about this and Ephesians 1:13 and Ephesians 2:8-9 are great verses as well.  The plan of salvation is simple and its a free gift but the free gift won't do you any good unless you receive it
I’m a Barcelona fan but it must be nice to be a Real Madrid fan, down 2 hits Liverpool with 5 at home with their best player, Barcelona up 1 can’t beat ManU in the Euro league
Clown show of a game, Liverpool made an aging RM look “world class, universe class” which is complete bullshite - sick of teams rolling over for RM every year!
Real Madrid players are not selfish; that's why they always win the important games.
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” —John 3:16 Jesus Christ and God love you all!❤✝
Bro can we appreciate how Modric just ran through the midfield like it was nothing😂 very underrated
World class performance from Madrid.
if you pay close attention, you can hear the spanish commentators each time madrid scored
Did anyone else think that was Godfrey the comedian on the thumbnail?
The level of professional excellence l, and simultaneous agony of British (Britain, England-raised) narrators while RM pulls such a comeback ❤❤❤❤. That’s the standard of professionalism all narrators should achieve.
Modric? More like Magic, good work from Liverpool but it was not to be.
This is your reminder that all your sinful ways are nothing compare to the the love, freedom, and eternal life you can receive from God and no matter how much you think it’s to late to be forgiven remember that as long as you try your best to fallow Jesus and repent you will be forgiven and God will carry you on the right path
trash mo salah
lets go real madrid
Why doesn't Liverpool sacrifice their body to defend their goal?. Because, is it they are professional soccer players?
L coutois
Nunez  had a cool  goal
Is this  commentator a liverpool fan? sounded like he wanted to cry. Wheres the energy? boring
Just real madrid is better
The world cup disgusting me couple months and finally i could enjoy the real football again.
I'm confused because I see Darwin Nuñez arm extended out which would be offside...if TAA kept vini jr's goal in the final onside because his foot was stretch out wouldn't the same concept work with nuñez extended arm?
People saying Allison is the best goalkeeper in the premier league  but look at his performance today he made big errors and didn’t save easy shots he is way to overrated
Real Madrid are Altime comeback kings
Whenever I see Joe Gomez on the starting card. I know the result immediately. Nothing against him, just needs to be a sub
When I seen Liverpool’s midfield I knew we were gonna win 😭😂
Liverpool tuvo muy mala suerte. Real Madrid tiene muy buena puntería
1st goal by Nunez was fire.
Hey everyone out there on this list I have new music out there for all Lo-Fi chill laid-back people
Man zone marking on the free kick was just a horrible decision lol. That was way too easy for Militao, he just walks up unmarked… literally not one player moved.
Liverpool vs Real Madrid is always fun for a Real Madrid Fan will Liverpool ever beat them?
MODRIC
What a comeback!!!
Liverpool's players lack skills in accuracy and quick decision making!
watching this game cured my ED
Why is 14:34 - 15:34 even in this highlight reel?
Demolished 🐖
Anfield will never forget this Real Madrid performance.
Loserpool will always be Real Madrid’s Bitch 😂
Modric cruise for the 5th goal was just unbelievable and even the pass from vinicius to benzema in between the two defender us just a proof of Vinicius’s quality and importance. His game has matured a lot. Well done
No way vardrid not using black magic, they are not good but they get so lucky every match. Barcelona knows how to handle their magic and fucked them 4-0.
Modric the Maestro, Hala Madrid! I like Liverpool but man was it fun to see them get demolished by the Spanish giants
Anchelotti is the coldest manager hands down bro didn’t react when Madrid went 3-2 up, he knew alreadt
In la Liga mx the GOAL will be off sides !!!
Great to see the Barcelona’s bitc...s! they’re taking revenge of 0-4 vs Barca!
Amazing
Benzima last goal, Salah will definitely missed that one
Sad that there is no way liverpool is going to win 😞
I see a lot of potential in that  kid named luka modric.
I noticed that Real Madrid and Barca play very similar to the Spain national team lol..little touch passes and patience that eventually leads to hard shots with space
I’d Rather Walk Alone
ASI ASI ASI GANA MADRID
are madrid twopeating?
Klopps face with his fake teeth after every goal is a thing a beauty 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am just imagining if Real Madrid had signed Ronaldo 😢😢
Thank you god!!! Thank you father!!! 💀
Commentator is definitely a Liverpool fan 💀
Liverpool is such a great team, it kills me to see them waste a 2-0 lead
everybody wang chung tonight
Ha haaaaa eat shit Liverpool
In my opinion this goes down as a classic
Every fK*ing goal gomez involved. Same thing happened in PL with brighton match. No chemistry with other teammates.
once you see ancelotti do the 🤨 it’s over 2:55
Emma's watching "10:35" on Pop Hits on Fuse TV - Emma
This one shook me up to my core!   I am simply hurt that my team got dogged like that !
I'm a man united fan. But man that was a impressive goal by Darwin.
These damn commentators are horrible, English commentators think they are a podcast. So bad 😂 Spanish its where its at
12:50 it will be so hard to replace modric for Real Madrid
Strange goals. Fascinating game. What a compilation of odd goals. But goals still.
When they check modric dna the results comeback that he’s half lion
Well, That is the difference between a good team and mediocre one. Lol
my god we need a midfielder
Wow Nunez actually scored
I don’t think Liverpool should feel bad about this loss. That Madrid team was on point
just want to let ya know that God loves you all, we have to turn from sin and repent before it’s too late, John 14:6 says “I’m the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me”🙏🏽🤍
It was worth faking a dr appointment so I can leave work to watch this game 🥹
The ghost of Karius lives on
That's Real Madrid:The 👑 of Champion's.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Liverpool overrated anyway 😴 Madrid jus wants it more.
Liverpool players thinking they’re gonna win Carletto: 🤨
I’m a Liverpool fan, but god TAA defending is horrendous
Boring
To see Asensio smile like that after how the season started is incredible!
La verdad que Klopp necesita dos centrales buenos y un medio campo bueno siempre se pierde por errores de los centrales
imagine going to a game and singing YNWA ! id pay 10k for that !!
give us 1080p please
So tired of watching these "elite" goalkeepers think they can control the ball in their box as if pressure isn't immediate.  Of course it is!  I would be furious at either of these keepers if I were a teammate.  Absolutely unacceptable play.  No more taking this as if it's OK.  Who is encouraging this sort of play?  It's awful.    Keepers should just blast the ball in ANY questionable situation and let the field players do what they do best.
Wow! Liverpool was awful. It was one of those era ending matches. This Liverpool team is finished
Jurgen too stubborn to play defensive or at least not balls to the wall blitz after going up 2-0. A team should never ever lose when up 2-0. The refusal to change tactics and settle in is brutal. Players can't keep up the first 15 minutes. No team can play like that.
That may have been one of the stupidest games I’ve ever seen
Wonder how the girl at 2:51 felt after the game😂🤣
Its always Gomez. Too slow to late or on the wrong spot.
Look at Fabinho 12:47, he just gave away the ball and he doesn’t even chase Modrić, no hustle whatsoeverrrrrrr. Wowwww.
Vin jr just reading that play to make the second goal shows the veteran in him.. straight beast 💪💪💯👍   And I don't even like rm
Amazing game! Phenomenal performance with Vinicius, Benzema and Modric!
Loris Karius the best, no doubt about that .. Right! The whole world talk what happened to Loris Karius in UEFA champions league 2018. Yes, something too bad happen and everybody knows that. A concussion by the bad guy, Sergio Ramos. Right? So Loris Karius is justified. ...................................................... What about Alisson and T. Courtois!? Someone will explain to me, please? No concussion, nothing!!! Will the whole world now talk and keeping talking about Courtois and Alison, and will they replaced? ........ Shame what's going on in this world!!!      What  about Alisson and T. Courtois!? Can someone explain to me, please?
Poor excuse of a league, premier league is only 1 team now.  Sad. Liverpool plays with no heart
When are we going to realize that Joe Gomez is absolutely terrible?   I wouldn’t let that man walk my dog because he would probably find a way to screw it up. He is probably the worst defender we have on the squad currently. I could probably find one of the high school kids a coach to do better.
That’s what u get for mistreating mane
Salad is so selfish 2:00 should have been a pass for Nunez
...and we're still playing young guys over Firmino in games where we need experience. Guess we don't learn from our mistakes. Completely outplayed. We should not have traded Mane.
Asi Gana Madrid ❤
Hard to believe many of these players getting paid millions and yet most suck. I wish I had some guidance too become one
I regret never seeing much of real Madrid's game play they just get the best out of their players
No one is the whole Liverpool team knows how to tackle? 12:48 . This is rubbish.
If this was in the prem, the ref and VAR would have found a way to bail Liverpool out
English league farmers league
Funny how both Alison and courtious made a mistake
liverpool is overrated
gomes made me regret the decision not to pursue a footbal career in Premier League. What a shame. He has remarks in 3 goals, changed the game imho
This reminds me Inter Schalke 2-5. With beautiful opening goal of host team.
The 3rd goal is some of the worst set piece defending I’ve ever seen
Players just slipping all around the field 😅
Which one is better- peanut M and Ms or regular chocolate covered peanuts?
VINICIUS GOAT
Real Marid shredded Liverpool into pieces 🫤
RM doing wild things after going down 2 goals. Vinicius is just a mad lad.
Did you know that after the 5th Real Madrid goal a spanish commentator said “Well, this proves it, god is from Madrid” 😂💀
The comeback was so crazy
Jesus is lord
This is RM everyone forgets.
Liverpool fell at Anfield like Hazard’s career at Real Madrid. Both nightmares.
Mo Salah is washed
El Liverpool algunos jugadores no tienen vergüenza deportiva
That's tha fattest L that i ever scene
Increíble tantos errores defensivos,el Liverpool tiene que cambiar la defensa completamente y los contenciones son un colador casi todo pasa
those 2 goals, Madrid put on an absolute masterclass.
this video should be titled ucl round of 16 leg 1 and 2, cause it is over.
I was wondering why Liverpool lost. Joe Gomez was defending lol the fucking worst defender ever to play the game
The fact that a 38 year old Luka Modric out runs a 18 year old Fabinho is beyond me.
The maturity of Real's squad to go 2-0 down and tear them apart like that is incredible. Many other teams would lose their cool
Modric doesn't age? That acceleration for a 37 year old dude is amazing!
Our defending has been horrible this season. I don't see that strong back line from before. We need new center back pairings for next season. That's the only way Liverpool will be back.
what on earth has happened to Joe Gomez?
Alright because of the mistake by Courtois i think De Bruyne’s ex will go back to De Bruyne or go with someone else
Salah being stingy on the ball is the downfall
Ancheloty el mejor de todos los técnicos del mundo
Swear Allison does that a lot.
why was there so much slipping this game
amazing match!
Commentator definitely sounds like a Liverpool fan imo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Meee Production 😊😊🤟✌️
https://youtu.be/oOTn_5cmtLk
What's up everybody I'll marijuana a new upcoming Lo-Fi freestyle rapper check out my chill music🍃🖤💨💀🤟✌️
So Luca Modric better than everyone in the premier league at age 37?… nice! 👍🏼
Jesus Christ loves you ❤
come to Jesus he can save you
Imperial Real Madrid strike again!
That pisses me off when the goalie (Courtois) doesn't grab the ball like he should have done instead of fu&%# around, that's how you get a stupid goal! Luckily, Real Madrid managed to reverse the situation!
Why does that Madrid goal seem intentional by Allison? You can't tell me a keeper like him made such an error in such a game.
They say that to this day, Salah still seeks his revenge
I could watch this over and over again
💯  greatest things...
why do goalies look so bad at just clearing the ball, been seeing it more and more, my god they know they have no one behind them if they mess around right??? Why do goalies feel like they have time to just do whatever with the ball.
Salah should learn how to be a team player from Vinicius Jr.
In Spanish television when broadcasting a football game, there's a saying that goes "dos a zero es un marcador engañoso" (two to zero is a foolish score) and this is the reason why
This is the most boring commentary I have ever heard. I almost forgot I was watching football
Bono is light years better than Courtois
Real Madrid our owners so far ✍🏾
It all started when mane was sold and they brought all those second level player like Nunez , Gomez , Diaz
As an Everton fan, I absolutely love this lmao
these commentators are so bad
Liverpool is White 🤍🤍🤍
Amazing match, ¡¡¡hala Madrid!!!
I think it's time to get rid of Gomez and Fab they're pretty useless
How did Liverpool fuck that up lol
I love it ❣❣❣❣❣ #johnnyx100
😇❣️🤞
Too much standing around from Liverpool, just looks like they think someone will do there job and is just lazy. Real Madrid wanted it more.
five unanswered goals at home!!!11
Of course Madrid won, they're well rested from their league. The premier league is far more demanding and challenging.
Joe Gomez, nabi kieta, james milner, alex chamberlain, joel matip, fabinho, thiago, arthur melo, please just sell
Darwin is a beast
liverpool destroyed
Father vs child
Madrid is something else in the champions league
Who else gets vibes as if benzema would of participated in final vs argentina. We would of had different 2022 world cup champions🧐
The entire Liverpool defensive squad has been infected by the Macguire flu virus.
LIVERPOOL SUCKS, why are they even letting premier teams participate all of them suck ass
The score line is fair I think.
HALA MADRID
What an embarrassment
"He's 37 but they forgot to tell him about it" lol
Liverpool is terrible without the great Sadio Mane
commentary is dreadful
Liverpool have been very bad this season
0:42 Gakpo???😂
How does Madrid win in the champions league like that when Barca crush them in la liga
Thank you  CBS !!!!
how does a team fall apart this quickly lmao
Liverpool is the shadow of what it was, they were already defeated by 1st half
Unbelievable amount of misfortune in this game 🙉
nice 1st goal from Darwin but dude plays like an idiot
El Real Madrid sigue comprando a los porteros de Liverpool?
Imagine if away goals were still a thing 😲😲😲
Premiere League is a Farmers League
Jesus Christ is King 👑   Pierced for OUR transgressions  Died for US
I don’t see anyone better to bit Vinny this guy fly
Greatest UEFA club of all time!! 🔥   #HALAMADRID ‼️
Can real madrid end their trophy drought? 😘😄😃
Can’t wait to see the 6-5
If Benzema was healthy for the world cup, him and Mbappe would've absolutely destroyed. Their chemistry when they play together (with griezman too) is amazing to watch
Real on fire man! Modric should be tested for doping; that blistering power @ 37 I am amazed.
That last goal just had me smiling from ear to ear as an RM fan. Benzema, current Balon D'or best player in the world hitting it into the side netting with his weak foot, stemming from an accurate pass between two defenders from Vini who is growing into the most dangerous player on the pitch, which came from a pass and run from old man Modric who continues to show he's one of if not the best mid in the world. Absolute class all around in the play. Their chemistry is so unique
Stupid, defendant from Liverpool.
what an amazingly bizzaro game
i feel so bad for klopp bro 💀
Love when the commentators’ team is losing
Vini’s second goal is similar to Benzema’s goal in the 2018 final against Liverpool 👀
Wow Vini just stepping up and dicing through the defense to take away Liverpool's momentum is huge. He's gaining confidence, love to see it.
What's up with everyone slipping everywhere! Anfield c'mon boys!
3:07 “From the sublime in Paris to the ridiculous in Anfield” buddy sure ate his words by the end of the match 🤣
Why does everyone sleep on real madrid ? Like come on they repeating again itsbthe easiest money you can make this season even with correct score
If Benzema was not injured in the Qatar WC, France would have won the world cup for sure.
Go team
2-0 Liverpool winning  *Ancelotti:* 🤨  2-5 Real Madrid winning  *Ancelotti:* 🤨
Trent can’t mark
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.   I'd like to share if you're interested, just reply and I can send you the link.  May Jesus Bless you!
Just passing by to say: Hala Madrid
this game was crazy
Liverpool defensive like is figureable.
Hey KLOP.  Time to update your defensive lines.  They are not aggressive and become lazy instantly the moment you guys have a lead goal.  De Javu all over again and again
Madrid stays paying the refs, you casuals wouldn’t understand 🤦‍♂️👎👎
Liverpool took a big L when they sold off Sadio Mane 🤷‍♂️
As a United fan, I know I should be revelling in this result but I can't help but feel a bit bad for Liverpool and their supporters. Klopp looked like he was going to dominate England for years to come, but Liverpool feel like they're headed for what United's been going through the past decade.
👌🌹❤️❤️❤️🌹👌
Early departure for Liverpool fans 😂😂😂. What a come back by RM
as a Man U fan I’ve watched this like 5 times 😂
Liverpool fans, did your season start today?
UCL Real Madrid is the easiest money maker in history. I wait for them to go down, place a bet that they'll win, then cash out after 90 minutes with a victory for my club and $500 lol
Over the hills and far away!!
Anfield is always quiet 😂
Possibly two of the best goalkeepers in the world right now, making stupid mistakes, what a sight lmao
All praise from Madrid fans, but as soon as they start doing bad they are the first ones to sh*t on their team. Ole!
Dead commentators
People of looking at stats in the future will be saying oh Modric was not that good
Commentators showed ZERO enthusiasm for any of Real Madrid's 5 goals
Commentator is biased towards Liverpool
gomez is the mcguire of Liverpool. He's gotta go.
Never ever put martin tyler in real Madrid games. Hes bias af and boring af
vini best in the world right now
So the one time Nunez finally stole the spotlight at Anfield, that’s when Liverpool got beat down? 😂😂
The errors from both the keepers were horrifying. Courtois should've just punted it away, mean whilst Allison should've passed the ball away from Vinicius. Overall great performance from RM but hopefully Courtois' morale doesn't get negatively affected because of this.
Underrated performance by modric 🫡
lol 11:20 liverpool 7 players in the box and 3 madrid players just pass around them
Good highlights. Hey everyone, make sure you watch the videos on my channel also
My team get beat down 😢
Real Madrid making it their personal goal to disprove the “premier league is the best league” allegations 😂
HOLY SH*T!!!! I spit my coffee out when I saw that first goal from Nunez and Salah!!! OH MY GOD!!! That has to be one of the DIRTIEST goals I've seen in a long time! WOW that was CRAZY!!! That HAS to be Goal of the Year! Too bad Liverpool fell apart later on.   And the saddest part is that almost all of RM's goals were pathetic! Only the header and the last goal were decent. All of their goals were easily preventable and should never have happened if Liverpool was playing sound defense. It wasn't a case of RM playing amazing and creating amazing goals, as it was Liverpool just falling apart defensively and playing HORRIBLEY! Which seems to be an unfortunately common occurrence for them lately.   The team defense, and the actual defense are just atrocious anymore. TAA is a complete and utter joke and liability for their team at RB! Dude may be one of the most talented crossers and passers from the RB position in the world! But almost every other aspect of his game is one of the worst! Dude is SOOOO lazy on defense and when Liverpool is trying to press. I can't understand how Klopp lets him play still! He may create 1-2 goals a game or something like that. But he is directly responsible almost every single game for the goals that the team lets in! So it's not like their coming out ahead by having him in!?! They let in more goals with him out there, then the amount of goals he scores or creates. That guy needs to be told: "you either start playing defense and hustling, or your not playing!" And then Van Dyk and the rest of the D are also just falling apart the last year or so! Which is so unlike them. They used to be SO dominate and have their shizz together. The midfield is aging and teams can just walk right through them now. They are in need of a MAJOR overhaul over the next season or two, or they won't be back in the Champions League anytime soon.! So many of them look like they need to retire! It's so sad watching this once mighty team just fall apart in one season.   Credit to RM though for sticking with it, getting a bunch of lucky goals to get back in it and getting a huge win. They just KNOW how to win big games it seems like and they did the same thing last year! I think Bayern and RM are the two teams to beat this year! With Bayern being a whole level above all the other teams. They are SCARY good!
"Cultivate the space for himself." Can these announcers just not help themselves, are they compelled to utter stupid things all the time? For example, "over the hills and far away." Ugh.
The only solution for English football is more running and younger players 😂
Missed handball in the box at 5:16
Why is Joe Gomez still starting. They should of found a replacement last year or this seasons transfer window. He’s more of a sub player.
Madrid best team in the world!
Clearly age is just a number, how is Modric outrunning all of those younger kids?
Wow that's so unlike Alisson. He will com back stronger and wiser. Support for Alisson
Could see liverpool making that barca comeback against rm
All Goals Gomez fault. Liverpool should take him out.
Gomez has the most goal involvements in the match. Well, probably the last several... ok... all year. Unfortunately for him and Liverpool,  they're all goals against.
Liverpool fans just 🤫 quiet after  Stadium Falling minutes before,don’t celebrate too soon. It’s Real Madrid!!! ❤❤#1
benzema and vinicius braces love to see it
If Modric had the quality around him that Xavi and Iniesta had, he too would have won a World Cup. He is my midfield GOAT. 5 champions leagues, 3 la liga titles, 2nd place at the 2018 WC, 3rd place at the 2022 WC, ALL WON AFTER TURNING 30!!! Come on now 🔥
I love the English commentators, they couldn’t believe it.
EZ for Madrid
LOL Liverpool .Klopp mighty quiet for a loud mouth
Allison trying to run out of the stadium on the 5th goal apparently 🤣
The best club in the world! HalaMadrid! ⚪🟣 ❤
Real Madrid owns all the Orem team this game was no supposed we all knew real was gonna win but them scoring 5 official mean they have fully certified certificate of completion of Liverpool 😂 hala Madrid biggest club when it comes to Winning 🥇🥶🥶 “Barca fan “
Modric is so good
Let's stop hiding from the fact that Modric has become the best if not top 3 best midfielders of all time. I respect peoples opinion but i personally believe he truly has become the best mid fielder in the world.
How could Liverpool have known that after 15 minutes of elation the final 75+ minutes would be a dumpster fire...
What a comeback by Real Madrid, I am so happy when the English lose.
Dude, they must switch the name from champions league to Real Madrid cup. Real Madrid owns the shit now
Barca fan but hala Madrid 😊❤❤❤❤
Alisson or Karius? 🤔
I hope Real Madrid wins their 15th ucl
This was just funny to watch.  It's always a great day when Liverpool implode.
Hala madrid
too easy for us
I won all three bets yesterday hala Madrid ❤️
Lol Liverpool thought they had it in the bag 😂😂😂
love seeing English teams loose and better yet, English fans cry
Lets go madrid, barca are out, so triump for the SPANISH LADS, Glory for La liga!!
Imagine Mbappe in this Madrid side.
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
Wow!
Madrid…EPL CHAMPIONS
Nacho is so underrated
Funny thing is both keepers make silly mistake make it 2-2 that was just gift for Madrid.2-0 Liverpool need to do better to hold game but goes way wrong 😢
Madrid owns them
CBS commentators are really good unlike the ones in BT .
Last time liverpool lost badly in champions league at anfield was vs Atletico de madrid Spanish teams are surely Liverpool’s nightmare
On some serious shit klop needs to get rid of Gomez bro is a disgrace smh
Poor Gomez, a whole nightmare for the guy!!.
Liverpool fans started throwing fireworks... So Vini gave them a Carnaval.
🤍HalaMadrid🤍
That recovery and run up to the box by Darwin after he gave Sallah the pass at 2:06was insane. Sallah should have passed it back to Darwin he was literally alone but like always Mo gotta be the hero. Would have been a completely different game. Need to get rid of Sallah along with all the defense and midfield problems
Good to see Liverpool being found out for what they are, which is basically a washed up rock band. They had some hits years ago, but both they and their fans refuse to accept that the recent albums have been total shit and keep insisting that “no, the new songs are just as good as the hits”.  Just face it Liverpool fans, your team is too old, too out of form, and as much as you can delude yourselves about “net spend”, it’s not helped your team. Liverpool have fallen off a  cliff form wise, and every time you play a decent team they expose your weaknesses.
Bruh Madrid in the UCL are Lucky FC. I don't understand how they get so many fortunate goals year after year.
premiere league attacks look so ferocious until they play Ancelotti's Real Madrid
I’m glad rm golie messed up I hate how they did Navas!!!
Liverpool are trash!
Carlo ancelloti the best coach of all time. Enough said
Vinicious amazing reason comback
LOL
How awesome is Vinicius?
Why in tf are Liverpool scared to press on these dudes in defense like wtf bruh
Liverpool really went from being one of the top clubs in Europe to having a horrendous season. 8th in the PL and now allowing 5 at Anfield. What happened to their defense?
Bro real Madrid is getting 60% buff on ucl 💀
Real Madrid are a different team when they play champions league
This commentator couldn’t sound any less excited. At least try to make listening to you interesting
If trent and gomez play in the rematch, Madrid win again..
This most rig game ever
Dang it wrong minute
13:49 Courtois might get fired for that
Give Nacho his flowers The guy is a genius  He can read the game so well
We not finna talk about how nunez actually scored
Good ol LivahPoop always hype themselves then fall to Real 😂
Why none of these videos have quality higher than 720p, it's 2023...
Real Madrid is the greatest team of all time period v junior getting better every year
Liverpool lost the game because of a lot of errors from defenders MD keeper
Who walks into Anfield and makes them silent? No one but Madrid! Admittedly, they own the Champs League!
I love watching Liverpool fans cry😁
I think Guardiola's curse is on kloop now, kloop needs to apologize at Mane and all Africa about what he said. He never recognized Mane as one of the key player, chose vandjik over Mane and called Africa competition a small championship. When you're ungrateful you face Karma.
I love Madrid
Que grande eres Real Madrid,,,,más que un club
Real Madrid, "They had us in the first half"😂😂💯#HALAMADRID#14
Crazy game
liverpool got absolutely crapped on. 3 of those goals were easily defendable. like wtf was allison doing even?
man... i wonder who's gonna replace Benzi.  Whoever it is, he's got massive shoes to fill. Same goes to Modrich, Kroos, and last but not least Calvajal
I love watching English teams lose. :)
I love the bias from commentary. They went from all cheery to “ ohh I can’t believe it “
I’m Liverpool fan and am be honest with this Liverpool era is over like Erik ten hag said he first confress
The commentators were forced to eat crow tonight😂 they had an excuse for Liverpool on each of Madrid's goals. Couldn't just give credit to Madrid. HALA MADRID HDP
As soon as score was level, I had a feeling it would end up 5-2
Liverpool banging two goals early and Ancelotti cool as cucumber. RM starts banging goals and Ancelotti casually chewing gum, not moved, not impressed. What are OG.
5 goals at anfield.. wow
How Liverpool scored two goals but couldn’t defend the rest of the game and that’s their fault
Real showed dominance 😭 but can’t be suprised it’s in our DNA 😈
Don't Smug with madrid loserpool
I say modric retires til 45 !
What are the odds that Liverpool are up 2-0 at home and lose 5-2. 500-1?
Homie was offsides lol… killed the game
That’s what happened when you sell Sadio Mané
Highlights end at 2:43
Watch the last goal and watch the running from Robertson compared to Bajectic.
2:21 number 27 is wide open!!!
Madrid out here playing with two Balon D’or contenders
Sit and watch, Vini learnt how to score goals.
REALLLL!!
Wow, im a Madridista but even Im amazed at how Liverpool got made like chumps. They just let them run circles, its like they were static. Is it Klopps fault? Like that set piece practiced, did they even have a mark? They never thought to run after the 3 players lose in the box? Im a defender and this makes me angry, Im thinking they ran their hearts out by min 30 and that was game over. HALAMADRID! I cant believe how good this game turned out, i was kind of nervous, especially after that 2-0 😂
Vini and Benzema are an amazing duo 🔥
5 goals at Anfield is historic. Hala Madrid. Respect to Camavinga for being a maestro in midfield & Nacho for pocketing Salah
Shoutout to the Liverpool fans still hopeful they’ll get a miracle in a knockout second leg tie against Real Madrid in the magical Bernabeu
HALA MADRID
Dude Allison fgs, again same shhhhit
#HalaMadridyNadaMas🤍🤍🤍
klopp when his team scores: 👏 klopp when his team is scored against: 👏 Me: 🤔
Modric is different class man, generational talent.
Terrible mistake by Courtois You see this time n time again by goalkeepers  Why the heck don't they bomb the ball the he11 outta there
Real Madrid are underrated despite being so damn good. The recent Uefa club ranking put Liverpool,Chelsea,city above them. Teams they beat last season on route to winning the ucl and also winning la liga. They are the current champions of the Spain,Europe and the World. Was anyone really expecting Liverpool to win against this Real Madrid team that always deliver. The doubts only make them stronger and they are on course to win a back to back ucl AGAIN
Jr. was out there putting Trent on skates.
Keep Salah and sell Mane?
Real madrid well done 5-2  Liverpool fans next time you can put another fireworks 🎆
60 fps looks nice.
love the Rudiger and Militao duo
BENZ TRUK
Ya son clientes
Gomez man
Champions league games are weird. This was a weird game. You do t really see games like this in the Premier League
Nadie entiende que todos esos p. Partidos ya estan preparados eso normal
Liver pool is ass
Fantastic game by Liverpool. They played great and yet were splatted. Go Reds go! You played amazing!!! Always great to see Salah lose! Keep 'em coming!
Modric at 37 playing even better than when he was 27, jesus christ what a player!!
What a comeback once again in 2023 🔥️🔥️🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥️🔥️🔥
wait, Clive Tyldesley and Peter Drury on the commentary box?
Anyone gonna talk about how shitty the field was? Everyone slipping and sliding on both teams and both sides of the field. The goalkeeping was absolutely horrible here. Madrid fan here, happy for the W but my God, it was horrible.
Feel bad for the forwards. They did their job. This is literally FSGs fault. We saw this coming, the lack of investment was exposed big time today. Madrid won a UCL, they get Touchameni. Liverpool lose a UCL, that literally bought no one. It's a disgrace
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂🥳🤞🏾
I’m glad I didn’t watch this game Live. We desperately need world class defenders. Van Dijk had his time. Gomez idk why he’s still in the squad. We also desperately A CDM. Klopp kept stacking up attackers. We have the best attackers in the league and all top 5 Europe leagues. But as soon as we open up our legs and gets fu@led out attackers loose the momentum. I’ve seen this happen over and over again.  Real Madrid is officially Liverpool’s nightmare. How tf did we loose 2 finals against Real and they just do us like this in our home?  We were supposed to be the ones scoring 5 goals. But nah we’re nothing against real. Even when we had our best year in Liverpool history we couldn’t manage to beat Real Madrid. Man this pissed me off. And if you’re united fan. STFU 😂😂😂
Courtois is so lucky he plays for Real lmao
Liverpool’s archenemy
It’s not about how they really came back but How in the world was Modric    Able to handle them like that
This why Real Madrid are always favorite😂😂😂
honestly vinis 2nd goal threw Liverpool completely off track tbh.
This is a f****** karma how they treated Sadio Man'e actually Liverpool they not that bad but it seemed they cannot do anything right and I am f****** loving it f****** karma what goes around come around
Real Madrid is Real Madrid yesterday today and for ever tomorrow 🔥👏🏻🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Liverpool has become a small team.
Liverpool needed the result at the end of this game to be a win and up on aggregate going into the next match. They didn’t play for the entire 90 minutes they played for 45 and got comfortable.   To lose 5-2 at Anfield is despicable and they will need a 2019 Liverpool vs Barça like game to advance because in the Santiago Bernabéu, in the Champions League, I don’t see them scoring 4 goals and holding Madrid to none over the course of 90 minutes.
Still waiting for Salah to get his revenge on Madrid 😂
Goalkeepers keep breaking under pressure
Luka Modrics out of this world. Guys 37 years old but he doesn’t know that 😂
HALA MADRID
Liverpool needs to get another center back
Nunez play at 1:58 was fantastic. Held up ball on defense, spun the defender, and launched a counter-attack. Then made a lung-busting run across the field for an unmarked tap-in at the back post... of course Salah goes selfish and squanders it. No wonder Mane left.
Liver failure 😭😭
I just don’t get how Joe Gomez hasn’t been elevated by training at Liverpool so many years. How could he not improve? Or not get let go from the team
Always a treat to watch Modric play🍿🍿 ❤❤.
Damn, sunday league team can never complain about my keeping again.
I knew the game was starting but I didn't put it on to watch, I turn it on at Liverpool 2-5 Real Madrid I was like what the fuck is going on!? Haha
whos that no 43 on the fifth goal, you call yourself a footballer?!
I watched the game as soon as I saw vini score the first goal I knew there was hope for a comeback. He scored while being in between 4 Liverpool defenders. Then like 15 mins later he scores the 2nd I knew we was coming back
These commentators were horrible. Less emotion than Joe Buck
Good for My boy Vini. Freaken racist ass Hooligans
As a barca fan it brings me joy to see spanish teams destroy prem league teams like in this case liverpool thought they had it on the bag 😂😂 GGs to real madrid 💯
As a Bayern fan, I never really gave Real Madrid a lot of credit throughout the years, I know what they are capable of but I got to say that team is special and definitely should be the favorites to go all the way
Ngl, Modric's run at 12:47 to pass the ball to Vini Jr, who passed the ball to Big Benz for a goal is inspiring to say the least👏🙏🙌
Come on Thibaut Courtois why you leave the ball and you let Salah score goals 🤦
liverfool liverfool 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who thought of getting rid of Mané? Since he's gone nothing really is the same in the team
what the keepers
Can't wait for Manchester United to play Hala Madrid. Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool we're all beaten by  Madrid. 😫
Commentating was so one sided at first.. then once Madrid scored the energy just shifted as if everyone knew what was coming next 😂 Madrid sunk the nail in the coffin at this point
Can we appreciate how 37 year old Luka Modric is still bossing the midfield
Bent my algorithm analysis midterm and this. Good day lmao
These KINGZ Are Too Good
Y’all goal comments are so lame where’s the excitement 👎🏼👎🏼
Bro if Messi had the energy of modric he would have 11 ballon d ors 😂
Where’s that famous anfield atmosphere????
Liverpool have been ripped to shreds
Que baile.
Hala madrid simple as that
Ronaldo could be playing similar to Modric if only he would have stayed in Madrid. Such a shame
loving LP downfall, well done madrid
Allison into prime karius
Liverpool has just fukt around and found out.
“Premier League”
Real Madrid own Liverpool
Ancelotti made 🤨and Madrid scored 5 goals from nowhere
When you up 2 0 and end up loosing 5 2 something is very wrong with coaching.Also Liverpool without Mane is big fat 0.
I don't trust any man with a woman's name protecting my goal.
So good. Real Madrid is inspiring.
Vini was on a different level today. 2 goals and an assist, and nearly had 1 more of each. Turned the game around on his own which is usually Benzema’s job
Hey Klopp…. Can you PLEASE stop 🛑 starting Gakpo!!!!?????!!?!(!(!!( His game sucks for bus fare. Sincerely, Red Fans
If Matip is available, why would you play Gomez ahead of him?
Nunez had to taste from Real Madrid blood :))
The darwin nunez goal was genuinely impressive tho 👀
Complete and utter embarrassment but that’s the norm for Liverpool this season
https://youtu.be/2_O5YHX4urE
They called Vinicius Jr. a monkey. I guess today the banana is on you bitch!! 😂
Real Madrid League :))
I was watching the game but the babies were crying I had to watch highlights of real for 3 more   I respect my rivals cause no more Messi vs Ronaldo #ForcaBarca
Epic comeback from Real Madrid. Hala Madrid ❤️❤️👑🙌🎉
https://youtube.com/@Everydayadvice
Say what you will but Napoli will win the champions league
Modric is a beast. Nunez finish was sublime.
Let's go Liverpool is garbage
Commentators must be Liverpool fans
Thank you for not putting the score in the title!  Great game!
Liverpool I don’t like the goalkeeper  he makes a lot of mistake Mohammad salah he is selfish not really pass the ball,why Real Madrid   Win because really good defense junior he helps defend he too good ,I wan na say to Gergen klopp the players in front have to help defend too and whom play defense getting old too slow now pleas look for the new defense.
modric still playing like he's in his early 20s, crazy fr
PSG in 2017 is still worse, but this is one of the worst bottlejobs ever. 2-0 at home, then conceding 5 straight goals
@Liverpool yall really thought
Fatality 😤😤😤
This is madrid way
Joe Gomez has cost Liverpool at least 15 goals this season. Just the 2 here.
Goal number five. Watch multiple Liverpool players give up on trying to stop the run.
joe gomez being stupid again.... the foul to give up the free kick for the 3rd goal was terrible
Once again ,,, hearing the disappointment and sadness in ESPN commentators whenever Madrid scores in La Liga or CL is pure joy 🤩🤩🤩
Still wild to see the evolution of the connection between benzema and vini.
aw shit. here we go again
Parecendo partida do efootball, só gol estranho
5:33 was a game changer. The introduction of Nacho. The defense went solid form there on
VINI JR.  2 GOALS AND ASSIST HE OWNS LIVERPOOL🔥🔥 5 GOALS AGAINST THEM
Gomez needs to be better man
-
No way. Anfield was so quiet after the fifth goal you could hear the Spanish commentators yelling goal from the broadcast room.
Benzema and Modric showing the world why they are World Class and Ballon D Ors at an age when most retire
🙌🙌🔥
Damn, I’m a Barcelona fan and supported Liverpool up until Mane left. I can honestly say Madrid showed Liverpool levels!!! First time rooted for a Madrid win
Liverpool are slow learners. This is Real, you can't take a game for granted against them, even with an early 2-0 goal difference in your favour!
Man U would never
Anfield is almost always Liverpool's invincible haven, but Real Madrid is a homicidal murderer when playing away with the no-knock warranty 💀
Wow wow wow history repeats itself,  doubters are still surprised how madrid pulls it thru, it is almost comical now how they always make pundits eat dirt. Madrid is just  something else man when it comes to UCL. People make all kinna excuses from refs to VAR but Madrid's DNA is built for this. They just won't go away even if they are on brink of elimination. Funny thing is Real might just win it again defying all the odds, i know its early to say like how they have been inconsistent in the league and all, but what matters is if they pick right form at right time. Hala Madrid!!
I don't ever remember a match where Liverpool had so many hiccups. Fans must be shattered today. And I'm a UTD fan, its still tough to see at Anfield. 🌺🇬🇧⚽🥂🎸🍺
Klopp plays over and over 4-3-3 It never works against European teams only Epl ones... Madrid plays 6 in the back and with just 3 up front they shred you overand over.... Klopp wry laughs on sidelines says it all...
Crazy how Liverpool fans use fireworks outside the hotel Madrid are staying at just to lose 2-5
Liverpool is 🗑 this year.
Here to laugh at Liverpool
Liverpool love's us so much, they never want to see 👀 us 😭 , they'll do anything thing to make us happy. We love ❤️ you Liverpool🤣 .
Gomez caused two goals. He should not start the second leg
Modric is such a asset so good in the mid
Liverpool is soooo afraid
Proper ass whooping
At this point 👉 we Maried TO LIVERDRAID [Liverpool]
Poor Klopp…
TAA is a sham okie defender
HALA HALA HALA MADRID!!!
Real madrid is not my team but I can't help but have respect for the talent... Wow
Wasn’t the Liverpool crowd so loud singing “never walk alone” that you couldn’t hear anything and easily would lost hearing for a while how couldn’t they keep it up after the second half
Shows that real madrid purposely gives hope to other team in the beginning only to murder them at the end.
12:48 what a run by Modric. 37 years old and still playing with so much energy. Incredible.
The 3rd RM goal! what was VVD doing?! who was he marking exactly?... and this is supposedly the best defender in the world!!!
Only in Fifa 😂⚽️
Is Anfield slippery? Every second of the early part of this video players are slipping.
There's only one key 🔑 to a specific door 🚪. Jesus is the only key to unlock true peace, true love and many more!!!  HE IS THE KEY TO UNLOCK HEAVEN. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life, no one can come to the Father but through Jesus alone!!! Repent and put your faith in Jesus alone.
I’m gonna keep this short. Real Madrid was on fire 🔥. The comeback was crazy , started slow but caught up quick man. Liverpool wasn’t bad they just stopped for some reason pressuring and focused more on attacking. Real works great on the counter but focus on the defense first.  Well done   Hala Madrid !
these commentators r so bad 😭😭
This may be the beginning of the end of the Klopp era at Liverpool. I think roughly the same thing happened at Dortmund timewise
Modric is a top 5 best midfielder ever
I’m not a Madrid fan but They have no challengers in this Champions League I think they might win it again
Hala Madrid ⚪️🔵
I felt really bad for Gomez. Scapegoat for me
What a goal by Nunez. Too bad nobody will ever remember it
If Benzema played the World Cup France would have won vs Argentina
Hala Madrid!
I’m not surprised at all, Liverpool midfielders are finished already
liverpool poverty club
Most of the goal conceded are due to Joe Gomez , I am not only saying this match, you can replay most of the game losses of Liverpool. Basically he is Liverpool version of Harry maguire, maguire is slow but has some kind of position awareness. Gomez is fast but does not have any anticipation/position awareness at all. Maybe he is better to play at RB but absolutely not CB
Real Madrid is the best when it comes to the UCL, it’s in their DNA. Liverpool is pure rubbish this season. It was expected.
Madrid own liverpool
Liverpool needs at least 3 sharps midfielders and central back cause gomez is not reliable player
Liverpool simply got embarrassed.
Fabinho sleeping
The wheels came off when Liverpool thought they didn’t need Sadio Manè
Same on Liverpool this is for mane
Lol at 12:57 Anfield is so quiet you can hear the Spanish commentator in the next press box yelling "GOOOOOOOOOL!"
Clive Tyldesley is so good on the ear. Always refreshing to hear him commentating. One of the all time greats along with Peter Drury.
Klopp asked fans to book Istanbul final this year. I hope the fans kept the receipts.
Benezema & Modric are GOATED 🐐
Anyone to say that Liverpools “reign” was significant in today’s game are delusional. 2 trophies don’t amount the bullshit that this club was hyped for. I’m a Man U fan. Granted..I’m in no state to argue BUT this makes me happy. Manchester. Madrid. In that order so y’all can argue the rest.
😂😂 for Liverpool
Why didn't the goalie grab the ball at 2:34?
Rubbish
6:22 Alisson learning from Kairus
Vini shut the haters up. Hala Madrid!
liverpool fans still behind klopp?
Them Liverpool fans were doing all that talking after being up 2-0 😂😂 where y’all at now ? Real quiet now
Just hit me this is the second time in three years Liverpool have lost to a madrid team at a anfield
Who is the color analyst
Ouch
This was a capitulation of epic proportions
I love how Moe just let the pressure of the keeper for a second and  lulled him into a false sense of security on that  second goal!!!!!
Pish poor!
VAMOS REAL!!!! CAMPEOONESSSS
That's one of those matches that looks like FIFA game lol
Verguenga total de liverpool
Vinícius is Amazing
SMH obviously these English league teams don't understand how to play Real. It's just amazing to me  how they can barely win in La Liga and blow out the English clubs. Well you don't let them run on you. And you shut down Vinny Jr. If not; well you saw what happened.
Nacho is just class....I love that guy.
El Madrid es el papá en champions.
Nuñez gol was a poem!
Ain't nobody f*@# with us this year .......Hala! MADRID!!🏆
Nacho is genuinely such a class player.
Premier league suck
Idk why Gomez is still getting playing time! His a horrible CB🤬😤
Legendary day in UCL History.
I’m new to Fútbol (American) but guys like Vini Jr and Marcus Rashford keep me coming back for more!
Trust me. Liverpool repeat the 4-0 miracle with real madrid. I'm calling it Nunez hat trick with Walsh winning goal
I hate football
lmao 0:40  in towards gakpo.....    its darwin nunez      bruh what 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣
Courtois and Alisson had a tea party this game
Liverpool have absolutely zero backbone. This lot is done, and klopps game management is embarassingly poor.
I feel bad for Allison, since I feel the defense made him look worse than the on paper results. The first goal was a hard angle to save for any keeper and that was more Gomez's responsibility to not give vini Jr such a shot from outside the box. Then there was sort of an OG by gomez. Then the free running header by militao that noone covered. However he did have a bad game allowing that error though.  It looked like madrid attacked the left side 50% of the time and made a lot of their plays from there to play balls in centrally. Defensively the CB, the CM, and the right hand side of Liverpool were just very poor. Robertson is the only one I feel that did a solid job on the left hand side defensively against rodrygo. Nunez initiated some plays and did some decent defensive contribution. It seems like Liverpool really needs to address the midfield defensively and the CBs during the transfer window. It has been ongoing issue even before this game. TAA is not a defensive rb and that's fine since at least he compensates offensively and made big plays and key passes, but it becomes a huge hole when the cbs and cms can't compensate for it when most opposition attacks and key passes come from his side.
How was the third goal not easy to defend? My 5 year old can defend that set piece better !! Hala Madrid!!
This is UCL. Unbelievable Result. Unprecedented Game.
Gomez is so bad.
Never heard Darwin’s name after that hahaha HALA MADRID
Real Madrid makes the champions league the champions league. That team is insane 🔥🔥🔥
Modric is a machine wow.
In the fifth goal, the way Luka Modric stole the ball and drove it is incredible with his experience. He was like a beast at the age of 37.
Real Madrid is  all Vini at the moment. They play counter attack and he is the driving force in that with his speed and technical skills.  But for Pool, their problem is the right back and midfield. I think Jurgen needs to resign.
Hala Madrid!!
Modric needs to be in a battery commercial from how much energy he has 😮
Never seen a team do this at Anfield in my life
Hala Madrid
That goalie is a SIEVE.  What an imbecil. They make the goals in the front and they lose the match in the back.  🤔😒🙄
😂 y’all thought
Modric!!! The greatest midfielder in the history of the game!!!!
Nothing lasts forever, and no tactic or or way of play is dominant for too long. I think Klopp's football time is over and needs a major overhaul.  He's been figured out. Obviously Mane's departure was a massive blow , but the blitzkrieg style of football is very demanding and unsustainable . Ancelotti's team gave away the first 20 minutes , conceded two goals in the process, but controlled the whole rest of the game, and then managed to score FIVE. I think it is time for Klopp to learn the Scolari, Lippi and Wenger lesson and take a break from trying to replicate the successes of a Liverpool style of play whose time has already passed. Maybe a different league with a middle table project team, then come back to compete in a major league.  Liverpool is currently turning into the new Man utd
I feel like Modric and a few other players are aging like the finest of wine 👌
On Vinicius goal, 3 Liverpool players are right there yet not one challenged him...Against a team like Madrid, its not the way to play!
Wow. It's the way they did it. It's like they had the worst fortune in the beginning and then it all flipped
Still cant believe it. 5 goals in Anfield 😳 Hala madrid!
The complacency after going 2-0 up.. incredible stuff. Shipping 5 goals without reply is a massive collapse. I had to leave the game at 2-2, and the winner was clear at that point.
It takes only one goal for Real Madrid to wake up and the rest is history!!. 👍👍👍👍Hala Madrid..
No one is going to comment on why everyone is slipping?😂😂
W
When it comes to Champions League, Madrid will find every means to win no matter what. Let’s just leave UCL for Madrid….HALA MADRID..!!❤
La Liga teams are just built different thats the truth. EPL good, La Liga a bit too good.
0:41 The commentator thought it was Cody but was Nunez😂😂
9:38 the cut to Mauricio looks like a straight mob boss here
Bravo Madrid 👏🏽
Liverpool sucks.
12:50 I am sorry but WHAT THE FUCK IS #43 Bajcetic doing this whole attack???
What a comeback from GODATHERS OF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE!. 2-0 down to 5-2. Liverpool lasted for only 20 minutes and then the grilling by Real Madrid started. Liverpool were roasted fully and torn into pieces within next 70 minutes.What a meltdown of Liverpool.They crumbled under their own weight of early lead and did not know how to maintain it. It started from very irresponsible,negligent and arrogant behaviour of Allison, goalkeeper of Liverpool,conceding the   second goal.The defence of Liverpool was shambolic.They could not control even one person who is riding on their nerves since last year Champion League Final......Vinicius Junior.
Just me, or do goalkeepers suck these days?
Modric took off on that last goal. I thought it was valverde. 🤣
12:49  Benzema’s goal was just insane. What a finish. Cold as liquid nitrogen
13:38 I hope Kolo muani is somewhere taking notes merci les bleus
Benzema should have passed it back to Vini for the hat trick.
Fabinho gifted them those last 2 goals
As a Barca fan it makes me angry we couldn’t even score 1 goal just 1 goal.. and Real Madrid score 5!! After going 2-0 down. Madrid are just built different thats the difference in mentalities. Gotta appreciate the greatness while its there 🙏
Klopp! Set Salah to play make instead of Anderson and thank me later.  Liverpools midfield solution to save this season top4 is Salah to play make.
Hala Madrid ❤❤
You never get bantered alone.
Two Liverpool penalties unanswered…
Modric is the only athlete I can think of that is at his peak in his late 30s
Allison was shocking, made mistakes that led to 3 goals
Real Madrid is a rest of the world team.
What the heck happened to Liverpool defenses?
PLEASE WHOEVER MAY IT BE, KNOCK REAL MADRID OUT!!!! PLEEEEASE
I feel sorry for Salah. He was brilliant but his teammates failed him.
Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk god dammit
If klopp was smart he would’ve put van dijk at right back. Vini was taking Trent and joe all night long
In towards GAKPOOOOO...it's Darwin Nunez! haha
It’s giving Karius
biggest comeback of all time
Hala madrid!!
See this is why I don’t like Trent Alexander-Arnold considering how people think he that good. He might be good up front, but he always sleeps in the back. Real Madrid’s third goal was Trents fault loosing his man and just stood there. He’s done it many times now sleeping in the back. Because that third goal from Real was the breaking point and for Liverpool too
This was the most devastating event for Liverpool history. Madrid with Ronaldo couldn't do it. Great job even though im not a big fan of Madrid
Y’all remember that poll that said Liverpool had a higher percentage than Real on winning?
Courtois gave them that goal because the 1-0 wasnt fair it was gonna be too easy of a match 😏
We got our ass handing too embarrassing
How is no one here mentioning joe Gomez? 😅
Benzema is the definition of a world class #9. Nobody shows up time and time again at the highest levels of Champions League like he does. To wear that #9, for that team, for that long and win that many trophies is unreal.
Wtf happened to the grass today
9:15 😂💀💀😭 Wtf THE WHO LIVERPOOL TEAM WAS RIGHT THERE. SOMEONE MARK MILITAO 💀💀😭
That had to hurt!
Premier League really getting exposed in europe this season...
real madrid are like a shark in a pool of liver
Jajaja como estan a Navas esa jirafa con esas patas nunca a prendido a jugar
"Just wait til Real come to Anfield😭🤡."
watching liverpool lose like this gives me joy
not on a level at all
7:03 I’ve never been a fan of passing back to the goal keeper Joe Gomez had SOOOOOO MUCH SPACE he could of kept it and ran to the corner or went in a circle but STOP  passing back
I've been a Madrid fan my entire life, so don't worry... we can't explain it either
Eerf
Real madrid are winning
Modruch he is the best of best all the time
Esto no es La Liga, donde todos los equipos se encierran en el arco a especular y hacer que no se juegue
Liverpool look like a midfield team out there . Oh wait . .
not hating but you can’t be so happy and confident scoring twice against RM, less un the UCL, you can’t lose focus when you play against football royalty, hope Liverpool learned that lesson HALA MADRID Y NADA MÁS 👑
real madrid made this look easy, liverpool at anfield is quite the feat, but the moment is never too big for them
Liverpool could have won this game but it’s obvious they are scared of Madrid with their body language
Vinicius two goals two assistance👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I want to hate madrid so bad but they show what happens when you have more talent and heart. They trying to win me over and im scared it might work
Gakpo was a no show . Again
What a game!
Liverpool 🤡 🤡
Bro nacho changed the game from the moment he stepped on the field. Alaba is too slow and too stiff for real madrid he needs to ride the bench
You know the game is done when Klopp just starts smiling at his team getting packed in. Man is in shambles....
12:49 Luca modric is fighting for another ballon d’or against 13:37 Benzema and 4:32 Vinicius cracks😮😮😮
Salad doesn’t pass anymore 😢
What a Shameful Display!  Congrats to RM.
My parley went crazyyyy thanks to Madrid… did a 120$ dollar bet… y’all do the odds when it was 2-0! Knew Madrid would clutch. This competition is theirs. Every single year.
"You'll Never Walk Alone" seems like a far cry!
Good Coaching that values players for their merit always wins. Thanks Benzema and Co. What a football lesson!
Just cannot stop talking about this man, Luka Modric. 37 years old and still ripping liverpool midfield apart like it’s nothing. Best CM in the world. And he still have years left.
F🎉🎉🎉 Real Madrid. Liverpool will win the 2nd leg!!!
I thought Real was dominant because of Cristiano but it might have been the opposite
Loll the commentators don’t even get excited when Madrid scored, haters
Is either Liverpool buy players or they keep on losing games this season....
After being 2-0 down, Real Madrid just doing a reality check.
Damn! I pity whoever missed this match and still doesn't get to see the highlights cos this is one for all history... Vini, Benzema, and Modric were all superb... the way Modric stole the ball and outran the midfield and defence for that last goal was just amazing to see...the finishing from Benzema too 😭😭😭 Since Modric's contract ends soon, I hope united get him cos he still plays like he's 19 and has all the energy in the world...
If only salah had an experienced player in the attack although Nunez did what he could
11:49 Im sorry, but how is that a yellow? Fabinho is trying to play quick, Vini prevents it. Play on!
Pepe, Ramos, Ronaldo, Casemiro…. The dirty ones left. This team is actually a group of nice clean guys.
Anyone else feel like the commentating wasn’t passionate at all? It just felt like regular play calling when goals were scored
Real madrid bad bad dem is the best
Proud of Nunez and Salah but Liverpool can’t catch a break vs Midrid 🤦‍♂️
this is the worst thing ive ever seen
Cheeee. Qué pedorros son los arqueros en Europa! El Dibu y Armani les pasan la zuela por la nariz sin transpirarse. Jajajaja vamo argentina carajooooo
Feel sorry for Liverpool
Liverpool were lethal when Mane was around. He even brought the most out of Mo Salah. Now, Liverpool are very inconsistent with the so-many players they keep experimenting with. If it's not broken, why fix it?!
Liverpool really need to fix that midfield along with the Center backs, Fkn Atrocios!!  That young mildgielder had no business starting, and Gomez is just sht time and time again
La Liga > EPL 😂🤣
This game was so intense. Liverpool started well with high pressure but Real Madrid is one team who knows how to keep calm and turn things around.
Oh boy….
Virgil Van Dijk is the single most overrated footballer of all time.
As an American I have rarely watched a soccer "football" match that wasn't part of the Olympics however I was able to catch this match and I have to say it definitely has me intrigued. This was an exciting match Madrid played absolutely excellently today.
If you are hating on Madrid and saying we got lucky and had the refs help, just stop watching football. you are braindead.
To you all people I present you… REAL MADRID IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE!!! What a performance 🤩
This Liverpool team is complete joke
Two of my favorite teams going at it. Todays game showed me why I’d rather watch a Real Madrid game over Liverpool
Ok I’m happy with 2 goals scored against Real Madrid also what a goal for Nunez! Now we just need a origi Prayer. I can’t believe we gave up a a 2-0 lead to 2-5… 😢
I just stop at the 15 minute mark and pretend is over 😢😢
Joe Gomes a true farmer
Liverpool sucks lol
They using the superbowl grass??
Solo hay que cambiar a Neruda por vinicius Para decir que este ah sido El mejor poema que se ah escrito en El mundo del futbol...
Van Dyke the most overrated defender but the English bandits (sorry pundits) live him. They blame everybody but him.
Watching those clowns chant Liverpool after even going down 5-2 brought immense joy, deluded fans, with a deluded coach, will be mid for another 30 years
Unexpected scenario game but give credit to the champion of Europe. There is one more game left and everything can happened.
Henderson had to go. And Arnold needs to play mid. Liverpool is to slow
How to beat Real Madrid in the UCL 1. Don't score the first goal
Barcelona fan when madrid wins  : wow they did great  Madrid fans when Barca wins : it’s the referee
Wow 🫣 saw this on tv, walked alone today for sure
Vinicious 🏆
Vini needs to score more goals in la liga like his first goal here
L U K A   M O D R I C !
Every one's talking about Ronald playing at 36, modric is playing way better ball game than Ronaldo and they're nearly the same age, modric is still fit, and there's alot more players that's still playing good ball at 36 and older but no one is recognizing them, just Ronaldo and he's not even playing well, modric is awesome
What a Game!!!!!
Liverpools defense is just so stiff, Gomez has always been a questionable pick for starting lineup
This show Real Madrid are never to be underestimated in the champions league. They could win it again. That team is very scary
Gómez 😂🤣😂 Thanks Liverpool
)_NEVER SAY DIE UNTIL YOU DEAD, LOL)_
#vini #benzema #ancelotti
Down 2-0 @ Anfield… no problem for Madrid.
Joe Gomez is the problem in the defense 😒 idk why he still playing there
Every single time Liverpool just lets Madrid run them over smh
Goalkeepers are just trash footballers for the most part or else they’d be on the field
Nunez actually scored 😮
Liverduck
my cousin is gonna be crying rn
Commentators were really sucking off Liverpool this game lmfaoo
Vini 🔥. What a game !!
Who else noticed Camavinga slips in ucl matches all the time
Becker looking like Karius 😂😂😂
World class performance from Madrid.
Alisson really told Courtois "You'll never walk alone"
I used to pray everyday Real Madrid played that Luka Modric would get the appreciation he deserved, truly a world best at what he does ❤️‍🔥💙
Liverpool fans 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
There's Real Madrid! And there's EVERYONE else trying or will DIE trying.  Learn to be humble when you play!  Get on your knees and kiss the ring! Never forget.....
Salah can not play 90
Madrid never gives up they fight till the end when it comes UCL idk how the do that
2-0 down in 15 minutes from kick off and i was just thinking the game against macity. Modric and vini showed up big 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
Vini vs TAA was always going to lead to a lot of goals. Salah I don’t think has helped out defensively once the entire season
As a Barca fan. Thank you Real, I tip my hat off to u for utterly embarrassing Liverpool at their home field
real madrid is something else when it comes to championsleague 🤫🤫
So disappointed in Liverpool.
Liverpool defenders are scared of the ball, they turn and twist with the slightest touch of the ball from the opponents.
Rumor has says Liverpool are still waiting for Madrid to take that freekick from minute47 just like Barcelona has been waiting for that corner kick on the other side of the field
They say liverpool does the Best combacks 💀 in anfield too deserved
Where Owen on here? He thinks loserpool are the best and should’ve beaten RM last year and it was a fluke they lost. Where’s the B I T C H at?
Modric > Xavi or Iniesta. Straight up. From a Barca fan.
O militao KKKKKKK
This is what happens Madrid are at their healthiest congrats on the big win today
I watched this live and had to turn off at half due to work. Wow.
I’m truly convinced these games be rigged for gambling purposes
Real making it look eassssyyyyyy 😂
Gomez looks completely lost in all Madrid’s goals, it’s pathetic
Me: There’s no way they could win it again consecutively Real Madrid: wins it again consecutively*
Damn Modric really went crazy with that ball steal.
the premier league is the money league la liga got the real bogeyman
This won't stop us. I mean it's a REAL ragiddy ass team.
One day, Modric will become a new pope and lead the Roman Catholic Church during these difficult times😊
Liverpool’s problem is that they suck, nah but really they seem to relax because they are in the lead
Liverpool in the mud, inject it.
That fifth Madrid goal was a thing of beauty.  Apart from that this game shall be known as “The Ghost of Loris Karius.”
Kings of Europe 👑
Fabino Out?
If you want to love a club, love Los Blancos! 💯💪
I'm just here to appreciate that fantastic finish from Nunez and I'm out ✌️
Big mistake of continuing with Salah and letting Mane go, all I’m saying
When Liverpool scored the 2nd I forsure thought I was losing my fanduel bet but nope 😂😂
Klopp’s days are over 😂
Joe Gomez (and Liverpool D) is absolutely horrific 😂😂
Its so relieving watching the  Muslim Algerian Karim Benzema destroying an English team.
Liverpool need to get a caicedo or a Declan rice and Bellingham and get chiesa who im sure is going to be on sale this season to revamp the midfield. The forwards are great they just need some time together Darwin and gakpo are looking better especially Darwin helping out the midfield but Harvey and the other youngster isn’t going to cut it.
Real madrid own Liverpool 😂
Spanish futbol commentators >>>> English futbol commentators
If Mbappe had played like vini did today at anfield, you would be hearing about his performance for the next 2 weeks. It’s about time people started putting Vini at that table. He’s been carrying this team for at least 2 years now and is the best winger in the world in my opinion. I’m a Barça fan btw, but sometimes you gotta recognize greatness. Araujo is waiting for you btw.
Never Mess with Real Madrid in a CL game
Madrid is just better. Better players and better coach.
Watching that smug prick Klopp look bewildered is so satisfying
This is why you dont score first against real madrid
Great to see Liverpool get trounced
Told you Ronaldo wasn't needed
Royal tennenbaum tennis match?
Estoy Feliz por mi real Madrid.,    Liverpool pobrecitooooooo
2:20 selfish play by Salah like always could’ve pass that to Gakpo and it would’ve been a goal
Liverpool played themselves
And yet there’s still people thinking that the premier league is the best league in the world 😂
Nag they took that personal💀
This is what happens when mid premier league teams face world champions
F#%k Real Madrid
As a goalkeeper I can say that making a goalkeeper mistake is very common and I don’t blame either team, I can’t imagine the pressure of being in the last 16 and then just having to perform your best. Respect
This Real Madrid team is unreal
Watching Real Madrid play? you gotta watch till the end ! Damn, what a champion mentality from Real Madrid ! Congratulations
I’ll say it again; since Sadio Mane left the pressing and dangerous energy in Liverpool disappeared. Teams and players use to be afraid of Liverpool because of their attack, and the player they were more scared of is Sadio Mane. Mane was a nightmare for defenders and goalkeepers when he played for Liverpool; but now Liverpool are just like any other team, no one is scared of them anymore. Their battle for champions league is over after this defeat. Klopp messed up big time; he should have done everything he could to keep Sadio Mane. Sad situation
Get Salah some help! He shouldnt be doing everything.
Liverpool will forever be Real Madrids punching back lol
Vinny owns Liverpool. Name of one the stands after him 🤣😂
Why don’t footballers wait till the match is over before celebrating 😂😂😂
That last goal 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
“Commentators are not biased” - these mfs:
Carlo, one of the greatest manager  of all time.
Have Caucasians stopped playing football?
Liverpool shouldn't bother to show up for the 2nd leg of UCL.  What is the point?
Team of miracles for a reason
They should put one of those disturbing images warning before this video
The silence after vinnys second goal.. just wow and hilarious 🤯🤣😂😂😂
who is this announcer. you'd think that real madrid didn't even score a goal and it finished 2-0 liverpool the way he's commentating.
Fact; 95% of the likes for these highlights will be from Man United fans 😂
Fun fact: Al Hilal scored more goals against Real Madrid than Liverpool, and Liverpool were at Anfield 😳
That's LFC this season, play well in spurts but cannot keep the lead and eventually let in the opposition to overtake them. Sure couple of goals had a shade of luck but that's because LFC's defense allowed that to happen.  Of course RM are an excellent team. Maybe LFC should try a back three to let TAA keep foraging forward to offset his defensive frailties. Out of all cups meekly, top four would be a stretch, Europa League next season would be bonus. Season to forget.
Wtf is cortouis doing lmao hello lol
Madrid is not good but Liverpool is terrible.
holy shit...joe gomez and fabihno lmaooooo why are they playing?
Seeing Liverpool celebrate the Salah goal is like seeing passengers board the Titanic.
Real Madrid got Liverpool number
Looks like Alison bet against Liverpool there lol
This is what it’s like playing fifa on ultimate difficulty
Where are all The EPL fans ? 😂😂😂😂😂
Liverpool’s coach made a big mistake kicking sadio mané and replacing him with Diaz Ngl this is embarrassing
Loserpool
Let's just blame it on LOVREN 😅😂🤣
Hala Madrid y nada mas hasta la muerte vamos con todo. Let’s fucken go Madrid te amo 🤍🤍
43 could have stopped that fifth goal if he kept running, he just stood there and watched karim set up for the goal.
If Henderson has one gear Modric has 6. Genius.
The change in the commentators' tone after real madrid do what they do best, was kina amusing, clearly they went for Liverpool.
salah became shit
What a game, watching this live was crazy. Madrid was fantastic: Vino, Benzema, Valverde, Modric and credit to Nacho as well.  One thing I did realize is that the pitch was incredibly slippery
Should’ve been 2 pens for Liverpool but sure
Stadium got quiter after the 20'
Wow! What a team!!!!
Alison: I call your howler, and I raise 3 more goals. Courteous: OK, you win!
If you’re a neutral or a Real Madrid fan you should be disgusted by the commentary.  Again notice their reaction when liverpool scores compared to real madrids 5 goals.  Theres no emotion for Real Madrid but for liverpool it’s a different story.  I actually enjoyed the American commentary from the World Cup.  Paramount please get less biased English commentary, preferably non British.
Wtf is going on with football now 💀💀
it should have really been 1-3, it's a pity, the score does the reflect the performance, that first and last goal by nunez and benzema were crazy
Where was that goalie so far out on Vinicius goal.  He gave away his left post.  Look at that space he left.  What an idiot.  No wonder they lose matches.  😒🙄🤔😝
Joe Gomez is a bum huh. Makes Harry Maguire look like prime Ramos
Only 3 things are certain in life: Death Taxes  And Salah not getting his revenge.
Absolute Masterclass
Watching Robertson, Henderson, and Gomez's heads turn like chickens to watch the ball fly by made me spill my beer
Wow As an Ajax fan, I am happy we didn't make it as second place.
Liverpool puede jugar en la liga colombiana y no ser campeón lol
Curtouis or Karius???!!!!!
You’ll never win again 😙
Liverpoop 😅 gotta love it
Are the commentators Liverpool fans? 😂
Benzema is best
Karim Benzema the new G.O.A.T of Real Madrid
Man that fake crowd noise is something else
Hala Madrid
After watching the World Cup the commentary for normal matches is so blah
Liverpool fans 😁😂😂
Don Carlo got 5-0 next time
That Benzema move on Allisson…wow😮
wasn’t Nunez offside for the first goal? looks like his left arm
“Liverpool have been ripped to shreds” sheesh couldn’t be any more true
My God we had it in our hand what a luck 😮
Wow that was absolutely Brutal for Liverpool, they looked amazing, then it all went wrong.
Salad must have said sorry for the 2nd goal that was why they were all shot down today.
Hihihihihi
The fascist dumb ignorant Spain doesn't deserve Vini Jr or any joyful player! The aggressions against him just show the world how disgusting and despicable this country is. Hope he will play on PSG very soon!
Shittiest commentator reactions for the RM goals
Very high-tempo game, what a game!!!
CHOKE
if my manager smiles when we get scored on we definitely losing the game lmaoooo🤣
This match was like watching two friends play FIFA .  The goalkeepers glitch and crazy goals.. lol
Hala madrid
Real Madrid got Liverpools number
Best team in the world. 🤍 HALA MADRID
Liverpool seem scared. They got alll the talent plz coke coke
As a Barca and ManU fan it's hard to find who to support.
Ahhh feels so good. Glory Glory Man United.
Gomez is a bad centerback
I lost respect for Liverpool after this match
Bajcetic is a great kid with tremendous potential, but he can't play at the highest level just yet.
That's called a Champion Mentality #HalaMadrid
This was embarassing I hate how mentally weak Liverpool have become. Mentality MIDGETS!
Damn. Had it not been the sub highlight, I would have forgotten Bobby stil in Liverpool. That hurts💔
Real were like "so you gonna embarrass my goalie let's see how you like it" 5-2
Can someone remind modric that he is old😂😂😂this man is on fire
Karim benzema is doing really good so far i mean he beat psg
in my opinion i think real madrid is the best club and im a bug real madrid fan
as a liverpool fan i never feel at ease when we're up 2-0. it's never comfortable... 😔
There’s only one king in Europe 👑🤍🇪🇸
Come back KINGS of Champions League
It was a good run for a mid table team to go against Real Madrid
No wonder Mane left. Salah is so selfish they’ll never win
Núñez is a donut
Mayonnaise & co thought they had it 2 lucky goals..guess what this is Madrid boys. Welcome.
I hate how unexciting English commentary is
Commentators scream when Liverpool score, but when Madrid score they don’t even try 😂
I remember playing football in the 80s and '90s and goalkeepers were always terrible. Outfield players. It looks like they still are a bless them.🤣 Crazy Game.
Real Madrid was having fun out there 😂
As a Barca fan, Madrid played insane today. Watching Modric and benzema take charge of this game was mad. Modric is class and is in my top 5 players man.
Well damn.
Imagine if this Real Madrids UCL campaign repeats last years but in reverse?! Liverpool, City, Chelsea then PSG in the Final..
WHAT A HEADER FROM MILITAO‼️ How come nobody’s mentioning that 🤯 Prolific canon of a header. These Brazilian players are something else 🙌
Real and Barca running over English teams in my whole lifetime and they still keep saying how the PL is the strongest league in the world 🥱
Liverpool back to being Liverpool
Absolutely tactical superiority. Simple as that. Real Madrid just play better.
Hala madrid. Good bye wanna bes
What a game !! Really enjoyed it 🔥
The Premier League is so overrated it's unbelievable. Only 1 team in knockout games so far even got a draw, every other one lost.
these commentators be talking crazy tgen shut up wheb they get scored on
If the referee called the penatlies it would have been 6-4
It’s funny, years ago Benzema said “Vini was against them” and now look at them
Did militao trip in his celebración 😂
They were up 2-0…
If i were on Madrid, I'd be talking so much trash to the Liverpool supporters lol
Gomez was getting cooked all night smh
Karim Benzema
14:04  Barcas nightmare!🤣
I love to see Madrid embarrass the most overrated club of all time again and again 🤣. The fan boy Media favorite team is fighting for Europa where they belong
Where Are you at annoying nut hugging liverpool fans ? What’s the excuse now?2-0 lead and bottles it like In the league and finals😂 get humbled Foreal this time because at the bernabeu it’s going to be a whole vid
Easy game 😂
Klopp taking too many notes from Ole and Ralf.
Such a weird match for the goal keepers, blunders everywhere 😆
Klopp needs to stop playing favourites. Salah should be taken off not Nunez. And why on earth do you bring on James Milner whose 37 when you are losing 5 goals to 2. What exactly is he going to do, run down the flanks and dribble past two and score.  Garbage all around from the Manager down to the subs. It's time they walked alone.
I've never been so annoyed at a football game in my life
Hala Madrid papa 😎💣🔥
OMG Liverpool got destroy at home 😮 Real Madrid 🖐️ Liverpool 2 Congratulations Real Madrid🙌
Holy smoke!!😳 So impressive to see Modric hit the after-burners ,fend off the shoulder challenge then send a neat pass on that goal 😎 Age is just a number indeed💪
Hala Madrid
I am 2:55 and Liverpool are up 2 nil. How the hell did they squander this game to lose FIVE - Two!!!
Fireworks at 2am can not help Liverpool win the match 😂😂
Real Madrid: champions of England
Fun fact:  Real Madrid are the first team in UEFA Champions League history to comeback from 2 goals down and win by a three-goal margin
This game is a perfect example of what happens when you water a field with Vaseline.
Liverpool are back! 🤣🤣
Vinicius  and benzema were crazy. Dnt know why he didnt get to play for france.
galpo is trashhhhhhh
Why do i feel that this match is RIGGED.....? MATCH FIXING by the MAFIAs........most of the GOALS by both the teams are unusual.........
Joe Gomez has never been good. I don’t understand why he plays a single minute in a Liverpool kit
RM beating up on mid table PL clubs
Real owns the champions.
Luka Modric, wow what a player He is! He runs like if He was still in his 20s!!
La liga making the prem their kids once again. Just too easy
Different levels Liverpool, different levels.
Liverpool need a Big Time Shake-Up or they will stay Outside the Top 6 for quite some time!
What a comedy of errors by the keepers!  Shows they're just human.  Look...Militao's header is quite common-place internationally in football.  90% of the time I witness players defending in their own box "looking for space" ?!?!?  Good grief...the ball won't go in by itself!!  SOMEONE has to put it in!  Watch the opposition in your box and stop WAITING to see if the ball happens to come your way!  If your assigned opposing player makes a run, SO DO YOU, regardless of where the ball goes!!!   Then...Benzema dekes the shorts right off of THREE Liverpodlian defenders.  I feel for Klopp - GREAT manager!  Liverpool were simply out-classed.
Strange game
Hahahah seeing the scousers get mopped is hilarious
Modric is the best midfielder in the history of football, you can't convince me otherwise...this man is 37 years old and is still playing like he's in his early 20's, absolute BEAST.
I was so happy
I don't know if I'm more surprised by Darwin hitting the target on his goal or by Madrid scoring five goals on Liverpool at Anfield!
Champions League Madrid is something else. Those 2 balon d 'or winners are winner for a reason, no matter the age.
Liverpool midfeild cant even control the ball. So embrassing
Didn’t know karius returned to anfield
What happened to the best fortress of European nights in england the character of Liverpool was not this what happened they had the tenacity aggression we haven't seen any of that tonight forget about the scoreline this Liverpool team lost badly and is actually good for them start from the ground up no matter what I'm a Chelsea fan and gutted with this performance not like we are any worse
Liverpool can’t beat Madrid, what’s wrong with them?
How's Modric playing like this at this age. His break into the midfield for that last goal was everything!
2 thing I learned today  1) Alisson Becker is an overrated GK 2) liverpool is a shadow of their previous self.
Any sharp striker plays for real madrid will get d'or ballon.
Unbelievable...
Nunez goal 😮‍💨
Brilliant to hear the commentators lauding Liverpool after they score two quick goals. Class team. Oh, hang on a minute.......
Bajcetic is rubbish. Watching his team conceding five goals from a few yards away every goal😂
Commentator is not even trying to hide his bias
How vini is out of the top 20 players, no one can explain that
No surprise Liverpool has been in shambles this season, if they weren’t called Liverpool people wouldn’t have been surprised to see them lose in this way.
woah, modric and benzema trashed liverpool on that last goal😳
lmao you can hear the spanish commentators in the background 12:55
Salah revenge loading since ......... ............ ..............
Absolute disgrace. This is a demolition.
For once and for all. Never but never believe Real Madrid is dead
The announcers in this game were so sad 😂😂😂
The run from Modric at 12:50...wow. The power, ferocity, and the elegance of a lion king
It must be so nice being a Real Madrid fan , Liverpool “wheres your famous atmosphere, wheres your famous atmosphere”… Forza Inter ⚫️🔵🐍
Hey Liverpool it's me , listen what's going on with you , I feel like your heart isn't in it ,if I can help just let me know
When I saw Salah making the 2-0 I was already waitting a 5-0 win to liverpool. This is simply nonsense, what a game
Liverpool midfield and CB is the problem. I dont how more obvious that can be after this game.
리버풀은 답이없네 ㅎㅎ.....no solutions for liverpool ^^
😩Klopp definitely showed his stubbornness traits in this game as he decided to go with the same approach that lost him the CL final against Madrid last season. And most Liverpool fans think he’s the best choice in the long run🙃yeah right. It’s obvious this man doesn’t have the ability to evolve or adjust tactics when it’s needed and necessary. It’s time for him to go.
Everyone was slipping. 🤣🤣
Who needs cr7 anymore lol
liverpoop
Liverpool out
Still waiting for Salah's revenge!🤡🤣🤣
Someone should call the police because Liverpool's defending is criminal.
All my friends r barca= messi fans n they were laughing at me when madrid was down 2 = 0  I told 'em it was fine we r The remontadas club! N then this happened!🤩🤍 after that they were to quiet!🔇🤣🤣🤡
Coming from a Barca Fan, Noone does it like Madrid. They ooze class. I fail to understand how Madrid even works. They don't have to be in form to beat literally any club in the world. They make Anfield and Munich look like a walk in the park. This is madness. I truly believe they are the greatest club to ever exist.  Having Madrid as an arch rival has to be the utmost form of pride and respect for Barca. People still think Madrid get lucky. 14 CLs is not lucky. It is the testament to the Madrid DNA, to their unbelievable composure in big moments, to their unbreakable mentality.
Why do any other teams even bother scoring first against Real? We all know what happens when Real trail…its never good for the opposition.
Modric cruise for the 5th goal was just unbelievable and even the pass from vinicius to benzema in between the two defender us just a proof of Vinicius’s quality and importance. His game has matured a lot. Well done
Sniff sniff around here smells like 15th
Alisson saw that Courtois mistake and really said YNWA channeling his inner Karius what a true Red
Magic 🪄 of anfield
Klopp can't replace the old legs in the MF. Gomez is a done deal as a CB, I supported him before but no more as his mistakes are very detrimental. Klopp made a mistake and thought that after leading 2/0, he could score more. It is RM, daaah.
Vini needed one more gowp
And they to play Man Utd
Hala Modric. Another legend
2-0 comeback at ANFIELD of all places ffs…….. wild stuff
Hyped goalkeepers change both goalkeepers
Watching LFC get destroyed on home soil is glorious.
the announcers almost orgasm at Liverpool goals and bearly even react to Madrid goals. theses English announcer's are trash
Vini help the team on the come back and big benz finish the game for the team! 🎉
What a shitshow!
Vinicius never gives up... He is better than Mbappé
I like how Real Madrid dismantled Liverpool.
As a Real Madrid, a lot of us need to apologize to Banzema for the many criticisms he got from us when Ronaldo was on the team. This guy is truly amazing and a great a player. His consistency is beyond amazing. #HALAMARDRID🔥🔥
Pitch looks slippery..Lots of players were slipping..
This time Ramos didn’t injured Salah 😂😂😂😂
madrid need a new keeper and defense 😭
real madrid id gonna win champions league
What an absolute thrashing. As a fcb fan I wanted Liverpool to win but left very impressed with real madrids dominating performance. It’s their competition
Hala Madrid!!
Most teams that are down 2-0 look defeated and struggle get back on their feet but Real Madrid always pushes forward and gets the win no matter what.
liverpool got destroyed
“Watch the 2nd leg is Liverpool’s leg” “Nah Imma watch the aggregate score be 10-2”
Salah was absent
"That's why I'm easy come easy go...little high little low." - Freddie Mercury
Sloppy goals all over the place
Militao nearly injured himself after that goal
I don’t care who wins as long as Alexander Arnold looses ❤❤❤
Sheesh
Those refs always helping real madrid. First goal was a clear offside
I think” now Liverpool know who is RMA”  And Liverpool fans too😅
vinicius jr is just a runner. nothing else. stop pretending this is interesting football to watch when it makes football into track
Poor Liverpool they don’t know what is coming
How close is Benzema to being top 3 goal scorer of champions league?
Madrid is just godly I’m proud to be a madrista
Liverpool sucks this year.
Honestly expected this Liverpool had been playing bad in the premier league.. i dont even think they can beat the teams in europa league 💀
I hate how players are sok involved Ed in betting shenanigans. The goal keeper mistake was forced and not realistic. I keep seeing refs and players doing bullshit at a record amount of times. Fuck I stopped watching this game after that.  Back to mma. Fuck this.
I love how these English commentators pretended to be unbiased but end up getting butt hurt when Madrid whoops there English teams. ❤❤❤❤❤
Why didnt Arnold follow Militao…he was marking him and just saw him get away without even trying to follow smh
Masterclass
I’m a chelsea fan, and I already knew the result but what are Liverpool doing still starting joe Gomez😂.
Weird a lot of goalkeeping mistakes against Madrid the past years.
Ancellotti came, he saw, conquered. Winning vs a team with best zone defense in the world . I am wow, that coach is a God walking among us!
Did the commentator want to make it any more obvious that he was a Liverpool fan?
Benzema want the CL again 😮
It's obvious that klop is forced to play Gomez. And every single time, it ends bad for liverpool. I say make fabinho a cb and play milner cdm
how has ea given benzema 80 pac hes so fast real life
Siempre Madrid!!
Gomes - Man of the match
Is it me or vini only knows how to finish in big games 💀
The last goal was solidifying Kingship, damn!  Liverpool’s defense looked like a crime scene.
Man, imagine how much shit a normal every day person is capable of by having whatever kind of mentality Real Madrid players have when they're down on a champions league game. If these players can do this where "nothing is written" but they make it look like the norm as of late? I want even just 1/10th of it.
They need to sprinkle the field less, the players were falling down so much
real Madrid's composure and ability not to panic is really good
When it comes to high leverage games ain't many as good as real.
This Real team is so much fun to watch. Unreal stuff.
Vinicius absolutely tore Liverpool a new one! It was fun while it lasted lads #YNWA
Imagine if tchouameni was there
Modric getting applauded at Anfield at 37 years of age. Gem of a midfielder!
That first goal from Vinicius🤢🤢🤢, but Liverpool played so poorly and bad😂😂😂
Time for Alison to go. He made lots of error.
Must've been really slippery lol
As a lifetime liverpool fan they got absolutely outplayed in every aspect in the second half. No excuses for that disastrous performance.
Al Ahly of Egypt performed better than Liverpool against Real Madrid. Lol😂
Maybe the Barcelona radio talk shows are going to trash Vinicius Jr for scoring and celebrating his goals 😂
Vini this game was absolutely mental. Man of the match by far for this one
Great game
What did anyone else expect?  La Liga team has spent the past 2 decades beating up LFC like a mangy dog.  How is Klopp still coaching this team is beyond reason.  In La Liga Klopp would've been shown the door long ago.
Too many players slipped on this field lol
Gomez was the best Madrid player on the field
Poor salah 😄😄 now he’s going to cry behind his door like a little kid 🤣🤣🤣
Comeback kings
Salah and nunez are ass lol
Joe Gomez just dropped an all-time stinker in a Liverpool shirt. Madrid just ran through him and he made one crucial mistake after another. Madrid just ate them alive in their own backyard and it became pretty sad to watch after a while.
When you think you are gonna get a clean sheet against Real Madrid then you get battered.
Everybody laughs at Karius, everyone is Karius
Liverpool are well and truly in the mud.
Hell. I think Modric deserves another Ballon d'Or. How does he only have one...?
lmao the keepers
Real Madrid are the REAL thing.....again....LFC, smacked, again
Liverpool will go again ❤. But Real Madrid played brilliantly today.
Trent Alexander's marking on the Eder Militao goal is shocking
Liverpool are absolutely the biggest joke in European football and Klopp is the biggest joke of a manager
Real Madrid woke up and chose violence
Karius would be an upgrade on Alisson
They say Trent’s defending is the worst in the club but He, Robertson and van djik are all good defenders they need to be on the same page
Goals are goals no matter how weird they are. Strange game
I’m so glad the team rallied, redeemed Coutious and won.
How is Liverpool's defense so bad
Well, that's what happens when a team decides a 2-0 lead against Real Madrid is more than enough with 70 minutes to go.  Liverpool took their feet entirely off the pedal and RM took advantage and humiliated them.  Gotta give them credit for taking the initiative and deciding the game really is 90 minutes long.  Liverpool's minds left the stadium at the 20 minute mark and they paid dearly.
Looks like Jude Bellingham knows which he's joining now
liverpool fans were getting a little cocky after the first two goals. I'm glad Madrid took care of that real quick
Liverpool played just incredibly sloppy, and has been for whole season now. Real did ok but they were very shaky for first 30 min of the game and I doubt they would've won if Liverpool's defense wasn't so horrible
EPL not exactly showing out in the Champions League so far. Man City is their only hope
That third goal is sick…  Let me just hide behind Arnold who doesn’t defend…
How is that of Scoring 5 when they trail by 2!!
Liverpool denfense very weak  As Chelsea fan I’m proud we knock them out once .
Salah never passes lmao. Look how much gold Madrid got because their wingers pass the ball. Love seeing Liverpool in shambles
WHY IS NO ONE QUESTIONING HOW SLIPPERY PITCHES HAVE BEEN THIS ISN'T THE ONLY GAME WITH A LOT OF TRIPPING WHAT IS GOING ON
wow!
Hala Madrid!!
LIVERPOOL 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Liverpool vs Real Madrid always produces a great game for neutrals
12 man anfield my hairline just imagine when it 10-2 at the bernebeau at aggregate
Real Madrid is my Daddy  Liverpool Futbol Club
I am impressed with how Real Madrid play in the Champions League.  Down 2-0 in the road most teams will lose confidence or get too desperate in attack compromising the defense.  Real stay composed and kept fighting.
the commentators are so biased ahaha
Can someone remind modric he is 37yrs old? He is playing like he is 25
If the last English-Spanish game of Barca v United was one of the best games in recent times, then this was definitely the weirdest one 🤷🏻‍♂️
To beat RM don't score them 1st  UCL is their blood no joke 🔥🔥
Respect to Luka Madric ❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😊
Parsimony bites Liverpool and Fenway in the goal.
Reminds me of Liverpool 2 - 7 Villa from a couple years ago. Nothing went right for them, and the mistakes they made were easily punished. Men against boys out there.
English commentary is just sad I’m sorry
Both keepers need to forget this game ever happened
I don’t know what’s shocking; Darwin scoring or both goalkeepers playing like shit today
And in my book this is a 4-1 game, both goalkeepers gave away gimmes. 15 minutes in Liverpool was higher than a than. A crackhead
As a Liverpool fan Allison need to retire 😢
Man! I see great things for that lad Lucas Modric!!
2:17 salah with his selfish ways. Salah deserve to lose.
After those 2 goals, Madrid put on an absolute masterclass. That’s how you play football.
I know everyone will be talking about Madrid but that Darwin Nunez goal was gorgeous
I hope Klopp canceled his reservation in Istanbul 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The problem with Liverpool is after they score 1 or 2 goals they stop playing they think the other team will not get up but this is Real Madrid totally different animal that the ones ones on the Premiership
Moooooooo SaaaaaaLaaaah, Running down the wing😂😂😂
Modric has to be on an all time list somewhere
This was a ass beating dished and handed to loserpool, the boys were ole’ing in the middle of anfield 🤣🤣🤣
Klopp sacked 100 percent
Liverpool needs to retool and refresh their team. Time to sell Salah, Keita, Robertson, TAA, Gomez, Fabinho, and Replace Klopp
Remember this game, this will be the game that signaled Liverpool is back to being Sheit.
Great comeback! Love Real Madrid!!
Legend has it that the players are still slipping on the pitch, even now.
Vini  🔥🔥
Joe gomez is possibly responsible for all the goals
Real Madrid are just above and beyond any other club.
0:42 Nunes goal 2:37 Salah goal 4:07 Vini Goal 6:25 vini goal 9:16 Militao goal 10:26 benzama goal 12:58 benzama goal
Just like last season, Real Madrid is a Zombie. Dead but not really dead!
I wanted to laugh at my friends (Liverpool fans), but for some reason I can't
HALA MADRID
Madrid are the comeback kings ong
Una salvajada lo del Real Madrid 💕
Yes madrid scored 5 but to the madrid fans dont get too excited just yet. Not taking anything away from your team but lets not forget liverpool is struggling. Regardless, a win is a win congrats from a Barcelona supporter 👏
Real Madrid is Soccer : learn
Absolute rubbish from Liverpool. We start the game well then our defense played careless THERES NO NEED TO PLAY POSSESSION IN THE BACK WHILE THE OPPOSITION IS PRESSING WHEN YOUR UP 2-0. what’s going on Liverpool?
Ancelotti went back to Anfield to whoop some Merseyside ass
You will never walk alone, Real Madrid will show you the path.
Liverpool humilliated yet again by there dad real madrid owns the whole premier league too
Liverpool is small club with no history/glory compared to the all mighty Real Madrid. Today was just a practice session for Real Madrid. Good warm up for la liga game coming up
No one has told Modric he's 37 😂😂😂
You couldn't upload this is HD? Lol it's 2023 guys, cmon
Real Madrid DESTROYED Liverpool 🤍🔥 See you in the next leg at the Bernabeu
🇪🇸 🇪🇸 💯 💪
People still compare modric to Iniesta
Klopp said, they gave away five goals and this is best game of the season for Liverpool.
One season wonder Salah 😂 honestly at this point let’s just get him in Madrid to see what it’s like to play at the top levels
Madrid owned Liverpool 😢
Liverpool's Spirit of Defense went downhill very quickly in the second half , gotta pick up the pace and lift your energies boys !
Hala Madrid!! Viva Espana!! 🇪🇸
Commentator is so boring😭😭
L Liverpool, losing to the best team in the world again. SUIIIII
the tone change of the commentators when liv vs rma score is hilarious
nah madrid didn’t fuck around after going down 2-0 😭😭
When you have Harry as s goalie
Glad goalies like ederson, Allison etc are getting exposed for being carried by their teams, rather than their ability to save a shot😂🤷🏾‍♂️
When Real Madrid playing Champion he always tried to do his best more than hundred percent to win the game hala madrid...
I like how they included that little tiki taka on Elliot at the end. XD
Van dijk’s fall off is crazy. Went from the best defender in the world, top 3 on a balon d’or list to young M.A
A game for both goalkeepers to forget lol
Hala madrid y nada mas. Vamos.
I feel like Jurgen Klopp won’t be liverpools manager by the end of this season
Alison told courtois ' you won't walk alone ' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The premier league is finished.
if you're winning 2-0 against Madrid - trust me ... SCORE TWO MORE - DONT STOP ! DESTROY THEIR SPIRIT
Seeing Loserpool take a huge L puts a huge smile on my face, what a good day 😌
This proves Yassine Bounou is the best goalkeeper in the world!!
Thanks vinicius and bemzema made me winning 1,224 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂hala Madrid ❤
English teams being humbled by the Spanish king Real Madrid like always I love it 😂😂
These goalkeepers getting paid millions to do stupid shit like this
If mane were her ❤😅
Match of the season no doubt.
whenever the opposition gets posession van dijk just races to the goal line so he doesn't miss a challenge, can't miss any if you don't try for any. van dijk so smart
Suck defense of Liverpool and no one wanted to move
Embarrassing
It was over for Liverpool when they let Vinicius get one back, they just need one goal to get their confidence even if they are behind in the game.
No Mané, no party 🎈 😂
Vini and rashford who you guys think is better overall?
With Mané ,liverpool is ruthless without him they're toothless . Liverpool won champions league with Mane and they will be on championship  without him.
Is Luka Modric 37 or 27??? I don’t even know anymore 😭😭
What a heart break for Liverpool fans! They thought they wining
VINIIIIIIIII
15:39 No way Real just turned the game into a training drill
This went from :), to lol, to lmao, to lmfao.
Not a fan of either team, but it's great hearing English commentators get all excited and then slowly watch their team get ripped to shreds.
Gomez is awful. It never looks like he is even trying. That is the part that is inexcusable.
The right side of liverpool defense shambles. Trent cant defend at all, Gomez is not tight enough on players and robertson was okay but needed to be more consistent, VVD couldve had a better performance. The younger in the midfield needs more playtime and know when to pass to dribble; on the vini second goal the young liv player need to play the way he was facing just pass it back and reset... Good comeback of Real Madrid. Liverpool did good first 20mins of the first half
Hala Madrid. Was expecting more from Liverpool, but they've been rubbish in defense especially. At least Nunez finally scored one!🤣🤣🤣
First Atletico Madrid, Then Real Madrid. Welcome to Anfield, indeed. That was an Anal Rape to Liverpool. Their fans must be really salty. 😂. Vinicious Jr and Benzema. What great players.
If Napoli won’t win it this year, I truly hope Real Madrid win it again!  🤍 That said, #ForzaNapoliSempre 💙
Klopp’s angry and sarcastic clapping after Allison’s error😮
Hala Madrid!!! Premiere League can't compete
Liverpool need to humble themselves to the real European king 👑 bow down loser pool. We own you clowns 🤡 you choked 2 finals against us and now this lol
Wow.. thoughts and prayers for Liverpool fans. 🙏🏽
There was as so much excitement on that first Real Madrid goal by the announcer.
Real is just built different lol and Modric is still unbelievable wow...
Watching liverpool lose at anfield is my preferred dopamine hit
When I watched this game live bro it was crazy it was like every time I blink there is  a goal
I’m waiting for no mo
Liverpool owners 😂
Those fireworks worked
2:20 he’s wide open
Modric is such a gem
Both teams sorry goal keepers
Hala Madrid siempre fieles 🤍💜🤍💜🤍💜
What a beautiful ⚽️from Madrid...This recipes from Vinicius & Benzema is mixed with Pele & Zidane 💪🏿
Man how tf does Modric still have that kind of energy? The man's longevity is legendary.
Madrid may come up short with performances. But they NEVER come up short when it comes to mentality. They will drain their opponents mentally.
How come i could hear the Madrid Spanish commentator in the background?
hahahahahahahahahahaha
Whats???
It is official, Liverpool will now be calling Real Madrid DADDY. (Anfield board members)
Real better. The 5th goal will be studied in Universities 😂
Real Madrid can single handedly thank Gomez for that aggregate today
Y’all still think alison better than ederson? Lmaoo
Vini is turning out to be a fine player. He is scoring in crucial games and that's the most important part
Bajcetic defending on the last goal is awful. No desire to stop the goal
As a Real Madrid incha I Come here and laugh right on the face of every single EPL fan hahaha 😂
Would’ve been 7-2 just like Barca game if there field wasn’t so slippery
Im sick and tired of liverpool revenge salahs revenge bro like stfu
Insane game
Love seeing the world back to normal. Liverpool is shite :D
CBS and NBC highlights are 15 minutes long, while Fox highlights are 5 minutes long.
Did people really believe Liverpool would beat Real Madrid??😂😂😂I’ll never understand why the greatest and most successful soccer team of all time is so slept on😂😂
Madrid is struggling to score in La Liga just completely ripped Liverpool's defense apart. Liverpool's defense should do some soul-searching. I have not see them this bad, probably ever.
My favorite part was when LiVARscum were 2-0 up and lost 2-5 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Madrid owns Liverpool at this point
Liverpool is useless
You're delusional if you thought this version of Liverpool was going to beat Madrid, The Madrid??? 🤣🤣
Bro 5 unanswered goals? Liverpool are in the Mud
Modric was superb.
Joe Gomez is useless. TAA as always playing weak defense. Absurd
Oh man watching this game live was insane. My buddy is a Liverpool die hard fan and he's currently asleep in my house passed out drunk. I make fun of him time to time when Liverpool loses but today I just gave him a hug. That was brutal to watch even when I was a nuetral fan.
In towards Gakpo!!! It's Darwin Nunez!!!
As a City supporter it kinda sucks seeing Liverpool lose this bad abroad.
Liverpool’s season is getting worse
This is how I lose in all my Fut champ games. 2-0 up to 5-2 down
Did anyone really thing any other out come would happen
Y’all ever noticed once Madrid beats once twice or more    You in never losing cycle  Examples  2014,2015,2016,2018  Madrid pounded atlético no matter how many times they tried  2014,2017,2018  Madrid pounded Bayern Munich no matter how many times they tried  And now 2015,2018,2021,2022,2023  Madrid is been pounding Liverpool no matter how many times they tried   I honestly wonder who’s our next victim? Man city? Psg? Chelsea? Dortmund?
Los Reyes de Europa
Fun fact: during live betting, Real’s odds of winning increased after going 0-2
On a positive note for Liverpool, Darwin Nunez is starting to come good.
Hala Madrid!
What happened to Liverpool, and what happened to both keepers screwing things up?wow. Crazy game, but RM just knew how to come back after That 2 gol loss.
Trent’s defending for Militaos goal 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Credit to the referee for the free flow
I don't like either team, but I take great pleasure in seeing Liverpuke losing.
great goals
Imagine starting guy named Cody Gakpo against Real Madrid in UCL
You Madrid will let you score first just make you their b**** after hahah HALA Madrid
Liverpool rinsed
Real Madrid are just different in the champions league
Salah needs to pass the ball more lmao
Real Madrid hace magia una vez más 🤍
Some unlucky deflections, 50/50s, Gomez was atrocious.
Madrid is the ultimate UCL team.
Liverpool is lost they need to go get Sadio Mané back😂 Salah can’t do nothing without him and he was a Good help for the defense especially for Robertson. Real Madrid playing like it was a training Damn that’s a shame liverpool 😂😂😂
KLOPP is out of new ideas  and a good  strikers as Sadio Mané...he needs to remodel Liverpool and buy a real striker   as  Osimhen of #Napoli ..
That goal by Darwin thou...
Vini is a beast man
Salah: I’m gonna get my revenge 👴🏻
ESPNFC, learn how a top media is crafting highlights.
Modric Masterclass
Oh lukitaa
Damn this y’all team? Liverpool? 🤣🤣 I’d rather be second division team fanboy 💀
This commentator is a liverpool fan ong
⭐ 5 months 2 days after Queen Elizabeth's burial, like 52 Liverpool lose 5-2 to Real Madrid on the 52nd day of the year falling to 5W 2L in the Champions League this season, like 52 Karim = 52 Liverpool = 52 Jürgen Klopp = 52 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEMJTLJGHK8
salah ain’t gone like this one
Liverpool is struggling
What a goal by Nunez tho!!
The commentator didn’t put the required energy on the game. Peter Drury would do better.
Today the Liverpool fans walked alone. 😂😂😂
Real Madrid is the king of Europe.
Benz 2nd goal van dyke left him open and should of marked him instead of going to the goal
Only got to watch the first half and I didn't expect this scoreline when I came to watch the highlights
Ayo chill At least Salah settled his ‘goal’
When will people give Real Madrid the respect they deserve?
Now that's the Liverpool I've been accustomed to seeing this season. Knew that Newcastle win was a fluke.
I love Gomez but I think the commentator is right..he shouldn’t have turned his back on that shot.  Benzema was shaping up for a finesse shot (not a hard shot) with his weaker foot. A defender has to be braver.
Modric almost 37 years old running and playing much better than salahmin.....
El hermano mayor del poderoso AME ganó señores.
Look, I am a Barca fan who luvs Neymar but Vinny is the best Brazilian player in the world today. He is almost unstoppable, I adore watching him play as it reminds me of Ney when he played for Barca. Vinny, Fede, Tchouameni, Rodrygo, and Camavinga  for the 2020s🔥🔥🔥.
Now BARCa will have a different experience on Thursday. GG Madrid... A man u fan
The real madrid goal keeper's village people were on him. They remembered him today. Allison always committing blunder lol
Modric was brilliant beating the press and making recovery run in defense unreal for his age
Greatest of all time Real Madrid🤍🤍
I'm always amazed at how uncomfortable pro goalkeepers are on the ball. Looked like me out on Sunday pick up
As a MAN U fan this brings joy to my heart 🥲
The greatest comeback of 2023
Well done boys 👍🏼😂😂😂
"Where's it next season? Istanbul? Book the hotel" - Jurgen Klopp
Bruh, Liverpool doesn't exist without starting with an L.
2-5😹
Fantastic
Such a great gol Darwin y en El mundial no levanstates las gambas 🇺🇾🇺🇸
Yea Real Madrid did good as a whole this game, but be honest Vini Jr was MOTM, they couldn’t have done it without him. 2 goals and an assist. Just wow.🔥🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷
Vinicius jr is who English media thinks rashford and saka are
A great man once said “Eras do come to an End!!!!
😂😂😂loserpool
Veni, vedi, vici ⚔️🗡️Hala!
Don't wake up a giant sleepy 😴..ding dong Liverpool 🤣🤣
Can we talk about how bad Allison is ? It's not the first time he made that stupid mistake
Looserpool 😂
Liverpool look all over the place ain't going nowhere fast
Well, Liverpool really missed Sadio Mane. Karma....
Now that's an anfield miracle
I’m sorry but Joe Gomez is horrible
Fair play to Allison … Since Courtios gave Liverpool a free goal , Allison have to do it so is even .. Fair play …
The premier league is not living up to the best league in the world moniker.
Vinicius Junior is the one carrying Real Madrid in the toughest of games. He’s their best player by far.
Courtois going back to his 2020 ways it seems
Liverpool got midfield issues plus, for next season, they need to create competition in the GK and defensive positions.
i love the Rudiger and Militao duo, the two big boys 🦾
What was with the fields. Everyone was kept slipping
Joe Gomez has to go.
Anfield? more like Anal-filed. Real owns Liverpool
Bajetic absolutely packs it in on the Benzema goal. That mentality is why Liverpool is underachieving. Their defenders, Van Dijk included, have been doing it all season. One too many hugs, perhaps.
Milito trying to slide 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Brilliant game. Thats it.
Liverpool fans should be ashamed of themselves for blowing fireworks at the hotel where the Madrid players stayed last night. No wonder they didn’t let them in the stadium in Paris last year. If you act like a clown l, don’t be surprised if you get treated like one.
Pobre liverpool antes daba miedo y ahora da lastima.   😁😄😃😅😂🤣  Le faltó llevar su toper porque le dieron hasta para llevar 😁😄😃😅😂🤣
Allison had a Karius moment today 😭
damn this was a badass game, top games of the year so far
So Real Madrid could have won 5-1 just saying  Hala Madrid
Liverpool needs to go and bring Sadio Mane back to this team
Liverpool thought they passed the Karius curse onto Madrid until football heritage hit Allison 😂😂😂
Duele a quien le duela REAL MADRID es el mejor del mundo
all liverpools players were soft
Respect to Real Madrid. They're the best
Salah has always been a peace of shit player, Mane had him score most of his goals with good assists
This only tells how EPL is weak, period
Why was everyone slipping?
i’ve got too say it joe gomez is the worst defender i’ve ever seen in my life, he makes maguire look good
Man Nunez has pace, he’s a good talent all he needs is time and good training, needs to be a better finisher and get better first touches, he already has pace and height. He could definitely be a deadly striker if he gets himself straight
The midfield and defense of Liverpool is weak to say the least.
This is not a surprise real Madrid are kings of Europe
Why players keep sliding ⛷️ 😂
Sad to see but Fabinho is just a liability in there. Madrid are just on another level in this competition. Hard to see Liverpool turning the result around
This game is basically a summary of how Liverpool's season has gone, as soon as they show signs of being the Liverpool that so nearly won the title last season, their inconsistency rears its ugly head and they squander a potentially huge win.
This was a spanking.😭💀
Two finals now a 5 goals unanswered at home, Real Madrid really father Liverpool 😂
It is high time for Klopp to say goodbye. His obsession with Gomez is really foolish given the fact that Gomez always play a prominent role in every Liverpool loss. You look at this kind of an idiot of a player and you extend his contract to four years.  The entire Liverpool squad needs an overhaul. Sadio Mane was the steel in that squad, and he was the fittest at the time of sale. Liverpool couldn’t just add a million dollar more to keep him but they could keep the likes of Chamberlain, Keita and Gomez. Bad business.
The bias from the commentators is so bad! Just listen to the reaction difference from both teams.
This shite makes FIFA 23 look realistic.
Liverpool frustrates me and I'm not even a Liverpool fan. Like how are they going to throw a 2-0 lead and really badly
Anybody noticed that the field was slightly slippery
“Prem the best league in the world” Milan 1-0 Spurs, Dortmund 1-0 Chelsea, Liverpool 2-5 Madrid 💀
This commentator always bias n suckin English teams even wen they losing
I bet on Madrid when they were losing. Moneyyyyy
Modric being 38 amazes me how much energy and class he brings to the field.
Football heritage.
The one time Darwin should've missed, man actually scored 🤣
Vini monster 👿
I don't like Real Madrid but damn they know how to win and they are the Champions of Champions league. They have something I can't explain. Hope Man City gets revenge this year
Naaaahhhh💀
i started laughing once the 4th went in.. its not even disappointing atp..
Liverpool been trash this year I didn’t expect anything from Liverpool 😂😂😂
Time to fire the manager and get rid of some players. Start from scratch.
Madrid completely dominated Liverpool. they were toying with them in their own backyard and could’ve easily put 7 past them
People have to understand that Liverpool is capable or scoring, but they really struggle when they don't have the ball. Both to retrieve and defend. I really thought it wouldn't be a complete slam. I was expecting Real Madrid to win 3-2. Not 5-2. As a Real Madrid fan I'm still excited to see what both teams will do in the 2nd leg.
Modric playing for the team is 🔥🐐
Nunez finally scored
Rip Jurgen Klopp
They look like deer seeing headlight absolute rubbish pitcher for Liverpool
A middle of the pack EPL team faces a top La Liga team which also happens to be the king of UCL.   What can go wrong?
madrid can beat you in many ways. such a versatile team. can keep the ball when they need to, counter when they need to,  oh you want end to end football? they can give u that also. really really tough team to defeat (especially in tournaments)
Imagine being a liverpool fan who lives in a town that mostly supports the dallas cowboys.. and the stars who are on a skid.. oh boi...
Premier League fans always talk shit about La Liga teams and yet when it comes to European competitions, the Spanish teams always put them in their place. Bravo Real Madrid!
At some point Klopp will have to admit not keeping Sadio Mane was a mistake.
HALA MADRID Y NADA MÁS
Most realistic fifa game
Liverpool are out of the Champions League
Alisson is ass
just goes to show, yall were way too hard on karius
EPL teams are getting dominated in this knockout, maybe they got used to playing against midtable teams from England 😂
Guess we need to pay Salah more and start Joe Gomez every game.
😂😂😂😂 Real Madrid CEO of Liverpool
Christ on a Cracker!
Modric on that run. Insane. He NEEDS to receive another 1 year contract minimum!
Militoa celebration was the best 😁😄
Benz assassinated Allison with that last goal 😭
Thoughts Liverpool fans?
This was absolutely insane
Arnold just let militao run straight for the ball to score that header lol. Dude was like fk it
Rovar Madrid forever
no karius and we still get smoked. 5 unanswered goals at home (let alone anfield), disheartening. madrid in UCL is just an insane team to watch. at least darwin got a nice one🥲
I thought I was seeing Karius as gk💀
Real Madrid players didn't hold the trophy for long enough last time they won the UCL title, so they've decided to make a statement by crushing Liverpool (whom they defeated in the final last year) at Anfield. Seriously, next time Real win the title, UEFA should let them keep the cup and come up with a new trophy design, because the current one has the club's name on it!
Vini pulled a benzema
Bin dippers getting ABSOLUTELY TONKED. 🥴😂😂
LMFAO!
as always. again and again. barca and liver fans have a good night.
Vinicius was cooking Liverpool’s defense😭😭
On the day I was busy and couldn’t place my bet😭😭😭
Pornhub ❤
Maybe one day they'll put their pride aside and give all respect due to SADIO MANE! Go and watch all the times Liverpool have played against Real Madrid with Sadio Mane on their side
Liverpool is just an illusion. You think they are good, but they are not. They are just random winners sometimes.
LiverPOOP
hehehe. EPL, eh?
Had they awarded that clear hand ball penalty to Liverpool, they wouldn’t have lost their mind and would have been a different result…
Ala Madrid ! Kings of Europe
Literally men against boys sheesh
Vamos güey
Alison = Karius 2.0 lol
Love watching these big English teams lose, their fans are so annoying
HALA MADRID WHAT A ROLLER COASTER
I like how Gomez just looks at the ball ,he has to go!
It's rare to see a mistake from a world class keeper. It's even more rare when it happens twice to two different world class keepers
Real Madrid and Champions League is a long love story. Hard to explain but there are always something special about it.
Real Madrid show more than any other team, possibly in any sport in the world, how important mentality is. down 0-2, they don't panic and keep playing their game. and then Vinicius creates a goal from nothing and they become even more aggressive. on the other side, as soon as Vinicius scores, Liverpool gets nervous. all the times Real Madrid have come back start creeping into the back of their minds. and then a mistake from Alisson sends them into free fall and they lose 2-5.
I know Liverpool love throwing, but I didn't know that bad
we playing wit these guys 💀
madrid got that champions league fear factor, nobody wants to see them even if their up
bruh Bruh Bruh Bruh
Simple yet effective gameplan: attack Liverpool on their right side. Works every time. Also still hard to believe Modric is 37
RM fan.. it’s not over.. we haven’t been playing too well this year. I agree we are different in CL but injuries and drop in form is killing us in liga. I still feel like Liverpool is a really dangerous team. I love carvajal but shit I’d take Trent any day lol  Madrid fans don’t give me shit I’m just calling how I see it. Nobody in their right minds thought we’d come back and score 5 unanswered goals in England by the way we’ve been playing along with our injuries.
Very Embarrassing,This Salah Got 1 Good Season....Liverpool's Legends Say He's Better Than Messi And Ronaldo,Disgusting Liverfools👹
bruh Bruh Bruh
Sorriest goalkeeper ever
Good to see the Uruguayan Andy Caroll score a goal 😂😂😂 100M I hear he costs…
What happened to “we have a score to settle “? 😂😂😂
English teams doing English things. No surprise here
Reyes de Europa!!! That is the explanation.
Hala Madrid
Same like last season for RM. Stay on course and keep pushing. 🤷‍♂️
THIS IS ANFIELD
I told you Vini changed the game Ever the best of his generation
Madrid owned them
I thought PSG defense was the worst
Just Wow...
wow what a goal
SALAH...IN TOWARDS GAKPOOO...ITS DARWIN NUNEZ...  ROFL
This was a bizarre game for sure. Glad RM pulled it off, I wonder what this means for Klopp and this Liverpool squad.
Im a barca fan but Real Madrid are just to good for ucl
LP wanted to rage quit after the 4th goal
Liverpool doesn’t have top class players
Surprised to not see Asencio playing
1:06 Klopp knew from that moment they fked up by waking up the giant early on by scoring so early.
0:41 'In toward GAKPOOOOOOO!!!'... now that's some confusing commentary there, Clive.
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAH TAKE THAT LIVARSHIT HAHAHAHHAHAH 5-2 DARWIN NUNEZ JAJAJJAJAJJAJAJJAJAJJAJA HAHAHAH
Liverpool has a thing with Goalkeeper errors while playing real Madrid in champions
For the record, losing 5-2 at home after leading 2-0 is far more embarrassing than conceding twice in a minute and losing 2-1 away. So go and banter a club that deserves it.
Love seeing Madrid clobber premier league teams lol although I love Man U.
Ripped to shred, couldn't say it better.
Modric plays like with the energy of a 20 year old!!! give this man an extension because I love watching him play 🔥
10:09 Modric defending so good he even stopped eders celebrations 🤣🤣
Glad to see the referee at least warning the defenders when they play hard on Vini, unlike in La Liga.
Can somebody tell me for that 5th goal how a 37yr old pass their prime modric just outrun a prime 29yr old Fabinho😤 fabinho looks like he’s the one who’s 37 and modric is 29
Just love to see Liverpool getting destroyed at home lmao.
Courtoius with the biggest knees in the champions league
Liverpool sucks man
Gotta love the players who don't celebrate the ones who assisted them the goal
Yikes
0:51 ya no les anote más 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
England and their club teams always know how to bottle it in major games don’t they?
Real Madrid is Liverpool's daddy let's just be honest, they have a mental hold on Liverpool.
Missing the Sané effect
Si carajo !!! Ha por todo !! Mas lucha y mas corazón !! Esfuerzo y calidad !!! Ha por todo !!!🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
How Modric out runs Fabino and an 18 year old for the 5 goal is crazy to me 🔥 Hala Madrid
PK for Argentina!!
Gomez should be playing for nothingham forest . Never got Liverpool … Anderson is old enough and should work as only substitute
Everyone wants to play agianst Liverpool
Bravo REAL
real madrid does worse than some la liga team but against liverpool they score 5 goals against them liverpool is so bad this season screwing up a 2 goal lead
I love quite literally everything about this. Craziest sequence of events in this match. We love to see Liverpool fall apart like this.
The 20 years old Luka modrick
Liverpool struck again by the Madrid curse lol
I can’t believe what I just watched, this is what happens when you talk too much. They listen, and they answer!! Thank you Real Madrid 🙏🏾 silence this club for good we can’t stand it anymore
Premier league fans thinking others league are farmers 🤡
Super Nacho, Hi make the deference!
What a comeback from us  Hala Madrid 🇪🇸 👑
Loving Liverpool downfall they deserve it🤡
Madrid owns Liverpool bruh
Luck on Real’s side, but horrible from Liverpool.
Liverpool’s attack look fine, but midfield needs to be improved
Selling Mane was a huge mistake
Barca fan but Madrid is a champions league demon, Barcelona or psg wouldn’t have come back from a 2-0 like that, every team fears bayer but I sure bayer fears Real Madrid
Nunez actually scored, dam, what a miracle
Noice
If This Was Manchester United😂😂😂😂Life Is Funny The World Is Big But Its Very Small,Manchester United For Life👹👹👹👹👹👹💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💯💯💯💯💯
2:10 Gakpo vs Camavinga🔥🔥🔥
But but i thought EPL is the best league itw....
Starts Henderson, brings on Milner. Fireworks.   Game summary
Imagine if the away goal was in effect 😂
These English commentators are so biased and it shows 😂
It’s a trap 😂
Nobody is talking about the militao handball?
Again spanish teams dominating English teams 😅
Klopp after the 2022 Campions League loss to Real: "Where is the final next year? Book your hotels now."  Real: duly noted. 😑😑😑 Loved hearning how arrogant the English announcers were at the start and then they were awfully quite after 5 striaght goals.
Real Madrid owns Liverpool 😂😂
comeback moment real madrid
Idk why people making fun of Salah. He was literally they only one trying to do something for Liverpool.
It's amazing what the Afro Brazilians do at club level but nothing for their national team.  Cbf needs Ancelotti to coach them.  Great comeback for Madrid.
How the fuck do you go from 2 nil up to losing the game 5 2?!!?!!!???? Seriously wtf is wrong with Liverpool this season they're so so bad.
¡Hala Madrid!  4 life ❤
Literally gods team
no champions league next season for Liverpool
It was quiet up in thereeee
Time for Liverpool to pull a Chelsea this summer
Can Liverpool beat Real Madrid once under Klopp?
Gol gol gol gol gol gol !!! Real Madrid!! 🏆
Liverpool are not getting their revenge anytime soon Real Madrid are just different in the Ucl
That run from Modric for his age that was beast
Madrid is really on a different level in ucl
All that needs be said: y nada mas Y NADA MAS
Madrid teams own Liverpool, and supposedly the Prem is the best league in the world 😂😂
Is this the efootball commentary?😂😂
This is the Liverpool we love 😂
Predictions  https://youtu.be/A3ik038TT3U
12:46 modric has like a magnet in his foot amazing player best midfielder imo
It's a choice. Real Madrid chooses to lose or win.
Haha Madrid nada mas! 🤍💜
Liverpool was way better than Madrid, except Liverpool didn’t know how to defense.
Comeback kings
Modric has such good pausa in his game
Nothing to see here. Just Real Madrid continuing were they stopped last season. They love to go behind in the UCL to make comebacks.
Benzemas second goal, you can hear the Spanish commentator, Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
when real madrid has scored more goals in england in 2023 than chelsea
67 años nunca en mi vida e visto un mejor equipo que este Real Madrid
vicious vinicius
What a game! Huge goals, huge comebacks what can you say? Are we seeing a Liverpool comeback next in Bernabéu or leave it to Madrid and score more?
Oh my god...Klopp just got Klopped...
carlos ancelotti top top manager. Cool as can be while his GK makes a fool of himself to increase the deficit to 2-0😂 This team is really pacey, exciting, persistent, you have the older players but also young game changers. Just a all around well put together squad vs a team that’s the opposite.
I don't think I've ever seen a team crumble so fast like the reds did today. Shame
Fuck this biased commentator. Hala Madrid
The English commentary bias wow
Modric initial Hussle prior to 5th goal. Stuff of legends. Someone tell that guy he's 37 😂😂
Liverpool fans should stay tuned until 3:46 minutes.
😢😢
😢😢
Doesn't matter who wins!  All these players STANK in the past world cup!!! smdh!!
oh my god. I could not believe how this happened. The game almost felit like it was staged, and planned to happen. 7 goals in a tight match is crazy. 2nd leg will be rough for liverpool. Real Madrid have an easy second leg and i wouldnt be surpised if they rested players for that match. Just a terrible game for liverpool fans.
Madrid is obsessed with this competition
Comeback kings has done it again
Very nice of Madrid to let Liverpool score first
Real Madrid, the best club in football history
Keep messing with Real Madrid.
Epic loss for Liverpool that really showed where they're at. BenzeVini is brilliant. Nuff said!
ARNOLD LET MILITAO SCORE HAHAHAHAH
Madrid have elite knockout game mentality
Real Madrid play with SO MUCH PASSION. I love my team. VAMOOSSSS ❤️
Allison and Gomez had a shocker lol
Did they pay the RMA goalkeeper he let two goals in
Those were some of the worst goals I’ve seen at a professional level mixed with some of the best goals. Very strange game.
I will always maintain CR7 is “Mr champions league” because of Madrid. Any other team he would have 2 total UCL.
Madrid could be down 4 to fucking 0 at halftime and I would still have belief that they’ll come back. Best team ever. Kings of Europe, kings of futbol. They do this every single year shit is unbelievable
Hopefully liverpool didn’t book the hotel at Instabul
They never learn never underestimate the Kings of Europe throw stones at the throne at your own peril.
FORZA MADRID 🤍
HALA MADRID
Hala Madrid 🙌💪
these goalkeepers are on some crack
Probs to Nacho. He completely changed the defense for them when Alaba got injured. Salah was in his pocket since he came on.
real madrid thrive under pressure, kings for a reason, Also camavinga what a baller.
It's a tired statement, but the Champions League is truly Real Madrid's competition.
It’s always nice seeing a premier league team blow a lead.
I freaking love you Real Madrid ❤️
Modric was on 🔥🔥🔥 tonight
This is the reason why I always wait for the last whistle
Hala comeback 💪💪💪
My respect to the Liverpool fans. Never stopped supporting their team and respected the rival. We need more of that in la Liga.
Madrid own Liverpool 😹💀
These dudes really packed it in after going up 2-0.
What a scary team that is Real Madrid
MATCHFIXING???
Mbappe may look like a turtle but Vini looks like a toad
La Liga is the epl daddy
Modric is playing like he is 21.
Well.. that happened hahaha
I see Liverpool fans celebrated early with fireworks before the game for Real Madrid’s victory 😂🎇🎆
Real punished Liverpool for arrogance. Benzema is the best striker in the world; if he played in the 2023 World Cup, France would become the world champion.
Madrid did what Barca should’ve done
Levels to this PL fan boys. Real is the king and the rest are pissant peasants.
Liverpool came in hot but left frozen.
How is that possible Liverpool can do all this mistakes in one game?😅
top rated on bestgore
From 2-0 to 2-5 is crazy never expected Real Madrid to play this good I have NO words to say what I just witnessed
This is why they are 14 time champion league winners, and there’s always doubters to Madrid every game they play.
Madrid owns Liverpool cuz
2:53 Ancelotti starts chewing gum and the rest is history
not any team can play like real madrid in champions league 👍
Liverpool season summed up in this video.
Kings of Europe
i did not know they aloud murder videos in youtube. you learn something new evry day 🤣
Benzema is arguably the coldest player all time
Real Madrid completely outclassed Liverpool in the second-half!! They just have the genes of winning this competition!! If they manage to make it to be CL final again, I won’t be surprised!!
What a comeback, congratulation to RM. What is it that RM is unstoppable in the Champions League?
You never walk alone I guess 🥲
Hahhahaa Courtois you dumb giraffe. Lol
EPL is a overrated league because of media and Liverpool is midtable in that league. Did anyone in their right mind actually believe Shitpool could win except for biased English pundits who live in their EPL bubble. Never seen a team beaten so badly like Liverpool today.
Klopp needs to stop being stubborn like Wenger!! Why do I feel like he is slowly starting to become like Wenger?!
Ederson doesn't make those errors
Best team in the history of sports! Hala Madrid y Nada Mas!!🤍
Liverpool deserve this defeat!! They dropped their guard!!
Liverpool in the mud 😂😂😂😂😂 losing like that at home shameless
The way Trent just lets militao run away from him
Madrids comebacks are always inevitable 😂
Eerie to hear Anfield gradually get silent. Nobody just walks into Anfield and goes “I’ll take 5 unanswered goals, please”. Props to Real. Domination is in their DNA.
Nacho is genuinely such a class player. For the better part of a decade he had put in shifts anywhere across that back line, and can hold his head up high anywhere he plays.
Modric is insane. 37 years old!
Liverpool is really a midtable pub side that overachieved and their despicable fans deserve everything that's happening to their overrated pub team. Liverpool should make a statue of Vini at Anfield.
@6:21 min. "How to score a goal without even trying."
Real madrid is a machine. They completely sonned liverpool.
Got my shirt, tie, vest, ironed trousers and crisp jacket, plus my shiny shoes all on and ready for this gorgeous Liverpool downfall
Joe Gomez should have gone long time ago. I was surprised he signed a new contract. The midfield is the worst!!! LFC need to change the entire midfield. The kid in the midfield is not mature enough to play in the CL. He caused them the game. Henderson is all gone!!
HALA MADRID. Time to put the haters to sleep. AINT NOTHING NO ONE CAN SAY ANYMORE, WE ARE THE KINGS OF EUROPE CASE CLOSED.
Man as a Barcelona fan all I can say is WOW hats off for Real today. Not going to lie I was happy to see Liverpool up 2:0 but champions showed their heart today little luck but still champions for a reason.
If cristiano Ronaldo signed for Liverpool what would’ve been the result of this Mach
Best game in the round of 16 this year so far. Real Madrid always bring entertainment in every game.
Burn 2 goals in your home field is disappointing and it is coaching issue
Both teams slipping and sliding all over the pitch anyone notice that ?
If mbappe signed for Real Madrid what would’ve been the result of this Mach
If cristiano Ronaldo signed for Real Madrid what would’ve been the result of this Mach
What a performance! We actually destroyed Liverpool!
This game made me think I was watching Fifa 23
Nice try SHITPOOL. HALA MADRID. get these garbage EPL teams outta here
After being 2-0 down and then making 2-5 is just insane.
Real Madrid to Liverpool, is the same as to what Bayern is To Barca
CR7 did it first lmao
The Liverpool fans at Anfield must have been like 😐
Luka & Camavinga showed levels
Brilliant defense have never seen before.
Gomez better start learning Mandarin Chinese because that’s where he will be going soon😂
0:39 " in towards gakpo its darwin nunez "
Calm down, Madrid  It's just Liverpool
Vinicius stepped up and single handedly brought Real Madrid back.. Gakpo and Nuñes are pure hype.. smh . Salah was a good player for 1 year along with Van Dijk.. this liverpool is a joke. no future and old players suck
Balon D Or , Vini 🇧🇷
Man as a Barca fan I feel so jealous of how good Real Madrid are in UCL. I'll never support them given they're our biggest rival, but they're indeed the Kings of this competition. I do however LOVE players like Modric, Benzema because they've won so much already yet they put in more effort than frickin Joe Gomez.
Real king of Europe
where was the “the best cb in the world”??
The fact that militao has more goals than araujo in the champions league 😂
Liverpool thought they had it 🤣
This Is Real Madrid 🤍
Liverpool can’t and will never beat Real Madrid 😂😂
It does not matter what form R. Madrid is, as long as it UCL competition, they will alway perform well.
The fact that Vinicius jr has more goals than fatishit 😂
best commentator ever, has so much energy and most iconic voice ever, this guy shits on Peter Drury, who's boring a shit and is overrated because he says some more words than other commentators. Clive Tyldesley is the GOAT him and Ian Darke, plus Martin Tyler, top 3 commentators ever.
Liverpool did what I try on fifa, constant press since minute one and then gas out by the 60th lol
As a Liverpool fan, it felt like when one of the small la Liga clubs score against Real Madrid and they’re over the moon. But Real Madrid always knew they were going to win. Especially at half time
Until we destroyed all of Real's horcruxes, I am afraid no amount of goals could truly defeat them
Joe Gomez was so trash today
I hate to say it but too many mistakes from Alisson
Liverpool had a nice 15 min start...and then got CRUSHED lol
Don Carlo always cool as a cucumber
I see in this way, the  REAL MADRID repeats the same way from the last year's GO, REAL MADRI. 🥰😄
Liverpool choked a 2-0 lead 😂 they a finished club 🤣🫵🏽
Liverpool forgot it, R. Madrid, not Barca. As a Barca fan I happy to see one of liga bbva clubs winning rather than english club.
Two things I'm tired of waiting  1. Liverpool revenge against Madrid  2. Jesus return to earth
If Liverpool fans are protesting against the owners, then I am not surprised at all!! The deserve the right to be angry at the owners, Klopp, and the players!!
Real Madrid when they start a champions league game loosing..."You have activated my trap card  😈 "
I’m going to pretend that the match was only 14 minutes
Klopp’s future is uncertain!! He might leave or stay!! He is def not getting sacked tho!!
And they say they don't miss Mane. This was utter humiliation.
This gotta be some kind of sick joke...
The Núñez curse is broken
I don’t usually blame Goalkeppers for their mistakes as I chalk it up to mostly the club’s defense but Courtois and ESPECIALLY Allison were awful today.
The quality of the video is zero. I mean only 360p? 🤷🏿‍♂️
As a city fan Real Madrid owned English teams
Vini Jr. Is literally the owner of Liverpool .
Real Madrid is the luckiest team in the champions league
Real Madrid can lose 4:0 and still manage to come back
I wish the game ended at the 15th minute mark. YNWA
What was Liverpool thinking when they went up 2 nil 🤔
*Letting Mane go is one of the BIGGEST liverpool mistake*
How many times did Camavinga slip? Holy
Real Madrid in the Champions League is Inevitable
Liverpool need to reinforce their midfield and defense!! FSG really need to get investors in so they can be as deep as City!!
For Christ’s sake! Better than any world cup game!
It's strange Liverpool used to be our rival in the Premier League. Not anymore!! 😅😅👎👎
Only Liverpool would go up 2-0 and then lose 5-2
Poor palah  still haven’t settle his score😂
LIVERPOOL WHO?
Jurgen Klop has got to go..
Predicted a Vini masterclass and I’m glad I wasn’t disappointed
Anyone who thought Liverpool had a chance is so delusional.
Livarpool beat Everton and 10 men new castle think they’re back lol back to your shell you go 😅🤨
Liverpool suck
Klopp: book the hotel for Istanbul madrid: wake up to reality 🗿
Thought Salah was supposed to get “revenge” on Real Madrid LMAOOO
From 2-0 down to 2-5 away. Massive from Madrid, still waiting for that “salah revenge”
About 35-50% scripted.
When you've scored 2-0 against Real Madrid, you know you've lost.
Real madrid. Wow
El Real Madrid  no es el Barcelona es el papá  de todos
Imagine if you quit in the 2nd goal and return in the final minutes.
🔥Can we all agree Vini is the best 🔥
Nunez was offsides ? I'm confused how was that given
y’all gotta up the quality of streams i got 1gb upload speed internet and my shit still in 480p
Just goes to show how pathetic management is for spending big money on the likes of Darwin/Gapko. There's 2 players in Napoli right now completely destroying everyone they face.
As a Liverpool fan, this team is so mentally fragile. The tide turned at 2-1. Also, Gomez is garbage. We need two CBs and three midfielders to be competitive moving forward.
My idols pourtois and pallison can’t goalkeep 😂💀
There lucky it wasn't more
What a game 🙄
VINICIUS JR! ❤❤❤.
Liverpool just didn't get beat...They were annihilated.
How in the sam hell is Joe Gomez a starting center back on ANY professional team is beyond me!!
Lmao
Klopp is the only manager that will be losingg and still enjoy the wonderful football😊
Although we won, our defense is shaky and this is not a top team, yes I’m happy we won but I want to see more.
hala madrid comeback kings
better than the wc final
Give Nacho and Modric the renewal and a raise! Nacho deserves to be a starter.
Modric aging like fine 🍷.
Modric what a player
Frustrating as a LFC Fan, Fabinho and Gomez been our biggest weakness all season. Imagine if we'd have had Thiago and Konate, probably still have lost, but scoreline would be different.  So many issues man, medical team are a joke, every 3 week injury (konate been gone for a month, still no update, meant to be 3 weeks and back) - seems to happen to all our players, they are awful. Genuinely awful.  FSG promised us a midfielder when Gini left in 2019, we STILL haven't signed one permanently. Anyone defending that is retarded, we WON THE UCL and signed players worth 8.5 mil (sepp van der berg and Adrian) - FSG use the same thing every year, jan they do fuck all, promise a summer "injection of cash" never say how much, always undersell and then PR spin, typical American wankers.  GG Madrid obviously, there is a reason they are 14 time winners.
Amazing performance from Vinicius and the team. Sometimes people criticize him for some of the mistakes he makes but I’m proud of him. Scored twice and made an assist to benzene. Overall great game and on to the next one. HALA MADRID
Vini own liverpool
they thought they were back after beating everton 😭😭
Yall see the difference between Madrid's attacking players and Psg's attacking trio?? They still track back.....
Listen to the English commentators when Liverpool was up 2-0 vs 5-2 💀
Anceloti is that man that will offer you free things to obtain something tangible from you. Gave them goals first then beat them mercilessly 😭😭😭
Kidneypool
Lol get of Klopp man
An absolutely crazy game. If I had told you that Liverpool led this game by 2-0 in the first 15 minutes, you'd call me a liar.  I don't know what Ancelotti said to Real Madrid at halftime, but that was such an impressive second half performance from them. Their passing, their coolness when not in possession, and their finishing oozed of Champions League quality. It's even more impressive considering that they were 2-0 down and then went on to win the game 5-2.  Okay, seriously, how old is Luka Modric?
At least Salah got his revenge 😂
I don't have audio.
When anceloti got up madrid said ight no more playing let's actually take care of buisness
Liverpool mid to defense is so bad, end of and era sadly, Ggs to Real Madrid.
Where are the haters the clowns that were saying last year real won the matches by luck 🤡
Liverpool fan users on fifa are gonna be a pain in my ass even more 😩😩
As a Barcelona fan, I can't believe Jurgen Klopp was considered as a candidate to be a Barcelona coach before. Thank GOD we never hired him. 😅😅🙏🙏
Watching Senior players like Benzema and Modric lead this team is always a joy. Madrid has history and heritage. And they can keep it going with the likes of Vini, Valverde etc..
Poor Salah… the revenge will wait. Hala Madrid!!!
I’ll keep repeating myself! Liverpool has not been the same since we shredded their confidence in the final last year! We are the top dog in this competition and City, Chelsea, and PSG just got PTSD watching this game. Hala Madrid y nada mas! 😂❤
respect cbs sports always posting highlights fast asf
Madrid has showed many times and still showing liv even when they finally beat then it won't b much of a win unless it's a final to even get some kind of feeling back
Vinicius was brilliant today. Made the right decisions and proved how important he is to Real Madrid. Well done!  Edit: everyone in regards to Real Madrid played well. Im just eyeing on Vinicius because he had 2 goals and an assist. His performance overall was superb. However, everyone else like benzema, Rodrygo and modric and etc played amazing.
Liverpool shldnt have let Mane walk so easily. If you have a good thing going, keep the momentum.
They thought they were playing Newcastle again lol 😆
We killed them and eat them again n again  😈
GREATEST TEAN IN THE WORLD WE WANT MORE IN THE 2ND LEG
how the hell did liverpool not get 2 penalities? im so sick of VARdid so damn annoying 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Real Madrid showing why English teams are overrated
Two huge errors from two elite goalkeepers. What a match.
Fantastic comeback from 2-0 down and ending it with a 3 goals lead. Phenomenal performance from Benzema and especially Vinicius who has 5 goals in 4 games against Liverpool 👏🏽
If this was the prem, the highlights woulda been posted 5 to 2 hours later
What an amazing game. 2-0 to winning 5-2 at Anfield is wild. Real Madrid are a different team in the UCL.
As a real fan I started watching at 2-0 and was shocked and I’m still shocked after 5-2, what a game!
Bro Camavinga lost the ball 12 Times. He’s become a liability
Real Madrid are the true kings of Europe.
Sadly Madrid Dad is playing In Europa league and in PSG😖
HALA MADRID Y NADA MÁS
It’s been 4 years since and Salah still hasn’t come close to his “revenge”
Legend has it Salah still has a score to settle
Liverpoop
This liverpool are walking alone
From 2-0 down to 5-2 up, Real Madrid really are the comeback kings.
Madrid owns Liverpool 😭
Real Madrid has also scored more goals against Premier League teams in 2023 than Chelsea
HAHAHAHA!!! The Champions League final still haunts Liverpool!! Great job Liverpool for not sacking Jurgen Klopp!! You just made my day!! 🤣🤣👏👏
360p is crazy
Can't believe people actually thought Liverpool was gonna win lmao🤣
JUST WOW! Real Madrid showing their class once again. Shoutout to Modric and Benzema for leading the team to another comeback!
So embarrassing. Vini is good but no team makes him look as good as Liverpool does. Gomez is shit. Midfield is garbage and no attacking ideas after 20 min.
What a soul crushing defeat for Liverpool. Don't mess with Madrid in the CL.
Real Madrid in the Champions League are just sublime
Imagine being 2-0 up 15min in and then finishing the game 2-5 at home. In Anfield. Even after Curtois went FULL Karius😂  This is the Liverpool I know and love <3
Wow Real Madrid are something else in the champions league. Well played Real Madrid! Coming from a barca fan
we have a score to settle
Still waitin’ for Salah’s revenge against Real Madrid.
