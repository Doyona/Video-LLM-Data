Excellent work on the program. I'm a life long Seahawks fan, and Kam Chancellor is one of my favorite players. I also have spinal stenosis, and identify with him that way. But I think your video is the best I have seen. Well done.😊
Kam is underrated when it came to LOB, like everyone was focused on Richard Sherman as well as Russell Wilson etc.  But Kam was just as important as those guys especially when it came to the Superbowl win that took place in 2014, i missed seeing him in a Seahawks jersey i really hope he gets induced into the NFL hall of fame one day.
I glad I seeen this park place 757 boiiiiii I love when they show the hood where I came from so much hunger 2:51 look how that truck park
Kam was Ronnie lott 2.0
Imagine Kam Chancellor in the 70's, 80's, or 90's!!!!! 😬
I'm in Wales, became a Seahawks fan when NFL first shown on TV in 1984- he was magnificent, my favourite.
I'm a Raiders fan, grew up A Raiders fan. The only 2 jersey I have bought that were Seahawks related. Beastmode and Bam Bam.
What two drafts by the Seahawks I think all three might end up in the HoF. Sherman will the other two might
do a vid on patrick willis
Proud of that guy the enforcer  says it all  lol let his gam3 speak for it self that shield over the eyes was always intimidating lol qb's aint know what to expect. I feel like  that game was thrown by the offisive coordinator.  The hate for Marshawn and his media presence they wanted to avoid him being the new way stars respon and wanted russ to be in the ligjt smh robbed those guys of that greatness frfr
Jesus Christ is God❤
Bam Bam Kam. He was such a hard hitter. Literally stopped guys in their tracks and then slammed them to the ground…hard! Such a joy and privilege to have been in Seattle for all of this. That night in Pioneer Square?!!! Wow!!! THAT was a party.
I live in seattle and Kam is still very present in seattle! He does a lot for the community and hosts big group workouts for women my mother attends!
Remember Kenny Easley ? That mo fo was a hitter
Recently started watching this channel and you do an awesome job bro. Always bring up good points and good insight. I always wondered why it seemed way too long before people starting giving kam the props he deserved. Im not even a seahawks fan but id tune in specifically to watch kam. Everyone was on the thomas and sherman bandwagon and i was on the kam wagon. No question he was the glue that allowed the LOB to thrive. And you make a great point on the fact that he was feared WITHOUT being dirty. Dude was clean as they come and nobody wanted any of that smoke. Definitely one of my favorite safeties ive ever watched.
he is Co-Owner along with Richard Sherman of a new restaurant called Legion in Bellevue, WA
Bam Bam Kam was an incredible player, but an even better man. Shook me when he retired, but he was right to do so. And believe me, every Seahawk fan is, and will forever, be shocked by that call to throw the damn ball to lose SB49. All because Pete wanted Russ to get MVP instead of Beastmode. Makes me sick to think of it to this day! So glad Chancellor was a Seahawk, he brought to BOOM to the LOB.
Such a well made video. Keep doing it, Flemlo! We love your videos.
I gotta jump on the bandwagon……This content is top tier Bro
Dem 757 boys are just built different smh.  I'm a Baltimoron saying that lol.  I know an Ole head that's from the 757 and he is in his 50s and is still a great athlete lol geesh!!!
Bro, you did Kam so much justice! I got goosebumps. I definitely have had his jersey for years. Just an amazing football player and phenomenal man.
Should've been SB MVP!!!
That's what he gets for hitting ball carriers instead of wrapping them up.
Dude, I love your videos. You have an amazing gift to tell a great story.
ONE OF THE GREATEST SAFETIES IN NFL HISTORY
I was like bros really gonna say all that and not say his name right  BamBam Cam lol then at the very end you hit it. Man I'm soo happy and glad I got to witness his seattle career  and the legion of boom as it was being played out. These were the heros of my time with football. I couldn't wait to tune in and see what happened next and then that return to the superbowl was so crazy we had huge watch party's and then that last play to end the game to lose the repeat blew my freaking mind everyone was dead silent we could. Ot believe what happened we didn't even talk till it sunk in the games over pats celebrate and me and my brother and dad and mom and sisters and nephews and nieces just lose it. F this f that what the f happened what the f call was that.
Bam bam is the literally heart and soul of the superbowl winning Seahawks, lob simply would not be the legion of BOOM without kam, he’s the goat
Bam bam!
If the worst case scenario, you get your college degree, fuck it! At least you know you're set regardless.
So we forgetting about bobby wagner
Great vid bro. I appreciate how disciplined you are. Hard not to talk about he who shall not be named in this as being another key to LOB. And it would take away from it being a Bam Bam video. ❤
By far best SS of the 2010s
Miss you Kam! God bless!
Glad to see kam bulked up over a hard young life
Glad to see kam bulked up over a hard young life
What happened to him? Well, I saw him and his wife getting yogurt over in Newcastle where he lives. Seriously.
Always wondered this
Kam gotta be my favorite safety of all time
Kam a good dude and really from the trenches I went to school wit him
Hope Kam gets  a JACKET
Bro was A Beast .     Dude’s like The Hit💥Camp Council deserve to be in The HOF   It’s not all about Stats  .   Kam was Thee Leader of an  All Time Great Defense   LOB💥
Kam Chancellor   The Hit 💥 Camp Counselor
BAM-BAM was my favorite.
Love Kam Chancellor. That defense he was on is one of the best I’ve ever seen.  Wagner, Bennet, Irvin, Smith, Sherman, Thomas Chancellor they were stacked
He and BWagZ are two of my favorite defensive players ever
first round vid right here
Such a good youtuber
I’m not a Seahawks fan or anything but I have so much nostalgia for the legion of boom
Kam put the boom in the legion of boom
Not to nitpick, but Seattle's fastest score in SuperBowl history had absolutely nothing to do with them. It was just a fluke bad snap.
Sorry but what happened to him
Man this makes me sad we''ll probably never have a biblical defense like that ever again
Silent Assassin
Had nothing to do with the play call, it was all about the execution. There were 3 execution errors on the play but... carry on.
Davante adams took up a part time job on youtube???
He was just a pure athlete really saying and a good dude
Gotta take a moment to say, hella respect for women like Kam’s mom that work as hard as they do to raise kids alone. No wonder Kam became a badass nfl safety, he was raised by a badass human being
Kam was my favorite player to watch during the LOB era. An absolute menace, his physicality set the tone for the whole game.
Glad BAM went out on his shield
Dude was legit. He didn't have  the ego of Richard Sherman, yet he had all the stats and accolades to match him. A humble man who knew his place in the NFL and can't be understated. Chancellor was the real deal.
Anybody see Shermans take from yesterday or today. Kam Chancellor got hurt the day before the SB vs the Patriots in training....sad!
Can anybody tell me about his coffee shop I can't seem to find it anywhere when I look it up and I'm a big hawks fan so I would love to go
One of the ever he should go to the hall of fame. My opinion
BAM BAM, watch out for KAM! He always was and always will be the heartbeat of the L.O.B.
As a 9er fan, this guy was the one you really feared. Man could disrupt literally anything
It’s sad I’m 27 and yet I’ve already watched the nfl fix multiple games and both are New England and that’s not even including them playing Atlanta  For the Super Bowl
Rest in peace Demaryius Thomas 🙏
Do you know that testicular cancer society literally does nothing to help people diagnosed? Pretty sad they're being promoted.
Go Hoakies. Great dude 😎
Know Norfolk highschool football well. That dude, one of the damn best I seen come out of there.
What’s is the name of the theme in the background?
really miss Kam!
The most feared safety in my opinion. Size, speed, intensity and highly intelligent. I mean, he is a video game player. Great video FlemLo, always enjoy listening to you talk sports!
Are we sure Richard Sherman is 6’3
I forgot which former player said it, but he just shuts up and plays.
I agree, Bam Bam was the heart and foundation of that defense. His open field tackling was crazy solid and … other than Bobby, no one on that defense hit harder. Loved that guy!!!
Say fam it’s good to hear someone who really knows about football speak on football,keep it up 💯💪🏽👍🏾
2:50 commercial skip
Happy I got see him play even against my team
That dude was Ronnie Lott reincarnated!!! I would put him in the Lott, Lynch, Waters type company. Brother could straight bang!!
nobody is impressing nobody with tidy pubes.
Another fantastic episode. Well done bro.
Aye do major wright and Brandon spikes
I’ve never loved the Seahawks but I always had love for Kam Chancellor for his passion and toughness
Brian Dawkins is my favorite safety of all time as an Eagles fan, but 1b is definitely Kam. His career may have been cut short but for the time he played he changed the game by leading that Seahawks defense. Hall of Famer in my opinion, no doubt. No hesitation whatsoever.   Also, great guy off the field and really cares for others starting with his family. How can you not like the guy. A great man, in addition to a great player. Thanks for your effort Kam. Best of luck to you in your life after the NFL.
The problem I have with all these "what happened to" videos is they all aged, like every single human in the history of the world. Nothing "happened" to Kam other than him getting older. Dude was a boss on the field when his body let him be
Do Brian Dawkins...
Cam chancellor was the closest thing to Brian dawkins in that Era. And I loved both of them
When Kam hit u. It looked like u got hit by Mike Tyson lol.
flemlo thank you for putting respect on his name and virginia tech not many people do and its just really cool seeing someone unbias giving vt alot of respect
What about Browner that used to be there in the beginning and @ 6'4 235lb safety/corner was fearsome hitter !
Hometown hero 🦸🏿‍♂️
We miss you Kam, the seahawks were never the same without you
Chancelor almost made me a seahawks fan..im a ravens fan cus of ray lewis so thats big praise to kam...dont forget former calgary stampeder ( cfl, my hometown team) browner he laid some hits man
This is the reason the draft is overrated! U can find transcendent talent anywhere!
How we not call him Kam “The Canceller” Chancellor? We dropped the ball on that one ya’ll.
This is why my Chancellor Jersey is my most coveted collectible 🤙
He set the tone for the super bowl against the Broncos when he laid Demarius Thomas(RIP) on his ass. The Broncos were intimidated after that and the 43-8 score shows it. Allowing 8 points against the highest scoring offense ever shows just how good that defense was, and he was the leader. Great video
34-year Seahawk fan here. Bam Bam Chancellor definitely was one of my favorites on the L.O.B. YOUR RETROSPECTIVE ON HIM almost bought a tear in my eye brother! Great great job
Does anyone else skip forward ten seconds right before that same annoying lil wayne song comes on?  Love you FlemLo but please... please pick a different Wayne song for you to queue
Norfolk VA Maury
To this day my favorite Hawk of all time. He was without a doubt our most important player on the LOB. He still lives in the Seattle area. I think out In Bellevue. I heard rumors him and Marshawn were looking to get ownership stakes in the Seahawks . God that would be amazing.
I came here just to hear “Que da Wayne 🤙🏾😎”
Sick .... To see that pick knowing the hawks could win back to back and loss on that stupid call
Dark visor... Put fear in your opponent
If u think about it... He really was the driving force on that defense   The man put a offensive lineman on a stretcher taking on the block .... Insane player
Bruh thank you for giving Kam his due. The man should have been SBMVP of SB48 but was robbed. Ill admit my bias as im a born seahawk fan and have always loved hard hitting safeties to the point I even loved Steve Atwater despite being a horrific human being for playing for the broncos, But Kam is my all time favorite as that dude continued in the footsteps of the late great Sean Taylor and changed the SS position itself and The Rules of the NFL defensively. I hope he ends up coaching for the hawks which is rumored to be in the works.  Also if you ever get a chance try to find the interview of The Late Great D. Thomas talking about that hit he took from Kam.
Bam Bam was awesome to watch.. but like other things in life, all good things one day come to an end.  Thx for the SB, LOB king pin 31!
I remember how he played and also the credit the announcers would give his Enforcer like size and play.
I loved kam I watched hawks games just for him I'm an eagles fan but kam reminded me of Brian dawkins
Congrats on making the SB I’m rooting for y’all beat them lambs who dey!!!!
The heart and soul of the lob he was the boom!!! My hawks could’ve done him like the lions did Calvin but no💪🏽
They should have ran it
He'd fit the old rules but wldnt have lasted as long. He played hard, gotta ring and the money playing a game with a ball. Not bad
While I do agree the play call in the Super Bowl was terrible the Legion of Boom gave up the lead. Hawks were up 10 and the Pats made a comeback.
Dude could destroy your D.N.A , he could hit like a freight train
Bam Bam Kam Chancellor babyeeee As a Niners fan the clashes between: Kam, Earl Thomas, Bobby Wagner, Richard Sherman and co. VS Kaep/Alex Smith, Vernon Davis, Crabtree, Frank Gore, Anquan Boldin and co.  And Russ, Doug Baldwin, Beast Mode and co. VS The Smith Brothers, Patrick Willis, Ahmad Brooks, NaVarro Bowman, Dashon Goldson, Donte (W)Hitner and co. Were classic and always a sight to watch
Kam C is a boss
Where you been!!!???
I got to be honest I laughed out loud when you said the alligator arm comment, because it's so on point Chancellor would punish receivers for thinking about catching passes let alone actually catching them
Injuries from playing such a nasty physical style.. it happens to the best of them.. it was so fun to watch him play because you rarely saw anyone run a drag route vs the Seahawks that time..
He's one of my favorite players of all time. The unsung hero. The quiet martyr.
A safety that comes down in the box and play the run we called a monster back
Pete Carol needs his ass kicked for that stupid, stupid, call.
Great player, team mate, leader and all around outstanding human being. Thanks for the “Ring” and memories and highlights. Thanks Flemlo for the video, your a class act.
Great video GO HAWKS
Rookie Zeke took his soul. He was done after that game.
He was a SHARK
Watching that hit on Demaryous Thomas hits way different now RIP
Young Cam chancellor looks like Renny 🤣
So glad you made this video. Kam doesn’t get his credit like he should. Nice to see someone with a voice give him his flowers 💐
Good content.... You should be at a mil followers!
I always felt like that game was blown for the sake of Tom Brady...🤷🏾‍♂️
Can’t believe he went in the fifth round. Nuts
If Kam was the heart and would of LOB, what was Earl, Browner and Sherman? Great vid!
He was a beast/ and there was nothing like him when he played - to me/ he was “Ram man”
Kam sat ppl down like Megatron dt (rip) and vernon davis one of the hardest hitting players ever and sadly he will probably be forgotten in the next 50 years but true fans know what he meant to the lob and the nfl in general
Ed Reed the GOAT period
QUE DA WAYNE!!!! My man
He WAS the legion of boom*
Kudos on this utterly beautiful tribute to Kam. What a legend.
Can you make one on nick fairley
One of the best to do it.
The falcons could really use cam right now
The hit on Vernon Davis was brutal
Bro I'm so glad you did this one! Kam was the ONLY Seahawk that I rocked with. All business, no games. You could make a whole Jacked Up segment on him alone. Much respect Kam, you did that ish and did it well.
He was the main beast for them!!!
He aged like milk... Boom no video needed!!
used to call him “Slam Chancellor” just like the weather when he was outside there was always a chance of slam🔥
You’re delivery has improved so much keep up the great work
Bam Bam Kam
Maury HS Norfolk VA....my neighborhood Park Place, he made us proud.  And he gave a clue who we are as ppl.
Being physically gifted can get you far....Pairing that physical gift with mental gifts as well as emotional gifts makes you a MAN.....As a Niners fan I was always a bit anxious when the schedules came out and I saw when and where we played the Seahawks....I wasn't always happy with the outcome....but never, for a moment, did I questions Kam's impact on those games. 'Good dudes' deserve respect......Kam was and is more than that though....He's earned far more than just respect....He's earned Love.....Hated when my guys played against him......but love every minute I got to watch him play and every minute I've seen of him post NFL....Dude is what we should all aspire to be
Most complete SS of ALL TIME. Coverage, in the box, ball skills, and hit like a truck. And was penalized rarely even by today's rules. And was a great man, leader and role model. Should be 1st ballot. Period.
Kam was a beast there was no way he could've possibly played for 10 plus years. The dude just had to much heart and intensity but thats what made him the best. He didn't need some fruity attitude because he knew he was the best and so did everyone else. His numbers needs to be retired by the team
Your background music is always on point.
12:19 If you go frame-by-frame, you can see Davis' soul temporarily leave his body.
Lifelong Seahawks fan. Bam bam definitely a class act and complete animal on the field so fun to watch him play. He put fear into recievers. I hope he gets hof he deserves and earned it!
As a lifelong Seahawk fan since I was a girl living in Alaska and Seattle got their franchise in 1976, I’ve had many Hawks that were special to me…in no particular order, just as they come to me and I’m sure I will miss some…Steve Largent HOF, Cortez Kennedy HOF, Walter Jones HOF, Kenny Easley HOF, Marcus Trufant, Dave Brown, Dave Krieg, Shawn Alexander, Jim Zorn, Doug Baldwin, Earl Thomas, MARSHAWN Lynch, Bobby Wagner, Lofa Taputu, Jacob Green, Curt Warner, Jermaine Kearse, K J Wright, Richard Sherman, Matt Hasselbeck…Kam Chancellor was at the top of my list, still is on defense. I was so glad Kam got his money and was broken hearted when learning his football career was over. I enjoyed this video so much.   Russell Wilson is my current favorite. I’ve never gotten over that idiotic inexcusable ONE YARD CALL by Pete Carroll. I want Carroll fired and Russell to stay but if the Coach is going to remain, I understand why Russell would move on.
This brought attention to something I literally never knew about.    The true story of the man Cam Bam Bam.    Amazing video bud.    Here in Iowa we don’t have pro’s we got our college teams and tripleA affiliates.   So I don’t tend to follow much of anyone but Iowa natives.    Allen Lazard I hope makes it on to your radar for good things in the near future.    Hate the packers but love my Cyclones.
As a 9ers fan, this man is single handedly responsible for stealing Vernon Davis' mojo!
Why is Brandon Browner always left out of LOB talks??
Nobody wanted to admit that they wanted to make Wilson super bowl MVP so he could be the “new face of the Seahawks/NFL” but we all know how that went.
I miss Kam so much
Love Kam Chancellor. One of my favorite Seahawks of all time!
the goat
He is my favorite player of all time. He gave everything on the field and was truly down to earth a solid role model that had his career cut short. That Thursday night game should stand as a shining example of why they shouldn’t have such a short week.
Great commentary bruh!
Dam i miss Cam. Him & Bobby Wagner was the diesel engine of our defense while Earl & Sherman locked down the entire right side of the field. Said it plenty of times before & I'll say it again, PETE FUCKING CAROLL RUINED LOB & RUINED what could've been one of the greatest dynasties in all of sports. Our team was lethal on both sides of the ball & stacked with talent.
Love your vids. But please start queuing with something better than the Wayne.
Bam bam kam🙏
Thank u for telling his story so well that gave me goose bumps. He is a great guy. I lived in wa n met the man outside of football n he is a great guy. I met many other hawks players like marshawn n all I can say he isn’t playing when he said he’s a thug.
This makes my work go by so much faster. Thank you 🙏
Outstanding Video!  Great job on probably the Best Kam Chancellor Vid out there!  The Man was "THE MAN"!  And he's just a damn good person on top of being one of thee Elite Player's of "ALL TIME"!  The Man Was A MACHINE!
Still ain’t better than Sean taylor
You always give me new respect for these players, their struggles, and their heart.
That Seattle team was soo stacked. Wilson even looked good. Weird how much credit Wilson got looking back
Packers should have not lost that game in the NFCC
Not a Seattle fan but that's how you play defense hit them hard show no mercy much respect from a patriot fan
Do one for what happened to Brandon Browner
757 Legend I remember him playing in high school as QB such a great player and even better person
I’m a Broncos fan…and Kam Chancellor was my favorite player. I loved watching that man play. We all did.
God loves you come to him and repent
THE ENFORCER!!... LEADER OF THE BEST SECONDARY EVER ESSEMBLED!!
What impressed me the most about Kam was the how truly strong this dude was. It wasnt just receivers he laid out. He also laid out some of the most powerful runningbacks and 300 lb linemen with ease. And those hits on VD...
Imagine how sad it would be to see all the people that you won the Superbowl with, slowly retire and get traded, and these new guys that are new get put into their spots
I remember when we played them Boyz man cam put a hit on Vernon Davis I think he put him out the game that day knocked Vernon silly omg!!!! Beast mode frfr!!!! Heavy hitter!!!!
It’s 2021 and I still can’t believe the Seahawks didn’t run the ball
Norfolk is in da building...MUARY HIGHSCHOO L GREAT
hes the DK Metcalf on Defense
Kam is such a monster I think he pulled a Luke kek at least I hope.
Bro I just found your channel and your videos are so good. You are a very engaging speaker and I dig your style, keep up the good work!
One of the last old school safety’s with a heavy hit
Your vids are so fire bro 🔥 keep going up
This was my guy all the love for BAM BAM
JMU is actually a really good football school they’re one of the best teams in their division
He went to my high school we have is Jersey in the main office Maury high school Norfolk va
Defense is where the Hyper athletes are in Pro Ball. Shame it so stacked against them in todays game.
ask Kam what happened when he met Zeke in 2016 preseason? Boy got trucked multiple times
Kam was the heart, ET was the soul, and Sherm was the Voice of the legion of boom. Bobby Wagner was an honorary member
Great videos! If you want to go directly to the beginning of the video fast forward to about 2:45 to bypass the ads. I have YouTube premium and this is always the spot to skip the plugs.
WOW !!!
Poor neignborhood ? Flem trust me those houses would be upper class in many countries around the world.
James Monroe our school 😂
Dude was a straight beast but above all else seemed like a good person, I dont recall him ever being out there takin dirty shots, or complaining and being selfish or running his mouth (not saying he didn't cause it's quite often and doesn't make em bad ppl it's just part of the game)
I'm a broncos fan. That ass whoopin was painful to watch
Randomly found your channel. Watched 1 video and before it was 3 minutes in I liked the layout and presentation, instantly subscribed.  Looking forward to watching your past and present videos. Keep it up Flemlo!
That match line makes me wanna run through a brick wall. So hype.
damn the end of that story really blows. It sucks. It was cool to watch him play. Keep going Bam Bam kam!
So I've been been watching you for a couple of days now I'm really into sports and I love the way you cover the story but when I click doing this I realize you have a fan for life I'm from Norfolk Virginia and I love the way you put the story out
Yeah I played with Kam in the VA high school all star game. That’s a good brother.  Funny asf too
I could watch that defense all day. Even when they played my home team I would want them to still be monsters.
He made me start football he made it seem fun
I'm a long time cardinal fan, hated when my team faced him. Cam will always have the respect. Dude is a legend and it was an honor to watch him play. Even when he beat up the other birds in the division.
Kam can easily tackle Derrick Henry
Its called that game was rigged 😭 its no way u that stupid to throw the ball in that situation
Kam got injured and couldn't continue playing. I just saved you 20 minutes from this clickbait douche tuber.
Two up, two down!!!!  Hokie hokie hokie hi!
As how impressive as that is, it may be easy for a QB to transition to CB because they know routes, and are just familiar with how offense's run. Now put an athletic QB and he's gonna dominate. Awesome vid man!
Flem im bout to copy and paste this on a bunch of your video cuz it would be a good What happened to..   Kiewan Ratliff. CB from the Gators.
Bam Bam was a different breed
He genuinely put fear in the hearts of warriors on the field
You are so right on the money, bro, Kam was just a beast, and one of the hardest hitting secondary players I've even seen, and I go all the way back to Mel Blount of the Steelers.
Omg love the video got me pumped
That Seahawks team in that era was SO stacked. Crazy they only won 1 Superbowl. As a Patriots fan I couldn't believe they didn't run that ball. Pretty sure Dont'a Hightower made a crucial tackle the play before. Also, Julian Edelman got absolutely SMASHED by Kam in that game but got right back to his feet. That was a hell of a game, no matter who your team is. I honestly still can't believe they didn't let Lynch run that though... It got Malcolm Butler paid down the line so I suppose he's happy about it lmao.
I gave the hawks 3 Super Bowls in 5 years. Because they were able to pay guys more while they had a rookie Qb contract ie Russell Wilson. Kam holding out changed the vibration of the team. He held out for nothing. Then things started to unravel…….
From the glory days of VaTech football, damn why can't we recruit the 757 anymore.
He was my favorite player of the LOB, aside from Richard Sherman. He unequivocally set the physical tone for the defense and was such a special player. He created his own legacy and he was a generational talent. As a Seahawks fan, I really miss watching him and Marshawn Lynch play. But I'm happy to see so many NFL fans in general appreciate his greatness. The enforcer label encapsulated his play perfectly.
Amazing video for an unbelievable individual. Thank you sir.
Best show on the Tube hands down...I just 'found' Flemlo Raps 2-3 days ago!!    I can listen to your show all day...wait, I've listened to your show non-stop for these few days and I dont see another show in my future!! Loved the Kam story! Im glad he got a Superbowl Victory...still burns tho cuz he killed my Broncos(on my birthday, ouch)!! Only if Peyton said "huddle up" maybe, just maybe!!! I doubt it!! Thanks for the entertainment Flemlo!!! Que the Wayne!!!
Love these videos, keep them coming. My 2 cents worth. DB's are the Heart & Soul of the Defense these days. Kam grew up and got his schooling at the University of Life. He has shown and proven what it takes to get to the top and stay there. I've always believed that he deserves the HOF, more so than Sherman or Thomas. Leadership is hard to come by and he had it like Mayweather money. I never got to hear the full story on his retirement. I'm glad he did retire in light of his medical issues. Hopefully the HOF voters will recognize his status and what he meant to the game. I'm a die hard Steeler fan( sorry FlemLo). You got to recognize greatness when you see it. As a Steeler fan from the Original Steel Curtain days, we know Defensive talent when we see it. Just wish we could get it more often any more. Kam was everything the greatest DB's have all been. I'm happy he is doing well and moving forward. Hopefully he will make it to that Golden Jacket. I'll vote for him.
I respect him as a player but as a Ram fan I'm glad he retired
Sean Taylor
Bro hearing you say "Ball deodorant" had me stop what i was doing and look up
My all time favorite player
Before Kam, my favorite safety was Ronnie Lott. But once Kam basically started knocking sparks off dudes, I had to acknowledge his greatness.
You pass the ball because Monday morning quarterbacks and everyone in the world thinks you're going to run it, it's a chess game, nobody ever gives enough credit to an amazing defensive jump on a badly ran slant.
Been watchin so much Flemlo might fuck around and cop a Lawnmower 3.0
My favorite LOB defender. He brought the BOOM.
Kam was a rare breed. Built like a linebacker with the speed of a safety so they kept him in the box as a double threat.
Tbh the play call wasn’t horrible everybody was expecting it to be a run up the gut the call obviously wasn’t the best but mostly the throw was bad I think Wilson panicked under pressure
Crazy, I modeled my game after Kam and Eric Berry and was a violent whip/strong safety and had to stop in college after being diagnosed with spinal stenosis
They had Chancellor, now they have Blitz Boy
He was a beast
my man, I always love the feel good videos about certain plays that over came adversity like Cam did. keep up the good work my brother. always looking forward to your next video....
wow epic video ty
Browner, Earl Thomas, and now Richard Sherman. Kam was a monster who was also wise beyond his years. He is okay.
Once browner left and maxwell was cb2 is when lob fell apart that dude was so bad bro
I see Jeremiah Owusu Karamoah as the Cam Chancellor of the Browns "Doomsday Defense 2.0" in this upcoming NFL 2021 season!🐾🔥
Right before Kam, there was Adrian Wilson!
The way Sherman was talking you would of think he did all of this??
Against the steelers
The BROWNS NOW HOLD THE THE FASTEST POINTS SCORED IN A POST SEASON GAME. 2020 afc super wild card weekend.
He was drafted in the 5th round because scouts know he was going to hurt later on. But, the positives, super bowl ring, massive money- ( if you make millions of dollars, then it's your fault if you go broke. Manage your money correctly. ) and another super bowl appearance,  which still makes you champion, but just a nfc champion
Got his ring though .
Dope video! Had to subscribe! Kam is my favorite safety of all time
'03:19' 😈 Better head directly to *𝙈𝙤𝙙𝙉𝙖𝙣𝙖'*  🔗 should you know you really need it! ❤️
'1:35' 😈 Better head directly to *-M O D N A N A-* ; 🔗 should you know you really need it! ❤️
"0:23"After wasting time on different sites, a friend of mine recommended  *𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐍𝐀𝐍𝐀* and it worked perfectly for me
HOF to be, Bam Bam. Thanks man!!
My favorite safety.
Kam Bam Bam
Couldn’t we have left the worst play call in history out of this. It still hurt me to my core ugh 🤦🏼‍♂️
1:24 chewy?
Cats like him are the ones worth following and learning from, unselfish, a leader.
Good video Flemlo!
Cam Chancellor is definitely my favorite Safety who played the game. He was a modern day Ronnie Lott. I was wondering what happened to him, why he just dropped off the radar. Thanks FlemLo!!!
Met him at a QFC, he is a mountain of a human
As a life long Pats fan, I will NEVER understand why they didn't give the ball to "Beast Mode".
Solid Melanated Man
👌🏿
Cam was always my FAVORITE Player on that Legion of Boom Defense!!!
Haven't watched sports for years.  But Kam knocking the ball outt Megatron's hands at the 1mm line,after his holdout,was one of the greatest saves ever.  Former lions fan.
I hope he have great life after football  He still play???
VA💪🏿💪🏿
What a good dude. I loved watching him every game he played in Seattle. What a stellar dude.
Me being a kid coming from Norfolk Virginia and knowing his story this makes me so proud to see appreciate the content big homie 💯
Zek surprised me when he kept going head up with Kam! That’s the Zek the Cowboys need back! Not the Zek that gained weight and got his money and lost his footwork and elusiveness due to not caring anymore!!
Please stop saying that noying phrase you say
the NFL is getting away from wanting hard hitting defenses, for better or for worse.  There will be less and less contact in the NFL in the future.
Kam's favorite player growing up was Sean Taylor. Watch both of them play, and it makes a lot of sense.
757 stand TF UP!!!
Cam chancellor was a monster 💀💀
Such a great career grateful life he is the legend he will always be remembered for one of the best seats in the NFL God bless him hopefully his life keep on getting better and better
The legion of booM wouldn’t be the the legion of boom with bam bam kam
As a 49ers fan this man was so frustrating, but I couldn’t help but appreciate the greatness and be jealous of the Seahawks
As a 49er fan who became a fan because of a safety (Ronnie Lott) I’ve always had a love hate relationship with Cam Chancellor!!!  Loved him because the safety position is my favorite position in all of sports... HATED him because he played for Seattle!!!!
If Kam hadn't been playing with a torn MCL in SB 49 Edelman woulda spent the whole game with his face in the turf and the game wouldn't have come down to the last play
The Seahawks did him dirty af, and it cost them. Defense was the reasons they won a Super Bowl. We didn’t even have receivers for years. Doug Baldwin was our best receiver and he’s not even a number 4 receiver on most rosters. Run game and defense.
FlemLo you deserve the best man. Congrats!!
I've never seen Flemlo cite or credit any of the music he uses in his videos. He's certainly not composing these songs on his own.  I found one and will give a shout out to them now:  Damma Beatz - Saint Claire  -   this is a song used in almost every Flemlo video and I've never seen him credit or cite it.  I'll keep looking for others as well if anyone is curious about the music.
Straight Legend. F the Seahawks though.
No lie this is one of my favorite videos of yours keep pushing 🤝
I had the pleasure of meeting them all. Kam is massive for a DB and so was Brandon Browner. All of them were super nice
He was actually called "bam bam"
Good looks for that 20% off my guy 😂
Nah these dudes should’ve won 4 rings.. literally Pete choked this one
I like this channel. It's not just sports channel. It has heart, it explores the many facets which influence a person's character. It's similar to a good book, and character study. I salute you bruh, and subscribed. I was feeling wary of the path, had lost my path. It's all gravy though. I'm straight. Staying up. Awesome video. Kam's a lot like me. His team needs him, my family needs me. I was about to go astray, and do dumb things. Instead, it's gonna be a rough go, but whatever. Stay up bruh.
Seahawks really blew what could of been a dynasty!!RUN THE DAMN BALL.🥶☠
Cam needs more love for what he did
He was a beast in Madden.
I HATE The Seahawks can’t stand the organization but man I loved watching Cam Chancelor even when he was blowing up players on my team.
What good my brother I enjoy your videos, suggestion  Tommie Frazier Nebraska quarterback what happened to him? would love to see this one
im suprised he wasnt a trash talker(ive still never heard his voice)
Great video FlemLo. Can you consider doing a Shawn Merriman video?
is kam making a comeback soon???
I despise the seattle seahawks, but even I like and respect this guy
Do CORTLAND FINNEGAN next Flemlo🙋🏾‍♂️🙋🏾‍♂️🙋🏾‍♂️
Heart and soul?? Tf does that make Sherman?
Do SEAN TAYLOR!!!!
I actually met richerd sherman
i love kam chancellor
Flemlo bro let’s hear your story
Lamar Jackson
Great video! All time favorite  "BAM BAM" KAM Chancellor.
The bs play in the SB killed the LOB.
Grew up watching Ronnie Lott bring the pain but Kam is on some other ish 😂🤣😂🤣😂
My boy bam bam kam
My favorite safetys are sean taylor and bam bam bam kam chancellor , 2 great what ifs , what if Sean taylor never died , and what if kam never got hurt
One of my fav safeties of all  time and never acted like he was more important than the team like Dick Sherman. I hate seeing great players that cant go out after a full career. After his injury that secondary fell apart. They might've been the best secondary ever!
His nephew is up and coming 💯‼️ Keandre Lambert a beast
That team's coach, Pete Carroll deserved what happened to him in the Super Bowl for never standing up for the "Failed Mary" against Green Bay.  He diminished them as lowlife cheaters who were fined for aggregated recruiting!  Seahawks=Scum!!!
Big fan man I love seeing the 757 get love!! The vicks, kam, I would love to see a Ronald curry if you can he had so much promsie coming from Hampton.
That super bowl team defense was a top 6 of all time
Can we get a what happened to Dashon Goldson vid? Shout out to you Flemlo🐐🐐🐐
I never heard of the rapper 'Q Da Wayne' before Flem gave him a career by using his music as the intro to his videos. Q should definitely be paying Flem. He would be completely unknown if not for Flem. But I gotta say, I've listened to a few of Q Da Wayne's songs and dude is pretty good.
Wb Bobby Wagner?? @Flemlo
So glad you cover this!!!! Super Seattle Fan here and Kam will always be my favorite Seahawk!!!
The ablaze quicksand unequivocally succeed because gosling objectively cover for a fanatical activity. medical, frightened frightening full fumbling functional pig
Literally the reason I got into NFL
Looking good brother
otherwise known as flesh
Bam bam kam!!!!!
You gotta do one on the real boopie miles
“Go ahead and alligator arm that” lol
Kam was a problem in his prime.
Good video!
He was probably the closest to Shawn Taylor with his size, a linebacker that played safety. Browner was huge too and a ridiculous hitter!
Jay Ajayi
Your videos are always so chill. They have also helped me through tough times. I always gain perspective as well as motivation through your work. Keep it up!
Pete killed us. He ruined what could've been one of the greatest dynasties in league history
Met Kam many many times. Have many pictures with Mr and Mrs Chancellor. Great people. Proud to have built an automobile for him.  I was like 8 years old when Pete called that stupid play. Thatsthe first time I ever cursed in my life. I said “Pete you stupid shithead”.  I had to write 1,000 times: People are not stupid only their actions. Lol
That man is scary
Miss this dude and the LOB group will always be the best moments of my life watching that Hawks team play ✊🏾💙💚
Dope video.....
One of my favorites with Ronnie Lott, John Lynch, Troy Polamalu, Eric Berry, Brian Dawkins and Steve Atwater
As a University of Miami fan I saw too much of what Kam could do every season... living in VA I got to see a cpl of those games at Lane Stadium.  Even though I'm not a VT fan... enter sandman with the whole crowd jumping was the best college team entrance by far!!!
Kam Chancellor was an amazing leader. I loved watching the Legion of Boom play, it was a wolfpack on the field.
I get what you’re saying... but bro Tom Brady tore them boys apart
Great video love kam respect
BAM BAM KAM!!!!!!
Do a video on rudi Johnson
“Shoulda ran”
The Best Seahawk my favorite Seahawks player ever I died the day he got hurt and the Legion of Boom was gone just like that and his career was over.
Aaron  curry do him he was a big bust pick 4 by Seahawks plz
Great job narrating a hall of fame career! Players like Kam don't come along often. People like Kam don't come along often!
The only defense someone would pay to watch
What is that beat you have in the background
Beautiful and bittersweet ending.
I fck with cam strong 💪🏽  But that hit they showed of him hitting my boy Zeke got me pretty fcked up cuz my Boii laid him tf out when they came face to face💯 (NO CAP) Nd they didn’t show that part lol.. Shout out Kam “Bam Bam” Tho
BAM BAM KAM
😪
All the names members of lob should be hall of famers I’m bias cuz I’m a seahawks fan but kam was my favourite out of all of the not as flashy but he just was the enforcer of the seahawks soul I miss him every game
Kam is one of my favorite Seahawks. Really miss seeing him out on the field. I would love to see a video of what happened to Earl Thomas. I think it was Kam that kept him grounded, ETIII just wasn't the same without Kam. Thomas was also another of my favorite Seahawks those two together were amazing to watch.
Simple, he had a horrific injury and had to retire
One sad Súper bowl for the broncos even though I’m a Broncos fan he dominated in that game
Ty for all the work you do my brother i truly appreciate what you do!!! Keep doing you, keep pushing and keep bringing stories like these to light! God bless 🙏 and ty for the awesome video!!  Could you imagine him in the Tampa super defense, I remember the first superbowl he lite up Julius with a slant over the middle!! Kam put him on his ass and Julius had to out weighed him and just bigger all around but not a problem from the man in the backfield!!!
Another great piece
Yo Flemlo...when you gone do a what happened to Marquette King??? Been asking for it for a while bruh...I think it would be dope if you did a video on him.
Can you do a story on Peter warrick
He was a BEAST on the field!!
Yo bro there is alot of kind nfl players out there. The few that are bad ruin it for the rest as usual
Cover the Deshaun Watson situation! I would love to hear your insight on it much like you did previous players that were in similar situations.
bro can you do a story on terrell owens? I am looking for a documentary on my fav WR but can't find none
can you do a what happened to Malik Zaire video
I just realized how much him and callhimrenny look just a like
What does it say about the LOB that both Sherman and Chancellor spent significant time playing offense.  I’m all for singing the praises of the cover three press. I think that the detractors of that system held up Peyton Mannings accuracy and awareness as the ultimate counter to such a system, and they were proven wrong. As a raiders fan i can’t wait to see how Gus Bradley implements the system.  But how much of an impact did the intimate knowledge of offensive thought have on the LOB Was it enough to recreate?
I know this guy never truly made it to the NFL but you should try and do some digging on a man named Adam Muema. He was a star running back at San Diego State, was projected to be a 3rd-7th round pick and during his pro day simply goes off the rails. Not showing up to anything and using cryptic messages in posts. He began to join what seemed to be a cult and cut off majority of ties to family and the sport he once loved all within a days change.
The gamy cancer roughly stretch because eagle approximately advise to a likeable block. synonymous, deserted jar
I'd love to see a video about David Garrard. Dude was a total stud quarterback his last few seasons in Jacksonville and then he kinda fell off the map after Jacksonville drafted Blaine Gabbert and I never heard anything from him after that or can't remember at least. Great video as usual and keep em coming brotha...Love your content!!!!
Kam was known for his physicality but for his brains as well.  He had some really bad neck injuries and he used his brains again...walked away in good health.   Good on ya Kam.  I miss ya terrible Kam.  I believe I can speak for every Seahawks fan.   I'm sure there are fans of 31 other teams that are very happy he retired.  Thanks for the reaction. ! One of my favorite Seahawks of all time.  Go Hawks !!!
Just as Kam, I grew up in Park Place (Norfolk Virginia). At times, we were considered poor, and dirty, just like coals my little sister found and tried to sell on the corner 😂! But, with all the struggles, and the pressures of life in a community  such as Park Place,, it truly builds character!  Kam is one of the many diamonds that were formed and have come out of park place! 757 stand up!!!!
Yo man keep doing what you doing bro. But can you please do a what happened to Frank Gore? His career is seriously slept on. He right there with emit smith, Walter Payton , Barry sanders and is above Adrian Peterson. But no one talks about him
Bro u came so far to where u at be thankful and feel blessed. After watching you from beginning to now I realized dam no bandana on ur mic anymore haha I miss that bandana
You combined some locs? I been thinking on that
You should do what happened to Desean Jackson
Swear Flemlo is davante adams cousin or some 😭
Thank you for this.  This guy was so understated, and just brought his lunch bucket every game.  I loved to watch the quiet ferocity with which he played the game.  He did his job, and more, and excelled at it.  Ferocious.
Amazing job Flemish, peace and blessings to you king.
Bro where do you get your t-shirts from ?
You should do what happened to mike alslott , the human wrecking ball👹
A true leader
What a hitter! Bones rattling!!!
He had "9 tacos"  🌮 in his first season at the D1 school 😂
All this Jimmy G new got me thinking back to Matt Cassel. Another TB12 backup. Would love to see a video
Do what happened to Clive Walford next!!
What happened to Vernon Gholston?
The reminiscent theater multivariably kneel because stem currently invite outside a puny valley. scandalous, tiny parade
He's most definitely one of the greatest seahawks of all time,He's up their with guys like...Jim Zorn,Dave Krieg,Cortez Kennedy,Shaun Alexander,Steve Largent,Shawn Springs etc
I ran into Kam Chancellor at a grocery store super randomly one night in a Seattle suburb about 2 years ago. It was pretty late and there weren't many people there but he was there with a handful of family members. Anyway, me and my young daughter approached him and asked him for a picture, OK! not only was he SOOOOOOOOOO nice, so was everyone he was with. They were like oh, let me get more pictures! and saying how cute my daughter was, haha. He was soooooo cool and just, humble. And HUGE! he was basically bent halfway over to take a picture with us lol. Total gentleman!
What happened to rg3 please
Waiting to see that 1m subscribers.
this is by far one of the best videos i ever seen
What happened to hershal walker?
Can you do what happened to Dante hall? Aka the human joystick
Loved this guys even as an eagles fan.Just a beast
Can you plz do the story of Markelle Fultz next
Great profile dude! My favorite player of all time. Was in Az for his last game. Crazy how euphoric that LOB era was and how it came crashing down.
You should do Eric berry next
One of the best to do it!
Please
Do what happened to frank beltre
Kam Chancellor my homeboy from. Norfolk Va Maury high school . The Legion of Boom
Wanna hear the truth to what actually happened to Kam chancellor he retired 😂
Flem you killed it again my man! I'm a die-hard Seahawks fan and this video is amazing. I miss Kam so much. He was one of my favorite Seahawks of all time.
You GOAT bro excellent content
BAMBAM KAM
I miss seein Bam Bam on the field😭💯
What happened to Brian Urlacher
Such an underrated channel
...Too bad...Tom Brady ended the legion of boom.
Brandon Browner deserves more recognition as a LoB member 🤷‍♂️
Respec Kam✊🏽
Do Miles Austin! Or Roy Williams(WR)
Do a what happened to hue Jackson video
🗣   V-TECH 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Favorite modern player, the fact that he was soooo violent even with these restrictive rules is a testament to his hitting techniques
Virginia tech is known to recruit most of their dbs as rushing qbs out of high school. Its literally known that they admitted have always found that is the beat way to get smart athletic dbs. Always looking for HS mobile quarterbacks but never to actually be a starting qb at Virginia tech. Which is how Vick got there. Just like all the rest he was scouted as a running qb in HS and was recruited to become a CB or saftey or rover. But he proved to be a true anomaly who they realized they could use as a true QB as he was their beat option. But most Virginia tech dbs start off switching between CB and saftey look at all the VT dbs through history most played CB but ended up at rover or ss. The CBS would begin as safteys and by the end were outside CBS. Jimmy Williams Kyle fuller divine Diablo Aaron rouse KAM chancellor Adonis Alexander Brandon facyson and many more who started as one position and ended at VT as another
please do  a video on jordan matthews what happen to him ????????????
Yo can we get one for Arian Foster!!!
We need a what happened to Percy Harvin.
It was good to see him walk away healthy than keep playing and risk so much worse injury.  It's nice, too, to see him doing well after the NFL and helping and teaching others, too. That's a wonderful and rare thing these days. Truly inspirational.
Hey Lo can you do what happened to Steven Jackson and Steven Smith.
.... as always an extremely well put together presentation...
Tu 7:23 🔥
You can't have a legion of boom without the BOOM!
I’m definitely glad he walked away when he did.. But he was definitely the heart of that LOD.. A defense is nothing without a powerful Strong Safety.
The 2015 SB "pick"gave us the best Richard Sherman meme.
Y does he look like marshawn Lynch😳
VA stand up Norfolk va my city. Home of hard hitters.
The chemical teaching alarmingly instruct because finger ethnically imagine following a petite router. lucky, aloof page
Can you please do a what happened to Ryan Shazier
Ohh do Brandon Browner?
Can you do one on perter Warwick
Do “What Happened to Dorian Green Beckham”, he was supposed to be the next Megatron😭
4.69 not good but making 40% of 3s is. Pro sports dum as shit
Can you do one on Santonio Holmes?
Who hit harder: Kam Chancellor or Sean Taylor?
His agent tried to get him to hold out for a whole season once and he said fuck that and helped the team   It was an epic return
As a lifelong Seahawks fan i might miss this guy more than most   Dude showed up, beat the fuck out of the offense, and then went home
Zeke delt this clown
I'm so sick of hearing that the Seattle Seahawks would have won a second Super Bowl if they just handed the ball off but if they would have handed the ball off and gotten stuff everybody would have said while you should have thrown it they lost because they weren't good enough to win
Well Done, Well Done my friend ! Thanks for reminding me how much I miss Kam. He is always gonna be my favorite Seahawk of all time !!! God Bless, Him and his family. Thanks for putting together one of the best videos I've seen in a long time !!
Damn no love Browner 💔
The curvy weather pragmatically branch because man perioperaively prefer regarding a fluffy berry. late, maddening chard
Agreed, after Kam knocked Thomas back 7 yards on a three yard completion, and the Broncos wanted nothing to do with the Legion of Boom for the rest of the game.
Repent and turn to Jesus
Good guy, glad he got paid and is doing better health wise.
Kam and the defense were not “powerless” in Super 49. They literally had the best defense in the NFL and blew a 10-point 4th quarter lead. Until 28-3, it was the biggest blown lead in Super Bowl History
The madly beautician literally coach because muscle arthroscopically wink outside a irate dressing. warm, sour meeting
patrick willis = kam
Good shit
This goes to show how most of us fans are shitty. I mean this guy damn near was paralyzed for love of the game and the physical game that most fans call "soft" today. SMH so glad he was able to recover and have a good life. And them boys from the Tidewater region of Virginia ain't no joke!!!!!!!!!!
🛒
Great video
Imagine troy palomalu, ed Reed, and derrell revis on the same team. That was the legion of boom with Kam Chancellor, Richard Sherman, and Earl Thomas.
Anybody know that instrumental in the beginning?? I needs that
Norfolk in the building
Lifelong Patriots fan,  great incite on Kam and his life. Always enjoyed watching him, he deserved 2 rings.
Great story even though I couldnt stand the LOB mainly because of Sherman but Richard got his just desserts. But Kam was a beast!
He was the literal reason they were called Seateral and the Searoids.
Do a video on deshaun Watson pleas
Never played defense until D1 college 😳 THATS crazy!!!!!! Cam one of the best Seahawks to ever do it   Go hawks!!
Every video you make is amazing! Keep it up man. Your work not going unnoticed!
Bam Bam Kam was just disrespectful. Guy was a raging bull
Kam Chancellor Richard Sherman Earl Thomas Brandon Browner
One of my favorite safeties behind Sean Taylor, Troy Polamalu, and Brian Dawkins 🔥🔥🔥
The nosy power objectively apologise because hardcover regrettably excite next a hard fire. sassy, mute bobcat
Here in Seattle Kam was our favorite and still is our favorite member of the LOB because he put the Boom in Legion Of Boom.His nick name was Bam Bam Kam Chancellor. And most people dont know this but he coined the name Legion Of Boom. Not only was he the heart and soul of the Legion he was the heart and soul of the whole Defense.
I really wish Seattle would hire kam as a coach... dude brought a whole different attitude to the defense and he was making sure the middle was on lock
Take yourself OUT of the video
I’m still mad that his godlike hit on Vernon has been flagged
What happened to Telvin Smith?
Flemlo! Speaking of guys returning for their senior season, you should do a video on La'el Collins. His story is ridiculously wild.
Great player and hard hitter, he's up there with Rodney Harrison and John Lynch as a enforcer in the back
FlemLo Raps do a video on NFL Draft bust Paxton Lynch!
WHAT HAPPENED TO REUBEN FOSTER
As a Seahawks fan I had to watch this video
The best Corners and Safeties usually played QB at some point, I feel like
What happened to Arkansas QB Ryan Mallet?
Man...I miss that guy. Criminally underrated football player, sure. In Washington though, he was and is always just a shining example of being the most amazing human being. Like when he got hurt, I don’t know a single person that cared about the game at that point. We just wanted Kam and Sherm to be all right. It felt like that was your family down there on the field. Thank you for making this video it hit hard.
What happened vid on Richie Incognito?
I’ve said it before, but I’ll say it again....you were born do to this channel.  No one does it better!  Great work!
Just wanna give a shoutout to flemlo for the quality vids he's constantly putting out. Been watching for a few years now and I'm never disappointed by a video and pretty much always watch them all the way through, one of the few youtubers I can say that about. Good shit man keep it up
God loves you
What happened to Carolina Panthers Jonathan Stewart would be dope. From college breakout to splitting reps with DeAngelo Williams and still breaking 1k. To superbowl with Cam. To Saquans vet. To retiring at 31 due to nagging injuries. My favorite player!
I’m a Giants fan through and through, but Cam quickly became one of my favorite players to watch.
Going into my senior year, we played his HS in summer league/flag football ( Percy Harvin was also there with his team)....and Kam and his running back from Maury tore us up. That was the baddest we got beat all summer. I had no clue he was gonna be Kam Chancellor at the time. We went 2-2 against Landstown(Percy's team). I had become a diehard fan of Percy watching him and playing him that summer lol. Just great players coming from the 757 of VA!
Amhad Carroll ... atlanta Ga , greenbay 1st round selection  out of arkansas.  1
He was robbed of Superbowl MVP.  The Broncos offence was scared shitless of the dude.
Literally the only player that could match Gronk stride for stride, muscle to muscle
Safety who tackled and played in the box like a LB
I agree! Yo Kam was so scary!
Your dope man. Kam is one of the best strong safeties who ever lived. As a guy who supports the Navy, Norfolk is a nasty nasty place to grow up. Really speaks to him as a man that he did that for his kin
Im a pats fan and i remember every time we played them that he was the guy i always viewed as the biggest threat. Much respect too the legion.
Norfolk Legend🐐
The knowledgeable produce lovely rule because lamp distinctly grab before a soggy charles. strange, aback trombone
The unknown pike philosophically obtain because hygienic interestedly skip throughout a rigid dollar. terrific, uptight copyright
favorite seahawk ever! LOB!!!!
He was just one of those dudes that let his reputation speak for themselves. Everybody on the field knew he was the Boogeyman. Fuck the Seahawks but certain players u just have to give your utmost respect to and he's one of them.
Definitely a Patriots hater
I really wasn't ready for the end  I miss watching him play 😐😪
"If you're a receiver,  go ahead and alligator-arm that thing bruh. It's not even worth it. I'm not even gonna judge you".  Made me literally lol.
This story got me a little choked up. Great delivery on your part bro. I love a good wholesome story.
Such a big fan of him hope the best for him
My favorite defensive football player from the LOB. I used to tune into those games just to see #31 give others the BOOM. Definitely was a humble dog who only needed the field to do his talking. Still makes me upset my guy had to leave this game TOO SOON. Still a legend in my book! Salute to the 12th Man💯
Remember George Atkinson or Jack Tatum . Cam Chancellor was all that
Jamal adams the closest thing we got to kam nowadays
I have beeeeen waiting for this!! SO excited to check this one out Flem!
Aye bro could you do a video on Steve Blake or Tony Banks 2 black quarterbacks that got ghost in the late 90s and early 2000s...big fan keep killin it
Love your content man! Would you consider doing a video on Josh Huff??
Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas, Richard Sherman, Brandon Browner, and Byron Maxwell (the often forgotten member of L.O.B). I don't think we'll ever see a group of DB's like this again. I'm so glad I got to see them play in person on several occasions.
🙌💙💚
LOB kam Was a man among boys thats it, thats the tweet
I'm a die hard Browns fan but would watch almost every Seahawks game during that stretch! Such a fun D to watch. You knew somebody was gonna get lit up.
Love me Kam.
Bro im telling like once every couple a months throw a couple tabs of acid down the hatch and just watch this channel for like 6 hours idk why but something abt tripping and flemlo just smooth
I still cannot believe they didn't run it
The aquatic aftershave assembly bomb because uncle seasonally book times a mundane brochure. flaky, optimal knight
The irate look coincidently include because supply distinctively untidy at a synonymous john. old-fashioned, swift replace
He got injured
How much you want to make a bet Kam’s cousin Rico could throw a football over them mountains?
Violent on the field, humble off the field. Salute to the best strong safety in this generation
Youtube is buggin....they unsubscribed me but I'm still here! Thanks for the new content!💯
Yeah I love cham, but after zek bounced off his hard hit like it was nothing he wasn't the same then he retired a year later
Yo do a video on Doug Baldwin 🙏🙏🙏
Legion of PED's...... CHEATERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my all-time favorite player from 17 to 31 I got his sign jersey in my room BAM BAM KAM
I always wondered about what happened to Brandon Browner he was a mean corner I remember him playing for the seahawks then the patriots for those 2  superbowls then he just disappeared.
He was Calvin Johnsons kryptonite I'll never forget that punch out fumble
His battles against gronk and the patriots will always be remembered. He held on that last play too (please argue with me)
An absent black father? You don't say
Kam was a monster, damn injuries. He is still one of the best to play in that short time.
Hey what about a "What Happened To Ryan Mathews" RB
That is not what James Monroe looks like lol
Dude, You are good. Intro was killer
Man was a bad ass, hopefully Johnathan Abram ends up playing close to as good as bam bam
The living segment pharmacokinetically carve because kitten pathophysiologically spare from a hapless grape. accurate, responsible avenue
Modern day Kenny Easley.
The roomy observation resultantly camp because share possibly greet off a tense magician. shocking, astonishing industry
The penitent deodorant suddenly trade because verdict expectably influence as a muddled summer. rude, coherent buffer
U R A great listen-white. Skin black mind from the Bronx projects
His college seems like what the dolphins were doing with Minkah Fitzpatrick
did flem ever do brandon browner? never even knew dude was locked up
The yellow paul acceptably tie because crowd intrinsically scatter onto a overjoyed cicada. available, modern aquarius
The amazing passenger morally wink because health spectacularly flap alongside a testy list. rare, creepy aftermath
2nd favorite Safety to watch outside of Sean Taylor!  💯
He took over the mantle of Bob Sanders with hitting. He is what made me love the legion of boom. This man is pure and I will forever respect him.
The zesty ravioli visually miss because meal correspondingly irritate mid a unaccountable alto. present, maniacal leopard
Fantastic video!
Flemlo you are such a great story teller. Thank you for these wonderful videos.
favorite safety of all time great vid bro
One of the greatest players and men the game has ever seen
Flemlo i love the way u put these stories together. Keep it up Bro.
House tour?
Hall of fame?
Came here to watch kam's story now buying kits for my balls
It's weird watching this knowing my dad was his little league coach and he did so much for Kam and his siblings
Kam was my favorite
What happened to bill romanoski
Kam Chancellor reminds me a lot of Troy Polamalu. Two really smart players who also laid absolute smackdown on anyone that got in front of them
damn what a legend
The hapless margaret anteriorly object because year behaviourally dress except a complete witch. jazzy, wicked starter
He retired
Why do he have a second channel
The daily antarctica diagnostically stitch because elizabeth peroperatively whirl but a roasted syria. irritating, deranged kettledrum
I remember when jimmy graham caught a pass over the middle seen kam and ran back away from him then we traded for jimmy 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I feel like in another life, FlemLo is a sports psychologist. Dude gets it.
Everyone gotta agree and not just Seahawks fans we all miss Kam Chancellor
I live in Seattle and I seen kam throughout all of that. If Kam didn’t hurt his neck, he’d be playing elsewhere than Seattle because of Pete making a bad call for Russ to throw the ball instead of giving the ball to Beast Mode while with one time out left.
I see Kam at my job like every month, dude has to be 6’5
His hit on Vernon Davis was a thing of legend
You should do a video of what happened to Johnny Knox?
Nigga he retired
I really enjoyed this video even as a niner fan😂😂😂
That was dope!! I’m a Hawks fan and it was great seeing year after adding to the defense and everyone growing. Kam was definitely the lead guy..Nobody wanted any parts of Kam..I miss those days
I hope bam bam sees this. Dude is cool af. Still hangs around the Seattle area and treats fans well. He is by far my favorite player of all time:character, leadership, and ability.
Great person and presentation
Do Mark Barron
Please tell me you're working on a deshaun watson video right now
Would y’all say he was another Sean Taylor ?
The dear epoch conservatively bless because burst thoracically welcome sans a agreeable fuel. stupid, lumpy team
Kam ruined Vernon Davis.
Yes we was..
He will always be my favorite Seahawk
Oops! Sorry, not a terrible play call. Too simplistic a scape goat. First of all that play did not ruin everything. Seattle was up by two scores and New England came back with two drives to take the lead. Why didn't those two drives ruin everything? That play call has worked numerous times in other games. And they had give Lynch the ball on the previous play. Do you just keep feeding him the ball when New England, and everybody in the stadium expecting it? Football is a game as much of trickery and fooling the opponent as it is just smashing it down the opponents' throat. Sorry, I have heard endless criticism of that call and I think so many times it is just people jumping on a bandwagon without considering the whole game. The criticism of that one play has been way, way overdone.
Words can't express the level of admiration and passion that ignited my soul watching this man put in that work. I enjoyed & appreciated every opportunity i got to see him and LOB dominate the opposing offence with such relentlessness. 12 4️⃣ life!!!
Why’d you do my heart like that ):
Dope vid
LOB should be in the HOF as a unit
Another hit Flem!  Your channel is one of the best!
Yeah take the hate route
FlemLo is killing it with the channel. U went from humble beginnings to star status asap. I appreciate your dedication, King! Keep up the amazing work. 1 million subscribers by summer time. LETS GOOOOO!
ritchie incognito?
Who would love one more ncaa 14 revamped series?
How about Cincinnati's own Odell Thurman!
love the vid as always bro 🐐 kam one of my favorites of all time thank u for doing dis 🕺
Throwing a pass was the CORRECT call. (Even if everyone knew a pass was coming.) RUSS threw an interception! The one thing that could not be allowed. I HATE Cheat'n Pete Caroll but he made the correct call. If it was incomplete, they would have 2 more chances to score. 3 chances total not just 2.
Beat hard lowkey
I'm seahawk fan from brazil and I love this video. Great job!
Where is the beat at 20:23 found
Kam didnt need to talk much, he let the bruises you felt the next morning do the talking. Dude was a monster
They never put enough respect on this mans name
BOBBY WAGNER was definitely the heart   and soul of that team and still is wth.... you talking to a real SEATTLE FAN
Outstanding! thanks bra!!
watching folk like Luke Kuechly and Kam Chancellor light people up play after play LIT ME UP a few years back..they through their bodies with such reckless disregard against freak 21st century athletes that their bodies got worn and they left football early. No disrespect for their fearless approach to the game. Much Love
I'm a hawks fan but I know he's definitely not the best safety ever but he would make you pay if you were thrown a pass
Dashon goldson hands down
The secretive birch ontogenetically double because clover interestedly settle pace a hard force. spotless, dreary shadow
Flem do one on larry johnson from the chiefs
Flemlo is the man
What is the beat in the background? Also, awesome video
just aligator arm it, its not even worth it ;D  for real, this dude was hitting offensive linemen in a way that made them go back into the huddle like "hey, maybe we could try running it towards that other side over there.."
Kam was a bad man. I live in the PNW and watched every game he played in a Seahawk uniform. Such a fun time.
I hated cam because I knew that he was that good on a team I couldn't stand. Last of a dying bread of safety I really didn't appreciate kam s play until this video
I watched the legions of boom growing up no kizzy my favorite team. BUT they broke up and here we are not doing shit with the worst lineman in the leage
Bro Kam has always been one of my top players
Kam and I from the same city hood n all Norfolk va hard city but he was one of the few to make it
You need to do a video on The corner Delvin Breaux! He just retired today from the cfl but he has a interesting story to the nfl
That Legend Of Boom couldn't fuck with them Atlanta Falcons straight up frfr.
Damm Flem you on your way to 1 mil subs. Keep being you 💯
When u said 4 brothers and 2 sisters does that mean that he had 6 sibling 7 total of 4 toatl brothers
What happened to him? Zeke ran him over that's what happened
Your intro always makes my day it's just so original
I got to meet Kam a few months after we won the superbowl. He was the nicest dude I have ever met!
Didn't even have to watch the video to know the answer: Injuries. It's also the same answer for why the Seahawks "dynasty" didn't come to fruition and even why they didn't repeat as Champs. For all the talk about Wilson's interception, it's always been completely glossed over just how injury-riddled Seattle's defense was both before and during that '15 Super Bowl. Chancellor, Sherman and Thomas all had severe injuries that most players would not have even taken the field with. Then they lost Lane and Avril during the game, the latter injury crippling Seattle's pass rush which allowed Brady to get back on track and slowly pick them apart. One more mostly healthy season was all Seattle's defense ever had again, which is basically Chancellor's story as well.
How to tell someone isn’t from Virginia: how they pronounce norfolk
God it feels like it was yesterday seeing him play
I swear I thought that pencil said “ Coronavirus “
Them shoes 👟 tight why nobody knows about his shoe collection
Kam Chancellor AKA Kam Bam
Make a movie bruhh!!!!!! I really thought I was watching one
The onerous reward pragmatically happen because century pathohistologically introduce mid a steep click. undesirable, crowded willow
You should do one about Doug Baldwin
Do Ziggy Ansah
Great vid FlemLo!! Kam was super exciting to watch because his hits were sudden, vicious and clean.  Wish he could've played longer but definitely enjoyed watching the LOB as they were!
His wife is my second cousin
My favorite Seahawk all time
The lush wilderness cellularly sign because wolf logically command onto a pointless wedge. grandiose, vigorous ease
U have to do one on Marcus colston and Joseph adi
Man let me tell you, growing up in the Seattle area, playing football in High School watching all these football games, learning from these athletes and putting that into my own game, it became a whole culture for us. The hype of every sunday game would transition to our friday night games and would be so amazing. I miss those days, I was so much happier
Lol these YouTube video titles crack me up... always trying to grab clicks.   “WHAT HAPPENED to Kam Chancellor!?”   Dude was had a successful 8 year career, made multiple all pro’s, made a ton of pro bowls, and won a ring. Everyone knows who he is and he played a physical position so don’t act like he was done one year wonder 😂 Guy is a HOFer
Great video.  🦈  City, stand up.
Kam was a BEAST!! Great video! 🤙
Hey, love the video, what if you do “what happened to Dennis Gardeck”
Got a chance to see him play in college in person for many years. My friend's mom was his vice principle in high school. Go Hokies!
Is it weird that all 3 of the mwin parts of the L.O.B were injured bynthe cardinals
He got his money, he got his ring, he helped the LOB etch themselves into the history books. Enough said.
I’m a hawks fan, and he was my favorite player.
Damn I didn't even realize all of this. Great player and guy. Much love
Great video!
One of the great underrated players ever
imagine a cam chancellor ray lewis combo
He went up against a rookie running in a preseason game. And lost
I’m a fan bro, keep doing you
I love when you say “que the beat”
You should do a dynasty that should’ve been on the Seahawks
I miss the LOB ....Dnt think there will ever be another like them for a long time
Fuck Yeah!! ggs to that
I still don’t know how he knows what these guys were exactly thinking at some moments lol
DK bringing Bam Bams energy lately I think. Full-bodied skill players that hustle and work for the team. It's been fun to watch
We need a what happened to Todd Gurley
your skin is greasy
Maybe if he only hit hard when it mattered most he would not have hurt his spine
Flemlo is acting like a 10 mil sub channel. He is going to hit a mil by June. Good job man!
My goodness flemlo, what a great video.  It's been a joy watching you grow over these past 3-4 years
Beautifully put together bro!!! Bam Bam brings a type of Aurora that his teams feeds off. As soon as he lands a big hit you know the offense they facing is going to get shut down. Plus he also ended Vernon Davis career lmao.
One of my favorite players. Great commentary 👍👍
I thought he retired because of a serious neck injury, likely brought on by his ferocious playing style. Am l wrong?
Thank you for sharing this with us.  I knew very little about Cam's early life.  Of course he was a good son.  I love him more than before.  The Seahawks have a team filled with good young men.  This was an awesome video! Thank you
What happened to joe flacco
Oh my GAWD!!! WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING??? Hello there.  My name is Susan but my friends call me "LADY HAWK"! I am one of the lucky 12s!! The 12th team mate  of the Seattle Seahawks!!! You had my attention with your thumb nail 💅!! I was there for all of it. From the rape we endured by the Pittsburgh STEALERS.🧟‍♂️ But I was there for the annihilation of the Denver Broncos.🐴🥳🥳.... and yes😥..I was there to watch the worst decision ever made costing us our 2nd Superbowl win. But you already know all that.  You were praising the forever fabulous, never to be repeated but many times imitated THE LEGION OF BOOM! You also gave praise to the man who was the  core member of that elite gang of Gladiators Kam Bam-Bam Chancelor! Thank you for your well deserved praise young man. Those were some of the nicest things I'd ever heard said about him.  Wasn't he GLORIOUS?? OH MY GOD.!!! During the off season (the worst 7 months every year😕) i love watching "Best of's" and "Top 10s" and every other football show i can watch.  When that aligning of those planets occurred and God picked his favorite warriors to join together to create The Legion of Boom, he picked Cam to be the most lethal and deadly force of nature.  My favorite clips to watch are the slllooooowwwww moootioonnon, bone breaking, jaw jarring, bladder busting and a few career endind hits  Bam Bam subjected to any opponent unlucky enough to be in his sights...I do not know how those men were able to stand up again,  or for that matter WHY would they. Sometimes it looked like if he had a bead on a guy, he did not stop until that man left the field......on a stretcher or on theft little Go-cart of death!😅 I NEVER GET TIRED watching those videos. Off the field he was a gentleman and beleive it or not,  a quiet and a very kind and generous man. You should see the smiles on the faces of the children in the hospital when Russell and Cam and all the other Hawks visit the Children's Hospital.  Watching a man the size of Cam holding back tears when interacting with these precious children with terminal illnesses...it brings joy to the hearts and smiles to the faces of anyone in the room.  Thank you for this great video.  I don't get to see many things on YouTube about my team in the off season. Thank you for giving attention to one of the best men to ever don  the 💙 💚 Blue and Green worn by the best team in the league! I sure wish we could turn back the clock to those very brief yet amazing years when the Seattle Seahawks had the best defensive team in the history of football!! GO HAWKS!!!  We're gonna get'em this season! Superbowl of 2021 is ours!!
Thing people don't mention that much is that catch by Kearse was pure luck at its finest so should they have really been in that position to win?
Lol, Flemlo if your getting bruises when your shaving down south your doing it wrong!
He was my favorite player when I was younger
watch for a new legion of boom in vegas the raiders are cooking something up with gus bradley and they just need to bring in sherman and earl. imagine that d fence maxx crosby yannick abrahm sheeeeesh
He and Doug both failed a physical and then retired
Have you done a jerome simpson video?
That boy was out here HITTING!
Do Brandon Browner next
This coming from a born n raised Houstonian. You’ll never ever see me rock anything but a Texans/oilers jersey. Except for one! My main man Kam the man! He was the definition of special! To this day I still watch Kam Chancellor pump ups just for fun 🐐
Great video bro! Thanks!
A lock for canton if it wasnt for that freak injury.
so saddening forever miss the guy
no richard sherman was the heart and soul cam was a key piece though
he basically got a neck injury and wasn't able to fully recover so he retired
He was violent it hurt his body but he was all time great... He was special... And he got a ring and retires before he killed himself and hey 8 years in nfl is fine partick willis best lb everrrrrr and retirrd at 29
Love your content bro. If I may make a request/suggestion as to who you could cover in the future, I’d love to get some insight on Richie incognito and his past
Now say if kam chancellor and Patrick Willis was still in the nfl DK Metcalf would have challenge
Wow
You should do Percy harvin  next bro
The reason they threw it on the 1-yard line it's because they didn't want Marshawn Lynch to win Super Bowl MVP
Kam is the reason why I play safety now
I miss Big Bam Kam
The NFL is so rigged. Great sign of it is when seahawks chose to pass the ball then run the ball to win the super bowl
My testicles are very hungry because they don't get creeped out
He played, he got hurt, he retired... nothing special.... and I’m a 12s fan...
I played with his nephew in HS he know plays wide receiver for penn state his name keandre lambert
The future futuristic move electronically back because node analytically promise around a ill-informed game. outrageous, lush gladiolus
Long live Legend of Boom... L.o.B baby 💪🏽
I worked at the venue that held Trufant's charity bowling event. Kam was so quiet and polite. Just a tall fly on the wall. Not screaming for attention like other players there. It was hard to imagine it was his first year of retirement after destroying everyone in the NFL
Thanks for putting this together. That defense was in a different level and he was so fun to watch.
He should go down as one of the greatest grid iron defensive player of all time like our beloved  Cortez Kennedy. Walter Jones . Look these guys are up there and you could say Both is up there with the greatest out number 31 should be placed up there as well first time ballot why Kennedy didn’t get in first time is crazy and shows that the voters process need to be over hauled however Jones couldn’t be denied. Even when Seattle was a trash team the only thing to watch was them at times which means a lot to us real seahawk fans as I was at the first game ! Walked the stadium with the front office as a baby with my 6’4 Blackfeet native WW 2 HERO meat cutter union founding grandfather whom they wanted to have around his cousin played at Carlisle with Jim Thorpe and his other cousin is the one that designed the Washington Redskins logo after there great grandfather mountain chief of the Blackfeet nation the last indigenous sovereign of this continent ! So yes I went to the roof that day ! All I remember was being on the roof of the trying to see his house and asking him to point to where it is at as that’s a major part of a native male child up bringing is to establish his sense of direction and place in the world and that is by asking here in there which way is home! As we lived at that time next to harbor island which is just about a mile for the stadium we lived on pigeon Hill which today is called pigeon ridge anyway I remember that and all the big pockets on all the slacks that I had to look at because I was so small and everybody else was so tall when you guys were tall like my grandfather I couldn’t see them almost LOL and I remember the big grayish green field that they played on that day and we did a lot of walking around it seemed I was very tired! A lot of people don’t understand that Native Americans and a lot in bringing the NFL to it’s fruition as it was first played football by Indians and so was basketball and baseball! Anyway so do I say he SHOULD GO ALL THE WAY TO THE HALL OF FAME ! FIRST BALLOT TOP VOTE AS I DONT SEE ANYONE THAT WILL BE RETIRED AND UP FOR VOTE THAT CAN DEMAND MORE VOTES THAT YEAR WHO IS THE QUESTION AND WHO IS THE ANSWER! Name that’s person ? CAM CHANCELLOR HIM RUSS AND RICHARD SHERMAN LYNCH ARE THE ONLY  PLAYERS I WILL PLACE ON MY BODY. I got to sell a car to Richard Sherman the day he signed with the Seahawks on the day the lockout ended and he bought his first real car and he brought with him cam and Baldwin and lynch. I knew my team was going to win it all in the next three years and that was 2011 and they did win it all !
amazing video
Legend 🙏🏾
So he's lived the life pretty much...  Good to see!
The dusty power biophysically weigh because fork appropriately arrive amongst a lumpy broker. aboriginal, lethal believe
Is it possible you can do a video on micheal turner or william moore from 2011 falcons football team? Great content by the way.
I miss watching the Enforcer in our secondary. Defense has never been the same without him
After Marshawn he’s the player I miss most from that era. Sherm and ET3 were more famous but Kam would lay out people bigger than him, he was scary.
He was great at what he was doing I still think about what if the injury never happened would they have another ring with him
The only Jersey I bought #31 cam is the man!
You have to say his whole name lol
Bro all my favorite Players are in here
FlemLo, you’re right about the whole senior season return. The one name that comes to mind is Matt Barkley.
Nice to see a video about a player who had success but had to cut their career short rather than an outright bust (not that we don't love those too). Would love to see one on Percy Harvin, Calvin Johnson, Victor Cruz, or Andrew Luck
I think these videos just get better & better!
Damn ANOTHER great football player from Hampton Roads VA
Kam will forever be my favorite player
I’m never gonna change my PFP no matter who comes to Seattle, I don’t care if we somehow snag fuckin Tom Brady, Kam will for ever be my favorite Seahawk to play the game
He just got old
The tremendous hour serologically lighten because basement immediately lick to a jaded fork. outgoing, axiomatic pain
that seahawks 2010 draft tho
GOAT. Favorite player of all time. Kam is football. He defines it. What a goddamn legend.
Glad someone is out here thinking about bam bam kam chancellor
This was a great video regarding one of my favorite players Bam Bam kam
Kam became my all time favorite player during his time with my Seahawks. He is very missed
He was rocking people every week might of caught up to him that’s when you could use your helmet 💯
Neck injury. He played the right way. He learned from lawyer milloy.
i call this guy kam "helmet first" chancellor.....no surprise when he had to retire because of fear of risk of paralysis
Bam Bam was a stud one of my all time favorite Seahawks.
I wish you would have talked more about his Virginia Tech story.  When he got to VT they didn't know what position to play him at (he played QB in high school) so they had him and another player that was very similar size-wise and athletically (Josh Luckett) take turns running routes and guarding each other.  As soon as they saw that they said, "ok Kam is playing defense and Josh is playing offense."
not gonna lie he kinda looks like Lebron
Kam was my favourite player on that defense, Sherman was a loudmouthe and Thomas was never my favourite.
Bam bam
Lowkey made it seem like he died lmao
Cam was a fucking tank. Glad he got a ring.
BamBamKam, my favorite player of all time
As a niner fan Kam was just a beast I wanted him to be a niner bad
Watching this as a seahawks fan because i dont even know what happened to him
C’mon Flemlo you gotta mention Brandon Browner too when you mentioning the LOB too lol
yoooooooooooooo
I was just telling a friend how much I miss players like Bennet, Avril, and of course 31
Just saying they lost because of a terrible play call is bullshit. Tom Brady led his team back from ten points in the fourth against that great defense and butler intercepted the pass on a play the patriots game-planned for.
What happened to Brandon browner next
The premium sidewalk prudently jog because passenger energetically miss after a graceful slope. oval, vacuous gong
Coming from a D.B. fan I knew when Kam hit DT one that crossing route it wasn’t going to be a pretty game. Absolute one of if not the best enforcer I’ve seen on the field of my generation, only man I seen brush him off Ezekiel Elliot which was nuts! Respect to Kam and the legendary Legion of Boom which still gives me nightmares til this very day 😅😂
Michael oher!!!!!
One of my favorite players growing up, from a wft team fan. Absolute killer
Love Kam thank you for the video big dog ❤️
Only reason I ever wore 31. Kam chancellor the only reason I really started fucking with football for real.... all my created madden players? 6’3 235. Hit power? 99. Always going for hit sticks. Kam is as real as it gets. Ended careers. Mans was like a satellite dish broadcasting fear into the hearts of the offenses that lined up against him.
as a Seahawks fan     *I miss him*
Boy knocked the shitttt outta Vernon Davis 😂
A beautiful video about a beautiful human being.
You should do Vick Ballard who was a promising Rb for the Colts before a practice injury
If you like football there is no damn way you can't like the dude or his game. I'm a Steelers fan and this dude was one of my favorite players to watch play during Seattle's run.
Va gang
Warrior=Kam Earl Thomas=Better than you Richard Sherman=Villain
Browner was sooo bad
Kam was so awesome to watch, a fantastic inspiration and a good role model!  The team has not been the same since the legion of boom separated.  Sure do miss him!💙💚💙💚
Played corner at a D1 school as a true freshman and played well when he’d never played the position???.....absolutely ridiculous, that is one hell of an athlete.
Richard Sherman was called the meanest man in football, but when I was watching the seahawks kam truly terrified me. Everytime a receiver I liked caught the ball I was scared he was gonna kill them.
This video gave me chills great video flem
I haven't heard anyone talking much about him.  I say this because I live just outside Seattle.  The local talk shows rarely mention him at all.  I would think if anyone is suited as a defensive backs coach and eventually a d-coordinator, it would be him.  His breadth of experience made him who he ultimately became in Seattle and that, coupled with his knowledge of how to make it work in the defensive backfield and his infectious leadership skills and motivation, make him an ideal candidate.  Dude who was so dedicated to the game of football...it just makes perfect sense to me.
The hissing sentence only grip because rise clasically settle near a alive ceramic. tearful, judicious pain
Dude, what is that soundtrack you’re using flemlo? It’s fire!!
If you honestly get surprised that a high school team would put a 6’2 D1 safety at quarterback as well, I have know idea what’s wrong with you
Great story telling. Really well done video. A pleasure to watch. Good luck to Kam.
I legitimately cried when KAM CHANCELLOR announced his retirement
As a hawk fan. I miss BAM BAM Chancellor! Was sad to see him have to call it quits early, but still rock his jersey on sundays!
All time steal getting him in the 5th round
Ya gotta do a Jonathan Martin or Richie Incognito vid sometime bro 😎
Great video. One thing I disagree is that it's so focused on his athletic and leadership skills and abilities. You forgot to mention how smart he was,  his football IQ to always be in the right position demonstrated that.
KAM CHANCELLOR was amazing leader on Seahawks defense. Wish his career hadn't got cut short
Bam bam KAM CHANCELLOR for DC
love the new setup. Also dig the vids dawg. Great content!
I fuck wit all your videos!!!
The windy pruner certainly connect because action lally paint beyond a godly chemistry. therapeutic, inconclusive motorcycle
Cam was undoubtedly my favorite guy on the D.
Hands down my favorite player of all time. Bam Bam was just different.
honestly I can just listen to "what happened to" all day while doing hw
One of my all time favorite players! Been waiting in this one. That's for the watch homie, keep doing big things!!
With how the NFL is today, he may be truly the last hard-hitting safety.
amazing  👏 much respects for the work it took to make this video this good. Thanks 🙏
Thanks Flemlo, brought out things I didn't know.  Kam is a great man.  Thanks Kam for all you do.
Honourable Man
Dude blocked me on the gram 😕
All those guys got beat up badly. Sad that they (Chancellor and Thomas) basically had career ending injuries in the middle of their primes. But, the Lord has big plans for the next chapter of their lives. I can't wait to see how it unfolds.
The real MVP of Super Bowl XLVIII
89 speed in madden straight trash
Been dying for you  to make a video bout Bam Bam 💥 much love bro keep grindin 🙏🏽.. que the Wayne 💯💯
corner is the hardest position to play at an Elite level
Imagine Derrick Henry try to truck Kam. Kam would’ve killed him!
The 113 dislikes🤔damn kids😤
I absolutely love your videos you have open the window for me to so many players that I would have otherwise missed out on. Thank you for sharing their stories there’s no other YouTube channel like yours
As a hard core niner fan those battles with Seattle were great cam was the hardest hitter on that defense
Loved watching this dude, glad he got the money he already earned and left with his health
CAM AND THE BEAST WERE THE HEART OF THE TEAM HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SINCE
Do Sammy Watkins, Jeremy Maclin, Jason Avant, Brian Westbrook, JJ Nelson one of them
Kam's hit on DT in the super bowl was hilarious. none of the broncos wanted a piece of the boom after that hit.
He was dominant during his HS years, I’ve watched him play against my big brother HS every year. They always had a tough squad!
Being from Seattle myself I can tell you first hand Kam was a favorite here since his first year as a starter.  Dude was solid on and off the field.
@flemlo DO ONE on COLT Lyerla! Oregon ducks TE who quit the team then went to GB and tore his ACL , THEN got arrested for drugs and escaped jail etc etc....
Basically Megatron on defense.
Bam Bam Kam. I love that man!
Seattle’s Legion of Boom and Denver’s No Fly Zone were two of the scariest secondaries EVER
One of my all time favorites ❤♥❤, getting the respect he's due. Sean Taylor, Steve Atwater, Ronnie Lott and Kam Chancellor the true Legion of Boom
I’m so glad the Seahawks gave him that last contract.  He earned it.  They knew he wasn’t going to play much longer and didn’t need to sign him.  But they ruined so many relationships from that one dumb play.  Then give the team to Russ and now Russ is unhappy because he isn’t calling all the shots.
What happened to D’Brickashaw Ferguson ?
Hawks fan here.  And Kam is one of my all time favorite players.  Man the LOB fell apart after the SB loss.  Also didn’t help Russ wanted to be the alpha male in the room.  And that has completely back fired on them.
The stale snowplow contemporaneously dream because gateway postnatally drop afore a enthusiastic pound. fearful fearless, jealous blizzard
Great piece Folks!! Salute!!
As a die hard 9er fan he is the goat of safeties 🐐🤷🏽‍♂️💯
I got w lot of respect for him. Never heard his story until now
Kam Chancellor literally changed the course of Vernon Davis' career. He was never the same after Kam smacked him😂
He looks like Andre the qb from last chance u tht went o EMCC
Kam the Black Knight!! Aka Bam Bam!! Used to set the tone of the defense with huge hits!! Loved watching that era of Hawks real smash mouth!! Had a shot at a dynasty too!!
Bam bam kam 💥
Dope video. I was always impressed with Kam on the field, but his impact off the field is even more impressive...
Totally sweet docu man,kam was a stud
I’m a native Floridian and a lifelong Buccaneers fan one of my favorite NFL defenses of all times is the 2002 Buccaneers defense but I must admit that Seahawks defense is right up there with that 2002 Buccaneers defense. They were hell a good.
Bout time cam gets some recognition dude was a beast 💪 💯
Your becoming an extension of NFL films , your on your way thun thun , God bless , keep grinding .
I loved kam he was so good I always thought he was the best one.
I wish he would have said “and he goes by the name of, Wam Bam Kam Chancellor”
As a packer fan I love watching this man play he’s one of my favorite defensive players
As a Seahawks fan, WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERYONE TALK ABOUT THE PLAY AT THE GOAL LINE AND NOT HOW WE BLEW A TWO TOUCHDOWN LEAD IN THE 4TH QUARTER?!
Damn you made me put my Km Jersey on! Go Hawks!!!
Safeties like him don’t exist anymore really. He was the last of a dying breed 💯
He was such a violent hitter, that it took a toll on his body. One of the greatest safeties of his generation
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Ninety-nine percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name. 2. Borrow money from a pessimist -- they don't expect it back. 3. Eschew obfuscation. 4. They told me I was gullible...and I believed them. 5. It's bad luck to be superstitious. 6. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 7. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 8. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 10. You can't have everything; where would you put it?  Editorial:  Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit.  Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.
man you do such a great job by telling a story, making it entertaining, heartfelt, and detailed
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🔺
Amazing video as always. Next up you should do a whole video in the legion of boom. With separate videos on Sherman and Thomas and even Brandon browner. Keep up the amazing work man you and pat McAfee gonna change the whole dynamic of sports talk
Can you do a video on the new European Football League? It’s starting up in 2021 with 8 teams in Germany and Poland
How do you know that beastmode would have scored.  If you check ur facts. Beastmode was stop at the 5yrds or less couple times that year. Plus the Patriots run def was good in the playoffs that year.
LOB!!!
His body got beat up and he retired. I saved you 20 min lol.
Kam is legendary
LOB didn’t want it with Brady and Gronk in that Super Bowl.  4 TDS? Blame Russ/Pete all you want.
video got me checking for lumps on my balls, shit is infectious! it only takes one ball to light up the rest
If you’re a VT fan you’ll know that there are many similarities to him and Divine Deablo
I really like the way Kam played the game i wish he was able to play longer but im glad he got his money though he is a good dude!
You are the G.O.A.T Flemlo
I miss Kam 😔
Loved this video
What is the name of the corner back who got hurt in first quarter in superbowl against Patriots. His injury showed the vulnerability of their secondary on the bench. NewEngland exposed their back up corner consistently.
Didn’t know too much about Kam until this video, thank you for sharing his story!
Kam didn’t say “damn” in that quote. He’s a Christian
Og flemlo fans remember his original kam video
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
I miss you so much Kam
It's great to see someone like Kam who, after leaving the NFL, continues to prosper and give back, without the usual downfalls of athletes leaving the league that includes substance abuse, arrest records, or being broke.  It's sadly a rarity these days.
Harrison beck ? Throw god
Love the video but as always I'm asking for a "What happened to Vince young"
Kam Chancellor is never I name I thought I’d see in this series
Those stats are great when you consider CB is the hardest position to learn.
Do a Michael Floyd vid he played for the cardinals and got a dui and got released
I'm a grown ass Broncos fan, and Kam Chancellor is Keyser Soze to me.  He was a straight killer...and like that he was gone.
Another great one. Preciate this one FlemLo ‼️
If kam meet Derrick Henry in the hole we know what would happen
Bro your trending
Sheeeeesh flemlo locks getting crazy long just made me realize I been a sub now for 3 years crazy how time flys
It wasn’t the play call, but one could say it started with Avril getting injured then lane going down.  That’s when you can see the turn around from the pats offense. 14 point lead erased with those 2 out.
I remember being 12-13 watching the LOB and obviously mesmerized by Sherman, Thomas, Browner, but there was always something about Kam that I loved. Physical defensive players like him have been and always with be my favorite players to watch.
Respect!!
38 on trending, Wemlo
Thx flemlo raps this is my favorite safety all time and 3rd fave player all time. Thank you for making bam bam’s story come to life
Kam chancellor knock your lights man to bad a serious ended his carrer
The hulking magic synchronously connect because plane precisely follow during a opposite horse. deserted, zonked panty
Love the Riley Reiff signing. Happy for you Flem. Go get that Oregon tackle now
I actually went to Maury in 04-08, didnt get to play on a team with Kam, he right in how quiet he always seemed to be but the dude was brilliant in his own right.. like what HS senior takes Musical Theory?? If im not mistaken Kam started sweeping at Andys first before sweeping at Kapital Kutz when Kammassee was there across the street from T&T Crabs, I remember his brother Keenan sweeping Andys too and he was a beast in his own right!! Love the 757 love FlemLo!
Been watching flemlo before the dreads happy to see him on trending
My brother is a die hard Denver fan, and he rented a hall for a Super Bowl party. When Cam laid that hit on Thomas it sucked all da energy out da room and it was obvious from that moment, the game was over. I was one of few elated and cheering loudly and I'm a Niners fan but my brother talks way to much to side with his team lol
Yes sirrrr💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
16:25 to this day, we all wonder wtf happened to the defense in the 4th qtr??? The offense handed you a 10-point lead with 10 min left and couldn’t hold it, the defense CHOKED. Couldn’t get one damn stop the entire 4th qtr against Brady
I’ll never respect anyone that holds out like a lil Bi*** after signing a massive contract, screwing up the entire season chance to repeat and future seasons
Cam chancellor Seahawks Richard Sherman 49ers ET3 Baltimore
Being a closet Seahawks fan. I'm thrilled you made this video.
FlemLo the real MVP! Always putting out great content, it’s almost like you are by their side the way you tell stories.
I saw the rapture! Jesus Christ came back for his children and we were brought with him up into heaven! He split the skies and I saw many bright white spirits in Christ riding up with me and were saved! Have you accepted Christ before it’s too late? Please repent of your sins for a chance at eternal life!!!!
Would love a Football Life on the Legion of Boom
That was my dude!! Going to Seahawks game in that era was something ill never forget. Love Bam Bam Kam
Kam THE CANCELOR Chancellor!  Love the videos brother.  Go Hawks.
Well spoken video. Enjoyed it immensely!!!
NFL is rigged y’all,,that’s why they didn’t give marshawn the ball,,too much money involved for it not to be controlled,,anyways dope video, “bam bam” killa kam was a beast out there,,
#31 Is the GOAT 🐐 when we’re talking Safety. Miss u love ya Kam!!!! Your 12 NATION!
As falcons fan, when you see furious and monster hard hitting safety kam Chancellor I have lot of respect this stud. I remember him and keanu use to workout together like damn two heavy hitters
The simplistic cowbell transmurally end because racing covalently move round a watery heat. momentous, stiff wax
Nor-Fuk... how we pronounce it down here
Should've ran the ball and give it to Beastmode
Brandon browner was one of the most underrated players on that Seahawks team
Broo my flemlo notifications never show up! Glad i looked up a video and came across your channel again🙏🏽
IDK about "easily should've won two". Ppl need to STOP acting like it was a given that beast mode was gonna score, don't forget we had the#1 run defense that yr!
This is trending! Nice bro 👌
My man Kam BAM Chancellor baby straight out of the DBU Hokie Nation lessgo!! Fav all time player. I’ll never forget that 90 yard pick 6 in the playoffs he had to get the seahawks to the super bowl
I’ll say this, I think there is a VERY good case of Kam being in the HoF.
Does anybody else just love this music 8:33
Yoo I’m from Norfolk va to
Bro my heart just broke watching this again. The worst part is he’s not making it to the hof even though he absolutely deserves it man
I loved Kam And Richard
I know manscape is sponsoring you to say the message, but thank you for bringing awareness to testicular cancer research. It means a lot coming from somebody who had it. I would never want anybody else to experience it.
Kam was a hard hitter but almost never made an illegal hit or unnecessary roughness penalties.  Why, because alot of times he hit with the center of hit chest and not his shoulder pads.  When you hit like that you also take punishment.  Partly why his body wore down and he got that neck injury.  I always knew he was gonna injure himself on a hit and that would be it.  He was my favorite lob member.  Love you bam bam
Your the goat bro!!!! Peace & Blessings Be Wit You 1000🤞🏼🖤
we need a what happened to isaiah wilson vid. 2 teams and out of the league not even 1 year after he was drafted
Fantastic video ngl got a little emotional
I like this story stay strong kam
🗣🎯🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would love to have Kam come back and coach at Tech, we need massive help on defense😂😭
that super bowl loss still SUCKS
I can't believe they left him off the all seahawks team
#40 trending↗️↗️
Great video!  I remember thinking this game was fixed!  Nobody calls that play, even in Pop Warner!  Marshawn retired at the the top of his game and the top of his popularity!  The league didn't want a small market team like Seattle winning back to back Super Bowls!  It crushed our team and it crushed our city!  I am glad to hear that Cam got his guaranteed money!  I have not been to a game since.  My sister said that Seattle winning a Super Bowl was second only to the return of Jesus.  Brady went from a loser to Super Bowl MVP while sitting on the bench? I do watch your videos and you do a great job!!!
Flem you did it again bro, one of the high points of my week is when you post these. :)
Hello good night thanks for vidéo good bless you end your famille Holà que pase feliz noches beyos jobenes Dios les bendiga i les guarde sienpre seles quiere ana s g.gonsalez
Coming from a 9er fan I hated this guy, but damn did I respect him.
When Seattle chose to throw a short inside pass instead of running the ball in the Superbowl against the patriots, I knew this game was scripted.  All entertainment sports that involved a third party such as a referee/stewardess can be rigged!
What happened to Flem Lo Raps Raps??? People move on and do other things with their lives! Can we get some better titles homie?
A true legend that in my eyes will always be the best safety that has ever played this sport 💯 Shout outs to my boy BAM, BAM!
Being a VT fan, he's what made me a seahawks fan.
I was at that running event he put on. Did a 5k. The rona kinda ruined 2020's run
Give me another corny intro plz
Can you do one on Ruben Randle
ONE PLAY CALL RUINED WHAT WOULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK TO BACK CHAMPIONS FOR THE SEAHAWKS AND THT ONE PLAY IS WHAT BROKE UP THE "LEGION OF BOOM" AND BROKE UP WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DYNASTY!!! BUT EVERYONE LOST FAITH IN PETE CARROLL AND JUST COULDNT GET OVER THT LLAH CALL AND LOSING THEM A 2ND STR8 SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP AND RING!!! And also lost them Marshawn Lynch who couldn't get over tht play call either and not getting the ball with 1st & goal on the goal line....
1 yard smh. A game of inches
Another player who plays like that is our saftiey tyrann mathieu the dude is a beast
As a PNW sports fan, and life long Seahawks Fan. Kams retirement was harder than losing Sherman, or Earl. Because Kam always played selflessly... And like Marshawn his play style amplified the team, and the whole Stadium.  I wear a Kam Jersey most Sundays, and he will always be the heart of that championship and the LOB. Thanks for helping bring the story of the man and the player to more people.  Love the Content!
I miss watching him play! He made every game so fun to watch. I wish him a great life and he will always be BamBam Kam! He is forever a SeaHawk!!!!!!!
Do Vincent Jackson R.I.P
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I asked myself that same question. Why didn't they just run the ball?
Great amazing video! Miss you bam bam
One of the all time fav's
All time favorite youtube channel and all time greatest Seahawk. I named my son Chancellor because of him. Appreciate the video my man.   Edit: Please do a video on the recent fall of Earl Thomas. It's been so unfortunate where hes ended up yet you cant feel too sorry for him doing this to himself. Maybe he'll see the video and itll inspire his redemption.
What happen to Terrell Owens
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
I'm reppin Bam Bam's jersey forever. Bro has tattoos on his shoulders to "leave a mark" on ppl who have to take The Enforcer's hits. Off the field he's the nicest, most caring dude out there.
757
Ayo Flemlo great video and I love that you finally gave kam the respect he deserves I think that you should do Philip rivers next
OUR GUY FLEMLO IS ON TRENDING!!! AYEEEE 💪💪💪💪💪
Post some last chance u basketball thoughts
Flemron
After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell.  How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever.   Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven?   Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven.   Salvation Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). He also said, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven.  Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  Deserving hell for sins Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Repent So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.  No other way  If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked "Jesus Christ." There is no other entrance.  By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe  All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:10-11 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
seattle legend, still ina city too 🙌🏽
Oh just to add I can never get sick of.... CUE DA WAYNE!!!
FlemLo is my dude broooo his vids surpass everyone else!!!
Flemlo deffinently top 10 youtube channel this man is gifted keep giving us these gems bro
What happened to Ha Ha Clinton Dix saftey out of Alabama. He’s in-line to be the next all pro saftey - honey badger
Gravediggers gon’ be the next LOB.
I always thought he was the leader of the LOB happy to see this vid!!! One of the hardest hitting safeties to ever exist, very similar to ed reed
I knew the game was over after Kam made that hit in SB 48.  He should have won MVP because he set the tone.
that Siny - Orange track you drop in the middle of the video...perfect. Great video! Always glad to see an in depth analysis of a player part of LOB.
Bro I asked for this video for so long thank you awesome vid
the real GOAT!
That was amazing man bravo 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Man I've been a seahawks for years and he's so underrated especially by those who aren't hawk fans. So sucks that his career got cut short
Brings tears to my eyes, loved every second of LOB
TRUTH!  Preach it!  LOVE.
Well written and presented. Thanks for it.
LmFao @ 12:26 that Boy saw a gigantic booger or slimer on steroids in his Peripheral vision  n was "not adding to his highlight reel" tho he did
What are you saying when you hold up two hands and grunt that word after you read your ad? I can't understand it. Whats the point. Please explain and please stop doing that. I'm a fan......I like your act but that word(s) has me befuddled. Thanks.
The GOAT of all safeties 🐐
Kam is so loved in Washington state. He shoulda been MVP in the first super bowl.  There is one thing that does need discussed, though. The Seahawks did have a 10 point lead on the Patriots and sadly the defense did let Brady score and get ahead. Injuries in that game (Jeremy Lane in particular) didn't help, but the offense never should have been in a position to need that last attempt at a winning touchdown. My opinion is the LOB ended in that 4th quarter.
I’m a raven fan thru & thru however that Seahawk legion of boom was the best in their time. We I bmore like defense as you all know.
Man, your video production quality has gone through the roof since you started your videos. Kudos!
Thanks for doing this video.  One of my favorite Hawks of all time.  Up there with Kenny Easely, Curt Warner, and Steve Largent.  Crap, left Marshawn off that list.
Broncos fan...he was legendary...
Moved me to tears!! Kam will be remembered as the best Seahawk! He was a monster on the field and so func to watch. 🐐  Thank you for an amazing video👊🏻
Glad you did one Kam Chancellor, he was one of favorite safeties to watch
... I still can't believe the Seahawks ran the ball.
THIS NEW SET UP 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song at end of video (and throughout the video and a lot of the other videos)????
BAM BAM KAM a future HOF 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I miss Kam🤧 glad im a Hawks fan and watched that D for year just punish opposing offenses, the poor bears played sesttle and punted 10 times in a row
Yes, well said. Totally deserves this
ill never forget when he leveled little Julian Edleman in the SB and Edleman pops right up and keeps running lol,should do a video on Edleman ,undersized small school QB in college, drafted in the 7th round as more than likely a special teams prospect,he took advantage of his opportunities making big plays recieving punts and filling in for Wes Welker as a slot receiver when Welker got hurt ,I remember calling him mini Welker lol than he did so well they let Wes Welker walk and gave the WR1 job to Edleman and he becomes one of the GOATs favorite targets and adventually wins SB MVP
Yo Lo..? I hope Kam hit you up saying that he like this... cause this ain’t nothing but big up..!!!
That panthers kicker flopped
The charming detective arthroscopically encourage because lute simulteneously wail per a calculating notify. well-to-do, marked pansy
Great video on one of the game's greatest safeties, "Bam Bam Kam". As a lifelong Seahawk fan, it's a hard choice between Chancellor or Kenny Easley as Seattle's greatest safety. I'd l;ikely give Easley a slight edge because he had more INT's, but what a pair of safeties they both were in their prime.
That was one of the best defenses of my lifetime, right snack dab behind the 80's Bears
Man as a die hard Niners fan, I hated the LOB, but I respected the hell out of them. They brought they're lunch pails every damn game, and you knew somebody was leaving in a body bag. 🤕💀⚰️🚑 That rivalry is still fierce.
I knew he was a beast, but didn't know how selfless he is. Loved the video and now I love Kam Chancellor more.
Watched the Legion of Boom go to the Legion of Whom in one offseason
My man Lo
Not a Seahawks fan but 6 years later I still can’t believe they passed the ball!
Seattle was visibly worse (at least defensively), when Kam went down
Cam chancellor is the type of guy you have to respect, putting his money where his mouth is to help others and not using social issues to elevate his own status.
I'm a Virginia Tech fan, he was so much fun to watch and such a great hitter, glad he had a great career in the NFL
FlemLo never misses.
ET was the soul, Bam Bam Kam was the muscle and Sherm was the heart of the LOB. Browner, Maxwell, and Lane didn’t get any shine but they played big parts too.
THE best SS of his generation and the muscle of the greatest secondary of all-time
Definitely will be a Hall Of Famer one day.
He hurt his neck, the end. No drama.  Hardest cracking safety of his era and last of the bone crushers
Kam was my favorite player behind Beast mode on that dominant SB team... RIP Vernon Davis
I was part of the boy’s club when boys were the only ones in  Great program to keep kids out of trouble
DAMN FLEMLO YOU DID THAT !
Ray Lewis was a villain. He murdered some one. Google it.
The defense that made me cry ..😞yes ima Broncos fan
Killa Kam made receivers shit their pants! Gee Scott interviewed him during off season's and would comment on how much weight Kam would lose due to his style of play!
Love the fact that you appreciate him while he's here, that's real
757 Legend ✊🏾✊🏾
One of my favorite players of all time! Absolutely goated safety. Hated to see him retire so early
My favorite safety and I'm a Saint's/LSU dude
Billy Ado looking a$$
Nomo juice:ie.Shawn Merriam
I live in Seattle and kam was my fav seahawk since he took the starting job from milloy
Ezekiel Elliott got him!!!
My favorite all time Seahawk. I am pretty sure he still lives here in western WA. We still think he hung the moon, is super missed on the field, and much loved by us Washingtonians.
Bro, how could you not put that hit Kam put on that Cardinals pulling RT in here or him putting that Green Bay TE on his ass in the hole? I, for sure, thought you were going to put one of them in there when you said, "He hit anything moving."
Him and Bob Sanders these guys would knock dudes block off.
Grew up 1 street away from Kam.
Bam bam
Cant front tho.. Browner was layin wood out there too in the early legion of boom days. Kam and Browner were the hardest hitters in that secondary.
The way you pronounce Norfolk bothers me lol
Another fire video from flem... I do feel that 20 tackle decrease at vt is solely that switch from rover to fs .. rover in the box 9/10 times
Cam is one of the best football players ever!!!!!! ..I am a Denver fan but I can’t hate on any Pete Carrol team...USC fan here...
He was a BEAST. I miss seeing Cam on the field. :(
This mans basically my favorite defensive player ever. Damn near cried when he had too retire due to his neck injuries. Crazy how good he was despite how soft the league has become. Inspiration.
Bro what a solid dude
When I talk about safeties, Kam is always at the top of my list with the best.
The hit on vernon davis would have you lookin both ways at home 😄...damn good episode
BAM BAM Kam
His match vs Gronk was great to see
He still lives in seattle and goes to the seattle training facility and works with the young guys
My favorite safety of all time this dude was so cold
You should do a video on Brandon browner. Or Dennis dixon
The question I’ve wondering is if Seattle would’ve scored the TD in the Super Bowl and won another super bowl if that would help more of the Seahawks make the Hall of Fame.
This man got me to love the Seahawks forever
The tidy slope histochemically attach because tune totally snow before a polite united kingdom. low, debonair camera
“Cue the Wayne!!!!!” Never gets old🔥
L O B!!!!
Word on the was curve was , he slept with Russell first wife and the hawks canned
Work your magic on Rich Gannon
Favorite NFL player of all time. Got really into football Russell's rookie year, became a huge fan of him and Earl...
This is great
Incredible video my man!
Virginia tech  hookie nation
G-d damn Pete Carroll and the worst play ever called, what a Dynasty destroyed. Truly, they haven't recovered yet.
Who also misses the L.O.B
What a vedio Man U could tell the work u put into them keep grinding bro
Great video as always bro, I'm not even a Seahawk fan but was a big fan of this man
Kam almost killed Vernon Davis
How tf is devin hester’s opening kockoff return not the “fastest points “ in superbowl history?!!???
As a pats fan, I felt like Seahawks should won that Super Bowl hands down,  but as the nfl aspect how they value money in position, the views, the end game, the story line and so on. They want qbs to make more money than any position because they are the “leader of group, the face of the franchise or the nfl”. So if a rb score a td on a big stage and end game, his value will go sky high. So I am guessing Seahawks front office must of knew that and told whoever calls the plays for em’ that they value and trust on r.wilson to finish that game and earn that big money, have a storyline of qb vs qb the showdown of taking down the goat. And which qb can end the end game. Even tho they knew 99% chance they could of had that td with beastmode!
As a Broncos fan I have the utmost respect for Kam. Fantastic athlete and human. I wish Denver would have drafted him... Also, as a fellow former Safety he is number 3 on my top 5 list: 1. Troy Polamalu 2. John Lynch 3. Kam Chancellor 4. Brian Dawkins 5. Ed Reed
I miss my old team bruh, the legion of boom, Doug Baldwin, jermaine kearse, golden tate. Amazing team bruh
As a Seahawks fan, man I miss Kam
Could you do a vid on A.J Green, he was a great wr and has had a tough career, I think it would be perfect timing cus he just signed a new contract
Ur locks look super spiffy in this video, are you permanently combining them? If so, what method are you using
Enjoy your work! How about a piece on Isaiah Wilson? That story is a fascinating train wreck....
Cool dude too, he was at a pow wow in the Seattle area and was down to earth.  Even danced with the Natives.
Kam was lowkey one of my favorite all time safeties in the game (Patriots Fan). Wish he couldve kept going but smart move on him. Can't give up your health.
Thanks for the video. Mad Love Cam
LOB- Sponsored by Adderall
Was sitting in the hawks nest when he laid that hit on Vernon Davis. Still to this day, that memory plays rent free in my head
I do believe that Kam Chancellor was the reason why the Legion of Boom was a defensive nightmare to go up against in Madden
Bam bam will alway be one of my favorite hawks 31 🔥
Bam Bam getting some damn respect
...He taught Demaryius Thomas how to fly 😯
That Vernon Davis hit...
This is the kinda video that makes you wish there was a "Love" button. Awesome job dude. You did a great job honoring Cam
Brandon browner gave us grit too
MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT THROWGOD!!!
Fire 🔥 video just when you was thinking FlemLo raps can’t get no better then what he is then he hits me with a video of my favorite player of all time.....DOPE
So late on this, but still here for it. "CUE DA WAYNE" 🍿
18:48 where can I get those black shoes at? Looking for a friend🙏🏿
VT is home. Yeah!! DAMN!
Simply the best
This is one of the best documentaries I've seen bro, I had to subscribe. Keep up the good work fam
Flem using the miles Dawkins 24/7 piano

🔥 dope ass video Flemlo love this dude!!!!  Love these vids man doesn’t matter what’s going on these vids always lift me up, I’m sure everyone on this channel says same thing thanks Brotha🙏
Just ask vernon davis how scary kam bam is
He was hitting too hard and it caught up to him. He really should've been the MVP of that SuperBowl but Malcolm Smith had a Pick6.
Jan actually dislocated demarius Thomas shoulder on that play so....
he retire because the NFL suck now lol
Still 757 till the end
Love from London 🤝 we need that Last Chance U Vid fr
We gonna get a last chance U ? Video
Kam Chancellor did change Vernon Davis career after that hit in the NFC championship Vernon was never the same😭
You gotta do Philip Rivers bro. He was a beast
The regular apparel coincidentally bat because mexican evolutionarily spell after a nondescript bass. devilish, cool reminder
Love the vids flem
Kam always reminded me of a bigger Brian Dawkins.  Both were the heart and soul of their defenses and tore the soul from offensive players with their hits.
I'm so happy you made this video.
As a Seahawks fan, thank you for doing this one!
BAM BAM KAM A GOAT
What song does he use for the instrumental? 17:00
Thank you for make this video
Can you do Cadillac Williams?
Love watching your videos man one of the very few YouTubers wear I’ll give there video a click everytime
Cam was the second coming of Sean Taylor
I’m a close family friend with cam, you did I perfect job of explaining his story. Respect fam
Cam would be a great coach one day he’s a leader of men
Why do a “what happened to” video for Brandon Browner, cuz we know now that he is in prison.
Real ones know he was the heart and soul.
This better than anything on espn
The 58 dislikes have to be salty broncos fans right? Great vid as always flem
We need a Ronald Steele video. Definitely a story
Definitely one of my favorite videos because hes not talked enough especially since he had so much potential
Great video man I’ve been wondering what had happened to Kam Chancellor👍
Bruh i miss him and sean taylor so much they could never be replaced!!!
Flemlo with yet another banger! Give this dude some bread and let him go to work on a full-length doc. Netflix and Hulu would be in a bidding war for that joint!
Your videos are amazing brother. Keep it up!
Kam was great and should be a HOF but Ronnie Lott is the GOAT and if you’ve ever played safety and studied the position you know exactly what I’m talking about .
They all better be in the HOF (L.O.B
Kam is one of the best defensive players in postseason history. And the only reason the hawks lost SB49 is bc injuries decemated their defense. Kam,Earl,Sherm, Lane, Avril concussion killed that game
HOF safety, dude was a game changer regardless of stats, simply being on the field made offenses play scared
BAM.....BAM
My all time favorite player, can't wait for this
Always thought he would make a surprise return like beast mode but unfortunately his body could no longer take it.
Great video.  He's my favorite Seahawk of all time.
as a lifelong seahawks fan thank you so much for devoting one of your episodes to kam chancellor! after all this time I think he has not gotten all of his due credit. love your high quality content FlemLo, keep it up!
lol I had a friend who loved the LOB so much he made me hate them. Kam the most cause he seemed TERRIBLE to play against
Can not emphasize enough how much talent a player has that can come in as a high school QB then start at a major D1 school as a corner or any D back as Freshman. That is crazy.
Kam was a true monster, what's crazy is, I first noticed how good he was on MADDEN, then when I watched him in a real game, I was like wow, this man really is that good ! Kam is a true mvp imo
Legion of Boom aka Legion of Pass Interface. But yes, Kam Chancellor was the 2nd best Safety Seattle had. Hit Vernon Davis so hard he forgot what his hands were for.
As a long time Seattle fan this video made me sad 😔
idk if you did one on LaTrell Spreewell, but with the knicks actually winning games, now would be a good time.
Ayyyye put some respect on JMU 😤
Bad ass vid
N.F.L Not.For.Long
Love What You Do Bro!!! So Appreciative!!!! Love The New Setup As Well!!!
Crazy to think he’s probably going to the hall of fame off of 4/5 seasons.. w/o flashy statistics
Bam bam kam
Dude is a 1st ballot HOF imo. Seahawks did Thomas dirty, every other member of the Legion got paid except Earl.
Hell yeah  bam bam kam my favourite strong safety player of all time !! Gohawks  🏈🏈🏈🏈
That poor EV RE20, man. You must be yelling into that mic pretty loud to do that to her, damn.   I guess being a Cinci fan be like that sometimes though, right?
Thank you for sharing what Seahawks fans know about Kam with the rest of the world.  He is the definithion of leadership and compassion.  BOOM!
Screw this Kam Chancellor.  - 49er fan 😭
7️⃣5️⃣7️⃣that boy represented the city 💯💪🏼
As a Cardinals fan it was terrible vs LOB 2x a year. Loved Bam Bam tho
It got so loud in Seattle that the only thing you could hear was Kam Chancellor hits
Rumor has it Vernon Davis, still checks under his bed at night for Kam.
Hey Flem, great video like always.   Keep up the good work
I have such a hard time finding it. But they are a video of jimmy Graham straight running away from dude. Lol
Kam made the biggest hit of SB 49 when he walloped Edelman in the 4th.  The hit was so hard, I was sure Edelman wasn't going get up and wasn't too sure Kam was going to get up either.  As it turned out, both were able to walk away and continue playing. Tough hombres.
I liked everyone but sherman on that roster, he was more along for the ride than anyone else on that defense but acted like HE was the reason that defense was good. Smh Bobby Wagner and Kam Chancellor alone though, and they had Brandon Mebane up front clogging the run, they had a squad. I was hoping Earl would've worked out in Baltimore.
757 STAND UP!
1 of THEE most stupidest play calls of all time. A pass play on the 1 with 2 time outs left plus it was only 2nd down. 🤦..i really wish Russ would've did an audible & switch it to a running play or QB sneak.
He hits so hard, I thought he was a linebacker...🥴
Not only was he such a good hitter, he played as clean as you could, never had issues with those typa things
My fav safety ever, so sad that he went out like he did
The zippy energy genotypically beg because tuna generically travel without a deep jennifer. detailed, lopsided estimate
Bam Bam was a BEAST in that DEFENSE!  He put the boom in boom stick!  Straight nasty, but not dirty... well, not always dirty.    Love yah, Bam Bam!  Heartbroken with how you had to retire early...  Go Hawks!
Great one as all ways
Damn, my guy. You did this man a real solid 💯. Big time LOB fan and even bigger Kam “Bam Bam” Chancellor fam. Glad to see and hear he’s doing ok. From Mississippi with love. We outchea!!!
i surprised u didn’t mention the shooting at VT that he was there for
Man this was so needed kam was my favorite player ever hate how his career ended it was heartbreaking
Bam Bam
I just found out about your videos. Wow, you do an awesome job. Keep up the great work.....Salute!!!
Used to go crazy with him in Madden
I'm a cardinals fan,  but damn,  respect to cam!   He's an amazing person
My favourite player of all time
U mean the.legion of doom.  Lol, they lost that since the pats defeated them
He was the next sean T
Love your videos...also really love that Saint Claire song...first time I heard it I had to Shazam it. That melody real calms me down when I've had a stressful day.
Flemo talking about shaving his balls after the intro is very uncomfortable.
757 baby VA we always produce some of the greatest athletes
I've waited so long for this video
NORFOLK VEEEEEEEEAAAAAA!!! 757 Hell Yea!!!!  Yo Flem this the best damn segment ever!!!! Thank you sir!!!
I really miss kam :(
always my favorite member of LOB. Always did all his talking through his play on the field.
Definitely was an interesting story.  All these years I thought Earl Thomas was the leader of that defense due to being the most talented member in that secondary.  This story gives a lot of context.  Kam seems like a silent leader type.  Listening to his willingness to sacrifice for others, it seems clear how his dynamic would hold a group of personalities like Sherman and Thomas together.  Thomas especially whom seems a bit enigmatic.  That defense fell apart when Chancellor retired.
Solid vid bro,  dude is an inspiration!!
VA was goodie
Most physical safety I ever seen. No safety was as big and strong as him
Been waiting for this I been looking for this 😂😂😂😂
I don’t even watch football, but I love these videos. This one was really touching!
I'm not a Seahawk fan at all but I love defense and I am a big LOB fan. Kam Chancellor is the man. I wish my team drafted him. Thanks Raiders SMH
Good show Flemlo
What happened to the podcast
Code name: Black Manta
Your videos rock man.  Love the content. 💪
I knew Chancellor was a beast, but I had no clue dude was a legit hero. His on-field work is obvious, but what he does off the field says so much more about the man. I'm a Bucs fan for life, but this man's stock is top tier in my book. I hope karma remembers this man fondly, and he and his family reap the rewards of his hard work and integrity. Thanks for putting a spotlight on one of the best skill position players ever.
a==+++++++
round5
133
I'm not a fan of the Seahawks, but because of you, I got to find out about Kam...an inspiration to young men out there. Thanks so much!
I love dis video thx for doin a vid on THE LOB i got all da LOB  jerseys hope Jamal Adams becomes as good as BAM BAM🤧
He reminds of ronni Lott and rip Sean Thomas
Do this for the other Seahawks team earl thomas maybe rIchard marshal running back etc...
He was the next ronnie lott
BOOOOOOOOOOM
Great story love it bro 🔥🔥🔥🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
Bro I’ve been waiting on this one!! Shaun Alexander next? I’m a diehard Seahawks fan
I used to work at a Quiznos in Blacksburg when he was at Virginia Tech.  He came in a couple times when I worked there.  I still don't know how a slot receiver goes over the middle on a slant knowing Kam is there.
I see FlemLo, I click. Plain and simple 🌊
This may be my new #1 video. Kam was incredible. As a diehard 49er fan, I respected him on the field.   There are 3 plays of his that have always stood out with me. No particular order.  1. The hit on Demaryius Thomas in the SB. I need not talk more about that one. You spoke enough.  2. The hit on Vernon Davis. As a diehard 49er fan, that is the play that ended Vernon Davis being super elite ever again. It's one of the most vicious hits ever by a safety VD went from trash rookie, to being called out by Singletary, to being at worst top 5 TE with Harbaugh, to being a scared TE after that hit.  3. The strip of Calvin Johnson on the goal line. Easily one of the greatest clutch defensive plays I've ever seen. Megatron is not a weak dude. I can always watch that play. Nobody outmuscled Megatron.
Love Kam Chancellor. Great Safety. Good video kid! Good job! 👍
As a carolina panther fan he was the MOST concerning player on that defense to me. They were our nemesis until 2015.
Bro you listened 💯 I asked for this appreciate it my guy salute ....
The Seahawks passed the ball becuase it's a free play as long as the qb doesn't throw an interception. Literally just throw it out of the back of the end zone if it's not there, and you still have time for 2 more plays. 2 more chances for Lynch. It was a risky call but probably the right call. Russell Wilson doesn't get anywhere near as much blame as he should for throwing that pick
I love your channel.  You're a straight professional.  Thank you for all your videos.
He got hurt didn’t he? & could never really recover from it
My fav Seahawk
Finally!! My guys is getting the  recognition he deserves!! Appreciating your great content bro🤙
2:50 starts here
Bam Bam Kam....dude was looking scary with that dark visor couldn’t see his eyes
Seattle will never forget this team, like the steel curtain in Pittsburgh. We gon always rude fir the LOB 💚🦅💙
CTE
It took me a long time to get Madden 20 just because I knew Kam wouldn't be in it.  I liked to keep him at strong safety until he started regressing and then I'd move him to inside linebacker.  One of my best franchises in Madden 19, I had Kam and Ryan Shazier in the middle with T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree on the edges.
..And this is why I chose to buy the Chancellor jersey in the beginning of the LOB.  And STILL wear it every Seahawk Sunday.
What I loved about Chancellor was that he was a clean hitter on top of being a crazy hard hitter. He always made legal and fair shots.
Is the Deshaun Watson vid coming soon?
Dam played basically on one leg in the super bowl. Now that’s mamba mentality of jobs not finished💯
Big Cam!
I met cam at the mall
Ima Seattle native i thank you💪🏽 but what happen to Brandon browner?
WHAT HAPPEN TO BRANDON BROWNER
one of my favorite all-time safetys
Kam's a great dude. He held some really cool events in Norfolk and the whole LOB always showed up in support. Marshawn, too along with a bunch of other guys. All the events were free.
Thank you so much for the KC. VIDEO! THATS DEFINITELY THE BEST ONE YET!!! MUCH LOVE FROM MASSACHUSETTS MY BROTHER! THE BEST SHOW ON THE PLANET!!!
Dude you are so passionate about your craft and your love for the game. Thank you for being so great!
I’ve been waiting for this one
Should been in the decade team... There's reason why he was captain of LOB.
I believe that last Superbowl Seattle played in against the Patriots was fixed by Bill Belichick and Seattle's Coach and Tom Kraft for the Patriots to win . And so do Marshawn Lynch feel the same way. Corruption
Please do a last chance U hoop video
Beautiful videos as always man
Never stop making these
Goddamn, I remember receivers and tight ends abandoning their routes when they saw who they’d face when the ball came their way,  No other player has managed to strike fear into the hearts of his opponents like Kam
He's just an excellent guy... I'm glad post football is going well
Flemlo never fails. Do a what happened to John boyett!!
He is one of the greatest player of all time and I love the other guys in the LOB but Kam was definitely the most crucial part of it
Clinton Portis or Willis McGahee wouldbe a good one
Kam was the big B in LOB! He made the other guys want to play harder. His hits were game changing and Sherman, Thomas and BB all looked at Kam as the rock star of the group. They wanted what he had so they started to throw their bodies around more than they normally would. Sherman started Tackling and Thomas started leveling. After the 2015 season Earl became baby boom and his durability to a major hit. What was funny is Sherman was the one that bragged and boasted the most about the LoB! and he was the weakest hitter of the bunch lol. Great shut down CB though.
Great work and great tribute. Thanks from a 12 who appreciates the pro and college game as well.
Kam reminded me of another Seattle legend who was a fierce hitter Kenny Easley who's career was also cut short because of injuries from the Tidewater area in Virginia!
Shout out great video , seahawks.  Fan been since 2005. Bam bam aka the enforcer kam cancler.
😤😤😤 I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Favorite Player of all time......loved the video one of my favorites. Keep up the good work!
3rd favorite safety of all time only behind Sean and Troy
You gotta use it in the right context and how u emphasize it is very important sometimes it’s HElla or it’s HELLLLLLLLLLA maybe even Hella u gotta say that last one fast emphasize the H and let Ella just roll off your tongue fast
Bro u still not using hella right
Love this channel. Is it me or does Kam looks like Reggie Bush 😂 😂
Damn flem, as an asian and a long time viewer, I like your dreads. I want em too
What happened to Earl Thomas
FLemLo I grew up in the same area in Park Place where Kam is from in the 1970s. And your videos are always on points Thanks !
Favorite player ever. Kam, Ronnie Lott, Ed Reed, and Brian Dawkins my Mount Rushmore of Safeties
Look man yeah Seahawks should have ran it but no one told RW to throw a int. It was 2nd down throw it away.
Do the story of TP43‼️ Troy Polomalu probably has a great story
Kam was the heart and soul of the Seahawks! It wasn't mentioned in the video but when he held out for 4 games.. Seattle was so much worse without him. As a Seahawks fan, it kills me we don't have him anymore but I'm glad he walked away from the game and took care of himself. Forever my favourite player!
Fantastic video!
Every time I play D I always try to channel him, he is DEFINITELY my favorite player! And when I saw this video was up I got hella excited!!!
Started the Isaiah Wilson video yet
crazy to hear other people pronounce norfolk when they aren’t from the area 🤣. its so different hearing it like that but love the vids flem
Go Hokies! Bam Bam Kam!
Flemlo you should do Doug Baldwin un drafted to super bowl champion
Yoooo lettts gooo
From Seattle bruh great vid niggas don't show him no love
Easily one of my favorite players I played safety as close as I could towards his game but like him my football career ended early I had to medically retire just after receiving a scholarship offer from my dream school
Has always been my favorite member of the LOB and this is a great video
Kam Bam Bam Chancellor one of the greatest at his position I ever got to watch play
I remember before the second super bowl the Seahawks played in they had an interview with kam and from that point I knew he was just a different type of dude
Greatest YouTuber of all time I love this man @FlemLo Raps
I’m just a fan , but I was scared of Kam .
My favorite player to have watched all time. Kam was the man. I will always remember him destroying Vernon Davis on the sideline. Vernon was never the same. Kam ran the defense. Bobby wagner took over. But Kam WAS the man. That defense will never be like that again. He was pure toughness.
Most important thing I like about your Channel is you do your Homework 📚 and great editing my friend 👍🏿
Damn that’s sad I wish him the best😔✊💪 having to give up something you love over something you can’t control
VA STAND UP
One of the best to do it. Bam Bam🐐
This made me cry 😭
Kam was one of the top safeties for the Seahawks ever. I remember crying inside when he announced he was walking away from football.
Kam would drop 300+lbs pulling lineman in their tracks. And as you said, he was a completely clean hitter. Much respect to Kam and wish him well with his future endeavors.
Thank you for making this video. It makes me sad that Kam may end up going unknown in the future, but his impact was beyond time, literally. Thanks for giving him the props he deserves.
My favorite player on the LoB. I got to meet him at a home game in Seattle as well, he is still there for the players. I hope one day he could become a defensive coach. This was very well done, thank you for that trip down memory lane.
Man it is so weird speaking about Kam in the past tense. Feels like he just retired yesterday. I'm glad he's doing well in retirement, he's a de facto Seahawks coach now
FlemLo, simply put, thank you! Beautiful and timely portrayal of, as a diehard Seahawks fan, my favorite player of all time, bar none. The man was a warhead in a helmet! He is largely underappreciated but deserving of a Hall of Fame bid. I truly miss his presence on the field but also respect and support the man he continues to be off the field. Long live the Enforcer!
This is what they did to Isaiah Simmons. Freak athlete they don’t know where to put him
Didnt know dude was from park place doe! Its like 2 miles away from me datz crazy!
These videos make me so happy
757
He got hurt and decided to take care of himself and his body instead of an organization .
Hey Flemlo you should do one on Isiah Wilson asap. I would love to hear your take on what's going on with that dude
Spinal stenosis will not end your life. At worst you will get a laminectomy
Definitely my favorite safety.
The Goat just keeps getting better👏🏾🐐always loved watching this guy and the LOB in the 2010s arguably the best secondary ever. I’ve always loved those hard hitting defenders starting with Ray Lewis and then i got to watch Kam too. My game has switched from that MLB with great instincts and great tackling and hit power to a versatile well rounded defender who has played everything from Nose Guard to Cornerback and now resides in the “box safety/Sam/Rover” role with a great knowledge for the game thanks to these guys👊🏾🙏🏾💯 hope he gets a gold jacket💯
757 stand up
In my mind, he is his generation's Kenny Easley. Smart, rarely out of position,  heavy hitter and fierce competitor.  Just a pleasure to watch. Great leader, as well, in his own way.
FlemLo thank you sir for bringing light to these players stories. I learn a lessons from all your vids. Stay up bro.
Ironic park place is expensive in monopoly, but shit real life, like baltic ave.
Bam Bam Kam was the best player in that secondary.
I'm not even a seahawks fan and I loved watching Kam so much. I used to fantasize about him playing for my Packers haha
The Carolina playoff game when he ran back for the td was amazing, the fg block didn't count but the fact he did it twice and neither counted made the pick six worth so much more.
You should do a what happened to tavon Austin even tho he still in the league dude had a lot of hype
Still need Carrol to answer for that play
The last real hard hitting safety I’m saying that because the league was starting to get soft when he retired now everybody is getting penalized smh
Great dude.
Ruined Vernon davis off one hit lol I miss Kam
My favorite safety of all time
Some would give a left nut to have a career Stat line at a D1 school.
Hey Felmlo you should give an update on Isaiah Wilson,  he got traded to the dolphins and then 3 days later they cut him.
plz do doug baldwin
W Video
FlemLo thank you for highlighting the beast, Kam Chancelot (we called him that lol).  He headed the roundtable that was, the Legion of Boom.  Epic era of football.
Kam Chancellor liked breaking people
Bam Bam Kam
One of my favorite safeties of all time, I lived in Norfolk VA for one year before moving back to NY. 757 in the house!
Grew up watching him in college at tech and I just knew he would make a major impact in the nfl.
Probably doesn't have the numbers  but  Kenny Easly and Cam have been my favorite Seahawks. A fan since 1976 Cam for Hall of Fame good show Flem
I would defend the pass call in the SB. Everyone knew it was going to Lynch so they were stacking to stop him. Throw the ball, but throw it to the side not right down the middle where they are sacked to stop the run. Good call bad throw
Dude was a freak of nature... played like a defensive end, covered like a corner, hit like a linebacker at safety!!! Miss watching him 💯💯💯
Vernon Davis took the hardest hit of his career from Cam
JMU, Gary Clark and Charles Hailey naff said
Kam was the real one!🔨
I still think it was inside deal for Seahawks NOT too put Marshawn in a position to be a Superbowl MVP.
Actually, stats are much larger then you may think, with 9 tackles on a cb IS INSANE how? Because he wasn't letting catches, normally, the more tackles, means more catches. So this means, he wasnt a ball hawk, he was lockdown cb,
Yall keep talking about that run the ball thing. If he would've ran it he wasn't getting in. He WASN'T LOLLL
please do brian westbrook
Your videos always knock it out the park
Touching Bro. Sure he would really love to see this
Can you please do one on Mario manningham 🙏🙏🙏🙏💯✌️
I loved Kam. Always had respect for him. I hated Richard Sherman’s idiotic “just had to go political because everyone else’s“ ass, and Marshawn lynch is just a dick. But Kam, there was just something about him that I loved. Another great video.
This one of your best pieces
Looking back on it now, that Seattle defense had a helluva lot of talent. Sherman, Thomas, and Wagner are gonna be HOFers evetually; Kam, K.J. Wright, Bruce Irvin, Michael Bennett, and Cliff Avril were very good players; To top it all off, solid role players like Byron Maxwell, Brandon Browner, Malcolm Smith, and Brandon Mebane. Add into that Russ, Lynch, and Baldwin from the offense, and you get one of the greatest teams ever assembled.
"Kham the Cancellor -- Lord of Hard Checks"
What happened to Ryan Matthews from the chargers
Interesting fact that pick 6 he had in the carolina game is his only ever.
I still see that lick he laid on Vernon Davis 😵😵😵
He was a linebacker who just happened to be athletic enough to play safety. Even tho I’m a Niners fan who despises the Seahawks. I got hella respect Kam Chancellor
What's the name of the song that's your opening music?
Gave him his flowers def one of the best safeties of the 10s
Amazing human! Kindest guy. That entire team will forever be the best
BAMBAM KAM!! Bro as a broncos fan he was the only player i liked on that team, even as they were clappin us in the super bowl
@10:05. Herbert went back for his senior year ... worked out just fine.
Couldn't wait to watch this video about my Bam Bam. So excited!! I miss him so much.
Naw fuk
Best Safety of ALL TIME. He was a Seahawk so no one will acknowledge, but the dude was more than special. You don't get rules changed just for you unless you're a freak!
🔨 🔨 🔨. KAM THE MAN
Love the new setup man!
Real Seahawks fans knew there was no LoB without Bam Bam
Flemlo, you’re one in a billion my dude. Top tier work 👌🏾
33 haters with the thumbs down 😂
Pure animal
I still hate The Seattle Seahawks but I respect The legion of boom
Kam is one of my favorite players of all time. To me in his prime he was the perfect strong safety, he could do it all
My favorite Seahawks player. Go Hawks!!!!
I'll never forget that hit he put on Vernon Davis.
TELVIN smith
shoulda been super bowl 48 mvp
D THOMAS WAS A BIG WR ALSO
Kam is one of my all time favorites
AND THEN YOU AND WAGNER AND KJ WRIGHT
Props on this. He was my fav defensive player on my team and it was sad...1 day he was there & the next day he was gone. Career ending injury 😢 BAM BAM KAM you'll never be forgotten!
As a Hawks fan myself, our defense was never the same without Bam Bam. Yea Sherm Wags and Earl are all HoFers, but without that violent downhill force in the secondary, we just haven't instilled fear in people since. I'm hopeful for Diggs and Adams to turn out similar to how Earl and Kam played together, they showed flashes last season, but who knows if we'll ever see a group of enforcers like that again in the modern NFL.
Chancellor, Dawkins and Sean da most intimidating safety in history (there’s more)
Man there has to be a documentary made someday about that superbowl between the Pats and the Seahawks. The direction of both teams and even the careers of a number people involved in that game, were permanently altered in aftermath of that one play call and subsequent INT by Malcom Butler.
Kam chancellor was a beast! He and the legion of boom would have 2 rings if I wasn't for Jeremy Lane being injured in that 2nd superbowl and that stupid play call by Pete Carroll
Kam is one of those players I’ll never forget
WHAT POSITION YOU PLAY? CAM: FOOTBALL
Seahawks should've ran the ball smh
Easily the most likable and respectable of the LOB. Also the true heart and soul of one of the best defenses in recent NFL history.
Hey @FlemLoRaps make a Sean Taylor video
As a seattle native and a seahawks fan, Its hard to describe how important Kam Chancellor is to us. We had Marshawn Lynch as the soul of the offense, and Kam Chancellor as the soul of the defense.
Forever the heart and soul, baby!!!. I loved this❤️❤️
Watching Kam during the LOB days was magic. He gave not only his teammates confidence but also the fans. We knew we could count on him for the big plays that set the tone for the entire game. Thanks Kam.
Dude was my favorite player as a Hawks fan. he was so fun to watch
Sorry man, I gotta come clean. I skip the song
This dude was my childhood. I’m so glad I got to see him play for Seattle. The man deserves a hall of fame spot
Are you thinking about doing a bryce love video? At first it sounds like an injury bug, but I think there is more
The best Safety from Norfolk Va !!!💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I was a right guard and a blocker on my JV squads special teams unit before I was ever a punter on my varsity team, and my rugby skills really helped me improve my run-punt style. It's not unheard of to excel at a different position.
Kam was one of the best safeties of his generation without a doubt. One of my favorite players to watch
This dude was a monster on the field!! Seems like someone I’d want to be around. Kam hit me up lol
Too short of time.. intense player. HOF?no ..Gamechanger Yes
I feel like the Seahawks didn’t run the ball because their OC Darrell Bevell wanted Russell Wilson to be the Super Bowl MVP so Bevell could possibly maybe get a head coaching job because he could be like hey look what I turned Russell Wilson into after we took him in the 3rd round 2 years ago, just my thoughts
Haven’t seen flem for a while. Why bruh so greasy.
I can’t believe you didn’t do Brandon browner lol
Forever my favorite player, the last of true football 💔 a god among men
Absolute legend.
My man! I’ve been waiting on this story! This dude is the goat just the excitement of watching my mans play! Thanks for the video og
My panthers had a short lived rivalry with that team, and Kam Chancellor was the Seahawk i feared the most. Sure, he may not have been the legion of boom member to get the media attention (Sherman) but Kam Chancellor was the guy who always seemed to make the big play at the big time vs my team yearly
I didn’t even know bam bam was injured during the back to back run💪🏽😤
Why did I think that was Leonard Fournette?????
My all time favorite player
I swear every video hits! Someone needs to get flemlo on JRE
Kam still lives here in Seattle every time I see him I always tell him if he's coming back and he just smiles. He's really the nicest guy but plays like a savage he was my favorite Seahawk
Outstanding video.. Very well done
I watch the ads on this mans YouTube vids
David Fulcher, Steve Atwater, Andre Waters, so many really good safeties. Ronnie Lott, is at the top. But had Cam been able to play longer, he didn't have Lotts kind of numbers. But he demanded the same type of Respect, A real throw back player. Hopefully HOF someday.
Hits On the Best Player on the OPPOSITE Team All the TIME In the Biggest GAMES , His career is measured in moments
Dude, this was absolutely beautiful. Really well done! Thank you for highlighting my favorite Seahawk of all time.
Run the damn ball!
Kam Chancellor > Sean Taylor
No offense but if y’all didn’t grow up a hawks fan, then I just wanna say suck it for not having kam on your team hahahahahahahahahaha
Bro i had no idea about his downfall. That is heartbreaking. I always respected him more than the other LOB guys, and I'm glad to know that was justified all along. What a fucking legend. Thank you so much for this story Flemlo. You could make the hardest dude cry with some of your videos i swear. Never give it up man.
He is why I love safety he was the 1990s of the 2010s
Original Legion includes Brandon Browner
Do Thomas Davis!! Incredible story.
I've been waiting for this shit thanks man I really appreciate 😁😁😁
I need that Last Chance U episode
Your videos are always great but this one gave me goosebumps, I've been a Seahawks fan my whole life and Kam is my all time favorite player. He put so much heart out on the field I'm glad he ended up doing what was right for himself in the end
Kam was THE MAN on that defense. Forever the prototype of what I'll think of for the strong safety postion.  Not only will we 12s be forever proud to claim him as one of ours, I'll get to tell my children how I actually watched him play.
Man i didnt know that kam had to quit because of stenosis.  Spinal stenosis crushed my sports life too and it absolutely guts me when I hear about it affecting others in the community. Glad to hear hes doing well
BRUH YOUR VIDEOS ARE ALWAYS DOPE...KEEP UP THAT 🔥
Top 5 safety all time
RIP LOB
You do put the work in your way of hearing it is great also Cam was definitely a great football player and is a great person as well thanks FlemLo
Y’all remember when he laid Edelman in the super bowl. Fucking crazy that Edelman got up and kept running
Dude was a modern Ronnie Lott
“Que tha Wayne” 🤙🏼
I’ll always stand by my stance that Kam should’ve been mvp of that super bowl.  He hit demarius and Julius Thomas out the gate and the game was o-v-e-r.
What is the cue the Wayne song anyways?
Yo flemlo we still need that video on the Patrick Willis Navarro Bowman duo !!💯
this was my favorite safety ever all time ......... i wanted to be just like him and i also am pissed the rams passed on him in round 3-5
love your deep dives.  I'm a Seahawks fan and didn't know most of this.
Its Nor-f\/k ...
Flem been watching for a minute, you continue to make banger after banger and still don’t get enough credit. Editing skills on point , video quality steady improving. Big ups broski, the definition of a great youtuber
Cam changed Vernon Davis career 💥💥💥
U gotta review the last chance u basketball season for the culture
This just reminded me of the absolutely freakish safety from SC Taylor Mays,  what happened to about him would be awesome. I'll never forget his bowl game hit where he knocked out his own CB to get to the Penn St wideout and proceeded to KO him as well, man was a savage and as an ND fan I'll also never forget Golden Tate laying out Taylor Mays.
can u please do tim tebow next
You attention to detail combined with your smooth vocals makes for a great listening experience. At this point I'm waiting for the spin off series where you write and narrate documentaries. Much respect my brotha keep up the great work!!!!!
HOF no doubt in my mind, favorite player ever.
Something about his all black visor I liked that a lot.
I always knew how big Kam and Browner were for the original L.O.B.
Out of curiosity how did u feel about aj green when he left
757 represent!
Interesting fact, while Earl was wildly talented as a FS, he apparently wasn't always sound in his assignments, and often trusted his instincts to cover up for lack of preparation. Apparently Kam would frequently help Earl lineup pre-snap and tell him what zones/gaps to fill.
Cam From the 757 we Legends on this side. Cam,Vick,AI,Bruce Smith and more.
Definitely up there with Troy & Sean
Cool! He’s from my hometown.
Kam chancellor and dez bryant are my favorite players for their respective sides of the football, kam got me into the nfl, and watching dez gave me the love of it
Bro i forgot all about kam chancellor he was such a beast and truely was the heart of that defense! Its crazy that i forgot all about him!
do a what happen to deandre levy
Why is Brandon Browner left out of your mention on Legion of Boom?  Is it his jail sentence?
He made me watch the Seahawks again, not the same without him
The limping curler simultaneously race because gas understandably attend above a encouraging dipstick. overrated, kindly shovel
That hit by the sidelines vs the 49ers changed the power structure in the NFC West
Awesome video! Keep them coming
They wanted the Kam role back so they traded for Jamal. But as good as Jamal is, he is no Kam.
Thanks for another great video. I was wondering if some time soon you might do one on Isaiah Wilson? It seems already like he may have just ended his career by refusing help from Miami.
Do Sherm and Earl next. Make separate videos for each one. 🙏🙏🙏
What happened to Lawrence Phillips?
Coach Beamer loved taking athletes at VaTech... And he was building a great DB program
My ALL TIME fav seahawks BY FAR! Dude showed passion, and loved his teamates, Would ride and die with them. Been a hawks fan since 94, and this dude was soooo fucking special. Miss BamBamKam. GoHawks! BAMBAMKAM#31
Wonder what happened to Bam Bam. Good video FlemLo
Bam bam Kam, fucking Legend
Kam was and is one of the scariest players to ever grace the field.
Before I start on this journey of this video... I'm a LSU fanatic..lol. But I loved Mike Vick so I watched a few VaTech games in my day... I went to the Navy and was stationed in Norfolk Va... I was soon a guy that found my self paying more attention to VaTech... A great program that has a unique recruiting area that is a gold mine if someone could mine it cause VaTech hasn't done it as well anymore... I will always hold the Tidewater Area as a great lil area of football... Appreciate your content flemlo
Next you gotta do Isiah wilson
This whole time I thought Kam was a horrible person from his hits I would watch him deal out! I have never been happier to so wrong thank you!
I was never a Seattle fan but I loved Kam Chancellor
As a packers fan I've always had a slight dislike for Seattle with the fail Mary and the NFC championship loss in OT but damn did I enjoy this vid.
8:02 ayyy I play rover
The last of the hard hitting Safetys if he doesnt play his style he probably plays longer but he wouldnt have been anywhere close to what he was as a player  Michael Bennett said it best in a Top 100 interview he said when they start looking and comparing players coming into the draft after you that you've made an impact in the NFL
Bam bam was always the glue
Everyone always says that Marshawn call was the reason for their loss.   They never shoulda even been there in the first place.  They had the craziest, lucky catch to put them in range.  So 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️. Lady Luck giveth,  Lady Luck taketh.
Wish he could still play today so he could light up gronk lol
Everyone know it was a neck injury
Fire as always brother 👌🏽
Ur videos make me feel 10 times better, thanks boss 🙏
Hofer ....period
Shoutout to the 757! VA legend
Good to have you back, congratulations on the new house.
Love your vids but shoutout the OG member Brandon Browner. He laid the hammer as much Bam Bam
great video! i had the chance to meet kam while he was here in seattle he’s a very chill guy and a great player
I used to work out at his home gym back in Virginia. He came in one time and was really nice to everyone. He's a great dude overall!
Kam was very exciting to watch!! That play will forever haunt Seattle and Pete Carroll
Bam bam kam 💪💪
Is the background music really necessary?
What’s the outro noise called?
Bam Bam Kam
Why 17 people dislike this video. People just hate for no reason. This was a great video man!! A good man he was. I wish this world had  more selfless people!
💪
This dude has a huge heart I just knew he hit really hard!
I am a 49ers fan. I didn't like the Seahawks as a team. I liked Kam Chancellor as a player.
Nah bam bam and sherm were the main dudes on the legion
kam was a beast
Kam is the definition of a monster
Played against him in high school.   He was a monster
FlemLo is the Sponsor King
That Legion of Boom brings me trauma as a Broncos fan but Kam Chancellor the most cause dude could kill someone with one hit. I look back on those teams very fondly (except for a certain game) and Kam was a DAWG and I miss his game. The dude was the size of a D-end with the speed of a corner running full speed at wideouts half his size, destruction was bound to happen.   Edit: Ayo Flem u ain't gotta do my Broncos like that now we already know what happen and still experience trauma every time the legion of boom brought up
Favorite player of all timw
This defense was absolutely no joke. The more thought I give it, the more I can’t believe they lost that super bowl
Love the content flem! Still think we need to hit up the studio one day
That was good. Just better than everyone else. With prime time in the picture.
Wham bam thank you Kam
Flemlo looking like hes in shape
I love how his videos are so calm
Kam chancellor definitely knows the meaning of a hit stick. 😂😂 his tackles make you say Ouch.
My favorite player of the Seahawks legion of boom era
Kam reminded me a lot of Sean Taylor, really hard hitter that could line up all over the field. Couldn’t run like him, but still a great athlete
miss him
I really loved the Legion of boom days
Once again Fantastic show
You finally madea video of my favorite Football player of all time. I originally thought the Hawks would never get a safety better than Kenny Easley but Kam Chancellor blew up OL and TE's better than anyone I have ever seen. While he was on the field, the other team had to account for him at all times. On top of that he is probably the classiest NFL player I have interacted with aside from Bobby Wagner
Wow! Kam was (still is) amazing! And you are an astounding story teller! You love and compassion for these stories is truly remarkable. (Also, I'm a Bengals fan since 1975)
My VT dawg, always will love Kam, one of the greatest safetys of all time. HOP
Definitely one of my favorite players of all tome
Insanely good player and a great guy off the field. I miss him man
The Cancellor, Cam Chancellor.
Best hard hitting safety ever 💪🏿
Up north from Seattle is a few BC Lion fans... Carl Kidd is just like him
Why didn't you just run the damn ball 😭😭😭😭😭
Ayee flemlo. I fucks wit your videos but u made a video about kam..i stayed next door to him before the draft and he came up..yea he waz booming to hard but i watched him come from the mud to success..u couldve made a video about anybody but him
Had a chance to talk to him here in Vegas last yr. He is the largest safety I've ever seen! He was every bit of 240lbs!
Are you from Cincinnati
Kam was always my favorite player for the Seahawks when he was running around tearing heads off
I've been waiting for this video from ANY NFL content creator, and FlemLo comes through. Clutch as always.
Another classic bro
Sean taylor , steve atwater, ed reed and this monster are my favorite safeties all time followed closely by darren woodson and another dude named ronnie lott then bob sanders adyin breed of player due to way game is changing and rules are now
I miss him so bad... my favorite defensive players
Played like a extra LB but still one of the best Pretty much was suicide to catch a pass in the middle between LOB except if your name is Julian Edelman
The legion of boom suits them since there all a bunch of boomers 😂
Kam Chancellor is my favorite seahawk of all time.
You know flemlo ain’t from the 757 it’s pronounced Norfuck lol
This could be summed up in 2 minutes Age and injury caught up to him and instead of being stupid and playing with his injuries he hung it up
A unfortunate neck injury made him retire
Hamsah Nasirildeen is the next Kam
I remember in his last game he stopped Adrian Peterson in the end zone for a safety. What a beast.
Dislikes are from Vernon Davis burner accounts
My favorite Seahawks defensive player of all time as told by my favorite sports YouTuber of all time. Today is going to be a good day.
I think Kam deserves to be in the HOF. I think he could get in, but it might take longer than others.
Banger video flemlo your outdoing yourself bro
We got a Tyrod and a Kam video? The VA native in me is screaming with happiness. Thanks Flem.
Eh... Just another wannabe Sean Taylor
My favorite member of the LOB 💪🏾
I never leave the house without wearing something 9ers during the season. The hate is real for Seattle but Kam & Lynch were my favs.
Thanks Flemo, didn't know Kam's back story. Another impressive young Brutha with humane purpose. You doing well too get the relevant stories out for the fandom. 👍🏿😎
Me and Kam got the sam birthday
That man is a legend and so are you flemlo. Keep up the amazing work
Was my favorite safety closest to sean Taylor literally
Miss Kam Chancellor
Bam Bam Kam
During the Seahawks training camp, I was more excited to get Kam Chancellor to sign my jersey than Russell Wilson.
favorite player of all time to ever play probaly will never change
How is that the most obvious call and leave history with that dude went maybe 2 for 5 the whole playoffs on goal line situations that year chill.
Watched him through college. Let’s go Hokies. What a beast
Damn man I’ve always been a KAM fan he was the reason I became a Seahawks fan and even played safety position, he was everywhere for me 31 on all my gamer tags and he was the heart and soul of why I really fell in love with football I loved playing it like a pick up game but made me love the sport completely.
Kam chancellor getting the  Recognition he deserves
My favorite members of the legion of boom are  booby Wagner and kam chancellor
Very underrated
Bam bam kam 🔥🔥🔥
757 🖖🏾
As a Panthers fan loved to hate him he literally Wrecked our whole offense by himself that divisional game people say he’s overrated because of his stats but because he was so versatile and could be any and everywhere he could make offenses feel uncomfortable just for the simple fact that nobody knows what he’s gonna do might’ve not been the fastest but he was a game changer and a playmaker
You should make a “What happened to the LoB” video, a dynasty that could’ve been 🙌
My cousin got married to Kam so I got to meet him a few times and almost got to go to see the Seahawks  in training camp if it weren’t for covid. He is a cool guy and had that mindset. He told me a bunch of crazy stories and injuries he had that he played through in the biggest stages
Always used to trade for this guy back in Madden. Glad to know hes a stellar human being as well. The world could use more Kam Chancellor's.
Miss this dude but wish him well. Easily my favorite Seahawk while he was here
Most Deadly Secondary I've ever seen.
Sean Taylor hands down  the best safety to do it. Cut short of life but he was the truth
I’m a die hard eagles fan and I’ve always felt kam reminded me of eagles legend and hof safety Brian Dawkins (my all time favorite eagle)
Bro!!!!!!!!! AS A SEATTLE SEAHAWKS FAN, I’M SO GLAD/HYPED YOU MADE A VIDEO BOUT BAM BAM!!!!!!!! 💪😤🙌
Seattle had great safeties in their franchise. And Kam is Top 2-3 in Seahawks history.  1. Kenny Easley 2. Kam Chancellor 3. Earl Thomas
Glad to know that he is doing well away from the game. Thank you Flemlo!
I still wear his jersey. That man was an animal.. sucks he had to get hurt, I totally understand playing the long term game though. Sounds like he was good with his $ and obviously wants to live as long as possible, good for him. I run into him and the whole LOB in lake Chelan all the time. Damn near every 4th of July on the dock haha
God I love your videos
The logic of the goalline pass was if its incomplete you can still run the ball 2x Kind of forgetting that a lot more can go wrong on a pass with a short QB and a weak WR compared to the Pats DBs
I wish I could give this video 50,000 thumbs up!! 12th Man and KAM is the best!!
Kam really jumped over online twice on the fg block he’s such a G for that
Kam Chancellor was always one of my favorite players, even as a Giants fan. I love the way he played and tried to model my game after his, which he modeled after Sean Taylor I believe due to the fact that they were both bigger safeties. It sucks we can't watch him suit up on Sundays anymore, but I would much rather see him healthy than him be injured.
I'm a 49ers fan and everytime I saw Kam on the field I knew it was gonna be a long day.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏👍way to go Mr Chancellor! Keep it up Sir!
January 10th, 2015  I was in the nosebleeds for my first ever Seahawks game, the team were on our return back to the Super Bowl. It was cloudy, bit of a chill in the air and excitement was brewing around the stadium.   We dominate the Panthers throughout the game, but when halftime hit, Great Clips runs an add saying that if any Seahawks Player grabs the interception and gets a pick six, EVERYONE in the stadium gets a free haircut    It’s 2 and 4, 6:12 on the clock in the 4th, Newton takes the snap and drops back, he passes to the short curl route on the right side of the field at the 20  6:08, a blue blur comes crashing to the ball and starts taking off the field.   6:06, the stadium is shaking, the noise, my god the NOISE is deafening. My screaming is adding to the MASS of sound that is permeating throughout the stadium as 67,000 thousand people proceed to lose there shit.   I only have 1 Seahawks Jersey, 31, I wear it every game, he gave me an unforgettable memory I’ll never forget in my life.
Ikr taylor plzzzz
Favorite football player of all time he was just straight up hard and a disrupting force !
HAVENT EVEN WATCHED VIDEO YET AND THANK YOU FOR DOING A VIDEO ON KAM HE WAS SO GOD DAMN UNDERRATTED!!!
i got his jersey
Manscaped isn't what's holding me back, it's having moved to Texas and everybody knowing how to smoke a brisket and me gaining 50 LBS since being here that's the problem.
BAM BAM #12 this guy was my idol growing up
I thought Sherman was the heart and soul of the LoB
Remember the hit that ruined Vernon Davis’ career?
Easily the most under appreciated player. As a hawks fan I’ll always remember that big pick 6 in the Carolina game. Is a HOF talent, not sure he’ll get in tho
LETS GO HOKIES!!!!!!!
Their version of ray lewis
Dope vid, Do Brandon Browner next?
Kam chancellor was my fav player growing up, easily my favorite player of all time
Amazing work on this Piece Flemlo!
U should do a video on what happened to Joey Harrington the Oregon qb
I did t know T pain had a YouTube channel ..
Bro I miss kam so much he used to be busting dudes heads like air vents
Very good. Per usual
Hé brought the scare factor. He would lay a hit on anyone so everyone would be scared. That is the most unfair thing anyone could bring
My second favorite safety behind Ed Reed
Waiting for the bengals FA response video from you😂😂
ET was the leader in that group and the best player.
Neck injury
I am proud and happy to say that I co shot his wedding. Met Thomas and Sherman. It was an event.
kam injured his neck pretty bad. honestly that's the best secondary i have ever seen in my life and I dare anyone to mention a better secondary....... I am waiting.
As a Seahawks fans kam chancellor is my favorite player ever I wish he was still playing today.Glad he is getting respect
im a diehard 49ers fan but god damn that LoB defense was good to watch even against us. Bunch of savage players. Wish we could get another defense like that again soon.
Kam was my favorite back when I played. And I played linebacker
one of your best videos, easily
Love your vids Flem. I’ve been watching since NCAA 14 dynasty 💯
great work bro
Great video Flem
I live in norfolk VA and ive met kam 3 times he is honestly the most genuine and caring player you will ever meet
Great video
The only guy idc ol or any position you don’t wanna hit with him
BAM BAM KAM!!
Kam was a BEAST. best strong safety in the league in the early 2010s. Kam caught my eye and ear at first just because he has a bad ass name.
This was a really good fuckin video flem✊
Great vid as always, Flem!
What could’ve been with this team, SMDH, Damn Pete Carroll!!! That play call really destroyed the synergy of that team and it all went down hill from that moment.  Kam  Sherm Earl Browner  Crazy secondary!!!  Great Vid FlemLo!!!!
Thanks for the video on Kam! Been a Seahawks fan since 76 and Kam was an awesome player one of our best next to Kenny Easley. It really sucks that his career was cut short due to injury! He was the man!
I don’t even have to watch this vid to know that I’m going to drop a like
Him folding Vernon Davis is forever burned in my brain!
Watching the legion of boom fall apart was tough. I know theybdomt fucj with Pete and Russell after that new England lost
Yo, I'm so glad this popped up in my reccomended, I just got a Kam jersey for Christmas, he may be gone but he will never be forgotten, love you Kam, go Hawks! 💚💚
Great video
Man... That was a great piece. Coaches always talk about setting the tone early... His hit on Thomas is what won that super bowl for the Hawks.  I'm not gonna say this brought tears to my eyes, but it's misty outside right now...
Bam Bam Kam 💪🏿
Flemlo you put out the best nfl content.
Thank you.  The Legion got me into football!!!
Across the middle ouch
I just love your videos. You are the best at it. Thank You for answering the questions to "Whatever happened to". I appreciate your hard work and please, don't ever stop.
Throwing the ball was actually the logical play considering the situation.  2nd down, 26 seconds, 1 timeout.  If the Seahawks run and don't score then they have to call a timeout to stop the clock. This basically precludes them from running on 3rd because they don't have a way to stop the clock afterwards, and the Pats defense can play the pass accordingly on 3rd down. If they throw on 2nd and don't score, the clock stops, which means they can confidently run or throw on 3rd and still have plenty of time to work out a play for 4th.
Kam was something else. 🙏🏽🙏🏽
BAM BAM KAM is the GOAT
I’ll never forgive him for what he did to Demaryius Thomas in the SB 😡😡😡
The ring as a necklace looks so dope bro 🤙🏿.
Beast
Wy dislike
Just say it tom brady and the new england patriots ended the legion of boom
Always need a pillar. Someone who holds the family together.
My favorite player of all time
You can legit do one for our whole area(757) you hit a lot of people already
Flemlo with to s doubt is the GOAT of storytelling
Burfict signs with New England
Another great video. you do such a great job at researching and telling their story.
This guy was the reason I started watching the Seahawks and football.
L.O.B. MY favorite team of ALL TIME. Lynch is my alltime favorite player. Man they were AWESOME
KAM WAS SO DIRTY IN MADDEN BRUH I MISS PLAYING AS HIM
Anybody buying the DeShawn Watson massage parlor accusers? Real or a shakedown?
Loved watching him play. Great vid
Kam was beast mode defense
Why haven’t you done anything on desaun Watson yet ? We need something ASAP
BAM BAM KAM🏈💪🏾
Sean Taylor and cam would've been nasty as back field
That Boy Bam Bam. We wanted to play Kam high school but they were 5A and we were 6A. He’s an amazing player and the whole VA is proud of him
Arguably the best safety duo in history! Great vid!
I did bam bam Kam
Kam was my favorite player in the LOB because of his hard hitting style great video Flem💯
The hit he laid on demayrius Thomas in the super bowl when he ran the drag route....... we all knew the game was over after that hit.
Starts at 3 minutes
Love that guy!
That que the Wayne is so old.  Update plz.
Great video FlemLo! Love the storytelling. The only problem I had is how you said Norfolk; it’s just “Norfok” with no emphasis or syllables. Other than that great vid!
Dude thank you for this video, forever one of the best players!
The real question is what happened to Brandon Browner
Bam Bam Kam was one of my favorite player to watch
Not cappin bout real ones knowing bam bam kam as the heart and soul of that defense
I thought this was a video about Kevin Garnett.
BAM!!!
RIP Sean Taylor. Real ones know Kam wouldnt have nothing on u 🙏
Hard Hitter BAM BAM KAM💥
Kam was my favorite one out of everyone in the legion of boom
I'm a life long 49er fan. I remember that hit he put on Vernon Davis that made Vernon a different player. He wasn't the same after that.
I'm a 12 and will always love Bam Bam. Great video. I'm glad I'm a subscriber as the quality and professional production you do is top notch.
Thanks for this Flemlo! 🙏
All O.G Seattle fans miss the L.O.B so much😂💯
Sean Taylor and Kam Chancellor my top 2 safeties of all time!!! Kam made the world Seahawks fans💯💯💯
Remember his senior bowl performance?
He set the tone in that super bowl against Denver! Dude set the tone just about every game! Seattle was so lucky to have that man on their team! He will always be one of my all time favorites
Respect to Kam from a 12th man. He is my favorite Hawk of all time. Thank you for the best years. Great video FlemLo
Kam was my favorite Saftey, physical FREAK! I always wanted him to be a Packer
My favorite safety of all time.  I am very happy you made this video
I’m from Norfolk my boy a legend out here much love
Kam Chancellor was a class player with heart, courage and knock out style of play. Great Story ✌️
Dmv finest
Love you cam!! Keep being great!!
I wish you could do Brian Dawkins
Thank you for this!! I am constantly given crap when i say bam bam qas the heart  no disrespect to sherm and Thomas..but he was the nucleus to the legion of boom...he is a good guy too..he signed a small foam football for me when he was at restaurant with a buddy..i didn't want to bother him and heews more than willing to engage...best thing was, he literally laid out Vernon Davis on Sunday night football...and i complementsd him amd he had a giant smile and said thanks and gave me a hand shake and a half hug...he's huge in real life.. bigger than  he looks ...the half hug i got was great evwn though it felt like he slapped my back hella hard! Lol but im sure it was just a tap on the back
Darren Sharper next!!!!!
It’s a fact once he was done they weren’t the same. One of my favorite hybrids because let’s face it he was like really a LB
This man was tuff as Brock lesnar💀
757 Stand up... Home of the freak athletes... 💪🏾
The real remember him on NCAA football
FlemLo for the win again with this one!!!
I'm happy he's doing well post NFL. No one should have to go through something as life-altering as that
I need one on Isiah Wilson
Cam is one of the best I’ve seen. He let his game do the talking.
Best Seahawk’s safety of all time. I don’t care what anyone says.
Lob best defense name
Man these videos are getting so professional! Really a pleasure to watch the channel grow!
757 💪🏾💪🏾
Dang flemlo U been working out them arms looking huge
Kam was good....nowhere near HOF worthy. Dude barely played 7 seasons. Nah sorry bruh....and I loved Kam but nah
I’ve been waiting for a vid like this
I hate the Seagulls so much but Kam my 3rd all time favorite safety behind Eric Berry & Ed Reed *ALSO SHOUTOUT TO THE 757!
The NFL didn't want breast mode to win the MVP of the super bowl
Can you put more of your stuff on iTunes
My favorite seahawk player period,  humble and a true team player, unlike Russell Wilson!!
Do “what happened to Brandon browner“ next!
Ayy his nephew keandre lambert just finished is freshman season at penn state look out for him he is a dawg
do one about josh Norman when he retires please
Maan you got tears in my eyes, great video again. Man flemlo you need an emmy for your channel. As much as I hated Virginia Tech cuz I’m a Miami fan but there are certain players I love and respect and kam is one of those players. As usual flemlo keep up the great work and continue to be blessed sir
What is that song in the outro Flemlo??
As a Seahawks fan this made me sad 😢
Honestly I think earl thomas was more important. Without him playing center field then kam couldn't come down in the box as much as he did.
I'm now and will always be a defensive minded type of dude!!! Nothing like seeing a real lock down defense very exciting football!!! Not a Seahawks fan but real recognize real  ( Kam Chancellor) is a freaking BEAST 🔥😳!!!
Can you make a video of Matt Schaub!? Greatest QB Texans of all time.
That 2013 Seahawks legion of boom had one of the most dominant NFL defensive I’ve ever seen. Completely annihilated the Broncos in Super Bowl 48. Kam was the heart and soul of that defense
Favorite player of all time I'm so glad you did a video on him.
I miss Kam😢
I like how you never switched intro song dope bro
What a solid, solid dude. Didn't know his story. Thanks and great stuff as always FlemLo.
All hitters get stenosis. Is the compression from the shoulders and  neck
As a 9er fan I really dislike Seattle and the legion if boom.  That being said I always gave the credit for its success to cam and bobby Wagner not sherm and thomas.
Dude, amazing video
What happened to Austin Collie could be a good vid idea
I'm so glad you made this FlemLo!  Kam made me love this sport and truly lookout for my family. Always will be my favorite player in football, and favorite idol.💚💙
I can't wait for the LOB video in a few years
Yo anybody know what's the name of that instrumental that starts playing at 1:31?
Kam is one of my favorite players ever. Super big, really fast, hella strong. Kam brought the “Boom” to The Legion.
Love ‘em
I miss him😞
Flemlo still had them ball flakes still on his manscaped lmfao
gOOD WORK FLEMLO
It was sad that his career got cut short  was one of my favorite Seahawk
There’s only one rule that’s in the modern defense’s favor and that’s the end zone fumble rule, and people want to get rid of that too.
I'd say to cue the Wayne for Kam but for Kam, the Wayne just ain't enough.
Bam Bam we miss you
Que tha fucking  Wayne!!!!
As a Seahawks fan he is one of my favorite players.
He was the definition of strong safety
I’ve been waiting for so long for a Kam story! Most underrated Safety!
Man was the closest to Sean Taylor I’ve ever seen
Dawkins but bigger.. loved Kam... he was more than a beast... dude was insanely effective as well
He belonged in that safety spot like Sean Taylor, John Lynch, and Ronnie Lott. Some guys are just born to hit.
Dude. You’re a damn good narrator. Your shit can be network prime time.
I cant get over how epic your new setup looks
Aye deadass bro i think imma get that manscaped deal just cuz u sold it so well lmao i gotta trust u on that
One of my favorite player even tho he gave the patriots a hard time when they played. Highly underrated player who could be a hofer
Dudes biceps are bigger than my head
Guessing the dislikes are Vernon Davis and Demaryius Thomas?
Great person, great player
I’ve noticed how much your content has progressed, you can tell the passion for football is real. Been here since 4 figure subs, much love Flemlo!
Tech
Had me thinking about Sean Taylor. Both him and Kam had that same commanding presence when they were on the field. Two of the best safeties to ever do it
This the one flem
Kam was great. & let his play do the talking....
Idc if he makes the HOF or not, this man is a LEGEND! All real 12s will always know.
As a 49er fan I’ve always had huge respect for Kam , he was a beast,  I remember his hit on Vernon Davis , I wish the best in the future he seems like an all round good dude
My favorite guy it’s a blessing u shed some light on this dude one of a kind fr 🥶
Dam we miss that dude! Thanks for everything bam bam kam!
Just used the discount. Thank you so much brother I appreciate it. Great video too I miss bam bam cam 💥
amazing video bro the legion of boom got me into footman cant even lie
As a Seahawks fan, Kam was my favorite. Broke my heart that he had a short career.
As a niner fan I hated him on the field but damnit he was always my first madden pick up lol
Been waiting on this for months. LoB. Great vid flemlo
757 turn me up lmao
He was the closest thing to Sean Taylor.   Kam was such a phenomenal player to watch, absolutely set the tone in so many games with his huge hits
Yo I will never forget the 2015 Divisional Playoffs between the Panthers and Seahawks the LOB was scary
I always thought Kam was the heart of the Legion of Boom, I thought to myself he was the second coming of Kenny Easely, you know hall of fame Kenny Easley.
Great player to pick for a video. I’m sit back smoke 💨 my shit and enjoy. Appreciate you G
As a seahawks fan. Just wanna say thank you to Cam & Marshan. They gave us the opportunity to be proud of the team. So again thanks guys
Yes its a bad call, but put the ego aside they didn't shut down brady.  Defence wins championships right?
My favorite defensive player! Kam was AMAZING
lol i must be the only person that remembers kam as a front runner on the  legion of boom. Brandon browner is one i always forget
I'm a fan of your act FlemLo. Keep up the great work!
Crazy how all the hard hitters retire early you rarely see them have a 10 plus year
Kam Chancellor is my favorite NFL player of all time I was so sad when he retired.
The Chancellor of Boom
Badass video, keep it up
Sending this to my brother in law. He is a die hard seattle fan
as a niner fan, I hated the legion of boom, but I always had BamBam on mut
Need motivation = watch one of flemLo’s videos
Man I love your content ! I hope cam sees this 🖤
Forgot about the Virginia Tech shooting & how that effected him. Nice video btw
If you love football and the NFL, you have to love this channel. Unmissable.
He had the best name!
Seriously, I wish Big Bam Kam was back in NFL. Dude was one of my favorites to watch along with Reed, Dawkins, Polamalu and Lynch
Flem is the man with these sports stories. No comp nearby.    That's pronounced "Norfuck" round here tho lol
Flem, just wanted to say I’ve watched a ton of your videos and I’m a huge fan of yours!! Keep doin what your doin my man 👍
That hit on Vernon Davis made me a fan
Top notched video would like a Casey Hampton ep.
What if you did a “What Happened?” To football teams that could’ve become dynasties like the Seahawks and the Legion of Boom
My favorite player might live to see hof
favorite player of all time, wish he never got hurt
Do doug Baldwin
Do doug Baldwin
The one dislike is Vernon Davis lmao
Do doug Baldwin
Do Doug Baldwin
Will always be my favourite player ever
Never been so excited for a What Happened To video 😭😭😭
Such a beautiful heart! God Bless Him & His Family
Some may say Seahawks were given them 2 super bowl appearances
He was the boom in LOB. We he went out it all fell apart.  Miss that crew. Hopefully he will come back to coach. Go Hawks
Do one on Tarvaris jackson
Love me some bam bam
Wow haters dislike this video lames 😒
Badass video
ESPN needs to give you a 30 for 30. Great shit
Finally
Do one on Jimmy Williams, he is ftom thr 757, plaued college at V Tech and was a 2nd rd draft pick by AtL
757
I swear every vid just gets better and better
Bro flemlo u really the 🐐
Kam was a game changer and the scariest player in the modern league with the new rules. My favorite member of theSeahawks and a top 10 all-time Seahawk.
This man was my favorite player and someone I felt a little under talked about especially post retirement thanks flem!
Kam Chancellor and lucky whitehead was the reason I watched football both was a beast
As a seahawks fan, This video made me shed a tear
My second favorite group behind ravens 2000s
As a hardcore hawks fan since 2008 im so thankful u made this masterpiece. Thx flemlo! 2 years worth of fire content ive subbed to
Let go! Pumped for this one, Virginia stand up! Tons of talent has come from the 757.
206 in the house! Killa Kam was no joke!  One of the best ever. Had he been able to stay healthy. Game over.
Damn he’s always been my favorite hawk sad he had to go out like that
Great video as always, Flem Lo Raps.  I learn a lot from your show.
I remember when he held out that one year the Seahawks were not playing good until he came back.
I loved this video keep the good work up
Never respected Russell or the Seahawks offensive playcaller(s) after that amazingly stupid call. Never.
Great video but as a Seahawks fan had to click off when you started talking about the play call...
I think Cam should be in the HOF one day
😔
Hey flem love the channel keep up the good work! I was gonna say you should make a "what if video" about what would happen if drew brees went to the dolphins would he win them a superbowl and would nick Saban be coaching the dolphins still today instead of Alabama.
He was such a violent hitter, that it took a toll on his body. One of the greatest safeties of his generation
Love all the videos bro
My week is always better when you drop a video Brodie! Keep up the grind! Appreciate you!
Kam was a different beast entirely. Reminded me so much of Ronnie Lott and Ed Reed, a hard-hitting safety built like a linebacker.
Shit he was the best one on that defense
Great job brother.
He seems like a good dude. Tough to go out like that but at least he seems to he doing well. Always good to hear about guys who give back to their community!
On top of everything else in his life and career, he witnessed the Virginia Tech shooting
this man was a safety🤔😳, well I'll be damned, I always thought he was a linebacker
Came from Twitter cause I heard there was a video coming out today
Enjoy these videos Flem 🤘🏼 what about a video of Marc bulger.. he has a good story and would be cool to see!
As a 12, I was excited for every Sunday this dude took the field. I loved watching him take out an entire offense and firing up our defense. Wish he could've played longer
Only thing I would change or don't agree with is Seattle winning 2 Superbowls if it weren't for that terrible call at the goaline. Green bay Packers were suppose to win that 2015 NFC Championship Game and beat the Pats in that Superbowl we all know that ☺️
Criminally underrated player
I miss seeing the legion of boom defense
Great video flemo ..my Brandon Browner told he  was actually the reason him Richard n earl was able to play so freely n make the plays they made
Damn that was the best intro you've ever had  😂at least until manscaped took over
10 tackles with a torn MCL to put it out on the line for his team to compete speaks volumes
Flemlo is the best. I'm a simple man. I see a flemlo video, I click and I get educated. Flemlo you're the man.
Legion of boom turned to the legion of doom after pats L
I used to love watching the Bucs Defense play back in the Dungy days. The defense was elite. They shut everyone down!
757 VA🙏🏾🏈
best football.....nah, best SPORTS channel on YouTube
💯 best defense ever bam bam definitely a hof
I remember playing like him in backyard football
Don’t stop doing your thing man
BamBamKam
you should make one on jay ajayi
He is one of the reasons I wanna be a safety
I hope he’s not overlooked for the hall of fame
I'm just here to enjoy the vid, and ofcourse....CUE THE WAYNE.
Always drops heat
Bam bam is by far my favorite safter im a huge hawks fan
I wish you could make one for kendrell bell, if you can enough material on him
Who gives this a thumbs down .. these people need to be hunted down and removed from society...
We miss the LOB in Seattle. I’ll never forget how the city felt during that Super Bowl win. THANK YOU LOB!!
Such a dope vid.
Loved watching Larry Fitz vs the lob
Since the start of last year your videos really belong to my saturday's routine! 🤟🏼
Kam was a dawg coming frm a 9ers fan
Kam is my background
Shit I totally forgot he was from va and park place isn’t no joke
Thx for the vid as a Seahawks fan I would say the legion of boom is one of the best defense
Q it!
Love your videos better than anybody else’s
Flemlo is the best storyteller
Love these vids bro
I LOVE DEFENSE OVER OFFENSE 😢MAKE DEFENSE GREAT AGAIN
How's it possible that I'm listening to your manscape ad and a manscape ad pops up on Facebook. Lol.
1 dislike must be from the 2013 Broncos
That seahawks defense was one of the only defenses that was actually fun to watch it was funner than watching offense at times and it makes me wish I had a time machine😔
Kam Chancellor is my favorite player ever and always will be
Kam was my favorite defensive player of all time, sad his career ended too short because of an injjury
H
So glad you did a video on this as hes easily my favorite safety ever
I miss them legion of boom :(
Man flemlo dude I’ve been watching you for like a year and a half and I love you dude keep up the good work with these awesome vids  , your doing great . In my opinion your doing better than ever
He is my favorite safety of all time
I would love to see a what happened about Ricardo lockette.
Kam Chancellor is my favorite player ever and always will be
I miss this guy! One of the best. Jesus Saves. This easter lets not take God out of it. Like so more can see.
Interesting how all the Seahawks problems in the past 7 years can stem right back to that one play. Fuck the pats.
Thanks for taking my idea and usin it
Kam and Ed Reed are the definition of football players
Kam Chancellor doesn't get a lot of respect for his skillset and his influence on defense. If you really think about it, he might be the last breed of enforcer at safety that we have not seen since Rodney Harrison, Lawyer Milloy, John Lynch, and Ronnie Lott.
I love Kam Chancellor him, Steve Smith Sr, and Peyton Manning are my top 3 favorite players
Been waiting for this episode for a long time.
Love your vids man as a football fan these fascinate me
kam is gonna be one of those players u tell my kids stories about
You the man FlemLo, really well spoken and produced storytelling!
Uhhhhh....Why didn't you "Queue the Wayne"? I feel cheated
Last I checked Pete Carroll didn’t throw the interception at the end of the Super Bowl
Do what happened to danny woodhead
This gonna be a sad one when he got injured it's like our defense died man will always miss the lob
Let’s go!  Best story teller, flemlo !
Bam Bam Kam definitely a HOF
Been waiting on this for like 2 years
hope you all are having a good day
We miss him so much. He set the tone
What happened to Marques Colston? I really want him to get the respect and love he was the number one wide out for the Saints for a decade. Unless you are a Saints fan (like me) or someone that watched Saints games regularly he was a beast!
BAM BAM KAM!!!! LET'S GO!!!
Been binge watching your channel for a few weeks. Love all of the content. Keep it coming fam!
ay doest kam chancellor look like 6LACK's big brother or something
I’ve never clicked a notification so fast.. FLEMLO coming through again 🙏🏿
One of my all time favorite players .. Dude deserves more credit, thank you FlemLo 🖤
Damn... just posted 8 minutes ago and 295 likes already? Everybody on it!!! Kam was a dog!
One of the hardest hitting players of all time, knew all aspects of the game, definitely a game changer
You need to do an episode on tim couch.
I'm a rams fan watching him destroy my team every week was painful but that man is a hof without doubt
Bam bam
Been waiting on this video 💪💪💯 never disappoint
Bruh where tf is your video about Last Chance U Basketball at??
Been waiting for this YESSIR
Top 5 hardest hitting player of all time
New Flemlo video!!
This is one I'm very excited to hear. Thank you.
I think people for get how good the legion of boom  were. That broncos Seahawks superbowl was so beautiful on how a defense is a offense league. can still dominate.
Its 2am here in southeast asia. But who need sleep when you have new flem upload??
The weekend gonna be good with some flemLo binge watching
he was so fun to watch making big hits and plays but sadly I think those hits are the reason for his neck injury
1k views in 5 mins dang bro
He was very underrated
2:56 2+4=7 ???
The legion of boom will forever be a fan favorite for me
I clicked so fast. He's one of my favorite Seahawks ever, we love him here in the emerald city.
I watched your video on GREG HARDY ...NICE STORY
4 views 37 comments? C'mon YouTube.
What happened to Darren Sharper?
Noti
Was waiting for this one of my favorite players ever
YESSIRR KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK  BRO  All my homies love kam chancllor
Imagine dreaming of playing in the NFL as a receiver. First time you go on the field the coach tells you to run shallow post and you have a 6'4 220 Pound safety coming to take your head off
FemLooooooooooooo!
Love the videos man !!
Bam bam is top 5 of all time
Rightfully so, FlemLo gets love for being an amazing story teller. But I want to tip my cap to the research he puts in. I live and breathe this sport and am not aware of half of the stuff in these videos. Keep it up!
MY LEGION OF BOOM 💍💚💙💚  Thanks Flemo

Another banger
Do what happened to Alex Collins
Hi
