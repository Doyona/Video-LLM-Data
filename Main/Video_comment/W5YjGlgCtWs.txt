I go to every Surrey game. County Championship, One Day Cup, Blast. But this was probably the best day I’ve had with my dad at the Oval
Amazing talent 👏👏 future for England ❤
the amount of all-rounders surrey had in this game is genuinely insane
Abott is just amazing
People call miller killer but he is real killer
Who Remember 25 November 2014🥲
Murderer
Guiness  Abbott
CSK MSDHONI CSK❤❤
He also smashed Phill Hughes🥲
Killer of Phil Hughes enjoying his hundred
Abbot forgot he has killed one cricketer bowling bownsers
Anybody heard CSK MS Dhoni CSK
Masterclass batting by Abbot. Well played Surrey 🔥
he hit 8 runs in 11 balls and then in next 30 balls he hit 102  how did he even do that😂😂😵😵
he killed 😂
Sean abott what you did to him😢😢😢😢😢
Season's first and last😂
CSK , MSD😎🔥
3:26 he said csk ms dhoni
3:30 csk ,,,♥️♥️♥️
Sean good played this match.
What a batting display,abott❤
If anyone don't know what is a fixing match so it's an perfect example for them
That was some collapse by Kent
Laurie Evans just beginning to tick.  The definition of the commentators curse!
3:29 CSK MSD💛💛💛
Abbott batting at 6 ? Surely not. He can bat a bit, but australian bowlers dont bat at 6.  So Sean Abbott is classified as an all rounder at this level ?
This Surrey team consist of all bowling all rounders who score big !
Ipl calling abbot
3:27 csk💛 ms dhoni ❤😊
4:47  the English version of psl. 🥶
Vitality Blast T20 is the best league.
sam curran was not able to do anything in ipl
Rcb  ❤
1:45 Sean Abott at the crease.
Sam curren, Tom curran and abbott.. that's a weird looking Middle order NGL
Wow 3:28 Its csk ms dhoni csk

what kind of highlight is this. Grant Stewart hits 2 sixes and you are showing dot balls in the very last over. Atleast cover all the sixes so that we can understand the hitting skill of that player
ICC 0007
17 for 28 to 34 for 100  Last 17 balls 72 runs 😮
England has won t20 wc with this league  Meanwhile india : ☻️
Jacks takes so many wickets because the batsmen feel they have to target him as the weakest bowler
Just I heard is CSK..MSD's CSK💛
Gully cricket k bowler h sbke sb bat pr bol aa rahe h
i played against abbot when i was 16, the fucker smacked me for 5 sixes in an over.
Pitch is literally Highway
MF sam curran 😠😠
He cant bat even at no. 10 batting in ipl
The quality of Australians...❤
Poor bowling 😅
Next year ipl confirm
3:28 csk...ms dhoni... Csk
3:28  CSK.....MS DHONI......CSK
Match was looking fixed?
Why's channel not verified?
We see these kinds of innings from cricketers in T20 leagues/T10 league, rarely in international cricket. Which means there is more pressure when you play for national side. They should carry on this enjoying & attacking mindset even when they play internationals, only then international games will become more interesting 🤔
23 balls-50 (1st 13 balls-14 runs, next 10 balls- 36 runs) 34 balls-100 (2nd 50 on just 11 balls) 41 balls-110 (10 runs from next 7 balls).  That's how inning folded out for Abbott.
Here also comentrator talking about dhoni😍😍CSK😍😍
T20 cricket is a batsmen's game💯💯💯
All boundaries came at the toe of the bat.. No short balls
Sam Curran 👀
Low level of cricket not as much exciting like IPL.
Sean abott come to csk❤
28/5/2023
Will jacks to injured btaya naa 😂😂😂😂
Sean Abbot deserves ipl Contract
Who noticed CSK- MS Dhoni's CSK at 3:29
Those shots are not Good enough and edged Bowling is poor and cause record for this bloke, between appreciation
Abbot is like shardul thakur ...btw lord is lord 😂😂
He speak csk in ipl 😂
3:29  Csk 💛,Ms Dhoni
the editing in this is awful, is there a set time limit to these videos coz all the clips have been cut off mid sentance! 0 flow to the video
Dude who the ef make these highlight videos
This Oval Crowd is not loud enough for the Sean Abbott sixes! He’s playing for the home side, cheer louder! I’ve definitely seen Blast videos where surrey crowd is going crazy
Why didn't Sean Abbott was picked in IPL 2023?
Please rcb take it him for next season year
After this innings no commenter will judge a lower order batsman and cant joke with that bowler
He became famous by the bouncer to phil hughes which has costed his life but this knock made him a hero 🔥
former RCBian😂😂😂
Oh boy, these are some terrible highlights. What happened to the channel?
Sean Abbott should play at no 5 ni national team
Very close to Chris gale's record 30 ball hundred for Rcb in Ipl
And Abott goes for 1 Million dollars in the next IPL.😅
Yae konsa cricket chal rha jaha tom curran 4 number par aa rha aur sean Abbott century maar rha
Flat Pitches and Batting Paradise. IPL teams Could score 250 Every now and then on these surfaces😂😂😂
Sean abbot David willey scoring hundreds in blast and score nothing in other leagues this show how much poor quality of cricket is played in Blast
True cricket not this ipl rubbish........ Might be part of the system, but English cricket is less corrupt 😆😆
Well played ❤❤❤
where the HIGHLIGHTS of other matches . in which pakistan players are playing

Goodness me 13 of (14) balls next 21 balls 86 runs …

Will jacks didn't play IPL and was injured right. How he is playing vitality?
Scoring century batting at no 6 and just 10 over left is very impressive
Bro.. wht the hell is happening other side bowling and fielding is the worst.. seriously the player who threw the throw in last bowl of the first  innings... 🤣😂😂 makes me rofl.
Cmon Aussie C'mon!
He is playing baseball
Wao amazing s Curran t Curran 😅😅😅

Sean Abbott is a bowler
A great performance by Abbott..❤❤😊
Soo clean hitting by Abbott 😮😮
Gud cricket n gud highlights😍 Better than overrated Ipl.. 😊
isn't he is a bolwer ? 😮
Knew that he was a better batsman than a bowler since 2020
what a pathetic collapse from kent, after the two openers did well
100 off 33 balls...fcuking hell! What a demolition of the bowling!
Playing the innings of his life and the commentator barely saying anything
Next year he will definitely get picked in ipl.
3:30
Why don't ECB makes vitality blast their domestic T20 tournament like IPL and BBL. Crowds are good.
Even commentators are talking about MS Dhoni CSK team at 3:28 minutes
13 Ball 14 Run  After ⤵ 21 Ball 81  Runs 😂😂  INCREDIBLE innings 💪👌 100*(34) OMG BATTING 😙
The type of player RCB is finding? He is the perfect one❤
Abbot:  14 (13)  After .... 😱😱 100* (34) 😂😂😂 How 😎
Yaha bowler bhi century bna rahe h abb kya level h 😅
Any One Here Subhmann GILL Fan 🖒💙
Two Surrey games on the TV in back to back days? London bias much 💀
Cris Gayle : 30 Ball Century 👌 Rishabh Pant 32 Ball Century 👌 👏👏👏👏👏

What is that throw at 5:15 lol
Abbot Next ipl 15cr+
Brilliant from abbot 🔥🔥👍🏻 One of the fastest century after chris Gayle,abd , Rohit Sharma  Nd I enjoyed also csk ms dhoni,csk MSD
The only problem with england cricket fans is that they watch t20 cricket as it is a test😂
World Fastest Century 34 Ball 100 run Australian POWER 😈
Most Underrated cricket league
Brilliant Abbott
Beautiful cricket beautiful studium❤❤❤
Sur 87 for 4 after 12 overs then 224 after complete 20 overs  Kent 103 for 0 after 9 overs then they loss the match 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂joke of the day
Bbl ipl T20 blast full of fixing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was a fluke
Wtf. What alternate universe is this? Mm
Looks like the Australians are having a golden English domestic cricket summer. Meanwhile, the English are faced with setbacks. Their patience  will be tested now. It's not the Bazball that matters but the temperament that matters. Let's see how England can endure this adversity.
Sean abbot next year IPL
No women commentators in men's cricket. She is awful.
14 ( 13  )  to  110  ( 41  )    👀   👀   👀
Where is Jason Roy 😢
The Oval❤
Aussie power💯💥💥
It is total catching practice for team Surrey organised by team kent😂 when the are bowling 😂
Terrific innings from NSW Sean Abbott 👏👏👏
Some people mentioned him as a tail ender however he came to bat at 5 😂
Australian pace bowler Sean Abbott scoring a century (110 runs of 41) is a rare acheivement from a tailender.
He was 14 of 13 balls, turned on the easy mode went on to scored 100 of 34 its that simple.
Bowlers quality matters😂😂
Next year abbot play IPL2024
Pure fixing
This dude killed Hughes. Why do people still support him?
Why always every Aussie bowler become good hitter??? James Faulkner, Cummins,
Leading wicket taker in BBL of all time Consistent all round performance in BBL And First class games for years. And yet he is not a stable member in Australian side 😢
Please Bro Upload Rohit Sharma 100 vs England T20 Century England
Please Bro Upload Rohit Sharma 137 vs England
Beautiful jersey 👌why is the indian subcontinent jerseys so horrible... ??
A tribute to Phil Hughes
Brothers sean abott is a bowler or a batsman? 😰😰 and I seen first time the bowlers on top batting line up
huges power for abbot
110 with just 41 balls wow.... that's an incredible score
Superb, no words!!! Amazing display of power hitting.
What a knockk 🔥🔥🏏
I can't believe so many people came to watch this, cricket culture in England is just great.
He Is Bowler
What a level of cricket in 20 blast🤣🤣🤣. Bowlers smashing century. Curren brothers batting up the order🤣🤣🤣
In next ipl auction hope franchise don't give this fraud Abbott 10 cr respect he has T20 100 to his name but he will get 100 times out vs spin in ind
Late vedeo from this chnnl
good job sean
Tom Curran at 4? Lol
Sam Curran at 3 Tom Curran at 4 Sean Abbott at 6 🤷‍♂️
Toder ipl er moto na je sob match fixing hoi🤣🤣🤣
Well played Sean Abbott
Hang on a second isn’t he a bowler?
An aussie smashing the poms does it get any better
It's always been a mystery to me that Abbot comes in so far down the order for the Sixers in the BBL. This innings shows why he needs to bat higher up the order.
the crowd is so dead
🍆🍆
Abbott day❤🇧🇩🇧🇩
Why tom curran is not bowling 🤔?
Dear ECB... Post all the matches of Vitality plz
Still can't reach Gujarat Titan Target ...same day match
This is level of your cricket 😂😂 bowler scoring hundred 😅😅

Never expected such a terrific batting from Sean Abbott
