Y’all this is one of the most heartfelt videos we’ve ever filmed and we loved every second of it🥺 Huge thanks to Vanessa and Veronica for joining us - don’t forget to watch the crazzzy video we filmed on their channel!
I’m still waiting on part two 😅❤
Wowow❤❤
WE NEED A PART 2 LIKE RIGHT NOW!!!
B&B looks much more identical than V&V
This gave me hope. I’ve had a negative look on marriage, but this is encouraging.❤
Why four of you look like you’re in Hogwarts houses?😂❤
I would honestly love an updated version of the four of you girls doing advice in wedding planning and living as a wife
Wedding ❤❤❤
PARTTT 2 PLEASEEEEE
when they’re all wearing the harry potter house colors 🥰
You guysss! When is the part 2 cominggg!😭😭🤧❤❤❤
Part 2 please 🙏
Now we need part 2 since Vanessa is already married woman now!!!!!
It took me a while to realize that these people film several videos and shorts a day and thus why explains why they wear the same clothes in several videos.
Part 2 please
I LOVE RONIS OUTFIT
I think the guys should do a talk about weddings and marriage
Yes
you guys actually look like windows logo with the red,blue,green and yellow
Alright yall part 2?
I’m planning my wedding, I’ve watched this video like… 10 times, 😂 and I just realized we picked out the colors the same way Brooklyn did! 🤣
I absolutely loved this video!
I CANTTTT THIS IS SO SAD SEEING U GUYS GOING IN SEPARATE WAYS
if ever you do a second Wedding & Engagement Q&A bring the guys!
It's time for y'all too try on your wedding dress together since y'all are married then have a Q& A of the boys with y'all
Can y’all do Q and A part two of wedding questions with the Merrell twins please and y’all should try on the dresses this time.💕😀
Do part 2 please
Brooklyn did you feel nervous in your engagement?
We need an updated version of this video now that they are all married! 😊
I do what Vanessa does when someone is talking to me too!
I love love. Especially when God is at the centre of it all ❤
I would love a part 2!
And now Nessa is also married 🥰
NOW THEY ARE ALL MARRIED 🥺♥️
Why did this make me cry so much I've been following both your guys channels from fairly early on and feel like so much has changed I'm still single unfortunately but how cute and special to have such a beautiful friendship and relationships with your forevers can't wait to meet mine ❤️
Love all of you guys but I think it’s funny that ur all dressed in Harry Potter colors 😂❤ congrats to all of you
Ok happy feeling like you  miss you good thanks  Angelina  much  miss you too  yes
i started watching the when Bailey and asa started dating i came back to them married??? so happy for tall
I love the red, green blue and yellow theme! :)
Bailey and Asa are honestly relationship goals!!!
22:16😢❤
19:18😢❤
11:07😢❤
Marriage is so fun. I used to not want to get married but I’m glad I didn’t hold onto that.
Loved this video so much!! Listening to all of your answers and the way you talked about each of your people was so sweet 🥰
I want a podcast of these four. This video felt like my sisters were giving me advice. I need more of this💕
Is it just me or they look like they can be quadruplets?
NESSA IS ENGAGED 🤯🤩
Omg I was smiling so hard throughout this video, they r so adorable
19:55 When Nessa said she doesn't look at people's face when they're talking I could relate😭 I too never look at people's faces...
I grew up with merrell twins on YouTube daily. Loving it. Took a break from watching for a while. Watched less regularly. Just wasn't content I felt drawn to, didn't feel as relatable to my lifestyle and personality and beliefs. And now rediscovering, they feel like these fun, relatable girls again. Loved this! 😍
I'm curious why Veronica got married twice. I like the concept.
This video was very funny and entertaining, I hope you do a second part of it after Vanessa's marriage 💖💖
please make more I think this I my favorite video so far
I don’t know why I realize these things but I love how y’all’s jeans are in a gradient order and your shirts are all different colors!😂
Brooklyn and Bailey saying “that’s so odd” in sync is hilarious. Also, nervous pooping is a real thing. My whole family have that!!! Anxiety and stress does wild things to your body.
I love your videosssss
Wow congratulations guys🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
So I just wanted to comment that yes lots of people say just wait till your married for so long the romance will die. I don't agree I think it just changes I've been married 10 years and yes thats pretty young marriage but I just feel like it changes especially if you have that outlook. We waited 5 years to have kids and had 3 it's crazy but honestly the love just changes with all the things you go through together:). Keep enjoying your marriages there might be some hard times but if you work through them it's so incredible!!
This was great ladies! I smiled the entire time. Part 2 please!
Nessa’s hair looks sooo healthy
Omgggg yessss part 2 💜💜💜
🤩
Manifesting for part 2 when Nessa is married ✨
I grew up watching both of them and now seeing them together and them all being married (except nessa being engaged) it just makes me so happy
What we need is a husband edition marriage/engaged Q&A next? 😭💓
Hearing you guys talk about your sister how you cried after they left made me sad cause my sister dosnt love me that way no one in my family cares I'm glade you guys have each other keep that bond
😍
🎉🎉😊🎉😊😮You are so close to 7million subscribers
Wedding & Q&A Engament ft. Merrall Twins that Amazing i love it hope enjoy Terrell Twins Q&A Engagement 💞🧸❤🎄👏🏾🎁
I don’t believe in marriage, I prefer the Goldie Hawn/Kurt Russell way of life and just being with someone because you want to not because a piece of paper says you have to or else.. But I’m glad these girls are happy with their lives but I AM glad Vanessa slightly added in the “whatever is right for each couple” because I don’t think just because your not officially married you love each other any less. Goldie and Kurt have been together for like 30 years. And I know plenty of married people who are completely miserable. Just something for you all to think about if you ever read this.
I'm living for Brooklyn's outfit here, hair and all!
My favorite fairytale  Disney Princess Cinderella Sweetheart puffy Ballgown dresses 👗 For single ladies my Favorite color  Bridesmaid dresses Red Lavender yellow with  Pink Sash with Disney Princess Hair styles Like Cinderella Princess Bell  Princess Tiana  Princess Snow White
please keep doing videos like this!!! i LOVE them!!!
I am so excited for the next wedding
I can really relate to Nessa not looking at the person talking to you. I can find it very hard keeping eyecontact with someone for a certain amount of time, and I'll start blinking like crazy 😆 I also don't always look at the person I'M talking to. I like look away. But that's mostly for people I don't know THAT well, or just if I'm nervous.
Aww this is so sweet
I already wanted to get married but this video made me want to find a life long parter even more.
This video was so fun! I loved it. All the special little things you talked about and advice you had to give was so great. Yes, you should absolutely do another video like this! Kind of related to this topic, how did you guys meet people/find someone you wanted to date? (This might apply more to Brooklyn.) I'm in a stage of life where I want to begin that journey and find someone, fall in love, get married, etc. but I feel like I just can't find anyone I'm interested in.
stoppp i love this video, it's soooooo cute omg
I really love this video. Thanks for sharing this with us! I’m following you guys for quite some time now and I’m just so glad you’re all happy!
Me:😭
this style of video is so cute!🤍
Oh my gosh I count while people talk too! What is that??
Hearing Nessa's and Brooklyn's stories about how they fell in love with their partners was so beautiful and sounded so healthy! Love these girls. 💞
Part 2 please!! Any fun video will do whether it be a marriage/engagement Q&A, couple challenges, or pranks on your men! You girls are too sweet!
YES PART 2 FOR AFTER NESSA GETS MARRIED PLEASEEEE
PART 2 PART 2 PART 2!!!!
Subscribed from the ness and Ronnie’s gingerbread twin channel
I do the same counting thing as Nessa! I'm so happy I'm not the only one 😅
Fun fact:all get engaged or married within a year of each other how cool
I totally need a part two, it was so very nice hearing you talking about this lovely topic. 🦋
Please do a part 2!! <3 And as another comment said, it would also be fun to see John, Aaron, Asa and Dakota answer similar questions, because we don't see enough guys on the internet talk about relationships and marriage.
Is no one going to talk about there jeans from Vanessa to Brooklyn dark to light jeans lol did they plan that
Such a cute video! Idky but I paused it several times while watching because I kept feeling like I wanted to cry. So sweet. Part 2 please once Nessa is Married!
Nervous pooping is a real thing 😂
i would be really interested to watch part 2 when Venessa is married and congrats by the way for the engagement
Part 2
Yes yes yes for a part 2
Yes yes yes for a part 2
I'm getting married in 14 days (27th same as Ronron)
Love u guys <33
me and my twin’s favorite twin duo🤩🤍
this is my new fav video on youtube!!
I love this so much, I also love that each of these women are wearing Hogwarts house colors
nessa is going to be such a beautiful bride😭im so excited !
Pt. 2
My favourite scene is when they all brought out their dresses and everyone being excited when they put the little veil and bow on her head, omigod. 10/10.
definitely want a part two!!
How cute all of them are in the primary colors
Great video, I was in a beautiful marriage before my now ex wife left me,i still love her and most times i can't stop thinking about her, i am doing my very best to get rid of the thought of her, but i just can't, i love her so much, i don't know what i am bring this here for, i can't stop thinking about her!!
I have been waiting for this collab for such a long time❤❤❤
Want it to happen 27:48
No! 😂 12:21
the fact that all four of you are married/engaged is sooo trippy 🥲 i love you guys sm
Why are they all wearing the Hogwarts house colors?? 😆
thank you for making  such an important video, it really helped me change and understand this topic that I've always ben afraid off.
This was a nice video!!
red green blue yellow
they are literally the same people, they'd be best friends if they lived near each other
About not walking barefoot, I mean, I'm Catalan, we rarely do it. We use regular shoes or slippers.  We can get grounded for doing it.
Yesss part 2
SO FUN! Loved this video!!
loveeee this! and yes, we definitely need a part two (when nessa's married 😍)
My favorite twins all in one video awe ❤
NESSA'S FACE WHEN RONI MENTIONED THAT SHE MOVED OUTTTT 🥺🥺🥺
def need a part 2 please!!
I just got married a little while after Brooklyn!  And my twin sister got married before all of us twins :)
Loved Nessa's question!  And loved this video!  Thank You for sharing!  "Creating a new journey" is a great way to put it :)  Thanks for sharing that pic from the past and your wedding dresses again :)
Omg 20:00 I literally thought  I was the only one who do this,when nessa said when people talk to her she does'nt look at them and she said she  start counting things like counting  the corners of a window,over and over,I literally do this and I dont know how to stop it☺😂
love this and love all of you :))
I do similar weird counting things as Vanessa!
I want more of this. That was so cite
I love this video it is just so sweet. And the end it’s like you guys were play dress up so sweet. Love you guys ❤❤
Am like nessa i be counting things 😌 or looking at different things when am talking with someone else
That was such a beautiful video 🥹
hey Brooklyn and Bailey, I really wanna inquire more about the college y'all attended since at the end of highschool i would really really appreciate if you could guide me
Wish we could’ve had a close up of the rings 😍
Yes please part 2 with all 4 married!!! The wedding dress part got me teary eyed 🥹
Hearing Nessa & Roni talk about their views on marriage is so sweet and refreshing!!
i wanna get married so bad now 😭😭😭
Y’all need a podcast
I love the Merrell Twins, they have such a reverence for God! They use their platform to glory God and bring honor and glory to His name. They are just such faithful servants living out a Christ centered life and I love that. I really do!
I love how their jeans color went from dark to light 😂
Long hair CAN look sooo ratty (dead ends) BUT Vanessa's long hair is stunning! 👌 💖
This made me stop cleaning and i started crying and really thinking I wish my relationship is like yalls happy and loving. 8years and our love is lost and we aren't happy anymore but we don't know how to leave each other. I'm sorry I just needed to vent 😔
TO BE HONEST... if one of them gets divorced, i wouldn't believe in love anymore. Their relationship are so cute together! not that they are perfect perfect but like they are destined to be together
14 years married (married at 18), things do change, but not in a bad way…you just helllllllaaaaaa comfy and they become more annoying but still in love 😁🤍
ugh nessa and john🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽😫😫😫
I've been married about a year. Marriage is like a sleepover with your best friend that never ends, but in the absolute best way possible. (I'm an introvert, and I wasn't always a fan of sleepovers growing up. I found them exhausting. But with my husband, it's great. It helps that everything is "your stuff" and there's no pressure to rush anything, since your bestie never has to go home.)
This is so cute 😭😭😭
Part 2 please but; this time with the HUSBANDS!!!
The best advice I ever got is marry someone who can be your playmate. Meaning marry someone you love who wants to go on adventures with you, learn new things together, and literally play together. My husband and I are coming up on six years married and 10 years together and we love doing anything and everything together
I didn’t want the video to end 😢
So weird that they’re this old haha. Im a Senior in high school but I used to watch them when they were in high school all the time. So happy for all of them 🫶🏻
19:19
I wish we could see your rings 😢
All of you girls are beautiful and pretty
I don’t think anyone is telling women to not get married are they? Is that like a movement? Because I’ve never heard that lmao
Haha i also went to home depot for paint swatches
I had to share my story about when I was in the girlfriend stage of the relationship. So we went to my now husband's sisters wedding and when they were doing the pictures they didnt want me in then since I was just the girlfriend. They said if we didnt stay together then they'd have ne in the pics forever which makes sense. (At the time it kinda sucked tho cuz I was literally the only person just standing there looking like a weirdo while they took pictures but I understood). It was ironic tho because my now husband's brother had his wife with him and she got in the pictures then they didnt stay together! Lol
I Love you guys videos so much!❤❤
So cute loved this
Would love to see a part 2 and love u
Love this!!! I kinda wanna see the husbands so a similar video now haha!
ABSOLUTELY YOU NEED A PART TWO ONCE NESSA GETS MARRIED!!  Y'all just have a beautiful dynamic with one another, it's just so wholesome. I love all of you guys ❤
Didn't skip even a second of the video. I'm 25. And married. And can relate to everything they all said. We're all in the exact SAME BOAT. marriage is such a happy great gift of life.  Shouldn't be missed by anyone who has a chance to avail it.
Bro I have nervous poops and I have ibs lol and I’m planning on proposing in summer and now I’m worried about pooping all day haha😅
wold love part two
These girls' parents are brother and sister.
They were all literally babies and now they are all engaged
Love all the details! 😍
MY SISTER IS GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW!!💖
OMG I have the same counting thing!!!  I feel like my brain just needs constant stimulation even if things are going on.  Wow, nice to know I'm not alone there :)
I love guys
I don't wanna start things, but is Roni possibly expecting. She is glowing 😍
I love guys
Vid with the four boys would be fun!!!!
We NEED a part 2
I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS VIDEO!!! The ending was the best with the wedding dresses! when they put the veil on Nessa🥺🥰 After Nessa gets married you should do another video and all put your wedding dresses on for a photoshoot?
Q: why was this recommended to me.
okay but at the end, why did I thought that Roni, Brooklyn & Bailey are going to put on their wedding dresses and we would've got our Phoebe, Rachel & Monica moment right there!! (but here they are all married unlike them)
i really loveeee their collab, they're kinda have a same stories like ronnie and aaron have known for years same like bailey and asa but nessa and john know each other not that long same like brooklyn and dakota!
taking a moment to appreciate the color coordination in their tops
Yes! We want part 2 in the future 😍😍😍 We love you all!
Loved this video!!!! I’ve watched you guys and the merrell twins over the years and always like the collab between you guys!!!!! It’d be cool if you guys do another collab video with your husbands(fiance-nessa) altogether!!!! 😄
omg yes! please make another video about this topic <3 i really love hearing people talk about love, relationships and marriages!!!
love all the ladies! <3 a beautiful friendship!
I love how all of y’all have grown up into these beautiful successful women as I expected and proud of all of you as a long time fan love you all from Nova Heat AKA Justin
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If these twins looked like Dwight from The Office, this video doesn’t get made.
Against God.
❤️❤️❤️
You ladies are such good role models 💕
Wow I really enjoyed this video. I think marriage has become somewhat taboo in our society and so to see young women talk about the beauty of marriage is really beautiful and inspiring. ☺️
Seeing how great their lives are and just giving us advices and looking how happy the girls are, they’re giving me hope that one day I’ll be as happy as Brooklyn, Bailey, Vanessa and Veronica with my future boyfriend/husband. 🫶🏻
This was the most surreal and sweet thing ever !! Can’t wait for Nessas  marriage! Y’all have made me realize I cry very easily lol
Gayyy aggggghhhhh😂😂
Brooklyn is too cute!
pls tell me they ain't lgbt
I’ve grown up with these girls, they were my inspiration. To see where they are at now makes me so nostalgic and happy at the same time. They got me through rough times I love them all ❤❤. I’m crying I’m so happy for you guys ❤
Why is this in my feeds?
Nessa talking about counting the corners when talking to people. Also her literally describing ADHD in one sentence
I love how esthetically pleasing their sweaters are haha
I’ve been with my bf for almost 2 yrs. I know I want to marry him and be with him for the rest of my life 🥰
OMIGOSH NESSA IS GONNA BE A STUNNING BRIDE 😱😱😱💜💜💜
Your outfits are giving teletubbies 😭
Getting married in 6mo, loved this sit down video!! 🥰💕 Can’t WAIT for part 2!
Part two part two part two!!!! Y’all should do a try on of each others dresses maybe just to see how they look! Love y’all’s videos!!!  💖🎀💖💍💖
PLEASE A PART 2....AND MANY MORE COLABS .....PLEASE 🥺💕💕💕💕
No man could enjoy this
hahahaha not me sitting here with a one round stone engagement ring on my hand lolll
Omw I can Relate to Nessa ! I can't make Eye contact when someone is speaking to me and I ALWAYS count Corners 😦🥺🥺💕💕💕
I've been a twinner forever and a few years ago I came across Brooklyn and Bailey.  I loved this video and I'm so glad that these amazing ladies have found their soulmates. Please do more collabs with the Merrell twins. I loved it so much.
24:20 >>>>>
A part two when Vanessa is married would be fun, too!  You were all wearing a different Hogwarts House colour😂
I have finals this week, taking one today, just had a anxiety attack, calmed down, now I'm watching this video and it brings me so much joy. I love you guys can't believe you're all married or getting married.
Vanessa! I have the same counting habit!
This was soooo cute! Marriage is a beautiful thing! And hoping for it and being adamant about that goal in your dating life is a GOOD thing! Keep Christ at the center and you can’t go wrong! 💛 can’t wait to a part 2! Congrats ladies!
Ya'll should reunite with Matt and Abby!!!!!
Everyone judges them for getting married "young". Like what the heck. 22 or young twentys is not young at all! Getting married later is fine but when it's meant to be it'll happen💕
Yesss need a part 2!!
Yes to a part 2 when Nessa is married!!
Ahhh so excited for Vanessa’s wedding! I want to get married now 😭😭😗
The guys should do a version of this
PART 2
part twooo
My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 7 years. We've had many discussions about not needing/wanting a wedding or getting married.  With that being said I still enjoy watching your videos on weddings and marriage because just from the enjoyment you guys exude, it's very heart warming to see
WE NEED A PART TWO AS SOON AS NESSA IS MARRIED PLEAASSE
L O V E this video, so fun and so sweet!!! Please do a part 2 😁
I love that the jeans go light to dark
I LOVE YOU GUYS LIKE SOO SOO MUCH
I love when you collab!!!!❤
I just love nessa and roni ♥️
I loved this video so much.
With that hair look roni looks more just like her mum! Beautiful! 🥰♥️
I'm 25 minutes into this video. Just realized something. They are each wearing a different color of the Hogwarts houses!!! Such a random thought, but I wanted to share it. Hope I'm not the only one that saw it❤️💚💙💛
This is juicy episode of engaged to married life
WE NEED A PART 2!!!
I have been watching you four for years now and seeing all of you getting married with the man of your dreams is inspiring and so happy for you guys and you guys talking about finding the right man gives my hope that one I’ll find the man of my dreams and a funny is that you guys are wearing your own colours it’s cute and love the wedding dresses so gorgeous
Next time the guys also get their video 🥰
This 4 have their lifes so perfectly aligned  One gets married the other one gets married.
you should have counted how many times nessa said like
You HAVEEEEE to do a part 2 pleaseee😭
The outfits 😅
Literally teared up seeing Nessa with Roni's veil. Can't wait to see her wedding dress etc.
im really sad.. i’ve been watching their videos since they like 15/16 and now they already married😭😭 good old days..
Part 2 please
You guys 😊I Love this video ….. I want more!!!❤
Ofc brooklyn and bailey dress is gonna be similar.... brooklyn tries her best to do everything like bailey yall....
Remake this video but ask the guys the questions 🤭
Sometimes Roni act like a mom to Aaron 😂
I love seeing twin collaborations on YouTube.😌💯💕
I need part 2 !! Once Nessa is married .And who knows you guys can wear your wedding dresses
I think girls admire and like girls that are engaged/married because they are no longer seen as competition. Especially towards influencers. Female influencers will instantly get more love from other girls once they are taken.
I love them so much!!!! They radiate joy
Can’t wait till they have kids, imagine they all have twins 🥰 I think Roni will be first, can’t wait for the next stages of their lives ❤
I literally teared up while listening to Vanessa talk when she knew John was the one. I'm single right now and I really want a relationship with a guy that is just genuinely a good person. Listening to them I have hope that one day I'll find him.
my younger sister (not that young theyre 18) leaves ALL the drawers in the kitchen open ALWAYS and it drives me and my twin crazy but we just keep closing them ourselves
So glad you guys made this video!!! I’m newly engaged and have so many questions 🎉💍🤍
I’ve been married 16 years and have 4 kids. The romance is still very much alive but it looks different than it did in the beginning and not in a bad way…
Wait, Roni’s vail could be Nessa’s something borrowed! 🥰
I remember watching them when they were in high school—— now, they are all engaged or married. 😢
I love how this video is here conveniently the day after I got engaged 😂😂
I love this twin colab! Definitely my favorite ❤
❣
Marriage ia beautiful only when u don’t settle for less or wrong partner thats wen it becomes a nightmare
YESSS PART 2!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
nice video brooklyn and bailey with vanessa and veronica
Be interested to see which twin starts a family first
The music is loud and annoying
I need an updated version when Nessa gets married!!! Love you girls!!! 2 of the best pairs of twins on the internet!!! Blessed, happy, inspiring, everything! 💖💖❤❤
Y'all look like the mauritian flag 😂 Red blue yellow green 🇲🇺
My Mom made her spaghetti sauce with tomato soup and brown sugar.
nessaa 😭 i started crying when roni puts on the veil on her hair, it's just that i've been watching you guys for so long and i feel like i grew up with you, and it's so unreal that i could still see you entering new stages in life😭 hoping for all even the smallest things in the world goes to you guys
I've been nagging Nessa and John to check out Colleen Ballinger's vacant house to keep it in the YouTube family.  Colleen and her husband recently bought and moved in to a bigger, more rural house.  Flynn, Colleen and Erik's 3-year-old son, could show Nessa and John where the good places are to hunt worms and bugs.

Congrats to all you girls I'm so happy my dream will be to be married one day with my soulmate like you guys xxx 🥺🍾🥳🥂🎊🎂
I am so happy for all these young ladies, I wish them a happy married
PART 2 WITH NESSA MARRIED PLEASE
PART 2 PLEASEEE
it's so nice to hear nessa talk about their relationship considering that she wants her relationship to be lowkey
Hey b&b I hope you guys read and reply I wanna ask you guys that  When did you guys first met the Merrell twins? PS love you guys more than anything 💕
I loved this video so much ❤️❤️
the most precious video ever 🥺
the only twins that im still watching until now
It would be really fun if John, Aaron, Asa and Dakota will answer similar questions together😁
so crazy that the four of y’all are married and engaged!😭sweet to hear everyone talk about their husbands and fiancé🥹
When the 4 of you sitting together said hi, I just realized that the short haired twins were sitting in the middle and the longer haired twins were sitting on the outside... and then I thought... is that a thing with a lot of twin girls?  Between my twin and I, I have the longer hair, and she has the shorter hair.  Our lengths (and hair color) are more similar to the Merrell  twins... and I think they've even said they have a little bit of filipino... which is what my sister and I are.
love it
This was so cute
This was a beautiful video 😭😭😭
You 4 actually look like each other 😅❤
Part 2 when Nessa is married plsssssss!!!! You guys are so loved up. So happy for you all. X
This was so beautiful. So insightful ❤️🫶
I wanted to get married young. Im 22 and I feel like it’s not gonna happen for me
😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I was totally overwhelmed when they started to take out their wedding dresses. OH MY GOD OH MY GOD is it REALLY happening 😍😍😍
yes PLS do a part 2!!
Watching you guys together is so much fun...  Make me wish I can find my guy soon
Love fhis collaboration
Since following both Vanessa and Veronica along with Brooklyn and Bailey for years now, they give such a positive outlook on life and so refreshing to watch and hear.
YES!!!! We definitely want more videos like this!!!❤❤
This video is so good! I love y'alls Q&A's!!!!
It's soo crazy how similar y'all lives are to the Merrel twins like how one got married & the other engaged just months apart. I also see a lot of similar personalities like y'all could've been quadruplets in another life. So fun to be following both sets of twins since they were in high school to now mature ladies with their significant other.
This video was great it was so nice hearing all of yours guys pov but having similar values. And I just felt like I was with a group of friends talking. I recently got engaged so it was a good time to see this video!
I started watching you guys around the same time y'all met! (7ish years)💕 I think we are close by in age and seeing you in this journey and being a couple of steps behind has me so excited for what comes next for y'all and me🥰🥰🥰
Also this collab though can't wait for all 3🥺❤️
Yayzzz been waiting for this vid😭🥺❤️
YAYYY!!! Been waiting for this one!! Love all of y’all sm!!💗❤️
I love this style of vid- just "sit and talk". I feel like we don't get enough of that nowadays with so many challenges and trends. You don't really get to experience the people behind the videos much.
Hearing how you guys talk about marriage just for sure assures me that I married the wrong man wrong reasons. Definitely don’t marry just anyone and don’t settle! 😅
Bless you all four❤️✨
Yesss part 2 when Nessas married
I legit cried when the three of you bought your wedding dresses the smile you put on Nessa's face.  This is called friendship ❤❤❤.I love you guys so muchhhhh
this was SOOOO adorable!!!!
It touched me when Vanessa answered the question the moment she knew John was the one.
I would love a part two
As someone who’s been watching since i was 14 & now I’m 21 this just makes me so happy & gives me so much hope , I love this
Part two!!! I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while and am not ready to get married just yet but I can’t see myself with anyone else. So I love these wedding related videos y’all have been uploading.
I loved watching this video and I'm not even close to be in a relationship let alone get married. But this gave me hope. Maybe one day I'll find the one.
Everyone should swap husbands/fiance's for the day!!
its so great seeing nessa with the man of her dreams finally after a long time of being the "single twin" she found the perfect guy for her
I absolutely loved this
My son is proposing to his girlfriend on New Year’s Eve, he has my grandma’s engagement ring 🥰 I’m so excited 💜
I looove the video and love you all! 🥺❤️ We definitely need more 😁
I'm like Asa in the leaving cabinets and stuff open. I don't know why but I'm really bad at leaving everything open
I really enjoyed this collaboration! Also, enjoy the video of you on their channel. Please keep the collaborations coming.
Love you Brooklyn and bailey
this vid is so good love yall sooo much
What a lovely video!❤️
i agree up watching them and now they’re married!!! i’m so happy💗
I absolutely love you guys!!! We need part 2, but we also need the boys to get together and do something similar to this!!!🤍
You guys are literally glowing!!
Staying around for part 2!
You guys should do a podcast together
Cute how they are wearing the colors of each house I'm Hogwarts 🙂
you guys are really milking these engagement/wedding videos
i loved this video!
The way this is edited I cannot see the rings, there was no decent close up.
i love how each set of twins wore similar outfits :)
I loved this video so much. This was so sweet
I'm like cheering with them when they were looking at their wedding dresses🤣🤣
Love how you guys are so sweet towards one another 🥹❤️ Oh my gosh Imagine if you guys started a podcast together 😭😭 I would for sure tune in to every episode!
It would be so much fun if you guys made a wedding q&a guy ver!!
So true I like never got hit on before I got married. Now I get hit on its so weird
Why do I feel like Ronnie is 🤰🏻
Guys please don't make your channel all about wedding now. I understand it is a big change in your lives and we are very happy for you, but now it's repetitive and starting to get boring. Save this topic for later and bring some fun ideas in between. I am your OG subscriber and a part of your family from the beginning (CGH), I thought I should recommend something.
It felt like Bailey wanted to be the center of attention the whole time…
Loved this so much.
Part 2 part 2 part 2 📢📢
I LOVE these wedding talks. It gets me excited about finding someone and spending my life with them💕💕  Love u guys cant wait for the next one <3
I love how Nessa sat there taking it all in and learning from the others while still sharing her feelings. Watching this video makes me want to get married even more. I'm only a teenager, so I know I'm probably just a kid to you guys, but that is what I dream of having one day; a relationship where I won't be hurt, with someone who loves me for me, and with friends and family by my side. I'm sooo excited for Nessa's wedding! Love you guys!! ❤️❤️❤️
PART 2! PART 2! PART 2!
I LOVED this video!! It was so heartwarming ☺️☺️
Part 2 PLEASEE!!!!
I love this so much ❤
I could listen to you all talk all day! Podcast!?!
I know this Brooklyn and Bailey (Merrell twins) channel but you should do a video where the 4 guys sit down and answer wedding/engagement questions to get there point of view
20:08 I DO THIS TOO😭! I feel a little less weird now
*Vanessa realizing she has OCD*
Omg I love this, I can’t wait to be married too!! Lol I’m 16
Yes Part 2 please after she’s married!!
Something I find so beautiful about these women is that they are all in it for the marriage aspect. The weddings sure were beautiful and I know that Nessa's definitely will be. But how they talk about the marriage part just makes me feel butterflies! I've been married for just over a year (got married at 23) and it's been amazing! 🥰
I love watching merrel twins they are the best! I love when you make videos with each other
I love thissss!
YES please do a part 2 <3 I LOVE this video <3
The best Christmas present, thank you very much.
I just noticed they’re all wearing hogwarts house colours haha!! Red, green, blue & yellow :D
I loved this video so much! I've been following you guys since the literal beginning and it's so wholesome to see everyone growing up
This is one of my favorite videos you guys have ever made!! So precious 🥲
I loved this video so much!!! Also brooklyn and bailey are really close to 7MILLION!!
I bet John and Nessa’s Wedding is not until 2024
I Just hope Vanessa is Happy.. That is all.
Marriage is the best. It has been these few years and with a baby too. I feel bad for the people who say “just wait/the romance will die.” It doesn’t have to. Yes, relationships change, but so do you. It can be for the better!!
We need a part 2 when nessa is married
I remember watching both of you guys when I was younger and now we’re all grown up and getting married 😢
It’s such a full circle, I have grown up together and now ur married. God bless you 4
“i dont go out, im scared of people” LITERALLY VANESSA IS TOO RELATABLE
I love how all of you guys are wearing different colors tbh they look super cute together. Love all you guys!
Accent braids
I also love the fact that Nessa and Roni's guys have similarities with their Dad, Paul. John loves playing guitars like Paul do. Aaron loves vlogging and camera stuffs like Paul do. AND IT'S THE CUTEST! 😍❤🥺
this is the 2nd best video at all and the 1st obviously it’s part two when nessa gets married 😂🤍 love you all
I LOVEEEEE THISSSSSSS🥰❤
Slayyyy slayyyy
Almost to 7 mil!! Loved the video and would love a pt. 2 in the future!
Hi i just wanted to say yall are so pretty omg  i wish i could meet yall in real life by the way i love your videos love ya guys hope yall see this :)
hi brooklyn and bailey i loved this video and all of you guys look so pretty 💕💕
God Bless
How come they didn’t go to each others weddings
i’m with asa i totally leave cabinet doors and drawers open all the time on accident without even realizing it😅😅
I love it when you collab. ❤️ I hope to see all 6 of you. Brooklyn & Bailey, Merrel Twins & Rybka Twins 😍
Thoroughly enjoyed this. Just wholesome content. Definitely need a part 2! ❤
Yes to part two!!!❤
Y’all should one video with all the guys talking about marriage that’s will be fun
am i the only one waiting for a first-time video for Brooklyn?!!!! or just like a honeymoon video!
I've been waiting for this! Thanks for answering my question! ☺❤
LOL this went from gushing about weddings and SOs to that episode of Friends where the girls played dress up with the wedding gowns 😂
I'm SO HAPPY FOR BROOKLYN I can't even express it! <3
Love this so much xx
Yesszzz! We need to see a part 2!.
I’m literally so excited for my engagement that is coming really soon. I’m already looking at wedding colors and took inspiration from the green Brooklyn used in her wedding colors but I’m also leaning towards the green and purple roni used. I told my boyfriend that the next time we’re at work because we work at Home Depot that we need to look at paint colors for wedding inspo.
Definitely! Give us part 2!
yass independent women!
I want part 2❤😂❤❤❤
love you guys soooooo stinkin' much! 3:41 was SUCH a twin moment!
This is such a cute video🥺❤️ love you guys
Im not married (yet. Not engaged either). But now that you guys are married (or getting married) you can start your own personal traditions with holidays but base it off old family traditions if that makes sense
I hope you can make more collabs in the future girls. The video was great, I just wished there wasn't background music.
This was such a fun video!!
My sister is getting engaged on Saturday and I’m soooo excited for her!!!
Nessa always has such great wisdom to share! ❤
Love this collab!! And so happy you guys are close to 7 million 🎉
Great to hear you talk about your weddings and married/engaged life. Also great segment at the end showing your wedding dresses. Loved the video 😊
Loved loved loved this video!! Part 2 def needs to happen ❤❤
I  can relate too brooklyn saying everything became so easy. My boyfriend and I are two and a half months into dating, we both had several relationsships before and for both of us, it is completly different this time. After like a month or so we acted like we have known each other for years, even though its has only been half a year since he asked me, at a wedding I worked at, to get to know me. And I'm so happy I gave him my instagram after I first rejected him... But, honestly, I think we've been dating for like two weeks, when he told me he wanted to get married before he turns 30 (he turns 25 in April, I turn 20 in January) what really had me speechless for a second, because before i've never been sure I actually want to get married. But with him that thought isn't scary anymore, not at all. We'll see what the future holds...
Great video! I could help but watch the video with a smile 😊
This was so good! Please do it more often!!!
Love that we can be so real with each other! Friendships like this are hard to find!🥹💜💖
That’s something who just got engaged at the age of 18 while I just turned 19 and half too better but yeah, got engaged on Valentine’s Day and was together with my my fiancé for a year from 17 to 18 then 18 219 that is expense but I think your anniversary is in January and we haven’t met in person yet and really can’t do anything to talk to her because I don’t have my own room But it’s like I’m always in. I don’t really know how to explain it but I really like this videos because it’s like me being non-binary and my fiancé not knowing her gender fully it’s like I don’t know how to start planning my wedding because it’s like I always said I want to wear a dress but since I figure out my gender I want a suit but I’ve never worn one but it’s like I also want something to represent like grandpa and me and emailing the colors of the stuff for my side of the wedding like you having more than one maid of honor and me having guys on my side it’s like yeah I Wedding’s gonna be different because it’s not between two females it’s between a nonbinary and their partner who doesn’t know their gender but it’s like I really like watching these videos but also because of mine and my fiancé said to go up people have said a lot of stuff about us because I’m 19 and she’s 25 so we have a six year age difference. She’s a 90s baby while I’m at 2000s baby.
The fact that I started to watch both of them when I was 9/10 and all are either married or engaged
seeing you guys together makes me so happy🥹🫶🏻
Love this, it is so cute ❤️
PLEASE DO MORE VIDS LIKE THIS
part two plzzz
I am sooooo happy for you all!! I love each and everyone of you guys with ALL of my heart! I´ve been watching you all since 2016, and have loved every second of it. You guys make me so happy, you have no idea. I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCH!!! ❤❤
Loved it! Great stuff to hear
I love this video so much!! Can’t wait for part 2. I would love for you guys to try on your wedding dress in the future. I have been married for 6years and no longer fit into mine 😢
Do this video again in 5 years when you all have kids and see if your answers are still similar.
Y’all are so cute all together and these are my fav collabs!🥰
This was adorable! Definitely need a PART 2 once Vanessa & John are hitched too! 😄💍👰🤵💘
I recently got engaged
yall… maybe i’m just emotional from my period but this video touched a special place in my heart. i’ve watched them since the photo they put up of when they met each other and i just can’t help but feeling like i’ve grown with them. i was just a lil thing watching these teenage role models and now here i am watching all of them who are now married/engaged and have wonderful lives with their amazing spouses. i’m so genuinely beyond happy for each and every one of you. y’all are like the big sisters i never had and i’m so happy y’all are happy. much love 💜💚🤍
The day my sister got married I went to a bagel shop to grab breakfast and coffee. Well, they didn't have creamer to go for all the bridesmaids and my sister. I literally broke down crying in the middle of the shop saying "my sister is getting married today she only likes cream in her coffee and now I can't even do that" well they gave me a half gallon of creamer to get me out of the store lol
i felt emotional! i have been seeing them forever and nw they are married!!! ahhh its crazy and sweet
i love how all the stories of “how you knew he was the one” are so unique and wholesome. so genuinely happy for all of you guys💗💗 this was SUCH a good video idea!! love you all🫶🏻🫶🏻
It's so wholesome, how everyone is wearing their rings... 😍😍😍
My boyfriend and I’ve been dating for almost 8 months and I know we are the ones for each other. And I hate how people around us always tell us that we feel that way because we are in a “phase” they always say how our relationship is going to change and I feel more in love every day so I know our relationship is not going to change to bad. I love seeing you guys talking about your partners and how easy it is to be with them. I feel that I found my persona and I’m super happy with him 🥰😭
Yaya wow I love it your video is so amazing and awesome Brooklyn and Bailey Vanessa and Veronica so amazing 👏 ❤️ 👍🥰💯
Thank you so much for your words at the end. It gave me some peace and hope hearing you talk about marriage in such a positive way. Marriage is always something I've wanted, but Vanessa was totally right when she said social media tends to tell women they shouldn't want that. Y'all are such beautiful examples of the joys of marriage and how it can better your life, rather than hindering it like most people suggest. Thank you❤ I hope I can experience this for myself someday.
This video made me soooo happy ❤️💙🧡💚
The end was so cute 🥰   Hot tip: y’all should get your dresses cleaned and preserved ASAP, I put my dress away after my wedding and looked at it a year later and it was completely ruined… 😭😭
This video was so fun, we love to see twins with twins collab!😍 Definitely down for a part 2 with a future married Nessa of course😉💍. I think this just reassured me a little more that getting married isn't as bad and that I will 100% cry when I find my person for sure😅😂 I'm feeling hopeful about love🥰, lysm!❤
love it!!
Would LOVE an updated version when  Vanessa gets married 🤍💛🤍😊
Ladies y’all are so blessed. God has given you something more beautiful than life. I’m so proud of all of y’all beautiful ladies ❤ :)
I literally grew up watching you guys, and just listening to you all find your special someone made me so emotional.
when nessa gets married yall should do a video of all ur husbands.... not sure what kind but something to work with
are the merrell twins Christan ?
I’ve watched both of you guys for so long and everyone is married. It’s crazy that my husband and I have been together for almost 5 years and I’m 22 turning 23 while being married for 5 months. Life is too short so being married young should not be frowned upon! I wish nothing but the best for all of you! Advice would just be keep the dates going! Never stop “dating” your significant other!
I also put brown sugar in my spaghetti!!!
Congratulations 🍾🎊🎉 to y’all !!!
I loved this video it’s so wholesomene and cute can you do a part 2
Me: *Single teenager without a single prospect of marriage* Also me: *absolutely absorbed in this video*
My heart! Loved this 💕 I've been married to my high school sweetheart for 3 years now and have a 2 year old and it's seriously the best being married to your best friend
Great video. I just wish you would have shown close ups of each ring 💍
Brooklyn&Bailey I really like that you guys did YouTube video with the Merrell twins  Engagement wedding QN And I really like watching your YouTube videos on YouTube channel
Been with my boyfriend for 10 years now. 5 years since we moved in together and a wee one on the way. Maybe will get married at some point but it’s nice the way life is going. Maybe 5 years and I’ll be married.
You guys are so beautiful!!!❤️❤️❤️😻
I love watching the four of you! You guys are the best twins ever!
We appreciate them for sharing great insights. Seems not all sets of twins share the exact same opinions on certain matters. We all hope to see them succeed further in their careers.
Loving all the collabs but also hoping they made one big video with all 3 sets of twins
I love this vid so so so much this duo is absolutely amazing!! thx for these entertaining vids 😂!! love from london ❤❤
You should do a secret Santa type thing with the husbands/fiancé so put all there names in a hat and blind draw the girls have to buy the name they drew an outfit and see how accurate they got it
Loved this video SO MUCH!
Hey Brooklyn and Bailey! You should do a collab with the Merrell Twins
this video was so good, it's nice hearing different views or opinions from 4 healthy beautiful god-filled relationships! You should collab more!
⍑ℎⅈ↯ ⍵⍺↯ ↯ℴ ℃⌰⍑ⅇ
im so happy this video was so long. i didn't want it to end
To every girl watching this, remember you can still have your dream marriage/wedding in your 30s. Do not rush into a marriage, take your time it will be just as amazing!🎉
Baileys hairstyle (curls) make her hair look flat on top and then wide, then flat again on camera. I’m sure in person it looks great but in this media it doesn’t look as good.
I’m so happy that y’all are in the same stages!! Congrats to you all!!!❤🎉
I love all of you guys such gorgeous people and kind hearts 💕💕 wish y’all the best of luck 🫶🏼
Love the red, green, blue, yellow cardigans ❤️💚💙💛
Yes!! This is the legit best collab <3
Can't wait for Nessa's 💍❤️❤️❤️
Brooklyn and Bailey Yall should do a photoshoot in yalls wedding dresses it would be soo cute!!!!!!!!!!
The wedding & engagement Q&A ft. Merrell Twins looks absolutely awesome! 👍 😄
Awesome video I really like it lot it was cool and you made awesome video and you are my favorite's YouTuber and you are best YouTuber
I'm definitely more like Nessa with prepping and planning  what you will do later. Thoughts, routines and everything. I couldn't stop laughing when she mentioned reading a lot of books because I do the same too!
Bailey didn’t really cry
Nessa at 26:55 is me when people tell me to smile in group photos lol
yes part 2!
Ahh 🫶🏻🫶🏻
Love them so  much❤️❣️
This was the best video y’all could’ve done
Ahh so excited for all the videos!!!
Love this video!!! We need Aaron, John, Dakota, and Asa make a video with you four. It’s crazy how different aesthetics of the dress styles! I would say Roni and Brooklyns wedding was super alike with the hairstyles. Are y’all going to Vanessa and Johns wedding? Y’all need to do an updated vision of this wedding after Vanessa’s wedding with the men!! Are y’all going to vlog y’all’s pov for Christmas this year??
Audio sounds off
Congratulations to all you girls, life changed quite a bit when I got married. I had to first share my life with someone, think how I behave and take care of the woman I lived with. Then my friends said that I had changed in a positive way
My fave twins
both of my favorite twins on youtube! i grew up watching both of your channels 💌🥺
19:54 I’m a cabinet leave opener…
A lot of good tea so far! Very excited for Nessa's wedding! We got a few hints for it during yesterday's members stream! 👀 Congrats on 7 million subscribers in advance! 😊
Love y’all!❤
Purple is the color of royalty
yk, I've never heard or thought about the flirting with the taken guy as being bf material, as a reason to flirt with him
I'm so glad for this video today. I needed something to do to calm me down and watching you guys always does that. It's been a long day lol, annoying people and being overstimulated pretty much all day. To the point where I was almost crying in class for no reason. On top of that it's that time of the month so it all just came together. Not fun. But I can't wait to watch the whole video. I l0ve you guys so much and your so inspirational! Thank you for everything you guys don't know how much you help❤️❤️
we love you! we met you in 2018 and it was so special!
Is it just me or is anyone else wanting a update on their houses!!!❤❤❤
