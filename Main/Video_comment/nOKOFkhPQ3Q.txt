I love these dogs, they really helps us get through COVID lockdown. Thanks Andrew.
I just can't get enough of this guy and his wit with these wonderful,  cute pups!!
Their job is to make sure you do your job which is taking care of them and making videos for us. 😂😂
They DID write 2 books.  That couldn't have been easy with no opposable thumbs.
These videos crack me up! Love it!!! Please don't stop posting these!
Love the shots from the go pro while they are swimming.
Mabel looks fast!
Looks like they've had another busy day. ❤
I am getting SO nervous. I've been catching up on the playlist, and as of right now, I have ONLY *ONE* year left, before I'll be like everyone else, just WAITING on the next video of Olive and Mabel...
Mabel does a great job at finding sticks. Olive oversees her.
I can say I watched Olive and Mable videos every day, being perfect companions. I will need to in 2025 and for the unseen future.  TY
They DEFINITELY deserve a pay raise 😂😂😂 They do a Fantastic job distracting and providing much comfort in this troubled world.  Gold star ⭐️ and a biscuit 🥮
They, through you, provide All of us joy and love! 🥰
Love you. Parfect 🫶🐾🐾🦋
one is going to do #2 behind you and you're gonna stand in it... murphy's law of dogs...
They proect you, and Mam, and your home 24/7 Dad!
I love most dogs, but there's something uniquely wonderful about Labradors.
They make me (and millions others) happy.  And trust me, that is a HEAVY LIFT, my friend. Even with their two associates, who already live here with me. Its a HUGE job! But they are all amazing at it. Give em some slack and a treat. Thanks so much!
I think they prefer to  function in a  supervisory capacity.  And aren't  they great.
The level of pure joy and happiness these two beauties give to people is immeasurable.
Andrew, I absolutely love the three of you!
They protect your house from tennis balls and squirrels... Come on man!
The original influencers
You are in a league of your own! ,,, the close camera on maple - she looks like a Muppet! Hilarious,, totally,, I will get them a pawer to protect their employment issues. Just saying.
Dogs are not created to work, unless that is their form of enjoyment.  I am sure that some breeds do love working, but not Olive and Mabel.
The way Olive and Mabel look at you is ❤❤❤❤❤
Truly enjoyed listening to your book and the lovely moments you shared. Yes two dogs are better than one as I’ve found out. Enjoyed your videos. As a Scot living in Western Australia originally from Aberdeen who hasn’t been back for twenty years ( because of family commitments) it was breathtaking watching your winter trek in the Mamores. Thank you and give Olive and Mabel an extra scratch behind their ears from me. ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇦🇺😎
They work hard as therapists and full time influencers….
It’s hard work to be so cute! 😂
what do they do?  nothing and everything     a joy to watch   love those 2
G'day from New South Wales Australia. What can bring more joy than a pair of dogs keeping their person in order.
Supervising!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤Love looking at their expressions. Good work!
What do we do? Keep you company and star in these videos of yours.
They make us all happy! And they are great at their job
SHENANIGANS!! Hooray!
Dogs :  when they look at you with their loving and trusting eyes.  Such faithful companions.
Live this trio
Love Mabel and Olive and it is so fun seeing them play and run so fast.  They love it.
❤️ I sure miss my Lucy,she’d always calm me with those eyes.
I just watched this again and found myself sort of smiling, relaxing, breathing out a sigh. Better than a meditation app.
They make us smile. They contribute to some subscribers. They are millionairs and you, dear Andrew, work for them. All year round. Food. Vets. Toys. Comfy beds. Occupational therapy. Last not least LOVE. Even when they let "all the unpleasentness soak in" and stand in dirty waters...Just for fun. You and they saved lives during confinement. Quite a job.
Never a truer word spoken: chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world. Olive and Mabel can wave a wand (or their tails) and the day becomes brighter, a heavy load lighter. Hurrah for all the Olives and Mabels in this world, and lucky us, who have our homegrown version of those two sweet girls ❤
They are wonderful!!
It ain't work if you enjoy it
I applaud your innate and unsurpassable commentating skills ! (and editing) You could commentate on a 'frogs life' and it would still be the most emotional moment of our day !
Lovely mate❤❤
They're job is to be a Labrador. Play, go in as much water & cuddle their owners. Wonderful
😂😂😂😂their job(with your translation) is to make us smile. Job well done!💕💕
Perimeter security check😂I love these babies, Andrew!  Thank you for these little visits!❤
Global assistance dogs that help us get through our day ❤😂
Olive and Mabel love you - that’s their most important job! 3:46
"Trying to help in a deeply misguided way". Same Mabel . Same
No human can give the comfort and love a dog does- still grieving for my boys, these girls lift my heart! 🐶
I haven't seen your videos for months and the other day I heard your voice in my head and it reminded me to go to your channel 😄
I love it when they run on the beach!
Love your videos. We have Goldens. Like labs, just lazier.
A pay raise is in order.  Olive and Mable are (seriously) providing much needed emotional support to the entire internet community
They are comforting me- for sure!
Seeing Mabel w a bit of grey is ❤- love these girl !!
Dude sounds just like my roommate in college. Same humor, same wonderful accent, and just as sharp!
Reading this in mid-February 2024 and remembering “The dogs that broke the internet”, when you, Mr Cotter, uploaded your first clip of Olive and Mabel having breakfast on the patio. The COVID-19 lockdown had confined us 🇬🇧 to our homes and the world was panicking. But the sight of these two adorable, daft dogs and the sound of that voice and that accent went round the world like Superman and reached millions and millions of people. You did that.🥰 Olive and Mabel did that.🥰 We haven’t forgotten 🥰😮 Thank you so much 🙏
Good working dogs at Youtube!
Just started watching these.  Am hooked!  Love Olive and Mabel! ❤😊
Every job needs a gaffer!
They ARE a chief distraction in a very troubled world.  They always make me smile, and give a lift to my heart.  Thank you for sharing them.
That’s just shenanigans.😂😂😂
The commentary is just spot on. These dogs are loved by so many people who have never met them. ❤
Working like a dog and will not stop until it's done.
Absolutely the best video I have ever seen
Sweetly daft in the best possible way, perfect....Thank you so much, a real tonic.
I need a chief provider of comfort and shenanigans!
Iv sent this to all my friends who have labradorite and or dogs they love ❤️ they are assistance dogs in the best possible way love it
They are living their best life and your voice and comentry is both soothing and hilarious 😂❤
Ye i would say this is an average day in the life for a dog, my cockapoo is the same, however will not under any circumstances play with another dog 😂
Mabel is such a ditzy sweetheart
I have been listening to Olive, Mabel & Me for the 20th+ time today. Then discovered this video. Shenanigans add so much to life. Thank you, Mr. Cotter, Ms. Caroline & Olive and Mabel. The perfect video to watch before retiring for the evening❤
A Business trip we went to the beach 😂😂😂 brilliant. Absolutley love Olive and Mabel ❤❤
It's good to see Olive and Mabel again :). Keep it up please 🙏
I’m thinking Dolly Parton would be happy to contribute. Happy New Year girls, and Andrew 💜💕💜💕
Chief distraction in a troubled world. If only someone could pay me for that, I'd be rich. LOL
An angry Dolly Parton!!!LOL
The speed of his comments, like the squirrel landing craft, is often lost. Worth listening over and over again and with diligence.
I love you three
Conducting a secure perimeter check COULD be, and probably is, quite a responsibility. Have you read their reports. They’re quite detailed.
The thing is I am one of those people who takes on older dogs (Charlie was 7 years old) the one before him George was 8 years..well someone has to do it aye
Just lost my 12 year old nearly 13 yrs old Lab Charlie a week ago.  A stroke apparently.  Oh Andrew I am devastated it hurts so much.  thanks for the videos
Andrew, please really relish and appreciate the time you have with these wonderful dogs as it goes only too quickly
Was there life before Olive and Mabel......
My two dogs, have, in their opinion, two of the hardest job in the world as they have to supervise me while I work from home while snoozing on the chesterfield in my home office, while still looking super cute. 😂  They think Olive and Mable do a wonderful job sharing joy and happiness throughout the world.
08.34.  I would like to point out that Mabel and Olive did take you for a walk twice, would you have done 2 walks if you didn't have them?  They also entertained you with stick fetching.  They are also supervising your work like raking leaves, which needs improvement 😊
Happy Birthday to MABEL! 7 years old but you don't act a year over 3. Hope Food Source gave you a lovely new stick and let you keep it this time.
Olive and Mabel. Emotional support dogs for the entire world. ❤❤❤ Please give them a few extra treats for me. And some tummy rubs.
❤
Merry Christmas, Olive and Mabel! My dog says you may wish to notify your human that jumping up on the sofa is work according to the rules of physics. (At least she thinks it is, and she's frequently right about this sort of thing.)
Checking for "squirrels' amphibious landing craft".  Right that's it, I've had too much to drink, going to bed.  Hic.
Like how the outbound and incoming cadence are different.
Being adorable. Crucial job done.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY OLIVE! Hope you had a great one. Eleven years young. Did Food Source make you a steak? Did you get a new tennis ball?
They are very good at their job. Good girls. 😊
Judging by the comments (an I agree) you don't need to do anything special for us appreciators - just take us on one of your walks.  We would love it as much as the pups do.
Thank you thank you thank you
Great fan.. you three make me smile.Chris
"Squirrels amphibious landing craft" 😂
Love it, the go-pro shots are fab, I must get one for my lab
I am here after a comment on a Venus/Serena Williams video from 2016 Wimbledon.  Now I know why.  Fantastic.
I often ask my two pups what it is they do for work, they tend just to look at me, think for a second stretch and go back to sleep 😂 they do however assist me in the garden by digging little holes or lying on the collected leaves…wouldn’t be without them. Lovely video, thanks for sharing such joy.
Honestly I wasn’t maple have to be the best dogs in the world.
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂
Giving comfort and distraction in a troubled world - worth it's weight in gold.
thank you for the too cute and sweet clips,  Mr. Cotter.  Seen a Mark Anthony note on here, and reminded me of the Rome series where before he dies and starts reflecting on all that he had (and lost),  sums it up by saying something like having had Life is all that really mattered.  My dog's world is where he takes me to escape when we're out walking a field.  Grounded by the ground.  Love your videos and your dogs.  Thanks again!!
Littlest hobo for the win 😂🇨🇦
Best antidote to the news
Those flapping ear/running shots fill my soul
Beautiful as always.
Love the dog cams!
Thanks for the "comfort and distraction" in my troubled world.  Good Dogs!!!
The same conversation I have with my crew
Their favorite job is couch-warmer.
Thank you Olive and Mabel and Andrew for a view into your world. Our animals bring us so much joy and peace.
I vote pay rise NOW!!! ❤🎉❤
shenanigans ARE work, sir.
Thanks for a great video as always, and your closing remark was right on the money. Hugely appreciated.
I just love your videos. You are so clever and your dogs are so beautiful. I feel like I know Olive and Mabel. Thank you for sharing your talent with us. If I lived in Scotland, I would look you up and come and say hello.
Mabel with that twig in her mouth  😂
Their job is to play, and I think they did a great job.
❤❤❤
"Perimeter security check": Now there's a legitimate job description! I just knew Olive and Mabel had legitimate jobs - they don't need to justify their cushy lives.
Ah, these two! 💛🖤 Never met them but I love them!  Thanks for sharing them with us.
Love to Olive and Mabel...... Putting a smile on my face since the pandemic.  😊😊😊😊
Their jobs are: Branch Manager, obviously.
Love the doggie cam footage with the floppy ears. How do you keep the background stable while they run around?
Those floppy ears flopping at the beach :)
What awesome memories you have recorded & can keep forever of your beautiful dogs! Thanks so much for sharing them, they are so special!❤❤
I have missed Mabel and Olive! Thanks for the new video.
Their joie de vivre is level 10.  These puppers are awesome!
Mabel is very proud of that stick
Truer words have never been spoken. Olive and Mabel are emotional support for you and through these videos, for so many of us. Thank you Andrew, Mabel, and Olive.  May there be more beach days in your future.  :)
Those two sure love to run !
Just so fantastic. Your voice, these doggies and such dreamy scenery. You live in paradise.
😂
I’m just recovering from a violent and explosive fit of laughter at the “…squirrels in amphibious landing craft” remark. I love this channel. It gives me joy in a world sometimes lacking in it.
Entertainers in chief, that's what 😍
Beautiful angels XxX
Watching channel 4 news?
Oh, the love and adoration in their eyes as the look at you is so sweet and special!
My dogs do sleep a lot, but technically, they are on guard duty 24/7. I love your Pup with her tiny stick. Too hilarious! 😂
You have a great support crew there. ❤
Leaves from a red oak!
Please don't ever stop doing these videos ❤
"But really, that's just shenanigans."  😆
They’re international celebrities
❤️❤️
My landlord won't let me have a 'provider of distraction and comfort', so thank you for sharing yours. ❤
They may not work 9 to 5, but they give pure joy 24/7.  xx
Canine caviar! It's everywhere horses are! Best wishes from Harper, Rustoleum, and Churchill. And me, the human...
They love you. Biggest best job ❤❤
Love Olive and Mabel❤
They are supervisors and moral support!
Aw.  (Wiping away a tear.)
Lucky dogs. In Northern California there would be like 1000 people at that beach, yes the weather is about the same, but that doesnt stop them from coming and even swimming. Leash laws prevent my boys from properly frolicking even though there is always a random dog running around. Its a bummer. Dont take all that alone time with your best friends for granted.
Youfast becoming national treasures, ye know? Xx ❤😂
Happy Chocolate Family are lovely too. We need our doggie distractions and love.
Mr. Andrew... I can't thank you enough for the joy your videos of Olive and Mabel have brought to me.. in my darkest times, they never fail to bring me back to happiness.  Please never stop these videos
Thank you again sir.  Good to see the girls out and about!
Those ears. There is nothing so lovely and soft as a lab’s ears.
I love these dogs
Oh my goodness, I so look forward to Olive and Mabel!!  Their job is making people all over the world happy, and at that job they excel! Thank you for all the hard work YOU put into these videos and for sharing Mabel and Olive with us! Love you Mabel, Love you Olive!!😘😘
good stuff, job well done, keep it up!
Silky ears definitely deserve it .
Sending gratitude from Vancouver Canada. So lovely to be transported to the world where Mabel's tail never stops wagging and Olive is always up to some hijinks. We love you Andrew for continuing to share these mundane yet good for the soul moments with us all. What a lovely man you are.
😍😍
They carry your camera! ❤❤
😂😢
I just love those two rascals! ❤
❤❤
She provides a stick to those who don’t realize they need them!!!
A business trip to the beach 😂
Always heartwarming!
I think they do the most important job, make the world look beautiful through their eyes, 2 lovely dogs, enjoying life,. Please keep these videos going Mr Cotter.
The role that these two perform are essential! I love these two so much. Thank you for providing a glimpse into their wonderful life. ❤
I have been wondering how you all have been! Thanks for posting!! ❤
Love to this wonderful family ❤️❤️❤️
A bit rich talking about Olive and Mabel not doing real work, considering you’re a sports commentator…🤨😆
But they go a fetch the ball for you. Here it is Dad. I am in charge of the chucker but everytime my Cavalier, Smartie, takes it back to his Dad. I have tried to head him off but he just veers round me. 🤣. Look Dad I have it for you.
Fallen leaves are good for lawns, don't take them just leave 'em
Love these dogs! I need to ask what cameras do you use when the are running?
They look beautiful and make peoples hearts smile 😊❤️😊💜😊
What a beautiful message at the end.
H.E.L.P.I.N.G!!
I love yr videos  with yr partners in crime 😅😊.so funny watching them with the cameras on their backs .and that's a lovely part of the world  u live in xx
We need all the distraction and comfort we can get.  Give those dogs more treats!!!
❤
Perfect anodyne for living in this world.
Are squirrels an amphibious landing craft? 😂😂😂
I’m really really not crying
A bit of a backward step.  🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️
They love unconditionally
For some reason the thumbnail is horrifying
I haven’t laughed this much in a while, ya had me crying, I Thank You!! 🤣
I think Dolly Parton would love Olive and Mable
Beautiful babies. Just being in the same air space as them is sooo good for the soul
Well done!
I've just given my chief distraction and comfort a payrise too. She says thank you Andrew.
You think you’re providing a vital service but that’s just . . . shenanigans
I find it quite shocking that you needed their vital importance pointed out to you. Are you trying to look for a reason to deny a request for a financial raise ?  You lout.
Olive and Mabel give and share great love and receive great love because of this.  That is a very important job so many have a hard time doing.   🙏 Mr. Cotter
Love the flapping ears😂
Their job is to make you happy.
I love the way they eagerly wait for instruction from Andrew as he continues to blab about them not doing anything. 😄
Thank you for continuing to do these videos!!
Loved this!  Just being is everything. Thank you, Andrew, Olive, and Mabel!
Totally hilarious, oh my god, I love Olive and Mabel SO MUCH!! (along with millions of others...) Can never get enough of them.
"sleepin' on the job again!?!"
😊❤
Oh, my heart! I miss my girl so much, and these two make me smile. You have so many remote (no people around) places to go with them! How wonderful. Thank you for sharing them.
“We’ll try harder tomorrow dad, after breakfast “ 😅
Ruff, ruff!! Yeah! Our favorites are back!
Oh i hate when Dolly gets on the phone!  Unfortunately, i have lost my 2 dogs within the past 2 months. One from cancer and the other from a brain tumour.   I really feel kind of numb at the moment, as if this is like one of those magazine stories I've read, and think "that must be horrible", but no, its happening to me.   As an alcoholic in recovery i feel like quitting recovery every day, i just want to go back to a time when i was happy over something.   Anyway, i am doing what i can to connect with others, ive got a good support group around me, but, i still go to bed every night and i spoon the whole quilt which i know one of my two would have definitely hated and id have woken up to a cold nose on my back, or nudges lol.
Dogs would, if they had hands.
I just sent this video to my 47 yr. old son who I haven't spoken to for 2 yrs.  Universal beginning solvent for irreconcilable souls
Another genius video. We all need these kinds of workers in our lives ❤
So loved seeing the girls again. Made my morning. Thank you
Every night when I face time with my Son,my furry Granddaughter (his cat) is zonked out on her throne. I ask the same question and he tells me its all the hard labor she did that day.  Yesterday she dug holes to put poles in for the new fencing, painted them too,herded the chickens (he doesn't have any) and milked the cows(ditto)! Then he snuggles with her and strokes her beautiful lush fur. All that hard work pays off! Thanks Olive and Mabel for being such good role models! ❤❤❤
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
The best doggy-cam shots I've seen - great fun.
❤️❤️
Good point made in a wonderful way. Thank you.
Bravo, job well done.
Olive and Mabel, thank you. Always makes my day!
Isnt this dog abuse making them work so hard😂
Feeling a weird bond, since I have to rake the same kind of oak tree leaves.
Brilliant 💙uk
❤❤❤😊
No day is a bad day with Olive and Mabel and your dulcet tones, Mr. Cotter! This was just what I needed this morning, thank you for the sweetness and humour you bring with each  installment. 😂
OMG, how delightful to see Olive, Mabel and you(well, sort of) again! Like a drop of water in the desert. Thank you!
Love the work update.
The new(?) camera angles are remarkably stable! 🤩🤩🙌🙌😍😍😊😊
Dogs - god love them,  definitely the Chief providers of distraction and comfort in todays troubled world.’
I love all the Olive and Mabel stories and 100% agree they are the Chief distractors for these troubled times !❤ keep up the good work !!
Why does the dog-mounted camera not bounce around with the dog bounding and swimming ?? 🤔😮
Nice leaves. Red Oak?
Distraction and comfort have been achieved! ✔️ Time for a bonus 💰
Thank you Andrew, hope all is well with you and yours.  Cheers
That was a backward step 😂😂❤ Additional ear benefits. Hehehe. 🎉
Thank you Thank You Thank you. Joy fun bliss and absolute tonic are you thee. Definate pay rise and can i push for some extra special treats for you all, your favourite of favourites of all things to do and eat drink and be merry. I send my unending gratitude and love to you all. 🐕🐕🍂🍁🍂🍁🧔
Love this <3
I'll bet if they asked, Dolly Parton would let them use the song. Olive and Mabel are adorable 🥰🐺❤️🍑
A bit of a backward step. 😂
1:39 Crucial shenanigans and snack management.  🥰
🎉❤🎉
the hardest working duo i've ever seen ❤
😍 lol awww
Mr. Cotter might not approve but the “chief provider...”comment would make a great T-shirt or sweatshirt/hoodie. ❤
You’re right. It’s so necessary just now. Thanks for the pick me up!
Looks like Formby beach, probably bump into you with our lab and flat coat. 😊
3:11 ... Says it better than I could.  It was a Olive and Mabel video that brought the first smile in weeks back in 2020.
Very important jobs right now, for sure.
That’s so good for the soul.  Lab love is the best therapy - I say this after had a pretty poor cold nights sleep as mine appeared to starfish the whole bed & devour any duvet from me.  😂
I click on your video as soon as I turn on the PC for the day.  Watching you and Olive and Mabel doing life is so relaxing.  Your voice is so soothing.  Thank you for starting my day with calm.  Luv from NC, USA
I see so much of my yellow lab Kala in Mabel.  Dogs are the best!  Thank you for sharing your girls with the world Mr. Cotter.
My husband died in May and a song came on the radio that had me floods of tears.  All three of you deserve  a pay rise.  Thank you.
Cheerful companion! That's a job! 🐶
Pay rise = more treats ❤
Absolutely a comfort, stopped reading the news and watched this instead and felt much better! Thank you 😊 😊
I believe dog', and lets remember that is God spelled backwards, who are loved and cared for work hardest  in providing unconditional love.
Just love your videos of Olive & Mable. 💜
They're Full Time Bringers of Joy! It's very serious business. Seriously cute, that is! 🙌😋🐕💞💫
😂😂❤
Keep up the hard work my 2nd favourite doggos!
Mabel's little smile as she holds that tiny stick in her mouth is so precious! 🥺
Love you Olive and Mabel!
*Squirrels' Amphibious Landing Craft* would make a great indie band name...                                    🐿🎸🐿🥁🐿🪇🐿🎷🐿🎤
It’s always a good day when there’s a new Olive and Mabel video! Thank you for sharing them with us ❤️
What do you mean “ wh  as t job do we do.. give you someone to love ❤️”
Betty, the magical unicorn schnauzer, performs the exact same work, though being two years old, and extremely diligent, she allows sounds the alarm should anyone or thing approaches the house, block, and quite possibly the county.
They're providers of love & affection, good girls doing a fantastic job they deserve a raise ❤
Olive and Mabel always make me smile. Thank you for your beautiful girls plus fabulous commentary❤️🐾❤️
Quite touching!
Top top dog dad!
The running flapping ears!!!  😂😂😂
The did some excellent camerawork as well.
Loppy lugs 😁
Squirrels in amphibious landing crafts - definitely a thing.
Shall I start a Petition for a payrise??
Bad day at work? I just come here.
Fun IS work, you monster!
In a weary and scary world, the gaze of pure love from Olive and Mabel into the camera is all we need  to get us through.  Thank you Andrew for sharing another short film of your humour and humanity via the shenanigans of the joy that is these marvellous furry beasts.
No matter how much assorted cat poop, dog poop & dead field mice (🥺) I still kiss my dogs on the lips. 🐾
I had a similar performance review with my 3. I questioned their lack of practical usefulness too. They criticised my training model and I had to concede to extra treats.
The soft ear pets for Dad are enough right there. 🥰🥰🥰
<3 the camera work. :)
Ass backwards, my friend.  We should be hearing their questions.
I've told river my beautiful and cheeky albeit ever so slightly naughty greyhound that he needs to up his work game and take a leaf out of olive and mables cvs 😂😂😂😂😂😂!!
Ask a silly question... And these two will show you the answer. Precious vid.
Here in Wisconsin, leaf raking is closely followed by snow shoveling. My dogs are as good at helping with these chores as Olive and Mabel, the emotional support they provide is priceless.
What a beautiful video. The support, love and joy they bring you is priceless.
Like most tv stars they are occasionally required to look beautiful!✨💫
Fabulous girls...
🐾🐾💕thank you Olive and Mabel for keeping your camera chap busy 😂xx
They are cameramen or cameradogs, in their case....
Its been a hard days night , and I've been not working like a dawg. Lol. Charming. I love the ears flapping in the wind. Lol.
Mabel’s flying ears!
So heart-warming to see these two beautiful girls again, we need to see more. Thankyou so much, the pure love they have for you is priceless...its what you've created Andrew x
If I were to be reincarnated I’d do worse than come back as a version of olive or Mabel
They totally rock the job of comfort givers!
Their work is keeping you busy xx
Thanks Olive and Mabel you also cheer us up on here too :-)
❤ 100% agreed, providing comfort and distraction in a very troubled world.   Thank you, Andrew, Olive and Mabel.  Aside: l thought Olive and Mabel go on business trips  whenever they go outside to do their business.
❤
Olive and Mable decided to make sure you get plenty of exercise and that you don't get bored. They don't want you getting up to mischief or wondering round aimlessly. It's hard work for them to keep you entertained, but they do it, and it appears they've trained you quite well. Well done girls! 😁
Who is a good doggie…Daddie! Signed Olive and Mabel.
Love these two 😂❤
You're a good dog owner!!!  : )   We have three of our own.
Mabel should have been red-carded for a high tackle at 1:24. Honestly, refereeing is so inconsistent these days.
Lost it at the beach, go girls! ❤
Olive and Mabel got us through Covid 1 & 2. They should receive awards galore for their keeping us from going bonkers
Olive is getting her salt&pepper face. ❤
"Wood chipper is not a job...."
Always wonderful to see their faces.❤
Those dogs have the best life - it's wonderful to see.
Did their pay rise involve sausages? I do hope so.
Oh, yeah, and it is so typically Labrador for them to sit in the middle of the pile of leaves that Mr. C is trying to rake! 😆
my Labrador is the household chief of security ... its an important role
As a fellow Labrador ear manipulator I love the ending. Comfort is one of the most valuable commodity at the moment, and it's very kind of you to share yours with those poor souls who don't have dogs, let alone Labradors, of their own ❤
I really think I am speaking for all of us(olive and mabel fans) welcome back  girls  ( and andrew) you were missed  and yes you have a VERY important job, don't ever doubt it.  take care all
Thank God you didn't go away.
Your videos brighten my day!
Dogs just make me smile every day and seeing Olive and Mabel is always a joy.
Oh yes, Andrew, a pay rise for both of them, not only for the work they do around the house and garden but for the joy and smiles they bring in our lives!😊😊Thank you 🙏
Olive and Mabel never fail to make my day a little brighter. ❤️‍🔥
Emotional support dogs.  And I'm pretty sure grey squirrels would make amphibious landings given half the chance.
That’s just shenanigans…. Love it.
I wouldn't lift a finger either if you spoke to me as you speak to these darling doggies. Ya grump. OK, payrise.  Better.
It's actually more beneficial for your lawn if you leave the leaves where they fall.  They provide needed nutrients when they rot as well as providing a place for beneficial insects to breed.  If you must remove them, please pile them in an unused corner of your property so they can be of help to endangered hedgehogs who use the leaves (and perhaps the leaf pile itself) for nesting material.  The decomposing leaves are the perfect breeding ground for beetles, the hedgehogs' primary food source which is sadly rapidly dwindling in supply.  Later on, if you need to move or tidy the leaf pile, please check it for hibernating hedgehogs before you move anything.  Thanks!
Love this, we're having to pay for our Lab's knee surgery next week which is a struggle but these videos brighten up my day and make me realise it'll all be worth it once we're running on the beach again next year!
I love watching their adventures. Brings a smile to my day. You've captured their point of view perfectly.😂
You always make me smile.
Just love these videos 🥰Olive and Mabel don't need to work for a living - that's what being a Dog Dad is all about - providing them with the best life - which you do admirably ❤🐾🐾
Living the dream 🥰
Excellent job Olive and Mable!  You softened the harsh edges of my day....love you all.
Good dogs 💕🍪🍪
I LOVE EM!
Ahh, what fun can be had with dogs and wet (or dry) autumn leaves 😅. My poodle is an expert in autumn leaf pile maintenance 😂
what is said after ‘by the way…..’?
I lost my Henrietta last week, 13 and 1/2, she looked just like Olive, it was pain and pleasure to see this today. Never stop. ❤
They are your bosses. They have been training you to give them unconditional love.
Love your videos Andrew xx
In this rather mad world, how good it is to know that Olive and Mabel are out there doing their job to comfort us all. And, thank you Mr. Cotter for sharing these two wonderful pups with us. I felt such joy when you showed them romping on the beach.😀
Don’t want an angry Dolly Parton showing up at your door! 😂 Somehow I don’t think she’d mind. 😊❤️
Never stop…..love your videos ❤
I love it when they have the cameras on them and their ears flop and flap about, so adorable! ❤❤❤
The ears flapping up and down was an adorable sight!
🤣🐕🐕 Lov Labs
Olive and Mabel are so good at their jobs.🥺
They're back! And sorely missed!!
Fair performance review,  the girls provide a vital and much appreciated service 😊
“Additional ear benefits” ❤
Those two loveable girls do everything in unison!! What a fantastic bond they have, together and with Andrew❤. Just love seeing them snuggled up together after a hard day,s fun. I so enjoy seeing their antics 😊
Perfect. Just perfect!
Andrew:Your videos are Amazing ❤.Olive and Mabel are so adorable❤❤.
theyre ADORABLE - thats their job & they excel
I was tearing up there a bit in the end. A troubled world indeed. Thank you, Andrew, for the video.
This channel can be considered a safe port in a stormy world. A tranquil eddy of water that somehow staves of the maelstrom of the open seas.
You girls keep on doing what you do best and that is look gorgeous and make the world smile. ❤ Ps. Love the golf caddying 😅😅
Another beautiful video❤
Love the camera angles!
They are both clearly eco warriors, going out in all weathers, visiting lots of habitats, even plunging into cold water, all to inspect the state of the environment . Well done Olive and Mabel.
Joy bringers Olive & Mabel beautiful thank you from Aotearoa New Zealand 🙋🏻‍♂️
But Mr Cotter the mantra is " Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life." The girls have taken it to the extreme of course and it helps if one has staff. That's you by the way.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Love the beach POV 😁 Is that a special dog attachment Go Pro? #LoveDogs
At least you had a branch manager whilst raking the leaves 😂
Olive and Mabel do the  most important job of all. They make us all happy.
They are the decorations of life.
Perhaps see what happens if you pour them both a cup of ambition?
🤔 They give everyone that knows them joy ! That's a VERY important job 😉😍🥰
Lovely to see Olive and Mabel again. They always cheer me up
Thank you so much for still putting on these videos they are such a joy to watch.
Mabel, I am also wondering when “The Littlest Hobo” is coming back.
truly lovely.
Always makes me happy to see an Olive and Mabel with Andrew Cotter video.  Good job!
Chief providers of comfort and distraction in a troubled world is the most important job . And they’re doing it magnificently. 😂
Those two just melt your heart ❤️ please keep these videos coming x
How sweet. ❤😂
I saw a cartoon strip with a cat explaining to a dog that cats are descended from the gods and revered by ancient Egyptians as such. The dog replied, "And I am a very good dog! Such a good dog."
Adorable dogs   ❤❤❤
They kept me calm during Covid.  Thank you.
Emotional support to an entire nation😂. That’s a big job
This was just lovely. Thank you so much for sharing them (and your wit) with us.
Love it! xxx
A pay rise is well deserved. 😍
Lovely!. Nuff said.... 🙂
Love your videos!😁❤️ Mabel and Olive, two happy dogs just living their lives! They're are helping, motivating and supervising!😉 Greetings from Sweden!🇸🇪
If anyone looked at me with such love for me in their eyes, I’d be happy to have them around even if they didnt do anything much in particular.
There's no sound
Olive and Mabel are top class smile tutors. I can’t help but smile when I see you all on your ‘shenanigans’.  Thank you 😊
Love them, my Mabel and Jess works just as hard doing nothing all day 😂❤😅
Thank you. I always smile when I see a new video of Olive and Mabel loving life and loving you.
The twig. 😂😂😂
The time I spend with Olive & Mable  is the best part of each day. ❤️❤️
Adorable. as always.
Dolly Parton LOL! Wouldn't be surprised if she's seen these!   I love the back-cam views. Glad you leave the sound on them too. Really makes me feel like I'm in the scene. Maybe an elf.
Yes they do the comfort work amazingly
Mabel went and got a rake to help you. She wants to be like you. That is unconditional admiration. ❤
Chief provider of comfort and distraction in a troubled world…best description of a dog - worth every dollar, vet bill, walk, poo pick up, couch stealing, hole digging.
Very very necessary work
IDK, Influencers seem to be a serious thing!  I’m definitely influenced by these beautiful beasties.  Thanks for this lovely video!
Olive and Mabel are the best , the job they both do is giving you a happy life , wish we all had a olive and Mabel in our life’s 🐾🐾
You three souls brighten my own!  Thank you for content that buoys us all!  Sending you well wishes!
What a touching ending. The three of you are a comfort in an increasingly difficult world, thank you.
Supervisor!  Life Coach! ❤
Love their Shenanigans. A bit of calm and peace in a day. Good work.
Love your videos and your sense of humour and the love you have for your dogs.  They have a wonderful life.🤗🇨🇦
Chief providers of distraction and comfort in a troubled world! Olive and Mabel for President.
I love Olive and Mabel videos.
The ears! 🥰🥰🥰
OMG best dog dad EVER! Those are some happy girls - looks like y’all had an absolutely amazing (work)day. 😊
Once again they prove they're worth every penny they earn. They are my balm for my tough days, bringing me many smiles & warm feelings. They are very Good Dogs! ❤🐕🦮🥰😘
I could start the day with a Dolly Parton song and two loyal dogs, it definitely puts a smile on my face
Those dogs are truly beautiful.
❤ Dogs are the best!
Give them ALLLLL the pay rises!
Somehow I feel that Dolly Parton would not mind a bit.
Their job is to lift our spirits and they do that exceptionally well!!
Lol. Leave the leaves to compost over the winter. If you must use a lawn mower on them but leave the leafs to rot. Woof!
Their role in life is to be your forever loyal, worshipers, Andrew Cotter. And they do it 24/7/365. That's right, even when they're sleeping.
I mean, shenanigans, yes. But ALSO goings on. It’s the ‘goings on’ that qualifies it as work.
❤
Chief Provider of Comfort and Distraction in a Troubled World is a PERFECT job title - for both of them!
Andrew, come on there only job is to be beautiful which they are
Dearest Olive and Mabel🥰🥰🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I teared up a bit there. Watching Olive and Mabel did help me forget about the sad world we live in. A big thank you to their servant for this video 😊
So lovely to see you all!❤ Everyone looking fit and healthy…😊
Thank you for the much needed dose of Olive and Mabel therapy, along with your Scottish accent!
they've got an awfully large yard
Olive and Mabel remind me of my black lab, Chilli.  She sees herself as a supervisor when it comes to garden work.  If I could just harness the energy in her tail! ❤❤
Love Olive and Mabel ❤.
The Dolly Parton song! 😂😂😂 so so funny!
@mrandrecotter I couldn't help but notice that Mabel was holding a sleeping Tribble on the couch, yet you mentioned nothing about your new pet.
Awe, picking up a stick certainly helps with lawn work!!👍👍
Awesome Buddies! Enjoy every "working" with them!
OMG A Littlest Hobo reference!! A subtle nod to Canada LOL!
biggest job to date? making this old curmudgeon smile and be happy for a brief moment out of this current chaos of anger and ugly! thank you. Truly.
thanks, i needed this
Two beautiful puppies you have there , I haven't put the camera on my dog in a while but here's when I did it ha ha    https://youtu.be/EOetpGQF3f0?si=J1IDc7X8DteQreN7
This clip is Designer approved. ✅
LOL!  So happy to see you all looking well and fabulous creation. Thanks and I agree with Melissa Thompson!
Thank you
There you are! There are my friends! Yes all 3 of you ARE actually  chief providers of distraction and comfort in a troubled world. Your presence is priceless!! Good to see you!!😁♥️♥️♥️
What a look of love! Warms my heart. Thank you for the camera attached to the dogs. What a perspective. You live in a wonderful area for pets and people.
…” still wondering if ‘The Littlest Hobo’ is coming back”… Just love these adorable pups and their witty, kind, loving Dad! 🇨🇦🥰😅❤️👍🏻🦮🐕‍🦺
Olive and Mable are expert level love collectors! Thank you Mr Cotter!
That’s it! That last one!
Chief comforter in the world is by far the most important job. Just so you know, that is way higher than President or Prime Minister.  I think they need a raise.
Those sweet faces!!!  Sooooo precious.  🐶🐶💕💕
I loved this.! Cheered me up in this crazy world. Being a Doggo is hard work! :o)
I needed that today. Thank you!
Carpe diem and cuddles: great work, girls! Wishing you a lovely autumn. 🍁🍁🍁
I absolutely love the dog cams!
Lovely sweet Olive with her graying whiskers 🤗
Additional ear benefits indeed!
i miss olive and mabel. they were a bright light in the depths of covid. they are still a bright light.  thanks for sharing your two beautiful canines with us...i miss mine so.
Showed your latest to our dog Caitie to see if it might inspire her to do something useful. It did, if you include fertilising the patio as a useful job. No pay raise for her. 🙄
Good dog!
Definitely deserve a pay rise. ❤❤
"Find a job you love, you will never have to work a day in your life." Such a great team.💖
Well said.
"Chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world."   For all of us. Thank you.
Olive & Mabel are the best therapy dogs in the world 🌟🥰❤️ Thanks to you Mr Cotter for sharing them with us ❤️  🇦🇺
Thank you for, yet again, another wonderful video. They really do bring a smile to my face when I see you have uploaded more content. In return, I hope life is treating you and your family well.
Olive and Mabel, I’ve missed you terribly. Please don’t be gone so long this time. ❤❤
I name this time of year - the game all dog owners dread - "Where's the poop?!"  If you don't see them pooping, the game is on and you win if you get none smeared on your shoe you didn't see beneath a leaf.   Your videos definitely deserve an award for helping so many people feel better during a worldwide pandemic and the hard times after, when they felt there was almost no goodness left in the world.  You, Olive and Mabel have brought hope and smiles to thousands upon thousands of lives.  You are one of the few that can say they truly made a difference for the better in the state of the world. Thank you sir and Olive and Mabel for allowing us into your world
“Chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world”. Yes, I think that is a very important job indeed.  Thanks Mabel and Olive for another really enjoyable video. And thanks Andrew for helping them with production!
Just loved it so thank you to the three of you!❤
I thought the camera POV flopping ears was the cutest thing about this video...until I saw the camera POV tandem-joined-at-the-shoulder swimming.   I miss my Asta girl so thank you for sharing your precious girls with us. Much love & appreciation from Kentucky U.S. 💙🌿💙🌿💙🌿💙🌿💙🌿💙🌿💙🌿💙
When the world is a mess and we all despair, Olive and Mabel come back to us.
Well thank you for another day in the lives of Mabel and Olive. I really love them and I love where you live.
Don't tease them like that! Dolly would ADORE them, as we all do, and give them her blessing for a 9-to-5 usage.
''But we do Pawtrols'' ♥
‘Chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world.’ Yep - that’s what we need right now Andrew. Brought a tear to my eye. Thank you.
"chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world" is the most important job in the world. And these two are very very good at their jobs.❤
They are so cute!
I am exhausted just watching “A day in the life of Olive,Mabel and Mr. Cotter”!   Keeping up is a job for sure😅
“You don’t want an angry Dolly Parton at your door.” 😂😂😂
Thank you, Andrew!  I love you and your girls l❤️❤️❤️
Olive and Mabel give more than you know. I was so happy to see all of you, even for 3 minutes, and Im certain Im not the only one. They were a bright spot in an otherwise cr*p day.
Thank you Olive Mabel and Mr Cotter for many videos that make me smile laugh and make me believe there's still good in this world.  Hugs and kisses from the USA.
Oh, thank you, Andrew, for this.  I’ve missed all three of you.
Aww, just what I needed to relax after my day of returning social work calls. Between your voice/humour & the pups - hits the spot! Thanks so much for the gift of all you do!
❤❤❤
They are SO lovely 😍
Fellow Scot here thrilled to live vicariously through Olive and Mabel’s shenanigans. We lost our 14 year old Staffie a year ago and she’s hugely missed. Loved your thoughtful comments about Staffies in your book. Enjoy the girls and your adventures 😊 🍂
"I know you think you're providing a vital service there, but really, that's just. . . shenanigans." True of my dogs as well. I must admit I'm sad to see the grey on Olive's muzzle. Reminds me that dogs do NOT live long enough. . .
Their job is to bring us joy which they do really well!
You neutralized that threat….😂
They're influencers ! My chihuahua Dempsey loves watching them. 😂😂
Thank you for posting this and spreading some happiness around 💖💖💖
So glad you guys are back.  Missed you all so much.  ❤❤❤
That last job is essential.  And they provide so much comfort to so many people.
Oh My Gosh!  I so very much hope THE DOLLY PARTON knows about Olive and Mabel!
❤ Love Olive and Mabel so much! Such a joy to see them living their best life ❤❤❤
I lost it  at 3:10 and just had a moment when I missed my Boxer - goddamn it!  Thank you Mr Cotter.
Thanks for my wide smile.💓
Don't forget the constant jobs of hair production and distribution!😉
Just lovely. Thank you for sharing them
I needed this today. ❤
They adore you, you know!? We love them so and are grateful that you three helped us through the pandemic!
Thank you so much Mr Cotter, Olive and Mabel this is so pure and precious you can’t help but smile from ear to ear and to be honest they provide a very welcome relief from our very troubled world so I consider that a very important job indeed ❤❤
Georgous girls 😊😊
Love the dog cams.
animals never fail to cheer me up when I'm fed up of the human world
They do their job so well they make it look like play!!!!
I love how their ears flop when they're running (and Andrew has the camera on their backs)!  Makes me miss my old dog, who looked a lot like Olive!
Olive seems really dressed down 😢
Just when the world starts getting too dark again, along come Olive and Mabel to make things bright!  Thank you!
Beautiful video, your dogs are just the best ❤
I think Dolly Parton would be honored 😂😊
The love they give is priceless!
❤❤❤
I wonder if you know Andrew, how much joy, you and your fantastic dogs give to others?  Thank you.
Shenanigans😆😆😆
your closing comment about comfort and love is their ultimate job - and a job well done❤️
Mr. Cotter - unless you frequently fetch sticks, shed copiously and wag your butt when happy (the other side of you 🍆 doesn’t count) you’re really in no position to judge the difficulty here are you?  Whereas Olive and Mabel do ALL of that AND provide riveting commentary on such popular sports as amphibious squirrel racing as a side hustle on YouTube.  What?  You didn’t know about that?  Where on earth did you think that other 100K YouTube Subscriber plaque in your home came from? 🙄
Shenanigans is such a fantastic word. Thank you.
Labrador Go-Pro videos should be a category in the Academy Awards! AND the Winner IS … Olive & Mabel!
I can think of no better job than to bring joy and smiles to millions! What a resume these two pups have! Your job, Mr. Cotter, is to share them! Thank you, all three, for jobs so well done! 😊💕
Chief provider of comfort and distraction in a troubled world is the main job of all dogs!
Is the beach, Ainsdale?
Thank you for the smiles. Balm and sunshine in our troubled world.
I rate shenanigans high on a dog's duties. Good to see the girls, thanks for sharing.
Shenanigans are a very specialized field of knowledge and not to be taken lightly.
Their job is to have fun and be adorable and they do it brilliantly
I think both Olive and Mabel did a fine job and service of making sure there were no squirrel landing craft on their assigned sector of the creek. And Mabel did her usual fine job of finding sticks and bringing them to the attention of management, while Olive rescued an errant golf ball that apparently won't be recorded on a certain person's scorecard.
Olive’s face when you mentioned her loss of decorum!😅😅
A query from our Cessna (pit bill): “Is deer poop as slippery as duck poop? Mom did a freestyle _glissade_ in the pasture the other day; if deer poop is anything like duck poop, it _is_ a credible threat, Mr. Andrew.”  PS (from Mom): Thank you, Olive & Mabel, for your service. You too, Mr. Andrew. 💛🖤
Mabel collecting little twigs in an effort to help dad rake is the best!!!🤣❤️💯🐾
Great to see the girls again. What a joy they are. I’d pay them to do nothing. Ladies of leisure, can only give pleasure! There’s a lyric for you Dolly. 😜
Never stop making these wonderful videos Mr C they are more of a comfort in these troubling time than you imagine. 👍👍👍
I’m loving the go-pro’s - made me laugh so much with the flappy ears ❤ thank you for sharing x
Olive and Mabel are just like the government they think they are providing a useful service but its all just shenanigan's!
Our 2 Labs give comic relief + comfort in troubling (whew) times.  Earning their keep here in the Great Northwest.
Chief providers of distraction and comfort in a troubled world...❤
LOVE these two precious babies 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Can never get enough Olive and Mabel.  They have the best Dad :)
❤
howe old is Olive now? good to see the team out and about!
Priceless!
chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world. Thankyou so much
Oh to have Olive and Mabel's life.
They are psycho therapists and personal trainers
Perfect in the comfort and distraction roles.❤
Loved seeing Olive and Mabel enjoying the simple things in life…..we need to take a lesson from them❤🦴❤️🦴
The most important job ever! ❤ love dog cam 😂
like the Kwikee mart hot dogs in the Simpsons, they are 'for decorative purposes only" . Author Louise Penny mentions Olive and Mabel on page 155 of her book The Madness of Crowds.
Raking leaves? Oh my. Vermont laughs really hard.
Just brilliant! Such a joy…thank you ❤❤
Sending love to Olive and Mabel ❤❤.  The girls always warm my heart and your comments always make me laugh.  Thank you Mr. Cotter ❤
Thank you for another wonderful update on Olive and Mabel's work ethic. Love to watch them!
Nice one again Mr Cotter, go steady they is super faithfull companions and bring a lot of joy, not only to you and yours but your plethora of ardent followers!😂
Another wonderful post, bless you all 😊
The three of you always brighten my day 🥰
Protecting the beaches from squirrels in amphibious landing craft ... an essential task indeed
"Chief providers of comfort and distraction in a troubled world." Indeed they are. I support that pay rise! 🥰
They do the best job in the world - they love you and so you love them!
Labrador ears 😍🤩🥰
I really needed this today... thanks Andrew! ❤
Yep, three minutes forty six seconds of no worldly cares. Thanks for the upload.
You three spead such joy!!! Thank you ❤
Love them ❤❤
Olive and Mabel have to be two of the happiest, well adjusted and healthy fur babies.❤
Joyous....although it looks like the chewy bunny is temporarily out of favour.
Thank you, I needed that.
Olive and Mabel, love your work
Lost my black lab Smuckers a few weeks ago, Mabel and Olive are so precious and remind me of the wonderful memories of Smuckers.🐶❤️
"Chief Providers of Distraction and Comfort in a Troubled World" will be the reason given when Olive and Mabel are awarded the DBE (Dogs of the British Empire)  in the.King's New Year/Birthday Honours List. They certainly meet the criteria...  "A pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity (usually, but not exclusively, at national level), or in a capacity which will be recognised by peer groups as inspirational and significant nationally and demonstrates sustained commitment."
"Chief provider......."❤
Wonderful video as always ❤❤
❤💖❤labrador ears♥💖♥
It feels like I’m riding on Mabel’s back! Brilliant, as always. ❤️
すごくかわいくて、お利口さんだなあ…🐕‍🦺🦮♥️
Terribly important jobs they both have bringing a bit of comfort these days. And they’re so good at it!! Thank you 😊
Truly, a vital service.
I was being your best friend and loving you and life😊
I think their job today was to make all of us who watch the video laugh, smile and feel happy to see 2 dogs who are so dearly loved by you!
Looking cute is a really tough job
Olive & Mabel's job is supervising to make sure all is great in your world, so you can help them spread joy to others! 😊❤ Love the water & beach portion of the video & Mabel's "sneak" attack on Olive.  Thank you for sharing your dogs with everyone. 😊
Of course they work! They are emotional support animals for millions of us on the internet.
Olive and Mabel cam, love the view from their perspective!! ❤
OMG an Olive/Mabel/Dolly Parton crossover would be priceless. It would break the internet!
MUCH LOVE TO OLIVE , MABEL , & MR COTTER ♥️ ❤️ ❤
I wish I could wake up to an Olive and Mabel video everyday 🥰
So cute!
Lovely!  😊😊😊 Was just thinking of you all yesterday and wondered when you would post again. Thanks!
Thank you This always makes me smile
Dolly Parton 😂😂😂
Oh bless you - that took me back to the.Zoom calls of Lockdown - how did we get nostalgic for that ?  This is such a source of joy in times of gloom. Thank you Andrew  Olive and Mabel - our rays of 🌞
Gulp! You made me tear up at the end!  You're such a good narrator, have you ever thought of going into broadcasting? Thanks to the three of you, as always
Their pelts are so healthy and their bodies so fit!  Olive's pelt looks blue it's so black.What wonderful lives they have!
Sweet doggie dogs. Woof Woof !!
I LOVE OLIVE AND MABEL, thank you for sharing their day with us ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
So fun!!
These are the videos I love. Just Olive and Mabel being Olive and Mabel. With a bit of Scotland thrown in. Thank you, Food Source documentarian.
It's so lovely to see Olive and Mabel again, doing what they do best. Looking cute and supervising you, Mr. Cotter!
I cant help thinking that Olive is always sitting back and judging you and the commentary! Great video as ever, never fails to make me smile.. Thank you
I can assure you that Dolly Parton would love Olive & Mabel. She'd probably be quite tickled for her song to be used as background to describe their busy day.
❤❤❤
Love the dog-back view shots!  Mabel and Olive are dogs.  "Dog" is their job, and they're both highly accomplished at it.
Wonderful to see those lovely girls again  Many Thanks
we do what we do best..........being your best friends!
When we walk past the farm here, I tell my two ('Sack of Elbows' Saluki X and 'Sack of Spuds' Labrador) "don't bark at the sheep dogs, they work for a living."
They interact with you in a cuddly, clappy,  intimate way. I wouldn't let you do that.
Their work is keeping you ( and all of us) happy❤❤❤❤❤
Dog Ears are best ears.
… working… dogs! 😂
"Chief provider of distraction and comfort in a troubled world".  Even on the very worst of days, it can be "all better" with the glance of a dog's eyes, a wag of their tail, or a snore that says it's okay, everything is okay.  What a lousy place this would be without our true and loyal friends.  I owe them my life, and more.
Love the shot of them swimming in the water hazard! Labradors are so good for comfort & distraction. I have an 11.5 yr old boy, Hugo - who looks like a cousin to Olive.
Assistant Branch Manager 😆
these two with you always make me tear up with joy and thankfulness for the beauty of dogs and how we (humans and dogs) love each other and. provide constant delight.
I've been having a great day so far, but getting this video's notification + watching it have indeed been the highlights! Kisses, to Olive & Mabel 😘
😘😘😘 Kisses all-around for this Ty.  What's Dolly Parton not happy about? 🤔
Thanks for sharing their excellent work with us 💜
Such shameless joy & innocence! If only everyone could embrace the peace your pets provide for us, xoxo!
They both bring love and laughter to all of us! That’s the best job ever!❤️😍🥰🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗😊
my stick!  there are many like it but this one is mine!
Awww brilliant!! their job?? To love you unconditionally ❤❤❤
I got so excited when I seen you had posted,watching The girls from enterprise, Alabama!!🇺🇸
Superb video Mr. C, rather funny and touching
How I love retrievers.   Thank you Mr Cotter, Olive, and Mabel. 🐾❤️
I think their main job is gaffering. They do it rather well too. They are also fantastic therapy dogs, and not just for Dad. Great to see them. Thanks for posting.
What do they do? The remind us of joy. Thank you, girls and Mr. Cotter.
Just adorable 😊 The end was heart melting ❤
Humans do (useless stuff), dogs _are_ (loving and adorable).  The irony: we call ourselves human _beings_...
My dogs would say their job is to protect the estate from the threat of all the wild creatures in the woods.  They're okay against the squirrel menace, but kind of useless against anything larger.  They also fancy themselves to be food tasters and insist on sampling anything we eat to ensure it hasn't gone off. BTW, that's some pretty impressive image stabilization on your doggie cams!
I have to say, that’ll put a stop to my doom scrolling, which I’ve noticed I’m doing 😂!  So, thank you
So fabulous, as ever
Such a heart melting moment when Mabel turned up with one twig in her mouth while Olive supervised the work going on in general.  Otherwise this looked like a hard day's work for two very eager dogs.  No job is done is too insignificant to mention!  Bless both their hearts and noses and yours too mrandrewcotter for treating us to a lovely video from our favourite pair!
I don't know what's more funny..your commentary or the dog's reactions?! 🤣🤣
Hey eating is a job!!! 😂❤
Absolutely love you 3 !
Great dog cam shots.  These videos are soooo good for my blood pressure and stress levels. Thank you Olive and Mabel and Andrew of course🤣
That pay rise is very well deserved and probably well overdue Mr. C. Thank you
Olive and Mabel are emotional support for people they've never even met.
Look adorable, wag hard, and bring joy to many! Best job in the world and very well done too!
Olive is supervisor and Mabel is stick holder 😆 another Great video! Dogging is hard work! You summed it up beautifully in the end! Thanks, I needed this! ♥️♥️
You three always make my day, Mr. Cotter!!!!! Thank you!! xo
Givers of Joy to all who see them! That's their j0ob and they do it so well.  Thanks!
Yes. My dogs provide great comfort in a world gone mad. 😊🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺
Here here. You all get a raise! So wonderful to have you around. tytyty.
They would both look fabby in a Dolly Look-a-like festival, maybe you too!  Thank you, for the distraction and comfort in a troubled world.
I wish that they could talk...
That trip to the beach could be considered a business trip…if she did her business there.
Olive and Mabel's job is the best in the world: they make us (and you) happy!! Also, they are gorgeous!! ❤❤
Still smiling over the Amphibious Landing Squirrels visual but those flappy ear action shots made the video. ❤️❤️❤️
Their jobs, of which they are CEO's, are Head of Looking Cute department.  Bonuses in store for both of them, no doubt 🦴
Luckiest dogs in the world!
Labs have the most wonderful ears; like velvet.  Beautiful girls!
❤
Another wonderful video!  I must disagree, however, with the assertion that the girls are not working. 😊🤔 Olive and Mabel are Oscar-worthy actresses who bring smiles to the world!
"Waiting for the Littlest Hobo to come back" 😂....so funny as always 💛💛
Excellent I love watching your videos with Olive and Mable.
The job all three of you do, keeping me smiling in a world that has lost the plot, is invaluable. All of you deserve a pay rise!
Just brilliant Mr Cotter
Thank you for your service, the 3 of you. ❤
Lovely stuff. Can I ask how you mounted the camera ?
Thanks for that Andrew it’s just what I needed today
Their job is dopamine distributors. And if they're anything like mine, they don't get paid enough. :-)
The hard work that the girls do at cheering us all up is inestimable.
Their job is to look adorable, make woof sounds and expect cuddles😊😊😊😊 therefore I give them 100% for their dedication and full marks for an excellent performance all round 😊😊😊😊
Life is always better with an Olive and Mabel video.
Oh, we all love Olive and Mabel!!
Mabel and Olive clearly living their best lives thanks to you Mr. Cotter.  Thanks for sharing them with us sir!
Gosh, their expressive eyes..."chief providers of comfort and distractions," indeed 😊.
Thank you for these videos. We used to ask Mr. Spot, the Saint Bernard, what he did on his day off. He couldn't sleep that was his job.
Olive and Mabel spread Joy to so many people around the world! That's a very important job.
"Chief providers of distracton in a troubled world" love it, thats exactly what my 2 labs do as well  😀
So glad you’re back. x
Wonderful day!! Thank you for sharing 😂❤
Job, job???  They’re super stars known the world over and it’s bloody hard work!  🤣🤣🤣
Hardest working dogs on YouTube 😂
Another great video! Soft ear benefits are the BEST!
Dogs love poop of any kind!
Filling our hearts with joy, job well done!❤❤❤
Olive and Mable make my heart burst with love and happiness, they do a great job!
Certainly brought cheer to my day!❤
Their job is to provide you with company that is a very hard and difficult job
They did their jobs well.  We're all happier now!
Team Shenanigans 🐕🐕
Theirs is not a job,it’s an adventure!
I want my job to be watching Olive and Mabel ❤
Aw - they both do a great job 💕
❤️🐿️❤️🐿️❤️🐿️❤️
Thank you so much, Mr. Cotter, for the relief of seeing lovely indolent Olive and Mabel who are indeed a comfort and distraction in this troubled world. Their ears, their "I'm innocent" expressions, and theit surroundings with you beside them are just about the only videos keeping me sane at the moment.
There you are, hello! 👋🏼  Yes, chief providers of distraction and comfort in a troubled world, sadly essential. Chins up, eyes forward and all of that…
I assume they both lost their jobs at the office. Did the Kevin-from-accounts scandal finally catch up with them? So sad.
❤️❤️❤️
Thank you.
Love your doggies, and your brilliant commentary, Mr. Cotter.   Wishing you all long and happy lives together.  Cheers from Canada!
Still haven’t borrowed the neighbor’s leaf blower, I see.😉  It is good to see Olive & Mabel doing what they’re best at. Making human lives so much more enjoyable.
What about flour cleaning?  Our black Lab does that well when food is dropped.
My dogs would have jumped into the piles of leaves and mess them up.  Good girls.
Olive losing her cool is no big deal because she never had any cool to begin with.  But when Mabel loses it at the beach, you know it's goin to be a great day.
“ I don’t trust people who doesn’t like dogs”. Bill Murray, actor. Well, I agree. ❤❤❤❤❤
We have XL Bullys and we have Olive and Mabel,they're gorgeous.
The cutest freeloaders ever!😊 I have one smaller version myself. Everytime we pass an assistance dog, i give him the same lecture!
Ear flaps when running at full pelt is just the best 😂
Caddying the water hazard looks like a legit service worth paying for.
Love the dog-cam shots!  Wonderful to see the girls in action once again.  Thank you!
What jobs do you do hmmmm 🤔 sleep, eat, walk, have fun, a bit of leaf rustling, home for a doze, dinner, sleep and....repeat. It's a dogs life, but with Olive and Mabel who would want it any other way. Bless their paws 🐾💞.
"You neutralised  that threat " Priceless.😂 Thank you for warming my heart. Great job.👍
Their job is to provide YouTube content and revenue, duh!
Chief Provider of Distraction and Comfort - a very high status position for both girls I would say.
Mabel and Olive make work look like fun 😊😊
Hard work staying so perfect. Full time job ❤
They're starting to show a few grey hairs around the snout - showing their maturity:) God bless them.
Olive and Mabel are welcome to come "work" with me anytime!
Olive, Mabel and Mr. Cotter = Best part of my day.🐾🐾
A very valuable job.  One of the most valued in my life, every day.  Dogs are a comfort and a joy.  Love to Olive and Mabel.
And now I can smile Those cute ears running on the beach.
Their job is to hang on every word you say XX
Good morning from the South Island of New Zealand. Starting the day with my lab Molly and a great Dane called Rosie. My perfect distractions from an imperfect world!
Great stuff! Still giggling so thank you to all three ❤
Awwwwww!!
Their job is to provide smiles.  For you.  For us.  They do it well.  (And I vote that retrieving is a job as well)
I think it was Marc Anthony, who once said "If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life." Let’s take a moment to reflect on those words and a beautiful example that Olive and Mabel have shared with us today 😂 Cheers, Anna x
They do work - their job is to supervise your jobs.
What a great day. A new Olive and Mabel video!
So happy to see your sweet girls living their best life, especially during these troubled times ! 💖💖💖
Being awesome and keeping dad in the best company possible are their jobs and they perform them exceptionally well. I think they should both be employees of the month every month.
Andrew, thank you so much for this treat. Olive and Mabel a new video. You really should suggest to the girls to give a raise to the grounds keeper .❤
Also, favorite meme in my house is when Mr. Cotter said, "with a look that says I'm doin' what I wont and I have zero respect for you".  I'll say that about twice a day because it's true and epitomizes the Lab, "everything is amazing and I want to destroy the couch cushions".
Such happy Labs, love the ear shots when they are running - great 🐾🐾
They make everyone smile 😊
So lovely to see you and the doggies! Thanks for the laughs. Remember, they're doggies. Don't be to hard on them😅
love it ❤
Olive has always been my favourite.
Cinder says “retrieving is TOO a job!” 🐾🐾🥰
This is my happy place, watching Olive and Mabel with my English Labs, also related and also Black and Yellow.  Cheers from Southern California!
Sometimes just being beautiful is enough.
Their vital service is keeping us entertained!
I always look forward to another Olive and Mabel video. Thank you, Andrew, and of course, thanks to Olive and Mabel. 😊
You don't want an angry Dolly Parton at your door 😂😂😂
Yay!
