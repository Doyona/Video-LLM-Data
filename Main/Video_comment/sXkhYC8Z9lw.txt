여기서 지수는 더 이상 노래를 불렀다고 상상하나요?! YG는 지수가 더 노래를 더 할 수 있습니다 그냥 작은 노래?! 무슨 일이예요?! 지수는 더 많은 노래를 내 편견이고 나는 BLINCK이지만 세리오에서 나는 그에게 내가 불평하고 지수를 제외 중지 라인을 주지 않는 더 많은 노래를 하지 않는 지수가 필요합니다, 지수 또한 그녀를 배제하지 않는 블랙 핑크입니다.

Turkısh blink   Çırpılmış yumurta tarifi Nasıl yapılır?  Tavanın altını açıp iyice ısıtın.  Yumurtaları derin bir kasede sarısı ve beyazı kaynaşana dek iyice çırpın.  Yumurtalara 1 çay kaşığı tuz ilave edin.  Kremayı yumurtalara ilave edin ve pürüzsüz bir kıvam alana kadar çırpın.  Tereyağını kızgın tavada eritip her tarafa iyice yayın.  Yumurtayı tavaya dökünve altı pişmeye başlayınca kenardan ortaya doğru sıyırarak yumurtayı karıştırın.  Yarım çay kaşığı daha tuz ekleyip yumurtanız iyice pişmeden tavayı ocaktan alın.  Yumurta kendi sıcağıyla biraz daha pişecektir.  Çırpılmış yumurtanızı tavadan alıp üzerine karabiber ve ince kıyılmış taze soğan serpin.  Yanında kızarmış ekmekle sıcacık servis edin. Afiyet olsun…  106

Ispanak Yemeği Tarifi İçin Malzemeler 1 kg ıspanak 1 adet kuru soğan Yarım çay bardağı pirinç 2 yemek kaşığı sıvı yağ 1 yemek kaşığı domates salçası Tuz Karabiber Pul biber Ispanak Yemeği Tarifi Yapılışı Başlangıç olarak ıspanakları temizleyelim. Diğer taraftan soğanı  doğrayıp sıvı yağda pembeleşene dek kavuralım. Salçayı ilave edelim. Ardından ıspanakları da ekleyelim ve ıspanaklar eriyinceye kadar kavuralım. Yarım çay bardağı yıkanmış pirinci, tuz ve baharatları da ilave edelim. 1 su bardağı kaynar suyu da ekleyerek tencerenin kapağını kapatalım, kısık ateşte pirinçler yumuşayana dek pişirelim. Yanında yoğurtla servis edelim, afiyet olsun… Ispanak Yemeğinin Püf Noktaları; Ispanak seçimlerinde küçük ve orta boylarda olması her zaman için yemeğin daha güzel ve lezzetli olmasını sağlar. Ispanakların iyice yıkayıp sirkeli suda bekletilmelidir. Topraklarından ve bakterilerin den arınması için. Ispanakları ocakta söndükten sonra pirinçler ilave edilir. Tarifte su oranına dikkat edilmelidir. Kendi zevkinize göre ayarlayabilirsiniz elbette ama çok sulu olmamasına özen gösterilmeli. Tencerenin ağzı kapatıp 25 dk kadar sonra ıspanak ve pirinçler pişmiş olacaktır. Ispanak yemeğimiz hazır ister sıcak, ister ılık olarak tüketilebilir. Ispanak faydaları İçerisinde bol miktarda A vitamini, C vitamini, E vatamini ve K vitamini bulunmaktadır. Ispanak içerisindeki besinler sayesinde kanser hücrelerine karşı etkilidir. İçerdiği K vitamini sayesinde kemik gelişimine katkı sağlar. Ispanak hipertansiyonu dengeler. Ispanak düzenli tüketildiğinde stresten uzak tutar ve insana rahatlama hissi verir. Sindirim sistemi için oldukça faydalıdır. Ispanak bağışıklık sistemini güçlendirir.

Kıymalı Patates Dolması Tarifi Nasıl Yapılır? Patateslerin içini tatlı kaşığı yardımıyla oyun.  Oymuş olduğunuz patatesleri kızgın yağda çok yumuşamayacak kadar kızartın.  Kıyma harcını hazırlamak için; bir tavada sıvı yağ ve soğanı kavurun.  Üzerine kıymayı ekleyip kavurmaya devam edin.  Kavrulan kıymanın üzerine kırmızı kapya biber, yeşil biber, rendelenmiş sarımsak, soyulmuş, doğranmış domates ve tuzu ekledikten sonra 3-4 dakika daha kavurup ocaktan alın.  İçini oyup kızarttığınız patateslerin içerisine kavurduğunuz kıymalı harcı ekleyin. Bir fırın tepsisine veya güvecin içerisine patates dolmalarını yerleştirin.  Bir kapta su, salça ve tuzu ekleyip karıştırın.  Bu karışımı patates dolmalarının üzerine gezdirin.  Önceden ısıtılmış 195 derece fırında 35 dakika pişirin. Patates dolmaları hazır, afiyet olsun!

I feel like there music is different for me it's not kpop or pop.. it's BLACKPINK music.. they are my teen love and they inspire me a lot.. being humble and down to earth despite of being this big celebrities.. I am so proud of them..
No one:  Me: MAYBE WE CAN HEAR JISOO SAYING BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA
I don't know why i am getting 2ne1 vibes is it just me or? Nah?
Chaensoo jenlisa ❤❤❤❤❤💜💜💜💜💜💜

soooo excited for tomorrow
Oml I just love the vibe of the song! And the instrumentals? Beyond spectacular!  There is a reason they chose this song to be the MAIN title track of their FIRST full album. This is without any doubt the BEST song that BLACKPINK has released yet.  It's going to be a MASTERPIECE.
I'm an Army but sometimes I'm  also a Blink . *Love Rosé*

Dear fellow BLINKS, there is a chance we might not break as many records this time bc a lot of  BLINKS (like myself) have school on Friday. I won't be able to stay up for the premiere or stream at all for the first 6 1/2 hrs. And then not much for the next 5 -7 hrs since I have classes. Just know that no matter what BLACKPINK deserve our love and support. *p. s.* if you're like me and have school, don't feel bad for not being able to stream that much. I love breaking records but don't prioritize kpop over your education.
I Love Blackpink
I JUST LOVE WITH ALL MY HEAR THAT THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH STAY ERA CONCEPT AND I JUST CANT GET OVER IT LIKE OMG THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SOFT 😔🥺🤧🥰👊
So Excited😊

Why are they people say there coping BTS 🤦🏽‍♀️
Honestly, I know a lot of blinks like me anticipates this comeback however, a lot are also disinterested because it’s not a more of a dance track. Just like Stay,,, let’ work harder for our goals.

These people sometimes amaze us, but on the other hand, they really deserve to be praised, considering that getting an achievement is not easy.  They may have given up a lot of sacrifices to achieve this achievement.  keep up the spirit and always be successful.  I hope you remain a humble person.  always polite.  Blaackpink spirit.  I always support you.  I'm ygstan.  love.

dear ppl of all fandoms, let’s please keep the comment section peaceful and not feed fan wars....they worked hard for this..and if u don’t like the music or the bp, just leave. u don’t have to leave hateful comments.
I sense alot of gay
Do I want Jennie to rap? Yes Do I want more lines for Jisoo? Yes Do I want Lisa to have a dance break and singing lines? Yes Do I want Rosé to have lines that highlight her vocals? Yes Will all of that happen? Maybe or maybe not Will I still steam and appreciate it? Yes  Do I love all members? Yes Do I have a bias and a bias wrecker? Yes but it doesn’t stop me from loving all the members.
JenLisa 😭 ❤️

love plinks 🌈🌈🌈❤💛💚💙💜
Metu me  like BCKPINK, BTS, EXO, twice, tomorrow x together, super Junior, got 7 , seventeen I love  you  💜
LEMBREM-SE:  1: Encham o MV de bons comentários, porque haverão muito spam e vai ser impossível ler um comentário sobre o clipe das meninas.   2. Dêem amor para todas elas, mesmo que umas tenham mais linhas e tela. Lovesick girls é especial, porque a Jennie e a Jisoo participaram da criação.  3. Não precisamos quebrar nenhum record, só precisamos mostrar o nosso amor pelas meninas. O resto é opcional (stream).   4. Vamos dar muito amor, afinal este é o primeiro full álbum em quatro anos.   BLACKPINK é para os BLINKS e os BLINKS são para o BLACKPINK. Fiquem fortes, se alimentem, bebam água e lembrem-se: são apenas números, sendo que o que mais importa é o amor.
Hi i love you blackpik
I'm looking forward to this new sing, our babies are too beautiful, I love you all, wonderful

Black Pink is the first Korean group. I like their voices, but I consider Jisoo to be the queen of Black Pink and I love them all.

OMG
Who expect Jisoo will say : "Blackpink in your area"
Dở
i love you blackpink
IM SO HAPPY THERE ARENT MUCH DISLIKES, BUT IM SO DAMN MAD WHY THERE'S EVEN A DISLIKE BUTTON FOR THIS
Im araby and i am a muslem blak bink i love you so muth.
Dear Lovely/Beautiful/Hardworking BLINKS,  - If JISOO doesn't say BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA : It's OKAY - If JENNIE doesn't RAP : It's OKAY - If ROSÉ doesn't have HIGH NOTES: It's OKAY - If LISA doesn't have a DANCE BREAK : It's OKAY  Remember that this is their FIRST ALBUM (1ST ALBUM) so we have to SUPPORT ALL OF THEM NO MATTER WHAT. ALL OF THEM, with love, have contributed to this album and have worked hard for it. As a return, let's not ruin it for them. Let's not drag other member(s). Let's just PEACEFULLY EMAIL YG ACCOUNTS if we're not satisfied. Lastly, kindly don't stop str3aming just because you are not 'satisfied' with it.  BLINKS ARE MORE STRONGER AND MORE POWERFUL WHEN WE ARE UNITED!!! :-)   Copy and paste this so everyone knows about this.   Note: When copying, change the format (i.e. Font, Arrangement, Words) or add some sentences/phrases so it WON'T BE COUNTED AS SPAM.  THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND COOPERATION! :-)

LISTEN BLINKS   • If Jennie doesn't rap: it's OKAY  • If Jisoo doesn't say blackpink in your area: it's OKAY  • If Rosé doesn't have high notes: it's OKAY  • If Lisa doesn't have a dance break: it's OKAY  • If the line/screen distribution is not fair: It's OKAY  We have to support JENCHULICHAENG NO MATTER WHAT, they worked hard for this album so let's not ruin it for them and also don't stop str3aming just because you are not 'satisfied' with it.    Copy and paste this so everyone knows about this
People say that Blackpink have only Korean fans. Like If you're not Korean
Everyone is supporting single member but who loves all BP members

Turkısh blink   Çırpılmış yumurta tarifi Nasıl yapılır?  Tavanın altını açıp iyice ısıtın.  Yumurtaları derin bir kasede sarısı ve beyazı kaynaşana dek iyice çırpın.  Yumurtalara 1 çay kaşığı tuz ilave edin.  Kremayı yumurtalara ilave edin ve pürüzsüz bir kıvam alana kadar çırpın.  Tereyağını kızgın tavada eritip her tarafa iyice yayın.  Yumurtayı tavaya dökünve altı pişmeye başlayınca kenardan ortaya doğru sıyırarak yumurtayı karıştırın.  Yarım çay kaşığı daha tuz ekleyip yumurtanız iyice pişmeden tavayı ocaktan alın.  Yumurta kendi sıcağıyla biraz daha pişecektir.  Çırpılmış yumurtanızı tavadan alıp üzerine karabiber ve ince kıyılmış taze soğan serpin.  Yanında kızarmış ekmekle sıcacık servis edin. Afiyet olsun…

يا بلينك يوم الجمعه هتنزل اغنيه بلاك بينك الجديده و اتسربت معلومات ان الهيترز عاوزين يوصلو الدس لايك على الاغنيه الجديده للمليار فى وقت قصير جدا احنا لو تعاونا نقدر نقلب ما يتمنوه و نخلى آلاف توصل مليار لايك و هنعمل ده عن طريق الحسابات اعملو حسابات كتير و يوم الخميس هنستعد و نحط لايكات كتيررر و هنعمل ستريم كتير عاوزين خلال اربعه و عشرين ساعه نوصل الفيديو ل 3 مليون مشاهده و خلال اسبوعين توصل 5 مليون و خلال شهر من نزول الاغنيه تكون وصلت للمليار نحن اقوى من الهيترز... الهيترز عاوزين يدمرو بلاك بينك و بتس لكن هم خايفين من البلينك و الارمي و هم بيدخلو و يعملو نفسهم ارمي أو بلينك و يشتمو بلاك بينك أو بتس علشان تحصل حرب بين الارمي و البلينك و يقدرو بعدها يدمرو بلاك بينك و بتس خلونا نتعاون لأننا اكبر مخاوف الهيترز و انشروا الرساله دى علشان توصل ل اكبر عدد من البلينك

Even haters prove that the 19k dislikes are waiting for blackpink's song GO QUEENS🖤🖤🖤
BLINKS,  PLEASE TAKE TIME TO READ THIS!  On October 2, BLACKPINK will release new music, an album, their very first, after years of training and four years of roller coaster journey since they debuted. The long wait, our almost hopeless anticipation, is finally to come end. BLINKS, it is happening and we can only imagine how pricelessly happy and excited Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa to share this special moment with us. So we humbly, desperately ask everyone who holds the girls close to their hearts to set aside your own opinions, feelings and differences during this probably month-long celebration or maybe longer, and give BLACKPINK a peaceful comeback once and for all, well, at least within our fandom. Think things through and choose to celebrate the happiness "THE ALBUM" will bring to the girls and the massive success it is yet to achieve. We, BLINKS, will be the only ones who will make it possible. This first album release will only be as we all expected and wanted it to be if we work together as one. So we are begging you to please not blab and dwell on unequal line distribution and screentime if ever there will be, make-up, outfits, or whatever other reasons that might throw gloom over this joyful occasion. Remember what Jisoo once said, not long ago, in the Twitter Blueroom, "Records isn't the main thing. As long as you are enjoying the song, it is enough for us.." BLACKPINK loves us so much BLINKS. Let's give back the same amount of love or more to BLACKPINK by coming together as a united fandom, whether you are OT4, OT3, OT2, or OT1, we are a Family. Let's just rant when October ends but seriously, there's no need to fight one another. We should have each other's back. Don't be a party pooper arasseo? - Worldwide BLINKS!!
I really love the beat
WHAT? Says long time black pink fans after they realise that they removed the rectangle
Sad song tapi jedag jedug :)
Wishing this will be a successful album. Also please STOP with the fan wars. Y'all making yourselves stressed.

popular opinion: this song will be best song all of time <3

Feel bigbang vibe in this teaser. Gonna love it
Love blackpink
jenlisaa chaesooooo
My girls
can't wait for the video...👑💄
Jennie is so cuteee and pretty
Sometimes I feel BlackPink makes more badass songs than boy groups (not only k pop but worldwide boy groups)  All these  beats, vibes, lyrics, the way Lisa raps are expected from male bands.  And I am telling this as a guy
Blinks be ready we can't let toxic fandoms spoil our queens 1st full Album like they did to Ice Cream.
I think the MV will have many running scene-
Lisa so beautiful
00:15 reminds me of Stairway to Heaven
صلوا على الحبيب المصطفى صلى الله عليه وسلم
Türkler begensin bakalım kaç Türk var +1
Blackpink be feeding us with comebacks T^T
I'm Jisoo I'm ok.

A moment of silence for People who say they can't write their own lyrics..
Ok yg is really supporting Chaesoo and jenlisa🤚😌
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
ok, this is my crazy theory.  I'm pretty sure this could be the continuation so to speak of playin whit fire  Don't you remember that in 'playing whit fire' there is a boy who is dating the pinks?   Well they all fall in love with the less smooth, which ignores him on the bus .. but what if maybe later she fell in love with him but he turned out to be a toxic person and now the four of them have a broken heart.
manong yg release ka ng release ng song nila eh yung album kailan pa PO?
wind flower xD
8.1M
As always the teaser will be totally irrelevant with the M/V.
they will win an oscar here
🔥
Awesome 🥰😍😘
The last number of likes you get will be your claimed song in Blackpink's The Album  1- Lovesick Girls 2- How You Like That 3 - Ice Cream 4 - Bet You Wanna 5 - Pretty Savage 6 - Love To Hate me 7 - Crazy Over You 8 - You Never Know 9 - Lovesick Girls/Pretty Savage 0 - How You Like That/ Bet You Wanna
♡♡♡♡
*BLACKPINK* albums are addictive.  Do you agree?
This reminds me of Little Mix’s Shout out to my ex.
Cant wait
I'm always coming back to this teaser
Wawww
*IMPORTANT* BLINKS please str3m all the songs of THE ALBUM along with the MV. BET YOU WANNA(FT. CARDI B) is FULL ENGLISH rap song. It have the highest probability to get high on billboard and also don't forget to request on the RADIO and Shazam all the songs.
Simps
3 comebacks en un año la quedo
Yeuuuuu
*ENLOQUECE*
Indian blinks and army like here and a request to bp pls come to India
Some people say that blackpink has only American fans. But no one said that...

Tavuk Kapama Tarifi İçin Malzemeler  Tavuklar için:  8 adet tavuk baget  2 litre su  1 çay kaşığı tane karabiber  2 adet defne yaprağı  1/2 adet soğan(küçük boy)  Pilavı için:  4 su bardağı pirinç  2 yemek kaşığı sıvı yağ  2 yemek kaşığı (tepeleme) tereyağı  1 su bardağı pilavlık bulgur  Sosu için:  4 yemek kaşığı yoğurt  1 yemek kaşığı toz kırmızı biber  1 tatlı kaşığı tuz  3 yemek kaşığı sıvı yağ  Fırın tepsisine eklemek için:  9 çay kaşığı tereyağı  1 litre tavuk suyu(tavukları haşladığınız sudan)  Tavuk Kapama Tarifinin Püf Noktası  Verilen malzeme ölçüleri 40 santimetre çapında sığ fırın tepsisi içindir. Daha küçük bir tepsi kullanacaksanız, ölçüleri ve fırında pişme süresini adapte etmeniz önerilir.  Tavuk Kapama Tarifinin Pişirme Önerisi  Eğer tavuklarınızın biraz daha kızarmasını isterseniz 180 derecede 10 dakika daha pişirebilirsiniz.  Tavuk Kapama Tarifi Nasıl Yapılır?  Tavukları bir tencereye yerleştirin ve üzerine suyu ekleyin. ￼  Karabiber, defne yaprağı ve soğanı da ekledikten sonra kısık-orta ateşte pişmeye bırakın. Tavukların içi pişinceye dek haşlayın. ￼  Pilavını hazırlamak için bir tavaya sıvıyağ ve tereyağını koyarak ısıtın. ￼  Suda bekletmiş olduğunuz pirinçleri süzdükten sonra tavaya ekleyin. ￼  Bulguru ve tuzunu da ekledikten sonra güzelce karıştırıp hafifçe kavurun. ￼  Haşladığınız tavukları tencereden alın. Tavuk suyunu daha sonra fırına verirken kullanmak üzere süzün ve kenara ayırın. ￼  Tavukların üzerine süreceğiniz sosu hazırlamak için bir kasede yoğurt, toz kırmızı biber, tuz ve sıvı yağı karıştırın. ￼  40 santimere çapındaki tepsiye kavurduğunuz pilav harcını dökün ve üzerini düzelterek eşit bir şekilde yayın. Haşlanmış tavuk bagetleri üzerine güzelce dizin. ￼  Bir fırçayla hazırladığınız sosu tavukların üzerine sürün. ￼  Haşladığınız tavukların suyundan 1 litre tepsiye dökün. Pilavın üstünü hafifçe geçecek kadar dökmeniz de yeterli olacaktır.Tavukların aralarına gelecek şekilde tereyağını serpiştirin. ￼  Ortasını kestiğiniz yağlı kağıdı tepsinin üzerine yerleştirin. ￼  200 derece fırında 40 dakika kadar pişirin. Sıcak servis edin, afiyetler olsun. ￼

BLINKS! The TEASER of the new Pink song, LOVESICK GIRLS, has just been uploaded. Our goal is 20 million visits in 24 hours. Come on!! The views are frozen, but that's okay, it's not because of the spam or the emojis, it's because there are a lot of people watching and that's great.

soo when is the peformance ice cream comin out not animated
I LOVE THEEM
Mi teoria es que las 4 chicas están pasando por relaciones tóxicas y por eso se les ve "melancólicas" y pienso que entre ellas se van a ayudar a salir de sus relaciones, y por eso al final salen juntas y contentas.
Who come here because teaser mv out now
I'm not a blink but I love this so muchhh

I can't believe that even haters can't wait for their comeback
مرحبا
Wow nice
Jisoo Speak Blackpink in your área
Please just accept whatever happens! don't send hate to the girls if you don't get what you want cuz you set your own expectations high don't ruin the comeback like last time. They worked hard on this album.  Who gets to rap depends on how the producers want to portrait mood and tone of the song.  If they want a fast, fierce, fire-spitting boss bish vibe, Jennie is the one. If they want a swagger, smooth flow bars, then it’s Lisa thing.  Toxic fans on social media need to stop being so obsessed with members’ role and let the professionals do their thing.  Please blinks, support all members, stream properly, buy the album and just have fun!! As long as we get a comeback, we should be thankful at least.  On the day we should trend "Let's have a peaceful comeback"
BEST GROUP IN THE WORLD
SHES GORGEOUS

So hot
This song is gonna be a LEGEND
( يُؤتِكُم خيرًا مما أُخِذ منكم ) لطالما جاء عوَض الله غزيرًا، كريمًا، يُنسِيك كل مرارة تذوقتها في تفاصيل حياتك ، يأتيك كمكافأة على صبرك وتجلّدك، هو لا ينسى أمنياتك التي سكنت فؤادك، قد يؤجّلها قليلا لتنمو بصورة أكمَل وأجمل، حتى إذا جاءتك جاءت مبهرة، تغمرك بالسرور والسعاده
في لغة الأرض والحساب البشري وعقول العجلين كل شيء انتهى، فلم يعد هناك سبيل للخلاص! وفي لغة الموحدين المتوكلين الصادقين ((كلا إنَّ معي ربي سيهدين)).
I love BLACKPINK
Ojalá Jisoo diga “BLACKPINK IN YOUR ÁREA” ;D
queens of everything
I love blacpinkk Gracias por existir 😍😁😁😁😁😁😁😚
i love black pink
They look so amazing and I am I the only one who thinks this radiates teamwork vibes? I don't know why it seems like they ran away from home to do something together like the theme looks so- very different from their old ones. We can finally see what the members can really do :)
Hayat bazen çok zor oluyor
Having #JENLISA concept plus #Chaesoo such a wonderful blessing to us Thankyou so much!!!!!! @ygofficial we honored you and continue supporting you. ❤️ this has been a big gift!! I love you FOREVER BLACKPINK.

Soğanı rendeleyin fazla suyunu süzün. 3. Tüm malzemeleri karıştırın. 4. Hazırladığınız harcı buzdolabında yarım saat 1 saat kadar bekletin.  5. Şişleri ıslatın. 6. Elinizle harçtan alarak şişe dizin. 7. 200 derecede pişirin. Fırın tepsisine dizerken altına isterseniz biber patates koyabilirsiniz. 8. Köftenin yağıyla çok güzel pişiyor.

Dear parents, just because your child is smiling at their phone doesn't  mean they have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they are just looking at Lisa  with blonde hair.

People Say BLACKPINK only has American fans  Like if You're not American
Blinks even if Jennie doesn't get to rap, Jisoo doesn't get to say 'Blackpink in your area' , Rosé does get the high notes  or Lisa doesn't get a dance break , we'll still have to support them. Our girls have worked very hard on this album and we have to make them happy. So please keep supporting these girls no matter what happens. CREDITS TO THEIR OWNER
