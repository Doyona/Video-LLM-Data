Josh and Harry were the original Moiz and Sami
Harry's got those autistic power senses
this explains viks brain damage 🤣
I beg make some more  content like this
Hi everybody
VIK you were in the chair for like 20 turns
2:26 it would be so funny if they just ended it there😂
This is the funniest video I’ve watched in a while
The entire video is just JJ going–🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Vikkkk😭😭😭
Vik got slapped like 2 min on his head that gotta do some damage to his fragile head or neck 😂
JJ : 🐔🐓🐓🐔🐔
More of this
7:08 The way Josh slapped Simon made me laugh so hard
7:28 Nah jjs laugh be the laugh u get mad at
0:15 vic abuse😂 2:27
8:37 just so I can come back and watch this moment again and again
look at BEZ FACE
Video?
7:30 and 8:35 are just way too funny bro it kills me😹😹
Vik getting it wrong with JJ holding and shaking his hand in pain is top tier
2:15 jj's laugh sounded like the producer tag when the door opens after "ayo pierre u wanna come out ere"
😂😂😂😂😂
CRYINGGG
8:39 😂😂😂😂😂
Its Vik always turning to the wrong side for ,e LOL
1/5th of this video is vikkstar being smacked on the head… mental
5:27 Although Ethan was sorry, there was probably also something else that gave his position away. Josh looked at him.
why did they let Vik go first lol, they set him up! 🤣
Nah this is just vik getting bullied
Ring this version back plz.
CTE unlocked..🤣😂
I love the dichotomoy between the XIX chain intro and then nearly 10 minutes of purposefully 7 idiots slapping their heads as a game
Me waking up in the middle of the night to get something to eat:  My door making the loudest noise known to mand kind 7:30 :
8:18 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ethan slap is the best
This video is funny
One of the most underrated sidemen videos as a whole ever. I never thought i would laugh at 7 guys smacking each other on the head for 10 minutes but Vik's turns killed me😂😅
I could watch them do this for hours it’s so funny 😂
6:04 Tea’s ready
7:01 Damn Ethan 😂
7:08 The slap 😂
Jj laugh man 😂🫵
Who's here after the Inflatables one?
seeing this video again after they just posted this video again is insane
Who’s here back to watch this banger after the noodles video
2025🗿
#stopvikkabuse
2 years later and still one of the funniest videos I have ever watched. It gets funnier each time I watch it too. Should run this one back in 2025!
2:15
2:13
2:14 JJ laugh
i wonder why they haven't done this vid since. it got hella views, they were all laughing hard the whole time. i cant imagine it hurts very much either, maybe theyre saving it
9:07
stop vik abuse/j
JJ looks like he belongs in a demented hospital
Probably my most replayed sidemen video lmao
WE NEED THIS BACK!!!!!!!!
I think jj forehead is getting bigger lads he needs a new bandana
Kai shoulda done this 💀
4:41 JJ told Simon with his eyes that it was Harry
i like how this devolved from slaps to just trying to break each other's necks as revenge 😭😭
Ethen’s face has me dying at 5:27
2:14 jj’s laugh😂😂
Them laughing sounds like strangling a bunch of rubber chickens.
KSI had to cover up his mountain (forehead) with a bandana to avoid blinding the whole world even then!
KSI laugh had me crying the whole video 😂😂🤣
What’s the vid called ?
Ksi laugh sould be the best alarm in century .
I played this same Game when u was in 9th Class/Grade with my Friends during the Periods with Substitue teacher or Volunteers,
I bet I haven't laughed this hard in years man 😂
Tobi wouldn’t hit vic hard
Going back to this video and Vik only has 2 slaps in total in which his 2nd slap gets called out 😭😭😭😭
8:39 has to be one of the best sidemen moments ever
Ksi’s laugh tho 7:29
We need more of this pls 😂
3:00 3:14 5:14 5:26 6:13 6:32
It was so wholesome seeing simon saying well done to vikk at the end💜
5:55 vikk slap the best
2:30 I love how Ethan checks on Vik to see if he’s alright
I neeeeeeed a new one of these please
who here in 2024 about to be 2025
Shut up KSI it's not even that funnier
Did vik hit ince in this
#stopvikkabuse
Ok now do this but no laugh challenge who ever laugh gets a punishment😂
Bring it back 😂😂😂😂
this game is to be played with friends. not with known people from youtube who you work with. -_-
PART 2🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do this again
7:08 😂
no way this was 2 years ago
Bro the helmet on Josh's head is like a baby wearing that equipement which shapes their head during early stages lol
This was pretty enjoyable
Vikki slapped once and was caught instantly
Vik😅❤
2 years later and this is still so funny
Version 2 with more people and getting blindfolded
😂😂
Just bullish Vik again 😂☠️☠️
We used to play this game all the time in the field. Really one of my favorites of all time. Getting your whole team together and doing this made for the best laughs. But military helmets definitely don’t give the same protection. Hilarious video.
i havent laughed this hard in so long
Sidemen always made my day better..... the only OGs of YOUTUBE💪
Need part 2
Helmet Boy Origins, Mate!!
They just enjoyed hitting vik abit too much and too hard.
Ethan's face at 5:27 falls apart after hitting🤣
We need helmet game 2.0! and slipper game 2.0!!!
no doubt funniest moresidemn vid
8:39 this made me WHEEZE
their laugh is too contagious
4:43 Ethan was feeling a bit itchy
Ethan was hard😭😭
8:38 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo do this again 😭😭😭🤣
6:38 OOF 😂
4:14 Bro did it with agression 😂
5:25 this moment was just hilarious easily one of my fav sidemen vids seeing them all genuinely laughing and smiling
This was the best one I’ve watched in a while since the egg one 😂😂😂
Vik please participate
How did we never get another one of these?
This is the only vid I could watch over and over again and still laugh at the same moments everytime😭😭
KSI sounds like a deflating balloon
JJ’s laugh Is to funny 😂
why am i laughing to only JJ?? 😂😂😂
KSI made this
We need this in 2024
This video is so underrated! It always makes me laugh, i love it so much!

https://youtu.be/tZJBbxUAjKY?si=3R_nzk6u_wtl3CGk
It’s a 9 minute video Vik was there for 2 minutes of the video

ksi laugh like Elmo doll
4:41 scratching look at ethan
2:13 iconic jj laugh
AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaa
2:14 is the carti tag
Never thought I would laugh this hard 😂
Vik was bad figuring out what direction the slaps/kick come from
Nah bro after that vik needs a hug bro
This make me laugh and I needed it please do this again
the first guy took 2 mins and 30 secs to finally get it great vid
Call me crazy, but wasn’t it set in a different location?
Vikk needs to step up his game. All i see is bullying.
2:15 my door opening
5:40
Didn't realise Josh's head was that big😂
Alternative title - bullying vik for 8mins straight ☠️
Make a part 3
Alcahaal
2:19 vik only guesses tobi bc he's nice compared to the rest of the lot
2:11 put it in 25 playback speed 😂😂
😭😭
Bro i was using airpods and listening to ksi laugh for 9 min was a nightmare💀
9 months later, time for me to say it needs a oart 2 AGAIN!
Watch vik get slapped for the first 2:30 of the video
LMAOOOO I CANT WITH JJ

Watching this in 2024 and honestly one of the funniest videos! 😂😂😂
This was 2 years ago damn😭 .
JJs laugh is just wow
Y'all should remake the thumbnail to vik sitting there😂😂😂
We need a part respectably
I love how they start off with small hits then gradually build up to the bigger hits lol 😂
It was not a good idea to eat while watching this video, almost chocked on the food laughing. Had me drooling ngl 🤣
Bro this is two years old
They need to redo this!
😂😂😂😂 still wish they’d do this again with guests 😅😅
2 years later and it still makes me cry of laughter
We need a part 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 so much more of this
need to make more of these, oh my I haven’t laughed this hard watching a Sidemen video in a while
Like If you’re still watching this in 2024! This needs to be done again! The simplest funniest thing ever! Petition for a part 2!!!!!
this was just a vid of Vik getting tossed around by the other Sidemen 🤣
2 years later we need a pt.2 plz
Yo bro i died laughing af
they need to do this again mannn
9:12 tobi on the floor
why is this the funniest thing ive seen all day
Every time I watch this video I am just laughing all around 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro I need a round 2, that was the most/hardest ive laughed over the span of 9 minutes
JJ was having the best time of is life in this vid
The greatest more sidemen video ever....excluding among us/GTA
We do this at school but without helmets
The time which JJ slaps VIK and sounds like TOM the cartoon 😂😂😂
2:06
anying lucu bgtt😂😭😭
I can't stand just laugh pure enjoyment
8:19 MAN GOT PUNTED 😂😂
Everytime I need a good laugh I come back to this video, this genuinely  might be one of the funniest videos they’ve ever filmed

Lmao the Boyz got Vick right where they want him 😂
The funniest video I have ever watched cannot stop laughing
5:30 Is it just me is or does Ethan low-key look like Paul smith (the comedian)
I cant watch their girl taps ffs make him wana get it rivht girl slaps harder your men u want it to hurt lol
we play this but without the helmet😂
Vik got brain damage
All the muscles in my throat are screaming in pain from LAUGHING so hard
Hii
Yo Pierre you wanna come out here? 2:15
Vik is so slow 😂
Vicsiter never do it again until the last part bro was getting bullied
I cannot believe I just subscribed to a channel where for 9 minutes straight men slapped each other silly....... Keep going
Do this again @MoreSidemen
vyaaa hyaaa hyaa hyaa hyaa hyaaa
Funny how vik only slapped twice after taking so many hits lol. He was like - nah bruh I'm good
It keeps getting funnier everytime I watch this
6:42
2:13 😂
Part two of this is needed 🤣🤣🤣
4:14 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the noise tobi made
3:48 😂
Jj didnt get his turn!
JJ regular show ahh laugh, muscle man ahh laugh
Harry kicking vik 😂
It’s gonna be 2 years and they have yet to make another one of this 🥺 I bet this will do way better on the sidemen channel too ahha
Ethan trying to contain his laughter is absolute comedy 😂😂
The sidemen bully vik for the first 2 minutes
I come back too this every once in a while still gets me everytime
This is what we need every year!! This video is a banger!!
Get done Harry and nice one Simon
Fuking laughed to death😂😂
Make another one! One of the only good more sidemen vids!!
The way JJ be laughing bro😂😂 sounds like a constipated squirrel
the fact i’ve come back to watch this is insane
I remember playing this in school, except your head is on a table, and you have no helmet
who else thinks we need a part 2?
Josh should really not be allowed  hahahahahah
The helmet on Josh’s head was the comedy for me
we need a helmet game 2
The edit at 0:53 kills me every time i watch this video 😂😂😂😂and jj saying "here it begins"😆 when vik sat in the chair the second time 8:29 8:29
It just give a headache 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This shit ain’t funny they all laugh the same
Vik was waiting for right time 😂
Viks inability to figure out who it was actually made me angry and I don’t know why 😭😭
JJ was the only one who went once.
When someone asks if you have slapstick humor
Vikk just quit the game after his round
Me and my Friends play this just without the Helmets
Harry has 6th sense 😂
In first round ksi is dying
legit tobi is so nice lol everyone knows when he hits you
Poor vik😢😂
MORE OF THIS PLS I BEG
8:19 Harry's kick was personal 😂😂
#Stopabusingvik 😂
JJ *gets touched * Starts giggling
This video never fails to make me laugh 😭😭
Stop bullying vik..😅🤣
We need part 2 😡it’s been a year already
لعبه صلح بقي اسمها هيلمت جيم 😂
This was so funny and so simple
thanks for the best 9 minutes of my life 😂
for me this is a peak sidemen video. top 3 in my sidemen video tier list
Fooookin Elmet boi m88888, can’t feel the shlaps cuz I got me fookin lucky elmet on m88888
First time i realize josh is powerful 😂
Need another one
this is the kind of game me and the homies would play after our famous “paper kiss challenge”
The whole time I was wondering what shoes Simon was wearing.
THIS WAS A YEAR AGO WHAT
vik is the cutest person ever
😂😂😂😂 this is soooo funny 🤣
2:13 JJ being a deflating balloon when he laughs like always.
Poor vik 😂😂😂😂
I have come back to this yet again😂😂 also "Yo Pierre, wanna come out here?" 2:13
Just a bunch of grown men smaking the everlasting life out of each other 😂😂😂😂
this should be done as a silent library
KSI MADE ME SPIT MY WATER 💀💀💀
The fact that we are all watching full grown men hit eachother is hilarious
8:20 foot
8:18 proves that Harry has childish humor 😂
The richest guy in sidemen vik is getting abused
this is giving old sideman and i’m here for it
Poor Vik, got brutalized for two whole minutes 🤣
some say they're still slapping each other to this day - emcee said this
This might be the funniest Sidemen video tbh
Please another one
4:14 5:08 5:13 5:26 5:56 6:24 6:38 7:00 7:08 7:45 8:37 9:05
5:25 was so funny cause Ethan’s trying to hold back the pain and josh is looking at him laughing 😂
Bro jj looks like a bully when he slaps vick
JJ's laugh just makes it 100000000x better bro😂
Vikstar man of the match for sure😅
The sidemen is so funny
8:37 is so funny n cute i love jj
Still the funniest video they have ever done🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My cheeks hurt from laughing😂😂
we lways need a bunch of 30 year olds hitting each other in the head for fun
After watching this almost 100 times, I cannot fathom how Vik on the last round didn’t see JJ holding his hand in pain 😅
1:00:00
Bro but they hit like girls XD
Please do another one of these 😂😂😂😂
Cancel jk typing for life
The reason their all laughing is because the braincells are bring knocked out of their fucking head😂😂😂😂
2:13 that laugh
Ethan’s face at 5:29 is priceless😂
Surprised there is no part 2😢
1 year later still pissen me self
Vik only hit twice 😂😂
Most underrated sidemen video
Can we get a part 2 to this?
Josh was really letting Viki have it oh my goddd
The sidemen are so funny on YouTube but I   like the sidemen music two of them
Where did  the sidemen get the  helmet 🤔
Nah can we talk about simons shoes
I just before I watched this I went for a wee and I just wet myself watching this
We need a part 2
time for part 2 guys... been a while
I love how Vik struggles for nearly majority of the vid and then everyone else guesses right in a minute or less
8:58 vik’s pov: can I leave sidemen?
Bring it back!!!
The sidemen  they  are  very funny  guy
Underrated video. Did not expect to laugh that much🤣🤣🤣
Did vik have a spelling bee moment and said “nah this will be easy, I’ll go first and get it first try” (SpongeBob time voice) 2 minutes and 30 seconds later
Stop vik abuse
The whole video it’s just Jj going 🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛
JJ had some fun, made me had fun 😂
Simple but funniest video till today 😂
Best game ever
WE NEED MORE OF THIS PLEAAAAASE
ETHANS FACE AT 5:28 😭😭
Goated video
15 months later and im still laughin like a crackhead 😂😂😂
Guess accuracy  Vik- 2/24  Tobi-2/5  Ethan- 2/9  Simon- 2/3  Harry- 2/8  Josh- 2/9  KSI- 1/2
Bro i almost pissed myself laughing i am in a library
8:48 did simon say the n word
This game was made by Egypt, In the 1992, and it wasnt made by sidemen just noti
This is so funny
started with vik being bullied and ended with vik being bullied
JJ genuinely loves violence 😂
They smack like wussies
Forgot how funny these kind of videos are, we need more new ones of these! just stupid fun and thats it, no YouTube algorithm to worry about
Need more of these videos.
This video: obnoxious laughter aggressive pats and pointing
Jj was dying the entire time 😂😂
JJ laugh lol
Title rename “ schoolboys bullying their Indian classmate”
2:14 JJ'S LAUGHH😂😂
Oh poor vik, lmao
Why is this video so funnny😂😂😂😂😂😂
After watching this to many times to count, we need to push the sidemen into making a second!
I think vik hit the others guys about 4 times
Vik got violated 🤣🤣
We need this again
Laughed my ass off a year ago when it first came out just rewatched it and still laughed my ass of please do this one again sometime guys this always bring me to tears it's too funny
I couldn't breath when jj was laughing like a race car just going past a person 🏎🏎🏎🏎
Please do another one of these, this has made my night lmao
Can’t believe this is over a year old
8:44 vik is so dumb 😂😂
Man Vik is so stupid yohh😂😂😂
how in tf was this already a year ago
Vik is so bad at this lmao
Honestly the single dumbest game to ever exist, that being said I’ve played it 3 weekends in a row now 😅
We played this at school but with no helmet and with a large coke plastic bottle
When Vikk doesn't want to sit back in the seat do he just doesn't slap anyone for a while lol
This is so funny.
Vik seeing stars
It’s just that everyone has a contagious laugh 😂 😂😂😂
8:35 was hands down the funniest part when JJ hurt himself slapping a bit too hard 😂😭
6 guys and a tiny asian 😂😂😂
I feel so bad for vik 🙈
Bro JJ’s laugh
Really thought after a min that vic was going to get slapped for the whole 9 mins 😂😂😂
Not the 1st time British dominating indians😂
Petition to rename this to Vic abuse-ment
2.5 min of vik being extra stupid 😂
im fucking crying 😂😂🤣😭😭😭😭😭
That so funny  when Harry just slap Tobi 😂🤣
Funniest sidemen vid of all time.
I'm glad I clicked on this video🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😅🤣🤣😂🤣😂
damn, JJ looks MAD HOT with his hair down, bare fire hoodie man, needs to do it more often
Stop vik abuse
They should have replaced all the sound with hehahdhehdshe
fucking helmet boy
For two and a half minutes of Vic’s suffering I was crying in laughter 😂
They should do this in a library😂😂😂😂
vik is kinda cute cause he did his first slap at 5:56 and his reaction was so cute
This is giving silent library 😂
Need another one of these
welcome to season 2  of VIK'S ABUSE
5:25, 7:10,
Could have Vik 2 guesses
Ek toh ye bhencho rummy wale
It would have been more fun if they refuse to accept and kept going
You now what? u should have a better version of the game: Sidemen Drunk Helmet Game This should be fun I guess =)))))
it still feels like this came out a couple months ago
Not even kidding, I genuinely had to take my asthma inhaler
9:04 That looked like it had precision and technique lol. Josh was mostly stationary allowing most potential energy to convert to kinetic energy of the hit
8:30 Consecutive hits looked like it would HURT. If Josh hit hard after JJ Vikk would have gotten a personality change
8:38 After this hit, surely vikk must have taken temporary brain damage and got light headed. Hit from top I'd worst possible cause it's the only one where helmet and body don't move much and it was true damage lol
8:38 After this hit, surely vikk must have taken temporary brain damage and got light headed.
Ethan's hit at 8:29 turned Vikk's body
From 7:00 Those two hits were one of the hardest hits. Josh hits HARD
2:23 As always Tobi being nice and tapping lightly so Vikk can get out.
Screw among us and gta on this channel. This is my favourite Sidemen video.
Vikk got the worst lol
https://youtu.be/WzHzd4o69jo
So funny
Bring this back lol
8:33 we will never forget
Josh did to Vik what I imagine everyone wants to do. Slam him in the back of his stupid head hard af
How has it already been a year since this video was posted
it would be funny if dem niggas would hit hard asf
pt two with guests
#stopvikkabuse
I watch this every day, just to see these ***** hit each other.. Especially like seeing them hit vik
This video is #bulkyvikstar123 🤣
We need a part 2 of this
This was was flipping hilarious.. You guys should do this once a month.. Had me rolling in laughter.. Was soo fun watching Vik get absolutely smacked sidewards
Poor Vik...
Omg my cheeks r fuckin achin I’m dyin tho 🤣🤣
Everyone there for jj 😂 bruh logan getting tilted when he trying to promote himself as the biggest podcast there is - btw he dont have the biggest podcast
8:38 JJ is over here crying 💀
The best video ever
I can't believe I've never seen this video until now ! Poor Viky :(
Y’all have brought back my British YouTuber faze
Most stupid and simple sidemen content ever... But still funny
Good old harold lmfao😂😂😂 8:19
This is just laughing the entire time. It’s the funniest shit I’ve ever watched
In Romania we play this game without the helmet 🤣🤣🤣 and when we was 13 years old 🤣🤣🤣
Video title bullying vik and laughing
What is the name of that beat in the beginning
Funniest MoreSidemen video 110%

Honestly the first guy was so beaten up, he never moved his hand again just to avoid getting on the seat again
JJ HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHahahahaaaaaaaauaaaaa
The least effort yet the most fun. I love these guys
I am laughing so hard my stomach hurts 🤣
They should do part 2 of this 😂😂😂
bro this a asian game but without the helme btw cant stop laughing
8:38 bro I've been shitting myself at this for half an hour and I can't stop 💀💀
Ksi
ive watched this 10 times and i still laugh
JJ's laugh just cracks me up all the time 😂😂😂
This is too funny
Poor vik man
Vikk didn't even try to hit after his round, didn't even want to go near that chair again😂
3:38. JJ: *Smacks Josh* Josh: *Points at JJ* JJ: "Aw shit!" 🤣🤣🤣
This video is soo funny man🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
KSI laugh is no joke
Ksi fucking dying
One of the greatest vids ever!
We need a part 2!
How long did the hiccups last  THE SIDEMEN around 4 days
Don’t know why but one of the funniest sidemen vid ever 😂
Why do none of the sidemen do cameos?
Vik’s Slaps: 2
I swear Ksi is dying at the end🤣🤣
Just seeing vic nailed ethan with that heritage slap was fantastic 😂💙
The amount of times I have watched this video where 6 grown up men are slapping their mate’s head, is concerning
Is it just me, or am I the only one who enjoys watching Vik get hurt?
The way they turn so quick gets me 💀😭
You know it’s Harry when he can’t contain his huge grin 😭
This is so stupid it's hilarious
10 months later still cracks me up
This is the funniest video y’all have ever made and it’s not even close
alternative title: Sidemen laugh while slapping the crap out of each other for 10 minutes straight💀
9:08 THE WAY TOBI JUST FELL 💀💀
Vik didnt slap anyone
British men beating an Indian. Typical.
Was laughing the whole way through. Absolutely hilarious hahahaha
Pleaseee make another one of these 🤣
6 minutes of vik abuse, love it lmfao
3:15
It's an Indian game😁😁😁😁
This is my most favourite Sidemen video❤️🤣🔥
Do one instead of using a helmet u blind fold them and slap them with fish

im okay 👍 thanks for four minutes
Is it just me or are they laughing like mickey mouse
I never knew watching people slap eachother would be so funny. This is entertainment that literally involved no money
Funniest video ever
Drinking coffee while watching this was a huge mistake.
The way JJs laugh makes this whole video better
Should have used slippers instead of hand. It would have been more funnier 😆
Lmfao 8:49 😂 fucking KSI’s laugh is too funny
8 MONTHS AGO HUH
Damn, I feel bad for Vik.😅😅
This is Jokes!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯

Jj just laughing for ages 😂
Man my cheeks started to hurt half way through the video 😭😭
Just watched sidemen banging theirselves on the head and laughing the entire time for 10 minutes🤣
Vikk only hit once and they guessed it was him.
Non stop laughing though out the whole video 😂😂😂
Funny how they try to destroy something that dosent exist between their ears
I CANT BREATHE
Fuck silent library,hide and seek this is the best most funniest shit i've ever watched🤣🤣
This video must be call « Love to Hurt vikstar »
Not a single minute where I stopped laughing my lungs off 😂😂😂😂💀💀😂😂

This reminds me of the old days man. Just like the old videos simple idea but so much fun.
Please do this again
I’m crying
it's crazy how Vik is good at video games but his perception is shit in this game 😂
This video was more entertaining than the lasy sidemensunday vids
That one laugh that sounded like someone crying got laughing
That kick was pure execution
We need moreee of theseee
Ha ha HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I feel like the plan for this video was just them texting each other like "yeah let's just fucking slap each other" and it ended up becoming a reality
8:38
:)
This was an amazing video we need to see another one of these videos I was dying laughing the entire time
LMAO MORE
More of this 😂😂😂
#stopvikabuse
we already doing it in egypt but with out a helmet LOL
So they did record the 100k vid here, i knew it when i first saw this vid when it came out
The way JJ was shaking his hand in pain, then Simone is laughing at him and Vik still didn't say his name 😂😂
The Sidemen’s best video is less than 10 minutes and on More Sidemen
Ethan suits the helmet

We love vikk abuse from the inside. 😂😂😂
ThiSS iS ViKk aBuSMenT

This reminds me of the moo off days
I'm not even gonna lie, at the beginning of the entire channel when it was made, I didn't like anyone here but after a long time, u guys have been one of my personal favorites

Vik: gets hit Also Vik: "It's Josh"
"Helmet boi origins mate"- vik
You should pick jj because he's laughing so hard hahahahahahahaha
Ethan hits different 😭
this is genuinly the best game no cap
Half the video was just them beating on Vik😂😂
already came back to rewatch this video and the look ethan gives harry at 5:25 is one of the funniest things ive ever seen
With the sidemen chain how do I claim it? I have a side+ acct but idk how to  Ah nvm it's not out yet lol
Damn, it doest felt like 10 minutes😭
The simplicity of this video we need more non stop laughter 😅😅😅😅😅
I laughed so damn hard 😭😭😭😭
7:07 Watch this on 1.75 speed ksi laugh🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just dont understand how JJ did not get busted on end. He allmost broke his hand😂😂😂😂
low budget = fun video🤣🤣🤣🤣
Played this game without the helmet and it was so funny yet so painful at the same time
OK so "kauwa udd bauwa udd" helmet edition.
I luv how Vikk felt so bullied
Poor Vik. He got hit the most and only gave 2 slaps. #stopbullyingvik
Literally the best video ever
I’m crying
Only time we allow #vikabuse lmao
An SDMN punishment pack would be fun
8:38
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
On Balkan you are playing this w/o helmet.

The fact that I heard more laughter than words from this video makes me die

For the past more than 20 years I have never given permission to any ‘show’. I have never signed anything. They are all false pretence. Whoever streamed or stream anything of us, they are criminals and hackers and evils. Please report them to the London police. Ping
4:29哇靠
Got to do another one of these
Stress reliever 🤣🤣🤣
This is my 3rd time watching this and its still funny
6:39 Ayo watch vikks eyeballs expand man😂💀
After the injuries Vik sustained in this video, he's no longer the smartest sidemen
Ethan always looks so guilty when he does it
Ethans trim and fit was sick ngl
7:07 that slap was legendary
Ay Josh's head is massive bro
I will take this as the new annual moo off please
Feel like this is the next hide n seek/mukbang. Low effort but everyone loves it
this challenge in silent library would SLAP!!!
KSI 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vic finally realised after 20 slaps in the head that logic an intelligence aint gonna help in this game
It’s just a video you can come back to every few days we need another 😂
Poor Vikk i lauged way to much at this vid 😂
How tf is this so funny 😂
We Need More of that
I love vik bro 😂 seriously everyone likes him ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wanted bio to act like he fell out the chair and was unconscious lol I would of love to set ehirreactiom
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is why girls live longer
3,527,688 views
Broo it's the 3rd time watching this video😂😂😂
This is just an excuse for vikkabuse m8
This was jokes 💀😂
4:40 Ethan again
anybody that mentions jj's hairline needs to leave asap
Can I sue the Sidemen for giving me an asthma attack from laughing cause this shit was too fucking good
8:48 Simon saying the N-word???
Do it without the helmant
Absolutely amazing! 🤯😂
FUNNIEST video I’ve watched in 2022 so far!!! 😂
Anyone here after seeing it on titok?😅
This vid is incredible
8:37 it's like jj pressed a button to make him laugh 😂😂😂
I think Tobi deliberately niced Vikk at the start cos he felt bad that Vikk was struggling to guess. Good guy tobi strikes again
The way vik turns around and stares is so fucking funny lmfao
"Wear it and sit"
free vik
jj's rule is that you can bully vik if he's wearing a helmet
vik was getting abused at the end🤣🤣
Yo this is so simple but so so funny
Vikk got bullied.!
2:14
Never cried like this in a while
On a study break from studying for exams and im crying with laughter thank you so much😭😭
Part 2!!!!!
Kept me laughing the WHOLE FUCKING VIDEO. Love you #Sidemen
#stopvikviolation
wtf did i just watch and why am i crying of laughter
this shit got my  whole train staring at me like a weirdo because i’m dying 😭
I think I was crying at one point 😂😂😂😂
This game makes no fucking sense🤣
8:48 simon said the n word bruh
Mad
i feel like they just bullied vik the whole time it was so funny
I thought vikk was smart
Waiting for part 2..😍😍
It's trending at our school now.
im rolling straight tears so funny
Please do more of this! I just laughed so hard lol 😆
This is elite
Simon- Reach Ethan- Sudden Tobi - Light Josh - pain JJ - power Harry - Innovator Vik - avenger
Imagine trying to recognize body language and slap patterns based on speed, power, and location while having your head be subject to the stress of the game
#DONTBULLYVIK
them boys love smacking there helmet.
this video is just 7 grown  men smacking each others head for 9 minutes and its amazing
I watched this high and laughed at it for an hour straight
the premise is so simple yet it's SO FUCKING FUNNY, i could honestly watch this go on for hours. Better yet turn this game into a tournament like the annual moo off.
Their laughs are contagious 💀
the lack of talking sends me over the edge
Bro did Simon say my n word at 8 min 48 seconds?!
5:26 had me in stitches! 🤣 🤣 🤣
Allow it! 🤣🤣
. COOL!!! But HIT like a MAN!!!!!!!!!
6:39 the sound effect makes it 1000x better 😂
5:28 Ethan’s face
Finally a quick ultimate offline game that perfect for the boys. Only a single helmet and a chair required to have fun.  Bring back more of this type of game! Just like the good old days!
The way Toni just falls💀
Ethan was having a good grope at 4:40
I’ve in god never laughed so long in my life
the funniest bit of this video was vikk gessing josh with JJ notably shaking his hand after hitting the helmet too hard
Vik was So close but so far😂
I just heard 9 minutes and 46 seconds of them laughing and I loved it
Vikk ruining another video. shock!
thats viks villain arc
We do it without the helmet
South africans know this as suck jou pet
Alternate title: 9 minutes if contagious laughter
4:40 see ethan
7:08 best one 🤣🤣🤣
KSI strategy: hit and laugh louder
Funny how the slaps just get harder and harder...
I want a 20 min version of this.
Holly nearly pissed myself when vik was doing it🤣🤣
KSI hand was shaking why didn't Vick choose him...
rooney scholes amaral pjanic batshuayi muslera salah :))))))
Anyone else who thinks JJ looks like the black calthedragon
this was one of the funniest funking videos ive seen. grown men slapping each other on the head and guessing who did it. mad.
Its fun until you take the helmet
I think it was Tokumi who started this trend, they're from the philippines about 5m sub.
4:40 jj is a snitch
5:25 Ethan’s face 💀
3,390,328 views
Vik got hit so hard forgot how to play the game. Then when he finally hit he got caught 💀
It’s the sidemen moo off all over again
Helmet game part 2?
#stopbullyingVikstar
One of the funniest videos Ive wacthed
Ksimon cheated at 4:41 JJ looked at Harry to tell Simon it was him the maggot with an F
harry kick vik was so funny omg 🤣🤣🤣
I cannot unhear the Iron man lasers XDXD
Imagine if this was a silent library challenge
LMAO POOR VIK
the way vik slowly turns around lmao
all this video is is just them laughing
Omg JJ's laugh is soo contagious 🤣
Jj's laugh lmfao
the best 10 minutes spend in my life
this reminded me so much of old school sidemen main channel vids omg i love it
They’ve spent so much time and effort in their main channel videos just for this to be the funniest shit they’ve ever uploaded
Five minutes into the game they started playing red light green light
I will do anything to see part 2
Vikks reaction time 😂
the way harry just boots him in the head
y'all gotta make a part 2 this was fucking hilarious 😂
#stopvikkabuse2020
They need to do the singing one
this is what people in my choir class do except a helmet and hitting in the head🤣
I was absolutely creasing the whole time
From this day forth vik was no longer the smartest sidemen
Why is this the funniest shit I’ve seen is so long 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My stomach hurts watching this, it's so simple but hilarious 😂😂😂
ksi lean up
Poor vik he got slap half of the video and he only slap 3 or 4 times I think he won’t do this kind of video anymore 😞
Bro vik only slapped only twice this whole vid 🥺😩
Luke 11:28 But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”🙌
4:50 5:25 7:00 8:36 9:00😭😭😭
8:38 jj's laugh tho
vik never clocked that people were slapping him on the opposite side of his head to where they were standing🤦🏽‍♂😂 even after he got out of the chair and saw people doing it
On vikks last round when he gets slapped on the head from Jj, you can tell Harry feels so bad for vikk.
This should be called the brain damage game.  Love it!! Lmao 😂
There needs to be another one of these. This got me so cracked up making my morning such a great start of the day.
Never before have I laughed so hard for so long. And what makes it so much better is that one of them probably just found a helmet on a shoot, gave it to vik and said “sit down”
imagine this in Squid game
Now this is some real return to monke type shit
😂😂😂😂↖️
#stopvikabuse
🤣🤣🤣🤣
We used to play this 6 years ago
They need one of those Francis train guy cameras for the person in the helmet lol
Jesus loves you all and don’t say the Lords name in vain
jj's laugh had me laughing the whole viddd
6:38 Simon knows his martial arts
HOW CAN SHE SLAP
DO ONE WITH CHIUNKZ FILLY AND HARRY PINERO!!!
Maza aa gya bhaiyo
This is actually so funny
You need to do this drunk.
Ethan u good? 4:40
Do helmet game 2, that was so jks I was dying with laughter
MORE OF THESE!😍😂
The veiws on point 3.35 m
Every time jj laughs I can the Ironman meme
On par with the moo off this
This is JJ's favourite game.
Sidemen legit only upload funny videos and i laugh at every video!
Ogs play it without a helmet
Vikk was crying and he was so frustrated
7:07    9:03  4:50 - 5:29  7:00
Stop vick abuse 😓😅🤣🤣
The title should be: Ksi laughing like he does for 9 minutes 46 seconds straight
i can't breath
Amazing video
Really hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Whose idea was this? I love it
Vik just casually taking up half the video in the beginning
Whats the point of playing this with the helmet
Me and my friends did this without the helmet
I've never laughed this hard at a video before😂😂😂 I'm crying 😭😂😂
funniest video since the helium challennge
This is better when vik was stuck on a chair 😂😂😂
we always play this in africa the only difference is that there is no helmet.
The mood went down as soon as vik got back on that chair. He was getting frustrated thay he couldnt guess who was slapping him and he forced himself to laugh yet showing how he just wanted this to end already because he knew he was the worse at guessing compared to the others.
I’ve never experienced so much laughter within 10 minutes
hitting vik around the head for 9 minutes straight
Seriously no references to the legendary Helmet Boy i am disappointed and whilst we're at it let's keep it old school with a #stopvikkabuse
PSA do not watch thing while you’re eating   You WILL choke
9 min of KSI choking 😝🤣
WHY DID THIS KILL ME OF LAUGHTER
They been saving their urge to bully vik for this one 😂
8:37 bro this is the funniest video on this channel 😂
And the vic abuse continues..
Best 10 minutes of my day 😂😂😂
Ethan maybe need a doctor appointment. Keep scratching his junk lmao
Guys can spend £20,000 on a holiday video, hundreds of hours of editing weeks of preparation but a 10 minute video of the lads hitting each other in the head will always be gold!
funniest sidemen video ever
7:08 best one 😂 I'm crying
vikk and tobi friendship is the best
why are they so stiff? it feels like they are all cringing and not comfortble
real sorry for vick
Vicstar such a loser ...slow reaction time...
They just beat the shit out of an Indian
#stopvikabuse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This game is the funniest , pls do it more often 😀
This ten min video was better than the hide and seek main channel video.
Best sidmen vid of 2022🤣
at 4:40 ethan got that itch
Can’t get over how Harry immediately turns around and points at Josh.🤣🤣
7:08 slap of the year! lol
Vik's chance were the best
Reason number 420,69 why women live longer than men lmao
This should be a pt 10 series
It’s fukin helmet boi origins mate 🤣🤣
This video is 1% talking 10% slapping 89% laughing
sidemen moo off 2022?
KSI low key told on harry look at his eyes 😂
Parah
never laughed for 10 mins straight in my life till this video
Harry is the goat for getting it first try
More of this plz ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
JJ's hair looks sick down
Now we know how JJ really broke his hand lol
I swear these lads be taking out all the anger and rage on each other XD. Loved the video boys, keep em coming! <3
Harry’s tone was so accusing it was hilarious
Bro when Harry kicked Vic I lost it
I havent laughed like this since 2015 gta vids
KSI at 7:09 is a perfect example of why he is so funny
i haven't laughed so much in forever holy shit
HELMET BOY HELMET BOY
Somehow might be the greatest sidemen video of all time
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nahhhh that was too short 😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
More like this plz
Hey miniminter how does it feel to be shorter than a 15 year old?
#stopvikabuse
Wtf did I just watch fam
We need more of these challenges
Non stop laughing this whole videos Harry’s was funny asf
JJ was dieing 😂😂😂
We need this to be annual like the moo off, except this will solely be done indoors and not in public with no twists. Just 7 grown men slapping each other and laughing till they can’t breathe.
This challenge is from indonesia man my country
My favourite thing is how many views this has 😂 three million people find seven idiots smacking each other over the head repeatedly entertaining. (Same..)
The funniest video I’ve ever seen
HILARIOUS
Jj laughs if the best
The smiley on the chain literally looks like dream 19 million subs merch 😂
I honestly love the slightly low production shoots. Just guys being dudes.
JJ should do more it would be fun 🤣
Vik got bullied
please do this with callux and calfreezy omg
producers: “alright let’s have them hit each other on the head and record them laughing for 9 minutes straight”
This was sick lmao 🤣
Bro vik sat there for a good 3 minutes 😂😂
This went from mild to me rolling out my chair funny😭😭😂😂
5:58 vik loved that one
Seeing half of these is what I would get when I was younger I’d be used to it having a good old clip around the lug
Y r the challenge videos always unmatched
🤣🤣🤣 I feel bad for vid
Pt 2 needed I cried laughing so hard 💀
This vid reminded me of the silent library n helium challenge vids so stupid but so funny at the same time looooool😂😂😂😂
#stopvikabuse Hahhahqhaha Vik got slapped many times in the beginning and the end
so fucking funny
Man my lungs 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Had to come back n watch this again 😭😭
THIS WAS TOO GOOD. WE NEED MORE OF THESE ASAP
Any south Africans will know we play this without the helmet but neckslaps all the time it is fun
Jj's laugh killed me every time🤣🤣
I was on the floor laughing 😊
This vid just kept geting funnier by every slap😂🤔
I have never laughed harder at a sidemen video
O my god😂 funny as hell! Should do this challenge more!
Low key Toby hits Vik lightly so he can get out the chair. Gangsta
could've cut this 30 seconds in
Petition for dead by daylight video on more sidemen
This was amazing I couldn’t stop laughing at this
Why would I cop a chain of something I ain’t part of like the sidemen group? I get ILLVZN because it is a legit clothing line, but wearing someone’s logo around?
this is the new moo off yea
Jj tho😂😂
vic abuse 😂😂😂
More! More! More!
Thank u so much for this vid u made my day cuts I have COVID  Can u do a part 2 pls

They killed once Vik introduced the hand thingy😂
Ik crying of laughter🤣🤣🤣
Part 2!!!
Simple title : the sidemen bullying vik aka vikram
this is extremely funny mostly bc of KSIs laugh track the entire time
😂
I will surely play this game with my friends,it looks funny and entertained
Omg I need more of these videos in my life! I have never laughed so much 😂 JJ’s laugh every time 😂😂😂😂
This should have been titled hitting vikkstar123 for 6 minutes straight🤣🤣
For real tho, why is Ethan playing with himself throughout this vid? 🤢
5:27 ethan wanted to explode bruv😭
We used to play this game when we where kids but the thing it was without a helmet 😂😂
When I saw Vik wear the helmet I remembered their GTA videos "Helmet boy origins!!". Only OGs will know.
Should definitely do this again but if you guess wrong gotta take a drink or shot  😄 🤣 😂
Ngl this is a montage of Vik being beaten up :)
Videos like this take me back to the helium challenge. The real ones know exactly know what I’m taking about.
Play without the helmet
Nah this video had me dying
HELIUM CHALLENGE
this is the best hairstyle ksi ever had
I hope there will be a Part 2 of this. MY STOMACH!!!! 😂
Vik is such a gem man🤣
Sidemen laughing for 9 mins straight. Gold
So simple but so hilarious!!!
This video has me laughing like literally on the floor
more of this and less of the drinking 1 color bullshit
Kai enjoyed this one more than any sidemen video ever 😂😂😂😂
rip vik
This gives me 12 yr old sleepover vibes
JJ’s laugh entertained me the most 🤣🤣😂😂 Im still laughing
4:46 def sounds like added laughs
This could’ve been a sidemen Sunday
So dumb. But still so good.
This video is just JJ dying cause of laughter
They should do this in public with people to guess who slapped em out of the sidemen to win some money  , IDEA FOR THE SIDEMEN ;)
U guys should make a vid with Jidion mann
Vik star big brain but not at guessing
He wore the helmet for so long, he really is helmet boy.
8:53 Simon almost said my nigga 😭🤣🤣
6:38 bro that took me out 😂
Ofc vik got beat up lmao

Holy shit, this is easily the best vid from y'all in 2022 so far.
Funniest sidemen video I’ve seen in a while!
Watched this video 6 times. Hour well spent!
5:55 JJ was so proud and shocked with vik's hit 🤣🤣🤣💀
I've never laughed so hard in my life
Why not title the video, Bullying vik
Whenever I need a laugh, I now know where to come
We need more of this💀💀
Sorry to be the buzzkill here but the fact that this has >2M views, 6k comments says a lot about people these days.  Don't you folks have anything better to do than watch this nonsense?
sidemen 9 minutes of laughing
The simplicity of this video makes it even better, need more of these easy to film skit type videos man
Helmet boy was testing his helmet from the gypsy slaps

This was the modern day moo off 😂
8:38 my last 2 brain cells in the physics exam

The way Harry says ''you" every time he gets slapped 😂
Never thought I would laugh so much watching a bunch of friends hit each other and trying to guess who did it.
Poor Vik man. He was scared to slap again after his first seat. Little did he know that he'll be violated a lot more at the end.
HELMET BOY ORIGINS
5:27 look at Ethan’s face

we do this in serbia without the helmet
I laughed until I cried.  this was simple and genius

Tobi not slapping so he doesn’t get guessed
It's actually a really effective way to get rid of some brain cells.
6:38 palm striked lol
Most simple b the most hilarious
Stop vik abuse
Content
There was no reason this was so funny. Had me spitting my drink out. Please more. Poor Vikk but this was great.
8:19 STOPPP—
I’ve never laughed like that In my entire life
These are adults
We are men, we are simple 🤣
JJs laugh sometimes sounds like Morty crying
Josh should get waves
One of rhe best vids recently, laughed my ass off
Harry: 'Feel where its coming from, feel where its coming from'  Josh: sideways destruction
I've never seen a simpler concept, but I was still gone LMAOOO
When Ethan and JJ laugh, i cant and will never hold it. Those 2, unreal laughs. They make my day.
This is hilarious Josh fully sends it. Ethan practially jabbing them and vik was just guessing for so long
Fuckin hell, I don’t think I’ve cried this hard laughing to anything ever 😭😭 the laughs intensified more and more holy shit, what a banger 😂🙌🏼
HELMET BOY ORIGINS

Tobi's laugh 😂 pure evil
Stop vikk abuse 😂

Justice for Vik
I love the new way JJ puts his hair ❤
Simple but funny
One of yall best videos in a minute holy shit
Gay Lords what is that cringe laugh
6 British people bullying Indian guy 🤣🤣
The title of the video should hav been "sidemen laughing for straight 9:48 mins" 😂😂 or "vik getting bullied for 5 mins"🤣🤣💀
They should do blind fold pillow fight
Lads I never laughed the way I did while I was watching this vid keep the bangers coming 🤣
Part 2!!!!!
watch this video again but pay special attention to ethan every time he slaps, his face trying to hold his laughter in is the funniest shit ive seen in a while
Sidemen vids bang, sidemenreacts is chill, but moresidemen is the perfect middle of hectic but semi organized 1:27 3:15 father-son relationship game strong 3:37 ZERKAA MIND GAMES 9:03 visual representation of zerkaa vs vik in golf it vids LMAO
Welcome to the sidemen
When the MoreSidemen videos feel like an old Sidemen main channel video it’s gonna be a good day
i need to do this with my friends 😂😂😂😂😂
BEST video Ever
Welp Harry has his helmet on boys. You know what that means😂😂😂😂😂
FUCKING HELL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's great because they all bully eachother equal amounts, top tier banter.
Cry laughing at this 😂 thank you!
This video has cured my depression
I wish they did this as a sidemen sunday
Vik abuse back?
Legend has it that they’re still laughing
JJ looks like the Preditor with the hair backwards lol
This should be a full 2 hour sidemen Sunday
This game we used to play when we were child in India and without the helmet.But quite fun seeing this game and reliving childhood
My jaw hurts I was laughing so much 😂
Damnnn i remember playing a version of  this in high school  ahaha (without the helmet obviously  )
sidemen for life !!! yuhuuuu !!!
We've finally seen the return of helmet boy origins
#stopvikabuse
reality's greatest 9 minutes and 45 seconds is 6 adult males hiting another adult male who has a helmet on
I love the "OOF"
The return of helmet boy!!
Yeo I’m crying 😂

Elmet boi origins
Sidemen giving themselves concussions for fun is why we like em so much
Y’all gave vik brain damage 🤣
The sidemen put out 100,000 grand vids and im just as entertained if not more by this XD. Thanks for the content lads
my pick is @7:08 cuz of ethan
#STOPVIKABUSE
This the funniest video so far lol
4:40 - JJ pointed at Harry with eyes 🤣🤣

Watched this at 1am and had to bite my lip so I could stop myself from laughing like a hyena. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have not laughed like that in a longggg time
but why do I wanna play this game now? 😂 💀
Absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂
the title straight away reminded me of helmet boy adventures lol and it was fitting he was first and last
Love the challenges like theses
Vikk was supposed to be the smart one
JJ's laughs makes this challenge so much better
I’ve never been this disappointed with vik lmaoo use the logic if they hit you on your right they’re hitting you from the left and if they hit you on your left they’re on the right😂😂 I was lowkey pissed
I cried 😂😂😂
I think we all need part 2
Vik used maths instead of commonsense.... Poor kid
These types of games seem so damn primitive but it's so fun just to watch. Feels like something our ancestors would do and have fun I don't know why I love it.
Hysterical
Why are we all laughing just by looking at people get hit by the head with helmet on😂😂😂😂
They need to do this again but instead its a try not to laugh version with forfeits maybe? Was still such a funny video regardless 😂
More of these stupid funny minigames please :D!
This is hella funny😅😅😅👌
sidmen doing chiropractic adjustments next week,confirmed
Though vik was supposed to be the smart one
Vikkabuse
Guys JJ is actually dying😂
Leave it out of assignment to do something very stupid like this, But it’s very entertaining
I will play this with my friends
funny ain't enough to describe this one 🤣
bro this was the funniest sidemen video ive seen in a while
Na this is the funniest sidemen video to date
I was hoping so much I could see JJ be in the helmet 😂
The caption should’ve been “we bullied vikkstar” Bc that’s what it looked like 😭
Bullying Vik Season Has Started 😂
I watched this yesterday, now im watching it again lol
Vikk didn’t slap anyone for ages cos he didn’t want to be the one with the helmet 😂
I have never seen the sidemen laugh so much
i loved this game in primary
Vikk got bullied again
I could fucking watch this shit whole day not even kidding lmfao
i laughed the whole video beed more of this type of stuff
Hahaha love this bro keep it up sidemen you have grown so big in short time wow amazing
No way there’s not gonna be a #stopvikkabuse post on reddit
Use me as a dislike button
this game is the embodiment of it is only funny until youre in that position.
this was vikks best opportunity to bring helmet boy back
It should be titled 'SIDEMEN GIVE EACH OTHER BRAIN DAMAGE FOR 9 MINUTES'
I sat and watched this 😂😂… and I am sober
#STOPVIKABUSE
Goodness gracious me that was like a forfeit for everyone
The CTE game
8:48 bruh SIMON,what did u say
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen on Sidemen for a long time 😂😂
Glimpse of OG vik bullying 😂
Imagine if they just kept Vik in the chair by telling him that he always got it wrong
This is by far the funniest thing i have seen in a looooooong time
6:55 Tobi's reaction LMAO
Should have changed the title to beating *vikk* with a helmet on🤣
Best vid in years, short and always entertaining
This is so hilarious
"aight, time to film a video... anyone have any ideas?" "oh, I know 😈"
Do annual subscribers get the chain for free?
#STOPVIKKABUSE
Vik getting bullied in 4k ,😂😂

As the wise wroetoshaw once said, "this is what the sidemen have become"
Bro this shit was as good as a tinder video!!!
JJs laugh 😂😂💀
Vikk was so scared of wearing the helmet that he didn't hit for a long time XD. And when he did, he ended up wearing it again lmao
These are the best types of videos reminded me of the eggs over the head with helium ahahah
Do another but vikk is the other one that get hit
2:15 JJ’s done it again  *insert iron man vfx*
Was JJ on drugs?
I was sure this was gonna be 9+ minutes of slapping Vikk
Why is this so entertaining and funny😂
They should def do another one of these
If that's not a guilty face @ 5:26 then I don't know what is 💀😂
I had a permanent smile on my face for this whole video 😂
Anyone know how to claim for the side+ chain
GOD BLESS
Is some one's having a bad day and watches these, it would make their day better for sure
Could not stop laughing. What a video
That video made me laugh under 15 seconds lol I hope they do a part 2 just for the laughs
Oh I laughed way too hard, this could've been an hour longer and it still wouldn't be enough
solid video
They way ksi just laughs louder to cover the screams of his pain in his hand😂😂 8:37
Vik barely slapped anyone and he took the most damage. Poor guy stop vik abuse 2022
Why is this so enjoyable
How bout football flinch?
Holy shit 🤣try a try not to laugh with this😂🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣clearly one of your funniest videos🤣i literally cried while laughing🤣🤣🤣🤣

They should stick to these type of videos. Cheap for them and untlimited entertainment for us
Helmet basically spinning around Vik’s head.  I’m dead 🤣
Vik will always be helmet boy
#stopvikabuse

We need more of this! 🤣
Yo who is putting the Only Fans accounts in the comments? Are you that desperate or are pickings just slim?
These boys don't need more brain damage, especially Harry. But who doesn't love torturing your best friends and causing them to forget half the alphabet or thier mom's birthday. Or both hahaha
8:38 gotta be the funniest one cause of how jj just laughs right after 😂😂😂
This is one next-level slap bukkake.
8:38 LOL
Vik did not enjoy that last gang bang 💀 took him straight back to the dark days
Now *THIS* is a video idea xD
This was hilarious af😭
I need pt 2
Lmao jj's laughing is just making me laugh even harder
this brings back early sidemen vibes... should've been every wrong guess, you get egged!!!!
Honestly one of the funniest SDMN videos I've watched in a while 😆
vik is too nice he doesn't slap anyone
pls sidemen squid game
This is my favourite more sidemen video!!😂😂
this shit has me dyin
officially my favourite video on youtube
Reminds me of when they played scream go hero together. They could title this the sidemen hit each other and laugh for 10 minutes straight.
fookin' helmit boi maaaate! The superhero from Mars makes an unlikely return!
This was totally Harry's idea and I love it so fucking much
you kents r fked
great video that is such a simple idea executed perfectly
This one cracked me up ong this is 🅿️
This was overly funny for no reason💀
I need to see this with callux and freezy
8:17 JJ: “It begins”. Is lolz 😂,… given how long Vik’s turn lasted the first time around.
This is as about as playable as BEETONE WHAT THIS MEANS
The real sidemen are back
Jj's laughs in the second half tho. I don't have my Jaw anymore cause I laughed so hard in this vid.
It took vik 6 minutes to deliver his first slap. Just thought id let you know
do more of these stupid shitty minigames its so fun
NAH Forreal this is the perfect video to make toast to🤣🤣🤣
Thins may be one of my favourite sidemen never mind more sidemen videos
Watch this video in 0.5x 🤣
8:38 JJ's shaking his hand in pain, and Vik STILL couldn't get that it was him, lmaooo
Best more sidemen video of all time
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I’m dead lol
Watch Runningman to find another content
These are exactly the types of funny stupid challenges I missed seeing!
4:14  5:26
Sick video😂😂
Helmet boy origins returns
this is what  we need more of, JJ's laugh through the whole thing just made it more hilarious.
Never in a million years would I see myself laughing so hard over 7 men smacking each other on the head, but here we are
0:13 Helmet boy's real life adaptation
Just me who didn’t find it as funny as them, cool video tho
Proper helium challenge sidemen vibes
4:40 We can see JJ hinting poor Harry here, KSIMON is still a thing
This is lowkey one of their funniest videos, yet so simple. More of these silly challenges!🤣
Ratio
Jesus loves you all ✝️❤️
Jj maniacally laughing whilst slapping is the best thing I’ve ever seen
this was soo funny i couldnt stop laughing 🤣

a SIUUUUUU off would be outstanding!!
Helmet boy origins
Need a second version 😂😂
why was this so funny
I love the sidemen so much but it’s genuinely so hard to watch anything with these stupid ads. Two 15 seconds ads that you can’t skip!!!! Wow thanks YouTube you money hungry dictators. You also removed the dislike buttons cuz ur all scum.!
This video slapped
How do we claim the chain on the 31st ??
W VID
Harry’s halfway through the vid was the funniest
this is fucking legendary
Vik successfully always chooses the opposite side.
9:05 enjoy
I was laughing so hard the whole video 😂😂
I'm crying, my jaw is in pain but I don't regret a thing. This is honestly one of the simplest and effective video I've ever watched
I really expected this whole video just to be Vic getting slapped
we need the anual moo off
8:48 Simon said my nigga
Funniest videos I've seen in a long time
gonna need a part 2 of this asap
i cant believe my level of humour has dropped down to watching 7 grown men slapping each other’s head 😭😭
Some say This video slaps hard
8:39 I CANTTT
DO A NEXT ON PLS🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I didn’t expect this video to be so good but it was lol 😂
Vikk needs to go straight to the doctor 🤣🤣🤣
That chain at the start, is the gonna be free to all Side+ members from that date? I want it
😂😂😂 when I say I haven’t ever laughed this hard 😂
Watch this video get taken down
Ethan was fully sending the slaps I'm dying 😂😂😂
i laughed the whole video not one moment did i stop laughing
This is just 9 minutes and 46 seconds of laughter😂
What a great video guys♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Hilarious. Wouldn’t mind this being a main channel video
They dead beating up vik😭😭
5:48 viks evil side comes out
What is this setting tho 😂
this is basically the new moo off
Vik at the beginning 🤣
The whole video be like🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro i laughed for so long I became dehydrated
This is mad😂😂😂😂😂😂
is the chain free for side+ members or do i have to buy it?
this is what i subbed 5 years ago for i think harry kicking vik in the head is so funny
reignited vik abuse 🤣
Rip Vikk lol
bro im dying :DDDDD
Literally the Beginning, Middle and End of the video was Vik 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Evil plan, just don't tell the person even he is right and keep slapping one of your friend all day long...
This really should be done without a helmet bc you dont feel any pain this way wich is what makes this game fun
I’ve been laughing by so hard it feels like I’ve been the one wearing the helmet 😂😂😂😂
I loved this so much 😂😂 it's so stupid and thats why its soooo funny ahahha 😂😂😂😭😂
At 8:15 Tobi and Ethan are perfectly in sync
This video should’ve been called “sidemen laughing for 9 minutes”
Losing braincells in 9:46 minutes
My cheeks physically hurt from laughing 😭😭😂😂😂
Simple videos are funnier than the longer ones. they should do more short 25 minute videos imo.
Ethans laugh was filled with laughter and quilt 😂
Feels like old sidemen again
Simple and funny
I was hoping Vic was finally gonna snack tf out of them
This is honestly One of the best sidemen videos ever. Just them hitting each other and then laughing. Thats all you hear, no Intro, no talking. Perfectly rounded off with that weird ass background music. Just 10 minutes of pure stupid laughter XD
5:38
Dude KSI’s laugh throughout this video tho 😂
we play this at school without a helmet
#StopVikAbuse
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is this the best sidemen video ever
Hilarious
my chest is killing me from laughing so much
Bots can piss off fr
This concept is gold . Pls more of these pls
Toby made sure the video wasnt 10minutes, nice one
Bruh that was a Vik punishment lmao 🤣
I love this video but please more frequent gta
Harry’s real laugh came back out
Petition For A Part 2 ! 😂 , Maybe they can add more ppl or add little challenges/features. They can also set new rules to make it more fair and more randomized.
I swear to God, this is the funniest video they’ve ever made, like ive never seen all of them laugh this hard 😭😭
is it me or are the sidemen drunk in this vid?
i laughed a lil too much
that's the shit 🤣 this why we subscribed sidemen for 🤣🤣
One of the best videos! Up there with the old school pro clubs 9/11 jokes!🤣🤣
I need to know where Behz got that jacket?!
I'm dead pls do more!🤣
9:10 oh my god tobi😂
3:29 Josh got a Netherite helmet💀💀💀💀
Why was this so short !!?? I’m dying 😂
Such a simple video but so funny, I couldn’t stop laughing 😂🤣
The fact that this would’ve been a main channel sidemen video 2 years ago is insane! Love it to bits😂
In South Africa 🇿🇦 we do it without the helmet ⛑ so yah it's more funny without it
i wouldn’t be surprised if Vikk turns into a villain
They are enjoying the slapping way too much and so am I 😂😂😂😂
7:07 oh my Lord 😆😆😆😂😂😂
I need more
i had to pause and finish laughing.
Made zero sense I loved it
I’ve never laughed at every second of a video before that was hilarious
Vik was in the chair for over 2 minutes lol
We really love to see one more video like this😂😂❤️❤️
Ngl vik was tapped in this 😂
i have never laughed for 10 min straight
Her: He’s probably cheating on me 😒 Me and the boys:
funniest yt vid ive seen in a whileeee XDD
its indonesia games, so funny u guys playing this game 😂😂
Bro Harry got murdered!!!
i just watched 7 fully grown men slap each other with a helmet on for 10 minutes and i did not stop laughing
🤣🤣🤣
Helmet boy is back
I was dying the whole time watching it XD
I needed this
#stopvikabuse
Tobi and especially vik are just bored to slap
We definitely need more of these bruhh
This is just a video of the sidemen smacking tf out of vik to make him lose brain cells so they’re all as smart as him🤦🏽‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
It's all fun and games but at some point you have to draw a boundary. 8:18 was totally uncalled for and quite disrespectful.
my head is hurting from laughing too much
I am dying right now, can’t hold in my laughter when JJ is laughing that much that he is coughing
Incredible, no editing, no special effects, just 6 lads having a laugh and 1 losing brain cells   Brilliant
We need a p2
Just a bunch of guys laughing Hysterically
Omg please do this with chunks , young filly and harry and darkest man this would break YouTube !!!! Never laughed so hard
Vik got slapp so much that his brain couldn't process who it was
They should take a shot if they don’t guess right 😂
They should play this when they were drunk. Hahaha
I haven’t laughed through an entire video in so long 😂😂
Goated video
I’ve never laughed so hard at a sidemen video😂
This is hilarious Josh fully sends it. Ethan practially jabbing them and vik was just guessing for so long
so ummm how u get the chain of u r a sub to side+

i have never laughed so hard for 10 mins str8 bro this is my fav vid
They do anything for views
It’s the vids where you guys are genuinely enjoying yourselves that become the videos which people look back and watch more in the longrun
This is dumb but need another was dying 😂👌

This is fucking hilarious, if you're watching this in future buckle up

past 8:18 VIK STARTED COWERING!! I'M IN TEARSS!!!😂🤣😂🤣
I could watch this for an hour
I’m cryinggggg why is this so funnyyyy 😭
vik is nice kid
This is the PEAK🤣❤️ Sidemen you guys make our miserable days better with your videos  Stay blessed all of you Yes even u Ethan
my stomach hurts this is so stupid lmao
i like how vik didnt want to hit them
This is similar to something we used to play but there was no helmet and the guys who are hitting cant speak or laugh if you laugh and you can see someones teeth all of you hit him until he names 5 brands of cars like bmw skoda audi or something and then he goes in the middle
2:15 jj sounds like the intro to a playboi carti song
the laughing is contagious 😭
Vikk is so bad at this lol
‘elmet boi origins
Ethans face when he hits is so funny
Part 2😂😂😂😂 pleaseee
I beg make more of these like a part 2!!
When jj slapped vik at the end and instantly laughed at himself had me rolling🤣🤣
Annual?
At 8:40 Ksi sound like Pingu
Just another day for the Sidemen violating Vikk 😂😂
I turned on subtitles for some reason and it only showed laughter 🤣🤣🤣
I can't stop laughing from the start of the vid man. I hope more of this please 😂😂
We need yung filly and chunkz join in this game!!🤣
The boys playing the game, JJ back there dying 😂
imagine if it was a try not to laugh plus the slapping
One of the best sidemen videos I've ever seen. Right after the new Among us video More Sidemen is outshining the main channel
Pov ur jj: ahahaa🏎🏎🏎🏎
I haven't laughed harder to any sidemen content. This is simplistic yet so thoroughly funny. I can barely tyoe
#vikkabuse flashbacks
I love how KSI was dying for 9 minutes
I was just waiting for JJ’s turn
This would be an excellent game at a party or when you're drunk
I was just waiting for JJ’s turn
When Harry instantly points at josh 😂
Litrelly one of the best videos funny as hell
where are ethans hand going at 4:38
Vik was gone by the end… this man still chose josh while JJ was literally in pain right in front of him😭😭 we need a part 2 of this😂
Now this is therapy 😂😂😂
me in middle school
this game used to get so intense in my school
The facts that Simon decided to kick him in the head 😂😂 8:18
is that jj's new house?
Slaps Record💥... JJ: 2 Simon: 3 Tobi: 5 Harry: 7 Josh: 9 Ethan: 10 Vik: 25

Classic sidemen video, just a dumb game with the boys

Almost 10 mins watching ppl slap their friends heads and laugh 😅 Quality content xx
We used to play this in school in eastern europe :)) Let's just say a lot of kids got bullied :))
I have laughed too hard at this one
Sometimes its the most low-budget, simplest of videos that are the funniest lmao
Now this is what you can call: Fkg good Content 😂👌🏻
This was all an elaborate plan to cause enough brain damage to Vik to bring him closer to their IQ level
Need another
Fockin helmet boy is back!!!
Ethan's face after hitting someone kills me
This reminds me of the Old sidemen videos! Such a vibe!
This video only cost a helmet but It never failed to make me laugh.😂🤣😂

#stopvikkabuse

#stopvikviolation
They are probably laughing after looking at the views "let's see how far we can go with these content ideas and still get these many news"
Ethan's faces had me dying in this vid. It was incredible scenes watching this.
this is just wholesome honestly, their laughs are too contagious
Had me rolling
8:39  jj 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
man this is a video ive laughed endlessly in a long time. These boys need to understand that production quality is just a third of content making. Its the fun and laugh they create in front of even one camera is what people love to see. Love these guys man!
2 mins in and my face hurts from laughing
MORE!
This one's for the boys
4:13 *_ayo Tobi what happened_*

They should do this combined with silent library
8:38 killed me
#stopvikkabuse
Helmet Game II - Grab Randolph, Callux, etc. but whoever hits the helmet and they didn’t get selected, the person that got selected is eliminated and steps out and enjoys the show. If the person with the helmet didn’t guess who it was when it came down to two people, the people who slap the helmet or been eliminated wins.
8:48 what did he say
7:00 mins in, look at ethans face after the slap 😂😂😂😂
🤣
Bro Behz face at 5:28 lol
Vik is really bad at this game
Imagine if this is how helmet makers test their helmets
We need a yearly one of these 😭😂
This was beyond hilarious 😂😂😭
Everyone trying to guess who hit them  Meanwhile KSI: *Starts Laughing* 🤣
Prefer this 9 minute video to a lot of Sidemen Sunday videos to be honest.
Tobi legit went ROFL
What a video!
#stopvikkabuse

ngl JJ looks really good with that hair style
this had me in tears

Can’t. Believe this video came from a tiktok
That’s a new definition of abusing vik 😂
Simon looks fucking sick with that facial hear, can't lie
Vik didn't wanted to go again so he only hit 2 times but he get caught again
Vik gets bullied like mad they just don’t rate him lmao
I cried of laughter

I think this was just a plan to beat up Vik😂
Stop Vic abuse

We have the similar game but instead of helmet we cover our eyes and everyone else hit on head,the person have to guess who hit them first. This was amazing, my jaws were in pain from laughing🤣🤣

This video is by far the funniest video they have done in so long
Vik bullying needs to stop
One of the funniest vids I’ve seen in a while! 😂
After the video ended, my mom walked in my room and asked why my face was so red.

Vik got more brain damage than an NFL lineman 🤣
Vikk is the real legend 😂
#stopvikkabuse

This the the most MoreSidemen video I've ever seen lmaooo
Do a part 2 its hella funny XD
I want the exact amount of slaps vik gave to other ppl. i feel like he didnt even slap once xD
If you hit Josh too hard he might break a bone cause of old age...
This video was hilarious, nearly peed myself from all the laughing! And JJ's laugh when he realised how much it hurt hitting the helmet..🤣 absolute class.
Haha JOKES
WE NEED MORE this was jokes
her: "he's probably out cheating" him:
At 3:12 JJ’s laugh sounds like a crow Lmfao
first time seeing harry laugh a lot
These are exactly the types of funny stupid challenges I missed seeing!🤣
Vikk looked like he genuinely didn't like this video. 😂
Why this stupid video is so hilarious 😂😂
FAX: vik only hit twice and got caught in 1 of them
Helmet boy might have to retire after this.
THIS is the content we need 😂😂😂
The way Vikk always looked the wrong way I can't hahahaha
I'm crying of laughter lmao
This was so funnnnnt
please more content of you all just fucking around
This is one of the funniest videos ever😂😂😂
first sidemen video under 10 minutes in 2022
the best sidemen video i’ve seen for a while🤣
We need more of these mini games that are oddly funny for some reason
The whole video had me creasing but 8:38 jj’s slap had me crying 😂😂😂😂😂
That kick from Harry 🤣
Tobi doing nothing as usual
i love how these are funnier than the vids they put so much production into😂
This shit it the funniest thing ive seen this year 😂😂😂😂
7:08 Best slap
jj: how to bully vik legally? josh: takes out helmet
Imagine doing this but you all just act like they never get it right lmao, see how long they'll let you slap them
Sidemen playing tapli dav😂😂

Tapli dav😂
So good 😂😂
You need to do more! I was just lmao the whole time!!
1's of my funniest sidemen video I've seen so far 🤣😂
I thoroughly enjoyed this shithousery :)
But this moment at 6:10, they all laughing then silence and after josh hits they continue previous laughs, like they didn't finish them🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do I find it so fascinating that 7 men hit each other on the head for almost 10min
Times Slapped Someone - Ethan - 15 Harry - 6 JJ - 9 Josh - 7 Simon - 15 Tobi - 8 Vik - 2  Amount of times they were guessed -  Ethan - 6 Harry - 11 JJ - 8 Josh - 16 Simon - 4 Tobi - 9 Vik - 5  Even though Simon slapped the (drawn) most times he was still least guessed Although Josh only slapped 3rd least amount of times he was still guessed nearly 1.5x as second most guessed
The slaps got harder every time🤣🤣
funniest sidemenn second channel no cap!!
dude simon dosent look like a little girl anymore
the dumbest shit is always the funniest hahaha
Disclaimer - no Vikk was damaged during the video.
Did I just watch 7 grown men slap each other’s head? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes.
Simon and JJ's face when laughing after Vik slapped Ethan really hard was so funny.
The fact that Vik slapped only twice ishilarious
Incognito man
Predator looking good today
Do more like this 😂😂😂
Harrys “you” was so cute
Vik literally slapped the helmet twice after he was in and got in cus of one of em hahahaha
Concussion City lol
Rename it to bullying vikk😂.
My cheeks started hurting in the first 30 secs
This video made me laugh you so bad. Lmaooo. 🤣
I ALMOST PEED MYSELF
This is main sidmen  channel content ong I miss old videos like this
This idea is newest and trending on tiktok right now, funny video and simple mini game ever made 😂
This video is better than the HIde and seek and JJ's reddit video combined. Need more of these!!!
I didn’t realise the video was 9 mins 😂 i was laughing the whole 9 mins
Ethan’s face killed me 😀
#StopVikAbuse :(
Do you get the chain automatically or do I need to like register for it
I didn't know we were getting KSI's boxing training footage?
Bruh I've never laughed this hard for 9 minutes straight lmao well done lads
This game should be a part of the Silent Library..XD
What a masterpiece
The Sidemen, you guys are super hilarious!!!!!!
This has to be the funniest sidemen video of recent times. I don't usually laugh out loud while watching videos but this had me rolling on my bed. I want a part two
My lads saw a helmet, and just had fun with it lmao I needed this laugh, my day is now complete. 😂
I have never laughed this much in a long time😂😂
Do a part 2
The fact that this is probably one of the lowest productions they’ve made in a long time and still one of the funniest videos they’ve also made in a long time
This vid's in direct competition with the moo-offs for the vid which made me laugh the most.
Ahahahahaha plz more of this helmet game I receive hilarious content u get likes😂👍
I mean good vid but this is such a cheap sidemen sunday however its good seeing these little minigames

they should do it again but this time with the do it quit like they did in the libary where jj got whipped
LMFAOOOO
So amazing
That chain low key 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂might have to go get one
Why is this in my opinion one of the their greatest videos of all time? I’m rolling 🤣
8:37 i love how JJ instantly regretted it
Who knew the amount of laughter that can come from a helmet and a chair would be so abundant 😂😂
#STOPVIKKABUSE
helmet boy
Vik only slapped one person the whole video that also one time😂😂
The way Josh smacked Vik and he turned his head around like this b*tch and Toby falling on the floor cuz of it💀💀
STOP VIK BULLYING ... This is just a mean to bully poor vikkstar123 😂😂😂
#stopvikkabuse
banger
such a terrifying feeling  somebody hits ur head then u turn around six dudes laughing at you
This is better than some sidemen Sunday’s
listening to this with audio only would sound so sus 😩
this is true moresidemen content...love it
Sidemen 2016 vibes
Dont bully vik
I just watched 6 grown men slap their mates head for 9 minutes straight, and absolutely died from laughter.
We used to do these in school but without helmet. I can feel their pain.
Bulling Vik for 3 min.....This is a Violation
i love to see jj enjoying it this much 😂
The fact that it took Vik 2 minutes to get out of the chair when others did it first try 😂
history repeats itself, Britishers are beating the shit out of an Indian 😂😂😂
id take an hour of something like this over a hide and seek
They fcked vik so bas that he didnt take a chance again
So simple and easy yet so entertaining. Perfect content
I cried laughing
When the delivery boy ate Harry's Nandos 8:19 .🤣🤣🤣
Couldn't stop laughing....literally
This one’s actually a good sidemen Sunday for a change u should keep doing these they’re awesome!!!!
funny
Where can I redeem the side+ chain at?
This the only video to make me laugh Soo hard with tears
Well that was quick🥴🥴🥴LOL 😂😂😂😂 3:15
I saw someone do this, and thought the sidemen should do it and the actually did lol
JOSH HAS A BIG HEAD!!!!!
this makes me want to see them do like another patience test like back in the day but they probably think they do big for that now
Please make a part 2
josh has a notoriously heavy hand in any video that requires throwing at or hitting his friends. it's literally so entertaining watching him wallop the guys
4:50 Funniest part. Hahahahahaha. The start of them hitting hard on the helmet... Lmao
this shoudve been the sidemen sunday
first time i had a good laugh in a while
This had me in TEARS
Vik being bullied for 9 mins! Lmao
They turn arnd too slow tho they are supposed to turn around right aft they gt hit correct?
you gotta love tobi for going easy on Vik.... what a lad
Bruh I love yous but I wait every Sunday for this and it’s 9 min that sucks
vikk looking like a delivery driver
Wtf are we laughing at people slapping each other in the head 🤣🤣
sidemen give each other a mild concussion 😂
this has gotta be one of the most entertaining videos
8:37 - best moment
Alternate title:Sidemen giggle like toddlers for 9:46
I found myself laughing along with them almost the entire video
The real title of this should have been: Seven grown men slap each other and onset the dementia by three years
Just a video of men laughing 😂
We need more like these please sidemen, it was bloody funny 😂
You already know one of them thought of this on the spot. “Hey guys, let’s all give each other brain damage for a quick 10 minutes video” 💀💀💀💀
Sick video
KSI's laugh i live for it they all sound funny it always cracks me up as much as the skit its self😂
MY man jj laughing like as if his doing karate
So vikkstar123 was not the brightest!!
How much effort do you want to put in the video? Sidemen: No
Just Put the quality on high , AND LOOK AT THEIR EYES XDDD ( IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW )
Nearly 10 minutes of me not able to breathe from laughing
Vik finally introduced sidemen to "aakh band tapli"
GF: he is probably out cheating her BF with the boys:
How much is sideplus for
bro i havent laughing this in a while pls do more these types of vids...
9:01 LMAO Josh’s hit
Josh is one of those guys that always slaps too hard
Yall do know you can look immediately as soon as you get hit so you can see the arm movement
JJ looks like the predator 7:51
More of theseeeee!
All sidemen feeling the way JJ felt all this time bullying vik.
this has no business being this funny
The fact that there is 9 minutes of this-
Ethans laugh is contagious
silent library pls
I think vic enjoyed that . Mans saw jjs Handshaking and still chose old man josha 😂
this was jokes. lol.
Tf did I just watch 😂

Fuckin hell, I don’t think I’ve cried this hard laughing to anything ever 😭😭 the laughs intensified more and more holy shit, what a banger 😂🙌🏼
Vikk really slapped twice and got the seat twice. Sad
it doesnt seem as funny to us because when u think about it standing behind one of them and constantly slaping thier head only for them to look back and guess some other person actually seems rly funny
Cards against humanity
Bro josh hits so unnecessary hard it’s so funny
Old sidemen vibes we want part 2
Girls: I Bet he’s out there cheating on me  Him:
I hope they do more of these😂😂😂😂
Part 2 please
They need to do this type of challenges moreee 😂😂

helmet boy origins
Simple idea but this made my evening thanks Lads.

Funny and that was vikk abuse
We need more of this
First half should be named “British bullying Indian”
I love how vikk only slapped twice out of fear of ending up on the chair again  not that it worked out well for him
Sidemen: For our male audience...
vik abuse 2.0
Helmet boy origins 🪖

These remind me of the old sidemen challenges
Best sidemen game so far

Vikk didn’t even hit anyone until 6 minutes in
#stopwikabuse
Straight up can watch this 5 times this is golddd
What’s in the menue ?..   Sidemen: Brain damage.

Honestly, The more Simple & Stupid the more i love it.

It’s helmet boy
Thanks for the great content boys
Vikk abuse was in full effect
We need a part 2 of this 😂❤️
The fact that Vikk didn't slap anyone much for the fear of getting beaten up again 😂😂
What a video 😂😂😂
Sidemen are running out of ideas, substandard video!
JJ was laughing crying so bag, he made himself actually look sad😂
From the way other sidemen easily identified the hitter, I think vikk let them hit him on purpose. I dont know exactly what reason but probably to make the game more fun. What a lad 🥺🥺
This video gives Sidemen Moo-Off vibes lmao
I was literally crying the whole vid 😭😭😭
#stopvikkabuse
If they put there outro on they would have made 10 minutes just saying
*Physical "Brain" Damage*
Only 9 minutes this is a stinker lads good video to short
#stopvikkbully

Haven't laughed so much In a long time , helmet games need to become a thing , as many as you can think up , and have vikk as helmetboy run it as a sidemen sunday
Aakh band tapli is better ...............
This is what sidemen used to be.
Vik didn’t slap until six minutes cause he was scared after the first round lmao

It's soo funny when vikk gets bullied 😂😂😂
this was 9 : 45 seconds of pure stupidity and I loved it lmao :)
Thumbnail is sus thooooo😵
This is the content we missed from the prime era of the sidemen
This gives me vibes of the boys doing dumb shit in the old houses where they taped vick up, and Ethan and JJ’s contagious laughter.
MORE
Helmet boy origins is backk. 😂
PLEASE do this with a camera on them so you can see the person in the helmets face as they turn around
The best video that laghed so much on but the best bit of all was at 8:45
ethan's slap at 5:25 made me choke on my food lol that was out of pocket ethan lol
guys it’s helmet boy!
we really just watched men slap each other’s heads for 9 mins
The return of helmet boy
This is an Indian game that we've been playing since our childhood, but we did it without the helmet, probably vikk's idea😂
So good
The title of the video should have been “giving vikkstar a concussion”
Simon's looking really good with that beard !!!!!
Students in Indian classrooms play this game everyday
Simple things.  More content!
This is the lowest effort highest quality of content 😭😭😂😂😂😂
I just saw it tomorrow on a short and they did it in thier channel
they should do SIDEMEN BACK GAME where they do the same thing but on their backs. They beat on one person's back and they have to guess who it is.
Do the one where every one is blind folded and you have beat the shit out of others in the room. With pillow or soft object ofc
it's literally 9 minutes of josh just slapping the absolute crap out oh the Side Men
The one time vik hit some one he got picked 💀
LMAOOOO, this gave me Helium Challenge Vibes, like back in the day. I KNEW Harry was gonna kick someone in the head, LMAOOOOOOO.
We need more of this game is mad funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
JJ looking clean in those hairs
Yesssssssss!
Vik ain't gonna be the same after this lol
The day they all lost a few IQ points😂

That is hands down my favourite video ever, I never laughed that good and much for ages, 😂🙌
How can something so simple be so hilarious 😂🤣

I'M SOOO WAITING FOR THEM TO DO THIS SHIT 😂😂😂😂 CAN'T STOP LAUGHING MY GUTS OUT 🤣
Can we all appreciate the fact that Tobi hit Vik softly so that he would be able to guess it’s him. Big up mah g
Reminds me of the good old days. I reckon this'll be a video we come back to when the boys quit
vik's part is the funniest 😭😭
I haven't laughed this much in AGES this was amazing.  Definitely reminds me of the old days
Poor Vik getting concussed because he can’t even get one guess right 😂
JJ's having a bit too much fun lmao
Bruh Vikk was on the verge of tearing up by the end, they got too carried away lol 😢😭
My abdomen hurts because of how much I laughed
This video was jokes😂😂
I saw this on Instagram and wanted SIDEMEN to do it and they did it awww this was so funny
Best vid so far😭😭
Helmet. Boi
8:18 Are we not going to talk about Harry giving a free kick to Vik's head HAHAHAHAHAH
This might be my favorite sidemen video
Man how didn't vik guess that ksi would be the first one hitting him? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just rename this to “the sidemen laughing for 9 minutes” and it’s still the same video.
Best sidemen video ever😂😂😂 had me screaming for 10 mins straight 😂😂😂
4:40 Ethan having a itch
Why was this actually so funny💀
This could have been the shortest and funniest sidemen sunday of all time!!!
How to entertain grown ass men🤣
I want more of this please
My top 5 picks🤣 5:25 6:37 7:07 8:19 8:38

Great content even by doing the simplest shit 😂
Great content even by doing the simplest shit 😂
Bangin vid! Pls do this with Filly Chunkz and HP!
Real sidemen ogs know when vik had the helmet on I instally said HELMET BOY ORGINS
my head hurts after watching this 🤣🤣
More
We need at part 2
Why does vik look like a deliveroo rider 😂
this is legit one of the best sidemen videos there ever made
Why do i feel like vik knew everyone who slapped him but picked someone else. When he got hit hard he first turned to the person who hit him then picked another
I think Ethan's face at 5:27 was the best part for me 😂😂😂
#StopVikkAbuse
We need more of these
Why do u do it with a helmet on
7:13 you alright there JJ? Not to mention the umpteen weird laughs you did!
10 minutes of laughing and hitting a helmet. the best 10 minutes of my life 😭
I’m literally crying laughing so hard fuck need 20 more of these
I'm crying
Harry kicking was MAD😂
In India, we play this game without helmet and it is so much fun.
When Harry kicked  vik 💀
Definition of "boys will be boys" lmaooo
Omg
I think Vik lost brain cells
More of these stupid funny minigames please :D!
Josh actually has a big head 😂
I used to play this game when i was in school. And at the end someone ended up with crying. This game is so much fun. But we play this without helmet. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
9 mins?????? bro
Just pure epicness 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ladz it seems like a bunch of school bullies are bullying vikk
Vik didn't want to slap again after that
THIS MUST BE ONE OF THE BEST MORESIDEMEN VIDEO I’VE EVER SEEN
😂😂🤣
part 2
i dont think ive ever laughed at a more sidemen video like that ever holy shittttt I'm fucking cryinggggg
Hey
hopefully, this didn't take too much of a toll on the guys. let's be honest not too much of a toll on  Vik, because this would be awesome if they were to do a part 2
Best video I’ve ever witnessed of these lot 🤣
I swear they look like the genuinely had a good time making this video 😂
The general opinion that zerkaa is the boring one is nonsense. He's absolutely savage. This video the speed dating one and the new year video are small examples 😂😂. He is definately entertaining
best video
LMFAO THE WHOLE VIDEO 🤣🤣😂😂
Need more video like this!!!!
There's having your finger on the pulse of whats popular, then there's ripping off an idea thats good for a 15secomd tiktok forced into a 15min video.. cmon guys you might be surrounded by yes men but I'll tell you you can do better
first vid thats made me cry laughing in a bit this shit was h i l a r i o u s
This was so fucking funny!!😂😂
Bro this is the funniest challenge. Please do this again!
Best sidemen video i have ever watched😭
Love how Ethan asks vik if he’s ok after ❤️❤️
Wait us that how jj broke his hand?? Cause I know they recorded that a will ago. And on Chris's bitcoin video they said wait until you find out how (and everyone was laughing)
What a great video
Best video ever !!!!!
Now this is classic sidemen content
Bullying Vik lads?  XDXDXD
Imo, These would be as entertaining as a Sidemen Sunday
This is the only way you can bully Vik now and get away with it 😂😂😂
I genuinely felt bad for vikk
Vikstar boyy , buy a good connection..ur lagging way lott
what a gem of a video omg, i couldnt stop laughing
This was amazing 🤣
Haven’t giggled this much in awhile lads🤣🤣
We want a part 2  of this.  Cause this is like the moo off.  It's nothing hard to do but it's funny  genuinely
WE NEED MORE OF THESE!!!
HOLY THIS WAS FUNNY
This is such a simple idea, but also such a good video!🤣🔥
5:25 I'm actually dying of laughter! My stomach hurts!
Vik took one for the people
Damn this shit is funny lol
Vik was not ready to risk getting caught after the start
Vid genuinely looked like he was getting brain damage🤣
JJ LAUGH HEAL MY PAIN LOL🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:15 lol
Anjir nyampe sidemen main ginian hahahaha
this deserves to be the most viewed moresidemen video of all time
Stop vik abuse
How was Vik struggling that much? I thought he was Helmet Boy
we just watched 30y olds mans slapping they head for ten minutes straight
idk what’s worse, the lads running out of ideas to a point that this is what it’s come to or me, a 24 year old female, finding a lot of humor in lads getting slapped with a helmet on their heads
Mtdf
I pissed myself like 6 times 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm watching this at 3AM and officially woken up my entire family from laughing LOL. Need more vid's like this
girls:his probably cheating on me with another girl the boys:
JJ scream-laughing the entire video through is the funniest shit
Alright. The part at 8:30-8:50 where JJ hits Vic needs to break the internet. 😂😂😂
I just died laughing watching 6 dudes slap a guy’s head. The sidemen has truly peaked.
Moresdmn 10mil?
Thought the lads were getting their knobs out for a vid 😭😭

trying not to wake the house up rn 💀
I just wanna appreciate how Tobi was with vikk throughout the video it’s so wholesome

Helmet boy origins
Tears 🤣🤣🤣
I was literally thinking “has Vik slapped anyone yet?” And then he just fuckin whales one on whoever it was in the chair 😂😂

Vicc getting the violated by men!!
5:25 LMAO

helium challenge vibes
WE WANT MORE LIKE THIS
Best video of 2022 I can watch this for an hour straight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

It's always good seeing harry genuinely laugh...
I swear Simon said the n word at 8:48 😂
Best sidemen video of the month
Why does it looks so funny when Josh is wearing the helmet, his head literally becomes this 🟧
Absolute classic!
The vik one was the funniest 😂

#stopvikabuse 😂😂😂
Dude🤣
This gives me old sidemen house vibes 😂
Vik is gonna need to go through some physical therapy now
LOVED THIS😂😂😂
I've rewatched this 4 times in the last 4 hours 😂😂
Vik fully gets Builled in these vids
This video should be titled "sidemen laughing for 9:46
I haven't seen Simon laugh this hard since the camping vid with Gib & Harry in the golf cart with the bottle of water 😂
My cheeks hurt…. My stomach hurts…. The amount of brain cells lost in this video hurt…. And most importantly laughing so hard for 10 minutes straight isn’t good for my health….
STOP VIKK ABUSE
I'm happy that hockey culture has been induced into regular games and some of the things aren't even known to be hockey
This is so ironic for me cause today I received a concussion for doing a jump while skiing all without a helmet. Oh the irony 😂 Life in Canada 🇨🇦
it’s 2:44 here and i’m crying at laugh
I'm doing this with my m8s
I haven’t laughed this much in ages 😂😂😂😂😂
😭😭😭😭😭
8:38

#stopvickabuse🤣🤣
BIIIIIG point game vibes, we need a sequel
I was smiling so much that my jaw started to hurt😂
vik abuse again

So simple but so effective your guys laughter had me creasing 🤣
the most unscripted video ever
9:36 JJ looked gutted when vik got it right lmao
This shit had me weak 🤣🤣🤣
Why tf is this so funny... lmfao
I beg do this again but everyone has to wear a heller with a gopro so that WE can see the reactions when they turn around
reminds me sm of old sidemen videos where you’d do challenges like this, pure nostalgia
Okay, so that’s not how helmets work. You’re still in danger of a concussion even with head gear on. It’s not the hit, it’s the movement of your head. The helmet is worn to make up for the fact that your skull isn’t very hard, so you don’t turn into a broken egg on the road.   However, this was hilarious so please continue to give each other brain damage in a part two.
this video is up there alongside tinder 3. We need more of those
reminds me sm of old sidemen videos where you’d do challenges like this, pure nostalgia
this need to be a new series ; i m literally in tears
im dyinnnnn
8:38 that one autistic kid in class 😂😂😂😂😂
Again one of those wholesome SIDEMEN videos. Ah, CLASSIC!!
I was doing this in middle school on every break with friends, only we had no helmet so it was even more fun
Simple but funny love it ❤😂
Xbox > Playstation
Simón: hits hard everybody *JJ's turn* Simon: *loves tap jj*
this was more entertaining than most sidemen videos nowadays
Ethan slapped Harry’s head into 3rd gear😂
THE RETURN OF ELMET BOY
Jeez it’s only January and they’ve already  made the best video for 2022
Need more plis!! 😂😂
Bro JJ was shaking his hand in pain and Vik still got it wrong 😂
S tier video if I'm being honest 😂
Definitely one of my top 5 more sidemen vids
Damn i hope when they be old they still make crazy videos until get an award
Class video 😂😭😂
This video is golden dang haven’t laughed like that in a while lol
This was hilarious 😆
I LAUGHED SO HARD WHEN JOSH PUT IT ON HAHAHAHAHAHAAH
#StopVikkAbuse 🤣🤣

😭
#StopVikkAbuse2022
I’ve got Covid and this made my day😅😅
#stopvikabuse
Vikk was fighting for his life here 😂
Ik this is a game but vik is so fucking clueless😅
they gotta do this again but right after pub golf
Indians know this game very well 🤣
To think when I was a child I would play this without a helmet
I havent laughed this hard in a long time
I shit you not… saw this game scrolling through Instagram 2 days ago and thought you guys would do it 🤣 Didn’t expect it so soon after finding it though 🙌🏼
JJ: i have an idea and vikk gets to be in the hot seat first
Goatef
This had me in tears
SidePlus is $2 per month *more* expensive than Disney+, and for Brits it's still only around £1 less per month (since for some reason Disney+ is more expensive in the UK and Europe). How can they honestly expect us to pay that for boring ass BTS shit when theres already been plenty of BTS stuff on Kon's channel for free, podcast eps that have like 3-4 of the boys each when Simon and Randolph already have a free podcast and all of these guys besides JJ and Ethan also stream (some stream quite regularly as well)? If it also included every singke Sidemen & MoreSidemen censored moment then maybe it'd be worth like £3-5 per month but as is SidePlus shouldn't even cost £2 per month honestly. MoreSidemen and even SidemenReacts are far better content
this was such a good video, honestly the sidemen could upload an hour long laugh track and it would be great
Honestly the funniest sidemen video i think I've watched, pain=funny i guess 😂
#STOPVIKKABUSE
Bring the moo off back please
Bro this video was so wholesome and funny definitely need more of these
It's 2022 and jj still bullying vikk
This is actually one of the funniest videos I’ve watched in so long
Plz do this again 😂😂😂😂
this was acc hilarious   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i've got to do this with my friends
4:40 JJ was so sweet to his GF He doesn’t want seeing his GF get hurt.
Hilarious
This was too funny, my ribs hurt 🤣🤣
Love how they ended it with Vikk cos they thought he’d last long again after the first time lmao.
This video WILL blow up!
The original helmet boy origins
Rivers of tears, never had anything like that. I need atleast 87 more of these. I wanna die watching one of these
Bullying Vik. 2022 and it never gets old.
Part 2?😂
This is the true essence of the sidemen. I love the high production stuff but THIS is true sidemen
this bangs
Where do I claim the chain at? I can’t find it
Actually crying! 😂😂😂😂
We need more videos like this 🤣🤣🤣🤣😹😹
1:37 naahhh that's the point where i just died
It would’ve been more funny if everyone slapped someone in the chair at the same time 🤣🤣🤣
This shit is innovative and funny. Their laughs make it more better XD XD XD
Vik’s face on 6:58 🤣🤣
The perfect example that they don't need to make an hour long videos to be great entertainment
Hahaha this is the perfect try to keep a straight face challenge
Main channel vid for an hour 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maaateeesss we want more but longer
I’m shittin myself 😂😂😂
This honestly the funniest shit ive ever seen im ther sitting in my bed dying from laughing i dont usually laugh out loud on videos when im alone but this got me fucking dying i need a part 2
Poor vik man just got destroyed in that
Honestly one of the simplest but funniest videos ive seen in a long time
Funniest video ever. Couldn't stop laughing.
Helmet boy back at it
8:37 I love that laugh from JJ 😂😂
This is the funniest video never laughed this much
Oh bro 😂
I was expecting it to be Vik for 10 mins
8:48 Simon you naughty boy
Vikk struggling is so funny to watch 😂 Banger video idea 🔥
I never laughed at videos or anything but i was dieing with this video 😂
One of the best vids ever I’m actual tears crying
This needs to be annual like the moo off
Never laughed so painfully hard 😂😂😂
Vik straight got bullied 😂 I feel bad for him lol
Helmet boy got abused!! 😂
The best 10 minutes of my life.
The concept of the helmet game was very strange, but it was hilarious
I thought Vik was gonna do a pacifist run, after what he experienced. Haha.
7hrs before they all said jj bullies vik  Now the whole sidemen bullies him🤭
we’re watching these guys just slap each other for ten minutes and it’s one of the most hilarious videos I’ve seen in a while
Bro poor Vik, just got the absolute piss slapped out of him!!!😂
absolutely unreal
I think vik got brain damage at 8:49, man voted twice 💀💀💀
This is so funny
Do another one plz it’s jokesss😂
Ofc helmet boy was 1st
Finally jj’s hair is down
Helmet boy origins mate😭😭
This was just 10 mins of the sidemen laughing😂
It's a simple concept but definitely a golden one haven't had a good laugh in a while
Yes I missed these simple type of challenges (HELMET BOI VIK IS BACK)
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i think i almost laught thru out the whoal video
The start reminded me so much of Jackass, just straight to the point 😂😭
This video gives me silent library vibes 😂

This is the best video the sidemen have ever done
What a video mates, ABSOLUTE BANGER!!
Haven’t laughed so much in 10 minutes my Hole life

This takes me straight back to patiens test days, such a hilarious video really love to see more of this!
What's with simons new look?
That was boss 🤣🤣
Is it was about 5 minutes of Vikk abuse with JJ laugh track in the background running for 10 minutes straight
#stopthevikabuse

I'll put it simply LOL 😆😂😂
Who even thought of this idea 😭🤣🤣
Ayo Tobi watcha grabbin there bud...6:08

this is jokes, i'm crying 😂😂😂😂
#StopVikAbuse
Vik held that like a champ!!! Like a bigg champ... But what a laugh start to finish.. absolute killer.
We need like 20 min of sidemen n the close boys to do this with 2 in the helmet
how many ads u man wanna put on
After that Round Vik Never Slap Again xD 2:35
They were killing vik in the beginning😭
Can't stop laughing u are guys are the best make my day
Vik definitely lost a few brain cells 😂
How can she slap
Bro Ethan’s face at 5:27 absolutely killed me bro 😂😂😂
They should do this again... but much longer😂
Imaging vik going to the boys like hey this would be a great video only to spend the first quarter of it getting yeeted
bro 5:28 is so funny ethans face cracks me up
Vik is lookin like a uber eats dude in that helmet
If I was to pick an initial winner from this video, it would be JJ as he only ended up in the helmet once.
only on moresidemen
they are genuinely in tears lol I love it
This was hilarious!
I havent laughed 10 minutes straight in ages til now. Banger video🤣🤩
I honestly could not stop laughing😂😂
FUNNIEST SHIT I've seen this year

Sidemen Becomes Chickens for 10 Minutes
#STOPVIKABUSE XD
...banger
This reminds me of the water ballon video from the old days
weirdly, this is sidemen at their finest, just pure laughter and mates having a laugh🤣
We need an Ethan Cam for this one
I wasn't able to breathe
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was amazing to watch
They should've played this on the Silent Library
Ay yo we men are just so simple creatures I swear to god 😂😂
Btw it’s my birthday
6:37 I spat my coffee
This game is the end of the sidemen! LOL
this woulda been a main channel vid a few years back
#stopvikabuse2022 lol
i can sleep happy now
8:38 vik lacks all common sense
At this point sidemen should really do the blindfolded pillow fight
Hear me out!! Do another one but with the beta squad!!!
Vik's IQ will never be the same
😂😂😂
Vic was a victim 😭
Broo vik😂😂😂😂
Tobi and Ethan in sync with that silent laugh lmao 8:15
They are running out of ideas for this channel
I think they ran out of ideas to make a video lol and they just found this
Make it into a annual game
Vik threw 2 punches 🥲
This is gold:))))))
Just played this with my mates the same day as this video was uploaded and I gotta say this game is jokes for no reason 😂 good laugh.
Holy shit I haven't laughed that hard in ages lmao
Ksi laugh is just amazing
Helmet boy origins
alternative title: Lets BUlly Vik
✨Oh no….my humour… it’s broken ✨  I’m crying, why was this so funny to me
I thought this would be hard to watch but they added the personality into it
When I started the video I thought nah this is not it, but it was the funniest video had me laughing all the way
No American YouTuber or anyone in fact has made me laugh that hard and long
Am I tripping or at 7:58 does a weird voice say "wrong"
We have a game in Italy that is called the slap of the soldier that is just like this and this brought back so many childhood memories :)
funniest shit ever
Lol at school we usually play this with out the helmet. And if u try to quit u receive 20 from everyone play. Africa man 😆

Ethans face when he’s trying not to laugh 😂
4:14 yo this is a smack

Josh has no idea how lucky he was to avoid Harry's impending round house kick at 7:55
İ would have died if it was nine minutes of Vik being slapped and never manage to find the one xD
Only real ones are here before 1mil views
For some reason them getting smacked in the head is the funniest thing ever.
3:16 the way harry turns around and points at just without saying anything is way too funny for no reason ☠️☠️☠️
Need more stuff like this
At 8:39 has to be my favourite moment when jj hits and realises how much it actually hurt
I could watch 30 minutes of this 😂😂😂

Me and my cousins use to play this game without helmet, when we were kids 😭  What a throwback
ethan’s face gave it away so many times but he still got away with it😭

#stopvikabuse
Hilarious 😂
This was the funniest thing ive ever seen
Tommy T wants all the smoke 😭😭
why was this the funniest video in a long time
84 % of this video is there someone laughing
That is definitely the best more sidemen video in 2022 January 😂😂
Vik was that guy at school that whenever someone tapped his shoulder from the opposite side he’d always look at the shoulder that was being tapped and never think it was the opposite side
You should a silent one of these 😭😭
whys vik so kind
JJ IS LITERALLY LAUGHING TILL HE CRIES🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was the funniest video I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂

Slapping vik was like slapping the bald black kid in school with the fresh haircut
Only the sidemen could make it this funny
the level of stupidity, yet here i am watching it and laughing my ass off!
Ahahaha about time they did this
Y was this so funny 😂
#stopvikabuse
i wanna do this
Lol saw Simon look at guy behind camera to pick which one haha fair play
They should definitely do another one! But maybe this time you’re all wearing cups and you have to guess which of the guys is tickling your balls!!
IM IN TEARS LMFAOAOAOA
the fact that these challenges need almost no preparation or work to do is funny, the way everyone laughs every second for slapping the other's head is already stupidly hilarious!    Edit: I realized a lot of ya'll don't get my opinion but basically I just commented this for myself, so I changed it, hope you're happy
Can’t believe harry kicked vik 😂😂😂! That’s outrageous 😂😭
This was a sidmen old school class op video lmao so so so so much
Someone needed a video to post… yikes

This is making me cry with laughter😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolute fucking jokes 😂
Part 2 with cal and chunkz and that
this isn't the real game, the real game is without a helmet 😂😂

#STOPVIKKABUSE

You can see vik getting more and more brain damaged as this video progresses🤣
Harry is outta pocket for kicking Vikk 💀
I am convinced this whole game is just a way for them to bring back "bully vik"
This is the hardest, I have laughed after so long 😂😂😂
The video literally began at 0:00... fastest intro ever...   Also why is this so fucking funny...
Before I watch this I already know Vic will be bullied
I laughed till I cried..lol
This is actually hilarious
3:15 - 3:17  Josh lasted two seconds. Sorry Freya

#StartVikAbuse

i haven’t laughed this hard in a while
you can tell it isn't ethan because he laughs at every hit that isn't his😂
So good i had to watch it twice
Vikk’s brain is overrated
As someone who gets migraines this would suck but it was definitely funny
Alternative Title: SIDEMEN BULLYING VIK

10 min of laughing. Love the video
7 blokes in a room slapping heads, sounds like Simons Saturday night 👸
Vik figured it was Tobi both times when he received a light hit. Tobi doesnt have a mean bone in hes body.
My jaw hurts
Fookin elmet boi returns
Behz was on smoke lamo😂
They should make this annual like the moo off was
Jokes
This was hilarious. Also, big up to Tobi to get Vik outta the situation twice by hitting him gently to let him know. My guy

#Stop Vikk Abuse 😪
This is top tier
Everyone was bullying Vik . Sidemen Sunday: sidemen are Viks assistant for 24h

JJ's hair is so sick like this

Please do this again
Vik back to helmet boy origins love to see it
#StopVikAbuse
This is jokes
please do more of this
Why are the most simply made videos the most entertaining ones?
8:49 what did Simon say
dude im not even joking. me and my friends invented this game like 3 weeks ago. it was a little different because we didnt have a helmet and the person getting hit and also guessing was sitting at a desk with his head down xD so much fun tho
Just them laughing throughout the whole video lol
If they do another silent library this should be one of the things they have to do
I’m sad the video isn’t longer, but I’m also worried about Vikk’s brain 😂😂
Make it annual game show its jokes
Half the video is bullying on vik
This reminds me of there old videos it is like a old video with a new twist
Why is Ethan grabbing his junk throughout the entire video?!😂
trying to watch the sidemen, while tryin to eat spaghetti is like trying to catch a chicken. IMPOSSIBLE
Ethans face at 7:02 is priceless
Way too funny!
This literally has no reason to be funny, but it’s hilarious 😂😭
Old school and awesome
This is Actually so good. We'll done
Anyone else wanna see the patience test sgain
Im sad he didnt say: "its helmet boy mate".
ksi out there  looking like the walmart version of bob marley
My tears started i laugh so hard
This is so entertaining😂😂😂😂😂😂
4:40 I think Ethan has a secret fetish
This ones a banger😭😂😂😂😂
Short and sweet.
Vic has no idea🤣
THISI S THE MOST I HAVE LAUGHED IN MONTHS THANK U

It'd be even funnier if there was a back shot (pause) so we could see the hittee's facial expressions
HELMETBOYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fuck yes
2:10 jj laughs like a damn haunted door
Oh my days XD
More of this!!!
Incredible!
It’s almost as if Josh and Ethan have been waiting their whole lives to slap the boy across the head 😂😂
I didnt laugh this much on  a video
Best Video on the MoreSidemen Channel without a doubt!
yo josh needs to relax lol
They remind me of minions hitting each other and laughing 😂😂😂
give me more of this
Old sidemen vibes, love it!
My head hurt from laughing ahahah
short but sweet
HELMET BOY RETURNS
bruh, almost 10 minutes of laughing histerically, because me and my mates would play a version of this game where one put his hand with the back on the opposite shoulder and the other blocking their view and i swear a dude that was a karate blackbelt who faught in international competitions did a flykick once. this is the best kind of fun with your mates.
Best 9.45 minutes in my LIFE. My god, Im dead 😂
Why is the funniest video on the channel this to me? It's so silly and I love it 🤣
Simple but effective🤣🤣🤣🤣
Part 2? Full body armour?
Okay thisss but you have to take a shot before you put the helmet on 😂🤣🙏🏼
I be seeing this stuff on tiktok thanks for the laughs boys
My jaws hurt from constantly laughing i fucking cant😂😂
8:38 JJ struggling to keep it in, smashing vik and just losing it😂
Bro best video ever, I laughed the whole time and now my head hurts
in  W2S's fine words... what a shithouse
Ain’t laughed this hard in a hot minute
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this may not have been high production but it was funny enough to be a main channel video
in zambia we play this game without a helmet🤣😂
That was genuinely the most I have laughed allll week😂😂😂😂
As Verstappen would say “Simply Lovely”
It's so dumb that I'd happily watch a half hour version of this 😂
Video was literally a banger 😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
2:14 JJ's laugh is like a cranking door 😂😂
this was one of the funniest videos you guys made
when the sidemen stole the game of tiktok lmfao
Please do this with the crew next, feel like that would be GOLD
9:52 LOLLL
I can't breathe 🤣🤣🤣
Shortest video in a while
This is just a couple of dudes slapping each other on the head why is this soooo funny😂😂😂😂I'm dying
Vikk had a better chance at just guessing one person the whole time 😂
Damn poor Hitstarr
wow, I laughed my knee caps off 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel bad for Vik, it’s not fun being the one everyone makes fun of
Pause at 6:57 perfect thumbnail
This is legendary
This is no doubt the funniest sidemen video 😂😂
I don't know what Josh has against the rest of the Sidemen, but whatever it is, its personal.
❤️❤️❤️
Harry’s laugh. 😂😂
Funniest video I’ve seen in a long time. Pretty much battering each other in turns😂😂
I almost threw up from laughing so much

Simple but effective content
This is hilarious, poor vik 🤣😂
Tobi with a helmet is genuinely the best thing ever
Literally incredible
5:28 me after Taco Bell
This was the dumbest thing I've ever seen but also the funniest 🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:55 Vikk went for it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
In theory, this video is a lazy, terribly edited, abomination of a video.  In practice, it is a surprisingly enjoyable video, which can be described as a 'barrel of laughs'.
That was jokes 🤣
The whole 10 mins i was crying man😂😂😂
That was so funny 😂 i really enjoyed it 😂😂
#stopvikabuse
More sidemen more!. But with bigger steaks next time!
The best 9 minutes 46 of my life

When the smartest Sidemen getting confused for an entire 9.46 video 😂 Vikstar123
This is funny I was watching another version of this in YouTube shorts last day

It’s all fun until Vik is on the chair. I feel bad for him man 😭😂
Genuinely the most I've ever laughed out loud at a YouTube video in a long time 😂
One of the funniest video ever
The fast paced ones of this game is eliteee
Vik used to be the smartest sideman
I fucking died when Harry kicked Vik 💀
I feel like it's a #StopVikAbuse 😂😂
Helmet Boy Funny Moments (GONE WRONG?)
Supposed to do this without helmet
jj's hair yoooo
Helmet boy origin is back only old school fans knows why we call vikkstar that. Only the sidemen can make a simple thing to be super funny. So i'm guessing tomorrow is the hide and seek challenge in that house
This reminds me of Vikk abuse
Again again
The way the game works is u not supposed to wait in-between hits u turn around the min u get hit
Fuck me this was gold 😂😂😂
5:26 that was one of the best things I’ve ever seen
I didn't expect to laugh so hard.
I spent 9:45 minutes of straight laughter, oh my gosh, this is the greatest video ever
This is their funniest video ever😂😂
Crazy how this was more entertaining than sidemen sunday
someone make JJ’s laugh into the iron man thing again

5:28 Ethan’s face priceless
Holy shit, I just laughed for 9 minutes straight 😂

That was funny ^_^
This video is gold 😂
JJ's face after slapping 08:37

Tobi Never hit hard and he hit so soft that vikk knew who hit him haha what a good guy
I’ve never laughed more in my life than seeing Vick be almost half the video
https://youtu.be/mGcmi4hftCg
This is funny
FUN KNEE
More more of these !!!!!!!!
My throat is killing me rn 😅😅😂😅😅😅
Funniest video you guys have ever done
I've seen this somewhere else before. I think they did it without the helmel, and they did it with spoons. No hard, but a tap on top of the head hurts...
This was definitely Harry’s idea
Vikk really have evolved into the real helmet boi.
And then there was the Helmet Slap videos for the next year Well Done Boys!
Part 2 I would like to see
Ive never been so entertained in my life and when u realise you’re just watching grown men hit their friends with a helmet on makes it even more funny
This is the most I’ve laughed in ages please do this again
OMG!!! This was soooooo hilarious do this more guys!
When I first saw this, it immediately made me think of Vik’s super indestructible helmet from GTA 😂
Bullying Vick at its finest
CTE GAME IS SO MUCH FUN 🤪
Sheeeet had me dying
Vik abuse is to funny
This is absolutely hilarious, I’d imagine it would be hard to sound camp with the helmet on tho
Lmao 😂
My whole body hurts from laughing so much 😂
These guys make the best content i swear
3:15 the way harry turns and points like a robot hahaha
I wouldnt mind an hr of this for a sidemen sunday haha
After this #stopvimabuse needs to be brought back
Wait to get that chain can I buy a month of sideplus and get it in the US? or is it like a giveaway or something
JJ definitely took ecstasy before this
I saw this idea on TikTok.. you guys are quick too jump on something 😂😂 simple and amazing
Harry's one was funny 😂😂

Reason 7425th why women live longer than men
The best video ever, never stop laughing

This video gives me old sidemen vibes and it's exactly what I want to see more of!
Sidemen: slaps helmet  In 2 hours: half a Mil views 👌
#stopvikabuse
#stopvikabuse
The only way vik could get out of the chair is if Tobi hits. Because he was the only one who didn't hit that hard.
Would love to see this but with a boxing glove
😂
I've just watched grown men slap each other and it made my day.😂😂🤣🤣
Irl helmet boy
idk why its fun to see people get slapped 😂
Sidemen playing this drunk will be beefy
Loving JJ's long hair
Whens part 2 abahahah
WHY IS JOSHS HEAD SO SQUARE WITH THAT HELMET, I'M DYING XDD
Ethan`s face after the 5:25 slap... priceless. New meme needed.
Alternative title: Sidemen laughing for 9:45
9:00 stop vick abuse
My head hurts from laughing to tears!! hilarious
This is the new moo off
8:39 that laugh from jj killed me bro😂
I was today years old when I learnt if you laugh for more than 9mins non stop your face fucking hurts

This vid will go down in history🔥
Its only right that the 'Helmet Boy' wear it the longest
Yo what have I just watched. I just watched people slap someone’s head for 10 min and laughed the whole time 😂
So simple bit im crying 😭
Jj had a year long laugh comp in the first 30 seconds
“The Return Of Helmet Boy”
Best more sideman video since harry breakdown in fifa
OMG the best 10 mins laughing like crazy 😂😂
Most simple video concept ever. I loved the entire 10 mins. 🤣🤣🤣
Oi I couldn’t stop laughing we need more 😂❤️
This was the funniest one ever
This was hilarious, make it a yearly thing
Grown men laughing at hitting helmets…The Life
I don’t think I’ve belly laughed this hard for a while
This has the same energy as the moo offs
Did anyone notice that jj helped Simon on his turn and rat off Harry? Ksi simping for Simon 🖤
Bro Sidemen just made my day
Yo this is the content that we want Like if u agree guys
One of the funniest videos 😭😭😭😭
We need to see another one without the helmet
#stopvikkabuse 😂😂😂
How is this so funny? 🤣🤣🤣
This was WAY TOO FUNNY
My stomach hurts from all the laughing 😂
So sad we didn’t get an old school “ELMET BOY” from Vik:/ great video tho😂
“Sidemen Slap Vikk for 8 minutes” is a better title
Alternative title - Slapping Vikstarr123 for 5 minutes.
This is goated.
Who came here from tiktok
Oddly wholesome how much fun they had
literally crying laughing for 10 mins straight omg
#STOPVIKABUSE
#stopVikkAbuse
Either Vic was getting concussed or he was getting pissed low key lmao
OMG THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA
fuuniest video yet
Vikk is so shit at this that it's amazing
Funniest 9 minutes of my life
This is what saves our days. Grown up men hitting each other in the head and laughing.
Alright now imagine this... but the sidemen are drunk
1:22 that was a very Harry slap, i wouldve said him too 😭
vik only slapped twice and got caught once lol
in south africa we play with no helmat
the whole video is just them laughing XD
That was so fking funny, im crying
First time I've seen Josh laugh that hard lmao
Where do I get the side+ exclusive chain if I'm a side+ member does anybody know

In Serbia, we play it without the helmet bro xD
PLEASE DO A PART TWO SO WHEN ITS SOMEONES TURN YOU SAY THEY GUEST WRONG EVERY TIME, EVEN IF THEY GOT IT CORRECT
Vic bullying back for 2022. 🤣🤣
ive been dying this whole video just stupid fun!
this reminds me of old sidemen videos, a simple concept but fucking hilarious
I firmly believe that Josh’s dad is part of the EDL and that’s why he had a vendetta against vik
needs a part 2
What a fucking banger😂😂😂😂
I love how Harry guessed it was jj when he got slammed
When Simon didn’t even slap Ethan but full on pushed his head had me laughing 6:38
should've done this one in silent library
this may be the greatest video out there 🤣
JJ had the most fun here
yo I feel bad for vik he got destroyed🏥
I bet this is what they do in their free time...  they just give Vik some armor and beat him up.
I was genuinely laughing with tears in my eyes till the last minute😂
NEXT WITH SPECIAL GUESTS
Only OGs remember helmet boy
The only reason Vik knew it was Tobi is because he's the only one he knows won't slap the shit out of him lmao
Best moresidemen vid in While
so funny😂
5:27 are you alright there Ethan, that looked like it hurt * his facial expression* 😂🤣
Incredible 😂
paaaaaaart 2 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vik barely slapped because he was too scared to be in the hot seat again
Another installment but it’s crew and the troops
It's always the simple games or challenges that don't require all the money and planning and rules that r the best.
Low effort, still a banger
Legit one of the funniest Sidemen vids ever. What a great concept
This vid had me finished
I laughed my way through the whole video 😂😂😂😂😂😂
THIS IS THE GREATEST MORESIDEMEN VIDEO  IM FUCKING CRYIING 😂🤣🤣
I really hope this vid pops the fck off so we get another one 🤣🤣
Ethan reactions are priceless
STOP VIK ABUSE!!!

Sidemen: running out of ideas, Also Sidemen: slap each other in the head for 10 minutes
ROFL I have no idea why this was so funny but I DIED LAUGHING 😂

This has become my favourite video of moresidemen😂😂😂😂😂
This whole video is just grown men giggling at each other and I’m LIVING for it
I'm just thinking about Aliens watching us and this is what they see 😂
the title should be: 6 OF THE SIDEMEN DOES RUSIAN ROULETTE BUT WITH A HELMET
#stopvikabuse
this was amazing lmao
Shit is comedy
This could possibly be one of the best videos they’ve made
#bringbackvikabuse should've been the title with how long he was in the chair 😂😂
This is so funny 😂😂

No Indian was harm during this video.

JJ should wear his hair like that more often, it looks more natural than the Pineapple head cut lol
This video idea was the best, that they ever Came Up with it, I was literally crying and My ribs was hitting my body, Just laughing at the hits of the Helment that each of them took from each other.
KSI didn't even go crazy with this I'm surprised he has grown so much 😭
Helmet boy origins 😂
Josh’s hitting is a bit aggressive tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️
JJ looking like Predator with that hair
An hour of this would be great for a sidemen Sunday 😂
Can’t believe harry kicked vik 😂😂😂! That’s outrageous 😂😭
Yoo ksi is quite hot with his hair like that
just like good old days
Hilarious 😂😂
my word the sidemen dont have half produce some stinky videos for how much they could do
Never laughed so much in my entire life 😂😂😂😂 what a simple concept but unbelievable execution
Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best this video was awesome and hilarious to watch!!!
I honestly wouldn’t be mad if this went up on the main channel

7:01 ethans face after that slap LMAO

This video is just the sidemen giving Vik a concussion and laughing their asses off 🤣🤣
Please do this with Callux 😭😂
Do one wit jme
Haven't laughed like this in a long time
You guys never fail to entertain us.
It would have been 10x more funnier than what it already is if they just kept on slapping the living shit out of him
#stopvikkabuse 😂😂😂😂😂
I love how you can see Harry`s leg twitching as he wanted to kick Josh`s head, but god said: "wait, thats not the usual victim?" and put vik there
im dyin
Saw this on tiktok time ago, just waiting for someone to actually use it for content and here the side men are providing the best content
Vikks tactic was if he never hits, then he will never need to sit down with the hemlet
This is one of my funniest videos you’ve done 😂😂😂
Vik Helmet boi origins
Yoww ethan was goin personal XDD
Now this is entertainment
At least vikk got his helmet on
You could just call the video "bullying vikstar"
This needs to be the new sidemen moo off but instead of yearly do it monthly 😂😂😂
#LNF
Banger idea
moo off vibes
#stopvikkabuse
Old sidemen vibes man
This video is top tier I’ve never laughed so much so quickly
Return of Helmut Boy
lmao my mom thought i was choking on my food from laughing

It good to see All of Them laugh Together 😂👍
We gotta see another one of these with guests, absolute gold 💯
My mouth hurt from smiling and laughing 😂😂
Ayo wheres part 2? Yall gotta have a part 2 honest 2 god ( you could wack each other with like example a ping pong racket or something just for extra chaos)
I love how these guys can take a simple game and make It into such pure gold

WE NEED MORE THIS WAS HILARIOUS
We need a pt2 tomorrow and 30 mins long!

I've never laughed so hard in my entire life😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
ive never laughed at a vid more
This might be better than the moo off😂
This game is basically Abusing the Helmet Guy 😆😂
funniest vid ever
The purpose of this video, is them smacking each other head with the helmet on to lose their brain cell.
Nice.
Some says vik is still finding who hit me 😂
next video: the sidemen do lice treatment!
I could not stop laughing lmfao
I hope they didnt get any brain damage, especially Vik
more of this XD
Bro at least 1/3 of the video is just vikk getting bullied 😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
When it didn’t start off with “Helmet boy origins!”
It would be better without the helment
Damm it was so realy funny you need do this again :D
This is probably one of the most funny videos i have seen in a while, takes me back to the helium try not to laugh challenge type vids. love it 👍🏻

my cheekbones are hurting
ethans face at 5:28 is killing meeee
This is the most nonstop laughs i ever had HAHAHAHA
Video started with vik ends with vik poor vik!!
We need a part 2
I don't know if I'm the only oe that thinks it's much funnier when the sidemen talk more, I didn't enjoy this video that much :(
Vikks enviromental awereness Litteral TRASH
Vik just gets absolutely hammered 😂😂😂
Imagine All the Slapper agreeing to deny if their the one that slap the helmet and the helmet guy just get slapped for hours  🤣
Back to the good sidemen days when videos were simple yet very funny
Shoutout to Tobi for saving Vik there coz it was getting ropey 🤣
Fk off guys im in tears... laughing like mad 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yesssss, lessssss goooooo!!!! #VikAbuseIsBack.

10 minutes of non-stop laughter... this was amazing!!
Now JJs moved on to physical violence when will the the Vik abuse stop
Hella hilarious!
I like this 😂😂
it took 6 minutes for vik to do 1 hit
sidemen basically did a 9 minutes of _i like your cut g_ with a helmet
Vick got straight violated
Helmet prices will go up now.

Ethans face is the best
If you look at toby's head while he puts on the helmet (2:30) you can see the way his hair is kinda mission on the top of his head I think, or am I just tripping?
The legends say Tobi is still wearing the helmet until this day
Gold 😂😂
Vikk got bullied 😢😂
Vik wasn't hitting anyone because he didn't want to go back on the chair lol
Currently involved and actively engaging in assaulting the boys
Ksi was having the time of his life recording this video loll
This is goddamn hilarious😂😂
This is basically just the sidmen dying for 10 minutes straight
We used to play this game as kids at my school. No helmets were involved.
This is how you know Vik’s been a goody two shoe 🤣🤣🤣
The reason Vikk never became a doctor was due to this video
7:10 jj laugh 🤣🤣🤣i choked on my shallow and started coughing 😂😂😂😂
LMAOOO WE NEEED A PART 2🤣🤣🤣🤣

LMAO, I loved this video, short and funny, only thing that could’ve made it better is some sort of second camera angle that showed the person in the chairs face when they turned around to stare at the slappers.
This is peak moresidemen
This is the funniest video in a while
i thought you will never return to sidemen
That hat deserves a medal for squeezing onto Josh's head 🤣

I got 2 weeks of school work to do cuz i had to stay home cuz of covid. Im back to school in 2 days but watching sidemen is more important
Ethan got caught because he looked guilty, then the next time he slapped he made the exact pose and face and didn't get picked. He was lucky the others didn't pay attention.

This was something else 😂😂😂
Can't believe we didn't get one helmet boy origins reference from Vik
Free brain damage
tbh probably the funniest More Sidemen video since the Moo Off we need more old sidemen videos like these, absolute class

One of the funniest video ideas😂

This should be a drinking game. Every time the slapper gets caught, he takes a shot. Every time the guy with the helmet on gets the first slap right, everybody else takes a shot.
Ethan going for the KO
Sidemen smacking each other is the funniest thing ever
It's like 2015 yt again! 9 minute videos full of content  The golden days

dam vik, he's only slapped 2 times and one of those two times he got picked
7:33 JJ plays it so smart there slapping him while laughing so he doesn't guess him
Alternative title: Sidemen slap each other on the head and laugh.
yoooo why is vik getting bullied 🤣🤣🤣
اللهم أنت ربي لا إله إلا أنت خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت أعوذ بك من شر ما صنعت ابوء لك بنعمتك علي وأبوء بذنبي فأغفر لي فإنه لا يغفر الذنوب إلا أنت

They should do one the these while drunk 😂🤣
what harry did is not at all nice or funny
One of the best MoreSidemen video EVER 🤣🤣🤣  Need more of these unusual games 😭
Title should've been "try not to wheeze" or "Wheezin video"
😂😂😂😂
Omg I was dying!! 🤣🤣
#StopVikAbuse
that was the hardest i laughed at a sidemen video in a while🤣🤣
I think we should revive #stopvikkabuse after the madness he suffered here.
This made my neck hurt 🤣
Just some mates being mates

i havent laughed this hard in so long
Vik got violated
I laughed my fucking ass off for a video of sidemen slapping each other 😂😂😂😂 classic
I could watch a whole hour of them doing this

I remember seeing this in YT shorts very funny
For a good minute I thought this whole video was gonna be the rest of them slapping vik

This should’ve been one of the games in Silent Library😂😂
Road to jj getting shoulder length dreads
Same energy as The Pointing Game one. So simple yet really hilarious
Vik defo got CTE after that first round 😂😂
this needs to be redone as a main channel video
I saw this the other day on insta and glad you guys did this 😂
Best MoreSidemen video ever!! Had me laughing for 10 whole minutes
Sidemen are really bullying vikstar
MORE MORE MORE 😂😂😂😂
My friends and I used to play a similar game!  We stood in two rows opposite of eachother about an arm length apart and one person had to walk between the two rows and got whacked on the head at random times until they could tell who whacked them. Was lots of fun especially seeing the anxiousness in their eyes when they had to walk between the row where anyone could whack them lol.
Maybe next time try without helmet, and use sledge hammer.
Why is this the funniest but the most simplistic concept for a fucking video, gold🤣🤣🤣
This is like the OG sidemen vids. More please!!!
<3
Vik abuse is back
Vik has CTE now LMFAOOOOOOOO legit the funniest video I’ve seen in a while
my stomach hurts from laughing 🤣🤣
this is my favourite sidemen vid after along time
This should be a forfeit in forfeit videos.
7:07 Josh 😂😂
Main channel worthy hahahaha
How am I giggling at this simple game like its peak comedy 😂😂
Honestly love how it goes from nice light tape to let’s see who can break the helmet 😂😂😂😂
The long awaited return of Helmet boy❤️
0:40 LMAOOOO ITS THE WAY HE TURNS 💀😭
5:49 DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR SIMON SAY MA N**** OR IS IT JUST ME?
Vikk is gonna wake up with fewer brain cells than Ethan..
In the balkans we played this with no helmet. People getting dizzy from the hits puts it to a new level 😂
This was one of the funniest videos ever uploaded on this channel. So simple yet so effective.
the best piece of comedy ive ever watched
they need to do it with go pros on so we can see what they look like when they turn around and look up 😂
Poor Vik
The FA.... 'dont head footballs'  The Sidemen... ' SIDEMEN HELMET GAME'
this had me dyingggggg
This was easily a Sidemen Sunday video,  so simple yet so funny 10/10 😂
35 MINUTES AGO? I LITERALLY SAW A SHORTS ABOUT THIS GAME AND I WAS INTERESTED, SO I SEARCHED IT ON YT! AND MY FAV CHANNEL MADE A GAME ABOUT IT???? WHAT A COINCIDENCE!
JJ laughed the whole time 🤣
This was the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while😂😂

The Sidemen is the best group on YouTube because their friendship is so natural and relatable
They must’ve seen the YouTube short 😂
Me in the washroom just hysterically laughing at 7 men hitting each other 😂😂😂
We want more of this
3:12...ultra instinct activate
9 and half minutes made my day Who agree?
They should keep this as a forfeit for one of the sidemen videos  And also a part 2 is required
7:07 have seen this like 10 times but it still is funny... Idk if it's JJ laughing or me 🤣😂
This is a full video of jj laughing 😂 Got to love it
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dude this is  fun, seeing them laugh like this  made the day
bruv these ppl are just fkn hitting eachother with helmets and earning hundreds and thousands of dollars. Makes me look stupid :(
Fuck me that had me in stitches
that's jokes, was worth being up at 3am
🤣🤣OMG My face hurts. poor Vik
This is such a good video
Simplest idea yet one of the funniest ideas. Need more of these please
The content has hit its peak its down hill from here
JJ taking heads off
Yeah I agree with the person below me this is way to funny for only one video plz do more
Basically we just say men snap each others head for 9 minutes 😂😂😂
One of the best of all time
vic is getting bullied man
Every part of my head hurts Even watching this, and my jaws too 🤣
This is about to be hilarious
This video will be a masterpiece for many years........
This was such jokes, man. The Sidemen can really make anything funny 😂
Do a part 2 it’s too funny
I laughed 10min non stop😂😂😂
This video was jokes
#stopvikabuse
I liked this video a lot. I think you should do it again.
Pt. 2?
This right here is one of the simplest yet funniest style of video. This would be amazing with troops or random Guests.
Please more of these I'm crying this so funny😂😂😂
When someone leaves a spare helmet lying around
unreal
Brah when we play this game we don't use the helmet
new title: Vikk getting bulied for 5 minutes
Started the video with Vik and ended it with Vik 😂😂😂
it’s the slow turn from vik and the finger point that gets me everytime. especially when he was one off the person 😭
Such a funnny video just constant laughter
This content was so simple, but so enjoyable
1st time ive ever seen this challenge
Classic
The trick of this game is to hit hard enough so that they get a concussion and start guessing themselves
idk how they came up with this but this is the best thing I've ever seen them do
Imagine they had all planned against vik and didn't tell him when he had guessed right and just knock him the whole video
I can’t remember the last time I laughed continuously through an entire video. This was so funny!
Might be better than the Moo Off LMAO
this peaks along with among us and gta fr
Straight just guy things 😂😂😂
i couldn't stop laughing that was sooo funny💀
Absolutely class
Laughter really is contagious! This was sick 😂
the video should be named 'KSI laughing hard"
3:47 is it gonna fit jj's head
more of this bcs it so fucking funny..i pissed myself a little bit
This was one of the funniest videos i watched in a while. Please give us MOREEEEEE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Son Harry kicked him 🤣🤣🤣
this was amazing
The first one with Vik was the funniest 😂 man turned the opposite way everytime
8:49 what was that simon?
This possibly my favourite video of the year already

This is like old sidemen content and I love it
#stopvikabuse
Fucking great 😂
i think jj was high asf hahahah
Vikstar becomes helmet boy once again
Poor Vik, but get them views!
Vik is helmet boy. He doesn’t feel anything when he’s got his helmet on that’s why it was so difficult for him to guess
If im not wrong, we have this game in indo as well... and sidemen made this simple game into a masterpiece. Well done😀
jjs looking clean with the hair
yessss you did!, i was waiting for this
#StopBullyingVik
Vik got bullied again in first 2 minutes
Watching 7 grown men slap each other around
Vik gets bullied
This is pretty much the albanian game called "bzzzz" (literally the sound 🐝) with safety precautions. (Cause in our version you have no helmet and you get smacked)
Helmet boy origins mate🤣🤣
We need more. Do one with the beta squad in it or something it's just way too funny.
Nice
If someone asked me to sum up the sidemen I’d show them this video

some1 should break the chair legs while others punch one in the helmet
Simple and effective
VIK was violated for three minutes 😂😂😂 this was so funny 🤣
The focus of the sidemen seems to drift more to side+ and away from YouTube
The only time vik hit he got got😂
VIKS GOING TO KNOW ITS TOBI CAUSE TOBI NOT GOING TO HIT HIM HARD.
Low key thought the entire video was gonna be vik
if everyone is laughing its deadly because you dont know who caused it

Fun fact In india this game is known as ( Tapli baazi ) we used play this game when we were like 7 😅
I legit laughed throughout the whole video 😂

7:31 JJ just looks like a 2 year old who realised that hitting someone was funny I cried my eyes out
The chain looks so sick and i’d literally wear it all the time if i had it but i can’t have side+ :/

The sidemen has decided to retire early due to everyone having severe concussion after filming this video

Harry saying “you” is the funniest thing ever.
bruh this was short but made me laugh so hard the entire vid😂😂😂
Did they record silent library 2? This set looks like it could be similar to that one.
Tobi was dead from beginning to end
Starts with Vik being abused and ends with Vik being abused.
This video 70% JJ laughin + otjhers 10% zerka slams 20% vik getting rekt
this was one of the best
This is probably one of the shortest videos they’ve uploaded in 2 years or so, and ended up being one of the funniest videos I’ve watched.
having such a shit day and this has made it 100x better thankyou
Now that was funny asf lmao 🤣
Please make part 2 of it.... Though concept is old but sidemen doing it have taken it to next level 🤣🤣🤣🤣

*Josh hit Vikk for 6 runs.* 🤣
Vik has to respawn after taking this much damage

Could not breathe for 9 minutes straight coz of laughter..
I don’t know why vik didn’t choose obvious ppl that hit him😂
Now that's funny
This game is so stupid and yet I couldn’t stop laughing 🤣
literally laughed the whole video
They smacked the shit out of that helmet.

Cool 😎
'Hey lads, I got an idea for a video, it'll be great' 'Sure, what is it?' 'We take it in turns slapping someone, maybe say half a sentence every 2 mins, and giggle like school girls constantly' 'BANGER'
This is so much funnier than it should be 😂😂

Just seen a tiktok on this looks like a laugh if shots were involved if you got caught

Dont know why but I teered up from laughing ,omg that was funny
Nah they violated vik 😭😭😭
Non stop laughs and smiles. Props to the person who thought of the video idea
Lol
I love how they start by slapping to full on critical hits.
Getting whiplash in the chair 😂😂

7:09 i'm dying the way simon head🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They are doing it wrong ! The helmet guy can look behind any time they want, to catch the hitter. It's not a guessing game. Take the risk to hit but if you get caught your gonna get hit !!
That was so good
8:40 how does vikk not notice JJ shaking his hand in pain?? 🤣🤣🤣
This video is basically vik getting battered
Would be better if it was a bucket 🪣
When Harry kicked vik in the head 💀💀😭
If Timo Werner watched this he would say “what is dis”
its so much funnier when its helmet boy
Felt like a bachelor party for Vikk
Laughing the whole time its stupid but fun
#stopvikkabuse
This was the dumbest yet funniest video ever
If Josh wearing that helmet doesn't becomea meme...
