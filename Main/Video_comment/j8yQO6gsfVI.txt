You only need 1 thing: a kid. That kid will be (idk if you want one) sooo good as a human next to 2 dogs, and you'll be prepared as a mother with tucker and todd :)
❤❤❤❤
Nothing like a mommy hug !!
Hekk you dad 😂😂😂😂
0:03
She said “nothing like a daddy “💀💀💀
Hahaha our dog does the same whenever our family do a group hug 😂😂😂
Jealousy is not the cause. hugs are not a part of a dog's life, and they get used to it daily. So, to them, it might look like an attack, and so they having an eye on it. This is also why some dogs do not react when an intruder attacks, because to them, it may look like a hug. However, there are smart dogs...

Pet dog mistakenly thinks she may dump pet dog and accept Mr. NewMan.
"I'm the fluffy one here, hug me too!"
The dog said: go away, this is my girlfriend
Hahahahah hahahahaha 🤣

One chance please
My dog is a whole lot worse we can’t get within 2 feet of each other without jumping in between us
Oh
He is Golden
A love triangle, one woman and two guys , she can handle it,  she is a gringa, they can do that and more.
The answer why I like cats. Not fking barks.
My pet turtle doesn’t do that 😢
Tucker is awesome
Adorable 🥰 I truly love canines. To human is to canine and vise versa
Yes they want only love
My pitball used to do that
I swear I'm selling that dog the following morning. It has overstayed its welcome 🤔
Such a cute dog! Especially the way it sits🥰😍
I LOVE TUCKER SOOO MUCH HE SO CUTE
It's funnier without the dog-speak
Please support my kittens ❤️😿
😂😂😂😂😂😂
He just thought you said you were going shopping at Target and Christmas in June and wanted to go too. No wait, that’s your wife that does that.
But what does “Happiness is Hamamader” mean?
Oooh after this vidéo I really wanna get one sooo cute
Why whenever an animal on YouTube has attained the remarkable ability to speak, the animal is not able to lean proper grammar?
How cute! Such a big fur baby.
No one is talking about how she needs to be on her toes for a hug👀
Прелестная хозяйка у этого лабрадора! )
Ok.. he must be a boyfriend... New...
poor Dog😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤗💋💋💋💋💋🤗😇😇😇😇😇
Non capisco il farfallino, a chi lo dovete regalare?
Ya; sure, dogs don't like to be hugged. And I understand thus. But as soon as we hug our partner... Dog wants in!??
Am I Invisible!🐶
That's one thirsty A "female dog" right there. Jeez dog, have some self respect.
If she looked like that, I'd be the exact same way.  Dayum.... this was awesome,  though.
That's a big dog tho
Not again
Excuse me
Not again...
Excuse me...
I have a border collie mix who is so happy all of the time but her barking is out of control.  When I hug my husband she barks and she follows him everywhere she is completely obsessed I’m lost I don’t know what to do please help me lol

My maltipoo does same thing
Our dog walked between our legs when we were doing a whole lot more than hugging😉
He or she  wants a hug too is jealous
Dogs don’t like it when we hug.  They don’t understand and interpret it as us fighting.  They try to break it up
My dog growls, barks, and shows her teeth at my wife.
That's a boi!!!
❤❤😂😂

My dog would be so confused like, " GIVE ME HUGS TOO NOT JUST YOUR GIRLFRIEND "
Hey, it's my turn, me too
👍🏻👌🏻
haha..your dog is jealous.  Better train the dog to accept the situation for the benefit of your future baby.😃  Or you have to hug the dog whenever you hug anyone...🥰🥰🥰
I feel so bad for the dog-😭
😂😂😂
That filthy mutt is thinking “yum two big meals waiting for me. Let’s see which one’s nose I can chew first”

Tucker, " Hey, I am the leading actor here. Back off Dude."
This has been our experience for fourteen years.  Our little Yoshi still is jealous for hugs.

Suppose dog Sees them during sex😁
It's amazing some of the hot women that some guys have you can tell he really is not into hugging his girl but you girls keep going for those same kind of guys
My pit would do the same whether it’s my family, lady, friends. That girl was jealous😅. I miss that dog though….
Awe 🫢 omg 😱 so ❤️🇨🇦
Reminds me of my family’s golden. He was with us until he was 12 years old. I basically grew up with him (I was 4 when we got him) and when I was younger and would cry, he would always try and hug me to make me feel better. I miss him so much <3
really too cute. 🤗
This is why cats are better than dogs.
Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The jealousy level 🥰 💕💋

You’re mean Linda😂

Doggone days: "Give me some Loves!"
We have a red golden, and I confirm, they really are like that lol 😂
I have the same issues with my twin daughters and 2 dogs. My dogs don't want me to hug no one but them. My daughters don't want me to hugging my husband. Daddy's Girls
Poor doggy wanted his hugs as well.
Ignore the dog. Focus in the mission. Keep your eyes on the prize.
What a sweet and beautiful boy!
This is so sweet 😩 Who watched it more than twice
Wrong Grammatical but still half million like that’s amazing!!
Who's that?  Tucker: huh?
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
So cute
It’s a territory/hierarchy instinct in dogs, and it’s cruel that you torture that dog mentally for the sake of a few likes. You shouldn’t be allowed to keep animals.
You guys are so rude to do that to the dog 🐕
God entered into my body, like a body. my same size. this is holy ghost baptism. next. God started attacking me, ripping my face, shooting in mouth disease, Jesus appears, laughs, teases
Our dog starts to nip at my fingers when we hug. Jealous little snot.
What's that? tucker: hekk you
Beautiful breed.. I'm jealous. 👍
I have 2 year old springer spaniel and he does the same thing
Anche il cane 🐕 vuole le carezze.
My golden doodle does that too! And he wakes every person in the morning with a lick on their mouth…yuk 😆
What the heck ? Can I has ? Lol.this made me hilarious tho! Chikk pikk
“Hecc you dad” 😂😂

Cute! So adorable 🥰
My dog starts barking really loud if we hug. Now I know why😂
That's one fine looking dog 🐕 😍
He's so adorable and involved you can tell hes used to be in love  to pieces
Normal, si vous l'avez éduqué de la sorte ; car vous couchez même avec vos chiens !!
My dog was abused before we got him. He gets real upset and barks when anyone has Physical contact of any kind. It saddens my heart every time.
So cute
The sigma male says: YOU DUMBASS NIGGA!!! *this is not me*

Very Cute!
👍👍👏👏👏👏👏🥰
Tucker is jealous ☺️
You hug that baby right now !!!
He is trying to break up what he believes is the prelude to a fight. This is typical dog behavior (by instinct, not experience).
Don't give touched for ur entertainment and video
He’s saying “Mom Jeans”
only a dog would be attracted to these partners
Ur dog is so cute! 🥺🥺
I HATE 🐕 DOGS
H H H H .... 😘😘😘🌹

Quên em à không ôm em à chị đáng ghét quá 🤣
I'am very strong black man I love to hug too and kick the dog butt
How do you know he doesn't sound more like, "Pardon me, madam, sir, but I would greatly appreciate a bit of affection myself!"?
It's called a threescore!
Aye what breed is this? And does it shed a lot? Thanks in advance for the reply.
I got a mix, gsd/retriever. He starts barking and jumping on us
When I was growing up, my mother had this chihuahua. He was skinny, ugly, and mean. He would ATTACK me and my brother if we showed our mother any affection, or if she showed us any affection. Lucky for us, he was way too small to do any actual damage, but never have I met so much evil in such a small body.
priceless! thanks!
But i don't have dog😂
Just hug the dog woman and stop being so silly!
I was like you Better hug that baby right now!!!!😂
Cute
I think the dog is the only source of intelligent life in this video.
Heek you dad 😅😂🤣

My service dog (a golden also) is jealous as well.  He will jump on my wife's lap getting between us, and once we are separated, he will sit between us just looking at me.
My lab always does that
Animals are better than we humans...
"He likes his mom but dislikes his dad"
He just wants a hug
I want some honey too lol
Very nice movie you have to release 2 3 4 5 parts

Our golden always wanted to have a hug! I miss him so much.

Hey dogs get jealous as well
My dog trys to join the hug, I don't have a partner so it's my dad
Why do you call your husband “your partner?” Do you go on police patrols together or something?
Le chien est son mari😘
Estos son los videos que me encantan, incluyendo a sus mascotas
Mine does that too, but if we ignore her too long, we end up on the floor. As she is a Great Dane and easily pushes us over to get in on the action 🤣
Lol
Frickin love dogs!!!!!!!!!!
Not cool to tease children or pets.  They become confused & afraid their not accepted.  ~*~
I had a German Shepherd years ago and I had some female over 1 night.  Well that being said my female dog got between us and kicked the girl outta my bed.
Very cute, but pretty sure he thinks you are fighting and tries to deescalate
Cute 😍
😎❤️
My dogs the same way she loves to get in on the action.

Esta celoso
Golden Retrievers get jealous when they see there not getting any attention.

They should rename the Golden Retriever Attention Hound! I really like the ones that are darker than most.
The dad: *hello,its me*

Get your dog a partner, why are you hurting the poor thing? You want it to be jealous? You will taste it too.

YouTube loves promoting these fucking married woman videos to single guy’s YouTube feeds
My dog does the same thing😂
They should do it again but let Mom stay completely quiet and let Dad address him the same way she did in this video.  Let’s see the dog’s reaction.
He Is A Jelly(Jealous) Bean
Cute dog.
Omg Tucker 😂 😂🤣🥰😍
Disgusting
Now try doggi style in from of you dog and see his reaction
Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
Hekk u dad I’m dying 🤣😂
Golden's are so damn lovable, loyal and intelligent. They are great for kids, their only down side is that on the average they only live about 10 years maybe 12, on the average. They literally steal your heart and become a intrical part of your family and it is so damn painful when they go.
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Olá eu Edilene! Tenho uma fêmea é idêntica, são lindos. Amo.!!
My wife's and I lab/shepherd mix does the exact same thing! 😄
Our dogs in Ghana do not behave like this … maybe because their main focus is getting food.
I do that and my dog barks
This is why bringing a new baby at home can cause problems with a dog. Especially a violent dog like pitbulls etc.. News 📰 flash dogs 🐕 get jealous 🧐.
Tucker is tall-
Um..I’d like a hug to! 😄
😂🤣
Yep 🙏🇺🇸
Nerd
He’s such a jealous boy 🐕 😂😂😂
If a chick were to hug me, my dog would have to be put down.  Seriously.  Extremely protective.
lovely dog😁
Sooooooooooooo nice.  Sooooooooooooo funny.  Lovely.  That s making me desire to want to be with you and hug the all of you too. Cheers. Peace. 😇😇❤❤❤❤❤❤

We pretend to be fighting, talking loud to each other and our pinscher gets in the middle, pushing us to the sides with his little paws... animals are incredible ❤
DEPENDS ######### but not this types #######

Dogs 🐕 are very smart, they have same  types human feelings, or in their pass lives are human spirits them selfs, something to think about 🤔
🤣😂🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣😁🤣
Apparently, animals have more conscience and intelligence than they get credit for

😂🤗
🥰🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟❤️👍
I love Tuckers bow tie.
Fofura
So cute 😊
I have a dog name Leo he is a chow chow breed and he does the same ❤️
Stupidity of ppl by doing this. Never date a person who has pets or if you get attached to a pet your partner would be targeted by your pet. Dogs are to be out side .
Aww so cute ! We just got a yellow Labrador retriever and he’s completely obsessed with me 💛 I finally fell in love with another dog after the loss of my baby 4 years ago. He’s the sweetest pup 🐕
How about me I just want a hug
I bet that dog is getting more than hugs from her when they’re alone!!!
🤣🤣😂
He also needs hugging friend
Our 2 golden retrievers do exactly the same thing to my wife and I.
😘💋👍
Better close the door when you decide to make love!
Poor Lil Tucker he just wanted a hug 🫂. 😆 🤣 😂  lo
He loves her the dog I mean maybe the guy to.
I wish my dogs were like Tucker ❤
"hekk I dad😂😂😂😂
I kinda want a hug too?
Hug, pet and kiss the top of your dog's head or cheek and see what your partner does.
He's jealous poor boy
Na wetin Dey happen for Nigeria b this, girl n dog sleeping with each other for 1.5 m
Yes he wants a hug too...

Nothing jealous there
My male  dog starts barking when I hug my husband my female dog can care less
Hey I’m a big fan
Aww🤗
Awe tuckers left out 😂
fake
Ciumento
Um
Thats so cute
My dog comes running and barks
THE GREATEST INDIA...
Extremely love you all...
Actually, its not about hugs. In dogs world having head to head contact means fighting, so when u enter your home and hug you partner your dog thinks of it as a threat and gets in between to stop u from hurting each other. He is doing it to protect both of u because he's anxious. My dog does it too, he is a gsd.
Are golden retrievers like the nicest dogs ever?
I hate red hats...!!!.
I know here, who sleeps in the dog house.
I love how he says “ I’m huggable too”
Look like your dog had the experience and feeling jealous.
It’s funny how Linda had to go on tipi toes to stanf
Le 🤣INDIAN hug means.🤣🤣🤣🤣
good😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I have a Queensland heeler and she jumps up and nipps my legs or my arms until we stop , she is very jealous and thinks that I belong to her . We thought it was cute at first but not anymore !
OH MY GOD. My German Shepherd did the same thing when my dad and I did this. I thought we were the only ones
Dogs are extremely jealous animal.
My parents and I had a Poodle-Bichon (maybe Terrier) mix, and he did something similar. When we hugged, he would bark, jump up and start scratching at our butts. So we'd pick him up and include him in the hug, which he liked even less lol
Friggin stupid music is annoying AF..
Am huggable got me 💕
🤔😁😁😁🥰
Poor Tucker not feeling loved. 😢
🤣
V =v vvvv vvv
Vvvvv=v.
Cvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv&fvvvvv f v= +
My dog also dose that, every time I hug my girl friend, he don’t like it,
Gy
Awe how sweet
Everyone gangster until they realise that the dog has a hard on.
Funny dog 😂
i wanna hug you too linda
Sad
Well....Even I'd hug Linda for that long than the dog
❤
I want to see what is the reaction of your dog when you s,x with your husband
I had a golden retriever but mine died
Hes so cute🥺🥺🥺
My dog just barks at me when I hug my mom because she hates seeing people and gets jealous when people are hugging my mom, only she can hug my mom hahahahaah 😂
Dog learn to say "please" instead of "PWEEZ"..😂😂 good try though.
Funny my dog does the same thing
dog is also her husband..
He’s like “Hoomans Pweeze hug me too I deserve many many hugs from you hoomans”
I love Tucker 😍😍😍💜💜💜💜
He was feeling left out
Great looking husky
The worst thing for a Golden is to not be included. Lol.
It’s cute watching but I will say it … I know I am not the only one who sees that as just too much over the top and would be annoying to deal with on a revaluation basis . It’s like cmon  ow . Can’t even enjoy partner 10 seconds after possibly entertaining the doggie 2 hrs straight . No thanks
😍😍😍
I can't get over the 80s mom jeans. Fashion is ridiculous. Round and round we go. We used to use safety pins to pin our jean cuffs so they would be super tight to our ankles. I'm not doing it again. I get as much of a kick out of these kids as my father used to get out of us. Haha.   - Guy in his 40s 🤷‍♂️😝
Dogs don't like hugs and they don't understand them. He was probably concerned that someone's being hurt.
This girl looks like Eva Lovia!!!
Looks like your dog is comfortable between yo legs
Where did you get Tucker?
Il est mignon ❤
Mine starts immediately humping my husband’s leg, even though the doggy is fixed!
He's jealous! 🤣
If you both sandwich him in the middle, I think he’d be in heaven!💕😇
That dog is like me and those couples like are like my mom dad😂😂😂😂😑😑😌😐
You are a dog hugger and you like dogging around
Your dog doesn’t want to hug you… Your dog wants bang you not hug you
I'd like to hug you both, I can be in the middle, possible 3some! Spice it up your marriage with an open swingers... You'll both be even more happier.
ME LA SUDA
Take off that bow tie FFS
My dog does the same thing..nobody is allowed to get attention from my wife unless he gets it too. Lol
xddd
Every time my wife and I cuddle on the bed to watch TV... our cat and dog wants to join us and stay right in between of us 😆 😆
He's just saying the dog is annoying af lmao
Mom jeeeaaans!😂
Most jealous dog ever
I'd rather f*** the dog get rid of her
Gotta love that lady love!! 😄
My dog will bite 😂
While that was kind of mean to your dog you should have hugged her to or a boy dog
😀
He's just a little horn dog.. he wasn't even interested in the male
Many of the legends might have said that only dog understand the feelings of human.
so süß
I think ppl are weird who do the whole " I'm gonna speak for the doggo in quotes"...
Cute
My cat does that lol
The dogs telling you that there’s been at least 2 other dogs between her legs… just sayin
Yall look like the sims hugging😂
Tucker is not jealous.....
Just think if humans could create entitled children and then show them off on social platforms for clicks and a check in the mail from Google!
comentando em qualquer video aleatório
It's funny how dogs get jealous of their owners hugging. My Aunt's Dog always jumped in between us when we hugged
🐕💕
Can we please see how the dog acts when I hug her?
try boning a new chick with a jealous,spoiled pitbull...he started blowing turds all over the room...the dog won...
My dog just jumps at me LOL
How can you not hug that doggie!
i lost my dog :(
Dog: I want to hug 😊
Let's be honest, she's way out of his league
Heck u Dad😄😂😂
Dassa hairy boi
"HEK YOU DAD" GOT ME HARD 😅😂😂😂
Is this golden retriever.....?😉
❤️❤️❤️
I like his bow tie.
Mama can't resist him 💘♥️💘
Should be how the d reacts
It's because Dogs don't have an understanding or equivalent to a "Hug", so they panic or react oddly.
Love grows love!
I have a jealous one too
if you want something, you have to ask
So sweet
What happen when you and your hubby wanna get busy? 😂😂😂
Lucky fuckin dude there.
😑I love it
My dog loves walking between my legs for hugs! It's the best
AWW
Mmmm aaaa mmm aaa is think he’s not hugging he’s dry humping
How cute 🥰
Sweet
Hahahahaha
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins 💓💓
Marriage test… does your wife only hug you when making social media posts about her dog?  FAIL!!!!!
The dog loves attention
it's funny those 2 humans only have fur on their head. the rest of their body is bald 🤣
0:40  *at that exact moment your dog would likely bark*
Fucking annoying ass dogs lol
my brother has a little dog that also gets very jealous when people hug
Take the damn dog hunting and remove the goofy bow.
Dogs are so good
God I hate this dubbed women's voice. You hear it all over Instagram and it's soooo annoying!!!
LINDA GO HUG TUCKER
Outstanding! We had are Goldie and she went to Heaven. Your video is the best I've seen. Thank you!❤️
I did this with my dad and my dog went crazy!
Mine does the same haha
I wonder how many people have seen or met random golden retrievers they didn't know that came up wanting pets or hugs.  I've literally lost count personally, but it is a lot that I've met and seen.
Him boops dad and says hekk you dad at last 🤣
Ask Tucker do you like mommy or daddy better
She’s out of his league
He did that bc he loves you so much  His love for you is undefined ❤️
Can someone please explain to me why beautiful young women have brought back mom jeans?
You can just tell how privileged this girl is. Probably votes republican too. 🤮
He's telling you it's time to give him a little baby to play with.
Is it me or does she have tons of makeup
I find it really interesting that people find out something that was known for years, they record it and post it to gain 11mio views.
Same as mine😂😂🤣
Dogs are magnets to affection. Jealousy overrides their impulses.
tucker on the verge of a mental flip off
I wish she’d hug and kiss me. She’s so pretty
🙄
I’m so glad my dogs aren’t the only ones who do this 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
No one cares
That's awesome That's why I love dogs.
Can't you talk for yourself? Stop fcking using that bot.
He's like hey he's mine get your own man!!!!!
My dog does that all the time 😂
Damn I hate how high pants are nowadays lol
lol your husband is a grown up man with a baseball cap :D
Wish my dog did that
What's that dig breed some one comment please
"hekk you dad" LMAO That's what I said when my dad went to get milk.....
That's a beautiful dog.
Omg 😱 I literally just tried this and my little Maltese came running up and starting scratching my leg and not giving up until I hugged him. These poor baby are just the darnest thing. 🐶
I pitty the husband.
Awe this is so cute, I love that little bow ❤️
Homie just wants the bow tie off🤣😉
My  dog waits patiently outside the drugstore for me to finish shopping,  if I go in with one of my kids then he will not stop barking in rage.
Dang, if I bark will she give me a hug? No hug from the husband though, I'll just shake his hand. Lovely couple, gorgeous dog.
I laughed so hard because when Tucker was hugging Linda he said hekk dad😂😂😂
Do you guys think she let the dog do her doggy style?
Tuker has the best Mommy and Daddy!
It’s husband or wife no partner
What’s a partner?
My doodle does the EXACT same thing, except he’s a little more aggressive with it 😂😅
The best actor goes to this dog 🐶
i think she loves her dog more than her husband lmao idk
☺️💪🥰👏☺️
I'm not a animal person but I love this.
Lol my dog will start barking at me❤️
Definitely Linda's dog
😂😂😂😂😂😂♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I guess this is the real meaning of a Jealous Bitch
That bowtie looks so good on him
I love your videos
“Tucker is too pure he won’t steal your girl”  Tucker: hecc u dad Linda loves me

Tucker: Linda huge🤗 hekk you dad🙄  P.s. was it just me or was it so funny to me that Linda had to stand on her tippy toes the entire time.
In my house whenever someone hugs near the dog then he will come running and jump up onto the people He's a German shepherd and his name is Gibs

Tucker is more Hondsam than your partner
He loves you more than him Tucker #1

Wait, does that mean you never hug?
I got jealous as well
My dog does the same
that's so sweet and gentle...my dog growls when he gets jealous
Tucker be like:AM M9RE HANDSOME THAN HIM
When ever I hug someone, one of my family members dog barks and jumps at us for some reason I think it might be that he’s too protective and that he thinks someone might hurt someone which is strange lol. Your videos are adorable!
My dog was a kind of like that when I talked to my mother.
I have also golden ritiver pupoy he is also like this
Ohhh he's jealous with his dad 😂
Our family dog would do the same sort of thing when my dad hugged my mom. It was quite funny
I hugged my other Rottweiler puppy and then my other one wanted a hug and every time I hugged the other one the other one wanted a hug!
Omg this is so relatable my dog does this too
If me and my family pretend hit each other my dog goes crazy bc he thinks we're hurting each other. It's so cute!! :)))
It’s because dogs can feel jealous and my dog does this
Wow you really have an intelligent dog 😁
Your pup is wonderfully sweet.
Omg, the freaking bowtie! SO CUTE!!!! 😍

When I hug my wife are dog does the same

When Linda said, "What's that?" ...Tucker also looked here and there not realizing she was referring to him.😝😅
He put his bow tie on and everything and still was rejected 🥲🥲🥲
Husband : it's the right moment  Tucker : nice try mate B)
I watch this, and it blows my mind that there are still "cat people" in this world.
CAN I HAS. 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨 EXCUSE ME!!!!!

Fgtt
I love how Tucker says Linda's husband as 'Dad' and Linda as 'Linda'!!
Dis is un outwage

I LOVE THIS CHANNEL SOO MUCH🐶🐾
Dog thinks they are arguing. This is not being jeolous.
Cuando mis papás se abrazaban, mi perro iba hacia ellos y empezaba a ladrar, jajaja
🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤
U r damn lucky...
This is the actual proof that you don't need kids to have a family.
My dog barks and gets between my wife and I. She is very jealous of me. She thinks she is my woman.
“We doin hugs?” Lmaoo😭
Shut up you mouth and I'll take it lol
Is her name actually Linda
Poor dog, he is breaking my heart. 🤣🤣🤣
sooooooooooooooo cute ❤️❤️❤️
AWWWW I AM SO VERY GLAD THAT THE OWNERS OF THE DOG GAVE HIM A HUG TOO AFTER HE WAS JEALOUS AND THE BLUE BOW TIE COLLER WAS VERY CUTE.
"it's not a mistake, " ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
We have some jealous dogs, too. The look in their eyes says it all.
🥰😂💕❤️😍😘
Lol yep, my retriever did that too xD
Nice hiney
Mashallah, que Dieu vous accorde un animal vraiment affectueux, un certain nombre de serviteurs

Bold of you to assume that i have a partner
Dogs need some love too.
ANJING .. ADALAH HEWAN YANG : PALING MENGERTI PALING LOYAL PALING BISA DIAJAK BERTEMAN PALING RESEKK  DAN LUCU MANGKANYA JANGAN MENYAKITI DAN MEMBUNUH ANJING A. M. A. Z. I. N. G THE BEST
Lol when the dog says my turn.
Animals make the funniest comedian's and they don't have to say a word
It is sooo crazy how people in this country are obsessed with dogs and treat them almost like humans, Dogs weren't made for this, they are just animals like the rest of animals.
Dogs are your children too. They get jealous and need attention. They are usually a bit more obvious about it than the human kids. Nice family you have.
Love that
This is all I ask. Abundance of love and affection
Dog is more interested in the lady.
Wonder why Tucket says Linda hugs but hekk u dad? 🤣
My dog hates it when we hug
Rubbish
Yes

My dog starts getting excited and brings over his toy whenever someone else is hugging or goofing around.

He is so jealous
Omg those lovable Dogggggs
He's so jealous!!!
She gets jealous ❤❤❤💚💚
So so funny. How adorable 🤶👍🙏
Can tell the guys getting to like this hug a little too much. If you look closely at his groin you can see his **** poking out lol. Only kidding!!
Is this a dog video? The only thing I see are the pants that the girl is wearing with the high waistband. Its amazing to see because the girls in my highschool back in the late 1970's wore pants just like those.
Asqq
Awwww for adorable. ❤
😍😍😍😂😂💋💕💕🤗🐕
Oh the emo golden retrievers so lovely.
My little chihuahua  do the same 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So smart dog
My dog does this too. When my Maa hugs me, he wants it too... 😂😂✨
He’s so FLUFFYYYYYYyyyyyyyyy
So sweet 😆💙
He wants you to take that bow off him.
had to laugh about the  „excuse me!“  😆
Absolutely beautiful, Tucker is sooo JELLY’🤣🤣
So loveable!!
Yup,  those peanut butter stories are allllll true, dog’s behaviour says it all
Too funny. My dog did the same then he would squeeze his 100 lbs in between us!🤣🤣 but then he got all the lovin'
That dog is just like my niece after my nephew was born 🤣
Aw that's cute
Cute dog

🙄🙄🙄
Lol, this is my dog, she gets so jealous  when my boyfriend and I are affectionate. She even comes and sits between us if she feels like we are having to much conversation😂
Tucker is awesome
My dog would do the same thing😂😂😂
So cute
His fir is so shinnnny 💫
His fir is so shinnnny 💫
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This dog is not jealous. The dog is agitated, because he misinterprets human hugs as aggressive behaviour and wants to prevent his humans from escalating. Notice the dogs tailwag is not a happy wag and he wags more to the left, not the right, which is a typical sign for agitation.
😃😃😂
😂😂❤️❤️😁
fair warning. i make this mistake  every video. dont have a drink of anything when watching any videos. warning to computers and phone. it will get splattered :)
Awwww I feel so bad
原來想討抱抱,我還以為是爽得過山洞的機會而已😅 !
Cute dog's have feelings too.
Oh I absolutely love dogs
Adorable 🥰🥰
Golden Retrievers can be very dramatic..just ignore them for few seconds & you will never know what peace is..❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🙄😒
When my dad holds me or hugs me my dog goes insane
Yall gotta stop this dumbass dog language where you misspell every other damn word. It ain't cute, it's stupid
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
My family I do that we are family song and hug each other, and when my dog hears it, we’ve done it so often, he always comes in for the last part!
Hekk u daf
😂😂😂😂
Hug that baby! 😊❤
♥️♥️♥️ॐ♥️♥️♥️
I love This dog
🤔 Bad, terrible idea to make an animal jealous especially when it is yours!
❤️❤️❤️🐕
😂 I had a dog who would stand in between two people talking and yap if he wanted to be involved in the conversation
So cute❤
So cute oh my gash...
Very nice
Your dog is too good for you goofs
Tucker: GIMME A HUG NOW Me: +dies laughing*
Awwwww this is so cute
cute
Schön den Hund belohnen, wenn er bellt 🤦‍♀️
*Tucker: eyyy eyyy she’s Mine too.*  All he wants her attention lol he didn’t even care about the guy 😂
Why does the dog have to talk uneducated😂
hekk u dad 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lovely 🐾❤
My dog gets jealous lol
He wants to be a part of the PACK ❤️
Awww how cute 🥰 🥰🥰
Fun fact dogs think it's a threat when arms are around you that's why it's trying to put itself in between yall
Tucker was moving again and again and then linda says who's that and tuckers reaction was soooo cute
Your dog just wants in on the hugging and cuddling to that's all
Very sweet, dog is definitely jealous and wants in. ❤️
This is my boy when anyone hugs in our home! My golden doodle actually becomes jealous and jumps on us!
Body was searching for space in between by any chance😂😂💖
Hahaha
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍
Они все ревнивцы.
AW HECK!! LUV THIS!!! 😊💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Old video
I love how he sits down like ‘am good boi, can I has?’
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣ho tucker💋😊
Group hug.
tucker dosent like dad
Skaya?
tucker: linda hugs are muh favwit
che amore :)
Tucker is awesome.  Patient and loving.
Dogs do this because it’s not natural behaviour for them to hug so they think when you hug it’s a threat it’s him telling you guys stop fighting
Every Dog I have ever owned always tried to get between me and my Husband when he hugged or kissed me. It’s surprising how jealous a Dog can get, even if that Dog has been a member of the family for years. Most times it’s the Male in the Human relationship that the dog try’s to stop from hugging or kissing it’s Human Mother.
When my parents hug and kiss he barks
That’s so dumb writing what the dog is baking about 🤦‍♂️
Tucker having a serious Oedipus complex :P
Hahahah I love ❤️ this soooo cute 🥰
Heck u dad😂😂😂🤣🤣
Hekk u dad 💜🤣🐶
That’s why I don’t like dogs
I just got a weird thought. If I decide to stay single and get a Dog, I just know some man will walk into my life...I just know it...
They deserve to be loved too
Her dog looks jealous😆
Play fighting is fun too - dog will start barking as if to say guys knock it off you are on the same team. Also, she won't stick up for anyone of us, guess she has no favorites.
That's just like our dog ! She is just 13lbs though.
Priceless !!!
Some of you dudes in the comment section really need to get out the house more, I'm actually concerned for you guys.
Hey pay attention to me ! 😅😅😅😳
Awww! 😍 This is so cute
Doggo's not dumb, he can clearly see thats just your brother.
Tucker is really jealous dogyyy but he is really cutyyyyy,by by fromManuela
I love how tucker loved Linda More!
Omg…how cute…you gotta love dogs!
This is every single dog I have had in my life when some has a long hug
hes wearing a bowtie... how the hell can you NOT hug that dog?
Am here for you cutie 🐕
Pov You don’t have a partner or your dog
Funny reaction 😂
😂🥺
My dog would not be impressed nor would he ask, he’d just push in between and look at me as if I’d betrayed him in the worst way
My dog does this too
I want some hug too🤗 haha awaw
Typing out what you think the dog is thinking is weird, typing it like a child is even more weird.
My dog was never insecure.
He's so beautiful
Their dog also jealous.....🤣
Aww lol
The way he just “ Hek you “ I felt it lol. I did this with my brother and my dog freaked he is a golden doodle. He jumped on my brother tried to push him. I am the dogs favorite
Jennifer Aniston got younger it seems.
Love the “hekk u Dad” 😂
Hekk u dad LOL
im like the dog
Lol so cute
My dog do exactly the same but its not for ur husband, he do it cos he wants attention to him from you.
Poor little guy, lmfao
When my sister hugs her boyfriend My dog Is jealous and will start Barking and jumping of how mad he is
Yo wad da dog doin?
That dog is just like me
Get a dog, fellas. A dog will find you a wife.
If I was tucker I would start hugging ur husband more
haaaaaaa
the song JEALOUS BONE  was obviously written with a doggy in mind LOL
Idc what these ppl say about you. You're not thhhat  bad.
Nice video! My dog does the same thing! :)
Lol ain’t no fun if your dog can’t have none lol 😂
WHEN U HAVE CRUSH FOR GIRL THAT IS WAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY... ABOVE UR LEAUGE
our 7 yr old male Golden Retriever same exact thing
The thumbnail made it look like the dog was extremely long with no back legs
Now hold up, that was way too much English dog translation 🤔 😂 Like they communicating lol
So funny🤣
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV,  Jesus Christ is the only way.........
btw I can never get used to *shoes in the house*
They look drunk
My pit want to eat my arm off when I hug my wife daughter or grandkids. He is huge!
I’ve seen so many videos of people training their animals to use audible buttons to communicate. It’d be so cool to watch Tucker (or the new puppy) learn that, because he has such a great personality & would probably use the buttons in unique ways x)
Is high as a lot of these women pull their pants up I don't know why they don't just wear overalls
Tucker is a mamas boi
My dog does that :  chill jelly  (when I ment jelly I really did not mean his name is jelly he is just jealous)
Video: TikTok voice Me: Fsck that sh^t, next!
You look like my teacher miss einon
I can't believe nine thousand people clicked the thumbs down on this video ??????  What is wrong with people?  I bet these are the same people that run over squirrels!
Good boy. 😊
OMG LINDA HUGS... hekk u dad 😂
Nobody likes being the third wheel, even a dog
He is just secretly looking at that booty lol
Who else want a hug?
aww!! he is very cute dog i also want a dog like you tucker
That hekk you dad in the end tho
Soooo cute
Hekk u dad 🤣🤣🤣
I don't have a doogggggggggg
So cute
That’s so 🥰
Omg!! My dog ges nuts he I do that. So f..ng adorable!! Beautiful pupp...
HAHAHA “hekk u dad”
Classic shorts formula, " make sure girlfriends ass is center frame for maximum clicks". Way to sell your gfs body for internet fame. Big pimpin.
I remember getting a hug from my friend (ex-friend for many years) When she did give me a hug, my dog was mega jealous and seemed pretty upset too. We saw her and said “Is she being jealous because we’re hugging?” So we hugged again, turns out she was jealous and we started laughing. Good times.
Heck you dad 💅
That dog knows what he wants. 😆😆😆
Sooo, is he looking for a hug, or just jealous?  I have a wolf/malamute hybrid(more malamute) and his giant goofy butt does this.  Like, all the time
That bow tie collar is cool
My boyfriends dog got extremely jealous when my bf hugged me and gave me a kiss on the cheek. The dog trotted over and sat down next to us and started crying and whimpering. He's a pretty big dog too and when he decided enough is enough he jumped up and licked me over and over. Turns out he wasn't jealous that I was the one getting attention from his owner, but he was jealous that I gave my bf kisses and he didn't get any right that second. He followed me around for like 20mins after that.
That’s exactly what he wanted that’s crazy 😂😂
Never let your dog be ALPHA, and they usually accept that. However they will always fight for that second in charge. And getting in middle of hugs, or always taking central position on floor is that "soft fighting" for that beta position. Try another situation with that dog, give him\her food then hug and see if food is more important than hugs.
Hekk you dad 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"hekk u dad" lol 😂
🤦‍♂️
hekk you dad was amazing
not sure why it can not be more respectful of your relationship with the kids and tbe father, YOu have more in your life than the dog, you have other responsibilties,  The owner has to pay for, pick up the poo, walk, feed, entertain and amuse the dog, pay the vets bills of the dog, this dog is lucky and is cared for, many dogs get abandoned,
My dog does the same
Gotta give him some love too man
That's the same dog that will chew his face off one night when he's passed out drunk. Sleep with one eye open from now on.
I tried to tell my ex that our dane she slept with was my dog.  We hug, he'd separate us. I push or play slap her, dog go after HER! Good boy!
♥️♥️♥️ॐ♥️♥️♥️
I wish i could turn into a dog
Is the wife’s name actually linda
He's definitely a mamas boy
“Hekk you dad”   LMAO
The puppy said "Hekk u dad"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legends eyes are on target😅😜😜
That must be annoying! Wtf
Our pit is the same! My husband can just lay his hand on my leg & that gets him going. We call him the Mr. clingy because I have to cuddle him all the time & most definitely better not cuddle with any one but him. His name is Duke 🥰
Next  : Hug your dog and see what your partner does.?
Lol when he said am huggable that got me down 😂
😍😍😍
Tucker:hug me too Linda:ok
i thought dog try to mate with her
I want in on the action!
Omg 😱 I just realized something I have a puppy that jumps on me and my husband the puppies name is Eugene he’s adorable 🥰
This works laying down too
im going through some stuff right now and I'm so glad I found your channel. Thank you so much
they’re soo cute lol i want one
Doggo wants summa dat azz too😏
most stray dogs cry at night with howling sounds remembering their past human lives and their mistakes that made them suffer now 😭 pls feed/love them unconditionally.
That's so cute !!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The way you have to tippy toe lol
He was like “hugs are my specialty” 😂 what a cute goldy, plus the bowtie, he be breaking hearts out here.
This has happened to me😃
😄 sweet baby
His coat is beautiful, you guys!
what da dog doin
This is why I want one
these videos are cute but the subtitles are unnecessary, cringe and irritating.
And that is why I am a cat Person.
Dog whiles better than a partner male or female in life
I label this as, psychological animal cruelty
It's not just your dog that does that.
Look how jealous doggo gets. Adorable
He was like Linda answer me  dame it 😩😭😭😭😩☠️😩
man was standing like a Sims character at the beginning of the video
My dog is so jealous😂😭 of the babies and everything
Dawwwww what a guy! Lolol ❤️❤️❤️
What ! Wait ! Isn't it clickbait In thumbnail she has wore White dress  In actual video --> It is black !
I love ur vids❤️
Am I invisible? Hey! Hug! Me! 😂😂
... aww I will do that too if I was him!¡¡¡!!!!
🤩🤣
😊😍😊😜💓💓💓
My dog just does a playful bark lol
No arse. Downvote!
My two dogs do the same. Whenever me and my sisters group hug without them they either bark or jump up like “excuse you. You really gonna do that like I’m not standing right here?” Lol 😂
The little bowtie killed me uwu
Can I has?
I wants hug hahaha
I can tell the husband was enjoying this experiment a bit too much.
You two just look like siblings with that wired hug
Thats why I may love and have dog but will detest labradors forever cuz they are stupid animals that will eat ur house if u go to work and leave this miserable beasts alone
Wants, has  Are you sure?
Hug your sugar daddy, Mrs. gold digger.
I hate that stupid robot voice it's annoying as f
the dog’s grammar is hilarious: “can I has?” 😂😂😂
adorable
Dogs do that to protect their owners because they think the hugs are them fighting since dogs don’t know what hugs are, so they go in to split them up out of their primal protective nature, good dog in the video
This made my morning lessgo
Hug your partner? Like business partner?
Give the good boy his hug
SMASH AF 🍌
Guys always have to wear a hat
Love how his name’s Tucker and he has a bow tie 😂
I have a Great Dane that does this
This is what my husband does when I hug my dog.
I never touch a dog in my entire life and i’m only 18 . but my cat is also like that dog . she would meow for soo long until someone hug her she would stop meowing. i think it’s because she is a mixed of british short hair and persian cat
Yours is so sweet. Mine nibbles my ass, injects his way into us and nose boops me. He's a German Shepherd and he's an asshole 🤣🤣🤣
My dog is the exact same, but then doesn't want to be hugged.
Sus
Trucker is jealous
My dog don’t give a 💩
That bow collar sure is cute🇨🇦
"I wants"?
How can a Dog even be so sweet and lovable. ❤️
I'd like to see what he does when they....
I used to piggyback mine and sometimes carry it like a baby
Love it when he sat when she said what😘
The hug didn’t seem so genuine. He seemed really cringe
Just doesn't want to be left out 🤣
Awesome! Love it!😍
Hekk u dad
Imagine having someone to hug
I don't think Edgar would even care if Felix and marzia hug each other
Tucker rocks!
The fact that the partner was getting so red 😭😳
Beautiful dog
Husband? He has no ring on. Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free. All these empowered ladies saying I don’t need to get married. Their boyfriends are saying you go strong women, nah we don’t need to get married laughing his way to their bed. What a foolish population.
You’re lucky My dog full blown humps
I hate that intro voice, it's gotta go
Why does this happen its just so typical....
Hug the boi
Old shep telling it how it is .
I really hate that voice
This is EXACTLY what our dog does, whenever anyone in my family either hugs each other, or hugs someone else (like me and my girlfriend) our dog would either yell at us, or jump on us to get our attention, she's a very jealous dog 😅
I counldnt read at first so i thought tucker said: we doin dr-gs? Cool
ITS I’m NOT am
The way a non-dog person sees it, he wants to mount you...🤗
😋
The fact that tucker felt left out 🤣😭😭
He seems to be so uncomfortable with this 😂 (the boyfriend)
Love how is tail moves sooo fast when u gave him a hug finally 🌟🌟🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
My mans a fur bomb
I wish my dog was more chill like that he will just run and chump into the hug like John Cena
❤️
Same pinch ! 😊
That’s my German Shepard when I am anywhere near my wife.
Thats why its better to be a single and have a dog.
hekk u dad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how big dogs love hugs and general affection and receive it better than small dogs
Brian griffin’s cousin
The dude: why I'mma doing this *Look at his beautiful wife* The dude: oh yeah right 🥰
Wow , here's something you've seen 1 million times and yet again here's another couple posting this video like it's something new .🤣🤣🤣 what's the matter? Could you not have come up with any worth while content ? Perhaps something that's your own idea? If your brains are capable of that 🤣🤣🤣
This guy should be careful of that dog.
😂👍
"Hek you dad" at last had me
Beautiful video! I love this dog, super cute to insist on hugs from mom!
That's what we play with our little daughter 🤩
🥰🥰🥰
Awww plz hugg mr doggo
Cute 🥰
my dog does this too! does anyone have an explanation for it? is it for attention or concern or something else???
Bad dog , is what that is.
Animals are like little kids. I don't understand how we can treat them the way we do for food, etc.
I wish there was a way to hate these types of videos more extreme
That's mean
Name of this dog breed please?
Those without a partner or a dog: 👁️👄👁️ 💧     💧
What a smashing coat on that doggy
The doggo is almost as tall as her 😨 I never seen dogs this big my sister has a pug at home that's not even the size of my knee
"heckk dad" 🤣
Awwww 😂😭🥰❤️
Too bad my gf left me at night time and took my dog with her. 🥲 I miss you spot. Curse that woman who stole my dog 🥺.
✝️✝️✝️❤️
Awwww!!!
Dogs are jealous animals.
My dog stands to join the hug
This new text to speech voice is really annoying, and I keep hearing it everywhere.
That looks like the most awkward forced hug ever
Dogs do this because they assume we are fighting. As dogs do not hug in the dog world. Its typically used to suppress another in a dominance display
“ Hekk You Dad “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂
God bless him
That’s about the sweetest thing I ever saw 🥰
lol they wouldn’t be so inclusive if this was further down the hug road and all stark
I want a hug as well
My Labradoodle does the exact same thing
Dangggg what a ****block.. poor husband 😂😂
Hi
Aww.. such a cute dog. So adorable.  ☺
Bork bork
Dog just used to seeing her being huged by everyone.........I was one of them
I couldn’t resist. I’d drop everything to hug that dog.
I love Tucker and all his friends. He seems so happy with you!
My Yorkie is the same way if anyone but him is getting attention 🤣
Omgg so cute
Everybody : Watches Dog.  Me : Watches Girl
What the dog doin ?
My girlfriend's golden does that as well
I miss watching him

❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨😍🤩🤩🤩😍😍 *HE IS SO CUTE!!!!!* 🥰
wonder what he would do if they were doing the deed
We don't deserve dogs
Lol this is what my dog does straight human dogs
Lol
My Chihuahua Klaus use to eagerly start air humping at the slightest sign of affection between my wife and I. He was a instigator.
Our corgi would bark and lose her ever loving mind. Immediately
Our does the same
Husband was like “I now have a chance to be in the vid!”
My puppy does the same thing! She gets so jealous every time my bf and I hug or cuddle. She always finds a way to wedge herself between us lol
I hate woman voice at the start of every tiktok video its so cringe
Are dogs do the samething
I am not doing this with my dog bc my gf will stop hugging me for the dog instantly and second the dog scratches me after 10 seconds of hugging my gf and not her
My daughter cracked up 😂
he want more than a hug, if u know what i mean
No quiere un abrazo. Quiere acapararla a ella
Why are u hugging your brother for so long..
Oh my gosh I always thought it was only my dog that barks when we hug🥲
You just know.
Ew
Cute doggie
The dogpill is overwhelming
They dont needs kids lol
The "voice (text) of the dog" is annoying .. sorry... Just let the dog bark... It is that animals form of talking 🤷‍♂️
Computer voice is tik tok cancer
I would hug her from behind ..
That behaviour is sus
Hug the fucking doG!!!!
“Hekk u dad” is so accurate hahaha
Imagine what  if ur wife cheat on u with ur dog 😅😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣
He is cute
Hekk u dad   Cracked me up🤣
So wholesome
I was gonna say if you don’t hug the doggie I will. lol  That’s is one gorgeous dog.
This is adorable
“My dog will do ANYthing for peanut butter”
Wait until he walks in on you guys
lol 😂 the dog was go under both of your ***** bruh
His is jeilious
Mr Tucker here 👉🏻🐶 wants a hug
I want a hug like ur husband too
When you dog from between your legs that mean he is showing affection
My dog barks at us when we hug she wants to steal attention
Yeah, it's okay YouTube. I know I'm single... :/
ugh, dog is so needy..
That store bought “Homemade” sign tells you all you need to know.
Dog in the boton is preety weird XD
Lol, who noticed the dog want to hug the guy?
My dog usually stays in the middle if we hug
Give him sume hugs too
Oh disgusting!
I love dogs. I have two German Shepherds. Ursula and Ranger they are great. I got Ursi when she was 6 weeks old. People did not want her cause she was sick and dying. I took her and had her at the vets. The vet gave her medicine, shits and dewormer. After two months she was well. Now she is 2.5 years old.
Put ur partners dog in the grinder and c how she reacts
Hug your neighbor and see how your husband reacts 🤷‍♂️
I think dogs get more hug than humans.....its been 3 years i didnt get hug from partner or any friends. Well do i even hav one I hav lost my memory on that.
Dogs don't like people hugging because they think you're fighting eachother.  They don't like it lol
わんこ　かわいいですね。戦後最悪の安倍菅政権で日本がめちゃくちゃですね。国難安倍が決めた令和になってから災害ばっかりで　いいこと何一つありませんね。
…
Some people are just incredible at doing doggy -> English translations. This translation was perfect - the intonation, the spelling. Spot on.
She's a cheat...
🙈🙉🙊🤣
Beautiful dog.
Very well groomed
Animal subtitles are cringe
I hope everyone who uses baby talk on animal videos gets cancer.
Dog wants to be loved and get attention too. 🐶❤
Our cat does the same thing.  He will give you the paw and show you the why don't you love me eyes.
My gf has a cognitively handicapped brother who does this too when we hug 🥰 he’s adorable!
Your grammer😂
That’s a fit ass. That’s the only reason this video was made she is conceded
This is because they think you are fighting
This has gotta be awkward in the bedroom.
Incredible doggo
Now that’s a Golden!!! Love it!! 👍❤️
What about Sex? 🤭
Love he  is  cuts  and  Love  it
Disgusting
So cute 🐕
The is the best.
😂🤣🧡
Tucker ahhhhhhhhhhhhh i cant stand the dogs cutenes
Poor Tucker
I'm pretty sure you're a witch and you turned your ex-boyfriend into a golden retriever (and decided to keep him). No wonder he's jealous!
Hi. l dig fam
Aww 🥺💕
Beaful
Wooooww ,,,,he is sooo funny....🤗🥰❤❤❤
He only wants to hug her tho lol

Jesus loves you amen .
Just hug the dog already!! *.*
Hi Skaya how is your dog.
He is so loooong
Well, he seemingly considers you're "his" and, thus, he of course should have priority for the hugs... ^^
Tuker: hecck you dad
Imagine having both of those things
Can anyone tell me which dog type is this dog
Why would I hug my husband if my dog is there
😊 Jesus is King for ever and ever. Dont forget it, becuase its always going to be true. You get two choices onto how to live your life, with Jesus or with out Jesus. You have to pick there’s no avoiding it. So figure it out, to be with a holy and kind God, Or go with something else.  Your free will, you free choice. Make one. 😊
It’s  so funny 🤣
Aww tucker im gonna hug u<3
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Tucker is so mean to his dad lol
Tucker doesn't wanna be left out...too cute...loveable & smart!
Beautiful dog
I hate when people subtitle their pets.

Doggy wants a hug
Meanwhile the dad awkwardly patting the dog
Wholesome
Tucker is so silly, but very smart!!
I like how the white cat puts a hand out and tries to hit him to shut up hahahahaha
My dog when I get home from schoo🤣
Poor guy .. being used only to make the dog feel jealous..lol
this is dogs alertness of danger. Dogs dont understand hugs or human way of showing physical affection. For them hugging is perceived as dangerous act towards their loved ones. He is clearly trying to separate you from your partner.
I mad too tuck when my mom and dad hug
That is soo cute which also means ur dog cares about y
Very cute dog
My golden puppy used to do so💓. Unfortunately he died a month ago 😭
How dare you ignore him 😁
The tiger woods cap reminds me of king of queens
🥰
Lol. She looks so much like Talia that I thought this video was from the Scott Fam channel. That’s why I clicked.   However, I wasn’t disappointed that it wasn’t the Scott Fam and now I’m subscribed to this channel as well.
My dogs just go mental barking n jumpin
MY DOG DOES THIS  :0000
“Heck u dad” 😂😂😂😂
Meanwhile my dog: k i dont really care
That's a shgg non a hagggg🤣🤣🤣
I installed tucker moji
Very funny 🤣😂😆
Hears the tik tok tts lady and immediatly leaves
Omg adorable!!
Sometimes m in mom starts pooping m in pimples while I scream in pain ,and sometimes my golden pup reacts by barking and biting her (playfully of course)
Tuck is havin none of this!
Epic 👍
😂 Love ❤️ it
How funny!  Cracked me right up!
Could have found a real man
I prefer when linnda hugs tucker
Tucker is more curious than jealous, he’s like: Hekk yeah, can I join?
54
😄😍😍😍
My dog does the same thing. He will climb between us or even put his paw on one of us.  He will literally get up and come over just cuz we are touching or loving on each other. Now my boyfriend and I have only been together a little over a year and I raised my dog since he was 3 weeks old so maybe that's why but idk
THer dog: EXCUSE ME GIMME HUB TwO
Awe Rucker you are such a handsome man I would give u a million hugs a day you are so adorable&precious I just love your personality much love to you handsome boy from me&my furrybabies
😄
Aww Tucker is the sweetest 🥺
Dog: Am I not enough for you?
yeah when im hugging my mom or dad my dog starts barking 😂😂🤣🤣👽👽
Boo 👎
Listen Linda……
I think someone is jealous 👍☝️👌🤣😃😂😄😅😁😀😆
We’ve got a Portuguese Water Dog and she does the same thing whether I’m hugging my husband or the kids!  Lol.
No partner 😢 No dog 😭
Plot Twist: Tucker doesn’t like PDA
Y’all need to do this with Todd now
My cat can hear my bf and i snuggling from across the apartment. We try to whistle and call her name but soon enough, we learned to just cuddle a bit. Fastest way to summon her. Then she demands a spot in the middle.
My dog dosent give a shit
I would like this to happen to my dog (that i don't have) because it would be a great excuse to hug my wife (that i don't have) for long times.
Dogs are annoying af
Actually dogs don't understand hugs it's a very human thing they think you guys are having a blast but it's still cute
Do you train dogs for a living? The reason why am asking is I was supposed to be getting a service dog five years ago and the trainer that was training name leading insect bite it and it killed him within minutes it was a bad and assassin beetle full of venom. And then I was promised another dog and then that dog didn’t work and I was promised two more dogs those dogs didn’t work and then it’s just been crazy. And I’ve been needing a service dog for a long time and 10 years ago I tried to get one and five years later they told me that they couldn’t help me so I’m just I don’t know I paid that much money for service dog never got it my community help me get me get the dog. Do you have any ideas sorry if the spelling is all wrong I have to talk in my mic

Cool dog, but those moccasins are killing me sir.
This is so bad holy shit
We had a Golden Retriever that would do the same thing. Even if my husband and I sat next to each other he would stare at us until we made room for him or he would squeeze in between us. I sure do miss that pup.
ⁿ⁰no

Lol so cute
Tucker's like back off I need my hug
I hugged my dad infront of our dog (our dog is our dads son since he hasnt had a son) and our dog was so sad looking through the door at us. Our dog's favorite was my dad even though our dad would get mad at him often, the dog even cried whenever our dad would go out to buy or do something
Loool

Have some children geez. Quit putting your dog in a child’s place.
Funny request rofl!!
Na mere paas pet dog hai na partner 🥺🤣
46 op scene was op
Lol
Aww, this was sweet! It reminded me of my Golden Retriever Sammy J. (🌈3/16/06-6/13/19🌈) Boy oh boy, if anyone showed public displays of affection & didn't include him, he'd body slam his way in for some lovin'!😆He was a big boy-105+lbs.  Tucker's SUCH a handsome gent. I can't get enough of him! It's VERY apparent the amount of love he gets on a daily basis not just from his pawfect family, but from all his 2-legged & 4-legged frens! From my Family to yours, much love from Connecticut!💜
Heck u dad 😂
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww so cuteeeeeeeeee
Omg hahahahaha 😂😂😂 tucker he is so jealous
Ever wonder why dogs are assigned with such horrible grammar and pronunciation in videos could it be a reflection of their owners intelligence perhaps just wondering
He's jealous 🤣
You do you make your dog sound stupid? He is probably smarter than the two of you.
Care the dog
My heart ❤
If the dog is male then he’ll definitely get jealous of a male partner of a girl.
❤️
People like you , it's just as Allah said .
Cringe
So cute
Post some Beastiality actions
From Indonesia, very happy to see tucker and linda...hehehe
Tucker  is not dads biggest fan 😊😅😅😅
I just DO NOT understand high waste paints. The least flattering fashion statement of all time possibly?
Tucker is submissive and huggable
Yay is right!
Hekk u dad lol
Haha 😂
stop narrating the dog, its not funny at all its too agitating.
How old is your husband? 17?
😃😃😃❤❤❤
The moment I saw the most adorable necktie I would have folded. Immediately

Hekk you dad 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Mine goes between my legs when I’m petting da female

Hit Like if you like this.!😊
You my toddler does something similar to this, but it involves slapping and latching onto my leg yelling "no" or "wake up" (still haven't figured that one out yet lol. And then makes one of, usually me pick her up and if I'm holding her and go to hug him, she shoves him away from us lol
‘Can I has’ HAS to be a typo cos I can’t take my mind of the blunder😂 believe me I tried.
This is so funny cuse the dog don't even want a hug 🤣🤣😂 He thinks they are fighting so he is trying to break them up by getting their attention to something else. Still really cute behaviour.
“Heck u dad” 😂🤣
This dog is moder and easily catch anyone feelings
"nothing like a daddy hug"  Excuse me?
Lol! My Golden does the exact. Same. Thing. 😂 *bork* *bork* *bork* lol.
That hekk u dad had me in tears 😂😂😭😭
He is a mommy’s bOy
OMG this is our dog too!
He is a beautiful dog.
By your voice & name, I did not expect you to look like this.  You're much younger than I expected
Wat da dog doin
We have a female golden retriever
When i hug my mom my dog kills me 😂

I can’t hug anyone in my house because of my dog
😂😂
Man that looked like one awkward hug 🫂
I also have a dog he reacts same as tucker 😁😁😅🤣
I huged my partner and my dog showed his middle finger
Sweet Linda hahaha
This is why i love my dogs more than most human beings ❤️
ORRRRRR SOO CUTEEEE
I feel like dogs are always happy because, they know they don't have long a lifetime. So their motto is, live you life happy.
I’m*
Love this
🤣 hekk you, dad! Oh, this is super cute. I'm lol. 🥰
Lol I had a dog that did the same anytime I hugged my fiance. One time we were on the sofa my fiance put his head on my lap to my right. Guess who climbed up to my left and laid his head on my lap too? Lol the fur babies can be so awesome.
What da dog doin?
Mid husband I can treat you better
Fun fact the dog is trying to separate them, because he thinks they are fighting.
Fact that linda is on her tippy  toes
Heccin ripoff 🤣🤣🤣
Stuck between four leg
Dum
I'm the dog in this situation
He wants a hug so bad🤣🤣
😂🤣😂🤣... 👍
Y'all have a beautiful family
Dogs are so useless. Thank goodness I don't have a pet in my house.
😆😆😍👍🖐🖐🖐
Very Funny
Just like Apollo..
🤣 Every time my kids come and sit in my lap my fur baby is not far behind. She will not be left out!
When my parents hug each other all five of our dogs bark hysterically 😓
Is it just me who feels like this voice makes them want to commit war crimes
Do the same with babies, they want an immediate hug too
I can see that most dogs will want a hug from that honey.
My boyfriend's dog is a jealous fucker. I hug my bf. I kiss him. Show him any affection and the dog will jump on and bark at my bf.   He wants all the attention.
0:00 he looks older than u o.O
Hekk u dad BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
❤️❤️❤️😂🇬🇷
He’s too cute!
And the maker of this video needs grammar lessons 🤣🤣
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺   Come here they meanie peepoow!! They nasty hoomans wont give you hugzies!!!! I gives you cuddows i gives you wove… poow baby awwwww
Tucker  😭 😭 😆
Pets arent genuine. That doggo didn't need hug before that. Faker doggo. No genuine feelings.
What i don't have a partner
Hug? Wierd
Dogs a male.
Epic xd
Incorrect title it should be “What I do when mom hugs dad.”
She has a husband? 🤔😳😂
Precious!
So cute
The dogs like “let me in on that action”
Cosby does this too
HES SO FLUFFY
Too Funny lol
Jealously jealously is on the line right now
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
All I can do is sit here and wonder how much Ill need to sacrifice to buy that fridge and the house to fit it in.
My dog does the same
Don't lie we all know we are watching something else than the dog
Your dog doesn't want competition. I bet it's a male dog. It's weird that women specifically choose male dogs.....
What an idiotic idea to make the dog speak, but with wrong grammar as if it was a person with language problems.
When I hug my husband my little dog gets defensively mad at him for hugging me
Sure sure doing it for the dog
Don’t be jealous Tucker I’ll hug ya 💗😂
Not uncommon at all, every dog from puppy I've ever owned have done the same thing.
Our dog does exactly the same thing, straight away jumps up to join in haha
Damn she fine as hell...lol
My dog just barks at my parents
My dog bark louder as much as he can
😍😍🤗🤗🤗
So beautiful and clear dog.i want to hug him inmedietely
Yay my youtuber 💖 💓 💕 💗 ♥ ❤
Gross
Same with Labradors.
Lindo tucker
My golden does the same thing. Shoves me out the way to hug my mom! 😂😂😂
Your man gay for not hugging that ah
He wants a hug LOL 😆
Besides those that comment on the fighting theory their is a research that conducted that   Dogs actually display jealousy when their owners give more attention to others then Themselves, so while the first theory of fighting implies to un-humanized dogs.  The second theory implies to domesticated dogs typically.
I’m not sure how the dog would react but I have a good idea how I would .
My dog does the same thing lol it’s not cuz he wants a hug it’s cuz he thinks u guys are fighting/wrestling and he holds ur back to pull u away Lol tell him to pick u up, the dog will try to pull u down the same way. My dog always does this lol 😂
Sick of this partner bullshit.   A partnership is an agreement to enter into a business for profit. When the company dissolves assets are split up 50/50. Husband and wife is not a fucking partnership. Lmfao
🥰🥰
the fact that your watching this vid in your bed 🛏️ lol
😍😍😍
We just had to put our dog to sleep and this video reminds me of how he would always want to be part of our hugs. :-(
Doggo
It's funny cuz my dog is worse than that, we do it to play with hwr it's so funny she even start barking cuz she wants attention😂😂😂😂
😀😀😀😀😀😀
The biggest drama I've seen
I need lots of love and hugs!❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
RIP Grammar
It's the hecking rip-off for me😂😂😂😂
wanted to let you guys know Jesus died to forgive your sins. receive that free gift and choose life, have a good day
❤❤
Awwww so cute 💓💓💓
Can we talk about how handsome that the golden retriever is with his bowtie? Hes so god damm cute
Yep. Whenever my parents pretend to be all lovey, dovey and snuggly in front of our dog, she immediately gets jealous and starts trying to get inbetween them while licking their faces.
Not only is Tucker hek*n awesome ‘cause he’s a golden, he’s even better with his good boi tie! Yup.
that is so nice😆😅
Dogs get jealous .. my little sister used to have a toy that she would carry around all the time.. our dog got jealous of the toy and tore it apart..😂
May be I was only one waiting for kiss 🙄
Funny when she said whats that, lol he start looking like what, lol
i like how he says hekk u dad when he tries to hug tucker LMAO
I dont have dog and partner so this video is waste of time for me
Who wants to hug me?  Thinking about this I can't remember the last time I hugged someone. I am male 19, btw.
GIVE THAT HECKIN POOCH A HUG BEFORE I DO IT MYSELF.
My lab is the same, must be a retriever thing! They don’t care what’s going on as long as they are involved!
"hekkin ripoff!"
Cute dog and cute couple
Lol yes , because why is he not involved too? Lol my pup is serious about his loving.
Poor tucker 😂😂😂
The dog Want His creepy piece 😁😂
butifull  dog 😍 😍 ❤ 👍
啊啊啊啊啊真的很喜歡金毛 溫柔毛毛的又大隻
Simple dog behaviour: the dog is jealous of the husband because the dog thinks the wife is HIS bitch.
Same thing on bed??lame
So fun...😃
Yup that  happends to my go to Golden retriever name   Simba he do that
Tucker makes her look short… Anyone else think the same thing?
That guy should do another experiment.  Just to make sure the dog acts the same way.
Tucker Buzyn looks handsome with the bow tie
What's the dogs breed?
Dog jealous. “Me hug too!”
That dog probably wants more than a hug like food a walk
Woof woof            I want a hug too girl...
What's that in my back This is such a stupid video come on We all know it's all fake so corny
THIS AMAZING FURY FRIEND IS BLESSED!!!! VERYYYY LOVING FAMILY.🤗 VERYYY LOVING FURY FRIEND. TUCKERRR I ADORE YOU❤
I also wanna hug
El tambien quiere abrasó que rico
My grandmas dog jumps up when any of us try to hug my cousin ;—;
Tucker is the perfect chunk boi ever
Mom jeans.  Why?!?!?!
Dogs do that because they think that your fighting so they try to make you stop fighting by doing that it’s not because they are jealous ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kill this Dog 😠🤬
That last line ( heck you dad ) 😂😂
Same with one of my dogs as well. Most strange was that if a heated discussion with family members happened he jumped in between us.
Instructions unclear my family has cat
Lol
That dude is punching well above his weight.
This is what I do too when my wife hugs her husband
How could you not love a dog??
You should call his name and act like he's invisible so you just keep saying his  name
My dog does it too when i hug my dad. My dog's breed is shih tzu poodle
Include your dog wth
Love the dog so sweet😀
Linda.. .really Linda.  I aint playing with u as we have already discussed this lol.
I agree with the dog, you should ditch the dud and hug the dog
I can make my dog freak out by just telling the couch pillow I love it and pretend to cuddle it.
That is such an incredible dog. Give him all the hugs and loves! He seems so special. I love it
I don’t know what’s cuter, the fact that he was jealous, or his cute little blue bow collar
Anytime I pet another dog, my danesky playfully bites the dog and stops it immediately.
My pitbull was the exact same way . But every time me and my twin get into an argument she would get in between us and separate us 😂
I'm a simple man,  I see a tiktok video, i dislike.
Moi aussi,moi aussi !
When my bf and I kiss his beagle always comes because she also wants kisses
She's good looking.  And the woman ain't bad either
Peek
I want a hug like this too 😂
I wouldn't like that at all, it's bloody creepy
Stop hugging him then. Its not gunna last anyway (mark my words).  Get yourself a jar of peanut butter girl.
Dumb 😁
Aapreen bosri b kuta na daisay?
So sweet
Jealous fellow.
Boy friend
Why do they have different clothes in the thumbnail wtf
😂🤣hahahaha kute hi
What de dog doin
They are like a cute family 💗💗
Cool
The dog is allways between her legs , in bed
This video taught me important lesson in my Life I was missing since birth. I can't thank to the creator because this is something beyond thanks.
It may be possible that u have given him lollypop for something,he want something like u give ur husband, he has no wife so he want to fulfill his requirement with u
Same !
Her boyfriend is a huge stereotype i
Dat ass
A cat would take the opportunity to grab the softest  chair & pretend to be asleep.
So cute wth bro
Lol
Awwww, what about me, 🥺😂💕
The same happens with my cat when I hug my mother.
Precious
I doubt he wants a hug lol
I have a big Irish doodle. Whenever anybody hugs someone, he hope up and places his paws on our shoulders so he can get in on it
God loves u and we must spread his gospel.
I'm a simple mam. I see doggo I click video.
Aw he wants a hug too🤩
The husband could have at least hugged the dog too :/
Awwww he’s so cute
Extinction here we are
Pervert dog
Why so many dislikes?
What a big beautiful fluffy doggie💕
It looks lik you are kissing
What the dog doin
My dog does this as well she is a great pyr.. It always amazes me because exchanging affection and jealousy are generally human traits..
It shouldn’t be partner,what’s the company called?),it should be husband and wife if they are properly married otherwise it’s fornication and you belong to the evil one and could lose your immortal soul’s. If a person wilfully rejects the holy Catholic Church they are damned it’s as simply as that. Please watch the warning or illumination of conscience by Christine Watkins. Then The Papacy can not be destroyed. Also a video entitled Don’t call protestant’s Christian. God bless all those who do live together-I beg you to stop and get married. Praise Jesus and Mary always!!!
Aw so sweet this.🙏❤️
Golden Retrievers are just the Happiest Dogs ever
Ok yeah yeah but turn a bit to my left
The tough hail scilly retire because sword directly multiply past a delicious tramp. soggy, panicky chest
Is that tom?
There’s no way that’s your husband, it must be your son. You look 20 years older than him 🤦‍♂️
Linda hugs Heckk you dad   😂😂😂😂
Thumbnail looks like a bestiality DP.
Oof
If only I could hug my German Shepherd the way this girl hugged her Golden Retriever  😂😩😩
Heck you dad lol
Why can the dog not spell though?
I'll give u a space hug 🙇‍♀️
So so cute dog
RECITE KALMA SHAHADAT TO accept ISLAM & OBEY ALLAH for ACHIEVING YOUR OWN HEAVEN also FORGIVENESS FROM ALLAH. CONVEY this Message to OTHERS STAY BLESSED AMEEN.... ACCORDING TO PROPHET MUHAMMAD PEACE BE UPON HIM.

"Heck you dad" 😂😂
Even I had puppy even he will do like that
Nice white bottom
So sweet ❤❤❤
Incase if you have a dog and need a partner  I'm single
Whenever I hugged my mom as a kid my dog would jump on us and start biting me because he thought I was attacking her
D😁
Cute dog 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Their dog is so cute🥺
Affectionate gestures like hugging don't exist in the canine world and they often interpret it as an act of aggression.
The dog is jealous ...maybe... 😅
Too cute❤😍
Partner or Husband
Not in Nigeria
Cute🥺🥺
Im weak omg 😂😂😂😂
my dog is with my sister and niece for a little bit and he gets so jealous about the little baby just coming up to my sister lol.
Ow🤗
What da dog doin?!
He is funny
Repent Jesus is coming back not forcing though.......
I like how tucker says “not again” implying that he’s been invisible before
Love this! 💖💖💖
Oh i love this video here. Too sweet
This is what dogs do when they need views on YouTube.
“I LUV MUM HUGS, screw u dad”
My dog does same he gets jealous asf he’s a attention hog cute asf lol
After about 3 seconds of watching, I’m thinking:  ok that’s enough, the joke’s over, hug your dog!!!!
This how the Friendzone feels 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nothing special here, been going on since dogs were around
Cuteeeeeeeeee
Dog sees owner giving hugs: Can i has hugs? Me seeing this beautiful dog: Can i has hugs?
You're both lucky boys.
Just give him hug
She needs to work on her dog’s grammar…
The third wheel
I like his posture
👉👈❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My dog does this worse
I like the part when Tucker says hekk you dad.
Mine gets between us he's huge
I love you’re dog he looks cute with his bow tie
Now I know why John Wick has to kill for a fxing dog
Hahahaha😄😂🤣🥰🌹🐕🌻🍀
Elijah
Why is this like the cutest thing I’ve seen all day.
My pooch does the same thing. If I start scratching my gf’s head she makes a beeline and stops me. Then I have to scratch her all over.
That dog like I smell peanut butter
Sweet dog , baby ❤️❤️❤️😘😘
Hek u dad😂😂😂😂🤣
Tucker Budzyn you and your wife Linda Budzyn are both Loko
HUG HUG SOME MORE LAH😚😙😘😗😘🤩😍🥰 TAKE CARE GUYS
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I see nothing funny here. don't manipulate the feelings of your animal! yes, they have feelings too, also as human!
0:01
Disturbing
Our doggy is doing exactly the same, nobody can get a hug until he gets he's hugs first 😂
LOL, our goldie ALWAYS wants to be in the action with damn-near anything we do! Can TOTALLY relate!
My grandparents staffy humps their legs when they are hugging 😂😂😂
That's not cute. That's a sure sign your dog owns you nor the other way around. You should ALWAYS be alpha & your dog as a pack animal by nature should know his place in the pack order. Sounds cruel but it's the healthiest relationship both mentally for them & physically for you & your entire family. Even the baby should outrank the dog. If you teach them pack order from the start they will automatically know it & become a protector of the little ones not a danger to the little ones.
Repent for your sins to God,Jesus Christ, The Angels and the Holy Spirit
The dog has identified the fact that she is way to hot for this guy and thinks he has a chance.
Aww
Lovely dog.  I apologize for the digress... But I'd appreciate your routine that made that dog so fresh, clean and healthy-looking.
Tucker is sooo cute! Golden retrievers are the best types of dogs!! They are so friendly and cute!
What da dog doin
Look how she was standing on her feet! she's so cute ❤
I think the dog is just pleading with you to stop forcing him to wear ridiculous bow ties.  Such a handsome dog without the tie.
My pitbull starts humping the air or twerking lol.
Any white woman with a big male dog has dog something sexual with it. Guarantee that 100 percent
MY DOG LIKE SCREAMS
Dogs are smart and lovable ♥️
I am 100% certain tucker actually speaks English
That hair yo. Beautiful GR.
Alternate title: *try not to think of your crush challenge*
This dog is so adorable!!
The is literally not interested in you ,someone forced him to go there
"Hekk dad" Lmao that was so perfect 😂
😍😍
Aww
The dogg talking subtitles are so cringe
The dog wanna hug too. So hillarious
🤣👍
Same with my dog when I try to hug my dad. Sometimes he even follows me-
Either they trained their dog to do this or they haven't. At the end the dog even gets praised for his action.
When I give my brother piggy back rides he thinks it’s a good idea to pull his pants so he falls
😄😄😅😅
Hi
its not good to call mommy by name, not even her real name.. you call your dad 'dad' but momma ,"LINDA"...??? why mister?
Pliz no Ray Mak Comment🙏🙏😂😂😂
Is the dog male or female?
LOL!! When me and my ex-wife used to playfully wrestle, our dog started humping my ex-wife!! LOL!!
Tucker:Linda hug  Also Tucker:hekk you dad  Me:..........WHAT
Doggo just wants some love you flthy hoomans.
He’s prob more like “get that stupid bow tie off my neck” 😂
My dogs hates it to be pet...
I love Tucker 😂
"Can i has?" what the fuck does that mean?
I think the dogo follows what his master maded at night
"hug your partner and see how your dad reacts"😮  dad: are you winning son?
LOL
Just a reminder that the word "partner" is *_plutonic_* ! It comes from the Latin word for "partition". God, people don’t know how to use words properly. 🤦‍♂️
"nothing like a dady"
This is what happens when you spend toooo much alone time with your dog
Jealousy????
"Heck u dad" lmao im lost 🤣
Give me 20 dollars i want to go into town and find a bar .I will meet other doggies and be self sufficient.Also i need your car keys mum.
OMG Lina! Your dog is so cute!!
Qaqqqqqqqqqq Q A  Q
Tucker darling i wanna take you home. ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘
So cute
Wow Linda be tip towing the whole time
Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Men will be men
Lol my pup doesnt take a no when it comes to participating on hugs. You don't let him join he nearly knocks you over. Luckly we are safe if he doesn't know who we are hugging well enough.
How did he get her tho
My dog will just bark at us nonstop until we are finished hugging.
Lol. When he says hekk u dad. That made me cry laughing. 😂😂😂😂
Aaaawww. . That is so special and sweet doggies wanting some love too.......👍 xoxoxo.    .🐕🐕
Dogs are so precious & pure. They must be protected.
YOU HAVE A SUPER FRIENDLY CUTE DOG
Things a cat will never do.
Look out how he’s wagging his tail at the end, he’s so happy 🥲
Hek u dad part made me laugh 😭🖐
This is the most love I have ever seen a husband get from his wife. Too bad its not real, oh well.
“Hug your partner” partner. Lol. Lefters
Stupid people treating dogs like people. You should be training it not to jump up and not to be jealous of human relationships. This is dependency and BAD TRAINING.  On the plus side, these sorts of people won't get a chance to breed since they need to have the dog around at all times interrupting any attempt at intimacy with its clingy neediness and foul hygiene stinking up the place.
Yep I stil dont understand hugs
Can I please know the dog's breed
😭❤️
My husband and I will always include our ginger girl in our hugs and my cat violet too lol it’s a true family hug right there😂😂😂😂
Dogs have no business in the house !  Don't do that !!! Its u godly !  Whos the big dog , of the relation ship ???  These actions create confusion and Kaos for both pet , & owners !  Keep animal's out of human affections for one another,  or their will be hell to pay !  This is bi libblical truths from abba !
Aweeee
That robotic voice is annoying af! It’s everywhere!
I think I'd be jealous too, everybody needs a Linda.
How did that black dress changed to white? That my question here.
Don't be cruel hug your dog!
How come dogs say "can I has?" ?  Does something in their jaw structure prevent them from pronouncing a "v" sound?
Hekk u dad 😂😂😂
Linda: Aww you feel so bad? Ok i'll hug you! Dad: I cant get doggo fur on my favorite suit! Tucker: Linda hugs! Hekk you dad!
Next reaction on lion 👍
I thinks tucker asking for treats
My pitbull is so jealous, she never wants me and my partner to be close. She has to be in the middle of us. Y'alls dog is so adorable!
I think they're going to trick Tucker
gay
ME A HUGE FAN OF………….TUCKER!
Dog surprised  that he have Husband ,what I am ,?
Goldens always do this!!they are love bugs and want all the love!
I want to be hugged so bad man
Awwww he wants in!!!
Omg my pitbull does the exact same thing, he never let's me hug anyone in peace. He's a big softie who just wants love🤣🤣
🤢🤮
Tucker is so funny
You can tell that the really really take care of their dog but that's the most beautiful golden retriever I've ever seen in my life
If he has to wear a blue bow tie, then he at least deserves a hug.
I am that dog 24/7. 😭
I looovvee lovey babies.
I love the fact they're so loyal and loving. Nice clip and beautiful pup.
Such a jealous dog. Lol
Awwww I really wish I had a dog, or any pet. You guys don't know how lucky you are if you have one. To have someone you know you can go all the time who isn't just your identical twin sister that you know practically everything about because you share the same rooms, clothes, beds, bathroom, and basically everything. You can literally almost guess what they will reply/react to something you said. Anyways, you guys with pets are lucky. And cute dog by the way!! 😊
Reminds me of when I hugged my girlfriend...her husband got upset when he saw us. 😂
🥰🥰🥰
"Hug your partner and see how your dog reacts!"  Me: *Forever single and no doggo yet :/*
Shocking but even the dog is like 100 times more alpha then the beta boyfriend 😂
What about me? I WANT HUG TOO
Fake...the dog is a paid actor
Why is the dog only mounting her?  Maybe I'm just under the weather  Dont mind me
Hug that good polite dog Woman.
My dogs normal so nothing happens
Whassup with the cheesy doggy subtitle
Well the dog is sure hugging you 😂😂😂
Hakk you dad 🤣🤣🤣
"Hekkk u dad" 😂
hekk you dad
legend says once this dog dies, humanity will fall into abrupt depression
I think he wants to drill that asz not a hug
Pets are parts and parcel of the family .  they express love  through  all forms    only thing  they  cant speak    if they  can speak then it will be another  level of   love .   lucky you are .
He says don't make me feel like a 3rd wheel here.
Super cute family
International hug day sponsored by your YouTube channel;)
He’s so cute
My golden  is the same way. Dogs got to get in on everything.
Not right to have anyone or an animal meddle into a marriage like that.
when me and my mom hug my dog comes in between our legs LOL
Ke tenero!...E' geloso😊😍😍😍💓💓💓
awwww!!🤗🤗🤗🤗❤❤ he gets hugs too
Awwwww how sweet!!!
He's so smart 😊
this is normal happens to probably everyone lol
Why he just wants his mother to hug him
yea thats the living male instict sorry the dog tries to fk you if the dog is male haha
“Leave room for Jesus you two”
My golden doodle jumps in between us
Gotta love’em. 🐕
Poor tucker
My dog does the same 😂
Im not kidden but I always experience this when Im on a date with a girl that has a dog, but the dog always wins... and Im the one left out..
Jesus loves you 😊😊 Jesus loves you all, He can remove your emptiness and pain if you let Him. He loves you with a love you didn’t know existed. Give Him a chance, please. He loves you. Do not end your life, please stay. You are so precious, wanted and loved. If you don’t want your life - give it to Jesus. All these lies and torments you hear - flip it and it is the truth! Listen to “Voice of God” and “As you find me” on youtube. Also please listen to: Dan Mohler, Kenneth Hagin, Todd White and Kathryn Kullmann. I hope to see you in heaven one day 😊🤍
White people be like
Now it's time for a baby ...
That's the cutest doggo I've ever seen🥺❤
가족관계증명서1통 필요 하다ㅎ
Jajaja
My dogs do the same thing.  If I kiss my kids and hug them they do the same.  Dogs are funny!
He a jealous boi
That was the hug that shouldnt be on youtube or if it is, it should be age restricted.... ._.
That’s what my mini goldendoddle does when I hav my mom and dad
"AM HUGGABLE" hehehe. What a cutie  great coat! 👍
Aw so cute 🤩
Tucker:hekk you dad
I like that that's awesome
Scribe to TTV face boys playing games
If that dog bites her leg it will become shorts by Linda.h (apple commercial)
Miss my boy 😊🐕❤
Beautiful
😆
Emotional terrorism
Tats good...hug.... If u had F*ck then....tat toooo dog will ask for 😂
You give that dog a hug    right now!
Why do get the feeling that when these two have sex it’s missionary only?
I'm huggable too says me
😘😘😘
Nice 😊 I love it
What a beautiful dog!  Blessings!  🙏Jesus Christ Saves Souls🙏 1st Corinthians Ch15 Verses1-4 KJV
Why did the man hug him. The dog gave no indication he was invited lol.
Beautiful excellent wonderful so cute 😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😀✌️
Hekk you dad
Cute video. But the added commentary for the dog is irritating.
Rip english.... I wants hug
❤️❤️❤️
Dogs are lovely animals; they are very sentimental; if a dog comes running at you when you come back from work or doing your shopping, and you hit him because you are upset, he might not go the gate to receive you anymore.
Nice video
Thé dog is trying to warned her of something 💔
What is your superpower?       I have a dog
Mine has FOMO. No hugs to be had in the family if he's not in it.
My dog barked and bit my dad🥺 he was trying to protect her
The guy trying to pat the dog when she finally hugged it! 😂 Not having ANY of that! Lol
Too cute!
Exactly why I don’t want a dog. 😝
U did a heckin’ disrespect, hooman
Tucker is  sooo cute
Me too!
I love his bowtie!
My bulldog use to do the same thing lol
I love that. He's so cute. My dog is the same
That's the kind of apartment you rent when you decide well 2 people can get absolutely gauged its ok.
Our dog does the same
Dang dog had his hair all fresh had a bow tie! This dog is like the Fabio of the dog world!
The intelligence of a golden retriever is equivalent to that of a 7-year-old child
Dogs are possessive.
Wtf? I think yall been doing more than huggin with that dog.
That bow tie is too stinking CUTE 😍
Ahh too cute ☺️
Used to have a dog that would bite in the a$$ any female that I hugged more than 3 seconds.  Hugs were allowed,  just dont get to over friendly
it's rare to find quality videos in YouTube shorts
What kind of camera did they use, this video is so clear and vivid?
So cute ☺️
😄😄😍😍
Also let us know how your dog react when you f**k
Hekk you dad 😂
Poor guy. Based on the attraction ratio, I bet my foot he hasn't had a blowy since the talking phase. Smh. Poor guy.
Cute 🥰
That's a typical golden retriever. We had one, his nick name was the love dog because he was always wanting hugs and affection. If there was an argument he would get in the middle and try and stop it. Goldens are wonderful dogs.
Hugging time hmm fronts are taken 🤔butt hugs it is
That dog is a cute dog 🐶  💖💖
This is anoce wholesome change of pace. I definitely want to try this someday.
My dog whines everytime my husband kisses me. It's hilarious! So my husband now kisses me then kisses the dog. Lol.
Are they mentally abusing there dog
This is so cute but also kinda sad Dogs and other animals don't show their affection like humans, meaning the dog saw him wrap his arms around her and thought she was being attacked. The dog is trying to get in between both of them which, I won't say cruel because it isn't but is adorable
In my house if two people hug the dogs jump up and join the hug
Our dog does that too
Weird question.... why do all these videos say "my husband", but none of them ever have wedding rings...?
He barks and gets upset.
Group hug!
Husband schmusband, I want a hug too !!!
Dude I promise you she loves her dog more then you.
I feel like this is even more endearing than all these tik toks of people with their kids because you are supposed to love your kids kids anyway. Its a given but THIS is UNCONDITIONAL love that shows that this couple are truly caring soulful and warm-hearted people.
Awwww my dog just barks at us then jumps on us and hugs😂
Exactly how my own dog reacts. He is just jealous lol
omg, dogs are heavenly creatures
aaaaaaaaaaaa he so cute
I would have done the same...................
The most I love on that dog is its english :-1
This reminds me of all three of the dogs I see the most.  My baby bro loves to hug my dad when he comes home from work (or me sometimes, but I don't come home as often and he doesn't find it as exciting) whereas my mom doesn't like him to hug so she sets her stuff down as fast as possible and sits down at the top of the stairs so he isn't left hanging. Loki usually won't try to join a two person hug, but he LOVES group hugs! I love to part the hug to let him job, but he hasn't asked in quite a long time.   The jealousy, on the other hand, looks like my boyfriend's two dogs. The tsundere one has gotten used to us hugging each other more than her, but I still think about one day very early in our relationship: we were two high schoolers who hadn't figured out first base yet, so instead we were snuggling and watching Last Week Tonight...while Cinna (the tsundere) stared daggers at us from the edge of the couch.  Oh yeah, and two days ago the loaf of bread kept trying to climb on the couch and the ottoman. Turns out we figured out she wanted ME, but couldn't get through my bf & his mom's legs on opposite sides of the ottoman. Oh yeah, and she forgot about walking in the 6-10 foot gap behind mom's chair.  oh god why I just wrote an essay on a dog video
Alright objective #1- find partner 😂
So adorable... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I guess any horizontal bedroom activities are a big *NO* too ^^
Dat ass
😡 it should be a felony to hug your spouse and not touch their ass. A felony.   But in the context of this video, it would be inappropriate. So dont drag me. 😇
Hekk u dad Omg I'm laughing so hard🤣🤣🤣
Dogs are very intellegent.
Anyone going to comment about beautiful that dog is.
Don't do that gib him hugs plz
tucker share
Dogs don't do this because they are jealous. They do this because in the dog world there is no such thing as hugs and kisses. They see this as aggression. So when they interrupt they are actually trying to defuse the situation.
When your girl cheats on you
Baby can you give me hug too😊🤗🤗🤗😊😊
“Hekk you dad” that got meh rlly hard T^T
Husband looks like a 15 year old. This literally looks like a kid hugging his mom.
Doggy doggy.
😂😂
Lol, you just gotta love Tucker, how can you not???  He definitely makes my day every single time!!!!
I love goldens my aunt had them when i was growing up their such sweet dogs and this one is soooo cute I’ve never seen a dog go in between the legs lol
love dogs, but dog talk subtitles are annoying
My dog reacts like that too
Wow, he's big!
My mum and dad dogs like this
Please do another one with that dog please, it's so cute.
oh my gosh this reminded me that my childhood pupper would *lose her mind barking* if people hugged near her, we couldn’t figure out if she was jealous of us or trying to protect us from each other
Not to be one of those people but they’re pretty much teaching that dog to jump up on people. Very cute pup though.
Trucker like umm hello human what about me mom and dad
This is so cute…  doggos want huggies too!
my dog does the same!
But if a guy acted like that you'd hate him
Too cute
My dog does that too
dog 's mind voice says : get another dog for meto hug like this.
Your husband looks like he couldn't save himself from a paper bag...
I think dogs do that bc they see hugging as fighting and they try to break it up cuz the love their owners and trying to protect them
Awwww, so cute 😍😍
So sweet!!!!!
A beautiful blonde like that who isn't gonna give a tight hug like that?
My dog does exactly the same. We can't do anything!!
My dog used to jump up when we hugged. We lost him in January but the pain just doesn't get any less.
You're so adorable dog
How cute!
My dog get jelly any time I give anyone else attention. Then when they leave she will come next to me and may in my lap. She super clingy and protective. She had a bad home growing up, my fiancé and I was able to buy her off the owner and she has never looked happier.  I love you hela
Those dogs are just lovable
Omg exactly what my little jackhuahua does he does a circus meerkat move when I hug my husband.... can't get a moment with him..... saying that I probably love my dog more like 101% more 😂 love this video!!!!! ❤❤❤
He thinks you guys are fighting so his trying to draw a wedge between you guys and break up the perceived confrontation.
That would be annoying. No dogs around me plz.
I've heard dogs dont understand what people are doing when they hug. They just see the arms going around each others body and in fact think you are fighting. They try to intervene so u stop "fighting" :)
😍👏👏👏
My mornings off to a good start
Awwwwww.............
Hekk you dad 😂👍🏼
😀👍✌😍
Quiere también.
🤣 Hek you dad!
What in the Air Bud
I really enjoy how people caption dog videos like dogs talk like they’re from Alabama, as if it’s “cute” to talk like an inbred dipshit.
Aw so cute
That dog knows something.
A clever way to keep the  👀 on the 🎂
so funny  your golden retriever
That is SO CUTE!!!!! 🥰
My girlfriends dog attacks her when I hug her, he likes me too much and thinks I need defending.
Oh I know what's on your back.....pppfffttt
Actually... Dogs think you're having an aggressive situation when you hug someone, so they try to separate you two.
Omg! This is exactly how it is in my house!!!.....Except🥴😆 it's me, my boyfriend and....My CAT! Her name is Sunshine. She LOVES to love. 😌
This is exactly what my kid does!!! 🤣🤣🤣
He said noooo. My bitch. Lol
♥️
First time truker saying hekk u dad
Awful jeans
What ruins these videos for me is the stupid captions trying to humanize the dog.  He's cute already you don't need that.
His floof is an entity by itself❤️💛
My dogs do the same thing 😂
Awww. Lol. Jealous. I want a hug too. 🤗
Dog DNT want to share his Wife with other 😂
😍👍❤️🥰😘😂😃😀😅🤣😄😘🥰😍
Why  do  you  like  Linda. ?
Beautiful coat
I am huggable.That's real.I see it in his eyes.
Test
AT LAST HE SAY HEKK YOU DAD HAHAHHAH
Aww haha this was too cute! He just wants all the love and hugs! My dog does the same thing! If I kiss my fiance on the couch or the bed my boxer will be there in a split second with her face right in between ours to get kisses too!🤣🤣 Dogs can be so needy sometimes lol but they are the absolute best and I wouldn't have it any other way! Love your dogs! They are so sweet! Your subtitles are the best too, they crack me up every time! Love you guys!! Love those jeans too! You rock the high waisted jeans!! I cannot!!🤣🤣❤
El perro quiere que ELLA lo abrace
The dog is trying to protect you
Oauuuu  que amor
So cute these are good humans
This is so cute ❤️❤️❤️
I love bowtie
😍😍🥰🥰
He wants from behind
اليسار الأمريكي الملحد American radical left 🤬
Tucker is a total mama's boi
😂
How can you ignore me?
I have 2 ,and they go crazy when I dance...they love it..J
My dog growing up would get in between my mom and dad and start carrying on when they would hug.
What happens when they're fucking?
How about being nice to your dog instead of exploiting it.
Have kids.... lol
Gracias por ser su angel 🙏🙏🙏
She does not seem like a dog person.
Step 1 : Find a partner
Tuck’a comments crack me up!! “Hekk u Dad!!” 🤣🤣🤣
What's up with the intentional mispelling of words coming from the dog?
don't let it see while making love.
She is a stay at home mom the  dogs job is to keep her safe he loved dad but not so shure this is allowed
Awe, he's do cute!!
Ours is smaller but she’s usually acting like that too.
Aye hold on let me go get my partner… oh fuck
Awwww too adorable
It’s getting really lame and cringeworthy seeing these sentences that the dogs are supposedly saying.
Pretty much exactly what my Nike does. Lol
Dogs are the cutest thing a person can have 😍😍
Tf are people still using this voice modded bot for, it's annoying af now
Mine growls and wants to bite my head off nobody can touch his mother!!!!
That's sweet!😊
HUG 'IM
So cute ❤
Aww that’s kinda my silver lab ever time I hug my mom are someone he jumps on us and barks lol!
The real question is...are they vaccinated! They are not social distancing and I for one am outraged!!!!...jkn
Super high level fitness right there. Gosh I love dogs
HEKK YOU DAD LINDA MINE
My Sami girl does exactly the same thing.
Hek off dad
Put it down
SAME AS ANY OF MY DOGS !!
Dogs need love too
Hug your partner  Me proceeds to hug my right hand
Another reason not to have a dog. Can't even get your squeeze on without these fools trying to sip all on your Kool aid
So many adorable moments in this lol. What a lucky,loved,beautiful pup! I miss my golden Boomer…he was my everything until senior year of high school. One minute he was fine, next he was in heaven from cancer…you were the best Boomer my bubbles 💔😭
🤣
Ellos son demandantes de afecto. Y más cuando saben que lo consiguen fácil.😍
“”What do you mean do I want one…. I gotta spell it out for you””???🤣😂🤷🏼‍♂️👍🏻☠️
My dog barks and barks as he wants hugs as well
Beautiful clip
Good 🐕😍
That's exactly what my daughter does too. 😂
He’s good but he’s faaaaat
I love those dogs
At last we found who is LINDA H.
Three some.
My doggo just starts jumping and barking 😂
Beautiful Golden!
No bigger affection scrounges than dogs and it’s awesome.
🤣🤣🤣
Yeh they get jealous too especially when a guy hugs a lady they know so well
That dog's coat is gorgeous 🔥
That is why they attack people abd and even owners. Dogs are not humans and stop treating them as such. Smh
My dog, a Shiba Inu,  cries and bites.  He cockblocks too. He will nonstop try to lick their face and then dig at their back until I kick him out. Then, he'll Shiba scream all. Night. Long. Fucking can't stand it
Daaaaaamn Linda is such a smoke show I’m coughing! Idk how her husband and Tucker haven’t died from smoke inhalation and/or severe burns from being so close to her smoking hotness! Lol 😍😂
Which bread is the dog 🐕
"Hek u dad" 😂😂😂 that killed me
Je la casse en 2...
Not for nothin with all do respect …. I wanna hug her too ! She is adorable, beautifull aaaannd sexy ! Your a lucky man there hubby ! Lol
That's Not funny He's tryin to Take Control over the Situation because He doesn't Trust you enough
The third wheel has all wheel drive
You ppl are just sick 🤮
Tooooo human!!!! Too cute
The dog’s coat is impeccable
Mom:- what is on my back Dog:- it was him though, looking around ,Lamao 😂
Me too  tucker!
<3!
My pitbulls do the same thing
😂😂😂😂 hug the dog 🐕 , than your husband.😂
Just a tad Jealous.
Ugh….  That ROBOT VOICE!!!   Ruins the video.
I didn't know Jennifer Aniston was married to that bird-leg pelc.
Oh my goodness, this is the most “golden retriever” thing I’ve ever seen :P With the possible exception of the spaghetti eating competition
Wat da dog doin
Doggie wants hugs too. So sweet.❤😍🥰
Are we all gonna act like her husband isn't wearing penny loafers?
All dogs do that. My dog barks at whoever is hugging me
Dog be like: Notice me senpai
How adorable!!! ❤️
Jealous puppy you spoiled your puppy
If you wouldn’t have given the doggo a hug, doggo would love a present in your shoe(s)
Tell me he is using that bad english on purpose...
Our dog growls and tries to bite my bf whenever he touches me. Funny thing is, the dog was his before we got together 🤣
💡That dog's trying to tell the man that this woman was hugging someone else like that when he wasn't at home😂👍
I don't get it, why does everyone assume dogs only speak baby talk?🤔
🌸💗 Awww my pup behaves the same. We so don’t deserve these beautiful animals of ours 🤩🥰
This is becoming quite annoying
She looks old enough to be his mom...
i wonder what he does when they copulate!
Well I think your dog needs some English classes😂😂
Her: HaHa, your dog rubbed his tail between my legs Him: Oh, I don’t have a dog😏 Her:😳👀🤤
😭 dog is So Adorable ☺️
I want one his puppies! Beautiful golden retriever!
Really sweet I miss my dog
What a beautiful dog
My dog's a Bull mastiff and he does the same thing except he just jumps on me
Dogs are such needie animals. Cats>dogs
Tucker "I'm your guy now " !
Persistence is the key to getting what you want... too!! NYC 🐾
Haha see it looks like the dog it helping the man went his not a home to makes the lady happy 😝😝🐕
Awww
I'd rather hug the dog 😅
That was cute even though I like cats more it still was very cute
Great vlog guys 👍👍enjoy watching animals who are loved
This is why I don't like a woman that has dogs
Family hug🤣
😁😂💖
"Jealousy is an ugly thing. And so is Dorothy in anything backless"... 😂
😍🐶
That maybe her partner but she's his mate 😂😂
My dog goes in between us the other way and just sticks her head through and stand there wagging her tail 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My dog is 10 times worse than that when I hug my wife
That may be because he wants to mount you?
“You want a hug?” “Nah, need $20, going out…” “I’ll just grab your wallet from your jeans.” “Ok, you can have a hug too.” “Ok, but now it’s $30…”
Sell the dog, it doesn't know his place.
This is so adorable! And I love his blue bow
Omg whyyyyy was I so sad like he got his hug but poor Tucker 😆🤣😔👏🏽
They actually do this to break up the fight.
What the dog doing?
Haha ours just joined the hug haha
What idiots this generation is. Low IQ right here. What tools. I feel bad for the dog.
Probably dog trying to tell the man that she is hugging tyroon before
Lol adorable
The last part made me happy
Low key cute😇
Im not really a dog lover due to a trauma when i was a kid but this is soo adorable
Beautiful dog!
Heck you dad…and husband reaction
It looks cute, but it’s also unhealthy. Dog believes that he’s equal to her husband, which should never be a case.
Subtitles for animals are so cringe
Well they say dogs are like their owners....so does that make her a jealous bitch? AYEEE
Yo said fuck you pops I want hugs from moms🤣🤣🤣
Linda is so pretty
Oh that dog is so adorable..🤗❤🐶
Very nice
Lol cute.
How could I not hug her
I want to hug her too.
Pervy doggi
LOVE UR VIDS TUCKER YOO are the one who inspired me to do this channel
I need a dog😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
❤️❤️❤️
Those jeans hug you nicely as well.
This is exactly what my chocolate lab does🤣
Awwwww sweet
Momma boy
I love it
So heartwarming. Dogs hold a unique spot for human kind that no other animal occupies.
@Nella Bucu
This is my dog up and down 😆😂
This is so adorable
Same here only he wants or insists I leave her alone. My dog is a pitbull male.
Another tik tok trophy wife video.   Yawn.
Retrievers are some of the most loving dogs 😊😊
White people.
Dog knows she's cheating.
I thought your husband sleeves was yours connected to your top. Because it looks really cute with the long sleeves.
Learn english
Haha mine instantly starts whinging and giving us her best "I've been abandoned" looks until she gets invited in.
Haha

Dogs are jealous as fuck
When I hug my friend or my mom my dog bite me on my arm but not like bite- bite like play bite👍🐶🐶
Hey I want a hug lol
So did you hug him or not?
This is literally our dog, if he sees us hugging he would go for a hug too.
Funny how affections dogs are ? Our dog does the same thing every time we hug or kiss on each other , she gets right in the middle and won’t let up until we include her as well , a female German Shepard , very smart dogs indeed like all dogs ????? Amazing just how smart they really are !!!!!
This is fwickin animal ubwuse
Dogs think we are fighting when we hug each other or kiss each other, so they try to “break up” the fight by doing this.   They just want the pack to be drama free :) LOL.
They smell the hormones....
Yep my dog does the same😆😁
The hekk u dad , had me rolling...
I know this comment is really random but please keep me In your prayers  My names Davee and I used to have 5 brain tumors. As of now I only have 2 left to go but this road to recovery hasn’t been easy.   In the past I had thoughts of suicide, lost my hearing, and I even have seizures sometimes. If you’re reading this I hope things get better for you and your family. One love and God bless ❤️
Loved this lol
He even sits. 😂 I sit for a hug
That 'hekk u dad' part at the end 😂
Tucker is so cute 😊💖
These challenges are so dumb. Animals will obviously feel left out.
I’d make the dog walk the plank if she was my wife!!!
Partner?
You just KNOW

Let’s cause confusion and distress to our dog and film it for fun....👍🏻 good for you!!
When the dog got his huggies I was internally screaming "YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!" (cuz its night time)
You are dating with a kid? ...
"Hekk you dad" I'm bout to start saying that lmaoo
Very cute. Also, his coat looks brilliant!
Aww he's a member of the family.
Get that dog a partner
Jealous 😊
Do me next
Ha ha ha. I love you Doggie!!!
I hate that ducking voice ppl use for videos
I will never trust a savage animal like that, pls get rid of it when you have a chils
You can tell that dog is poorly trained (if trained at all). That quick clip said more about who they are and thier relationship as a couple then most 1hr therapy sessions.
My little dogs barks up a storm and gets jealous when my husband kisses and hugs me to . I love how our pets love us.
Thanks they r not doing it , or else first ever experience of human dog baby
Damn he's a beautiful Golden! 😍 pretty lil bear 🐻

Give him some love too. He's family too.
Wow an attention seeking dog. Don’t see that much at all….
Wow my dog is different if I was hugging her he would have attacked me real shit lol
Omg cute dog 🤩🐕
Hekk u dad 😂
What about when you fawk !!?
This is prime manual, For Dogs: How to know if your owner is emotionally abusive and manipulative.  I pity the hubby too. He's eventually gonna get divorce cucked.
Jealousy dog
Hug your partner…..so they run a business?
Man is so skinny must be like hugging an ironing board 😁
Our dog used to hump the air when me and my wife cuddled 🙄😅😅
My dog does this every time my husband and I hug 😂 I’ve never seen another dog do it. I just thought mine was an attention whore 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣
I love this…..because it’s soo tru
So cute!!!!
❤️
Ours does the same, lol
My dog used to hump my boyfriend's leg whenever we would cuddle in the couch.
Awe❤️❤️❤️
Why is she going over??? HE'S THE TALLER ONE!!!
Mine does exactly the same with more barking.
“Hekk u dad” 😂😂 poor guy
You guys really need to have a baby
I’m so glad the doggy got his hugs in the end 🥺
Doggie said “Don’t forget to hug me, I’m one of the family members that loves you too 😄” my doggie always do the same and both like to be hugged and pampered 😄😄😄 they like us to rub their bellies too!
🥰🥰🥰
Ours is a rescue from a house filled with abuse everywhere. When I hug my wife she(the dog) pitches a royal fit. She must be having flashbacks and thinks I’m hurting her. When I stop… she’s calm.
One of ours goes nuts and thinks we are trying to hurt each other! 🤦🏻‍♀️😬🤣
I love how he is like hekk you dad
I have a Golden also..and he acts the same way when my wife and I hug... but also does  our daughter...lol
It’s not her partner, that is her husband.
Lol sooo cute and funny lol
Awww I was thinking like hug him already !!
Too cute 🙂
I love dogs.
That's why I'm still SINGLE!! My dog would bite her!!
😂😍🔥😂😂
In the beginning when my fiancée first moved in, he tried to bite him for getting to close to me.   In the end my dog didn’t care if I was there or not, he became a total daddy’s boy. It was friggin adorable.  Unfortunately, he passed away so it’s back to the and puppers but I think he misses his daddy as much as I do.
Soooo sweet!!!
Haha my dog defends and protects me unnecessarily and then if my friends or bf comes over he guards them from me and gets mad at me for interacting with him or them haha
Dog In Hebrew = KeLev  Split the word,  Ke= As/like.  Lev=Heart .  Dog in Arabic= Kalb.   Heart in Arabic = Ghalb.  Did you get it? 🤔😊
Such a beautiful baby
Dogs don't like hugs because they associate it with people leaving the house.
We want mom hug definitely what a cute puppy you have
Dog's annoying. Needy
You know what that dog wants.
So tender!
Such a handsome girl..💓
Ohhh Jealousss!!! Good Girl! Thats my Daddy Bitch! BTFU!
Give him a hug 🙏😭🤗
Too cute!
Dogs are so smart 🤓
1234
My dog would go crazy lol he so jealous when I hug my hubby.
"Hekk u dad" LOL
I don’t mind big dog they r so calm I hate chuwawa 😡😡 ruined my lucky night 🤦🏽‍♂️
If this dog ever has pups, I want one!
This is how pur golden retriever acts too lol she cannot handle anyone else doing hugs she needs ALL the hugs! Ahaha
My dog also got weird when I would hug my mom, either they don’t quite know what’s going on or they want in on the affection
❤❤❤
Ugh TikTok is so cringey.
Lucky dog....and Im not talkin bout the dog....lol
Honestly your dog doesn't give a shit about you he's just hungry feed him.
Figured that out a long time ago! If you haven't figured this one out already you're not hugging your partner enough
Wait,  is that dog wearing a bow tie?  That's cool!
No he dont want a hug hes being over protective of you cuz you as an owner are weak and lack authority
When me and my ex boyfriend had a dog together 😭 I remember he was giving me a hug and kiss goodbye and our pit wrapped his leash around our legs “nah this a group hug right here” it so cute when dogs get jealous 🤣🤣
That's so precious!  💙❤💚💜
Our dog barks when we hug and kiss 🤣🤣.
That guy must have alot of money to have a hot gf nice house and a cool dog
This is not funny it is abusive and mean!
Kick that dog outta there. It has no business there in the first place.
That's our dogs!
His so adorable 😎💖
Omg! I thought my boy was the only one lmao! ❤️❤️😂😂
“ Hekk u dad” 🤣 that got me
Nothing special here. My kids do that everytime.
Tucker: “Hekk you dad!”  Omg my favourite part😂
Beautiful loyal dog ❤️🔥
My Doberman likes to stick her snout up our butts.. especially when we hug. She’s quite a strange one
Didn't have to ignore the dog that long just for a pointless video. . . .
He had a bow tie and everything😔
My dog does that too he tries to jump into the hug
THE DOG IS SO CUTE AND A beautiful coats NICE AND shiny
What’s their Own partner
He was like i want hugs too! So cute
Fucking machine voice...
I couldn’t last that long! That doggo is so cute, I’d be caving after 10 seconds. Who am I kidding! 5? 😆
Whats with his bow tie haha really got em looking fancy for the vid haha
Dogs are empathetic.
wow.. you could do so much better.
I'd want a hug from her too😝
Its coat is so nice and shiny :)
Adorable!!🥰🥰🤩
My dog used to go through my legs haha
Luv ya Tucker😊❤
Haaaaaallooooo,don’t mind me…. Juhuuuuu!!🤣😂🤣😂🤣

Hi is so smart😀😺💓
I love a woman in a tucked in shirt it's just so much more professional looking instead of loose clothing.
What breed is your dog
Lucky dog
My dog does as well! He always jumps up
Thats sweet.
Tucker is a dad now
Actually, when humans hug dogs think we're fighting, because when they fight they do pretty much the same thing. So when he's trying to get their attention, walking between the legs and such, he is actually trying to make you stop fighting since your his packmembers.   But I shouldn't say this is the case with all dogs, some may be more used to human behavior and understand it better and thus maybe just want in on the hug. But for "dehumanised" dogs this is the case
Best video on youtube
If only i have a partner to hug to test this out....
My doggo does this
I wants hug too.
Did they... You know.... After hugging
Please stop using generic robot voice to sick of it
I want a hug from Linda too ffs.
"hekk u dad" LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
Me and my gf have a dog (smaller tho) and I can confirm that's 100% how it happens. Every. Single. Time. He even comes down from upstairs when he hears that we are hugging. Not sure how hugs can be heard but this little fella always knows when I hug his human mom! 😂
Beautiful Angels!
No partner. No dog.  Forever alone. ☻
Tuck you've been scammed
Aww I want a hug too ☺️☺️☺️☺️
2021 humans discover dogs
Lol yep well you should see what my Staffy does when me and the wife are doin it!!  It's amazing how they understand love and affection and also show a bit of jealousy and possessiveness... Or at least that's how mine reacts to me showing affection to girls LMAO
Dog knows a lot
“ooh look at me with my nice house and my nice relationship and my cute dog”
So freaking cute!
Im NOT going to Lie,..I first thought I saw 👀 “It’s Hammertime” on the plague behind them..🤣😂🤣😂 Only to discover by Zooming In it says “ Happiness is Homemade”..🙄😏
what  do you call a hug when its a Dog huggin a woman from behind??? “Doggy Style 🐶”  Tucker : okay Rufff! Ruff!  You Silly Human there you take her front Ruff, i will Doggy her from behind Ruff
💖💖💖💖
HILL AIR IOUS...
Ooo good boy👍👍👍🐕
She's doing nasty things with that dog
I don't think it's the dog that wants attention.
My golden retriever is preggers right now if anyone wants to watch her journey on my channel and the adorable pups ❤️😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes...❤ the bowtie...and beautifully groomed doggo! 👍🐕❤from me and my🐩🇦🇺
Lame🥱🥱🥱🥱
Dog be like: "so you haven't told him yet? That on random ass occasions when you are running around this apartment drunk as fuck, you let your boy smash"!
Aww the baby wants attention 🥺❤️
When my husband hugs me my dog freaks out and tries to get in between us lmao
Sounds like his nails need trimming. Cute video!!
Lmfao 🤣🤣🤣 your dog is jealous
her husband: When a little kid likes someone else more than you
Wish my wife hugged me so I could see my dog’s reaction 😅🙃
Imagine if that was an old boyfriend the hubby won't be smiling for long 😅
I love the dialogue...'I wantz hugs....Pweez'. You can actually imagine dogs saying these things. I had a nap tonight, fell asleep patting my doggy's head 💗🐾💗🌵
Gorgeous dog
My tern please
Her husband discussed by the 🐕
What a good boy!!!! 😍😍😍
Omg! I want that dog!! He's so beautiful😘  god bless🙏🏼🙏🏼
Can confirm toddlers act the same way 😅
A huge reason to not date dog moms right here. The dog was a placeholder before you arrived and is used to the affection you’re receiving being given to them. It’s a no for me.
:)
Anybody notice the husband was on alert though....he blinked every time the dog barked....he slick don’t quite accept the dog fully....he is just going along with it 🤷🏾‍♂️....body language is everything
“That’s my daddy” 🤨
Dogs are idiots
Those first few seconds of digital voice made me stab my eardrums with a fork.
Ha he's jealous, how cute😂
I watched it 10 times and laughed my head off!
Well finally tukers was given what he asked for..🤗
That dog is absolutely beautiful.
it's called sandwich or bukakke
Muito bom adorei
Lol my rotty does this, she will stand between our legs lol
A passionate Dog: “Heck your partner!" A passionate human being: “&#+#'&@+)÷¢™®€ your partner!"
Dam Tucker is a savage
Unemployeed fellow  here I'm watching  these🤦
I wouldn't want to share you with him either!
Beautiful Dog
if she has a golden haired baby...
Aww

Uh he sees homeboys hands are busy so he “dog shot her denim”. Thank you. Tip your waitress.
What a beautiful pup!!
Byudfol famali wont mmi end ddi tu
One of the rare TikTok vids that are worthy of clicking Like.
😍😍😍😍
Baby my love sooooo cute 😢😗😗
Cool family 😎
*Pup- "Hey guys, this is enough, your forgetting about me! I'm a very important part of you guys!"*
*My dog does the same thing! When I was with my ex, and he'd wine and try all he can to get between us! He does the same thing with my my son and I also, although he's 14 and for the past few years it's embarrassing to hug me lol :(!*
Omg love the tie 🎀🥰👍
The best
Classic Golden Retriever
Love Goldens !! For their intelligence and loving ways ! The best dogs ever !
I'd love to hug you
Lol love this
Jelus.
That is the second cutest dog in the world! (My dog obviously is the cutest)
Gorgeous pup!
Awwww ❤️❤️😍💖
Awwwwwwww hugs are the best 💕
Bow tie so cute😍😍😍😍😍😍
A well-rehearsed candid moment…
Dogs actually get anxious when people hug they see it as strange and sometimes perceive it as a hostile action so he was trying to break it up hahaha
Simps be jealous. It's like losing your house and half of your paycheck in a few years is a badge of honor for them
Watching this with my dog😊!
badly trained dog, passing it off as cute for tiktoks. cringe cringe cringe
cringe
"Heck you dad" in the end was amazing lol
My dog barks at us when we have any kind of physical contact that doesn't involve him 😂
My dog tries to hug but just fails
she becomes more animated when the dog jumps on her than when her partner hugs her. But dude gets to hug her longer
PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY: STOP...THAT...IDIOTIC...BABYTALK...FOR...DOGS!!!!
The end was cringe
me too    me too
❤️
Mine does same exact thing lol
ew that bow collar. imagine having that around your neck for like 17 years  also, reminder for anyone who needs to hear: theyre not your human child: they’re your pet: an animal you’ve decided you will take care of. allow them to be animals
That’s his sister!!!
Bellissimo e bellissima scena! Ma quanto ci vogliono bene i nostri amici pelosi.😁😍👋👋
So relatable
wtf same subs and same views what the fuck
0.36 Can i has? Is this a correct English
Try it with a great dain😂
why using “does”?
So cute
Sooo cute
Dog: How weird. They aren't yelling at each other
Adorable pets
And that is important?

What does he do when you cheat on him?
This was just so fuckin wholesome that my heartbreak healed from this
How cruelt 😩 just hug the dog 😭
Wait til you have kids….it gets even better
can I have a hug🙂
😁😆😅🤣
Me and my wife rescued a Chihuahua who the old owner was going to shoot with a shot gun. That was the dog from hell. She wouldn’t let us get our hands on her for over a year without trying to bite us. She wasn’t treated very nicely the 1st few years of her life. When she finally learned to trust us she loved to be with us all the time. If me and my wife gave each other a kiss she would try to lick us both at the same time. She knew that if she licked us on the lips she could get us both at once. It was funny but also nasty at the same time. When she died our other Chihuahua looked all over the place for her. She mourned for months. We tried getting her a new friend but she never took to another dog for a few years. She likes our Cain Corso though. A Corso and a Chihuahua laying on the couch together is a funny sight bc of the size difference.
C‘mon guys doggies want hugs to - cruel parents just kidding….  Cute video
This so darn CUTE 🥰 AND TOO FUNNY!!! Omg , def gnna try this tonite bc I wanna see wat my baby does but I kno she will most likely do the same thing cuz she is the same exact way!!!
Tucker Is Soooo Handsome!
Why don't you get into Halloween?
CRINGE!!!!!!
The absolute cutest! 😂 When he starts to get mad is too funny 😆 and “hekk you dad” at the end 🤣
That's because it was your ex-boyfriend's dog and it used to sleep in your bed and mistrusts bald caps
Poor dog just wants a hug
The paws of that dog is really big...🤩❤
Haha 🤣
Aww, poor dog lol
Retriever are not the smartest breed
Mine starts barking and jumping on us....🤣
When I was growing up our family dog did the same
El golden quiere taco!
I wanna Dog too🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲😭😭😭
Aw what a handsome golden retriever
Neutered, told when and where to eat, sleep, and crap. Of course he's going to care
He’s got so much personality and I love it 👍🏾😁
I hate dogs
Damn dude she's way outta your league
My kid does this as well….😂
I’m pretty sure the majority of dogs don’t actually like being hugged
Funny
Awwww!🤣🤣🤣 I Love❤️It🥰❤️ precious  Dog❤️🥰
Jesus is waiting for you to come to Him, He won't cast you away from Himself if you come to Him.  He calls us all to repentance, He knocks on the door of our hearts because he loves us and wants to save us. when you do believe and the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus and you'll get born again by His Holy Spirit and have His salvation, you will become a new creation. He is the savior of the world and he can save you, no sin is too great no mountain is too high, for he will come and save you when you call upon his holy name❤  Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.   2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
He is so darn cute.
The dog knows that her husband is at work right now.
What grooming tools do you use for your goldie!? I need to make my goldies fur look like that!
Jealous.
Please take OFF the scary red baseball cap. I get big anxiety attacks when I see those.
Hey! Let me give him a hug 😘😘😘
it’s called Sandwich!
🤣🤣🤣 dogs do this cuz they think were being aggressive to eachother. Especially when doingit.
Doggie 🤗
Yep......that's a Golden. Has to be part of the lovins🤣🤣🤣
❤️❤️
idk how many times i replayed🥺🥺🥺this is soooo adorable🥰 awwwwww
I had to say goodbye to Zeke last week, he would be 13 in November, we had been together since he was just 6 weeks old and I really really miss his hugs.  ———  Take as much as Fortune gives, remembering that it comes with no guarantee.

Lots of dogs do this. Nothing new.
Man going through these comments.. truly fucking hate how you can't appreciate someone in any way/compliment them without being called sus or a simp nowadays. You do realize that type of mentality/speaking reverts us back to when men felt they had to surpress their emotions more in fear of vulnerability etc/couldn't be sensitive or emotional, caring, & respectful to there partner, and women feeling like they can't feel and be themselves without all the glam and glitter/trophy wife type relationship shit etc, right?  Not trying to be dramatic, start an argument or anything like that but I mean  its true, & worse especially since its with the younger generatiosn the most.  And for anyone about to say ok boomer, I'm 26 😁 -Just aware enough to notice these things.  Last thing we need is to go back to that period of when men/woman caring for their man/woman respectively made you 'whipped'. Thought we were trying to move forward from all these societal standards, no?  I rarely ever comment but that shits been building. Young people have enough shit to deal with today, especially social media standards, they don't need to be made to feel like that on top of it.  Just, don't preach that you want that kind of change when/if you're also supporting it.  Ok, I'm done -no ones even gonna read this long ass thing at this point anyway, but idc about that -it just needed to be said --_-(·_·)-_
My pup trips out too, does same when me and wife hug, he gets aggressive if our son tries to hug one of us.
My little old lady doesn't like when anyone hugs me lol. She 19 with no teeth, but she will try her best to tell them off.
😍😍❤
Amazing ménage!!!...🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏
Aww He is so sweet.  Yes I guess the Husband too 😉lol
Hug the dog instead, and make the husband/wife jelly. Human's best friend ❤
Our husky always goes right in between us and looks up until you pet him
Dog's are the best💯❤❤❤‼️
I can't even hug my mother without my dog ramming straight into my shins with the rage of a thousand suns in a fit of jealousy
Humm I wonder why the dog is jealous 🤔. Lol
Lmfao
Our dog barks when I kiss my wife like he dont want me doing that
"hekk you dad" perfect father son relationship
"Hekk you, dad" lol
My wife’s pug gets jealous and so does my mutt we ignore them for about 10 Seconds until they look so betrayed we have no choice but include them.
When I hug my gf my dog Riley will get right between us as if to say "knock it off you guys"
my dog would jump and bite me
Oooowh so cute 🥺🥺🥺
Dude, become good chums with that retriever, they both would love you even more for it.
Cute
Can use that as excuse to hug my partner longer!
I want to hug a partner like that always wanted too
♥️♥️♥️
My son does'nt like it either.. only he gets hugs:)
What breed is he? Full blood goldey? My pup is a mutt but has the same horse like tail and I wanted to know where that came from 😂
Pets are "Guardians of Being."
Tall and skinny. Women really do like weak men
🤣🤣🥰😘🥰
When did Mom Jeans come back??
When dog started barking it had me worried the dog is possessive of the lady
The whole "animals talking in rudimentary language" trope never gets old for me, lol.
That’s the fakest hug I have ever seen
Can i have* not has
Typical.. 3’s the crowd, 2’s the company. SMH 😆
Quick way to ruin a video, LOLSpeak.
Y’all too cheap to be married
Next time when your dog barks...... Your husband is having an affair
He's beautiful!
Dog's looking for the fish tacos he smells
What does your dog when your husband gives you doggy 🤟🏼😬😂
Tucker was like: hekk you dad 🤣
Your husband is humble guy I can tell.

That dog is so sweet
By linda. H
Add alcohol
So when you gonna hug your partner?
My Bernedoodle Sherlock does the same thing going back and forth thru the legs when he’s greeting or wants attention. I thought it was a “working / herding dog thing “
And to think when I was a kid people told me animals have no feelings. Bull crap!
So sweet
Tf is this tiktok shit
That's my dog
The "heck you dad" got me good 🤣🤣🤣
Omg cutest thing ever. And that beautiful Golden 🤩🥰

We were all looking at the dog right? Lord have mercy baby's got her blue jeans on
My dog just looked at us and barked if we hugged too long
What a beautiful golden retriever. I’ve had three. They were all the greatest dogs.
Yep dogs are awesome
Stop teasing the dog.  One day he might just turn on you.  It's not funny.  Don't forget dogs are pack animals.   Set boundaries if that is even possible.  You have taught your dog that he/she is first, in your life.
Group hug 🤗
What breed of dog is that?
I only watched the video til the end to see how they hug the dog, too 😁😁😁
“Linda Hugs” “Hekk you dad” IM DEAD 🤣
Your (man) 🤔 knows his place in your dog's pack 👍.
Our Jack Russell went ballistic when my wife and I hugged up. Our Jack died recently after 17 years. I'm old and haven't replaced him. I don't know if age has anything to do with it but losing those around you is tougher.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Cute
Funny thing is the dog is more loyal than that female
Awww! Jelly bean 💚
What a beautiful Golden Retriever. His coat is in perfect condition.  Gorgeous 😍💖
ypu give them love quick you dont pay them for your dumbass vids oh lets see what my dog does walk in on your boyfriend cheating on u thats the vid you need wtf
I want hugs too😂😂😂😂don't forget about me
Hilarious and adorable video.  Reading some of the comments down here,  Putting your spouse first, the children second and the dog third makes for a happy and healthy home. Sometimes putting the kids and dogs first is important too. LOL.
The bow tie is too much.
Lol its funny how they act so human with jealousy when they love you so much and just wanna be with you
Disliked for teasing doggo for so long.
Luv these peeps!! They cuddle poochy on a reg! Too funny...
Id rather hug my dog than my husband and its not because I dont have a husband.
Awwwwwh I like how at the end he likes his mum more than dad lol 😂  He’s like u meanie  While I’m like sheeeeeesh
Lol
Interesting. How does he act when you're quarreling with each other. When my wife and daughter fought my daughter's cat got so upset she tried to break it up. It was so funny to watch she was like a little old lady getting all worked up over it.
Reminds me of the most heartbreaking pics I saw lately - young mother who totally ignored her little daughter, just preened in the lift mirror without a floor or word to the little girl who looked up at her.  Even leaving the little her hand didn't reach out for her child to hold.  Just walked up the path with her daughter following.  CCTV Sshowed their return, still with the little girl trailing along, and still no handholding, not a word or smile. Preened in the lift mirror again.  That night the young mother & her boyfriend beat her small  daughter to death. What a contrast to this couple & their dog.  Look up Nikola Priest to see   the difference.  Sentenced to 15 years in prison for manslaughter.
"Back off, dad. You almost stole my human from me." lol
Bruh that ribbon looks perfect on em👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
😂 so cute
Great I'll go try that... Oh wait i forgot, I'm gonna die alone 😆
Beautiful golden. The color and the feathers are wonderful.
My dog is just the same!
Hekk u dad😂
My mom would kiss my dad, and my dog would try to decide dad didn't need his nose. 💀 She's a little jealous ball of fur, now she just glares at my mom for daring to give attention to someone else.
They look like Sims when they hug
So cute 💝
Yeah my akita always jumps up to get in on the hugs lol
Ahh that's so cute, he's saying what about me I deserve some loves too!
He's actually trying to rescue you! Dogs don't understand hugs as a sign of affection, they just see you in a death grip and think "you'll never get out of without their help!" My German Shepherd does it too!
He as so mad 😂 it’s funny🤣💕💖
*I'm jealous too* 😤
Dats so heart warming can't resist to  😁 made my day
Awwww so cute! I wish my rabbits cared about me that way lol 😆 🙃 😂
This is what my dog does to
That dog is beyond adorable.
Heck you Dad... lol 😂
Just for "likes" and "followers" 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️😑...
My German Shepard goes a step further and pushes us away from each other. My wife’s pregnant and I think he knows and I can’t even put my hand on her belly without him throwing a fit!
"Heck you dad" Omg Tucker 😂
what does your husband do when you hug your dog ?  Perverts.
I'm dying. What a sweet baby
My doggie does the same thing to us 😑😂
I thought dogs see it as a argument or fight rather than hugging. To dogs it’s confusing I thought so they try to break it up to keep peace
Floof
ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE 💯
Goldens are the best 👍
😍😍😍
Finally a young YouTube couple that has stuff hanging on their walls.. why is it that most young YouTube couples have nothing on their walls? They broke or just like plain walls?
Every dog in the world does that....but it's great to see it on video 😣
☺️🥰😂
Oh my god such cheese 😅
It's cute but.. there's an explanation about it. When people get close to someone ex. Hugging, Kissing, it's a sign of affection, But Dogs, sees it as a sign of Conflict, what dogs see is there humans are fighting, so they trying to separate them, See how he barked at the end? That's dogs way of interfering a fight. This is why I love dogs. Dogs are so thoughtful. Like if you didn't know this.
My dog poops in the floor
Look at her, on her toes, hugging him! Lol! Nice mom-jeans! 😉 Beautiful dog, though. I love Goldens.
Tucker is such a beautiful dog gaaaally.
This dog and i are so similar🐷
WOW GOD LOVE HIM HE WANTS HUGS TOO DAD GUMIT
That bow tie is just too cute. :)
Gentle dhug lol
Gentle dhug lol
My dog goes right inbetween and jumps up to get a hug
ABRAZENLO ESTA HERMOSISIMO NIO VEN QUE QUIERE CARIÑO Y AMOOOR.BESOS A ESE GETON. LO AMOOOOOO 💋 😘 💋 MUCHOS. DIOS LO PROTEJA Y LO BENDIGA PARA SIEMPRE.
Don’t forget the pooch he wants love like humans with hugs then a good belly scratch.
Love it! He's a gorgeous doggo & should & knows love when he sees it!😁💖
My poor pup has panic attacks! lol
So... Cute!!!! OMG!!!
🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️
I love your captions, they are so funny!!!
Made me sad missing my pet doggie....😓😢😫
😂😂😂
That a golden retriever?
Awww...he's a gooo boiii❤🥺
I had a dog that growled and barked and became so angry every time my husband and I hugged. He was such a smart dog and knew that guy was wrong for me! Took my dogs advice and got rid of that jerk! 😆
Holy crap what a gorgeous dog!
When I was a kid and would hug my dad, my Shih-tzu, Teko, would bark his head off at us until we stopped. We began exaggerating the hugs to see what he would do and he started barking and jumping. I miss that little goofball!
The dog is so cute and looks soft. I would like to hug that dog at first 😍
Linda: “What’s that? What that on my back?” Tucker: Looking around to see what it was. When it’s him lol
When everything that’s been going on for the past four years, I have realized that I now have PTSD from red hats. 🤣
Hooooo que anjo. Que amor ❣️ parabéns! 👏👏👏👏👏😍
The way he says hekk u dad🤣
😆 my dog does the same.
My dog would do this exact same thing. 😂
Viewers: Aww, the dog is so precious  Dog: Let’s do a Thweesum
They are very possive
Hes like: give me hugs now!!!  Me:hahaha its so cute
Lol
Why does your husband where a hat in the house?
🤣 'heck u dad" 🤣
Tuckers like “if anyone deserves hugs around here it’s me” 😄
Niceee 😍
GIVE HIM A HUGGGGG!!!!!!!!
So cute
Tall doggy
Ahaahahahahahah.......so cute
I want a mommy hug too😉
🫂 👀 …me looking forward my nonexistent partner 🤪😂
😉😁😘😘😘😘😘😘😇
You just know.
The animal baby talk is the height of cringe.
Hi Linda i love you real hard and hard
I hope the dog has a partner. Often times these animal's feelings and the need to bond are not put into consideration; end up living their lives solo and dying lonely. If they are sad and have heart break because of loneliness WHO KNOWS? AND WHO CARES!?
Going through your legs! Haaaa Tucker is a HOOT!
😂😂😂🐕🥰🐕
that was the coldest hug ive ever witnessed 😄
Beautiful retriever! lNow, all U guys need is a sitcom!🤗so 🥰cute.
mine starts barking 😑😂
Awww he's adorable 🥰😍
Dude a straight derp daderp loser
Get a room
And then when u dance he will go crazy
Are we not going to mention that he is wearing a cut-off sleeve shirt with a black shirt underneath that has sleeves?
She S tier, him D tier lol
My dog barks when we hug
Your captions are stupid. The dog is trying to break up a "fight".
So cute!
I dig it...it was cute
That dog needs some  grooming tbh
I love your YouTube channel
Come hug and see how I react.
Why does the dog call him dad and her Linda???...
Sending you good energy for a long happy life together ❤😍❤😍❤
i cant wait to see Tuckers pups 🤩🥰🤗
hekk u dad. 😂😂😂😂😂
Yup, that's what my dog does too.
This dude’s wife’s bf had that bow tie on right before they filmed this.
The dog clearly only wants a hug from the lady. Away with the guy.
I want a hug too!
My dog always jumps on me when i hug lol
Bruh I need my wifu to be almost the same height as me bec hugging some shorter than you looks a little bit uncomfortable
This isn't a healthy relationship. Let dog be dogs. There should be no crossing of boundaries.
This proves Golden Retriever dogs loves everything. They are great companions, but not so much as guard dogs.
I don’t blame the dog!
Mom jeans and ugly jersey tank top... Kill the look.
"Hekkin Ripoff" You can tell he's Upset-
Lol the bow tie
"Hekk u dad"
U know which human the dog loves more lol
Dog doesn't even care about the bull
Who gives a crap?
*Couple hugs* Doggo: I don’t think so!
What the Dog is doing when they f***?
How can anyone go without hugging that dog for that long?
What style of pants is she wearing?
Cute reaction🤗🤗🤗💖💖💖💖
Wish i was the dog lol
Tucker looks so handsome with that bow tie. ❤️🙂
Hekk you dad lmao
That last bug off from Tucker says it all
I had 2 Goldens when I was growing up, and they were my everything... and Tucker boy, you literally make my day, and bring the biggest smile to my face🥰
Dogs actually dont want a hug when 2 people hug. Dogs dont have hugs in there language. So they think the 2 people are fighting. And what do you do when some one is fighting. You separate them. And that is what Tucker is doing.
❤️❤️❤️
Feel the love!
Too much floof😍
Happy family ever👏🏾👍🥰
"hekk you dad" 😂😂😂😂😂
Your DOG is so Tall😃😶🤤🥴
Dog: I know this is fake, but gotta perform for the camera..
Hug your partner should be changed to hug your husband or wife to encourage marriage in this adulteress generation.
Goddamn it's so long since I last watched tucker's video
For me my dog will be always number one.He is the best and we are best friends.
Dogs are very emotional.... If u lov ur children's they fill jelous
Cute
My Jack Russell who is more attached to my wife than me, even though he is my dog, bites me when I hug my wife.  He is a crazy little bastard😂
That’s why you never date a girl with a dog.
I have my own Tucker and safe to say he doesn’t act like this he just sleeps all day and  does walks every once and a while he is a cuddle machine and I love him a lot
I learned this is called Resource Guarding. I had talked to a dog trainer about our dog doing this when my husband & I hug. He jumps up on us with his claws going into my hips & it hurts! We have to act disinterested in his attempts to break up our hugs.
Hope they close the door while making out
You want a hug or right
Don’t worry, honey. We’re looking at it. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Heck you dad!!!😆😆😆
IT's NOT jealousy. It's dogs behavior when he thinks you are fighting.
Luv your baby's bow tie.  Very classy.
"Hekk you dad." 😂
Dogs be so needy!🤦‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂 Love it.😍❤❤
Hate you dad 😂🤣
OMG I FEEL SO BAD HE WAS BEING IGNORED😭🤥
My dog does nothing when you hug your partner but when you slap their ass he thinks its play time 😆
❤️ your Golden! Mine is 15 years old (Daisy). Best dogs ever!!!
Our dog goes beserk! And we definitely have to shut the bedroom door...
Your wife definitely loves that dog more than you
Our dog tries to get in the middle and bite me just so she can hug him 🤭
My pit-mix, Georgia, does something similar. Except she likes to go between myself and my husband. She ALWAYS has to be in the middle - on the couch, in bed...
This is how my husband‘s dog reacts to us hugging. 🤣
Damn, looking awesome you two, amazing duo, yeah, your husband cool too
My dog starts jumping and barking at us whenever my mom hugs my dad or any of us
The dog is kool...the husband is the one who looks out of place
I can't blame the dog one bit....
What dose he do when you make out lol😂
My dog does the same thing
So cute
FGS, HUG THAT BIG FLUFFY PUPPY!!!
A perfect family.
*Dogs are pretty darn good demanders*
Your dog are soo big and fluffy that looks as a lion kkkk
HUG THE FUCKIN DOG ALREADY
VERY COOL BOW TIE . LOOKS AS  THOUGH  TENURE @  AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTE   MAY BE ON THE CARDS.   CALEB. R.
So much floof
My cat gets jealous if my husband and I hug too! 🤣😍❤️
Damn, even with dogs dads get loved last 😂  The dog wasn’t even concerned with his “father.” 😪
Hehehehe
Awww cute
Someone doesn't know how to spell properly. 😆
I love you tuker and skaya
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂so cute!!
Cussing out hubby......With a bow tie on..😂😂😂😂now that's gangsta..😂😂😂
Cute
Aww poor puppy. I just wanna squeeze him :p
Lol my GSD gets SUPER jealous when I hug my husband. When we were dating, the first time she saw him hug me she flipped out. 😂🤣😂
Easy, partner doesn’t want a dog. Been arguing about it for 5 years lol
Disgusting
"Hekk u dad"  🤣🤣☠☠
Who else didn't come to see the dog? 😆😆😆
Please throw that voice in the trash and burn it
Oh my goodness 🙄 so adorable
Super sweet family!!
Sweet bow tie.. Is he available for weddings?
Many people mistake it for jealously, I’ve had dogs my entire life, trained them, going to competitions, dipped in legitimate breeding; it’s not out of jealousy he breaks you apart, he thinks you two are fighting, and as a valid member of the family he wants to split you up, as we split two dogs fighting, if they’ve stepped too far from play to fight. It’s a common behavior for dogs.
It’s like a child he wants to be included in the love!
So sweet 🥲 awwwwwwwwww 😭😍🥰♥️
He said, me too because you guys made the happy, yummy sounds. He’s a beautiful dog.
AAAAA SUCHAGOOODBOYAAAA
Beautiful family 🍻❤💯🇺🇲
Horrible computervoice!
Yea, dogs do get jealous though 😂😂
That is a gorgeous Golden. Smart too!
I also want a hug
How about learning grammar..  "I wants hug", "can I has" 🤔
Everyone gangsta until they be doing it and the dog wants it to
Tucker is the one that made me want a dog
❤️ @jesperbroberg ❤️.
❤️ @jesperbroberg ❤️.
Gud, 2 gud...
0:04 What the hell they are doing 👀👀👀😳😳😳
Dude is punching.
He has 2 dogs!!!!
This is nothing my pet never allows my wife near me.
NOICE👌👌👌👌👌👌
"hek u dad" 🤣🤣🤣
MY DOG DOES THE SAME SHIT TO ME & MY WIFE...IT'S THE FUNNIEST SHIT!!!🤣
The way tucker said " HEY . HUG ME "  SOUNDED SO REAL!!
If an animal is jealous on a human, the human treats it like a partner.
Hope you huged your dog right after shooting this video otherwise there will be no room for you in heaven...
It gets uncomfortable how the take so long till they finally accept de dog!   Everybody knows how dogs are inpatient and how they suffer with long awaits !
That bow tie is the cutest thing
Love this. 😍😍😍We just all want to be included and we bark when we aren't 😍
Is this your 1st time to have a dog. All dogs i seen act normally like that
I dont like golden retriewers or whatever its called
Tooooooooo cute 🥰
I'd want to hug Linda too!
Lol aww tucker jealous boy 💙🐾 to cute 😊
I love Tucker❤️
Hahahhaha🤣🤣
Very FUNNY
Awwww
Hekk u dad 😂😂😂😂
Dogs are totally like human babies.. Get envy when see their parents hug.. 🤗
It’s his bow tie for me 🥺💙
He wants a hug too....and you take good care of the dog he has a beautiful coat on him you brush him all the time and he love both of you beautiful 🐕dog 🙂🐾🐾🐾
Awww... poor baby.
So lovely 🤗🤗🤗
"Hek u dad"
😂😂😂 it is very funny moment
It was very jealous video
heckin ripoff XD
Please take the ridiculous bow tie off that dog. That's pretty close to animals abuse.
You only got a Like because Ticket got his hug.
Great 😊
Hahaha Tucker ♥️♥️😁
Awwwr, this feels almost cruel. I would hug all the hugs out of that puppy. What an absolute sweetheart. <3
Omg ive never seen skaya reply lol tucker be like: doin hugs YEet come to my little paw paw
Hekk you dad.. Lol
Doggy is not number two in the house, anymore. That weirdo with that red little riding hood on his head, has taken that place. Why?! Poor dog.
In this case I can totally relate to him... women with hot bodies aren't supposed to do pda
My dog is so jealous that he gets inbetween us and stops us hugging so we can both hug him lol
How if he see biologist  human need🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
That's an amazing coat
Has anyone noticed that tuckers ears flap when he barks? OwO
Literally anytime I hug my mom, the one really affectionate dog physically gets in between us and try’s to get in the hug.
At least he can touch da booty and not get slapped. The joy of being a dog…
of course you am huggable 🤗🤗🤗
Why the boyfriend looking nervous and jealous all at the same time? 😂
Tucker's the centre of attention. All hug approvals go through him first.  Linda should know that, eh Tucker, but, she' is, as we all know, kind of spacey, so, training does come hard to her.
Looks like Tuckers got a super power he doesn't want. Invisibility.
wonderful....beautiful. dog. So. much  love
Oh hekkin Tucker!
This is my brother. Literally literally my brother
Hekk you dad 😂
What species is that dog? I want it.
He’s got a wittle bow tie awwh
Dogs are always men's best friend ❤ ♥
*Awwwwwww🐶🐶🐶 Keep the Fun in All you do. 🐶🐶🐶* Sharon in SC
My Nana's dog is the Same way about me and her it's actually kinda cute 💖💖💖💖💖🖤
He’s like, “I’m wearing a bow tie, for crying out loud!”
Awwww da babyyyyy
The amount of sh*t that’s posted which is not educational just to score likes! 🤔
You two hug like siblings
I wish I had a dog like that
intentional attention seeker
Tuckers like "I gotta figure out how to get rid of this mf, I should eat Linda's shoes and blame it on him"
Lolllll "hekkin rip off"
Buongiorno un bacio al cane
He looks so handsome in his bowtie.
I’d want to hug her too! And of course, Tucker!!
Tucker Be like :No Linda , You are mine ,dad leave her alone 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Heh he only love Linda
I would have watched to see the great hugs! 🤗😁
No pues ahí se ve qué 2 redhotchilipeppers no pueden vivir en comuna con un solo bendito cachamocos he dicho.
So cute dog ❤️
Hayyyyyy elotitos🌽🌽ya me imagino si eya tiene un bebe🙄🤰
Awwww Tucker wants attention too
Awww XD
He just want some hugs..🤗🤗🤗
"Can i has hug?" i can help with your english
🥰🥰🥰
The poor husband having to pretend there is no dog for the sake of the dog who doesn’t understand what pretending is lol.
Just beautiful God bless
So the dog is dresses sharp just to expose his jealousy
You and your husband hug each other the dog came the dog think that was a tunnel so he went under😂
Linda is mighty brave for wearing black socks in Tucker’s house 😂😂🥴
My little shitzu looses her mind when ANYONE touch’s me!! And when it’s time for more personal time, we have to put her out of the room and close the door 😂😂my Husband wouldn’t have ankles left if we kept her in the room with us 😂🤣😂🤣or something else 😂🤣
That dog looks so expensive to maintain 😐
Tucker is so lovable.....and jealous.....but mostly lovable 💘
Tucker is too intelligent dog. He is not dog . He is simething else..
Why is that dirty dog in your living quarters? People are nasty as hell... 😳
Heck u dad 😂
My dog does the same thing 😍😂
Because they are pack animals.
By my count, he copped at least 2 feels 🤣
Classic with my dog 😅
That’s us ADORABLE
Our does the same thing. 😂😂😂😂
😑
Tucker is extremely adorable. So is Linda. 😆
Dogs do this because they think these 2 humans are having a confrontation. In animal world, when two animals come head on with each other, it means a fight.  Your dog will do this because he/she thinks I must intervene in between to stop them from fighting. It's not what most people here believe it is - jealousy.
Beautiful wife
Love it in every second 😍
I can't blame the dog one bit for wanting a hug from her.....woof...
So glad my dog doesn't care when I hug my husband
Keep the dog give me your girlfriend
Just like my German Shepherd!  Only he is jealous of my wife!!!
I didn't know they got married That's so sweet
Ok I'll say it.  What happens when he gets in the bedroom during... let's say private time of husband and wife.
Awwww
adorable baby ! He  needs attention too😊
We all know what the dog was after.  Cant really blame him.
Heck you dad 😂😂😂😂
You know Tucker’s serious when he uses “Excuse me” instead of “Esqueeze me”  Edit: How the hell did this get 1k likes???
I think he loves u very much Linda
Oh, and the “hekk you, dad” was on point.
Our Flat-coated/Labrador Retriever mix used to do this, too. He was just so lovable, and the most intelligent dog I’ve ever been around. RIP, my boy.
I like how tucker moves his head around and says ‘ hekk u dad” 😂 😂
Same with our dog
I wants hug too!!
We have hugs. Tucker: goes under legs like hug me to Linda
I dont know why this is so true whit Golden Retriever 😂
And I Am Just Loving The Way That Tucker Hates When Linda Is Giving Hugs 🫂 Too Each Other And Tucker Does Not Get Any Hugs From The Real Reaction Youtube Channel And Love ❤️ You More Tucker Budzyn
“am huggable” got me 😭😂
It's doing that becomes hugeing and kissing doesn't axzist in world that think that thay are fighting 👍👌😂
Ur tucker was tucker i am an tamilan from India in tamil nadu
Oh you huged him ;-;
Stop that your being rude sorry cute doggy
I’m pretty sure he is doing this because he sees your partner hugging you as a threat.
Tucker is so sweet 😍

Hekk You Dad Linda's Mine
Hekk u dad....Ultimate!!😂😂
my dog joins the hug too
hekk you dad 🤣
Many dogs get jealous if they think they or the adult woman is the pack leader they want to assert themselves as her mate to climb the pack hierarchy and feel threatened when another male shows love towards her they get jealous and bark angrily saying no she is mine. Only i get to hug her. When my parents used to hug or kiss my dog woud go CRAZY and run up barking angrily would even bite sometimes he would throw a jealous fit. Tucker was doing same here. Although trained not to bite he ran between legs and stuck head up near her privates and barked to assert she is his not the other guys. Either he thinks he is leader and thus is entitled to the female or he thinks she is the leader and wants her for himself so he can be above the other guy in pack and get her affection shown to him not other guy
Lol
So cute .
She said: nothing like it daddy me: WT-
He is so funny and cute
Literally, how the hell is Tucker that cuteee!!🐶🐶❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍

😇Please share the gospel before it's not too late. Be a good person. Always pray 🙏. Always be a positive vibes. I'm here to tell you the news that Jesus is coming soon so please spread his words. We don't know when he will be here. Or maybe he'll be here after you read this so please share the gospel or just comment “Amen🙏”. Remember he died to the cross for you so please share the gospel. And say this loud “ I'm sorry for all my mistake please forgive me . forgive me with my sins.l love you so much”. If you said that loud reply to me “Forgiven and Amen”.💕 And remember Jesus forgives.🙏

Ha, my 14 yr old  8 lb Yorkie wants me to pick him up when my wife and I hug so he can join in. I guess he likes Group hugs. So darn cute. Dogs are great.
Our dog too but jumps our legs every time we hug!
That’s  exactly how our golden acts! They always want attention! But it’s so cute!
So cute and funny👌👌. Great work🥰🥰. I am also animal lover. They are so cute. Thanks for sharing 🥳🥳 Subscribed 👍👍
So cute❤
Give Tucker a hug
Wow
This was way too cute 😭
Tucker is just GAWJUSS! How can you not fall in love with him on sight. They are beautiful dogs
I almost hate to bring it up but it does make you wonder what Tucker does when he walks in on you and your husband doing..... other things.....
LMAO! Cute baby Tucker 😂😜
Hekk u dad - Tucker
AWEEEEE hahahhahahag🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😂😃😂😂😂
Hey guys i am a huge fan of tucker so i got myself a golden too.. and he is 6 months now.. wonder what is the best vitamin or supplement to give him for his coat to be like tucker's
Tomorrow buying labradora We will be rich. Seriously this is a joke people need help because  pandemic while they watch a fake dog
It's all fake and people watching , a pretend dog and its Its owner
It is a joke that a woman pretends to talk to a dog 😂😂😂😂😂th is the way to make money
What does he do when you make love?
To be honest, I would like to see the opposite
My dog always does this😂
Defo a mommas boi 😍💯❤❣
Don't embarass him byaking it out in front of him otherwise who knows may be could get treated with with a dp
Which shampoo you guys are using pls tell 🙏🏻
Jealous at its peak
Thats really cute
My two Goldens do the same thing
I loved the end when it said "heck you dad" 😂😂😂
HEKK YOU DAD!
I love this!!! LOL
Lol the walking between the legs!! 🥰🥰😍 that's something the golden retrievers I had growing up would do and the goldendoodle my parents have now does it too (even though he's super tall and often can't fit without the person having to stand on their tippy toes lol). We call it the "Tillie hug" bc that was the name of our first dog who did it. It really does seem to be a dog equivalent of hugging, at least for larger dog breeds who can't jump into your lap/arms
I meant golden retriever sorry
Archer controvert to and its exact same thing get super jealous
He got mad when her husband tried grabbing her that's tuckers women lol
Of course, nature is helping us to learn more about love:)
That’s what my dog does
How old is he this year
That's funny and it's a beautiful dog
Tucker:OMG Linda hugs Also tucker:heck you dad
Seems like the dog will come first in this relationship I couldn't do it
He asking for a doggy session.
Que preciosidad, el perro también muy bonito
I had a dog 🐕 just like that. We were unwrapping birthday 🎂 🎁 presents and the dog did the same thing as the video until I wrapped a dog biscuit and gave it to the dog 🐶. It was so happy and satisfied after that.
God. Linda's voice is so damn annoying.🙄 u freaking over do it with the baby talk
My girlfriend's dog used to do this whenever we got intimate so I took it to a dogs home left it there and told girlfriend he had ran away problem was sorted then she got over him after a while
When tucker was born : hello mom  when tucker grows : hekk u
Papa Budzyn is the luckiest man in the world. I mean, he got Linda and Tucker in life. What else to ask? haha
Aww
AAAAAAAAAWWWWWW
Linda your dog is so cute!!!😍
plot twist: motherpluckers here for the girl and not the doggie...lmfao
Silly Tucker😂❤️
B u7'b
Mrs AVA is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy.
Damn
When I hug my mom, the dog growls and barks at us.
“hekk you dad” lmao 😂
The “hekk you dad” got me 😂🤣
My gf dog does this too but he doesnt jump because we learned her not to
Let’s just appreciate how GORGEOUS Linda is
In my native language (Serbian) we have an expression for a person who is very jealous. We say that the person is "jealous like a dog..." And it makes perfect sense :D
Heck u dad..ha ha
Awww so cute..
If he's doing that when you hug him , I'd hate to see what happens when you blow him .
B
my dog does the same
My dog barks whenever people hug at my house.
Awwwww 💘 📹!!!!!!!!
Aww
Jealousy is a disease and tucker has it lmao
Hek you dad 😂😂😂😂
Lol HECK YOU DAD
Tucker I went a hug to  Linda you want a hug too come good boy  Dad pet is son I mean Tucker  Tucker heck of
My mom and dad are on vacation and it ended so today my dogs Shelby and Gus are coming hime
What a spoiled behaviour.. sad
HEKK U DAD LOLLL
I always love Tucker videos because if you have a golden retriever (which I have for almost my entire life and still have one today), all of them have the same indicative mannerisms! My current golden Jagger ALWAYS has to jump in whenever anybody hugs, specifically me and my mom, we call it “group hug” when he joins in.
lo krlo baat iska b husband hai dil tod diya mera
awww
anyone know where to get the collars with the giant bows?
So can i buy you pupy after tucker and journee born a pupy
I love your dog i allready subscribe comment like a thousand time and share your video to 10000 people
So cute dog! What's the dog name?
*snort
Your husband has a dream life: gorgeous wife, gorgeous dog, gorgeous house.  Jealousy's up to 11 rn lol
Tucker: my Linda! Linda/Courtney: hugs her husband Mike Mike: *not anymore HEHEHEHEHEHEH*
The annoying bad grammar dog spelling needs to stop PLEASE
Tucker is as big as linda😂
Tucker :Hug me to 😶‍🌫️ Linda:Oh my baby 😘🥰
He wants hug when he sees them hugging..
How are the subtitles so on point?
Tucker just wants Courtney (Linda) to himself!:) When I visit my Daughter, my Golden Greta Lu bowls me over, too! In 2014 I had another Stroke, so my Daughter took Greta Lu in, and I would never take Greta Lu from her. For the past year and a half, I haven't seen Greta Lu, because of Covid19:( I hope that the VA will let us visit by August, 2021. Semper Fidelis
I laughed soo hard when tucker said "HEKK U DAD"
Awwwww tucker is soo cute😊
Hello folks. Actually, there could be more that is going on here, from an animal behaviour perspective. I had an Akita. 125 pounds. Drop dead handsome, built like a tank and smart as can be. My girlfriend would come up to me, just like we saw above, and love hug me. Samson, our Inu, would come up behind her, rise on his hind legs and lay his huge paws on her shoulders and apply some weight. I would be lying on the long couch, all stretched out. My GF would enter the  room and come lay on top of me, you know, to embrace and get things stirring. Samson would enter the room and stick his snout and big bear head between her body and mine. One my kids friend would come, many came over, and they would play their card games. I would get the snacks out. Nine years old lil Alex was sitting in the wingback chair with a bowl of Frito Lay chips. Samson went to sit right in front of him and waited. I was not ever in the habit to feed him that really tasty junk food. Not receiving any chips, he extended his right front leg and jabbed Lil Alex's in the thorax. The kids went "Whoa, did you see that" All of the above was sort of cute but it really was not. Samson had been castrated at eight months and by then was sixteen months old. He was exhibiting dominant behaviour.
you better take an husky
Give you dog a puppachino I wanna see how he  is
Arumai doli,dolar
Stop using your dog for money
"hekk u dad" I felt that
Heck you dad 😂😂😂
THAT'S  SO FREAKING ADORABLE
Lamo dog is cso cute
Ahahahah "hekk u dad" 😂😂
Well the way I see it, the dog acts like any other dog. It tries to go between your legs and then try to dig your lovely behind...any male dogs I know would do just the same. Your boyfriend is one lucky dog.
Ol
OmG SoOO CUTEeEEEeEeEEEE
Linda made it a point to show off her backside.. I’m not complaining..
Lol
Tucker needs a hair trim
My samoyed will jump up on you if you start hugging someone ;)
I love it when tucker said hey and he wasnt even looking at them😂
hands down one of the best videos on the internet 🤣👏
That is so cute when I hugged my teddy my dog did he same thingXD
Acts 3:19
Jealous of innocent..
Tucker : The day I lost my identity
Hugs to dogs..

You have an amazing dog. He’s wonderful, and really cute. Good for you.  👍🏿
Cute how jealous and spoiled he is
Cute
Is the poster illiterate?
Lucky dog.
I'm so glad you finally hugged that beautiful baby.  I know you love your hubby.  But that baby wanted a hug so bad.  He was saying Mama Mama love me.  So sweet  ❤️😘😍🤗😍❤️❤️
Haha I love ur channel! I’m trying to do a channel with my dog but somebody doesn’t like to sit still 🙄😅
Hekk u dad 😂

How  old is he he is almost your length
We have a golden retriever pup, he does the same thing when my wife and I hug to it’s the best (also a bit annoying😂)
A beautiful dog 🙌❤️🐕
Awwwww
VIDIM NEŠTO DRUGO
I want a hug too Lynda
When I was a little girl I had a dog who looked exactly like Tucker. He was the love of my life and my best friend and one day when we let him outside to potty someone stole him. I was crushed. I came across your videos last night and I melted. I never had another dog after Doobie was stolen (My Dog) I would only have cats. Well... I have decided next week I am going to go to the shelter and see if I can find one. Haven't been this excited in years... Thank You.
awwww!! <3 <3 <3 <3
Ciumento. Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!
The dog behaves like a jealous boyfriend. 🤣🤣
tucker the classic man he want all the attention xd
*haha*
Why do girls like jealous dogs and not jealous men?
Am invisible? *Not again*
Hhahah
*hekk u dad, the wamen hooman gibs more warmth*
Tucker has kids or not
just a question what that black thing around dogs mouths
You’re very pretty Courtney but Tucker is better looking of course
Please post some more videos we are waiting 🙏❤️❤️❤️
awww hes sooo cute when his mad
Yesh yesh i am not jealus diggyy hhow wof wof
Not funny.. Not cute...  This is a dog that doesn t know it s place. Potentialy dangerous behaviour..if it was other breed...and so poorely trained.  Dogs are decendants of wolves. There is hiararchy. It should know it s place in the family  Only clueless people will find this amusing
100% like my dog. He likes to be center of attention 24/7 and gets very jealous when someone else is given attention even for couple of seconds.
are you married
Ha, Tucker is the best❤️ Has to be the center of Linda's life‼️ He's  so cute❤️
Hekk u dad  Guys let’s sign a petition for hekk u dad
So cute
I’d so rub myself where the doggo did, woof
No one : Literally no one :  No living body :  Tucker :hekk u daddy   Expecting a ❤ from u tucker
When you saw two dogs but, one of them is the *classic Tucker* but you don't who is   Just hug your husband, and boom, Tucker will be jealousy 😏  You can see who is the *REAL CLASSIC TUCKER* by his jealousy 😏😏😏, ofcoarse give him a hug too 😏😏😏😏😏😏
Dog: Hey! I'm part of this family too, you know?!
You guys  Are sooo cute together
"Heck you dad" 😆😆😆
I’ve never seen Linda in person before. You are very pretty.
Tucker: hekkin u dad
My dog just died two days ago at age 11 so this really gets tears running down my face
linda's got major cakes though
Hello😃😀
My golden retriever acts the same way when I hug my parents or when I hug anyone lol
my dogs do the same thing
He's jelous but hey u haven't hugged ur husband
Have had Goldens for decades and I think this common behavior is more just reminding the humans that they (dogs) are part of the family team too, than it is a sign of jealousy. And of course Goldens are almost human in many respects anyway LOL.
That’s exactly like my dog 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ladki ka chakkar babu bhaiya ladki ka chakkar 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
What a lovely family :))
Nah nah linda, Tucker is attention
Well my puppy starts barking at me and jump lol
MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND YOUR FAMILY AND FULFILLS ALL YOUR WISHES AND DREAMS 😊 ❤️ 🙏
The dog is very julious🤣
Golden retriever ❤️
Dogs don't get jealous, dogs don't persevere hugging ans kissing as signs of affection, dogs recognize licking and pets with love. Really the dog thinks you guys are fighting and wants to break it up. This is true look it up
tucker always wants to be the centre of attetion classic tucker
So cutee Tucker..
My name is. KUSHI
Hi Tucker
He is one cute jealous boy.🥰🤣
Also, why have you stopped with What's for din? I used to make those recipes you know?
The innocence of this doggo, should warm up a little bit of everyone heart ❤️ Much Love
Hekk u dad - Linda mine! 🐕‍🦺
She built like mewtew
I love how he get jeoulos
He's just so damn flofffy
Tucker is too cute
Hekk u dad 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1 Thessalonians 5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.
What type of dog is Tucker?
The only kind of jealousy that's positive ❤
Hey cats I know it’s you giving those unlikes

My American Bully does the same way
Another reason not to get a pet.

Wow nice direction !
Lucky to hav such a beautiful loving doggie gr8 video. Such dogs make the family bonds stronger and it's like having a human amongst us !!
Tucker is so cute that you they owner and her boyfriend probably can’t have fun in bed cause tucker is like a child and you don’t want to screw around in bed around a child wouldn’t you?
Tuckeris not the only one, even i cannot hug my dad
Tucker and Linda inspired me to get a golden retriever and We did we named him “Bennett” he is 1 yr old thank you for inspiring me we love him so much and I have watched  all your videos since you started yt
Yup

Wish for doggy 😘
This is my Linda 😂😜😁
Bello!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We’ve been watching your videos for awhile and we’re wondering if we could send you a Aquabandit for Tucker’s ears  when he swims.
His IQ: 100qd
Nobody:  Literally nobody: Tucker: “hekk u dad”
I am done with this channel it's stopped posting on yt for a while and now it does tik tok
He Do Be Mad Do!!🤣🐶
i love that dog!
“I thought we discussed you all not including me when you do stuff & l said l wasn’t okay with it.”
Hello I need a hug too quit hogging all the attention I'm too handsome
I like how he was like heck u dad and liked Linda higging him. Its so cute 💞
it's always funny to me how white american boyfriends and husbands (the cisgender/heterosexual ones) always wear baseball caps. like, across the board, they all dress and look the same - jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap. Lol.
Aww, so adorable... 💓💓
So cute
So sad 😭     Then happy 🙂🥰😍
Tucker: am huggable?  Me: aww buddy I want to hug you so bad
Fun fact: my first name is Tucker as well 🔥💯

dog pill
Aww what a cute 🥰 dog, he want’s hugs & rubs too 💋
Nah, I think he likes dad better.  Linda's fury has been unleashed
Dang ol' Linda cheatin' on ya with another man, brother.   😛
When he was exited and said Linda hugs then pushed the dad and said heck u dad I was literally dying
The only downside to owning dogs is how short their lifespan is. There is nothing harder than having to say goodbye to your best friend 🥺
0:49 Dog was like get your hands off me
So cute but my puppy is cuter look at the pic she a classic
I think Linda put some thought into the jeans she wore for this video.

hekk u dad once again she’s mine 😈
I would love to meet Tucker. He's the coolest dude in Michigan.
😁💞 Tucker
I love his little bow and him in General
Are we not talking about that Jean and the beauty that has inside?
I was cracking up at the end
Tucker: I hate Linda >:(      But love her :}
I was laughing a lot because of Tucker's Cuteness 💗💗
The violent swiss additionally park because underclothes multivariably pass atop a defeated composition. flowery, calm men
Dogs don’t do that in their world so his not jealous
Let's get this to 1m views family!

słodziak
Who is Linda?
Linda enjoying a moment 😍 Tucker : "I MUST BE HUGGED OR I DO BIG TOOT ON YOUR PILLOW LINDA "😎😂😂

My aunt used to have a maltese poodle mix and she would jump up and bark any time I hugged her. It was hilarious. I was like this dog don’t like sharing my aunty with no one.

Somepawwwwwdy! What does a baby have to do to get some lovin’ around here?!😆😂🥰🐾
This is so cute! The fact that all he wants is a hug is adorable
My border has a whole repertoire.  Starts with nose under the armpit, then in the butt crack if it's exposed.  Lots of pokes and licks in all kinds of places.  The other day I was feeling sad trying to comfort my senior dog who doesn't have long and my border did several things that ended with him licking the back of my ears.  Needed the laugh and smile that brought.
Yup
I very love Tucker💕💕💕💕

Jealousy is the best Test for  True love ...integration is the  best solution ....
I am convinced dogs fully understand humans but just don’t have a way to communicate back.

Some one is jealous
My dog just jomps on me
Not interested in hugging a business partner. I will however hug my husband.
Totally relate.  Our dog Farley grew up w ma being around 24/7 and me away working. Don’t get me wrong he goes nuts when I get home but also gets mad when I leave. He will 99% of the time chose mom. And doesn’t like mom n dad together without Farley in between.
{Linda} {hugging his husband}  {Tucker} WHY WHY WHY GOD PLEASE I WANT A HUG PLEASE PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Can I join the hug party? :D
Tucker what about Journee?  She might like a hug😂Cute video😀😀
My grandma hug me and my brother and my dog came trying to come in he was barking too
This is the type of parents ALL doggos deserve.
I loved it when Tucker gets on Linda's back and looks around like..."yeah, I'm part of this hugging group!" 😊
Aw he's wearing a little bow-tie!
You guys are so cute together!!
What a good boy.
my dog is the same way and would start barking at my  parents
Such a mama's boy!
“Animals are my friends...and I don't eat my friends.”   ― George Bernard Shaw
