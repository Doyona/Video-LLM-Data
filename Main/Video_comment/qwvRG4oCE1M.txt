an emotional ending but an even more exciting future!
Off grid means that you will give birth off grid. But then you need a hospital? The worse thing for you and a baby is a hospital. I gave birth at home.
❤❤❤  ครอบครัวสุขสันต์
i believe most of your emotion about the birth, but i gave birth and to me it was no big deal except the pain and humiliation. i did not see my baby right after but i did not care at all. the more someone else had her the less i would have to and not be around all that bawling. drives me nuts.
covid hospitals were short of help. families of staff with covid, many more patients in hospital. employees working overtime lack of sleep and stressed because of covid. seeing deaths because of it. that is why they seemed like robots. they were numb and could only maintain to do their job.  you are lucky you got so much attention. you were not used to all the people and the enviorment. you were going through culture shock and these strange aliens were taking your baby in a cold place. wheiregreen. where is all the space. culture shock. caused p,,,where is all the green?

Truly informative! I needed a reference that highlighted basic wood frame construction methods & techniques where https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxYGamVaHfdHiPlAQaLa7zkwR02OKpGYDU were best. I am pleased with the depth and clarity of Ryan’s Shed Plans. It was really convenient to capture!
Thanks for your courage in  showing us your pregnant wife ! Amen God bless you three forever!

If only we could be free of oil and gas ?  Oil & Gas are as natural to the Earth as coal ..... she's just another climate activist !  The same people on her team would want her to abort her baby, ie population control .  ps she went from being a goddess to a bloated sow!
Siamo felici per voi di ❤ cuore veri happy.  Però imparate  a fidarvi anche degli altri. Mia mamma ha avuto 5 figli in Sardegna.  Tutti sani e belli 🎉
How to get a wife?
Как жаль что плохо понимая английский сам фермер
Hola soy Erika de chile felicitaciones  que experiencia de vida más linda familiar  linda family  hemos con mi esposo  aprendido mucho. De todo los. Trabajos que han  realizados .un abrazo grande  .chile. Ciudad de serena ahhh. Dan ganas de vivir ahí  .vay 👍👍👍👍👍🇨🇱
And there are a couple good books I mean there's probably a book that every single man should we eat and if you want to know what it is message me
You all were very cute and amazing couple and I'm happy for you and I hope you have more kids but just promise me one thing don't get so caught up in your memories don't get so caught up in these ideas that you have. You need to look at doing is how can I make the property better for my wife how can I make it more efficient for my wife what can I do that would make my wife more happy with how can I so what can I do how can I hunt better a loving man to her I don't know your wife and I don't know your woman and I don't know what her favorite things are only you do you figure out what's better for you what do you need to do is we the five love languages understand what her love desire is and then we'd personality Plus and then read The Love Dare you need to see if you can try to come up with a way to understand your woman your wife your child try not to get so much lost in your work around your property but remember that your wife is the most important thing and your child is being most important thing and you need to try to see if you can get your Bachelors in Social it's and master's degree in your wife because I guarantee you you don't have it you know you're wiping up not a expert of your wife
What I'm saying is that you need to one not get so far in your head you need to find something that you believe in if that's you know God then maybe you need to talk to God if that's you know your wife maybe you need to talk to your wife more and you maybe need to share some of the ideas that you have but don't get too don't get so far down the rabbit hole that your wife doesn't even understand what happened in the past needs to stay in the past you can't fix your future looking in backwards you to remember that your woman picked you even if everybody else thought you were crazy she's like I like him I think he's cute I want to get pregnant with him I want to tell down with them I want to move 39 miles away from everybody I have ever known my whole life and stuff with seems comfortable and you know home to me go stick myself out in the middle of the Wilderness where it can be hot one minute freezing the next minute and if I have an injury I can't take care of it by doctors I have to learn how to fix it myself most people would said you're crazy you're suicidal but the difference is yes it's more peaceful being out there away from everything yes it is scary sometimes it is better to have a partner who loves you and supports you and you need to remember to take time to thank God he has blessed you with not only amazing wife who understand you and does not think you're crazy even if he doesn't understand everything we were talking about she supports you she blessed you with a child she wanted to get financed you wanted to bless you with a child she wanted to move out in the middle of nowhere with you and she sees faith in you. So with that said you need to remind not only your you need to remember to not forget to treat your wife the way that you fell in love with her from the beginning get with a woman they marry her to get engaged with her to have a child over and then the ceilings are very very strong and then they go very very neutral they don't make it exciting anymore they don't make it a thrilling even if you hand when her notes or did something that she look like I don't know who try to sew something together for her or made something that was important for her and the baby doesn't have to be so big but even if you gave your woman a massage I said all I'm doing today is taking care of you and then after you feel better I'm going to go do what I need to do
I think is a man you need to realize that you can't go back into your path and you can't go down this rabbit hole fantasies that you think life is. The reason I say that is you have a woman our 4.9 billion women that she said yes I want to be part of your crazy life to love you I want to have kids with you I want to carry your baby clearly she's pregnant and I want to have a home birth to have it here at our house that we built with our own two hands so it takes a very strong woman to move 20,000 mi from anybody there's not a soul out there sides you too and then baby now with that said I would say you need to start researching a lot about how to give birth and help your woman with that so she's not stressing out second thing is you need to get out of your own head and take care of your woman need to learn how to hunt and so and clean and make sure that there are clothes and material and fur from your animals you hunted to keep you as a man warm to keep your woman warm and to keep your child warm cuz if it goes.  80° degrees Celsius to 35° below and that's a big difference and that's why you need to make sure is a man that you can support you and your woman. It's not easy but you've already had the heart issue go away she stayed with you she got pregnant with you and had your child she loves everything you do she is 100% supportive and love your crazy ideas most women who were not raised correctly or have a desire would say you're flat-out crazy there's no way in hell I'm moving 32. 70 miles away from people from people in the middle of nowhere with no Resources with us having to start from the grass the bottom of the dirt there's no woman he would advise you physical I want to do this with my man most women we gone hell no not for me
I think that you need to not get too far in your head and the reason I say that is it if you get too far in your head you will lose yourself or you will lose your spouse and the reason I say that is that if you get so caught up of it's about me and you are down this rabbit hole that you cannot explain and your woman's like I feel safe here we built this house together we did all this together you know your woman saying I don't mind having a baby out in the wilderness with you and you're sitting there is supposed to be the strong man the person that she looks up to you and go well I feel like it would be more safer going into town and all this stuff... I feel like that if you're sitting there doubting yourself a puts doubt in your woman's mind he's post be the protector and right now he's fighting demons in his own head how he posed to take care of me and the child that's what I think is going through her head.

Adding erotic photos of your wife to all your thumbnails is like selling your wife publicly to earn views.. You disrespect her and if she’s willingly do it she’s disgracing her self too.
I don't know how you could be in the cold, to me I'd be like stuff this I'm out.
❤️❤️❤️❤️😘💪
That seal was checking you out!!!!
انا من سؤريا اتمنا الكون حيااتن طيابا
LOL, he entered into a life of porn, these two are really not what they seem.🤔🤭
mm nicolle looking like a whole snack
WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING SO WEIRDLY JAKE? YOU'RE NOT A POET?
Wow...tempat ternyaman.
Okay,, It's Bugging me really it is? In order to get where you need to go you need to know where you start,,.  ARE you a traveler, Aberigney,   indigenous person,, if not your a new age traveler trying to get back with nature,, you can only do this living of mother nature not the innovations of today or tomorrow you must learn to truly live life remotely as possible to truly connect.   Flintstone, Animal bone natural fire  just like Tarzan when you live this way then you are on a journey,,,.  Not chainsaws, oil, gas, geeps, stoves speed boats  but truly connect as indigenous as possible spear hunting with a stick not underwater harpoon your sending out the wrong messages Jake your wanting to live off Grid then you must learn to live without your possessions  frig two property's you must be a millionaire,crazey to say it,, but to live a life indigoniusely you must be free of all possessions no money no access to privledges and then fight to survive when's the next Vidio of I want to live off grid use a canoe not a power boat walk run swim no pick up trucks, heat a camp fire food hunt bow and arrow self made using materials of past not present I could go on.   Life?  The reality is every human being on this planet needs to firstly no some home truths? 1 wether we like it or not we are aloan in life. 2 survival is key to surviving this cannot be taught we have to adapt. 3 we make our world what it is then we destroy what it is it's man's intaference with nature. 4 your route forward is key to the life skills you accomplish along that route, Sometimes we are successful more times we fail. 5 don't take mother nature for granted improvise nature's fundamental seasons prosper or perish. To find the path forward we must go back far back to where life began,,take what we know forward but keeping it green and natural. To be truly green you must live like a cave man and understand his, way's before applying your own. Then move forward and seek out the mistakes of relying on innovation but relying on nature to create that innovation of natural ability,,.  If we stopped relying on  inovation and tech,, how wounderful this would slow our planet reaching the pityful state it has reached today,,greed money power has destroyed Mankind and the earth now we can never go back,,.  A seed potato will give its bounty and continue to do so that same seed potato,. Still gives its bounty yet the cost out ways its productivity thus makes, planting that seed potato unrealistic what was, a penny yesterday is a pound tomorrow in order to recieve it's bounty we must respond and stop the greed of tomorrow that's why the world is, starving,, Greed.
I'm convinced our lives arnt our lives whilst we think they are? It's not our plan but nature's plan that takes us all on an unforseen  journey of past to present,,. What you inherited as a child will pass as your inheritance to fox,, it's unbelievable that we can force life nature this has to be nurtured,, your child will inherit your passion,, but bye right of nature he will have his own life maped,, his journey his aloan. Simply give to another whom will support your legacy untill it's time to return,,,your venture should be to support those intrested in your journey legacy,,. Give opertunity to some one whom you trust give them  chance of the journey your on and give life skills to those that will go on to support your legacy,, you have gifts Jake give those gifts to someone less fortunet I say there's hundreds thousands out there who will want to earn learn new life skills and give back to nature.  Good luck.

Really funny how this guy calls ti chi a martial art lol
I’ve been following your journey since episode.1 and find myself saving the episodes to come as they are becoming fewer and fewer.   Jake & Nicolle you are both so strong, so inspiring.   I’m only 5 minutes into this episode and Jake’s words are so touching.

Beautiful way to showing 💕
the click bait on these videos is real lmao
jake i love watching the positive videos you do BUT in this particular one you seem to be talking a helluva lot of complete random weirdness.chill out bro.it feels like you taking things wayyyy too seriously.
hello,,, wow,,the way living and living place so amazing am so proud seeing  and learning from both of you. thank's
The thirst trap photos though lol
Such a lovely honest way to live. And the ladies are so naturally beautiful.
My dear, what you are doing is the truth, and the pinnacle of morals. And the Lord bless you in progress, success and safety. Similar to this type of lifestyle, there was Aden before urbanization invaded the countryside and villages. May God protect you . Eng. Khaled / Yemen / Aden. Note: Of course, using simple tools and hard muscular effort
Did someone stay at Komorebi to take care of it while you're gone?
What happened to the cats!!!!
the best video enjoy it thanks a lot.
I for liked the existentialism
Do they have onlyfans account?
I love to live like that bcoz Im an empath.. I wish that Lord give me life like that..

나도 이렇게 사는게 꿈이엇는데ㅜㅜ
You guys are not only ideal couple, but have so much love and appreciation for each other, which sometimes goes missgin over the years. I wish i could do what you guys are doing, i definitly want o have a property up in the mountains. I have lived in BC but you guys showed a much more beautful and close to nature experience with you videos. Stay Blessed congratulations for the growing faily and many more to come hopefully :)
You may try millet rotis or wheat rotis imported  from India
Damn guys that ending made me sad....
Plz don’t cut much more tress 🙏🏻
Those thumbnails are just weird...
Machaalah ❤🇲🇦
Why do you want to leave your current property?
You guys are destroying nature
it is refreshing to see you live your purpose.GOD bless
❤
I don't know whether to call them smart or the opposite but these two know very well that by putting a semi-nude woman in the thumbnail of almost every video will make people watch the videos.
I’m glad to see Y’all eat something besides fruit or vegetables! While I love vegetables and fruit! I’m a meat eater!  I don’t know what it is y’all are supposed to eat or not eat!  I have bow hunted most of my life!  I love it!
confused. Veganathlete? But eating scallops? Hmm
Stop trying to be so Noble and Philosophical…and selfish. A baby, small child, and then a teen needs more than your “Garden of Eden” to thrive.
My friends
😘😘😘😘👍👍👍👍👍📷📹📽📻📼📺🎖
Beautiful place.. awesomeness..👍
I wish you both and your kids a happy long life melted me heart
that's just perfection itself, PERFECTNESS
This "off grid" lifestyle requires quite massive environmental footprint in the middle of an intensive ecosystem. The amount of down trees is quite substantial, the amount of imported plastic and chemicals as well and foraging for food takes away from the wildlife. I suspect this will grow into some kind of turist attraction which will increase the burden on the ecosystem.
Good luck Bro ✌️
Chainsaw, how nice. but not even close to the spirits there laughing. But understood you gotta find another "eden" where you can fell trees.
How do you earn money after living in forest
What happened to you first child??
I have only just found jake and nicolle, all i can think right now is: what happened to the two cats???? please somebody tell me!
where your cats?
Fake martial artist??? Wow!!! Haha
where`s the cats and dogs?
😍
Kinder is women milk, and not fabrik milk
Who else came here because the thumbnail showed her nips and dissapointed but after watching the whole video, then not so much? Good content people. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
With your extended outdoor adventure it was never your communion with nature that interested me. It was your communion with technology and the way you monetized it.  You are entertainers.  It was a strange channel to watch. There was nothing earth shattering about the builds other than you did it, and that is always commendable. It’s a hard life living in the woods. Add to that raising a child even harder.  I never bought into your commitment to nature. It all seemed like a motion you would go through knowing it was only temporary and for the money.  More apparent with the “just for you link” It was just an extended outdoor adventure. What is going to happen to all the stuff you left behind in the woods?  I know the general location is by the short glimpse of the surroundings. I wonder how many  other people know and how many visitors it will get?  A destination camp out ? Ha ha .
I can't believe I only discovered you this month. New subscriber here and you are my idols I have to admit

bless him he saying im trying not to cry he must of grown up in a house  hold where by ones  expresing their  emotions such as  crying was   falsy deemed as weakness which is utter  nonsense   its totally natural to cry  one should never subpress ones emotions    in any shape or form  it doesnt make you less of a man for doing so   this is the kind of world the archons want for humans one where by humans  dont  express but instead  subpress  a world without  touch no feel   they want us all living miserably

Screw a couple of tires the diameter of your cutting stump onto the stump and they will hold the fire wood in place as you cut it, saving your back from bending over so much to pick up the cut wood.
I never missed a video for almost forever- so the two of you simply “walked away”, always loved the dogs, bet the $ went with you, best to the three of you- I now also “move on”.

All those things you are afraid of are okay to daydream about but unlikely, it IS your home. But raising a baby with no moms and kids to make friends with or family to help out is too isolating so I'd venture to playgrounds and spaces and look for families who want to live in a cabin near you. I'd make 3 more cabins to invite families to. There was a time when I watched your videos years ago that I wished you'd let me and my son live there and give him the life he needed(child into teen): learning, a man around to befriend and be mentored by helping out, natural lands and less societal pollution, a new start, health and sustenance and growing. Reach. Very hard with new baby all consuming but people.... Crucial to kids and moms and maybe even introverted dad's who believe in community. Maybe offer as a Quaker Retreat space! Young adults (a midwife oriented crowd btw :)).
I was taken from my family and home as a child also
You’ve worked so hard on this property! I can relate, I moved and left my best 🪴. But the move was the best thing I have done. Found permaculture and rebuilding my garden and fruit trees is fun. Take care!
Info very nice..ur life story 😊
man for 2people. who preach positivity so much do a whole lot of negative complaining and for a man to be so weak and whine so much about this or that is so insane sure nothing wrong with a guy showing his emotions but I feel like he does it so much almost like a spoiled kid that don't get his or her way same goes for Nicole I think it's time they come out of there own world and see how life really is they been so confined for so long they have really lost there since of reality it's really sad and I feel sorry for them they would never be able to survive in the real world because they live in such a fantasy I wouldn't be scared to bet there channel is scripted seriously people it just seems like there acting out a part only they are terrible at it reminds me of 1 of those reality shows 🤣🤣🤣
What is thé title of thé soundtrack ?
Nooooo! Ditemi che l'acqua bolliva quando ha buttato le linguine! 😭
Nicole, the hand gesture did say it all. But I do believe the words you where looking for, are. "Chef's kiss!" Lol. Great video guys. Guys and gals. You know what I mean. I say guys as a plural for all people. Lol I degree. Can't wait to see the next video. I haven't watched your channel in a little while. However I watched the last 4 videos before this one. Including the one, that's around 4h:41min I skipped through parts but I wanted to watch it just to refresh my memory as far as what had happened before I stopped watching. Can't wait to see the new location. Awesome, that the last thing, just awesome!!
Please take care of each other 💕
The sparkly jellyfish is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen

I think this is really amazing but how does taxes and money come into play?
Such an inspiration! thank you to the both of you. I'm a father of two beautiful girls in bc <3
What is ther reason of leaving tho?
Yous prolly laugh at me but I'm a city boy been involved in the street life with gangs and what not. But I envy the relationship you 2 share with each other. And Jake your wife's a fox sure you know this very special type of woman and you show her off in the most  respectful ways. And jake is there anything you can't do I wanna see you play basketball.

I really wish there would have been some warning of what you are eating.  Did I miss something, quite possible.  I watch you guys because you were vegan so this was quite alarming to witness.
HHaaha she hated that meAl
可爱的蒙古包
We were born to live off of the land and live a healthy life for God's benefit to us. A new life comes your way and you decide to live in hell instead of heaven. I am befuddled by your bipartisan decision to do so. Good Luck and bye-bye.
people have been having kids in caves for millennia and raising them as wild as wild can get. you have more there then many people it will be a wonderful place to raise yor kids and dam right its going to be difficult at times but it makes it that much more rewarding.
Turns out you should have stayed But Murphy’s law...
Tropics! Love You Guys!
I just discovered this channel so logistics question.  How are you uploading the videos?  I know people who are off grid in my state are miles from internet and have zero cell service.
when are you guys due?
Your woodstove is incredible! What brand is it if you dont mind?
First of all, congrats on the growing family! Such an awesome and terrifyingly exciting time! Wishing you all the best.   I had a question - how do you finance this lifestyle? When my kids are grown, I am planning on shifting my life to an off grid homestead, however there are huge costs associated to maintaining it. (Tools, supplies, etc)   I was wondering what you both do for income to finance this lifestyle?
as with the seasons...you are experiencing the feelings of winter. I hope you find excactly what's meant for you <3
It is a hard transition to parenthood, especially when it was not in your plans. Could you invite someone to care take your property while you were away? It takes a village to raise a child and support is hugely beneficial. A homebirth for a first-time mother can be dangerous without support available. You will never give up on your dreams and you do not have to sacrifice them. Be Well!
Where is this at?
Please go back and raise your children there.  Our world is toxic and evil. Your home you built there is beautiful and peaceful. Make a promise to come back here
I watched the 4.5 hr series. I love what you have done with the property…..
PARADISE LOST? I saw it on the internet so it must be true. Gorgeous project, but the  gratuitous nudity became almost cringe. Any wonder you're being spammed by (can't say the P word)blue hyper links. Then they're left standing? I'm  no prude. I would run all over that site in a thong and uggs, but YouTube is a seriously dangerous platform.  Pimping your pregnant mate for views totally tarnished your philisophical legitimacy revealing your willingness to pander to the lowest mindset.   I'm guessing this behavior attracted a dangerous element and ran you off your Survivor Island project.
Ur pups are my absolute favorite ❤️♥️💋❤️ is there a video about them and why you have them and why that bread? I just find them fascinating 🐕
Storing wood can cause mold spores when burned can caused lung problems when breathing in. Natural gas is the cleanest because there are almost no particles to irritate the lungs. I have a Catalytic Converter Grid in my stove pipe and it gets extremely hot and it almost eliminates the emission from my stove and it does make your wood last longer..
If everyone gets off gas and oil, there will be no trees left because all of them will be cut down for cooking and heating.. Two hundred years ago, heating with wood was ok because the population was low and if everyone use wood now the air would be polluted from the emission from wood.
WHERE can we find the back story on Jake and Nicole? What does Jake mean when he says he was born and raised here, but that at age 12 he was taken from here to the desert to fend for himself with a new family? We want to know more!

I watch your video like so much
Hi Jake! I feel you on the introverted-ness and doing things, focusing on things and being balanced! Hope to one day find a wonderful woman (like you did) which will be my yang :)
After my exams, I am gonna binge-watch these videos. Such an inspiration! It is such a privilege to have a glimpse of your beautiful life!

You guys regrow the trees right? or do you not
I have just watch this whole video and have found every second enjoyable. I am in awe of h what you have been able to do. My biggest dream is to have a tiny house in the middle of a forest. However in the uk that is a hard and extremely difficult and expensive thing to do. Thank you for sharing your life with us all. I will continue to support your channel. X
This has devolved into a reality show on TV. You should’ve kept it original and real.

Stumbled across your videos - Just want to appreciate everything you do for each other
You don't have any stretch marks, must be using your stuff you made must really help.
I would so bad to leave the plants and trees I had nurtured. This must hurt so bad.
Off grid? Get a grip, city slickers. This is your header: "we camped in the woods, and, darnit, I cut my finger" Hehe!

These words. Wow!
Sites like his earn up to and more than 300K for these people. Where do you think they get the money for all their new toys? It comes from people watching, from Youtube, from people buying their merchandise, and from people giving them money. They are getting rich because of you.  Hat off to them for making a ton of money for no work. Wonder where their next trip will take them. You do realize this, don't you. lol
Where you get the money to do all this
WOWWW
wow this is so scripted
Besides the annoying self-righteousness, that is a a fortunate life you have. What was your secret to getting started? Inheritance, parents money, student loan, lottery, YouTube, working remotely? Seriously, what do we have to do to afford to live that life?
Noooooo dont leave!! jk ,. its smart to be near doctors for 1st year maybe 2nd. once the kids start walking they need to go out there! . but you can always go back and visit your garden!  youll need those breaks and so will your wife!
Be careful Nicole when I was pregnant my Mother told me "NEVER EAT SHELL FISH"......just be cautious   Blessings to both
I want to know why you were taken from there when you were younger.
Caro Jack. In Italy cuciniamo le "capesante" cosi:. Sempre SENZA CIPOLLA... Oglio extravergine e aglio... non abbrustolire l'aglio. Taglia le capesante a dadini cca 1cm. E cuoci piano. Aggiungi 1/ 2 bichere vino bianco , fuoco alto per eliminare l alcool.  Aggiungi prezzemolo.  È  PRONTO. Un grande abbraccio a voi. Buon appetito.  From Italy with love  Mai mettere CIPOLLA con pesce o frutti di mare. 😍😍😍😍
And I thought I could do anything...I was wrong. I learned so much from than just reading books. Thank you. And...congratulations!! Your child will be a survivor
Do you guys grow or dry mushrooms like lionsmane rieshi turkeytail cordyceps ect for medicinal purposes?
What I will say is kids come and change your priorities. It will be worth it. Your lifes work will now also be raising that beautiful child and then returning to teach him about being at 1 with the land
It totally a girl.  I have a pretty good track record for predicting and I am pretty sure you're having a girl.
Your wife is my dream  woman 💘
Is it just their equipment/thing to be super washed out bad lighting or am i doing something wrong ?.. btw liked and subscribed... so
From where do you get the money to purchase the things in order to live off the grid? Are you a carpenter by trade??
зачем девушку надул?
I'm pretty sure I'm on my way out cancer I'll never go to a doctor never not unless you or the next
And I bet all those meetings with all those doctors charge you a shitload of money too right
You guys this place is looking good keep on keeping on if you need any help I'd be happy to come help
OMG My I took her to the emergency room the hospital and they said yep her throats a little red looks like she's got a sore throat and sent her home with me I took her to our family doctor the next morning he did a throat swab and she had strep throat This
I say don't dwell on it anymore it was a horrible experience but now you have your baby I have tears in my eyes listening to you guys and what you had to go through but everything's okay now thank you so much for sharing
Those doctors had no right no f****** right I'm sorry Jake I know you're strong man you are well tempered I would have lost it
do you guys perhaps have abalone?
Are you planning on doing a water birth because I would highly suggest it... And then you could also bury the placenta in create a new growth of a tree on top of it the iron in the placenta really helps the growth. I don't know if shellfish is really a good idea to be eating while your pregnant but I don't know personally.
I`m late to the show...Great channel by the way....If you leave, you ain't coming back.....This is your dream Jake...Nicole I`m sure would rather live in a more modern wold...Unfortunately
See it as being nomadic. Spring summer autumn in nature, winter nearer to people
You can always always come back or allow others to you use the place for the meantime. Although it is hard as you may not be able to take it back.
Кизүй керемет мыкты👍🇰🇿🙋‍♂️
Imagine what jake could do In warmer location lol
Its a boy!!!!!
they off the grid grid grid grid grid
muh boi blu!
I'm a retired U.S Marine I want to live off the grid to society has gone nuts!
At my condo in Mexico, it's  all Canadians, all the time. Looks like you are joining your.countrymen  in the great exodus  south.
let me just say you are a click bait artist every single one of your videos that you see before you click on the vid you see your wife posing in a hot way what a genius i know that's everyone's intensions is to see her
Now Nicole need modem medical care and she have to move to city. Jack u can make video and post so that financial men have to do what they have started.
Stop the dramatic monologue, you know as well as your misses you will return. It’s not about you it’s about your misses and child grow up.
Don’t get to carried away mate with the monologue, no wind told you anything, your misses is having a child and you don’t trust the natural birth.
I’m not trying to be negative just trying to understand. At the beginning Nicole says we will be back. Towards the end it says bug out property I take to mean an escape property but they are keeping the Canada property. Ugh, I’m confused.
Beautiful , keeps a person buzy . God Bless
ME AND MY WIFE ADMIRE YOUR LIVING SO BEAUTIFUL HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO VISIT ONE DAY
Your son is a boy madam
A very spiritual couple ! Nice to hear yourself expressing your feelings in such a natural way .I understand how hard you worked for your dream and how worried you are feeling that without your care it wont be as beautiful as before .😊
hello
Excellent video
You should make a monument with your history of the beginning of your journey and Radom pictures through the years. Someday your place will be a part of history for your kids and theirs to show everyone how you started it.
Stumbled upon your page again. Still haven't strayed from the casual sideboob thumbnail or the yoga pant ass cheek imprints.  Nice.
Why is there a fat cow in the middle of the woods?
Beautiful
trying not to cry? Its okay to cry man, lot of blood sweat and work in that place.
Why does he has to go with her?...i dont get it...go give birth and come back...ill be here taking care of the house and garden...jesus christ...i swear these days womans are so demanding...i wouldnt go for sure...im doing enough..all the heavy stuff as a man....what more do u want...go give birth and leave me alone with motherly stuff...dont have time for that at all...
rich liberals  in expensive clothes  need people around them ,money and making party .....to much pro editing and cam settings
This women in all of the video she posing almost naked.. even when pregnant.. no shame at all.. if she don’t have brain so husband could tell her to dress up but he probably also not have shame just using her nakedness to promote the channel.. nasty
Great City♥️👍
Worried that she is eating shellfish while pregnant…..  don’t get weird about leaving until three months after baby born….don’t be sad..think about the baby….it’s about health and safety.    Don’t be self centred sir…..the garden will grow again….don’t be a sh………….it’s all about you man….NO!
i just found this channel last night and fell in love...then today i see this one...sad...i hope you guys go back
Great videos, came across by accident but was glued right to the very end, Better get making a crib, not much time left by the looks of things. Great work guys love it.
Soulful. Natural. Connected. Love y'all.🇯🇲❤
This man, I swear…what cloth was he cut from?! He can literally do anything!  What a blessing, so intelligent.
It took two.
안녕하세요 두분 다 멋진 전원 생활을 잘 보고 있어요  곧 아기도 태어나겠네요 축하 해요 🎉 💕
I thought pregnant woman  were not allowed to eat shell fish??
The sea lion footage was ACE!
How do you guys support yourself without working and buy all of those stuffs.
Interesting, he said she can cut a hole in stomach of wetsuit and her response was then I will freeze, rather than baby will freeze. She would be the one with wetsuit on and baby in stomach would be exposed and she didn't even acknowledge that she thought about herself freezing only and forget about her baby?🤔
Part of the reason for this lifestyle has to be to keep his wife sealed and kept away from others lol❤ just saying,  my wife is actually paranoid and the lifestyle would eliminate a lot of unnecessary  worrying and false accusations of hers for sure.
Love the channel, but funny little note: Cold and hot aren't opposites. Cold is just a description of the amount of heat. -40 C has heat.
Only a matter of time b4 he threw a baby up in ya
I have to say and I don't comment often but....lol... very cool ending.....lol..  .best wishes.....
I look forward to your next video in the new life that you have brought into this world I pray that all is well with you guys and to just let us know what is going on in your life I pray for good health for both of you and to continue with your progress and the pregnancy God be with you both please keep in touch
notable kukold
I love you’re  channel
Praying for healthy happy baby and to see y’all return. The child or children would be so much better off. Love y’all. Been following since the beginning. ❤️❤️from North Carolina.
I hope this doesn't come off like weird or anything, but there is nothing more beautiful than a pregnant woman. Father of 4 and both my 2 girls have 2 and the other 3 sons. No feeling as a husband or father like seeing GODS creation right before your eyes. Jake's protective instincts bring back such beautiful memories. Love to you guys and GOD bless your baby.
I LIKE YOURS SHOW .... I AM ADDICTED ... FROM DARJEELING
Amazing that u would find someone as unconventional as u r. Many of us can’t even find a conventional partner and there r million upon millions of us.  Will be interesting to see what is next. Best to u both.
Have Fortunate baby
Superb , Best Of Luck
Just balance your lives, take care your family, baby and yourself. You can go back this natural life style any time after your baby is born and be back here as your vacation homes sweet dream home 🏡
Have you had the baby yet  can we have an update do you know when you will be going back home
*Sad* but I knew  you were heading south.  does this mean you wont have at least one more video to tell us all  what the baby is ?    Maybe  I  missed that  part  but didn't  you guys have a friend that lived  on the property guy. thank you  both I have learned  so much  over the years thank  you  both James
Your wife will be about  to give birth of  boy！
How much will u charge me if i come & rent one of your houses? Hahaha
Haven't seen all your videos but stopped seeing the cats.. what happened to them?
Love your videos!
Did baby come yet
I love your content so much! Makes me wish could do what you guys are doing! I’m envious of you guys.
It wouldn't matter if you were gone for 2 months or 2 years.. as  soon as you laid eyes on your homestead after being away, you would be soooo happy to be back home. The longer you were gone the more you would appreciate how magnificent all the hard work you did really is! You 2 are part of that land just like that land is part of you!! I think it would be difficult to ever go back to a normal life. Soooo....have many babies and build your colony.  You are not the same persons you were 3 years ago so there is no going back, you can only go forward.  Godspeed to you both.
Why were you taken away?
Greetings from Talisay City, Cebu, Philippines.  Such a magnificent place! My wish for a safe normal delivery of Nicolle.  God bless you Jake and Nicolle!
Congratulations on the birth of your baby 😍
How do you guys deal with bears and other predators on your property? I never saw you carried a gun or something more effective than a spray or ..
The orcas look vicious I would be afraid to swim for a bit lol
Wow. Hello ma'am and sir jack.  God bless😊 frome🇸🇽
It seems that you guys never stick to the plan until the end, You always move on and leave the past...that's why i never subscribed to your channel!
Don't give up,  don't quit when things get tougher,  or in your case just different . just adapt to a new situation,  and your living patterns and routines , modern times make people solf and wondering what if.. It takes a strong character to keep the course and prepare for the  unknow ..
Seems like you're into the Chinese philosophy .. Myself prefer native philosophy,  be one with all things .. I found Chinese philosophy very interesting about 45 years ago.. it is an ancient culture.. but it's also very violent culture as kingdoms go.. the Journey For Peace more or less came from the monks as I recall they are substance living and begging for their existence.. the general population tolerates it but it's doesn't look all that great... in the 1970s the Kung Fu television show was first to introduce  this philosophy to the baby boomer generation.
I once lived on the boat for 10 years it's very peaceful life.

llevan armas de fuego para matar al oso que se pueda comer a su bebe ? vale la pena ese riesgo ,por hacer un reality ?'?
No es necesario ir a hachar , Arboles o sacar los , es su espacio , el hogar en un futuro de aves ardillas y muchas mas variedad de seres vivos ,  solo es egoismo humano ,cruel , solo para hacer videos y elevar  su  ego y  ganar fama y dinero. respeten la naturaleza que es vida en su estado natural  . no a la depredacion inecesaria.
So hilarious …I was literally thinking about Gordon Ramsey before you even said that..except he wouldn’t be to happy because they weren’t seared 😂
I just watched the 4 hours  video of    fast forward version of all episodes.  Amazing couple, their dedication , love, strength and working together is mind boggling..  Wish you best of luck , happiness and amazing time with your child. I’m curious who will take care of that place in their absence????. Wondering if they bought this piece of land or if this was Canadian government owned. If this was government land , were they allowed to cut forest and live there.. just wondering.. thanks
Remember you can't get the project done unless you get off your ass!! Great progress Keep On Keepin On!!🎋📽🍕
yes where are they really ?Last time it took me a very long time to find them using Google earth but I found them. This time no clues to help me find them again logic would tell me southern gulf islands ? What say you?That tree on the left of them is a clue. You botanist need to tell us where that tree grows.?
I have not kept up on you guys for a couple of months and what happens?  Totally exciting, hope for three very healthy and happy people.
All you say makes sense to me. It’s beautiful but you made the unreal real. The unreal will again be real for all is God involving.
Your wife is more important!
The question is if you live offline, how can you afford all these things and still earn nothing, all that space costs something, all that work costs much more than just free time. don't get me wrong I long for such a life but it is simply impossible to start something like that without anything, you pray for an honest answer I am from a poor country how to do something like that. I love you people all the best thank you in advance
I just found your channel last week. I hope you and your baby go back, just like the people that lived before more advanced times! You got this! Imagine having another soon and the children grow up together there…it will be BEAUTIFUL
Such posers!
The way the world is today, I would scoop up the baby and run back to your magical and safer home. Blessings♥️
seal: the hell stop starin at me  mate? also gordon ramsey wont send this back lol
Mantep hidup dialam bebas..takada beban
I guess now it time to stop click-baiting viewers with your wife half naked body.. etc
It’s a girl for sure,🥰
Beautiful you guys! Who does your editing?
Where is this place?
Wow, Youtube, suggested this channel to me, this shit is faker than Bear Grylls.
Just want to say as a someone who was not able to have children and then lost his wife to Covid, I promise you that the most important thing is your wife and child. When you stand on your land alone the garden and the homestead is meaningless when you have no one to share it with.
Ermizaa vida amigos buena suerte consu bebe eemanos los amo mmuxho
May I get the Cabin
What? You don’t need to leave tho
We wish you the best. Love is a Bird, frugality is normality.
Cc,je vous remercie pour votre partage...Vraiment bravo pour tous le travail que vous avez effectuer...Beaucoup de courage et d’endurance et beaucoup d’AMOUR.Que Dieu vous protege et vous facilite l’accouchement.Si c’est possible,sous titrer vos merveuilleuses video,en francais.Merci
Nothing to do but maintenance and fuck. No shit she's pregnant.
But why are you leaving?
I hope you have good luck soon in good health! And keep raising the kid in this wonderful place! I am sure he will grow up wonderful and appreciate the special life you have chosen to live
What a waste. Looking at all the dead stumps from the trees you cleared is disgusting. Why? Why did you cut so many just to build useless stuff for views and content? You can see there are logs everywhere just rotting. Your place used to be beautiful and now it just looks like a scar on the land. Gross. I hope you plan better at your new place.
Jake is ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING.  Never idle
Salut a vous félicitations à vous pour toutes les belles choses que vous faites
No life jackets on those dogs 😢
I thought it was yin and yang
How so cool
Hope to see you again after the baby is born..bless you both & the unborn baby...
Worried about a garden?? He said I'm afraid we'll go and have a healthy baby an not come back??  He should be praying for a healthy baby!! Ridiculous to worry about a garden when he's expecting a baby GOD'S GREATEST BLESSING!!  Why would they not come back? Stupid! I've always enjoyed watching Nichole but now I just don't much like him probably won't watch again especially if he's on
You know I here a lot of I's in your  comments .shouldn't  it be we . What we decide to do . You can allways come back to witch what we all hope happens . phase one is done now time for the next phases .
So precious…Nicole is so BEAUTIFUL and supports you so well Jake……. Seeing the baby kick that beautiful belly should send you skyward brother… Much Love to the three of You! Thank you for sharing! YOU are a True Pioneer brother as well as Nicole!
you will not be happy elsewhere you two made that place spectacular besides i just started watching you yesterday can't quit now .......my husband could do anything build anything grow anything you remind me of him he's been gone almost 10 years he would have enjoyed your show    thanks
So freaking cool y’all!  Seriously- what a ride your on!!  Enjoy!  Can’t wait to see how your baby grows in such a magical environment- self sufficiency at its finest 🥰
At least there is no neighbour you can cheat with .. ez game ez life

I will tell you one thing my dear smell is the last thing when you are pregnant oh God. Congratulations on the 2nd semester.
I would .love to see your story continue, the baby LOL
Seems like she would rather be a stripper. Notice how she’s mostly naked in all the titles? Put some clothes on
What happened to the cats ?
Blessings from Costa Rica!

Just found your videos two days ago.  I've been on a marathon with your journeys.  It does look like I have just watched the last one...  I REALLY do hope you'll continue to let us know how all 3 (by now ;o) of you are, what your families next quest will be...if you are able to share more with us, please do?  What an incredible couple! The courtship, the traveling, the engagement, the rainforest a captivating series of videos!  Thank you for sharing and I wish all three of you nothing but the best!!!
👍
I have come across other channels like this one. Mind you, I do understand your predicament due to the child that is soon to come and your feelings of worry for the newborn being 10hrs away from the nearest hospital and leaving behind your sweat and tears that both of you have built together... You said 10 hr. journey across the ocean, so I am assuming you have a boat, or not. If I was in your predicament which is really not the word I wanna use, I would start trying to locate and speak to someone who has a plane that could assist you and your wife, if needed... I don't know if there is still enough time to do that, but it doesn't hurt to try if there is still time.... There are many things you can do, if I was in your shoe, I would try locating the nearest pilot and work out something, If you had to be on the grid again for a month, two, even three months... 2nd though this would have been better if it was thought of months in advance and all is not lost regarding all the work you guys have done off-grid I would see if there are a group of people it could even be family, friend or people who would not mind staying off-grid for a short period of time and working the land, waiting your return... Family and friends would be best since there is already a bond there. You'll be surprised how many people like to work the land, it is not for everyone, but many do LoVe it, if given the opportunity to do so. Both of you have gotten this far, both your energies are as one that can only bring blessing not lack. The is no lack when working in balance it can only provide good fruit... P.L.A.F.  meaning  Plasma Love Always Flowing💙 God Bless...
When all the bad weather hit the N.W. I thought of you guys. Knew it would be a challenge. Also understand your feelings about your coming child. You built a life there with a lot of hard work. If you leave I think you will return.
Years ago I did what you did and never regretted it!! I built by hand a 1000 square foot log home in the CLEAR WATER mountains in Idaho. It took me four summers to cut and form up the floor joist, wall logs rafters, purlins and close everything in and then start work on the inside!! NO plywood, particle board or sheet rock was used anywhere!! Even the interior walls were log!! YES lots of work period!! But I spent 12 years in that home and loved every minute of pure solitude!! 20 miles from the nearest town 12 miles to the nearest paved road with elk, dear, bear, moose everywhere!! Sometimes even looking in the windows!! DEEP snows in the winter, at times up to 4 feet deep (had to shovel out the windows to see outside!! WHY did I move away?? Well that's another story I'd like to forget, but I did, now in my late seventy's I'm looking for another type of adventure in my sailboat, but that's also another story!! The trick is don't stop living and chase your dreams while you can!! DON'T be like the guy whose lying somewhere taking his last breath thinking "why didn't I......!!!! DO IT NOW WHILE YOU ARE ABLE!!!...The Lord God be with you!!!
I’m so lost on what’s happening but I hope someday we get to see the baby and you back at komorebi again living the amazing life you created. Prayers wherever you end up in life all of u.
You are having a boy 👦🏽🙏🏼❤️
This is my dream but... finances 😂😂

God Bless you
Why go now..I've just started my journey with you guys....😔 all the best 😁🥰💞x
Hello You have lived for the present and it is time to live for the future, the child encourages and at the same time requires it. That past experience is an integral part of your soul and gives you something that not everyone has, a fixed point to which you can return when needed.
Que lindos paisajes que tienen 😍😍😘🇦🇷
Where are you guys with things now.? Let’s us know, anxious to hear about the baby.
Y’all make me wanta cry, you will come back; you must take care of your family…
Cover your self I repeat cover your self

New dreams on the horizont.  Probably when I write this you're already a supper mami or very close .  Wishing you a great life with the new addition to the family . Be well xx
Thank you for showing us the stark beauty of the nature in this part of the world and what an inspired, brave and skillful man can achieve in it.
What I've seen a few times is people living off grid thinking that having a baby will just fit into the off-grid lifestyle. It can but it is much harder.
Jake & Nicole when you come back???????
You could come back to the old place, whenever u want a vacation. Am I right?? Btw, I just really  love your journey❤️
Beautiful. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

When forest wood
Don't destroy the forest. If you destroy 10 trees, you have to plant 50 new trees.
came a long ways from the beginning of cooking with a metal pot over a campfire.  Remembering when you travelled around the world
че за музон в конце
Hi guys i m eagerly waiting for see ur baby. God bless u and congratulations in advance for ur baby boy i hope so...
l enjoy watching this video, very entertainment,& the sweetness &  compatible of this couple.
It has been a while since I have watched one of your videos. I had to laugh at myself as the wood jake cuts to size looks like little books in the small cabin wood stove. I thought, why on earth would they burn books in the stove? As I continued to look closer I seen it is the way the wood looks due to cutting it so small. You guys are truly BEASTS in you own right as you ar living a dream many only see in their minds eye. I agree with Yusuf, I too have enjoyed all the videos I have seen. I have no idea why I was once subscribed and then I was not. I was wondering why I did not receive anymore notifications.   May the great Mystery always make sunrise in your hearts. Crying Wolf
Oh, I saw a paper-bark tree in the background, and actually the field with bamboo looked somewhat familiar... hmmm interesting!
Just seen the 4 hr release and subscribed. Maybe I haven't seen enough episodes but you should have a good credentialed volunteer midwife help out with the birth at home and free government helicopter ride on standbye just incase. Once in lifetime chance here.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I'm jealous I would love to have this kind of life with my family where everything is fresh, air, vegetables, fruits, seafood everything. Hope you guys keep that lifestyle forever.
MY  BEST  WISHES  FROM ELLAS...........WE BUILT  A BETTER WORLD ...........
So you just cut down all those trees and made a mess of the forest for no reason
You have hurts and disappointments from the past, those are the past. Have the faith and believe without doubting any of your current decisions to take time away to insure your child will be born healthy and no issues, as well as mother. In Spring return with  a healthy child and realize your tasks of catching up may be great but you have made a wise decision. Before you weren't to cry out stop, I want to stay nor  able to make any decisions because you were a child, now as a man you need to trust in your Wisdom, something tells you to go but for a season, trust  your karma and know the order in which you are doing something is the correct order. Life is often a series of "in order to accomplish you must do"...etc. This is all it is. At the same time your rebuilding your faith that YOU are in control and no one can take away your dreams not for your wife or your child. They deserve the same beautiful dream, beautiful life and the peace the land has given you to date. Listen to the forest, does it not encourage you to know "we will be here and awakening from our winters rest, awaiting your return but with a child for us to enjoy and observe". Trust in this time in your life and stop fearing the past.  All will be just fine, so go in peace, and all your surroundings and peace of your life there will be happy upon your return.
what did you put to make the cream?
Just a bit risque Nicole. You are quite beautiful but there's no need in displaying everything
Hi there. I was wondering if you guys could guide us to find a place in BC where we could live in a geodesic dome that we would build?
Please, BE VEGAN
как приятно видеть влюбленных людей!  молодцы показываете  как должно быть! а то у вас на западе там совсем с ума посходили с этими однополыми браками. вот настоящая любовь и трепет в глазах мужчины и женщины.greetings from Moscow)👍

I  have watched the 4hr episode and I can say i have enjoyed every second of it ,teaching us what life should supposed to look like, sharing your experience and gardening tips absolutely was magnificent, but you two have the courage to live out your dreams it really takes a lot of dedication and commitment !! So many of us live out our dreams through your videos, wish u good luck and hope u will come back what u have built through out the years. and thank you guys for everything...  obediently, from Somalia...  ♥♥
Рожать тоже будете дома?

You two have the courage to live out your dreams...!! So many of us live out our dreams through your videos. You guys are awesome ❤️
You guys can leave for the winter. Have the baby and come back. You can catch have someone take care of things there in the spring. Please don’t be sad. We wish you guys  and the baby all the best. Everything will be fine and you won’t lose this dream.
Es una hermosura vivir una experiencia asi como la suyas,en el bosque con el mar , rios, y una hermosa invernadero de plantas comestibles,....los felicito, esa vida tan hermosa que se crearon para  ser  felices,... me encantaria que su aidio salga en subtitulos en español debajo de las grabaciones !!!!
Of the grid with gas in the tank , electricity to charge the batteries, cars, boats, outboards, wetsuits. Gimme a break.
How you pay for all this
What a wonderful world.
DOnt Leave!!! you will never come back!!! dont listen to HER lol
I just love big bellies like yours  :  )
👍😘
It will still be there when you get back cover what you can you cal always re plant when you get back what you cant save it's a lovely home and will be there when you bring your new baby back
Off grid but on web, haha!
Killing trees the whole time! Haha!
How many channels we have with young people making videos about „living in the wilderness“ or travelling around the world in a van today…..?
You guys are awesome… Many Blessings
What do they do for money does he work somewhere
Cool intro!!!!!
I thought you were not supposed to eat shell fish when your pregnant.
Jake give yourselves a break. Fear not as the Bible said. Your having a baby a new additional life. Have the last trimester be all about your baby & wife delivered in a safe environment then come home & get back where you left of … God rested on the 7th day after creation was completed its is good, now to enjoy ! Before the fall of mankind … you’ve accomplished a lot, count your blessings, leave your future in the hands of Jesus !!! He knows  your concerns. Love one day at a time … Psalm 46:1 - He is our refuge & strength, he is a forever-present help in time of need !!! 🙌🏼😇👍🏼✨
I watched the 4 hr one and I enjoyed every minute of it. You two are a match in heaven
So much Love from INDIA ....No words , You are living a life , All i can say
I just found you guys yesterday. Watched a good bit of your compilation...Wow.  I (think) I hear your heart in this entro. Wow again the zen of you.  As a man, I (think) I (hear/share) your heart for all you e built, all that is yet to be, the baby an th fear/risk/unknown of have the baby 'here' or travel so far for safety sake and return to  'the impossible to know'... I do not know how I'd deal with it.  I think I hear you holding on too tight...How can you not? How could I not hold so tight. I default to the zen in your opening. You will know. Universe Will Chose to honor your most honorable intent. AHO brother.  (never have I so quickly felt so close to one so far away. I look forward to watching your creation open/unfold like the lotus. 🙏🙂
Good Luck to the three of you I'm a new subscriber you have a wonderful life  I'm trom Maine
i knew   they couldnt make it
Love the content but the thirst thumbnails gotta go
veri good👍
Sorry to say this but he's a narcissist.

Спасибо за красивое видео!!! https://youtu.be/40D9mq4ykds
Neal Youngs song...a dream, only a dream, a memory, fading away...
The fact that you never planned a permanent real house is all the evidence needed to show you never were grounded or put down the necessary roots for real long term plans.  This place was never baby or child friendly/safe.  You know it.  Everyone knows it.
So I think I missed something.. are they leaving the woods and going back to the city.. home.. or just taking some time off while baby is born?
Usually Nicole is within ten feet of him. He was speaking to her and got no response.. what's up? It's not the baby. Something happened your not talking about. Nicole is not herself at all. I haven't seen you two in awhile but things have definitely changed. Best of luck
A pregnant woman is such a beautiful sight ... thank you for sharing. Now we await the child ...
😍👍😍Awesome
Dear jake and nicolle, I wish you very good health and have a comfortable time with new baby,  God bless you all,
Oh man. This would have been an wonderful opportunity for a house swap. We live on the island and dream of a place like yours.
Wow the baby is just wow
You are the best content channel of THEM ALL. Don't leave us, and don't be alone without your Youtube family.
Seriously Jake?  Leaving for a few months is like losing an arm?  Scared you'll lose your dream because you have to make sure Nicole and your newly born child are safely delivered?    Dude, you need to get a grip on what's important!
All that work on the nursery hut... I see you all coming back and enjoying all of the realities you've created...
To the two beautiful people that started their lives together living in every moment together,   Don’t stop now. Don’t let what you are going through make you fearful enough to stop. I am 52 now, the only way to get through this life is to live in every moment while we are on the paths we are on; and look at you... you are on a path that dreams are made of. The biggest gift you could give your unborn child, especially now, is to know that dream for them self. Pray, have trust that you can have a healthy, happy baby in the bosom of creation. If anyone could have better odds, it is the two of you. You are both young, strong, both very healthy. Plan for Dad to give birth and guess what? The possibilities for the most beautiful moment in your lives are so great, that it will emerge.  All the BEST to the both of you... and baby. ❤️
Leaving your home and moving to another country just weeks before the birth of your child has got to be the stupidest thing I've heard of.  What are you thinking?
Your guys story is awesome and incredible love the video photography work thx
I would probably use both locations Komorebi in Spring/Summer and the new tropical location during Fall/Winter. Hopefully the tropical location is not that isolated. Hope, everything goes well with you! 🙏😊🌲🦞🏊‍♂️🌸☀️🌴 🏖  👩🏻‍🤝‍👨🏼👶 🍼
Any updates
Congratulations on the baby!!!
If your heart says to come back, make it so.
Hi. Missing your videos. Is this the end ? You won't be returning back and uploading videos? Kem (South Africa)
Nicole, sending you prayers for a healthy delivery.
Where have you guys gone. You got me addicted and now I can’t even find out anything about your baby. Miss seeing new episodes
Is this a soft-porn channel?  *Every* video on this channel has a half-clothed woman on the main video image. I'm sure it drives a lot of hits. Won't be getting any views from me. Good luck with the channel.
Having a baby is one of the most natural things in the world.  It is not a medical condition.  Many women are woefully out of shape,  their abdominal muscles are so weak and/or they are fat.  That is such an issue that Obstetricians are just doing C-sections because it is safer than allowing  some unhealthy woman,  incapable of safely delivering her own child,  do it.  Nicolle does not appear weak and unhealthy,  she is certainly eating great and is not sedentary  -  so she will be fine.
God bless you both I watched your videos from the start around 3 years ago very happy for both of you the progress you made. I know its not easy I have done that life fo3 years in the woods of Scotland 20 years ago I used to hunt and eat but you having to grow everything it's a accomplishment. now you have new member of family will be coming soon you two remind us of Adam and ev when they start humanity let not forget that. God bless.
Haven't heard or seen much from you guys. Hope everything is ok We're all thinking about you ❤️
I'd like to know are you guys coming back on I miss you guys
hi there,didn't know where i can send u message, but as  a fan of you from far side of the world, i am wondering what's happened 2your pregnancy guys, pls let us know, i hope all of you being healthy and happy ♥🌹🌻🙏
So will is J&N no longer be on YouTube?  I enjoyed checking in and getting new idea!
IS shell vegan???
what is the song at the start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfbGJ89Lkfk                   you guys should build one of these its a stove over etc all wood fired
why are you ruining those trees man?
Well Jake, what’s next? I can’t imagine you abandoning this little bit of heaven you and Nicole have carved out of the Vancouver Island wilderness. Please let us all know what chapter twos adventure will be. Are you staying with Nicole’s family until the baby is born, then back to the homestead? We are all anxious to see all those fruit trees produce delicious and nutritious bounty! Stay well stay safe, God bless.
If someone is living off the grid and is overweight, are they eating too much from the land?
Missing you guys! Hope all is well ❤
Haven't seen you two for a few weeks I hope everything is okay love you guys praying for you
looking forward to you going back. you have been part of our lives as well.
To Jake ,Nicole and your soon to be . I love ,respect and appreciate . Been here since before the van and pop up garage. Best wishes.
Did I miss something did they move till baby comes or did they move for good
Hoping you are and wishing you well!
Long time no hear.  Hope that all is well.  I'm guessing that you are getting married and on a honeymoon vacation before the baby.  Hope to hear from you soon.
Afraid to loose a garden vs possibly wife & child?  What’s to consider?
Pimping your gf for views is disgusting.
New subscriber
Marvellous
SALUDOS DESDE MENDOZA, ARGENTINA
Hi Nicolle and Jake  Hope everything is going well for you both... Just thinking of you and looking forward to your next video... I miss you 😭😭😭🥰❤️❤️❤️
Pretty sure you'll be back there in record time once you see how insane people on the mainland have become.  Welcome to Wonderland.
Love watching this pretty couple make love. Thanks guys!
It's a boy
You built a nursery house and you're leaving it this is sad I don't want you to but you two will do as you need happy for you Nicole
If I could come up and come out of this country which they won't let me do I'd go up and take care of it for you too so happy for you both boy or girl that way it would still be there when you get back
We are all worried something is wrong please let us know
Hello where did you guys go
Hay when are you going to post another episode.  Did you guys quit.  We really like you guys. Now we are getting worried something has gone wrong  is everything alright please let us all know your alright
Never mind ' I saw him.
Hey Jake, I've been away for a while.  I'm missing one dog.  Where is it?
Dude has literally pimped his wife out for years...and people act like this is the model experience
Hello dear I am from India 🇮🇳..?🤗incredible this is a good place with wood house 🏡 and stay for that you and you are wife is and coming a soon little baby 🍼🤗😊😊god job..?
It looks like a boy
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D❤️❤️❤️
Is this it? Are you going to post anymore videos? Do we get to see the baby? I just love you both so much and to just end this is so sad. It is supposed to be a new and happy beginning.
I am soooo jealous, y’all have the knowledge and skill to really make this lifestyle work and I think it’s absolutely incredible!!!!
Hello
Sounds to me like he wants to send her to the baby while he stays home.  Why wouldn’t he go back?  What would stop them from going back?  It makes no sense.
WOW, you guys are amazing!  Been watching you for over a year now and I can almost feel the pain and the fear coming along with your decision to move along, but at the same time I feel excited for you both.  Thanks  so much for enriching my life and giving me hopes of my own.  Since starting watching your channel I have engaged in an off grid experience of my own for 10 months now,  and as each day passes I realize how much stronger I have become.  I too am getting ready to share my journey with the world.  Thanks so much for the inspiration!  Many blessings to you both and BEST of luck on your new adventure!  You KNOW it will be GREAT!!!
thank you !
Man, what you have shared these past years, from the building of your little paradise to showing us all of the beauty of that area, sealife, wildlife, and just the pure raw nature, is absolutely incredible. I am sure, myself as well as many others, would love to have the opportunity to live a life such as yours. I believe there is def a privacy that is needed for your sanity but to be able to see, from the best youtube channel there is, what your life is like is a great privilege for myself as well as others. Your are educational and have a resourceful and kindred spirit, both of you, and I think your little one will be exactly the same way. I will pray for your health and hope to see you three in the future. Love  your channel.

do not agree with "if someone is experiencing pain - then someone is experiencing joy". Why can't we all experience joy at the same time?
you will definitely come back bro, don't worry :) we will miss your piece of heaven as well, but reuniting with it will be even more special :) God bless :)
I dont want to disrespect their hard work, they are working very hard there, and build sick staff. Just want to say that i believe that this is their forest and their real house is relatively close to this forest, i believe they are just here "off grid" as vacation, they coming and leaving this place to go to their real house. But that is just my opinion.
Где такая красота находится.
What language is he speaking
I love how they say there “off the grid” as they use a camera and do YouTube!
This is a beautiful video. Impressive. Your story telling skills, editing, just wonderful. Thank you
9:30 putting in a wetsuit is hella easier if you get it a bit damp inside first. Or there's the old secret method some of my scuba buddies use: a little bit of dawn dish soap on your body. You slide right in, and when it gets wet and bubbles, it actually can keep you even warmer as the air is an even better insulator when trapped against your body than the water is.
Never underestimate how good a nice jean jacket is. I've got a lambs wool lined Levi one that was my dad's back in the mid-late 70's, it's all faded and broken in, and I LOVE it. It's so comfortable, incredibly warm, durable, and possibly the easiest coat to clean that I own. And it looks good with everything. Jean jackets are the most underrated clothing item, I love it.
These two will raise the most humble and modest kid you've ever seen. As long as they ensure they get a quality education, living in these sorts of frugal means and creative ingenuity is surely setting their kid up for success, right?
I love you 🌹
Nicole you look fantastic in your pregnancy. Creating life is an wonderful thing.
You two# 3 are very cool people i would love to have something like this im watching from England cant wait to see more cool stuff god bless
Jake give you child what you lost. After the birth in a safe location or at home, whatever you two desire. If you go to a town, head back when the baby is ready. Very smart to think about it yet trust in each other. You will do what is right together as one.
Good day to you two or is it three ,I'm waiting for your next video, 2weeks  was the last one I saw can't wait please please post love watching how you go though  life can't wait to see baby  sending you God's Blessings stay safe love you ❤
What a brilliant video. I've been saving them up to watch over a few hours haha. Thats how I love to watch your videos. So exciting and makes my day so much better. Living in a big city, I dont have much nature to escape too. I very much look forward to your videos.   I cant wait to see your new place xxx

I wish I had this little off grid land. Very smart couple
Hey if the native Indians can do it in remote areas. so can you.
So where are y’all going?????
Beautiful couple
MNAAAAAM ! just give me food and water and i will help whit evrithink ! ! !
Do not be afraid ! trust the nature and space and speak whit them they will guide you if you feal lost ! :) and its normal be afraid when new live coming :)
:3 i hope it will be twins !
Nicolie, my husband has kelp up with you for some time now. He has found some wonderful articles in a magazine called "Pathways" and would like to send them to you. Is there anyway we can do that?  You both have become like family to us and we are so blessed to know you and be a part of your journey!
Hello you 2 how are you doing cant wait to see the next up load.
Felicidades ao lindo casal e Nicole tenha um parto muito feliz e saudável pra  mãe e filho!!
Your pornos are amazing.  Keep up the good work.  You definitely balance each other's your chi.
Where did they disappear to??? I hope everyone is ok!
sorry i don't agree with our yin and yang and energy.  Every creation as u see in the nature u will believe in eternal God the Creator God not energy etc.  You see the beautidul sunset, tress around it all begins in God.  God bless as as you find peace i Him
Life will always be filled with challenges, decisions, planning, family and so.  Focus now is next chapter with baby.  You both have created so many memories over last 3 years.  I thank you for sharing from day one!  Hopefully you will be back at some future date growing family and dreams together.  Thank You!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍❤️
Gosh, I admire you guys.  Life, and society seem so out of balance in our world.
You have to be care full. Winter is hard and specially in very could places, plants are use for medicine, you have to depend on animal food. plants are loaded with toxic chemicals for the body like oxalates and lectins and more.
aweee, the little sea puppy was so curious
bro .. you need to have your child at home on the land ..i will continue my reasons if your interested to here them ...my daughter secora sky is 5 now ...
Any update on the new surroundings and activities?
Missing your videos
Haven’t seen posts lately.  Hope you both are well. 💖
Wowowowowow the ending
Good grief, I can’t watch.  Jake, you’re such a narcissist that you’ll be back.  You couldn’t leave the YouTube money or recognition.  Your views only come from her half naked thumbnails.  Sicko.  Tuning out!
33:21 when?
Really really nice clickbaits 👍🤦🏻‍♂️
Tropical bugout property!??! Heck yes. -- Also, super excited to see the baby! Good luck guys.
it is babe boy :P
Best wishesd ❤️❤️❤️
Gordon Ramsay is my favorite Chef and you’re right I don’t think he would send that plate back… No Kitchen Nightmares here💚
the music choices in these videos are like relaxation for my whole body  and mind, and the feel of my home. i need a play list please @Off Grid w/ Jake & Nicole or any one else that knows these songs/artists.
Could some one please tell me the name of the song that starts around 6:48
You should be grateful for what you have - that is the only thing you can do - thank yourselves for what you have and cherish it! We have a saying - wherever there was water flowing - it will flow again! You are blessed with a child! Look forwards, not bachwards! :)
I love the seal! He just keeps swimming but looks back and checking you out hehe
Its not watch Absolutely not watch ..https://youtu.be/rz-Ng9YlnQY
Amazing
When are you coming back?
Late Happy Holliday to you guys. Nicole you still look beautiful even being pregnant.  Good luck to you three.
You will be back……babies are resilient
Honestly he’s doing the right thing for his lady. I give so much respect for him
Only soy boys cry
Ya le falta poco ya va reventar
Nothing says off the grid living and zen like a Patreon channel hahah
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍
Breast feeding is THE BEST! The connection and the love. On GOD you have no idea what awaits you two lovies. If it doesn't go perfect at first, don't get discouraged. Highly recommend joining an online lactation group if you can. You will need the support of other mamas/sisters. Sending best wishes and blessings to all three of you and the dogs. What a wonderful life you two have created. I did Hypnobirthing and experienced zero pain. One should start when around 5 months, but definitely look into it. All about calming the mind and controlling fear (which is where pain comes from) as well as releasing anything that may be holding you back and prevent a smooth labor process. All the best.
so sad
Good Luck family!!! We pray you have a great new start!!
You guys are an inspiration. It’s ok if you leave it all behind for your child because a child is worth it. However, you can always go back later on when you’re child is older. The memories you have created during those years being in sync with nature and having a balanced yin and Yang will live on forever through the amazing videos you have shared with us. Thank you and many blessings to your new family. Regards from NC, USA.

Tanrım korusun lütfen
Jake, please don't regret losing a garden to nature's ways. Your emotional words are reminiscent of my grandfather's, when the home garden he built and grew was ripped apart by a group of ****ole humans. I tried my best to regrow in an intentionally destroyed land. The taste of homegrown food is irreplaceable!!! You can always resow and regrow, sometimes better than before. The baby obviously comes first. 🙏
Ни чего не понял,но красиво.
i don't know if this is just drama for viewers or he's really this troubled... but to be worried about a garden when a child's safety is on the line sounds mentally unstable. Such a great guy and with so many attributes to be envious of, yet this is really a silly story line... worried about your garden, and yen and yang, and taken away from the mountain... I hope it's for drama and not a mental break from the reality of what's really important in life.
It was interesting at first but then I realized that it was more like a commercial of all the things they own/owned , all for the money. Jake was/is a show off and Nicole just his follower all tho I do like her and wish her all the best. They build a lot but really nothing at all, big mess. And then the ending ??  really ? disappointing.
The life you chose was a hard one. A baby is going to make it harder. Your commitment to it will now be tested ....
Although I can sympathize with you having to delay your dream, I would say get use to it.  We have four children older than you two and eight grandchildren.  You will continue to make sacrifices the rest of your life for your children’s sake.  Here I find myself at 70 finally building the house/cabin on our mountain property we have had for thirty-five years. You may have to relocate for that better paying job which enables you to provide food, clothing, school fee’s, athletics, summer camps, college tuition, assisting with house down payments, etc. it’s what parents do when they are financially able. And my wife and I know that it will be our children and grandchildren who will benefit from the cabin more than we will but I sure am having fun building the place, often with the help of the family members. Family is worth every bit of so called sacrifices and delaying a few dreams, here and there, over the years.
Wish y'all the best.  Jake is VERY talented but this is really rich kids playing in the woods.
how on earth did you get pregnant?
happy for people like you who enjoys their daily life...love you
colle Videos wehr mea If a German subtitle would give the man knows what it's about, greetings from Duteschland
Зачем люди, вы уходите от цивилизации?
Love the ending and poetry
What you’ve build will still be there under Mother Nature care. or maybe a caretaker until you return .  It would make a great business venture also . Extreme Holiday destination that whole place is a full body workout. Foraging and catching fresh seafood. Living off grid. That’s my kind of getaway.
This is really good but why you are not uploading new videos on kungfu taichi center with jack mace 😭
Exciting times ahead, we all cant wait. Stay healthy in Love and safe ok.
I really can't believe that you're leaving what you've worked for, for so long and so hard to make it a reality. All of the hardships..., and now I feel like I've been sucked into all of it with my hopes and dreams because I followed you. I watched you both do things that because I didn't have a plan for living life for myself, or regardless of the way things have gone for me . You gave gave me hope and I dared to dream again and rediscover truly who I am and I am just so very disappointed...., not in you guys but in myself for once again believing..., believing in Good and in Love. This world system that we've all been taught in. What works , what doesn't, what's fair, what's truth is always stealing the joy from our lives, and it doesn't matter or care who you are, your language, your race, your beliefs..... When I was born here to this Earth, my parents and all of the circumstances that entailed. I felt there was something wrong, like Neo in The Matrix movies. I couldn't understand why things were the way the were opposite from what I felt in my very hearts being of being alive and realizing that I was alone in my understanding, and that learning more about everything including myself. Would hopefully lead me to hold onto the Massive amount of connection I felt to pure consciousness..., to LOVE. I won't say anymore because I'm putting it all in my book, and I can't allow myself to put any more amounts of faith in what I see mankind lacks in what it really is to be human. To live, and to love happy and enjoying the many gifts that living is truly about. I know that there are other forces that have been shaping and steering us to failing in compassion, empathy, understanding, peace and blocking us from reaching our highest selves. I will miss you both and I do hope that somehow you will return to what you have built together. Congratulations with your new addition to your family, and thank you for all of the episodes where you gave away hope like it was candy in your pockets. All my love and healing positive energy always.... "O".
Will be a boy! Good luck! ✊👍✋
quando nasce o baby
Why are you leaving I’m going to miss your channel
Beautiful ❤️❣️ h and W
Hey! Let us all have an update.Best wishes. A LOT of people care ❤.
I never thought of this before until now; get a house sitter to take care of the home & the garden. GOOD LUCK with the Baby to COME!
That is awesome.
lucky guy.....just saying
The land is amazing.....Canada?
Waow. You surprised me again. I did not followed your whole path. But from time to time. And i am so glad for you. I am so glad that there are Humans outside in this world who live like that. Who just do it. And who sahre it bit. If i would be allowed to do so, i would walk by your side. I wish you everything waht you need and waht ist good for you. 🙏
Love your videos. Curious - how much of the 4 acres of land is now cleared after the 3 yrs? Thxs!
This is my, probably unpopular, opinion,  but I feel like you are turning away from what I & other followers have enjoyed so much sticking with you guys on.  Hey, if you have the means to just pull up stakes & take off & leave behind what we have enjoyed following your progress on,  then by all means , you do you….  Wish you all the best, truly, I will watch other channels.  Fair winds & following seas…  As the old saying goes, I believe..
Is he a Wing Chun Kung Fu master?
I think that you and Nicole are amazing and will make wonderful parents. I have always wanted to live and survive off grid. Unfortunately, it wasn't my husband's dream.  Luckily, you have been blessed financially to buy whatever you need including properties.  The mammals that you admire are amazing but they survive by eating the weak. Maybe an elephant would be better as they are omnivores. May good luck and blessings follow you in whatever you endeavor
Can someone tell how to play that intro on guitar? What's it called 🤔 lol I'll say it. Its catchy af
Congrats you two ❤️❤️❤️ So sorry u have to make that difficult decision to leave. I don’t know what to tell you or what to do. All i can do is wish you well on y’all journey. Much love u two 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

wonderful off frid forest cabin lovely nature

reetings, I'm from Indonesia on the island of Batam. I love watching the video, it's very inspiring... very compact in completing all work... keep your spirits up and always take care of your health. Greetings to both of you, soon to be on duty right... Good luck and good luck  smooth delivery amen. I really like watching your video.
14:23If the poster could talk, he would probably swear.Why is this guy chasing me?hah
You'll be fine.  My wife and I used to be helicopter parents, fretting over the very minor things...the third child better show some arterial bleeding before we get excited :-).  This is normal in the process of things.  Do what you think is best cause at the end of the day, you are responsible for your own actions...no one else.  Gardens can be grown again, especially as you've laid it out.  Take the time, care for your wife during her/baby's time of need...the rest will take care of itself.  Per the Bible "Matthew 6:27 And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?".  He really does have the whole world in His hands.  You guys seem rooted.  Read His word, pray for forgiveness and get baptized...the rest you'll learn through the study of His word.  Trust in Him and enjoy the time you're given!
Will the child be brought up a vegan or vegetarian, or will that be the child's choice  when  understands
Nicole I think you’re gonna make a wonderful mother!
You guys are really greedy. Sure, living in nature is great but is it really? Right. people who genuinely enjoy living on the land do not have YouTube channels that pad their pockets with money around the clock. Fakes.
you both are amazing...........love from india
You guys were suppose to be vegan

Hello all right, my name is Álvaro and I live in Brazil, I love your videos, and I have a suggestion for the winter, make a greenhouse so you can grow during the winter.
Olá tudo bem, me chamo Álvaro e moro no brasil, adoro os vídeos de vcs, e tenho uma sugestão para o inverno, façam uma estufa para poderem cultivar durante o inverno.
Дай Бог вам здоровья и вашему ребенку !Вы очень силные и устремленные люди!

Nicole have you tried letting it solidify about a third of the way and then whipping it? If you do it will stay whipped and not melt so easily. I make something pretty similar here in AZ and it stays whipped even in the summer.
У вас отличный канал, включите Русские субтитры. Спасибо.
take care~~ happy for your family~

The most important question...What are you going to do with those wonderful dogs of yours? They have made you two their forever family. I`m sickened of the thought they will be forced to start over or worse.
love the environment. Looks so nice

Port Hardy isn't that far. Why would you never come back? Seems pretty dramatic...
God bless you all. I just discovered your channel. How courageous and steadfast you both had to be to build such a nice and comfortable house under such difficult conditions. Keep your happiness, your joy, your hope, your simplicity, your humility and your love.  All my wishes. France
Life is good
I'd white folks can go to Jamaica and live off grid then why is it hard to believe they wouldn't do it I'm their own country.

當群鳥飛起的時候，我的雞皮疙瘩都起來了，不是盲目親近自然，而是用現代的生活方式親近自然。人是地球物種的一部分，有人類的自然世界才是最完整的。唯有用現代的方式切入自然才是保護自然生態的最好方式，就像嫁接……  the birds fly, my goose bumps get up. Instead of blindly getting close to nature, I get close to nature with a modern way of life. Man is a part of the earth species, and the natural world with man is the most complete. Only by cutting into nature in a modern way is the best way to protect natural ecology, just like grafting…
Where u get your pregnancy clothing? Pregnant wife birthday coming up

And i am praying for you and your baby   From Pakistan
I am waiting your cute baby
Enjoy enjoy dear enjoy your life   Cute people and cute life   Love you from Pakistan
Are you guys vaxxed? If not, how did you manage to travel?
Your so beautiful love from Pakistan we are waiting to see your baby in your complete beautiful family Good blessed
Jake , I was watching you in your previous life, in your Arizona vegetable forest and now here! What a difference. What happened to your turtle? I cannot help it - just have to think about Betty MacDonald and her EGG AND I book.. Living off the grit in the egg farm in your area. With one and than too babies. How much she hated it!! And you love it.
What is that intro music track? I like it, It's familiar but I can't name it. I also like this channel.
omg the ending I’m so excited 😆
for a second there i thought it was a leopard seal hahaha i was scared.
Off the Grid, sounds like something the rich kids do when they are bored of their privaliged life and go through a weird patch for a few years and then return to their old life, telling stories of their heroic adventures to their spoilt kids about how brave they are.
I have had friends who have had major skin issues tears scars poison ivy and multitude of various other things later on after the little one is out you may want to try this I know it takes a while for you guys to get things but several jars of the stuff is worth it’s weight in gold at the very least you can get one jar and copy the ingredients
Can’t tell you how much I’ve valued the vicariously living you have given me during this time of COVID isolation. Whether you were building, foraging or showing such affection for each other, it was a beautiful ride and I’m going to miss you two! Thank you so much.   Wait… what? Wrote all that before finishing the vid. Tropics!?  Well, okay! 🤟🏼
Quit using her body for views. It's clickbait and distasteful. Also, that is what only fans is for. This isn't only fans.
From my experience orcas are friendly as long as you don’t mess with the young ones
I enjoy your every day my mind my friend you guys are a year ahead of us and seven years behind us and some regards we started out wanting to travel got an airstream I remodeled it added solar rebuilt floors the wiring the plumbing it was completely self-sufficient it was a little love shack I guess you could say and then the worst could happen one of our neighbors maybe a couple of our neighbors burnt our home down just after we got it back from when our landlord tried to take it from us so we start over in a year we’re on slope of a mountain about 1000 feet up in Nelson county Virginia we’re slowly learning the lessons that you’ve already learned developing new appreciation for the vices that we use to fill the void and finding infinite value in the river that flows past the spot in which we plan to land with our new Home thank you very much for sharing thank you very much for being on a path the Reminders Of ours whether it be the fears or the joys congratulations on the new life that you’re working so hard figuratively and literally congratulations on the expansion of your family deferment of your clan
Good jobs
His thoughts are very real and thought out. Deep if you think about it. I worry of a slip or fall in the snow or ice. Much respect for both of you.
was this the last video??
Our babies are grown.  Now we have miniature long hair dachshunds as our kids AND THEY are just about like kids! LOL.
حياه راىعه
haha that ending was dope!
U r so blessed with each other, I'm jealous guys..... God bless the cumin child tooo..... I just discovered ur channel though.... U r so Lucky guys... God's hands be on you always..
Cant wait for next video
Hi my friend friend from Thailand 🇹🇭 good video
Can we just about that seal though?! Absolutely breathtaking!😍
Men don't give babies, you can try to level up on the baby bump tricks but we all know it's a lie, it's dishonest, and it's done with intent.
You should definitely find another like minded couple or family to take care of the property while you’re away
Living humble? You were destroying everything to build a normal house in the middle of the forest, cameras, boats,  its good for the environment that you're gone.
I hope you and Nicolle come back home.  City life for a few months and then back to work at home. ❤️
Hey Jake, Nicolle! I'm Brazilian, and I must say, this channel is my mental therapy 🌄
This is the first video I have watched on your channel. Both of you are so poetic and awesome!
Just wait till you guys find out she has an onlyfans 👀

You should follow your dreams, if you wait to do it...it won't happen .... So what are your dreams? If it includes owning a tropical getaway, then you should do it...If you are doing it "just for now" then DON'T DO IT. They say everything is a compromise. That's true in relationships and design, but not so for dreams. If you dream is your Canadian getaway, then stay put. If your dream is to also have a liveaboard sailingboat. Then do it...If that also includes a tropical getaway....Ok I think that's just too much.  If it were me and I were your age again, I would stay where you are, and build a sailboat. You have GREAT material all around you, and you can then one day shove off for a year go south and return or go to Japan and back, or the pacific islands....whatever you chose for this or for that year with only getting 1 year of being behind in your chores...which means you can prep for your return with little risk of it all going spoilt or nature taking it all over again. I love your life, and I had plans like yours...I never got to it because there was always "life" in the way. Don't make the same mistakes....figure out what the dream REALLY is, than do it.  My very best wishes to you.
Nicole you are 1 amazing woman! I hope jake counts his blessings every morning waking up next to you! Your smile is infectious
It’s so sad how you have to use your wife for notoriety 👎
I think an off grid wedding is past due... Jake, it's time. 💒 ❤👶
Get back into martial arts and meditation instead of being lumberjack Jake.
can i keep your land for ya? awwwwww
"Wu Wei " means ease before effort !  I don't understand why you do everything the hard way.  Seems like your always winging everything but when you have children you really have to plan way ahead of time and have real strategy. Maybe you should take some parenting course and move far away the only fans account. To me sex is sacred. Me and my wife used to really enjoy your kung fu and tai chi channel it was more pure.  I am disappointed in you using woman to get money and lowering yourself for money. It is the opposite of buddhism and immoral.  Raise your woman up !
I love how he feeds and take care of Nicole it’s the sweetest thing. Beautiful way of showing love.🥰
Ion why but the end had me screaming!!! Yaasss!! New season gone be in the tropics!! They start all over again!! I love y’all!!
Who is taking g over your yurt home and gardens? Selling it?
I'm just gonna cut down trees and destroy nature Stop it!
western 's despair..we ' ve turned to be unable to create tomorrow..just able to go backward to ou ancestors hardy and limited life ..sad future..
jake is built just like joe rogan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yohIulaw7WM&t=28s
Shallow narcisists:)
Does anyone else pay attention to the surroundings in there videos ? I've lately seen some entities in other videos if u go back after u have watched the video normall. Go back and especially when they are outside showing the tree line and surroundings pay attention and u will see lots of movement and lots of tree peekers lots of cloaking. It's the forest people bigfoot / sasquatch. I've even heard whoops and tree knock in some of there other videos.
I wish you the best of luck with your new family.
Jake, your pre father jitters/anxiety is very apparent. Leavening what you've built is defeating the purpose for which you have endevard so hard to create. What about your animals? What will happen with them? This decission to leave now, feels "KNEE JERK" & out of balance!! Just MY overall feeling!! Doesn't feel right!! AHO!!  CABIN FEVER MAYBE?!?!!!😇😉😘
متى انشخطت ذي؟؟؟ قبل شهر ما فيها شي!!!
Happy new year
Dude can I go stay and maintain until you return?? Hort major, landscaper, bonsai enthusiasts. Father of 1 six year old boy.??? Ill go tomorrow!! Grafting skills, propagation skills, Michigan derby living in Louisville, looking for a way back to the woods. You can coach, dictate, delegate to no end. Think it over.  I dive, fish, hunt traditional bow, trap, tan leather, and long for such a place as beautiful as yours. Maybe even carve out a neighboring spot for a community. Few ppl who knows
Do you hear yourself. LOL
Please keep checking on your place or vandals and father time will take over.
Maybe you should take a break from you tube !
All that work for nothing ! Wow !
Intresting and nice to follow you off grid living. A big offer and experiment with lot of knowns and unknowns we Evert van presume.... Fanstatic and congrat's to now be a family ❤️ When Child has grown Up I Guess you both is back... With the Hole family and a dog 🐕‍🦺... 💪👍 Good luck and see you When?
تذكرت أيلام الحصار بحمص 😁
God Bless your new journey Jake and Nicolle and your precious new arrival, stay safe and careful. Wherever your new journey lands you and family, stay Blessed and happy, remember God is with you guy’s wherever you land. God Bless love’s 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾
👍😘🚶‍♂️🌲
🙏🙏💐🌹🇲🇽🇲🇽💖💖
A MOTHERS BEST FRIEND LOTION IS THE BEST FOR STRETCH MARKS! JS!
People survived in the forest for 100’s of years.  Get it together, man.  You’re doubting your ability to take care of something other than a plant. You’ve been taking care of Nicolle (and she you) for quite some time. Look at all you’ve accomplished!
created life is so beautiful. Having a baby is one of the most beautiful things in this world😌❤️
Happy New Year to you both.Wishing you guys the best through the rest of the pregnancy.🤩🤩
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Brazil,... Quê maravilha a vida em sintonia com a natureza, quem sabe com mais vídeos desses o ser humano aprenda a importância da natureza em nossas vidas e de como ela pode cuidar de nós se a tratarmos bem, parabéns.
I was surfing the videos on YouTube and your vids came up ... watched a few as a city person I really respect what you both have you have done.   With a little one on the way too... It seems like constant work and grow and adapt and build.  Showing us a different way of living.
I knew that this period of their lives would reach a peak which would require a major change and having a child together became the catalyst. Both of them have a strong sense of adventure which cannot be denied and their life on this island has some really strong built-in limits. Their skills at filming, music selection, and onscreen presence have reached a peak that guarantees a profitable audience to pay for their next transition in life - and, to their credit, they walked through the door that was open in front of them.
Home is where you are! If it is not, you have become lost in search of where you believe your happiness decided to leave, taking your peace away from within! Maybe the key is to take your peace & happiness with you no matter where LIFE takes you ?!!!.
Happy new Year 2 three of you,&i wish all  ☺️✌ of u being healthy and happy
wow total tree huggers....isten to that poem thing he read at the start of the video lol.....and im from wyoming im all about the outdoors...dude sounds like a gay male yoga instructor
Wonderful video.
I said this day would come. No place for a baby to be born. No vegees now, You need real food.    Arn't  those shellfish considered non-veegan ?   They are tasty are they not ? Make great stew too !   I still don't understand why you don't live in the yurt ! Mold, cat & dog smell, what ? Strange  ! Good luck to you both. God Speed !
10:12 I thought that was a joke, but the underwater video is worth it
Aww you should get your dogs coats for the boat rides! That's gotta be cold for them too. They make great gear for dogs! I have an Aussie myself! I love them so much! My Koda turned 14 this year! Such loyal dogs for sure and so smart!
Jake, perhaps you could consider adding a hot water heater to your stove pipe.  Using thermal siphoning (similar to your hot tub) but inside your yurt or bedroom.  Copper coil example:  https://youtu.be/5IRLVCJ1olA  Wishing you both a blessed journey together.  Peace
You uttered golden words Jake; wishing you and Nicole happy parenthood as your child will be entering the real world in few months. Praying for Nicole’s safe delivery and waiting to get updates from you guys in your next episode. Until then stay safe!
danger orcas  atention
Love how natural you look,and live.Your child is very fortunate to have parents that are survivalist and great people.
The female body is a machine
I'm Roberto from Brazil, and  just want to wish very,very blessing over you 2, ops, 3. I dont know if you believe in God, but HE love's you. I'm shore about that. Jesus be with you in this so much important moment of your lives. Excuse my bad english. Be happy. God bless the baby and the birth. Have a big day cople.
Are you planning on having a water birth? :3
You glow so beautifully
Hi Jake, I feel your pain leaving your dream. 1,5year ago I had to leave mine. 12 years building our own homestead. With cows and nature contributing to provide nutrients for the people in the Netherlands. My dream of feeding people in a way that doesn't harm nature, but helps ecosystems. Family problems where the cause me, my wife and our two kids had to leave the farm. It makes me sad. My relationship with my dad is terrible at the moment. But I realize that new challenges are ahead. For example every moment I spend with the kids and my wife are so much intense now. Sometimes I am really longing back for the farming life. But I know: all my experiences will make a better man, husband and father. May God quide you the direction for you and your beautiful family!  Greetings Corné Love your way of pure living BTW.
You're both so awesome. Wow. Savage live with support some technical tools. I wish you everything the best. Hero.
Jake don't be afraid.  Fear is the devil trying to scare you. I've enjoyed you four and komarebi so much because your life I wish to one day have.  Please if you have to leave which is understandable please come back.
I wouldn't want to suggestively show my wife's ass on the global internet to make money with my YouTube channel. It is at least of bad taste, but above all reckless and dangerous.
You are great. Nice to watch your videos👍
So you both finally realized that by eating vegan you were harming your health? Better late than never!
Cant wait for the next video 😇
even more off grid soft core :)
awesome. simply awesome
Congratulations to both of you, if you weren't so far away from me, I would really like to come to you, you are living real life.
❤💋💋💋💋💋
Thank you for sharing your story with us in lansing Michigan USA. You are a inspiration for what can be done to improve one's health body and mind. Thank you again, your friend Rex Swindlehurst.
The baby grew up a lot! I wish you happiness.
nice
Should have thought of  having to leave and wore a condom!!!!!
You have to raise your baby off grid.
If I lived there have a helicopter
It's a girl , girls carry high &  boy's carry low
Wait..? Are we talking about “concern for a garden”..OVER THE SAFE BIRTH of their child? Nahhh, can’t be…
🤔
How do you keep the bears away?
Whats happening to the pets? I hope youre taking them with you!
I feel like a grandpa! thank you.
I would be willing to bet you guys are setting up on Calvert Island.  I am wishing you all the best but please do not abandon Komorebi.  Thank you for taking us along on your journey and we will follow along on your next.
I guess its time to unsubscribe.
omg im soo hyped for the tropical property tropical food forest all year round
Wonderful video. Great underwater filming! Man I would love some of those scallops! 😄
is it normal for their videos to be so overexposed? :/ i can't tell if my computer's glitching or if their footage is just extremely washed out?
Study Gods word Jake, that feeling is the Holy Spirit! I have followed you before you ever met Nicole.The beauty you created in the dessert was amazing. It is very important to put down roots somewhere and be happy with your family! There are challenges everywhere, but that peace you both have enjoyed is far away from what most of the world is caught up in! People don't even take time out of their busy lives to even acknowledge the beauty around them.I know you both will find your way!
Pongan subtitulos en español para seguir viendo tus videos gracias 🙂
Finding chi, and tranquility involves doing porn, interesting that baby is going to be happy growing up.
You've been reading a lot of new age books foah shoah!
SPring is 10 weeks away....You will come back & see your fruits and veggies again....Keep baby and momma safe by staying close to a hotel or B&B near a hospital...Not so far from a hospital when time gets closer for birth...God forbid there is a complication during birth you need to be near doctors...
What a beautiful couple!! I love these videos 😍😍 would love to live out in the wild
Oh my lord thats a beautiful thumbnail 👀😍       congratulations 🙏🏻
I don't know what going on with the two of you but live today. I don't mean don't plan for tomorrow please plan. Think about what is best for all meaning family. Take care of your family 👪.
NO WAY!!!
Baby and Safety First, regardless of where you live!
Do they make their own gasoline for the boat motor
No matter where people go they'll always see their surroundings as a reflection of themselves for good or bad and few recognize the vanity in it. Jake is more of an extrovert than he realizes since he sees his in almost an anthropomorphic haze which can be both a strength but dishonest at the same time. The philosophy of Yin and Yang always fascinates me because its that binary and at times malevolent since its causality can be that ugly in its believers. Does Jake believe that his karmic doppelganger lives in misery so he can gather mushrooms and shell fish with Nicole probably not but thinking otherwise is troubling since its the epitome of narcissism in they did....
Счастья Вам и Удачи в Новом 2022 году.   //\\  I wish you happiness and good luck in the New Year 2022.
I’ve enjoyed you at Komorebi from the start  Thank you for sharing and inspiring me to reach my goals of happiness  Happy Baby! It will be your biggest challenge yet!
Thank you for sharing.  Much love to you two.
Love U guys. we wait in the tropics!. You did it!!!
I see you for so long guys from the day that you construct the first house I follow in every chapter and we my mayor respect Jake the problem here is that you guys take the LORD out of your equation,,,and that is unreal...you believe in Chinesse kind of religion that is not real bro !!!! is going to take to much time that the LORD Jesus is the only way hje create everything that you have even if you say not is very clear HE say very clear I'm the Lord ,the ONLY ONE ,the first and the Last after or before me is nothing.... I respect you guys you are so young and one day you going to remember this experience and realize that you are there because the LORD create everything for you before you Born...We love you Guys  an again I respect your belief. but a kid is going to born and the Chinese philosophy is not going to help in nothing !!!! Because the only truth is Jesus Christ ...GOD bless you always !!! We pray for you guys and I wish the best of the best for you and your kid ....GOD bless you.
Porn stars! Wow...its too much😱😷😶
Good Luck !
Wishing you guys the best through the rest of the pregnancy. I only discovered your channel a couple weeks ago. I wish I could have been following along from the beginning so it felt more like I was living the experience with you. Sadly, I don't believe it's an experience I will ever have for myself. Not in the same way. I'm only 30 but my family of 5 is already deeply rooted in a contemporary life style. And my wife, you has watch a few of your videos with me, could never make that lifestyle work. But now I'm working my way through from the beginning of this channel and excited to learn some things. Like gardening and your vegan life style. Two things I've been interested in learning more about for a while now.
Why leave all the hard work but back in the days that’s how people use to live why leave that peaceful place..!!😞😭
should have pulled out
The ending was amazing!!! Looking so forward to hearing more about that tropical spot!!!
Greetings Sifu Jake and Nicole , I first would like to say that I admire what the two of you have done and the bravery to go in the wilderness and make a home. I wish you both the Lords blessing in everything you do. You both extend positive energy to the universe and harmonize with what is real..the way we were supposed to be. I admire your strength ,perseverance and the willingness to share together. Life itself is so very precious. Many people waste their lives on many material and empty things that bring nothing but regret in the end. Materialism doesn't bless the soul it destroys it. Both of you emanate love , perseverance and true life energy.   What you both are doing; few have the bravery to do ...and few only know how normal it is. The world would be a better place if there were more people like the two of you to show the love and simplicity of life. Blessings to you both and your endeavours. If I can thank you both on behave of everyone that view your videos .... I say thanks:) Gods blessings.:)
Iloveyou guys and ihope to seyou again watching from phillipines.
Very nice 👍❤️
I can not wait for your next video in the tropics.  You have made the most awesome videos of your lives. Thanks for sharing.
nice  couple  . near to nature .and  we love u . i m  from  pakistan   the islamic  republic
You should have installed cable.
Jake, stop grunting every time you lift something. I know those Felco’s are sharp but their not that heavy😂😂😂
Such an amazing and brave lifestyle.  I am in awe..  Best of luck to you and your child..  with much luv from the universe..
I'll be waiting for the next chapter 😌 Jake and Nicole
What's the best chain saw Jake?
may soon be a reality for a bunch of us way world keeps going. model of safety cutting in jeans again one day its gonna come back to bite you. fairy remote area
What a waste of time all this was they will never return here now..
Please stop making Nicole feel bad about being pregnant.  What is more important to you Nicole and your child or the gardens?  I don’t think Nicole would keep you from your gardens, but please stop making her feel less important to you than your homestead.  She has supported you in every way on your journey.  Look at the reactions to what you are saying…watching your comments about being ready to cry , you are breaking her heart.
Great episode! Fabulous ending! Looking forward to yr tropical bug-out life…and the baby, of course. ♥️
Why would you stop filming. I know it is a lot of work but we as the public enjoy these videos so please continue.
You didn’t grow up here, you were born in Richmond. You had to move to Arizona cuz your dad was forced to sell his shares in his company because he was being blackmailed for cheating on your mom. You grew up in a beautiful house and when you moved to Arizona, you lived in a multi-million dollar mansion and attended the best schools in Paradise Valley. Your grandfather funded your FAILED business and you really should repay your grandmother the $40 grand. Your brother and sister had their college educations funded by your grandfather and even Jonathan wanted MORE money to become a teacher after he already had his masters. I hope you sold this place and got a decent profit from it. It’s time to grow up Jacob. First you’re vegan, then not, you NEVER wanted children because of China’s over population and now you’re having a baby.  Pay back your grandmother and start paying taxes like the rest of us. God bless you and your new family but it’s time you become RESPONSIBLE for your failed actions. New life in a tropical area. Are you nuts???? Start being responsible and set an example for your child. smh. 🤦‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
What is the name of video music? Please.
НАРОД МИРА !!!! ГОТОВЬТЕСЬ К КИБЕРТЕРОНИИ ВАС ХОТЯТ ЗАГНАТЬ В СТОЙЛО !!! А ЕСЛИ НЕ ВЕРЕТЕ КИТАЙ ПОГЛАДИТ ВСЕ СТРАНЫ!!! ИСКУСТВЕНЫЙ ИНТЕЛЛЕКТ ПОРАБОТИТ ВСЕ НАРОДЫ МИРА !!! ДУМАЙТЕ! ПРИДЕТ АМБРЕЛА ИЛИ СКАЙНЕТ!!! ЭТО НЕ ФАТАСТИКА А РЕАЛЬНОСТЬ , КАРОНОВИРУС ЭТО ДОКАЗАЛ НА ПРИМЕРЕ!!!
Are scallops vegan??? 😆
Let me guess, you guys are moving to Puerto Rico
Share your body for likes.
Whoa, you got alot of baby proofing to do around there! Good times! LOL 😆
What are you talking about. People take longer vacations than the time your going to be gone. Your not going to come back to nothing. You just come back and start up from where you left off. And if you have to repair or rebuild something big deal. You took something that was nothing and made it not only beautiful but also functional and life sustaining. Where is all this negative coming from it’s not you or Nicole’s way of being. You guys are always Mr. and Mrs Positivity. So where is all this negativity coming from. You guys need to go have this baby and then come back and move forward plain and simple.
We pray to God our heavenly father for the birth of your baby in Jesus name amen.
I would have thanked the lord before eating instead of myself through the whole meal...just what i saw.
its settled then your a YING.  YANG
love the peck flex at the end  !  hope we get lots more baby making videos in the tropics !!

Enjoy life to the fullest and remember you have brought a new life in this world  show them all the wonderful beautiful creations of the world to you and you family be the man and dont ever be afraid of growing togetherness and happiness
It is good that you’ve decided not to have your baby in such a remote location. Instead of dwelling on your own sadness about being away from the yurt-house for the next 2  months .........find happiness/strength in the fact that you will have access to medical help for Nichole and the baby if there is a last minute health crisis. It’s time to think like a real Dad!!
Ok

Video good
Nice

Worst episode ever, can’t do the poetry, but good luck
I wish you and your wife a very happy and healthy new year every day
Probably better you don’t use essential oils of any strength for the cream. My daughter tells me it’s a little intense for the baby. Perhaps you could make your own decoction of fragrant herbs to add
John 1 The Word Became Flesh  1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
Jesus,  You were not ready.
Last in the video l was in shok.Leaving???? Omg…. And than l saw ur going to wamer weather… So l understand u folks. Im just happy to follow ur next jouney 🥰whish u all the best .congrats !
So sweet!
Seeing you reminds me of the younger days, my wife's pregnancies and the changes of life. Enjoy it! Tropical paradise? Can't wait... blessings in your final trimester 🙏
I believe you guys made the right decision 😊
I can't believe what I am hearing what you are saying, in the beginning of this video!!  So, it seems to me, that you care more about your garden then your unborn child.  Like REALLY??  That could  be wrong, but that's the impression I got.   I pray I am  wrong.
The winters must be hard on northern Vancouver Island, especially when you're isolated, without central heating and electricity. And, of course, its also dark for a good part of the day at this time of the year.  The dark and rain gets to you  Yup, being a Vancouverite, I get it.  The tropics sound very inviting. Guess they will be in, what looks like, Hawaii? for a while if they're talking about starting over again.  It did take J & N almost three years to get as far as they did in BC.  Hopefully, someone will be staying at their BC property and their animals found good homes, if they aren't making the trip.  Good luck to them and the baby in their new tropical paradise.
Jake you are wise and will be a great dad .   When your wife starts getting closer she will know, she will be preparing, ( nesting ) Then you can take some time off homestead have neighbors or friends sit on your property while you take her where she has family and once the baby pops out . Then hi-tail it back home to the homestead because after your first child you have that to under your experience/understanding and you will feel better . I when home from hospital after 4 hours from delivery so after that I wished. I could have some sleep but my husband said that the baby snuggled between my breast and started to move around when she got hungry.   I know not everything goes right all the time I lost a baby at 38 weeks. This is not to frighten you two but things can happen and there wasn’t anything I did or didn’t do . It’s just life.   You two have been through a lot and this is just a Mather path/journey as you plan each tree and give it your time,food and water everything it needs you will do it for your baby to.  I have great warm and loving thoughts of you guys doing this with the balance it takes.  Lots of love Patty , 68 yr old worry wort too but GOD got this
I like your little wood stove that hangs on the wall in the bunkie. What is it called? Where can I find it? Best to you both as you move forward and expand your little family.
Build  a run way at the home, for your sons and daughters,  Captain  Jake get your wings , Your Garden is alive ,will always be, Your fears are BS your dreams are real
I think it’s a good idea to be closer to medical care if necessary.  You will be back Jake.  Your baby will be safer off the grid, with all the crap going on in the USA.
Николь и Джейк! Вашей семье благополучия!
Excellent waiting for baby
Click bait
OMG IM SO HTING ON YOUR WOMAN RIGHT NOW LOL, SHE LOOKS SO DAMN GOOD AND SO SMALL STILL!!!!! I GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT WHEN I WAS PREGGERS BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T EAT ALL THE TIME I FELT SICK LOL
ALL I SO WANT IS TO STOP SMOKING CIGARETTES BUT CANT DO IT COLD TURKEY ! I NEED CHANTIX SO I CAN GO OFF GRID AND NOT NEED STUPID SMOKES EVEN IF I CAN MAKE THEM MYSELF WITH A MACHINE I BOUGHT I WANT THAT ALL GONE FROM MY LIFE!!
That was those two high on the wall and she put it down low with a heat hits the  building
Are you no longer vegetarian?!
😘😘🇨🇭
Just put your wet trees in the smoke house, I recommend cutting only what you have to before you smoke the wood. I’m sure there’s much better away I’m not really much of a thinking mood today
Have you ever noticed the noises that the ocean makes how even the things in the ocean take their sound with them. Dolphins Wilde dolphins are usually friendly, why I wonder. My cousins were saved by wild dolphins saved from sharks they got pulled out by the tide on board that you paddle and stand on.
Are you not going to give birth in Canada?
“Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you. Isaiah 60:1
Love  the way you are living off the land and sea. Looking forward to seeing your journey and family grow in a off grid life style.  I will be waiting for the tropical location updates.  Best of health and happiness to you.
hi you guys my friend you are a gentleman...bravo .....from greece.......

Fear, pride and ego are the 3 character attributes that cause failure.  Avoid them at all costs and all will be well because you will always do what is necessary to succeed at anything because of the hundreds of good character attributes you have and hold dear.  Enjoy this wonderful time in your life and do not let fear ruin it for the both of you.  You will never get this time back to do over so make the most and not the least of it.
Not a figment of your imagination,......it is real,..hard work,sweat,tears and joy of life,...good days are always coming,,who knows,..you might find greater joys,...I enjoyed comorebi with you,thank you!!!!
Pretty Impressive you's two. Gotta ask, have you given thought to sustaining this life when your Old?
32:44 what absolutely idiotic behaviour, honestly.
Click bate 😭
So much drama. You just go and come back in 6 months. Meanwhile you live in comfort with the income stream from YouTube ($900K or so?).  I find it hard to believe your life in the forest is really what it appears to be.
o mevsimde ağaçmı budanırmış anlamış değilim.
Been watching your channel for awhile love the out doors the freedom the remoteness nature I live in New Zealand with my wife and kids it's beautiful here the weather is warm cold at times but great for growing produce animals and seafood is great this would be the ideal place for you and your family to live long and prosper thank yous for your experience and showing me how to live off grid hope to see more thanks
You having a little boy
You would have the best baby ever  Freedom to grow in nature
Dangerous animals got no respect  Your family comes first
Please properly fence this place if the baby would is there  Please, please  Get more than 2 dogs Dangerous animals walk where they can  It's so t be two adults anymore can't will be there
GOD BLESS U ALL
Hi, I'm a new subscriber as I find myself watching more and more of your off grid cabin living and it always amazes me how much energy and passion you and Jake have  to do all of this and my hats off to you both. I have 3 kids 23, 21 and 14. My 21 yr old was born early Christmas morning @ 4:40 a.m. My Mom ,bless her soul as she passed January 21st 2019, but she was pretty accurate at guessing if my kids were boys or girls. My Mom said if your pregnant all around and the tummy area and hips, your having a girl and if you can't tell your pregnant when looking at you from behind, then it's a boy. Either way as long as the baby is healthy everyone is happy!! I'm glad I stumbled upon your videos and keep up the strength, admiration and passion about what your doing because I know I am an admirer from Ontario, Canada!👶🌲🍼🍡🎠🧸
God bless you sir & ma'am. 🙏 💕 Thanks for everything. Stay safe and optimistic in these uncertain days of covid19. 💓
Are those paper bark trees in the background 33:15? Are you guys coming to Australia!?! Or maybe Hawaii omg this is so exciting! Definitely has to be somewhere tropical 🌴🌴
❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
Jake * Nicole,  it must be a real task doing all the video's and work around your Homestead. I would tell you what your having, but I don't want to spoil the surprise you both are trying to have.
pregnancy is not a disease. have some faith in your wife...
Your drum size is increasing day by day
hey jake i saw the plants are suffering from frost. some may regrow, some may die. i think its time for you to create a green house to protect plants or even tree from frost. some plants are not adaptive to snow.
Just like people to find the negative...the bad.....Instead of all the good they did !!!! So they did some porn?!!! big deal....I have a sex life too and im free to do whatever i want with it ....judge meif you want...,I just like them dont live life according to comments!!
Jake - Nicole, you need to remember that life is about cycles and you are beginning a new cycle with a family to include in your journey! The symbol for balance should be spinning, but people don't see the graphic except as a stationary symbol - but life isn't stationary !!!  Trust me when I tell you that you can include others in your journey because you both have included all of us so you can expand your family there and return to continue to grow... Have the courage and the faith to believe in your dreams and goals and the strength to grow and be more than you are..... Together... Sending all the positive thoughts and prayers for you and your family - Tim
Are you both crazy !!! No way can you leave this paradise. Wasn't the whole dream that you have actually created worth something ? I know you have the Baby on the way but didnt you both think this through when you decided to live this incredible life. Isn't peace and serenity in that idilic place not warming your soul's enough ? That's what you both moved there for wasn't it ??? The outside world is presently Maniacal and you want to go back to it with you new baby??? Just about every one on the planet dreams of having a life like yours in such a mind blowing enviroment. Please listen to a 74 yr old world trekker who thinks you should stay were you are and adapt to your new baby. Love and admire you both
Have you considered to ask some persons to come and live at your place while you are gone and take care of the garden?
God bless you guys 😇
Life is all about that balance... You’ll be back when your little seed has blossomed and it is safer to be isolated 🌱🌿 They will grow up with little muddy feet, love, risk, adventure, and appreciation for the life all around them 🖤
I watch all your vedios here you uploaded So amazing and famblous ..... This one volg is super duper amazing your ist 3 mints full of motivational massage for us too.....u saved ur garden in the face of volges ...if passed amazing time in forest .
You are having a boy 👦
This chee wee stuff is BS. Good luck though.
((((((you are unique and we adore you ..... when is the baby coming? ...... kisses from strasbourg ))))))
What a great cliffhanger!
Vous etes trop beau :)
Best of luck on the new adventure. Can't wait to see how it goes, and totally jealous of your lives. I'm too old for this type large adventure, but I do have 200 acres to play with and may put a yurt on my land for an escape from my "city" life.
Hi Nicole, I have been watching you guys for a while now and love what you guys are doing. I notice that you are very close to the hot burning stove with your belly. Please try and avoid been too close to the hot fire as  it can cause a strawberry birthmark on babies lovely face. an old Tongan myth. Keep doing what you guys are doing love your channel regards Lupe
Ok you guys...you got me. You rascals.
Who’s the baby’s father?
*Until that child is born most parents-to-be cannot comprehend how that tiny, brand new person will somehow feel like they’ve always been there.*  *Change should never be feared. It shows that there is life, growth and new adventures to be experienced.* 😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My mother’s  inherited ancient wisdom  says its a baby boy..:)
children? you will figure it out....
oh my word You two are a dream!!
What are the red parts of the scallops?
Theres nothing more gross than a big pregnant belly, especially when the woman always has her hands allover it rubbing it and showing it off..
this dude gives me the creeps.
Słuchaj  wiem  pisze po Polsku. Ale nie mów swojej małżonce je jest tak albo tak. Nie mów ze jesteś silna lub dasz rade. Sam dostałem opierdol od pani lekarz. !!! Daj Nicole jest SILNA! I ma oparcie w Tobie lecz nic nie mów, a będzie wszystko, ok. Mowi to ojciec 3 dzieci :). Bedzie wszysko ok.
Sledze Wasz profil choc nie znam angielskiego... Podoba mi sie sposob Waszego zycia. Ciesze sie, że bedziecie mieli dzidziusia. Serdecznosci❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You can show people how you can be away from a garden, neglect it a bit, and see how it will survive and thrive without daily nurturing.  It will survive and you three will benefit from it.  This is an educational channel so you’ll just be educating on being brave and letting things be.
I would love to see you in warmer climate.  For not too long we'll be connecting to the Inner Earth where men live in perfect harmony with nature.  Your pioneer spirit is key to disclosures, to true freedom and liberty, to unlocking the soul to higher self.  Focus on the now, not the past.  There's no fear in perfect love.
I am so thankful yo have stumbled onto your videos. You are very strong individuals really making a vision if possibilites. Plz dont stop making videos. So appreciative to view your experiences as you live them, priceless. Good luck in the last trimesester of pregnancy. So much respect for your way of life and wonderful that your child will have this special life. Best wishes
No way! A baby on the way, Dad’s nervous AND A TROPICAL BUGOUT PLACE?? WOW! All good. All exciting! You are LIVING! Health, Love and Blessings! ❤️
Happy New Year to the 3 of you, plus 2 dogs & 2 cats. I'll really miss this paradise you have both made and hope one day you return, but I also look forward to your next venture in life. Take Care & Stay Safe, Hugs UK
Has Jake ever not had a full cut wood firewood shed, always since the beginning of watching, it was an absolute to have firewood at all times! Something is amiss here. I believe they sold the acreage and moving on especially the way he talked and what it said at the end! And that’s okay too! What a journey y’all have been on and a greater journey on a tropical island, still ahead for your precious family to come. Much love whatever has been decided, y’all have taught us much with your knowledge and discernment.❤️🙏🥰❄️👍🎊😎😘
Well you most likely will not have a another video until after the baby, so I'm going to congratulate you both now, and best wishes for a healthy childbirth.  Now I just want to say you may feel most of your work is done on Komo Rebi, but all of your hard work in general, I believe has only just begun, LOL!  Because it may be time to consider building a second homestead, a Monolithic Earthbag Dome, perhaps somewhere in the Arizona desert, in the following Manner:   https://youtu.be/v0QBrqH_FIc
hai bro...plsprovide some cloths to sister....winter..pregnent .....why try to expose her....let u know..u r viewers r with liking..not like expose u r wife..god bless u with healthy baby..not like u  jake
Surely you guys could sell it.
Make sure all the seafood is OK for a  Pregnant  woman to eat.🍻💐💐
I'd be more afraid of the orca's 😁. You two are awesome
Killer whales are colorblind I think they go by shapes. Is in your heart vibrations.
Is congratulations so happy for you too I hope it's a little girl little girl then you can have 2 more boys.👍🍻💐💐💐💐
Jake and Nicole? Fear IS A LIAR.
Gently remelt your belly butter and add you essentials oils. Quick and it’s ready for you!
😄 love the ending! So excited to see  what you have next!! :)
Adorable curious seal! 🦭
👍👍👍🤰🎄
The best seafoods my frnd,for ur health,von voyage..
I grew up in a Tasmanian fishing village . Grew up splitting and eating fresh scallops and fish from the sea on the same day it was caught. Tasmanians do not remove the roe from the scallop. We prepare them with the beautiful variety of colours the roe comes in. Pale orange to deep red. These were huge shellfish. I found myself thinking “ don’t throw away the roe”…… and you didn’t 👌
Are we going to see how you're getting to your tropical location?  Getting there in a sailboat doesn't sound like a minor voyage.
You touch,my hart,sprit and soul ,and i love you all.jake,and my forest Angel ,kai.puma.all my love.
The dramatics brother... lol! Looking forward to future videos on the tropical property. Very cool 😎
TRUE MASTER.
Um dia por acaso assisti um vídeo de vocês Nicole e Jake e nunca mais parei. Fiquei admirada do lugar e da forma incrível que vocês decidiram viver.   Sou fã de vocês. Sucesso para vocês.
These comments are rough. So many haters. If you don’t like the channel quit watching. I like these kids and hope they prosper and bloom
Please do not leave us all as many of us can only see this way of life and will never see it any other way.
Epic Channel
So happy for you two. Glad you are getting closer to medical care, relieves some of my anxiety.
I can understand your fear Jake. You know it will never be the same... I lost  6 of my 9 ponys in 10 years. It will change every time i had to let them go because of als age. I thought i would not survive but i did...    Now 3 left and i am 72.. Life goes on.....and You will be a Dad... jou will raise the garden again... You will service You will never give up....
God bless.
Fear is your worst guidance. Let it only be a warning. Follow your path, guided by balance  and compromise.
Hopping on to make sure Jake knows the Sufi saying "a pregnant woman is always right"
Know anyone who can caretake your holdings?  Can Nicolle find a midwife back in town?  Love your show, thanks for sharing your journey.
thank you so much for sharing theses last 4yrs.(please)hope to see  you again
Nicolle and Jake I want to say thank you to the both of you for allowing me to see parts of your journey into all your projects. Also into your journey into becoming parents. I feel very Honored that you are sharing with all of us. Be safe, live, laugh, and love whole heartedly.
You will not be free of oil. You should be thankful for those things. Without oil, it would be much harder to move around or cut trees, etc.
Isn't it possible to entrust a caretaker? Who would take care of the garden, the building while you are away.
SSSSSTOP FREAKING US OUT!! LOL YAY CONGRATULATIONS!!
Романтики походу 👍
💞💐
Praying that u all are able to return quickly and that things will come back as you need.  Make a point of visiting as much as possible
you are being selfish, expecting the woman and a child to grow up in isolation is ridicules. Humans are social creatures and need to be around other people to grow up healthy.
never prune a tree in the winter
Keep on keepin on! Stay save, be smart and take care of yourselves. New adventures should be no problem for the 3 of you!
Why would you say, "SAD Day?" You are with your beautiful 7 mos. beautiful what, GF or wife what ever love of your life? you are with Nature, That's like with GOD around you unless you're an Atheist! Everywhere you look with you around you, you --and SAD? You have everything you need? That's more than NOAH could ASK for.

Nicole's baby is going to be a boy. She is carrying it all mostly out front. When it is a girl, women tend to spread out more in the hips. That is why I believe the baby will be a boy, because she is carrying mostly out front. You almost cannot tell she is pregnant from behind. Namaste, 🙏 Jake and Nicole. Live long and prosper, 🖖 kiddos. Peace be upon you and may God's blessings go with you always, 🤟 people.
yoga parties and what not. im fucking disgusted.
shut it down and go back to your target and william sonamona shit.
did you just conflate chicken egg, with the texture and outcome of scallop roe? Gordon Ramsey would just ignore you.
thank you for these blessings of your video, jake.  im so blessed. and by all our techniques.
here jake: "DESCRIBE-NOW".  just copying you.
right now, this is not a good story of work, and mothering. this feels sketchy, like he's a flake, and a loud-mouth. im wanting to leave, yet horified enough to watch.
hes in that stage thats so hard for narci fathers': meaninglessness. these videos are starting to show him producing himself. while you are pregnanting.  obviously he is a child-man. and doesnt know what to do. it will be good when he says he is a child man.
Nice
Wise decision to move for the baby, I think.. All the best and stay in balance the two of you🍀
have a bit of research on raspberry leaf tea  -   (assuming you are not across this already)
Praying for a safe third trimester and home delivery.  I am a labor and delivery nurse for 27 years and know even the lowest risk delivery can go wrong. I also know In third world countries lots of babies and Mom's die without access to hospital care.
I can't wait for your baby to be born, and you guys will be so happy
Did you ever find proof of Sasquatch
It’s a baby girl since you are so pretty during your pregnancy
Give your child a good and safe house (log cabin that has a comfort room inside
But, Jake weren't you the bigest advocate for the vegan life style? What happend????
🙌💕💕💕💕💕
So Great! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdYbEaC9i8
Happy new years. Weather it out. Great strength comes from it.
My God! Nicolle is huge, sure there isnt 2 or 3 kids in there? I didnt show till my 7th month. Holy cow, I hope everything goes ok for you. Your going to buy a 60' catamaran!
The deception of ting and yang has nothing to do with the LIVING LOVING GOD(creator) who loves all people HE CREATED in His image so much He gave His only begotten Son Christ Jesus!!!!
i believe you are going to have a boy!
I think you will be back with your child if God allows you too  Happy New Years, and many more , God bless you all and child. Mr. Tony Stevens.
It’s so relaxing to watch your video. I love off grid life
Just...WOW!
So glad to see you both doing so well in spite of difficult decisions.  What about the dear dogs and cats?   Be well and safe.  Blessings to all of you.
Think this is my favorite video I have seen of yours.
A very nice belly button.  Nonsencical  tattoos. You are a good photographer.
Happy new year 2022 and you having sin in the family
Is it impolite to ask what on earth you are doing to those little stick trees?
05,2022👍👍👍🇹🇯
I love watching the progress but jake talking about love, balance and all this cry baby shit is turning me OFF !!!!!
Of course they are leaving it all behind. Nobody can live this “chi” life without depending on their gasoline, stihl chainsaws, and raising babies without medicine nearby.
Tried to watch but jakes bs still hard to watch
That’s quite some Wetsuit. Hopefully the water is not too cold. It looks like it’s very cold out there because he’s Lil Dicky shriveled up even more
Your mister has to be so proud of you, you are so beautiful being 7 mo, i think you both will make wonderful parents, i wish you the very best in the new year. Thankyou for all the shows you've made i think they are all wonderful !!!😊😊😊😊
The thumb nails pictures are just getting more and more sexual. Why? Are you hurting for clicks and subscribers? I don't get it. You guys are great homesteaders and don't need to expose your body to get likes and views. Its a shame, but I just can't take your channel seriously. Cheap thumbnail pictures with wholesome content, like it doesn't make sense. Just not for me. Wish you the best luck.
Lol I wonder if I knew da midwife..lol..I’d so than ungutes are where I am….. l´who knows… will see…. Wishing you a marginal journey of birth…. My homebirthed daughter is now 12.
wish you all the best and for baby as well i hope the bear's dont wreck your place while your gone  are you coming back to it at all ???
7 months PG, how did this happen?  Your pruning is way off.  Your funk sway is off.  I will steal your chi and your wife, ha, ha, ha.  Just kidding, you guys are great.  Focus on love, all things are possible.  Screw the snow!!!
A baby is a blessing from Almighty God
♥️
Nicolle got it exactly right, rock scallops are really good. I really love watching their channel.
Why can’t you come back ? Your child deserve this beautiful natural life too , after your child birth please come back to this wonderful living condition again. Good luck and best wishes.
Looks like a girl. Beautiful as momma
Good luck with everything. I believe it's a boy! ✌😊
Your video's used to be so good , but OMG now you waste so much of the video talking shit and Ying & Yang !whats happened to you guy"s is mental health in the wilderness become an issue?
While living off the grid is cool, how exactly is recording everything considered off the grid?
Awesome under water recording, it was beautiful and a little intense, no matter what you chose to do in life, if your sharing I’ll be there to support.
THIS CHANNEL IS ALL ABOUT SHOWING SKIN ,... to get viewers ...( the girl ) naked ... Shame on you ...
Boa noite muito legal esse casal muito simpático vivendo na floresta nossa que interessante como eles vivem uma vida muito boa melhor que está na cidade.Amei vcs parabéns pelo trabalho de compartilhar com nós,me deu uma vontade de viver assim na floresta.Deud os abençoe e esse anjo que vem vindo um lindo bebê 🙏🙏🙏😘
I hope after all the hard work you both have done.  That you won't go back to the homeland when you're daughter is old enough for school.  You know that you can always ask your followers to send you school books this way you can continue to live free and wild
I pray God leads & blesses you both & your precious baby♥️🕊♥️I pray you find the joy in the journey near or far from your oasis. Do not allow fear to speak louder than the moment your living in. Perfect love casts out all fear. God’s love is perfect. You will come back in season! Bless you & keep you♥️🕊♥️
It was a good run!  Looking forward to the new digs
Looking forward to that great "Tropical Adventure"!
My wife had me rub cocoa butter on her belly, it was supposed to limit skin stretching. I’m not sure if it helped much. But it was enjoyable for her.
Eu curto muito os vídeos de vcs
Do you guys eat fish if you do you are not a true vegan vegan do not eat fish
You guys are AWESOME ! Best of luck and look forward seeing your new adventures ! Every time I watch your videos I get inspired to film so hurry back because I might get lazy !
És mennyi élő fát kivágtáll, hogy úgymond  "hogy zöld életet" élhess ha ennyi, kelll,  akkor valami nagyon nagy gond van ebben a világban.
🤢
cant wait to see the footage in the TROPICS!
The filming underwater reminded me of the cold water off Cape Town & the documentary, "My Octopus Teacher, so good, keep safe both of you. Best wishes for the coming months.
IT'S A BOYYY
oy vey!
But, your baby is more important then your garden. It will be there when you return. You need to have your baby close to hospital. Trent and Allie built house in the woods and had baby. Even they were close to the  hospital, they had issues with the BABY'S  BIRTH.
Congratulations friends, hopefully healthy always for the prospective baby inside and also the mother, it looks like the baby is a woman
Happy New Year and all the best to your growing family. Very impressed with the two of you.
Im so excited for you two a new baby❤❤❤❤ and a new journey hopefully soon you'll return back and this time with your bundle joy💞 good luck to you both!!

Love your channel. Keep sharing your journey, it’s powerful and inspirational. Blessings.
Jake and Nicole, Are you going to have someone look after your place while you’re gone? I hope so. You guys have built a beautiful place there. So peaceful and calming. You’ll need that and this baby will need that to grow up to be a wonderful person. Be well be safe and come back to us soon.
Are you going to  have someone checking on you place while you are gone ? It is so beautiful💕
That kid grew day by day eating what grew from its soil, you would be back soon if not your kid will make you.!
Komorebi is just one of your many destinations. Fear not of losing it, but rather be grateful for the time you've had - Past, present, and future.
Is this the same girl who always showed her body during the intro of their videos???
lol - those first few moments with Nicolle's tummy dancing were hilarious... I remember that!
Your not leaving it behind. You can't fool me.
I think something's not quite right with you definitely a different type of character
Spaghetti Itailan food...ciaooooo
Why??????
Слишком личные вещи показываете. Так нельзя.
Hahahahaha what a farce❗️🤣 This is nothing but paid, scripted, Freemasonic actors 🤡 🤣 ✌️🤘👌 ☯️
thank you for being on you tube  and keep going
I bet you will find far more satisfaction in fatherhood that you could anywhere else in life to include this property. I know I did. It changed all of my priorities and gave me a renewed meaning and focus. I hope that will be your path too. Come back when your ready and able.
Hey guys, my name is Mario. Thank you for sharing your adventures with us. You guys are really good at Vlogging. Its pretty amazing to watch you guys in your off grid life story. The forest you live in is pretty amazing! I was just curious if you own the land and how big it is because owning that type of land is magical in my mind. I also want to say congratulations on your new baby. I just started watching about a month or so ago so I am sure you've had your baby some time now. Jake you seem like my kind of dude! One that can take care of himself and his family and not the no nothing, entitled brat kid like dude that can't even support himself, let alone a family. I appreciate your skill and know how. Nicolle you are beautiful and sweet and a perfect match for Jake. You are a very tough and resilient individual too so I commend you and applaud you both. You are a couple of bad asses! I hope this adventure lasts a lifetime for you if its what you want. I wish you both the best in health and safety. You have sparked my interest into traveling to Alaska to see the wonders with my wife Kari. Keep up the good work and I will keep checking it out because it's pretty amazing. I am sure it has its challenging moments, but life in general does anyway so why not have it be there. I hope you guys had a wonderful holiday season and a happy New Year. Take care and thanks again for sharing.
Q bonita 😍 pancita
I think he is not ready
Boy!
Ps if If I am right can I and someone come to take care of your land for you till yall GET BACK.. Bc y'all be back js.
Holy cow! I stopped watching awhile back really for no reason I love the channel but damn have things changed....wow...good luck to you all...God bless and Godspeed
Its a boy
My dad introduced me to your channel - he was killed last year during a home invasion. Watching your intro and thoughts around leaving, once again brought up the reality of that death and the end and starting of new seasons. Life is complicated, choosing to dwell on the chaos instead of the opportunity of a new season can be dangerous. Wishing you all the best in your new season
Hopefully the Bears will remain in hibernation, while there are no dogs & folks at home.
wishing you the best for the delivery of your little <3 i have loved following your journey and don't miss a video. and uh hello tropical location?!? i am excited for the next video lol
This channel is the king of click bait thumbnails
OMG Nicole you must be the first woman to be pregnant ever as you know everything! Clearly everybody needs your advice!
stop chopping wood without protective goggles!
I thought you guys were great in earlier days but you're just about the money now and I will follow you no more!
Thanks for everything....I wish only the best for your family and hope that you end up back in this beautiful place that you put all of this work in....I have applied some of the things you have done to my small town in the flat lands (KANSAS)....GOOD LUCK TO YOU....
Love hearing more from you guys, the videos that are mostly just visuals are beautiful but I definitely prefer ones like these, reminds me of the beginning of the channel when you first started the build 💛 Looking forward to hear more about the new property!
We wish you a beautiful and healthy baby We wish the mother an easy birth and a healthy life.. Thank you for the videos of the life that we see among nature.
Best wishes for your future. I hope you can return. Jake  you have put in such an incredible effort creating  your garden of  Eden  : New  life brings new changes and choices. Hugs
This is one of the fakest people who are on YouTube 🤣
You don't have to clickbait us with your boobs to watch your videos ,please stop doing it
Off grid using a lot of On grid things. Lol
Happy New Year! Take care and please, please come back. You Both are such an inspiration 💛💗 Blessings with giving birth; an amazing experience, you'll see.
Hello from Greece I'm glad to see you Happy New Year
Як ты, даражэнькая, як плод?
All the best!!!    See you soon!!!
minute 29:19 of the video, why don't you take advantage of the logs on the ground?
Happy New Year 🎆 🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆
I made that last comment before I saw the end of the video and sure enough that's exactly what you guys did great  Minds think alike much blessings on your journey.
Hold on to that garden and it will be waiting there for you to pick up and grow again.  Wishing Nicole a safe delivery. I have enjoyed your videos and they are very educational. Take care till the next one.
😘😘😘😘😘👪👪👪👪👪☝❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💓💓💓💓💓💓💓 خیلی خیلی تبریک  میگم  قدم نو  رسیده  تون مبارک ....دوستون دارم
We will miss you 😢 but I understand be safe and my prayers 🙏✝️🙏🕊💫
Maybe you guys should’ve eased up on  booty calls.  Either way I love the videos I hope you all the best.
Don't be so dramatic go back with your family have the baby Visit and have fun and return to keep it going. Or rent it out by another property and have 2 properties to go back-and-forth too.
Kinda sad people have to use thumbnails like that to attract people.
Not so 'off grid' when you broadcast yourself online and have 1.15M subscribers..
Much peace and love from north central Illinois! ✌👍
Hey Guys!! Your videos are really inspiring. I always look forward to the weekly spiralling down by Jake into uncertainty and unstableness. You do make me laugh when you start narrating; will continue to watch on here as I can't afford the Onlyfans subscription and as you only get to see a small part of Jake in the other platforms, it's just not worth the $$.  P.S. Loose jean jackets are NOT chainsaw safe.  Keep up the good work😉
Allah analı babalı büyüsün şansı açık Zihni profesör doktor aklı olsun tebrik ediyorum sizleri.✌️♥️✌️
i hate to break it to you but you're not off the grid if you're on the internet.
Смотрю вас как увлекательный сериал. С нетерпением жду каждую серию. Спасибо.
I really wish I could get to meet you guys but I doubt that I will. My wife and I watch all your videos. I live near Battle Creek, Michigan my name is Denny God bless you and the one to be born soon.
Hey you guys Letting Go IS a season of life. If you don't practice that you're denying full life. Letting go brings a new season a new thing to recieve because you have open arms. The earth a garden a lnew life they are always here.  The earth is to big to make such a garden your only life. You lost one garden and gained a new bigger one and in that you noursihed 2 lives to the point of growing another. Great Job you 2 ENJOY !!!!
Onlyfans content is on point.
Once you have the baby you won’t have time to tend to the garden your whole attitude will change
That side shot of her breast, just for views  - disgusting!
Baby needs a sibling. More children is a must. Life has no real purpose without kids. Best wishes to you both.
Why is the video so damn bright ? lol
😃😃😃😃😃😃
🙃😏
Lovely couple always keepsafe im soo excited your baby coming up of the real world with a nice nature. God bless
I love seeing how he takes care of his wife.  Happy New Year to all of you with good health ❤️🎆🌹🎁💕🥂
Oh dear , well if you are planning on leaving please be sure to dismantle everything  and remove it all and  replant all you have taken out , because if you do not return it to how you found it well that will be another man made scar in nature from a failed human project, prove us wrong and stick to what you started , our ancient ancestors never had a built up city to run off to because they were worried about a child being born , we thought that was the idea of what you were trying to achieve living a natural life .PS IF YOUR PLANNING ON NOT RETURNING DO NOT REMOVE ANOTHER TREE .🌲
Soo nice place ....
:(
Is this sea foraging you're doing legall? A lot of folks get arrested for it in BC.  So sad to see the kelp forests disappearing for the sea doggos.
I want to thank you (Gilakas’la) for the 3 years you have given us and taught us so many things at Komo Revy. (I may have spelled it wrong , I apologise.) I feel for Jake, for I have really understood the importance of having living off the land taken from me at birth. I'm a Sixties Scoop survivor and have missed most of my inherited life as a First Nation from the Kwakwaka'wakw band, I'm Kwakiutl. I'm excited for you both and the arrival of your baby. One thing you both have I spired me to travel at the age of 55!  Please don't totally disappear we all love your vlogs here on YouTube.
Started following you years ago when you were in Arizona with your Longevity Garden-I  wanted to learn about gardening-low and behold you came to the best country in the world! (ok I'm biased).
Love you guys  you place so beautiful and I love to watch your  journey thank to share us.
Cool!
🖐👍🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
Someone should report these people. I tried but you have to use a computer and I only have an android.  Read the ☝ Community Guidelines. They are in violation.
Let me answer your question Nicholle. How was my holiday? Here goes. My brother..one year younger than me, died on 12/11 3 weeks after he was diagnosed with cancer. THEN I found out my favorite YouTubers..being you and Fake. I mean Jake..where I found a great distraction from my life and truly bought into your bullshit..are in reality nasty porn stars. Thanks for asking. I would throw up if you told the truth about your holidays..huh.  Sorry. I am so angry because I hate when someone plays me and makes me feel stupid. I will pray for you and the baby.🙏🙏🙏✌✌✌
You can do whatever you want.... but wow I feel like you’ve jipped us the viewers and dreamers. How amazing the rainforest is and how anyone can do this off grid thing anywhere..... but now you say the tropics are better.  Maybe Im not understanding this video.... we’ll see what happens next week then.
Oh gee wiz jake, it’s just another part of your dream. If having this home is truly your dream, you will be back. It’s beautiful. Just another step in your dream. A family.
I can’t wait to see the new journey !!! Jake is going to do some great construction on this land I can already tell it’s a great set up! Nicolle my wife is so happy for you and she really hopes you get some chickens out there for eggs and meat ! Congrats on the baby and we’re wishing you guys the best on whats to come in the future
Beautiful video  Like I feel like I learned from it  Take that for the compliment it is!
Stay tuned next week for the Adventure....
Your thumb nails need to change for for anyone I know will ever watch your content
I say it is a boy. I just have a feeling fingers crossed 🤞
What did you do about the dogs and the cats?
Another magical video, undersea world was brilliant thanks Jake for sharing, Wow wow Nicole you are glowing more now than ever, your hair is just so gorgeous. Mmm the end is a twist, please don't stay away more than unnessary. That's where you belong unless you really are in an tropical paradise dream. Take care & best wishes on this last stage with bubby. Many blessings Jake & Nicole 💚🙏🙏
what's that clear looking thing you were following under the water. that was kool
Right Move
hai, i'am from Indonesia. I hope your baby is healthy and brings happiness to you
на  твёрдую - 4 - видео and - MUZIKA
Only true fear should be of not doing what’s best for your family. You’ll return, and return soon. Your soul, and families souls need it.
take care an have a great trip to and from where you are going
Much better… let’s go, tropics.
The uncertainty of life is the adventure. God Bless you both and your unborn child
He just cannot be happy unless he’s doing the damn most. 😣 Girl, I don’t know how you deal with him.  Dogs and pregnant woman FREEZING 🥶 because he just NEEDS to take a swim. Annoying.
I think this is a wise decision . So glad you are thinking about your child and you will see when he /she comes out  it will be magical . You will be awesome parents wherever you are . Lucky kid 🙂🙏☮☯🕉❤
Our pregnancy, your pregnancy.
Clickbait thumbnails have come and gone but this one is a wtf for sure.
Good luck with that birthing complication.
New angers! Spare me!
Awww, he’s trying not to cry, how @#$&^% weak.
Disrespectful and embarrassing pic for a thumbnial.
This is gross, thanks lefties.
I have so enjoyed watching the both of you.  The baby will come first and maybe you can come back when the baby is older. I hope we get to share in seeing the beautiful baby you and Nicole will bring into this world. I wish you both the best this earth has to offer.
You are so in inspirational your heart is the wild live wild you eat wild and your Nextep is your new beginning always remember the wild always provides
Lol love it Tropical bug out property. Happy healthy birth.
It's been awhile since I've checked in on you two ... Well three now lol.  Mama is definitely pregnant now ... Loved seeing the baby move! Hopefully you've worked out a birth plan that works for you and your needs! It's crazy to see how far you've come from where it all started.  Be safe up there in the snowy snow
If you leave will it become free to another person who stumbles upon it?
If the jellyfish, seal, and fresh off the coral scallop dinner was a precursor to what's ahead, then I'm stoked for you both. 🌊🌴☀️
Hi guys Shawn &Deb from Pender Harbour BC.We really enjoy you both thanks. Where are the dogs &cat staying for the time .Everything will work out for you two you have alot of support and you are intelligent people.
D0 you guys have an only fans?
Liking the narrative
Now I understand the sailing lessons!  I am so excited for you both!  I can’t wait to see what you are doing.
Nicole, you can still stir in some essential oils into your lotion. Look up Rosemary Gladstar books on making he real butters and remedies. That is if you haven’t already done so.
It's a little sad that they're leaving I know they didn't want to disturb the land too much but I was in hoping that they would have builded a house. Peace and blessings in whatever they decide to do next in life, have a happy and safe birth and may you find your way back to your land or Homestead peace and blessings.👍
I love the only fans Jake & Nicole! Are y’all going to be making any content while pregnant or with the kid?
REALLY???   I can understand the logic BUT leave it all behind?   Sell it?   You just added the smoker, the craft/guest room???   Just walking away????
كل هذه الطبيعة ستزول وتنتهي حتماً ستبقى سوى الذكريات فقط
Clearly, Jake is getting his period.
Why were you okay with that thumbnail??? Please change it. That shirt your wife is wearing NEEDS a bra... 😑
: /    Yeahh about that opening "speech"?  YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT JAKE! ( im sure your name isnt even Jake!  you almost had me fooled! ( and you and "nicole".  If that is even her name (  and no! Rocky is not my name )  But i never say it is!   Life is not about yin and yang, you wang!   This life is a test!  an individual test for all of us, individually, and collectively to a degree too.   Life is a gift from God our father and creator!   Im not going to get into this all again with you jake and nicole.   You both are opposites and  you are probably not even the father of this child either!  : /   Yeahh, i said it!   You both have been very clever and putting on a great show and act, and MAKING A TON OF MONEY THROUGH IT ALL!  AND THAT IS INFACT WHAT ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT!  I SAW THAT A LONG TIME AGO!  AND TOLD YOU BOTH ABOUT IT TOO!  DECEPTION IS EVIL!  AND YOU BOTH ARE DECEIVERS!  THE TRUTH IS OUT NOW.  YOU SHOULD JUST BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME WITH THIS CHARADE!  HEY EVERYONE!  DO SOME RESEARCH AND TRACE BACK TO ALL OF "JAKES" VIDEOS!  FROM YEARS AGO!  WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE EVERYONE HE WAS A WHITE SHAOLIN MONK SIFU TEACHING KUNG FU AND FORTUNE COOKIE RIDDLES TO EVERYONE!   : /   lol..  AND HE WAS USING A DIFFERENT NAME IN SOME OF HIS OTHER VIDEOS..   FRAUD!
wait, what?!! omg. 💜💜💜
ahhhh so exciting! You made it woohooooo so stoked for the next video!! Do we get to see a Christmas and New Years video? ;P
Brother man please do not use body elbow..as a hammer.. trust me..sending ❤
Wishing you guys the best of luck on your journeys and praying for the healthy birth of your little Pearl. Can't wait to see what comes next for you! Be safe, stay healthy and happy New Year!!
So glad to have been able to follow you for the last 3 years. Has been an interesting journey. Wishing you a Happy New Year and the best to you both and your soon to be new addition. What ever and wherever the future takes you I wish you God's richest blessings.
Sooooo.... Tropical... Sailing to it... Hawaii?
what a pitty, i look at jou now, and miss you already.
an emotional ending but an even more exciting future!
.....Aww shucks guys, it was kinda like having to sell my fav motorbike when I watched you leave Komorebi. And preservation of life and wanting warmer  climes I can see why you needed a change of scenery. Please don't leave us all behind now we have this connection, one much like Jake has with Komorebi. life is full of surprizes, and when baby Jake is born you will get another surprize. All the best for 2022 to the best damn team around.
Hi greetings from Aruba🌴👋

Gross
😊💖🐶🐶🙏
We will miss you but this time will go by quickly and you are doing the right thing. TRUST ME AND YOU WILL BE BCK
You're "off-grid" and yet you have a smart phone and make YouTube videos.   smh
Do you have a midwife lined up? Or is your husband delivering the baby?
ARE YOU LEAVING THIS PLACE?  OOOH IT IS SO HARD TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PLACE. I FEEL NOSTALGIC FOR YOU.
Milk Maid   Yum
Imagine what you could do with a nice four-wheel drive four-wheeler small trailer out there
7 months pregnant?? Giiiirl you don't look a day over 12 months pregnant!
Happy New Year !!!!  🥰🥰🥳🥳😘😘
Ok, so what is going to happen with this property.  Do you have someone to manage it?  Are you selling?  I live in Vancouver and have been searching for a place to live off the grid.  I've been following you for about 2 years.  I love what you have done especially with the garden.  I've been growing my own garden in the city for about 12 years now.  It's my obsession.  Do you need someone to take care of the garden and the property because I can be there in a day.
Amazing.. As always.  I hope there's a golf course nearby...
The thumbnail is absolutely top class.
🐰🎅🏻🎄☃️🎁🐰 Nicolle, do you like marshmallow peeps? They sell them almost everywhere around Easter & Christmas. They have different shapes and colors. I love the blue marshmallow blue bunny’s the best. If you haven’t ever ate them, well I say to you, try them you’ll love them.🐰🎅🏻🎄☃️🎁🐰
You guys are fucking amazing. Great story fucking story. Bravo!
Unfounded fear about your place-take care of your wife…the rest is replaceable…
Ps, I posted my last comment before I got to the end of the video. I hope you guys chose Hawaii lol
Did ya leave and abandoned everything?!!! 🤯.. are ya ever going back ? .. so shocked !! Happy new year , good luck on your trimester..
you are the perfect kite I wish you all the best of this world
Hello sensei jake I’ve been following you since iron body, this is my gfs profile and we have been watching you two since the beginning. Please don’t give up, you still inspire me and you two during this adventure have inspired me and my gf to do this but in Hawaii big island. Sensei jake you have impacted me so much I followed your iron training and I was able to hammer fist coconuts in half. You will always be my sensei from afar. I don’t just click on your videos for the clickbait lol. Wishing you guys the best on your journey.
I don’t know if I’m allowed to say where y’all are. Best of luck in the next 6 months. I know I’m excited to see what’s coming.
Štastný nový rok 2022 Jste úžasní 💯
Dude!  Congrats on that pasta!  You must have some Italian in you!
Thanks!
Crazy. Wasn’t expecting that. But is the grass greener else where plus more work? Trade the cooler weather in winter, bugs in the summer for tropical storms, heat stroke, etc… to each their own I guess. Still can’t wait to see the future for you guys. Life goes on. I always want hotter. -48°c this winter for a long spell. No thanks. Take care
I have really enjoyed your video adventure carving out you place in the wild. The feel good interpersonal philosophies are based more on emotions than facts. A wise man once wrote "the heart is treacherous who can know it". Clearly thought out are more desirable when not overly influenced by personal desire. Our actions that recognize our families need for stability and consistency of surroundings and recognition of our creator  is the inner voice of maturity and wisdom that many seek.  “Gray-Headedness (maturity) is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way or righteousness."
Great video Jake and Nicolle
GREAT JOBS YOU TWO.......GOD BLESS YOU AND ALL YOUR FAMILIES....ENJOY YOUR WORK......BLESSINGS.
This was pure cinematic tranquility, amazing story telling, amazing shots and scenes and an amazing life to follow.
Einfach wunderbar wie ihr euer Leben lebt, wie ihr euch auf das Baby vorbereitet und freut, wie ihr miteinander umgeht. Ich bewundere euch. Haltet dieses Leben so fest wie ihr nur könnt und bleibt glücklich. Wenn euer Baby erst da ist werdet ihr noch glücklicher sein. Kommt gut in das neue Jahr 2022 und lasst euch grüßen aus Germany...Reinhold 🎄🎆👨‍👩‍👦
I hope that all of you out there searching for meaningful things receive them this new year! Happy New Year 💙
Where is your other cat?
Atlar inekler keçiler tavuklar hindiler kazlar
I'm down for taking care of it all. Lol
I'll be a landlord
the bible says=="do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow shall take care of itsself" let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid......rest in the Lord and lean not to thine own understanding.  God bless.

OMG those scallops are massive!
Squirrel!
"Free of oil and gas..."   Surely there were no hydrocarbons used in moving them across at least one hemisphere. How about 2-cycle chainsaws?
Witajcie!! Podziwiam Was bardzo ..Piękne widoki, przyroda, z pogodą jest różnie...  Ponieważ nie znam angielskiego pisze po polsku. Powiedzcie mi  gdzie jest to miejsce gdzie żyjecie i jakiej rasy są wasze psy...sa super. Pozdrowienia dla was troje!!! Włodek .
EWWWWW, CRINGY,WEIRD,GROSS THUMBNAIL LOL
You can get someone to take care of the property while you are both gone. Sure they won't take care of it like you would, but it will still be active and available to you your new baby and Nicole. It is the perfect place to raise a family. You and Nicole have put in too much sweat and work to let this natural occurrence stop your dream of this paradise you  and Nicole have created. The new baby will appreciate this paradise more and more as he or she grows in the future years. The paradise which is Covid 19 free, will stay that way with you and your new arrival. You have no choice but to return to this paradise once the blessed event takes place. Good luck in your future, and don't give up on things that you and Nicole have worked so hard for.
Happy new year xx xx xx. Keep safe .and see you soon. Baby bump  be gentle.
🥰😘
He is a sickening show off
Not gonna lie the thumb nail gripped me and reminded me of the pure pleasure of being with my pregnant wife when everything was swollen so pleasurably and erotically. It astonishing that some men dont like their pregnant womens bodys. That being said I found spiritual enlightenment when I sought physical excitement. Thank you and enjoy the running of milk down the breasts when you make love. You may never see it again, or see your women so horney lol okay Im done 😃
The intro 😂🤦🏾‍♂️ for a first timer it was a first that’s fasho
Username sounds like the YouTube channel Off Grid with Doug and Stacy
What did you do with the kitties and the doggies?
So are you going to be nomads with no roots?
I think you too should turn that place into a sanctuary that others can visit and stay for a fee. You can come out for ling weekends and host seminars on how to plant, build, scavenge, brew herbal teas, forage, fish and survive in the wild. Meanwhile you can have a place to live in a small city or the country, close to a hospital, etc. The best of both worlds.
No! You cant do this! My vicarious life is coming to an end????
There could be snorkeling scuba diving you can cut a canoe out of a tree there's just so much fish you can get on an island
Oh God please tell me you're going to do what you're doing on an island in the tropics please please
https://youtu.be/xz4C2jOdzbU
Damn snow, split pea lentil soup would be on my mind
We are waiting to see your lovely healthy baby 🎉🎈❤️
This life in the beautiful, charming nature in winter and summer despite the difficulties and troubles, but it is a real good life, where you enjoy the healthy atmosphere, clean air, and delicious food that is always fresh and delicious than living in luxurious palaces and the noise of noisy cities and polluted atmosphere❤️🌹🌺☃️🌺👍🌹❤️
Where is the second dog?  Did something happen?
I can now understand why Jake is nervous about not coming back!! Lol going to the tropics.....who would wanna leave paradise?!? Lol although y'all did kinda make your own paradise ......
Happy Near Year you Two!! Hey Jake, With all those Seals and Killer Whales around I would be a little worried that you look like a Meal to the wales in that Black wet suit. What is the RED stuff in those clams or mussels ?
Wow, very ambitious. Good stuff. Only thing on this planet that is as good as the forests are the oceans. Thought this channel peaked...I was wrong....stay safe.....
Off grid, but yall on the internet. The irony.
Now they have milked out their subs to the brim, they leave their glamping area😂😂😂
Wow
Suspense so excited for u both an happy new year guys
I thought y'all were vegans?
what? You guys are moving. So many changes. good luck.
Jake & Nicolle need to share their secret teleportation technology,  solar powered of course!
Jake & Nicolle, It's your privacies and both, your decisions to keep it private the pregnancies and you will hopefully come back to  KOMOREBI, I understand how things in life can change without any notice or realizing the whole picture. I see that a lot is going through your mind and emotion, Jake. I had plans at a young age, now I am 66 years of age and never married.
Why is it that every effing offgrid couple or solo female has to play on sex? Seriously, do awesome videos and leave the other things to Pornhub or Onlyfans.
Dear YouTube, why would you recommend this to ME?!
I am only about 5 min into your video and feel so compelled to express a couple things if I may... First; I totally feel Jake in his expression of his feelings at this point. A responsible husband and father will natural want to make every effort to provide what he believes his family needs. His conflict is valid. But he knows this already. If it helps; I commend and support anyone's decision to have a home birth. I don't know when a childbirth became a hospital emergency by itself for society, but birthing a child is not an emergency. Society has trained people to feel like they can't do it without the help of the medical industry. This is false and promotes  incapability. I know this for a few reasons. I'll mention that I have worked at a hospital for a good number of years, but also I have twice now participated in my own children's birth, at home. I've seen plenty of births at the hospital and in my experience, a byproduct of societies' exchange of home births for hospital births is that the father is often completely left out of the experience. The father's role has become nothing more than either financial alone, or a "hand holder" at best. But mostly inconsequential, when it comes to the actual childbirth... This breaks my heart for father's. Father's have a drive to help installed in their DNA. We're problem solvers. When it comes to childbirth, one of the most significant moments in a father's life, in this society, men/father's are left out. I also cannot measure the impact this may have on his children... This society won't reach out to father's and provide them this information and I had to earn mine. If more father's took some time to learn about what they can do and how they can be useful for childbirth, including providing counter pressure during contractions, the stages of birth and what can be expected from the mother during times like the "transition period" etc., more father's would be far more involved, attached, and invested in the experience and therefore far more rewarded... It is work. Very involved both physically and emotionally. To push on your wife's hips while you know she's in pain and crying, telling  you that she needs help and can't do this anymore and you have to navigate this and figure it all out... The accomplishment in this regard is unimaginable for father's who have never done it. This who have hold these experiences close. Don't get me wrong, fatherhood in any respect can be very rewarding. But if I could say anything to all expecting father's it would be this, and that you are far more valuable and needed than you, your wife, and society knows, tells you, and gives you credit for. There is far more you can do to benefit your wife, your children and yourself in this experience of you want it. Having done it, and hearing you express your feelings, I believe you both want it. Don't let fear guide you. It's difficult when it comes to the safety of your wife and children, I know. You're going to feel a kind of anxiety that you probably haven't felt before, but just know that a woman's body is amazing and does what it needs to do naturally and you as a father are needed and can be such a valuable help in this process. Childbirth is not an emergency. Having a trained midwife is a great thing. Learn all you can about their experiences and what they've seen others do that are helpful.  Anyway, sorry for the long comment and I hope it not only makes sense but that I've been able to express the message that maybe you've needed. Maybe I'm being pretentious and if so, a apologize, that's not my intention. Maybe when this is complete for you, you'll feel the same way about trying to help other father's...  Reach out if you have questions or if things I've said need clarity - I'm sure you have plenty of ppl around you that are willing to help. Just know that I guess, I'm another one and would gladly help how I can. What a fantastic opportunity you both have and I'm excited for you both!
A garden will grow again, but you only have one chance for a safe birth. I haven't watched for a while, but geez the first 5 mins had me stressed. Lol forward to your baby, then the garden.
Wow, nice video!!! Super nice to see you grow Nicole. Tears are in my eyes. Jake, how are you man? Take care and play it on safe!!! So important!! Sorry for my english
Jake, you're the most extroverted introvert I've ever seen. I think that you are your own Ying and Yang. I don't think that there will be many people who have been watching your channel buy into your philosophy.
10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners  1. I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian.   2. IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you have got. 3. He who laughs last thinks slowest. 4. They told me I was gullible...and I believed them. 5. A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory. 6. The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.  7. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home.  8. If ignorance is bliss, then tourists are in a constant state of euphoria. 9. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back.   10. I've had amnesia as long as I can remember.   Editorial: It could be that the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Better buy another property closer than the current one if you're afraid of losing it..then good for you-new project means new content for youtube...!! The main thing is that your current place is not accesible by road, let alone the many miles away !!
Quit being dramatic.  You’ll be fine.
Why dont you rent an excavator and level your front house/garden...it'll look nice to see and better living for you guys...i really wish you wud ..also it'll be so fun watching even if its 2 hours long..
Jake gli spaghetti te li mando io dall Italia ,ciao
Happy New Year 2022. May God shed his blessing on the three of you
FANTASTIC VIDEO, thank you , from Spain, Happy New year
Who gonna talk about the clickbait pic
You guys are amazing, this video was so unexpected. What a cliffhanger! I cannot wait to see what the future brings for your family.
beautiful <3 please be careful with drinking raspberry leaves in later pregnancy because it can induce birth :)
I don’t get it. Compared to the rest of us, you live in a Garden of Eden. Forget the new age B.S. stay where you are and raise your child in that Paradise.
The jellyfish is magical. The garden and trees have inspired me to grow more.  I hope all goes well for the arrival of your baby. And  look forward to you coming back to your gardens.
Feliz-Happy...Año...Nuevo-New 2022 Amigos-Friends...
tanti cari auguri,Nicole,bravi
Nicole,  watching your baby move brought back precious memories of when I was pregnant ( both times) ...... there is no greater feelings than what a woman can feel during pregnancy and giving birth....  p.s. it looks to me that you are having a boy.... you are carrying the baby low ..... lol Angel Davis Acworth Georgia
Parabéns pelo estilo de VIDA 👏👏👏🙏
The theatrics are unreal
that's cool, but imma hold off till the apocalypse. i got video games to play
Happy new year and the best for your baby I was a nice Movie Great von Kolon Germany Josef and Angelika and the Lorry Fatu Hiva
Wow, Jake. Way to make it all about you. Your partner is about to give birth and you're whining about your garden.
Sorry love your content but your thumbnails.... everytime guys stop selling your wife....yes I know you doing it for clickbait... but golly you going to be a mother...what are you promoting... unsubscribed
I know that feeling man when I was younger I had my own food forest in mesa and I got evicted it felt like a part of me was ripped a part  I was 13 and loved your garden I watched all your videos I wanted to go to your tours but never could make it thank you for introducing me to food forestry
I just hope i haven't become invested these last 4 years watching these guys travel researching the world of low impact living and veganism culture and then settle as low impact vegans to get burnt once again....EG: Freelee and Durian rider style, Just a huge idealistic sinchole for me to plummet down to realise it was all a huge cash in con....(expensive japanese cutlery anyone)? not to mention the home made porn they've been making and posting online...etc etc.. Durian riders clean drug free lifestyle, genuine internet relationships...etc..   How much more gullible can youtube epect me to be....pissed off dissalusioned.....2022 no more getting fished in... like vegan salmon...lol
Please, come back 😢
Great video Guys!! One of your best! Very much looking forward to the next video! Great suspense at the end! You WILL obviously miss the extraordinary one of a kind wildlife nature where you are BUT How amazing to be able to experience something warmer different and have that experience aswell!! Just AMAZING!  Absolutely love you guys!!  Happy New Year! Here's to a MUCH BETTER 2022! For you and EVERYONE! And here's to a Lucky little Lad or Lady to add to your family!  Sending Love Best wishes Good Luck and positive energy from London England Happy New Year! 👍❤️💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😎🙏🕉️ x
🇩🇰🇩🇰+🇩🇰
Good one on the ending!
If that's your choice, it's right!
I have faith that you will prosper. Make changes. Fight your current fears. Your videos feed my soul and your life makes me dream bigger. There is a reason you keep losing. Listen to your internal answers and bare the arms to fashion a more sustainable year, life, family ahead of you. Your baby will empower you more than you could ever imagine you will become more the man you already are and Nicola the wiser caring mother. You are strong enough to overcome any obstacles you haven’t already faced with different meanings. Love.Health.Happiness🌎❤️
click bait much
Hi Nicolle and Jake! I've been watching your videos for a while now and really love following your off grid journey. I am a doula and birthworker in Upstate NY. I know you probably know, it seems like you have a wonderful midwife and you've been doing so much research on your own, but I couldn't help but mention it - itching in the third trimester can sometimes mean simply that your skin is stretching out and accommodating the baby like you mentioned. I would keep an eye on that and maybe log how often you feel itchy because it can also indicate a liver condition, cholestasis. Like I mentioned, it's usually just stretching of the skin but I would definitely let your midwife know, if you haven't already, and keep an eye on it.   Sending love and and healthy vibes to you for your upcoming labor and delivery! I know it will be everything you imagined and more! ❤
Omg I’m so excited for your next video!!! Congratulations to both of you for your baby! He or she is finally here!!! WOW that’s amazing and I can’t wait to see where you guys are living now!! ❤️❤️❤️ Happy New Year!
Like from Far East (Russia) ✌️
Awwww congratulations.
...Too much "Yong"....    And because "isolation" involves passing headlights. Can't be that out of the way if theres traffic.
Oh, wow!
who pissed in your cereal?
I’ve had issues with this channel for a while, but have continued to watch just out of interest for their homesteading techniques. But there are many aspects of what they show that are disingenuous – ie where is the power coming from that charges their power tool batteries, cell phones, computers and camera batteries? The meagre amount of solar power they generate is not enough to power them, and seems to be there to power their bear/deer wildlife fence. Others have mentioned that they plug-in at a neighbour's house, which is not exactly off-grid. I wouldn’t be surprised if they have the use of a refrigerator there as well.  I originally caught onto Jake through the Handeeman channel, which (though he rarely posts now) is a far better and more purposeful off-grid information source. Handeeman eventually did connect to the grid when it became the only way to get reliable internet for his and his wife’s channels. He’s on a FIT program to make use of his surplus energy generation.  Jake often quotes various Chinese philosophies and ways of life to dictate his behaviours, but he cherry picks those that he talks about and doesn’t elaborate on those that don’t agree with his lifestyle. Jake is not alone in this – SE Asia is full of North American self-styled Shamen that portray themselves as enlightened while embracing only traditions and philosophies that suit them best. It is beyond hoaky, and a source of much derision in Asia.  More recently they did an about-face on their veganism and started adding seafood to their diet. No explanation, after years of espousing the benefits both health and environmental of the vegan diet, suddenly they were smoking fish. For the vegans that were devoted to the channel this was a slap in the face.  Others here have alluded to teaching institutes that have been announced but never happened, and more than once I’ve seen mention of a Karate school that people have enrolled in and received nothing. Jake is clearly a gifted athlete, and no doubt his surroundings in the Canadian rainforest have kept him away from his golf obsession.  The BC West Coast is quite hostile to year-round living, even on-grid. The winter months are constant rain or snow, the spring and half the summer bring a maddening amount of bugs. Late summer and fall are the nicest time of year, but are also the time that the growing season starts to go dormant.  I think that Jake set out to prove that one could grow a bounty of edible produce in adverse conditions here for the second time – the first being in Arizona. I admire his success in both places, though it does concern me that introducing non-native species may ultimately lead to some environmental issues down the road.  It also concerns me how much the main channel made such liberal use of Nicolle’s backside to bring in the views. That kind of soft porn seemed to be incongruous with the goals of the channel. Later on, I found that they were further monetizing this view on OnlyFans. I think this is shabby. Plus this channel commits two other bothersome sins – recycling content in long videos with no narrative to maximize superChats, and also way too many commercials.  They’ve worked hard and are doing extremely well. What the viewer sees is a couple making it “roughing it”. But a little research shows that they have amassed a small fortune putting out something that is at least somewhat a charade. There’s no arguing with their success, but I feel that if people knew the truth of it all they might turn their focus to other channels that are more forthright about what they are doing.
You are having a boy, how exciting, how do know this, I just do.you guys are awesome, continue the dream, your children will love you for it, God bless you both
It is beautiful to watch you and hear your thoughts on life and love.  Thank you for sharing...  it is a very special thing to be able to share yourselves and your hearts with all who chance upon on you!  2022.  May the stars and the sun watch over and protect you... continuing to share their secrets and wonder with you and your audience!  Forward on, over and under, a new dawn breaks and the heavens open wide as divinity is gifted into your care. Rejoice for no other day is as today and tomorrow has not yet been made.
Bom Dia quero conhecer este lugar .quando ñ tiver frio.
You have worked very hard too get this far!!  Don't let a few jittery doubts and fears get in the way of it all!!  You will regret it later!!  I have a dodgy house and its a high possibility of me moving!!  Not too keen myself!!  But come what may huh??  If in doubt...go and dance with the sea lions!!  LOL!!  Cheers!!
Hebrews 11 King James Version 11 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.  3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.  8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.  22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.  23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.  24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;  25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;  26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:  33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.  34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:  36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
Merry Christmas and 🥂 to a happy New Year!! In my opinion I'm at a point in my life where I think it's better to go back to the basics way of living, giving birth, homeschool, bringing your kids up in an environment where all the outside bs of the world doesn't seep in. Always keep in the top of your mind that communication is key. The little itty bitty stage will fly by fast!
There may be some heath issues/mental issues on both of them. There may be heath issues with the baby. Bringing up a child now days is a very hard task. I would never bring a child into this cruel world of drugs & Government corruption and all that's between. Our good days are in the past and you can't run away from it, you may postpone it a few weeks but it is going to catch up with everyone. God is Showing us He Is In Control. If I knew then what I know now... It will get worse as the scriptures tell you. Good Luck with it J&N  may the inner power be with you.
May your coming year be as good as your last one.
Wish you guys would start an off grid living school I would definitely pay tuition for some instruction under you two!
I'm watching us from turkey, don't leave you without a recycling video when you become your long-term baby
💓 We love you but so very sad, I know these are your lives and futures and you obviously have very good reason for doing what you're doing but it's still so very sad to see you leave your home at Komorebi and your lives that you've built there. My husband and I have so loved sharing in your lives there and love seeing you grow there it just breaks our hearts and I'm sorry, I don't want to make either of you feel badly about what you're having to do but we can just feel the heart break when we watch you leaving. We know as much as anyone who can only know someone from watching them on YouTube that this is very hard but very brave of you for doing all you have done and continue to do for each other and your new baby and Kai, Puma, Ginseng and Rishi. We can't wait to see you all happy and safe together soon! Congratulations on your new baby and your new home! But we do hope you're able to return to your wonderful and beautiful Komorebi that you've built so amazingly together! Thank you for sharing your lives! And we do wish you all the very best and happy and healthy lives together! 💗
I recall Jake saying that he could just shut off the camera and be done with making videos....I understand completely that yearning to make the break...do it while you can and enjoy the beautiful life you have created and going to create.
Congratulations on your continued adventure.....The Nature of things👁❤
Praying for your safety. Take care of yourself especially your baby. God bless
Jake is wack.
Remarkable, genius content,  remarkable lives.
You guy's actually seem very spoilt to me, you have everything only most people dream of. I ask you one question: have you ever known any hardship of any kind?.You don't know what it is to ...ah whatever. you think you know it all what do you know... bless you the blessed. God be with you I have enjoyed what you have shared. But don't think you know what is life its to learn and you are going to.
AWESOME!
You just have to look at what’s best for Nicole and the baby!! You had to have thought about something could happen that you two would need to go to the city to deliver the baby Healthy!!! Just honk how bad it could be if something happens to either one or both of them and if you didn’t go it costs one or both of they lives!!!! No one is saying you can’t return. By your actions it’s sounding like you two have problems with living out there and just don’t say anything on camera about it!! She’s having a baby!! Going to the city is apart of it. Being selfish Jake isn’t the way to be looking at it! It’s not as bad as you make it out to be. Hopefully Nicole and the Baby are healthy!!! Get over it and stop being so Dramatic and putting extra stress on Nicole!!!
It’s. Not all about you Jake get over your freaking gardens
As a Registered Nurse I don't know why you are so fearful. You remind me of all the people who believe in the Covid 19 bullshit. Research and understand the Truth. It's so sad you are making such a silly descision.
Good bye
Kaleigh and Jordan from The Nomadic Movement are down in Boguete if ya'll are in Costa Rica that's super close...Kaleigh just did a home water birth :) #thenomadicmovement
Such dramatism
19:10 Very happy to see a wife get food for her husband.  Meaningful.
I can't say my fears would be any less than yours in this moment but remember... sure you might lose some of the garden but everything you guys have built will be there waiting to welcome all 3 of you home.  What you guys have done here is unbelievable and that's not going to just disappear.
Showing the belly kicks reminded me of Dawn of the Dead when the lady gave birth to a zombie baby
what kind of diapers are you now use for the baby, cloth or disposable
That climate is to tough. Do the same thing in a better climate (less rain).As youve seen tberes money to be made. Your videos are great content and editing. Is good.
Is it me or was that all a bit melodramatic and a bit overly rehearsed?      LOL.  Still wish you all the best.
road to a mil 🚀 https://youtu.be/cx8LgTACaFg
The size of the belly indicates that you will have a son, this is from my personal practice.
I've watched you for a long time when you were in Arizona and you had a beautiful garden. I rember how much you traveled the world as I once did. Thank you both for sharing your experiences and gardening tips. God's speed and safe travel and return to you both. #lifeisbeautiful
Your videos are so beautiful happy new year and all the very best with the arrival of your baby 👶 coming soon 😘
If you are "off grid" how are you doing these vids?
Hi Jake and Nicolle hope all goes well with your next chapter and new family,  see you have the dogs  with you have you also got your cats?
Hi ..nice video friend ...come again ...happy new year ..
Most definitely the right decision. In this situation it will much safer to be near a urban area. I wish all the best to you and the baby. Happy New Year!!
Where can i download your background music’
Nicole ,& Jake God bless you ,and safety delivery.we expecting you on spiring with child.

Sun light does not CHARGE wood up to burn hotter...There is no mystical shit going on!
What a surprise ending!  I aspire to have your ambition and free spirits.
Feliz ano Novo muita paz e saúde para vocês
Most beautiful scene I’ve seen is when Jake runs into the birds. Fantastic!
Hallo how are you  I like your all video  you are so beautiful 😘😍💖💗💕❤
I can't wait till the baby is here so I can finish what I'm making to send you Nicole and Jake
No Jake be brave , it is your dream, they say before enligthment  chop some wood cary water, after enligthment cop some wood car water. Peace to you .
You inspired us to live a more balanced, healthy and fulfilling life.  Happy New Year, blessings to you.  Long live Komorebi!
😍😍😍😍
Why not try to get a caretaker/gardener to take care of Komorebi while you go and have a safe, healthy birth?  Surely, there are others who would be glad to do this.  Many blessings to you and your family in the New Year.
Jake don't be so disheartened, it's life, a new joy is coming towards you both in the shape of a lovely baby. So be optimistic, I am sure you will love this change
The seal footage 😍 is nothing I've ever seen before incredible

People must learn with jake how to spend easy life.

Rich ppl leaving it all to live in wilderness to "ruff it"🤣
🇨🇦 I'm just getting started as a new subscriber and loving following you guys on your paths. I sure hope you's keep the videos rolling as I'd love to see what's next, besides your new bundle! ❤️🇨🇦 Happy new year. With best wishes
Happy New Year! I loved the video of the dive and the clams that you caught and cooked.  Especially the sky of birds that flew in the air at the end. It said to me a new exciting chapter is beginning in your life.
Sad to see you guys taking so much time off but at the same time can appreciate the generosity of keeping us updated to this point! Wishing you  3 a happy New Year and the best of the new year and a safe and healthy birthday for baby!! I can't wait to see baby!! Please when the time comes and give us a little spoiler alert with either a boy or girl.
🇨🇦 I'm a new subscriber and have loved following along with you **3**! Thank you so much for making the videos and also for showing some of the beauty that we have here in Canada! It's so amazing to see the pictures of baby moving around in his temporary play ground! Love to see the healthy and free life you's live! In a world so full of noise, the quiet calm must be wonderful!
If you have a dark line going down from your belly button chances are, it is a boy.  I heard this to be accurate.   I had a line with all three of my boys and no line with both of my girls.  No clue why.  I'm betting it is a boy!
just a beautiful video.....waiting to see the baby.....life is beautiful.....
I hate to see you guys leave the beautiful woods, and all the work you put into it, I hope you can go back to it. I hope that your delivery goes well. I can't wait for the news of  your little bundle of joy arrives!
Whatever the Creator has in mind for you , I'm sure it will make you happy. I want to thank you for sharing this journey with us. I loved watching it. Best of Luck
Is this not considered shell fish? I thought you were not supposed to have shellfish while pregnant in the later trimesters??🤔
I’m a little bit new on this channel so forgive my ignorance but umm what does Nicole do?  All I see is Jake chopinng wood. Collecting it, cooking. Serving - is there another one of him around???  I’d like one please
Glad you are making the move to be closer to a hospital. It is rare for something to happen but you can't rule it out. You have to be smart. A friend of mine lost her sister in child birth and my great grandmother died with birth  of her 3rd child. My grandfather was only 14 at the time. Your baby looks very active and strong with all that movement. Looks like you have some good plans for the coming year. Would be nice to spend Winters somewhere warm and just come back to your homestead in summers. Best of luck to wherever the ocean leads you. Those trees you were standing next to didn't look tropical. Now you have us all guessing.🤔👍🏼🙏😊
Happy New Year you 4 soon to be 5 beautiful souls
No care taker?
THE PORN STARS MUST HAVE REALLY SCREWED UP THIS TIME ‼️
Frumoaso  nașterea  ușoară.  Un an nou fericit
✌✌✌✌✌Be happy and cheerful
Thank you Jake and Nicole for sharing your unborn child with us all it's such a wonderful merical that you both have enjoy all it has to offer soon you will be holding that beautiful baby in your arms.
Ur garden will always grow and so will ur baby a thing u don’t want to miss is it’s birth u seen the birth of ur garden so be there for ur babies birth so be there for her and baby and ur fur babies
Don't be afraid, something wonderful awaits you.  An amazing journey for both you and Nicole and your baby.  You will return if that is your desire, and gardens regrow as will your baby.  I can only imagine the magical things you can show your child.  He/she will be blessed.  Grab this experience with both hands and run with it.  Love and best wishes for 2022.
Why would you have to go away longer than to have your child ? And make. Sure it's healthy go back to your home if you and Nicole are truly happy where you are?? Prayers🙏🙏 for you both answers  to your big questions in life at this time 🧡.
Happy new Year from Germany
Step by step and the ending is wonderful Well done
🇨🇦 soooo beautiful! It's magical. Cheers to you three! Can't wait to meet baby!
Thank you for sharing
I’m confused why they couldn’t have the baby and then like wait til it got warmer and bring the baby back after?? Like why did they have to leave?
The only way you won't return will be if you don't return.
🥃🇨🇦
God Bless all 3 of you and your beautiful furbabies. Please try an get the pups some arm clothing an life jackets..to keep them warm an cozy too. Just like you..enjoy giving Birth and have happy Birth Day.
Wow, so nice to see you in the warm climate. I have been in Bali for two years now, since before covid. I love just wearing shorts only. The only problem is there are no new tourist. I like the locals though and live by the sea, so I get to eat Mahi-mahi and Barracuda fresh. Good luck with the birth and whatever comes your way. Happy new year, peace, Dennis
Congrats on your journey and the baby
I thought Jake was a vegan, did I miss something.  Someone enlighten me please.
At 27:29 the movement that makes life and the world move together with your great beautiful love!What beautiful words and images with such a beautiful and exciting ending all yours together with the nature that surrounds you with a new adventure made from a new life in front of you!Congratulations Jake is Nicole for your baby that is coming!

This is one of the best videos yet.. so beautiful.
Just show the donor already.  Jackie can’t keep this up much longer.
What’s going to to all the things you’ve built?
You guys are amazing! Can’t wait to see your new adventure in the tropics.
Jesus Christ is the one true God of the Universe and a Savior to the World, if you accept him as your Lord and Savior you will not burn in Hell and you will be happy forever. 😪
Nice video 👍
Long time sub.  never comment  but I have to say after watching you for years this is by far the smartest decision you have made in your journey. That baby is your  past you’re present and you’re future . It’s you’re everything and  the meaning of you’re union as a couple.  Wishing you all the best and God bless you both.
I love it Guys set up for off grid looks amazing n I saw u leaving well ur pregnant so it's understandable . U will be back so it's never goodbye u both are amazing
❗The word Islam means peace and submission. Muslims greet each other by saying 'Salaam alaykum' meaning 'peace be upon you'. , the majority of Muslims believe in seeking a just and peaceful world. The Qur'an teaches that Allah wants Muslims to control their aggression and approach others with peace.  {Do not let your hatred of people incite you to aggression}.ref/Qur’an 5:3)  The Qur'an For Muslims the Qur'an is of supreme importance because it is the direct words of Allah to humankind, and it is therefore treated with great respect. The Qur'an often refers to teachings about peace and reconciliation:  {Paradise is for…those who curb their anger and forgive their fellow men.}Ref/Qur'an 3:134  --------------------------------------- {Do not kill a soul which Allah has made sacred except through due process of law.} ref/Qur'an 6:51   This quote suggests that Muslims should only kill if it can be justified under Islamic law because human life is precious and belongs to Allah.  Killing of any other kind is one of the greatest sins in Islam. These sins will be judged by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  Hadith In the Hadith the Prophet Muhammad teaches that maintaining peace and good relations is very important and that Muslims should not get carried away with feelings of hatred towards others:  {Do you know what is better than charity and fasting and prayer? It is keeping peace and good relations between people, as quarrels and bad feelings destroy mankind.}ref/Hadith   Peace and equality Islam seeks peace and harmony within a community, the ummah and also between countries. Islam teaches that reconciliation is of great importance.  Peace is central to Islam and the religion aims to achieve a world without attack, conflict or unjust rulers. A peaceful solution to any situation of conflict must be sought and if an enemy offers peace Muslims should accept it. The Qur'an reminds Muslims that Allah is always watching and taking account of their actions. This belief is clearly expressed in the following verse:  {If the enemy inclines towards peace, then you should also incline towards peace and trust in Allah, for He is the One that hears and knows all.} ref/Qur'an 8:61  Islam teaches that prejudice and discrimination of any kind are wrong, because we are all creations of Allah and are therefore equal.  Some Muslims refuse to fight in contemporary wars because they believe that with modern warfare there can be no such thing as a just war. Air strikes often accidently kill innocent civilians, and chemical and nuclear weapons have the capacity to cause mass destruction to humanity and the environment.   {Whoever saved a life; it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind.} Ref/Qur'an 5:32 _____________________  I invite you to enter Islam  How can I enter Islam?  easy to enter Islam   just Say from heart♥️   I per witness that there is nothing to deserve to be worship except Allah and I per witness that Muhammad peace and pleasant be upon him is his slave and messenger from Allah  This is all you need to become a Muslim  And to be become in heaven and escape from hell  If you said from your heart .  congratulations . you are a Muslim now 💞 💞🟢I invite you to worship theGod(Allah)🟢 💕alone  Allah  is the Forgiving, the Merciful, the King, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.

Um yeah clean that yard up and go back south ya Yankees. Eh
Always a breathtakingly beautiful video but the ending was stellar! Love it, love you guys, can't wait to see your new little off-grid creation!
Nicole, I saw you scrubbing your belly, remember to also scrub your breasts with maybe something softer to prepare them for nursing. You'll be happy you did.
I truly understand for the need of privacy at this time. It is my hope that you may return so we may share in your lives once again. You are truly a blessing to see. You show us how we can live without technology for the most part live off the land as we should. It feels like we're losing a friend right now but we hope our friend will return back soon if you folks are ready, until then may God be with you and bless you and your baby.
Well, you can always live off the sea, and travel with the wind. see Riley and Elayna vagabond . No Bears, but you have Sharks!
Jake,     suggestion,   let a piece of wood float in the hot tub, this will alow expansion room when the water freezes
Real Talk Guy's God Blessed You Both, We've Never met. But These Few Years Following You. Has Been Eye Opening Sole Searching, For Me personally and I Thank You, God Bless...
I told my co workers about your channel they really enjoy watching you guys. I would love to live in the manner as you. God bless 🙏🏽
What am I missing here?  I understand being in a place closer to medical help if needed during the labor and delivery, but I can't believe that you are not coming back to this incredible place you have built.
So excited for you guys :) Nice drop at the end.
恭喜即將當母親了，是男的還是女的呢？🤔🤔🤔
It a Boy Congrats ( :
She's no longer there to help you, so now you're in it with her,she's number 1.
You’re both making the right decision - I’m a midwife and we’ll know the risks - think of it this way you can always grow a garden back not a life…..
It's not about you sir, it's about Nicole, she's the one with the baby. You need to stop. It's all about her and the baby.  She will make it about you both, but at the end of the day it's all about her and her baby. ❤❤❤
I have 7 children and absolutely love what you both are about. Becoming parents will change everything but you will see that all you have put in to your life will mean more a hen you see your child learn from you.
Scallops arent vegan.
Your place is awesome 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
I wish you the best whatever choice you make and do not envy your dilemma.  You will not be happy not doing a garden and knowing you and your family living and eating healthy.regardless of where you decide to live.
I must of missed something while watching tonight. I keep wondering why you are leaving? Are you leaving for good or just taking a break. I wish you both health, love and happiness wherever you may be.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!! HOPE TO SEE YOU GUYS SOON..GOD BLESS AND BE SAFE...
i'm thinking COSTA RICA!,  be a nice place,  wild looking fruit there.
I can't believe in a few short months, we will hear baby, cues. crys, & talk...lol
Interesting times ahead for you all - best of luck on things to come !!!
Happy New Year to you all!  Pro Tip: Once you cut your word and split it, it will take 1 -2 years for it to dry enough for the modern wood stoves. If you burn wood that is too wet (>20%) you will build creosote in your stove pipe.  All the best to you and your baby! Do get a real check up before you deliver.
There is an endless beauty to hope and to work.   Do what must be done, the wise and the useful, the necessary, the noble and even difficult, then reward yourself keeping hope and working the dream.  Sacrifice one thing for the other, the last for the next and the once hopeless for the now real, but always, always, keep the beauty, the hope and the work within you, no matter the world... keep an endless beauty to your souls wherever you go...  Best wishes to you!
a blessed new year
love you guys
Why didn't you just have a home birth
:) this is getting exciting.
That’s funny this is our bug out property if your needing to “bug out” then the concept of property is out the window it’s the strongest survive all others are just resources
Happy New Year to you both and I hope 2022 brings a whole new life to you both
Love you guys!
For real. Thanks to you O have learned  which plants thrive in a desert and cold environment. Can't wait for the next journey.
Found any mushrooms?
it will only become a distant memory if you allow it to. " by your will, you shape the world...". ahava shalom.
Wonderful video. I love watching your amazing journey.. listening to what you share. Its very enlightening. Blessings to you and sweet baby.  😌💖💖💖
It's awesome to see your baby moved
I fear for you Jake I understand
Happy New Year
I would never leave that place it's perfect  in the best climate anyone could ask for I started watching because of where you were at.
much love and happy new year! jake get that baby to a safe place man you know alaska/canada wilderness is no place to raise a child on leaves an grass with no proper medicine! i hate to see your awesome hideaway go bye bye but dude in the boat can watch it! yall will be back! respect.  prayers to you nicole on a healthy baby ! i will watch your guys journey no matter what! <3
Go have the baby and come back in the spring/summer/autumn
I'm thinking Central America. Belize? Costa Rica? Panama? Those would all be great winter places where you could live sustainably and off grid. Perhaps one of the best cliffhangers on YouTube. Well Done.
I have enjoyed following your journey.  Happy New Year 🎆  You all will have a beautiful baby, boy or girl.  Thank you. Dr. George Neff

This is for the beginning of this episode. Trent & Alley wanted to do the same, But thank god they were near a hospital because Leo was born 3 weeks early and had bowel complication  3 days later. It will all be there waiting for you that's not important at the moment. That's the way life goes. You have a bigger journey ahead that no ones ever prepared for. If there's one thing I know a child will mess up your ying & yang for sure and for awhile more then you think. Then before you know it your puzzle you tried so hard to keep together for so long that was broken up will just go back together all on it's own when your child picks up on it. Stay safe Stay positive.🙏😇👍
If your plan is to return to Komorebi, you could make it back in plenty of time to start the new planting season to not skip a beat. Especially if you could get someone to mind the store in the interim. Especially because winter is off season for planting anyway.
Nothing like making Nicole feel bad for being pregnant. “ You’ve “ lost your garden before and now there’s a risk of having a healthy baby and not coming back again. This kinda sounds like all about “You”. @ 4:58. Sorry if your offended by this comment but it’s not about you anymore. Part of being a parent now. A dream that once was…even Nicole’s aura and body posture when you said A dream that once was…she feels at fault by your statements.
nice happy new year! The scallops, looked so go, never had the roe, looked good too. You two got a world cup soccer player there, lots of goal kicks!  thank you stay safe
We were so very worried when Jake was in the water, so very relieved to see you get outta the water. We trust that y’all will come back too Komorebi after the birth of your child, y’all have worked too hard to not return and raise your growing family there We pray that we can see you share that part of your lives as well, eventually…
Jake and Nicole you have a whole lot of youth enjoy it and your new life. I can't wait to see what you both are going to do next.  You are so loved and blessed
We were so very worried for you Jake, those Orcas are killer whales for a reason as you kno, we were so relieved to see you get outta the water. You will come back to Komorebi and raise your growing family after you child’s birth; we are sure of it…
will there never be videos again?
You guys will be back.. once baby has arrived you all won’t want to be anywhere else!
One of the best way that I make body butter is you make it like you did then whip it in a blender and when it’s whipping then you add essential oils I use the same recipe you do and that’s what I do to add that essential oils because you don’t want to add him when it’s hot. It makes it easier and smoother to blend it on your body.
💜
Whaaaaaaaatttt?????
If it is meant to be, it is meant to be..  I agree your family’s safety is your top priority! And not all pregnancies go smoothly although I have hope and pray that yours does go well!  I’m sure after baby is born you’ll both be eager to get back at it
🙌🙌🙌❤❤❤
Life is shifting and we must be in a flow to shift with it.  Love this message:)  Happy 2022 to a magical couple!

God bless you all and your baby boy! Boys!?
OH MY GOD! PLOT TWIST!

What made you decide to leave after sooo much hard work??? Love you guys ♥️
Australia
Coming this year antigrav scooters and antigrav vehicles with unlimited power that you will be able to bug out to a tropical place or anywhere on this planet.
Noooooo! haha Loved that ending though.  Love you guys.  Prayers for your safety and wisdom.
Happy New Year Nicole and Jake! 🎉 It's wonderful watching you both enjoying your "Blue Heaven". G_d bless you in all your endeavors. We got some snow here in Prescott, Arizona. https://youtu.be/25Ik6jNR5YA
Nicole I think you having a baby boy ! Love the scallops 😋 Happy New Year 2022🍾🥂🙏
I have confidence that whatever you guys choose is going to be an amazing adventure!  I do hope you get back to Canada after the baby birth.❤️❤️❤️
No one to take care of the place while ur gone? Hmm
Nicolle you are absolutely GLOWING! I had identical twin girls my first pregnancy & I remember standing at the checkout in the grocery store & the young cashier could see both of my babies turning flips as I was paying & she was amazed just as I was my entire pregnancy at just how incredible the woman's body is. Even more so during & right after birth. If you lay the newborn on your stomach right when it comes out with no assistance the baby will inch its way to your breast to nurse & satisfy that suckle instinct it has....just as puppies, kittens & most other animals do! IT'S BEAUTIFUL to watch! Did you watch Kaylee's home birth on Nomadic Movement  channel? It was beautiful. I honestly believe you're having a girl. I could be wrong but I just got that feeling watching this video & I haven't had a feeling either way while watching all of your other videos. Wishing you guys THE HAPPIEST OF A NEW YEAR as you embark on this new journey of being parents to a human that no doubt will be just as amazing & beautiful as you are!
NICOLLE   use hair conditioner on belly to help prevent streachmarks
تحياتي لكم من المغرب ربي يحفظكم
Both of your sending positive energy  I am from sir lanka. I love this nature , love earth and thank you for give these for world.
Not sure why I got so bothered by you guys podcast, but... being a parent requires responsible actions and the responsible thing to do is be where resources are available in case of emergencies.  I've been following you guys for a while and I do admire  and respect all the hard work y'all have done. Y'all have done amazing things. It doesn't mean nothing what I think, but I really get bothered when young folks get all high and mighty. Technology is here for a reason. All those downed trees wouldn't have happened without that chain saw. No under water diving without that swim suit. No supplies without that boat and motor that get y'all back and forth. No living in comfort without those manufactured home dwellings...yurts, log single units, solar panels, wood burning stoves,  ice box and the list goes on. Not to mention how you guys get to do this... because of people like me who watch and help y'all get paid to live this kind of life. Because of all the technology that you have - cameras, go pro's, and drone's. So, you guys want to live like this, very admirable. Y'all can buy land anywhere and do these things. Y'all have proved that y'all can. Funny thing is, is people want this life style until they don't or it doesn't benefit them. All I'm saying is don't be hypocrites. We all have to do our part, but I thank God for modern technology. Y'all are good, hard working, kind  people. That's why y'all have so many followers to help y'all achieve what y'all want. All I'm trying to say is, don't make life choices complicated. Be grateful and thankful for what y'all have accomplished. Deal with whatever life deals you! Use y'all's yin and yang! That's y'all's thing and I wasn't really hearing that in y'all's message today! People need people! Jake, Nicole....you got this! Relax, Relate, and Release!
It's a boy!❤❤❤❤❤
Your yin yang is not at a place. It’s the world you create with those you love. They will provide balance anywhere you pause on the journey. Blessings…trust in the commitment. Thank You
So living off the grid is only great when it's convenient.  There are doctors and a Hospital in Port Hardy if you need one.  I suppose you've made enough money off your channel, you don't need to do it anymore.  I hope your baby arrives healthy and well.  Just don't continue the "off the grid sham"
Jake seems to be good at giving a guilt trip to get his way...keep that shit to yourself, we've all got sadness...try not to burden me with yours.
And why are you leaving?   Wow, on the scallops.  That was awesome with the flock of birds.  Why plant any more on that unless you have someone to stay in the yurt?  Stay safe & take care of you all.  Thanks for sharing eh :))
Old Testament Genesis God creates this earth and its heaven and all forms of life in six days—The creative acts of each day are described—God creates man, both male and female, in His own image—Man is given dominion over all things and is commanded to multiply and fill the earth.  32:21 32:40 33:06 33:10  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
Hard decisions. I hope you are all well, you will return with a beautiful healthy baby and life will be splendid.
I have friends in Nova Scotia who always go scallop diving and I so miss getting scallops so fresh off the east coast. I'm not familiar with Pacific Coast scallops , nor do I trust them since fukashima.
If you're on YouTube you're not off the grind
Wtf are you babbling on about?
so u guys build all the stuff and now you are leaving it ?
Did you guys moved to Hawaii? Please, tell me you didn’t ……
I wish I can find someone to do this with
The thumbnail is tacky and desperate for views shame
Our minds are constant thought visions. We have to learn which to dwell on. If you let your mind create something that causes stress, that is a bad that, choose again. Some thoughts come into your reality. Make sure the thought you dwell on is something that you wouldn’t mind have in your life.  Pease Brother, Drink from the fountain that gives you life!
Dang that’s crazy y’all are leaving so much behind.. please don’t be long..
Happy New year 🎉 with so much joy to come as you bring New life ❤️ to the 🌎
Happy new year
Happy new year Jake n Nicole .. Sending ❤️ fromKuala Lunpur, Malaysia 🥰😘😘
Something I’ve wondered this entire time maybe a stupid question but is this land owned, or public?
Click bait is real
Best wishes to you whatever decisions you make.  Your home in the north seems very nice... your new home...?  Take care.  Enjoy your child - they are worth the time and effort.
Did you sell your resort?
so where are you going anyway? are the dogs and cat's going too, is this just until spring.
Amazing episode!  Cant wait to see where to journey leads. Wishing you a safe and healthy delivery of your baby!
Y'all are have deep thoughts of the garden home you built here is to your success in Parenthood so many people only dream of being a father mother. May your journey be filled with amazing memories of growth in the coming season of life.
Thats a cliff Hanger ending
Ahhh what ?
Great Video,,Happy Holidays From Wv
The Yurt is  no place to raise a child . A child needs medical support and of course  social surroundings - other kids to play with etc …
YEEEESSSS GREAT ENDING .I feel like I was watching a movie.  I love it. Can't wait to see the nested one.
I've been watching you guys for over a year! You two are so fit. There should be no fear in having your baby there at your home. You should fear more of coming inland with the world being what it is! Have your  midwife come to you. Nichols will be fine! Bring in your higher self to you heart chakra and project out positive light on your vision of what you want, you are a warrior! No fear no fear be strong! You two will do what's right. You guys are with mother Gaia she will be there to guide you also! I will be sending you two positive light energy and love! Thanks for letting me be part of your journey! I've so enjoyed the ride! You two are so amazing!
Hi Nicole and Jake, Happy New Year  and all the best for 2022. I agree with you Jake,  it is too remote to have a baby. It's better to be on the safe side  and God bless you both and your  new arrival. I love your channel.
Please .. Mark this down...im saying a girl  buy the way youre carrying  ..  I had all 3 girls and carried the same way  all three times.  I dont know.....other than that.. I just feel it
Life is definitely about choices, and having a needing to have someone or people in your life,means you just can not ever really be free to follow your path of life.
We will one day go back to where we once came from to me thats home and not of this fallen world, and that home is GOD!
Great ending !
U people are crazy and how come you have soo much energy at 7months pregnant and with that belly growing soo fast ... are you guys going to build up an entire house kitchen bathroom in that tropic place???
If you are afraid of losing your place to live you should have taken precautions when love making to avoid having a child
Les digo algo es un varon si.si........
wise choice because of your soon to be here child that will need the "other world" to be able to handle what ever will come along. A hospital is always good and the first few years they need to be close to handle anything. You both put such energy and will into the adventure and maybe it will work out and maybe it won't, move on and see where it goes.
Should be baby girl by tummy shape, much love
Wshing you guys the best and hope you can be safe without being forced  to be vaccinated while pregnant or even before- with your hollistic life style I am pretty sure you guys found a way! Love all the changes you made to the homestead!
Each day is new day new beginning loves you both dearly may ur dreams come true blessings amen 😊🤗💕☮️
You are not isolated look at all these wonderful People who support you guys you can get help now! People can help...
This has been my favourite comedy channel for ages. My conclusions ; they were never vegans,after filming they both tucked into good hearty steaks. Nicole has a particularly carnivorous look about her. They were never "off grid" not with that prodigious use of power tools. Jake has sold the property and I expect for a good profit too. They are never going back. It was obvious from the start they weren't serious because if they were they would have set to building a proper house in a neat and tidy setting not living in a tent among fallen branches and stumps everywhere. Not only did the whole surroundings look like a serious trip hazard but it looked disgusting and derelict. Last, I think they will split up,maybe they already have.  I know I'm being a hate but I've thought all along it was all my eye and Betty Martin. But just say some beautiful filming of the area,the sea and shores in the locality.
Woww - I thought you guys were quitting youtube. What a page turner...
Jeff talks too much...
Wow, such mixed feelings about this one! Excited to come along on your new adventure with a new lil bub on board and new environment, but damn am I going to miss Komorebi! I wish you guys all the best with the delivery and I can't wait to see what's in store in the new place but I also do hope to continue to see you guys back in the cold country 🤞 I know all will be revealed soon, is this a seasonal thing? Winter in the tropics, summer in mountains or vise versa? Oh gosh I'm so excited and sad at the same time...a good balance though! 😉❤
Wherever life takes you, be it at Komorebie or on your "bug-out" island, just know that you two will always live your best lives when together, wherever that may be.  Happy New Year and all the best on your last trimester and soon as new parents!
Looking fantastic.  Happy New Year!  Thank you so much for showing me the bottom of the ocean where you hunt for your food.  I almost felt like I was swimming with you. I love how you live and wish you all the best with your new baby and the wonderful journey  ahead.
did you sail to hawaii?  cause that would be DOPE
You have to make and name a product "Itchy belly body butter"  the name is great and you could make it organic with natural ingredients.
that flock of birds was awesome...happy holidays you two
Dude! Come just  back after the baby is born😳 and if you wanna wait till after the baby turns one then do that just come back off and on to take care of the garden😐
bullshit
get ready to loose some sleep you all. Good luck with the next trimester.  With with a child is so different. your life is about to change so much. I love to listen to Nichole talking about the female body. the female body is quite amazing. The things that our body's go through is amazing. when that baby comes, and you are parent, you will start doing things to protect the baby then the toddler and on and on. you will find your self living your life for your child. you will do everything in your power to keep your child safe. Good luck guys. I will see you on the next video
Beautiful belly :) So glad you are both in the "know" and are staying away from the whole V narrative.  A life well lived. Best wishes on your next adventure. Such an amazing spot to leave but I imagine you will be somewhere just as pretty, to share with the world. Blessings.
Happy new year I am watching your episode here in Kiwi Land New Zealand 🇳🇿 Queenstown
whait....WHAT!?!?!?!!?!? They are moove on!???    WOW))))))  NICE)))
i think Jake is just panicking and is a bit scared. Quite normal  Just take a deep breath Jake and trust Nicole's instincts .
I'm confused. You planted all this and plan more so you can be self sustainting as you often talked about.  I waited to see how you were going to can and preserve the food for winter as you often talked about but that never happened. You've been eating fresh veggies and not seeing any canned/preserved stuff other than a few things you forage and dry.  Did it just go to the compost?   Have a good new year!
Jake...
Jake dont overthink things!
Go to the city to have the baby and then come back home in the spring. Find someone to watch the homestead. Once all goes well, you can have the second baby at home. ha.
Look at that little kicker go!! 😱😅 you two are gonna have your hands full next Christmas!! 😁🤘🏻 Good Luck !!
You will be okay just have fate , god bless both of you  sorry the 3 of you .
That was point of property manager I thought?. What happened to the little kid you had in the bunkee?  Also dang those were some giant scallops!!
wow that wee one is hyper like Jake
Good vives guys You Will return  🙋💕
Just leave us hanging lol.
trust in your wife she is from USA and they are good loyal women is all i can offer as a statement
The end left my mouth gaping.... Beautiful family! Can't wait to see what is next. <3
YEEEESSSS!!!! Let's go somewhere WARM!!!  I'm in Florida, and it's dipping into the 60's tonight. BRRRRRRRRR!!!
My tears feel your true feelings. Go and do everything while you are young!!!
هلا والله انشاء الله ولادة مباركة ونتمنى لك السلامة والصحة والعمر المديد💕💕💋💋💞💞💞💞💔💔💔💔💖💖💖💖💖💖احبكم وانا من العراق
I knew you guys would be leaving there to have the baby.  As a first time mum I completely understand not wanting to be fully off grid and having a baby, being so far away from everything and it's all such a new experience for you both.  It's funny, i'm in the exact same position as you guys, except my partner will be staying off grid at the food forest because we have different paths and priorities.  I'm sure you will all go back there as a family soon.  It's totally in alignment for you guys to live there with what's coming and you have put in such hard work, but a good idea to leave temporarily to have your baby somewhere Nicole feels safe. If you have a second baby you will probably feel comfortable to have the baby off grid and do a free birth no worries once you've done it once and know what to expect lol
I wish you all the best and have enjoyed your Journey. You are on another journey now but hope once it’s feasible return to your roots with your child. All the best!
Gordan Ramsey has nothing on you all.
Nicole and Jake: You create such high quality and interesting content. Looking forward to seeing what your family is up to next! Jake, I’ve been consuming your content since your Arizona garden. It is clear that you are a producer, where ever you are.The news of a tropical bug out property is so cool!  -Tsvi
HERMOSA EXPERIENCIA PARA RECORDAR CUANDO SU BEBÉ SEA GRANDE👍👏🇨🇱💝
Meu nome é Ana Lucia frazao bezerra e eu sou de Pernambuco cidade Caruaru e sempre que eu posso eu vejo seus vidios,adoro ver vcs juntos e agora e que tá mais unidos ainda mais pois esse neném que está vindo aí e aprova do amor de vcs dois lindo como e lindo ver um casal viver da forma como vcs vivi,o lugar e lindo paz amonia e muita mas muita natureza tudo que fãs ainda mais crecer esse amor que e tão bonito o senário em que essa criança vai ser criada e maguinifico e muito especial, parabéns a toda família e um feliz ano novo pra vcs,vó continuar vendo vcs daqui tá abraços seu vizinhos são uma fofura
It is totally amazing what you have there.  I can feel your pain to leave this home.  Your skills in building this home is beyond belief.  I spent 10 years on submarines and grew to love seafood.  I hope your baby is born with the daddy's wisdom and mommy's beauty.  Gods blessings.
this is a joke or what...
Happy New Year's my lovlys 🎉💞🧸 🎉🐾🐾🐾🐾I believe you  Own a very large slice of heaven" Namaste 🙏🎐🎋🎍🧧
Happy New Year. Wishing you all the best and a wonderful delivery.  I hope you will keep making videos, I have become attached to both of you.  ❣
Sorry I missed the sadness of this video. I really didn't realize you were leaving... that is really hard... I'm sure it will continue to be fun seeing you in your new location in warm weather, it looks like.
do you think that you will ever have a beautiful yard without pieces of the trees all around.
wow if that's not a cliff hanger..
I loved watching your bellys activities... it resurged my memories. I'm 68 years old, my kids are 44 and 46 and when I saw how active the baby was, I literally was thrown back in time of the fabulous, wonderful, sweetness of my firstborn. He was like a little football tackle in my belly... that was the best part of the video!!!!!!
The tropical bushland at the end looks like you're in Australia 🇦🇺
WHAT!!! what a punch wow
Love watching your video, praying for healthy 3rd trimester, safe delivery. Keeping your family on the pray list.
What a load of faff. In other words you had enough at playing Robinson Crusoe. You know you can't nurture a baby in that gyppo camp you've knocked up. You've got to go and live in a human community with the facilities we need. Because we're not bears or wolves. I get your sadness at leaving your garden. I'm sorry  I'm being a hater. I came across your channel seeking garden channels. You've got too much f..... money mate. The expenditure on your creation,all that kit,the power tools,no benefit of contemporary technology left out,and trying to kid us you both were living "off grid". I live more "off grid" than you and I live in a town. But yes,that is one of the most beautiful locations in the world,long may it stay that way. But a lot of us knew,and said,you were only playing but then,why not,if you can afford it.
🤝🌲🎄
👍
You guys are extremely inspirational. I haven't watched every single one of your videos, but to see the progress that has continued every once in a while I come on here, its so amazing. Keep making more memories, jeez I love how far both of you have come 👍🏼❤️
!00% boy> now it is so obvious.
Do not dwell on the coulds.   A child can bring you closer to yourself. To understand a truth not yet realized.  You are the spirit of Komorebi! It will always be with you. It is always there.                                                                                       A new life experience awaits. A child born to the world needing love, understanding, patience, and direction. Look to the child's parents! It will become who they are. A reflection of themselves. Life could not have picked a better duo!   Your book has just begun. A new chapter just revealed! Enjoy this time!  Komorebi will sleep for a while! And fend for itself as nature does. And rejoice at your return!!!  Happy New Year!!! Congratulations!!!                  PEACE
Rain forest you Mean Jungle.
First I want 2 say . That I'm a fan. #1  . #2 I think and feel like yall are good people.  Now. I feel like this. I don't think that it's fair that yall have been misleading me. I say Me. The truth is you 2 are a privileged couple!!! With cabin/camp property that u have made a bunch of $ off of by acting like that's ur real life!!!!! Or maby I was a fan. U 2 r nothing more than white Suburbia people. With a cute cabin getaway that you were privilege enough to be able to be able to build up... !!! I feel lied to by U2 the truth is is y'all go back to Suburbia whenever you want to so no you don't really live the off-grid life just enough to make your videos and make money off of and then you go right back to your house next to the grocery store for real I'm a little disgusted why didn't you just say in the beginning that it's your side property and not your real house
I absolutely can’t wait to see where the second location is. Success and blessings along with prayers too, for you all.
Sounds like south east Asia area
Jake, your thoughts, although natural and common, are actually irrational and the usual fears and anxieties of new fathers.  There is a big change coming and it is something you have not been privy to up till now.  Nicole, being in the job already for 7 months, has already got a genetically detailed blueprint plan laid out in her head and her heart and she has probably less fears of the future than you do.  For us men, our journey doesn't start until we lay eyes on our newborn child.  Once that moment occurs, the whole world changes and all things that were important before are no longer important.  And all the insignificant before, suddenly become significant.  Jake, you are also frightened that as a new father you won't be able to keep up the level of work required to keep your home in the forest alive and viable.  You fear something happening to your child and then having to somehow get them to safety for medical attention. Well, didn't you both take all this into consideration prior to moving out there?  Surely you did, because you clearly planned to have children.  So if that is the case, then follow your original plans.  You have a good solid base built up for your home now.  It will not degrade in the time you are away.  Sure you'll have some work getting back to where you were, because you'll be behind with planting, but maybe the next thing you build is a large greenhouse so you can actually grow somethings out of season.  Take a breath Jake. Do what is necessary for your child to come into this world safely, which means returning to civilization.  Then return as soon as the baby is able to travel.  Ensure that you have all things ready at home for the baby's arrival, before leaving.  You're an organised man.  So, get organised and follow the numbers.  Do this and your anxiety will lesson.  Have faith.  I am not a follower of the pagan religion you follow, but as a Christian I know that faith is a very powerful force.  You have faith in your home, the ground it sits on, the ability for it to grow food, your ability to build and create, your wife's ability to do all the things you cannot.  That is what you call ying and yang I think.  I just call it the laws of nature and balance.  Faith drives it all.  Without faith in each other, in yourself, and in God, we have nothing.   If Nicole has decided that she cannot live in that world with a new born, then I guess you have a problem. That is something you will both have to work out and decide when you can return.  If that is not the case, then there is no problem.  There is only delays in your plans, because they have been deliberately put on hold for the wonderful child that God has given you.  Rejoice and hold the faith!
special...besause have the emocional.
Hi. Your hair is beautiful what shampoo do you use?
and you need to get over your self , I watch this one you tube fideo and they in Panama on home stead they are building still and went back to bosten and had there baby and yes its been like 4 month when the last time she saw home so ya go have the baby and you go back check your home and stuff and when her and baby bring them home so stop with belly backing and man up
Me parece muy deshonesto un tipo que quiere capìtalizar el canal mostrando todo el tiempo el culo de la mujer.
That seal was so cute! He just wanted a play buddy 🥰
Jake your message really touched me. I am from Seattle and I met my wife in Phoenix. I’ve been here for 11 years. I miss the ocean so bad. We went to Hawaii for our ten year anniversary and I fell in love with the island. All my stress melted away and my mental health was at ease.
Happy New Year & may God Bless you!
🤯 Best wishes and good health.
Very very beautiful couples both loniglive
Nichole hun ..just add the essential oils to your bully rub now...warm it by the stove and stir some in
Nicole's statement at the end... "If only we had a place to bug out".. You ARE There...your nitch that you have carved out of the wilderness...I S  your retreat from the kaose of the modern world.  And it is BEAUTIFUL. To be able to NOT have to rely on a 3rd party to survive...Live..Function,  or have to hear sirens, noise from auto's, or Any noise that comes from a city... I S    PARADISE
I wish I could watch over your garden while you are away.  But I’m too old. 🥴. It’s winter.  The garden can rest.
Happy New year to both of you 💓
Go rent a place for a few months near a hospital.  Have a home birth near a hospital.  Then go back home.  You’ll be fine for 5 years until school starts.  You must keep up your garden, Nicole understands… love and blessings dear children.  ☺️🙏😚
Happy New Years guys
I am so sorry about this. not sure what would make it possible to go back. I hope you can find a way to come back.it has been so amazing watching you both make a life there. to being able to go back home
The very idea that if you were to leave for the birth of your child gives you fear you might not return causes me to wonder if your truly committed to this and just telling yourself you are for reasons known only by you or you’ve put soooo much stock into this place that it has fully Become your sole identity (unhealthy) and that somehow your leaving your own soul behind when in truth this place is just a place and not your identity and soul. I can understand your concern that if something went wrong you’d be far away from any real help and that would keep me up at night too but it’s just a place in time you’d be gone, why would returning be so difficult? Unless of course you feel you’d be walking away from your.........god. Which would explain the sense of betrayal you seem to be exuding and the worship you keep giving it.
incredible outpour of your heart in the beginning, i resonate a lot with the same feelings this new year, introverted with an extroverted girlfriend, and wanting to be better, and learn and grow.
Wishing you all the best and happy new year.  Stay positive
we always eat the entire scallop. You could just use a cardboard tube for listening to the fetal heart.
How long are you planning to be away? It will all work out I believe you are having a baby boy⚽️
Both of you have been building a life, and for a new life to live with you,  where ever you are. That was for Nichole.  What the hell are you thinking about going anywhere else but the planet.  That was for both of you.
You have to be careful and keep your belly warm.  The baby needs warmth just as it will when you give birth to him.
Costa Rica???
https://youtu.be/CqdL36VKbMQ
what??? you guys are leaving for the islands?? damn did you sold the property in BC .. i would be interessted....
being a new father or mother brings many emotions, especially fear..  I lived in it for years when my first was born..  then I just had to say, what will be will be..  children come into your life Jake, they fit into your life (yes at first its about them but never stop your dream because of the baby, dont put that pressure on the child... its not their fault.. ) you dont want this child to grow thinking it was their fault you left this place.. but honestly. you are in the best place to raise children.. you and Nicole are capable...  coconut is as close to breast milk so grow coconuts..  home schooling is an option and children adapt to their surroundings..  unless Nicole wants to move away, theres many people living just like you are..   when I had my first, I could never watch a scary movie again..  its ok Jake, all parents have the same thoughts as you are having now..  mamma int the only persons hormones that are changing. yours are too..   what will be will be, no premeditation or assumptions.. find your peace again.. and if you leave, well you have memories, just like when you created your garden in the desert..   a place is not the home but the people around you are your home.. 🦋✨💜
It's a girl
What is yin and yong?  Iv heard of yin and yang🤔
Please tell me you brought the dogs?
And another thing there Mr. Jacob, if you go back to the grid, you will eat it tainted food. God called you to where your dreams are, satan will definitely be calling you to come back to his death camp. The crossroads are no joke.
Don't be afraid Jake. Just as the new growth of the forest is hiding under the snow, your child's new life is hiding in Nicole. Both are sustainable. There are seasons to everything. Be blessed!
Very wise Jake. To have your child near a major hospital.
Why not vegan any more? What happened? Vegan scallops...lol
It’s clearly Hawaii😉 that’s my best guess anyhow.
They're in Costa RIca
WHAT ? 😊🌞 Hawai'i ???
Jake whats red parts in shells
Women are the tree of life, men are just fertilizers lol.
The female body is incredible, it birthed the Son of God.
Were you pruning cherry trees at the start there?  Hawaii by any chance?
Happy New Year To the 3 of you!!!   AND the adventure continues!!!!!!!
Muchas gracias por la buena calidad del video son los mejores y todas las bendiciones del mundo para ustedes y su bebé que viene de camino
The ending shot is just them at Seamus O'Leary tropical fruit trees backyard.
Happy new year!!!
I cant believe your leaving just because your having a baby 👀
Hypnobirth!
Oh Jake, you are scared and I understand. Your world is about to turn upsidedown by this little human. But have a little faith. In Nicole, but most of all, in yourself. You can do this. You guys will build your family here and a beautiful garden. You will come back....Just wait and see. And I so hope you let us watch. Again, you can do this, Nicole can do this. Is there a more beautiful place to bring up a child/children then were you are now?!?! It's all going to be ok. Lot's of love from the Netherlands, Daniëlle 🙋😘
what a cliffhanger   ha ha ha ha
Hey guys in your videos will be amazing if you share the recipes 🙏
Best wishes!
Time to get the hell out of the woods buddy
Bruh... the best thing you can do is to raise yur child in that home. not in civilization. not in a city, how i wish i could have raised  my kids from the worlds  mess, the technology... everything that is not nature. Children need outdoors as much as a Mom and Dad. and remember your child is safer there from disease and corrupt evil influence we deal with every day. Be Blessed! Happy New Year 2022
Happy New Year and excited to see 3 of you in 2022
Then why leave?
Man this felt like a season finale for a tv show
Happy New year :)
In a cold place, covered with white snow, may our baby always be healthy.
You Guys ROCK !!
So, you found someplace to spend all that YouTube money; GOOD FOR YOU !  Jake, I'm with you on the baby birth (or was that just 'drama' to lead to the new location?
Such an excellent video.  Jake the opening segment was beautiful and you almost made me cry.  I can't wait to see your tropical adventure and that new precious baby.  Happy New Years Jake, Nicole and baby.  Been following your journey for years.  I just don't really comment very much, but watch every single video.  Many blessings to you in the new year.
What a drama queen!
Woah I got goosebumps at the end! YESSS 🌞🌴
I Love It! You guys are Genius!
Why the drama, you'll are just going to have that child, he is such a drama queen
Hawaii?  😄  I would say Canada was more of a bug out location.
Do you really believe pain is the opposite of pleasure? You should go back to reading your books.
What an epic journey so far, and we've all loved joining you along the way. That was a sneaky little tease, for what adventure lies ahead... Nice! Can't wait. Good luck with everything you pair, keep it real. 😁✌️
Congratulations!!! Is gonna be hard not to see you, but we love you and is understanding that family time is good and enjoyable. My best wishes
🙏❤️
I just saw the end. Tropical bug out seriously. I hope you come back to what you built
Nice
So beautiful
You all can come back after the baby is borned.  The thing is you will be back.  You can either send your wife off to have the baby by herself. And you stay and tend your garden in the winter. Or you can go and see your first borned child come into the world.
Best wishes for continued happiness, health and adventure.
Bravo off Grid / Jake & Nicolle..
*LOL IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR LEAVING A LOT BEHIND! I mean you picked one if the """"HARDEST TERRAINS ON THE PLANET TO BUILD A GARDEN JAKE""""" - I'm  just saying!*  An easier environment you can actually build a REAL HOME... A YURT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.... ITS NOT!
I hope your animals are going with you
Jake, I have been watching you and Nicolle since you built the Yurt. Hearing you heartfelt concerns today about possibly leaving and loosing what you have built prompted my very first comment to you two. What you have there in your work is a home that any child would be well served to be raised in. What our society and it's culture offer is physically dangerous and spiritually toxic. There is risk in riding a bus, eating from grocery stores, or even waking up in urban life. Those in my opinion are the real threats to you and your family.  What you are doing now is teaching others how to live well as to be good stewards of creations true gifts to man. Since the onset of your pregnancy I have thought what a great legacy you will hand your child, skills of independence, compassion, and intelligence. I believe no matter what you decide, your child will be blessed with knowledge and compassion for what life should be about. You two make me wish my nearly 67 years had been lived very differently. I do however live vicariously through you. All the best to the two of you.    Sincerely from Maine,   Joe P.
mean like.. maybe hire a workhand to maintain the property while you are away? I did that for a couple who lived on a boat in Miami.. i know a boat vs a homestead are totally different.. but maybe? also i only did that for a year.. sooo maybe not i dunno
Thank you. And look forward to seeing where you go next. Sad to see you leave knowing the hard work you put into all you created..
Happy New year Jake n Nicole.. Best of luck for your future ahead..😍❤️🌹😁
Jake Getting way too deep...She was actually laughing. People have been having babies long before hospitals...Enjoy what you have and as long as you have your family who wants to stay —Why would you consider leaving?. Don’t let the little voice in your head  Overthink and  ruin what you have in the moment
I love this channel and all the other channels that remind us of how precious life is and how much nature can teach us. Best wishes to you both (and baby)! Remember, don't go seeking contentment, be content where you are.
Wow!!! What a wonderful vlog!! You guys are amazing!!
The ending was a surprise! Good for you!
nice
<3
My friend one can still lose all their eggs even in multiple baskets if one doesn't walk carefully.  I live in the city and my son was born at Royal Colombian hospital.  After he was born he needed the type of medical attention they didn't have at Royal Colombian. Even though we were less than a half hour away from children's hospital he didn't make it. We might as well have been a thousand miles away because nothing could have changed what happened. This is life brother. This is the circle. It sounds to me like you don't realize what you have. The grass may look Greener over here but it's not. Please believe me.  On top of it all that, this Covid situation that's been unleashed apon us, has got some of us making moves to do exactly what you are doing. As a matter of fact I've Been watching your videos and others like it to learn as much as I can about living this life style because in a few months I'm going off grid myself.  Of course it's your decision to make and I wish you well no matter what that decision is. I want to thank you for posting your videos they've been a great help and I've learned a lot from watching them. You and your lady seem like a wonderful people and I'd feel honored to call you a friend.  I believe that family is the most important thing In life. Hold on strong brother.  I wish I had my girl with me still but I lost her to a heroin addiction and to the streets of the dtes Vancouver.
My guess is somewhere on the east coast of Australia - Maybe Byron Bay.
The two of you should really wear life vests.
Happy New Year! Hope you have great year! Looking forward to see your beautiful baby not to far off!
Your just feeling scared, it's going be alright. Lots of people raise kids off grid.. you guys are gonna do 👍
R those scallops amazing 🤩
Hey    spring   is just around the corner.
Hi, Nicolle! Hi, Jake! Even, Hi Nicolle & Jake!! Is there anywhere you've told your backstories? You were saying, Jake, you were raised there, to being 12, when you were taken elsewhere. And Nicolle, do you have any First Nation forebears? And what do you both do to be so focused and so calm? You are a great unit. I look forward to seeing your baby and wish you all a blessed & peaceful birth. Will you have midwife access in the Tropics? And when do you go there?
Ohhhhh dang !! Cliffhanger much
cánh rừng tuyết đẹp quá
Glad you both and the baby doing great. Best of luck and keep healthy.
I am just hoping you brought the dogs with you ...  As they are family too!
Best wishes on the next part of your journey. You will make amazing parents it doesn't matter where you live. ❤ Enjoy  the next part of your story, love and blessings sent 🙏
Happy New Years.  Did you guys move to Hawaii?
i know a family with a baby who live on a sale boat.  you have plenty here to raise a family....   it will work out according to how you choose.  You have choices... this place can become your seasonal location.  My daughter just had a baby.  Doctor visits and such.  then you have 4 years of doing as you please before School and scheduling.  This place will never disappear.
I think losing Longevity Gardens hurt Jake way more than we ever knew.
Hi you two peoples.. Who is going to look after your home when you leave for a time?
I luv the footage of u diving ...so beautiful and admiration for you holding your breath ...seal was so curious..luv it...
Don't worry Jake ,,, it will be wonderful to get back home and start really living for the future , just ask for guidance to do what's best  and it will work out fine , yay !  <3 The only worry I have is how to protect all the fruit trees from deer ?  And how to get all the food and herbs out of the house to deter animals from trying to get in ?  I wish you could get an experienced off-grid house sitter , they are out there !
I agree. You will return.  You are listening to fear within.   Do what you know is right.  All things go as they are suppose to
I m getting mixed messages ..and likely you ll straighten me out in this video ...You ARE RETURNING once baby is born correct?I absolutely understand the fear of leaving your garden ...I ve had to do it and never returned myself 🥺 I can't wait to grow and create a new one some day also .you are an inspiration💫
Jake, you say what happened if you leave there. Look at you in begin you at lost take a note that you have new baby dome home with you to live on those woods and one day going to look back when your wedding date there think that this is wonderful place that you both did the first three year with Nicolie might has the idea to be in town for the baby than come back to this place.
Couldn’t you get someone to take over while your away?  You could partner with someone and give then a couple of acres.  You could still post videos from both locations and come back to visit until your child gets older..  I’m sure many would like to live your dream.
Can’t wait to see you guys, and your beautiful baby!!!! Congratulations!!!
Wow! Talk about a cliff hanger!💗 I can’t wait to see where your tropical bug out property is. After hitting -8c last February and -13c in December, while living off grid, I’m so ready for the same solution!
Can anybody tell me when Jake and Nicole transitioned away from a vegan diet? Just curious, been watching off/on for a couple years now and don't remember the exact switch...
Get ta work wAmon ...make those Babies 😂😆😎
WOWWW WHAT A NICE CONTENT OF YOUR BLOG,ITS VERY UNIQUE.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS...
OMGGGGGG what an amazing twist. I've been watching you guys since the beginning (the van ilfe) and  now in the tropics 😮🥰😮 can't wait to find out where and what you will be building. Congratulations to you both. One Love from ON Canada 🇨🇦. Many blessing to you both in 2022.
I think it's a boy
Hey Jake ; I been hunting rock scallops for years from the coast of california on scuba and one tool you need is just a flat metal prybar to loosen the scallop from the rock and you can also just take the meat and inner if you use a cake spatula ,so you just scrape the very top or bottom to loosen the white muscle from the shell  from both sides and it is a perfect clean to not waste any bit at all , pulling it by force you loose pieces or chunks and the scallop meat gets some waste is the bad part; if taken the whole shell to clean at home then it is even easier to clean it with the $2 cake spatula (we call it the martha steward special ,they are long and flexible and contours to the inside of the shell to clean out the meat ) best tool to clean big scallops but many times if it does not fit thru the closed mouth then you need a good knife to brake the back black hinge first ,then scrape with the flexible spatula top and bottom to get all the meat... cheers and good luck with the baby , enjoying all your videos with your lovely girl !
WOW WOW WOW.... I was bracing for the sailing edition & NOW YOU'RE IN THE TROPICS!? You've thrown me through a loop! Love you guys and I'm super excited to watch the 2 of you as you grow to 3! Congrats on the new property and all your success!
That’s look like HAWAII 🌺
🙏🏼❤awesomeness!
First meal I've seen you share and Nicole was the star, umprompted
Your garden will be fine, it will come back. Baby is more important.
Happy new years and congratulations😊
You have your baby the way you want.  Don't let your man's insecurity change your mind.
I recently discovered this channel and have really enjoyed going back and watching your journey. I must be honest though you lost much of the respect I had for the way you live your lives when I found out you have an only fans page then seen so many porn videos of you two pop up. Not what I was expecting from the 2 of you.
I don't get it.  I would have imagines you both discussed the future and your plans.... if this is your home then why wouldn't you come back.   What does your childhood have to do with the control you have as an adult.   Yes it's sad to temporarily leave but ... what's with sudden weird talk.   Life changes, you adapt and your move forward.   Happens to all of us.  I think your over thinking everything; just let it go and take one step at a time and enjoy each moment for what it's worth.  The time will come when you return.   Besides, why can't you make infrequent trips back to check on things and prune or do whatever needs to be done; your in charge.
I have lived viacariously through you both, Im seventy now and not terrible mobile, I had to leave my apartment and return to my sisters to help with her care.  I loved my little apartment.  My heart is broken if you do not come back to you read home of heart and soul.  Much love to each and all of you.  Be well. and come back, Will
Thank you jake for shareing your fears and vulnerabilities...I believe there is such value in being honest about our shadow sides as well as our light🖤💟🖤
You could build the greenhouse after this will help you during the winter , best wish
I'm sure you both know how lucky you are to be on Van Island, far away from this pandemic BS. Lived there myself and forced to leave my love behind for family Selkirk Manitoba. Not a day goes by I don't miss the beauty, and it was like being on vacation everyday. Cheers.
Best wishes to both of you in your new tropical home. Tropical sounds like an easier life off grid.  I hope you will share your journey. Wishing you a healthy birth of your baby.
Your thumbnails are getting pretty funny now!
You stinkers, you went there! Great Video, good quality on all counts! Yikes, the sea life, those Scallops were amazing, seaweed too! Dogs did they go with you to the Tropic escape? Baby it is no longer Cold Outside! Where are YOU!? Happy New Year, God Bless, be safe, coming up on Baby day soon?! Clever end to the Video, I was on the edge of my seat. Thinking about how concerned you were for Nicole's safety, and all the rest. Good twist at the end. Awaiting the next chapter...
add castor oil to your rub
Please, do come back and continue. It won't be good to allow everything behind. lots of memories here. I pray you don't kill the beautiful memories. Bring the baby back to have a taste of this beautiful life. Happy New Year
Aloha, It looks like the new property is in Hawaii. Where the garden can be all seasons .
You will go back. You will be back before you even thought you would be. Once we have been in nature it’s too hard to do the reverse.
Sending you all of the best vibes and love from Ireland. Please God you will return to your paradise although it looks like you have managed to find yet another paradise. Can't wait to see the baby!! Huge Love and Hugs XOX
That was their filming studio. Their true home was never too far away
Loveeeee the pictures of baby moving ...I can remember so clearly
Good riddance
I am happy to see you guys going to a new place to ensure the safety of your baby but im sad to see you leave the place you have built into your home. Excited to see where youve landed and where this new journey takes the channel...
Stay positive and it'll all work out!!! Thanks again for sharing
Happy New Year to the three of you!!! I hope the next year is peaceful, happy, productive and adventures for all of you and from what is sounds like, it will definitely be the later, LOL! With all the talk about change I will admit I was not guessing it would be you moving to the tropics. Nope… not at all.  Like you said though, it is nice to have different places to call home, especially during this day and age. I know you will be interested in the different greenery but, being from the architectural business, I hope you have access to some Bamboo. You can make so many things with it. As always, thank you for bringing us along.
Looking good. Baby is really busy there. I make my own creams an so forth too. Keeping you all in my prayers. Happy New Year!
You must go with her! Go have your child together.
YEAAAAAA!!!!!! THIS IS GOING OT BE AWESOME!!!!!!!
May your new year bring you positive energy to guide you through the year ,. Hope to hear from you three soon , take care
Just great
Costa Rica 🇨🇷
Good to see you two soon will be three of you' get settled in and ready looking forward to the next video's with your new addition bless you and your little family.
Hoping that Y'all can get back to the woods ASAP! So much more fun to grow up in the woods than in a tropical  climate in my opinion. Best of luck on the Birth!
Omfg I'm so excited!!
Stay safe Nicole and Jake. I'm sure that we will see you guys back home soon at komorebi give yourself a month or two then bring your beautiful baby back there. Be such a amazing place to bring up. You guys are living the dream there.watching u both has really made me want to move to a amazing place like u guys where u get all sorts of weather and so my kids can play in snow. You guys are a inspiration for so many of us stay safe and happy New year guys
You can always live their by yourself dude and just pay child support like the other 60% of the population!🤪😢🤪
Amazing video good luck to your family on this new adventure thank you for sharing your lives with us look forward to future videos . Happy New Year 🎈🎈🎈
Said it from the  Start....its going to be a  Strong baby Boy ........Congrats.....
All the best!!!
Good luck to all 3 of you, see you when you return with your "little boy" in your arms!! I, along with so many others, will be waiting patiently!!
Diving in 0° for dinner! Nicolle you look great👶
Should of thought about your garden before you decided to not take birth control…can’t have it both ways I guess!
Love the channel guys. Do y’all ever wonder if there’s a squatch in them woods?  Jk!  No, but seriously.
Break out the coconut oil.... What - tropical you say.. love from Texas Bear
Did I miss the video where you discussed your transition from veganism to being truly adapted to the land you inhabit? Once again I am reminded of why there are no longer Norse Vikings in Greenland or Newfoundland - they brought with them their Viking ways which were not adapted to that land - the Inuit were successfully adapted to the land they were on and have survived there to this day. You are smart to recognize that. The bounty from the sea is not just for the dogs, the cats, and the garden.
enjoy  the travels ahead love you both
Where did you get your jean jacket? Levi’s?
I've watched you guys from the beginning ... From Phoenix,,, Please make videos of your journey throughout the birth,,, even if we have to wait till after the birth to see.👍🏼😘😘😘🌺🌸🌻👏🏻❤️ Love you both !
Happy New Year and many wonderful blessings with the baby. ❤🤗
Have someone caretake it until you return!! You guys are awesome. You will figure this all out.
Now that you've bought land in Kaua'i,  when will you need the sailing lessons?
I totally understand people's ideas of wanting you know the older life like you guys have got set up and then not have to use oil and other forms of transportation it sounds awesome kind of wish it was that way but same time that is also what is saved not only this country but billions of people brought them out of poverty of what used to be a king and serfdom situation that existed since the beginning listen to the Aztecs or you know the pyramid times so anyway it's been good and makes it easier for everyone to work now but yes ultimately it would be nice to have another situation like we you guys have got set up now would be awesome for everyone to be able to do but then the powers of the government won't allow that and most people won't allow that because then they lose out on being able to not only enjoy life but to feed themselves to f***** up situation
Home births are done a gazillion times, Nicole and baby will be fine. The midwife knows when to call in er folks, they can airlift you out.
Life is what you make of it and if you own it!! You will never have to worry of being pushed away from it! The Lord has you where he wants you! We all love and care about the voth of you even though Nicole's bell moves all over the way it does!! Oh yes Nicole I really don't think your dew date is right!! From your size you will have that baby in 2 to 3 week's!! Be carefull Love You take car!!! Lisa Guico
I embrace yoga breath work meditation self hypnosis nature my dog and protecting my peace. I’m an earth girl and desire to be oblivious to world affairs.  I desire to live more remote but not so much I’m too far from my family. I am Christian, I am finding strength peace and hope through the Holy Spirit. Without there is an emptiness no other thing or person can fill. Peace in the storm or challenges. Quiet mind.  I hear you, fear you won’t come back. I’ve experienced losses due to death of family removing me from the lake experience. But I am learning to be thankful I had those experiences instead of being broken hearted.  Good luck. Will pray for you and your little family.
Masha allah.. ur so bless..
WOW! Looking forward to seeing your new adventures! Thanks for sharing!! It’s so stunning, beautiful and informative!! Your reverence for nature is heartwarming!!
what about your pets? are they going with you?
Mate that looks a lot like Australia!
What? Oh this will be great. Now I see why Jake was scared.
What the heck?
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 I LOVE YOU 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 Rossana from Naples Italy  . big hugs and kisses !!!
Happy new year Jake n Nichole..I wish a healthy baby n joyous family ever
Hopefully you and your family will be there for many generations.
So Happy for you both . Congratulations on your new arrival 👏 ❤ Can't wait to see the baby in the cabin
Nice...
The phases of life change like the seasons of the year. Thank you very much and Happy New Year.  Until the next adventure guys.
Oh boy here we go again!!
You can trim trees when it’s freezing?
I have really enjoyed what you two are establishing. You will now have a new season in life, a gift given by all Creator God. Your child(ren) will grow up learning what your legacy has established, what most current humanity no nothing about.  The vibration 432hz is created in you with LOVE at the top. See you soon
С Новым годом Вас!🤗😊
So you put the mess in a forest to leave it and put the mess in another corner of the world. The human being in all his splendor ...
Happy New Year to you both and good health from Germany! 😘
Happy new year! What a wonderful new adventure!
How did she get pregnant?
That baby will have dual citizenship 🙂.
How did you get a shot if you diving if your the only diver,set it up with a buoyancy vest?
Trust NATURE - I had my first baby at 40 years young - at home as a fit yogini and talked with my body she and his body knew exactly what to do and did it all without me and my mind - we watched as they birthed all went beautifully - he is 16 now x
We miss you Happy New Year
I'd be getting a blue or red or a white wetsuit if yur near orcas,cu z, u look like seal dinner,but I here they'll spit you out!
vivement que " les petits pieds soient là " meilleurs vœux a vous et ceux qui sont chers a votre cœur , continuez a nous faire rêver ( sans modération ) amicalement
I'd be getting a blue or red or a white wetsuit if yur near orcas,cu z, u look like seal dinner,but I here they'll spit you out!
is so sad to here you guys leaving it was pleasure to watch you thanks for the amazing videos return so quickly take care and see you soon
Nicole sempre meiga e linda maravilhosa .💝💝
You need to take yourself out of that zone u put urself into and do what's best for ur kid and be around civilization during birth. A lot of things can go wrong which require MEDICAL intervention that even a midwife can't do. The place will still be there when u get back. If not ur, not the builder u think u are.
Why split and stack wood if this may be the end.
Oh my gosh I’m soooo freaking excited !!!! That ending 😂🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 YES !!
Oh neat! A sequel. Nomads had it right, warm climes during the winter, cool climes during the summer.
So sad to see you guys leave
Wife and Baby come first, safety for the baby always, it's to remote, if somthing happens to your baby, you need to be with in arms length of help, you still can live this way just  on mainland, think of that beautiful baby coming, be safe
Oh my gosh!! The best cliff hanger EVER!!! CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN! I love how u guys are so in touch with nature and the world around you both. Love it!!!! Can’t wait to see baby girl/boy
It is good that you're being honest with yourself. But much like all those beautiful things that have naturally found their way into existence maybe having the same faith about your emerging child would help ease your conscience, trust the journey and your wife's intuition. The Garden is alive and always will be. You may never imagine separating yourself from your seed, but yet you did.. you planted it and it is emerging, only to be found again. You cannot lose something you hold in your heart. That's fear (ego),not faith. 💜
Wow!
Pray you have a safe birth and return soon. Why would you ever think that you will not reture? That will always be home, it will call you back soon. Please let us know when and what when the baby comes. God bless you all three.
✨✨🌄
Where are your animals?
Happy new year,A $32,000 profit sent to my portfolio each week, Mrs Angela Regina Mende is amazing.
I feel you will have a beautiful boy. Congratulations to you both. Love your videos. Been watching for about two years now. 😊
27:30  belly kicks!
sizleri özliyeceğiz..
That's crazy how much that baby moves. I thought an alien was going to come out.
My journey was 1977 ( my only Child) ..yours is much better!!  GOD bless.
Everyone needs a tropical bug out location!
WOOW can't wait to see your new place, i love your journey. 🧡🧡
you do what is good for your woman and baby.. nothing else matters
Happy New Year!!!!!
Is leaving & starting again, the way?  If you keep running from yourself, you will never find yourself. Drifters never plant roots, without roots there is no balance, without balance, one is destine for fanciful flights of non committed relationships. If loose partnerships is what one desires, then by all means burn down your dreams and enter into the empty abyss of half hearted nightmares. The crossroad is before you, choose wisely young grasshopper, for dreams are precious & nightmares are a dime a dozen.
Tuna and salmon you can have
I don’t think ur post to be eating that when ur Pregnant
Wow.
Super glad you are going somewhere that you have access to help with the birth and for the baby if you need it. What happens to the yurt and property while you are gone? I know you are always concerned with animals getting to it. It would suck to have so much work torn down by bears and such while you are away.
There's been nothing posted to the following site in 2 years but I think you can use some of the info here:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA/videos
God Bless,Happy NewYears!!!
Be well and all the best for 2022... you have something special for you to look forward  to.
What a good cliffhanger. Awesome work guys!
You could keep it as your summer camp!
Where are You two headed next?

Can Johnathan keep an eye on the property for you?
Jake & Nicole....you guys have built together what I have always dreamed of.  God will always show you the way......You are where you were meant to be.....the place that makes your heart and soul happy.....never give it up.....you have worked hard for your little paradise.....a place where many people like me can only dream of......NEVER give up on it!
Blessings for your baby ❤️ Ying and yang will return ☯️☯️☯️☯️ what a beautiful story
@32:40 I cried a little.           just saying
היי שלום מישראל שתהיה לכם בהצלחה עם הלידה מקווה שתחזרי שלמים ובריאים
Wish you luck! Love you 3 guys!
Jake please take care of Nicolle and that little one to be.  I just watched this video and loved watching the baby  moving that is so special  take special care of the both  of them they will enrich your life beyond belief  !...!...!
Happy New Year........... I do not like battery chain saws, there isn't much go in them, unless you bring a generator Haha. Make you wonder what's going to happen when Gas free!!! They are stopping me using coal in a few Months! my house has been using coal for 119 years.??
Best wishes to all three of you, Nicole, Jake, and baby!  No chopping wood in the snow in the tropics!
You trimmed the trees while snow is on the ground.... Did they live❓
I have a question what breed are your dogs? They are beatiful.
BLESSINGS IN 2022 AND EXCITED FOR YOUR NEW ADDITION!
Boa noite 🙋amo assistir vcs💞bem que vcs podia colocar a legenda nos vídeos em português pra nós entender melhor vcs.beijos😘
It will be interesting to see where this goes, very cool idea.  Nice the 1m plus subscribers have afforded you to keep us entertained.
Very excited to be here through your next journey.  Sending hugs to you both from TEXAS.
nice ending
Feeling my child move in my belly was one of the biggest blessings in my child bearing years. Then after them being born I absolutely loved nursing!!. Now I am looking forward to being a grandma in March 🙌💕
Happy New Year. Happy New Life. I'm a very old man ((US Pres. 45&46 age range) My best friends wife spent 36 hours in labor in hospital. >>> My youngest daughter and my granddaughter came for a visit last week. That granddaughter was delivered (DIY) in the night, on a country road, under the careful watch of her 2 year old son, while her adult male went for a long hike looking for transportation help. That was in 2001, cell service is still bad in that region. Once your baby arrives . . . . . . . .
I love u guy but ur should have the baby in a hospital please think twice
Jake and Nicole, I love the way you love, I really do.x
Happy New Years. Can't wait till next time. God Bless.
They were able to flee the tyrannical situation in Canada and get to a tropical bugout place?  Many Canadians would like to do the same?
This is a really beautiful one. I love you guys, been watching since the beginning. I am 56 years old. And I just bought a couple acres. I am so inspired by how out door you get to live though I like to be warm as well. My home is warm, but I am getting a yurt for the back yard, may build a pizza oven. I am just really inspired by you. Cannot wait to see that pretty baby. LOVE LOVE LOVE
You guys have honestly changed my Outlook on life, on and off grid... Watching your journey together has been a true honor. Jake, dude.... You are a workhorse and all your work shows how it paid off. Nicole you are such a inspiration to everything holistic lol!! I wish you two the best, with the baby and life. Hope to see you back real soon!! Good fortune is coming your way. I see the balance between you.  Let me know if you need someone to take care of the place I could leave today😂😂.. You guys have my dream life!!  Thanks Jake and Nicole for sharing your life....with the world.
Happy new year!
Are you kidding me your child and wife are more important than your garden omg really
Wow! Beautiful. Peaceful. Serene. Hopeful. Exciting. And,...and.....a cliffhanger! Wow! I FREAKIN' CAN'T WAIT !!!! The next video please. peace y'all ♡
You can have anything in life you want. You just can't have everything. A child is a new journey. Bless it is healthy and you will find a way back!

[jawDrop]  What an excellent editing to reveal the new adventure. Congratulations. Looking forward to seeing this change.
Jake in a few years you'll have another helper and someone special to pass on all your knowledge. Happy New Year to both of you.
Oh that gave me goosebumps at the end, how fabulous for you.
Enjoy Kauai Hawaii! So much warmer!  It’s no secret when you can see the county Assessors website!! I sure hope you’re taking the animals!
Tropical sounds good. I look forward to your tropical adventures
Worry is a sin. Trust and believe in Jesus. He loves you. Your life is awesome!!! It will all work out....

Stuur berichtje als de baby er is
I am really sad too and I feel your loss and excitement at the same time . What you need to remember is that you are not alone with this pull away from what you have been living. You have received so many beautiful blessings....received them even though it feels uncomfortable now. Do not hide from it. Become well rooted and rounded. You are not giving up you are gaining something different for now. You know all things are for a time and a season. You will get to go back or visit in GOD'S TIMING.  This will be the perfect timing. God did not give you what you have established and worked hard for to lose it all. I know you will be back to appreciate and share with your baby the roots that have gotten you to where you are now. I have learned so much from the 2 of you on my short journey with you. You have opened a whole other world that is very real and does exist. You are a great man. You have so many wondrous abilities and qualities. Your wife Nicole and baby are very blessed to have you. You too are very blessed to have your wife. She is very much what balances you two out as one. Praise God. Together you can take on anything. One day and one step at a time. Love, appreciate and always remember to respect each other. I wish you ALWAYS the best this life has to offer. Love, welcome, teach and learn from your baby. It is your blessing and you are there's. Take care beautiful family.  Much love ❤ to you.
It’s a shame to see this come to an end. I’m so sorry for you she’s not strong enough for the life so clearly perfect for you. I sincerely hope your child will be the key to her growth.
Jake I don't understand I was reading that you are married and you and Nicole are not be together she has a baby girl and she when back to her ex I pray this is not true I love for you both stay together  I'm so sorry God bless you both
Happy new year xxx
Ik ga jullie missen sterkte Nicole xxx
GREETINGS  FROM  ALGIERS .
Dear Jake and Nicolle: You both and your animals have lived an enjoyed life. Is it different to live in a forest? Yes, but the quality of life that you have there is like a Life in a paradise. In a city right now it is complicated since these two years, you know what I mean. Both are safe and secure. Jake, do you need help on how to maintain your plants, vegetables and others? Look for Shawn James on His Channel for my self-reliance. He can help you with that. Do not despair! please be patient! you are strong enough!  you are creating a marvellous life there. hugs and Blessings for you five! Happy new year!
haha I never knew this couple does porn. Lost a fan in me for sure but wish them all the best.
Wow, I have never seen a baby kick only heard about it. That was awesome to watch.
Probably the hottest queen of the forest I've ever seen!!
Brother, you and Nicole are inspiring .I think it's a girl !! Yahweh bless you and yours my friend
oh my god... end of the video  gave me a excitement goosebumps ❤️
Your baby will be adorable 😍 💕
Can't wait to see you again. Good Luck in whatever it is you are going to do. I love you guys!
Happy New Year!!! Pozdrawiam z Polski 🇵🇱...🤓
what is this thumbnail?
😘😘😘😘😘
Looks good 🙂 Happy New Year to you and your baby.
Worry not... your plants will not die, they know you will return. Once you connect with nature like you have it can never leave you <3
That was a beautiful video and happy new year's to you🍾🍾🥂🥂🎊🎉🎊🎉👼🍼
Jake set your thoughts on the happiness that is before don't dwell not the past live each day as if it were your last.
Komorebi gone just like that!   This reminds of me of clear cut logging.  The earth requires the earth keeping commitment of those who inhabit it.  Where there no alternative to this choice? How about returning this now scarred property to it's near original state and than leave?.  Or is this just another causality of You Tube entertainment/profit motive  like "Naked and Afraid".   Had you not foreseen the challenges of childbirth and childrearing in a remote locale?   Would not British Columbia and it's beauty not been better served if you had never carved up the pristine forest  for a few seasons~ as a failed experiment of the ill informed.   This was quite jarring as videos go and contrary to the environmentally friendly and  sustainable message you have  been preaching all this time.  Makes no sense apart from video profit?  The price of self indulgence and poor planning   seems exceptionally high.
Not only will you come back.. you will come back in a hurry.. is what I predict.
No wayyyy.... devastating for us all.. to see you leave. Definitely return. You can have both.... THIS and the tropics. No one makes the rules in nature but you.... Have a safe last trimester. Sad but beautiful sharing <3 :'(
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🥱🥱🥱🥱💀☠️👽👻🙀👇👇👇👇👇👇
Nicole,  make sure to tuffen up your nipples. I nursed 3. A baby hairbrush works great. It will blow your mind how hard your baby sucks. Really helps to tuff them up beforehand.  Blessings for an easy delivery.
Looks like Hawaii
I'm sorry. You're leaving Komorebi why??? To go to the tropics? Ugh. What about the animals? This seems very odd. Are you doing it for ratings?
parabens nicole e jake, sucesso, sou do brasil, Rio de janeiro, sou inscrito no canal, e me sinto muito bem quando vejo essa forma de vida que vcs escolheram, felicidades para vcs e o novo integrante da familia, que ele venha saudavel e seja motivo de muitas alegrias, parabens.
So are we going to see u  anymore
R  U  guys leaving  because of all the work u have to do everyday
Omgosh… That shot of your baby moving in your bare belly in the opening credits took me instantly back to when my kids were in my belly 30+ yrs ago and how awesome it was to see them moving around in there… so special!  Thank you for sharing that with us❣️
Can I just say even trees have roots comoready is yours remember firtile ground sorry for spelling mistakes
Nicole be careful with the nettle leaf! Nettles have iron fiber which can cause damage/ or lacerations in your blood vessels unless they are young and tender.
WELL, THERE YA GO.
Watching babies move in tummies always reminds me of movie "Alien" sorry.
I would love a perspective thought from Nicole on her channel. Jakes opening is so depressing. Bless you both.
Watching babies move in tummies always reminds me of movie "Alien" sorry
Are you leaving the forest cabin forever or just for some time
Jake why don't  you have a caretaker maintain your property??????
God has blessed the both of u abundantly, an u take nothing for granted for everything that's given is not wasted ...u both use an god multiples...Your loved an gods blessings are upon you three...Lots of love little family much love stay strong....how beautiful life really is truly....hugs much love light
Why are you leaving this beautiful place? 😞
Possibly the best episode yet. Thanks for sharing your truth.
Are t there any hospitals around you guys ?
I loved this underwater footage! You could see the Seal or Sea Lion with their eyes wide open watching Jake's movements! Fantastic!!!  Well, Nicole is getting prettier every day! Jake is a very lucky man!  Bebe is strong because of the movements he exhibits around his belly! Onward friends on this journey of life...
I hope too see you back soon, may God bless you both and your new born baby.

Jake you show your love for this area so much. A wise decision to leave as first time parents and being so far away.   Think as it as temporary. Do not fear,  Fear takes us down. You will have many more years to show your child the extraordinary things that you love and enjoy in this region. Keep the faith Jake,  all will be well. Nicole is a strong woman, she will be fine. I look forward to the home birth with her midwife. It WILL be the most BEAUTIFUL birth EVER. I can’t wait. You are two wonderful people!! It will be the most Happy New Year ever.  Trust and have faith always!!
self absorbed drama king - 10 hours trip for the birth of your child or your so concerned for plant garden..truely pathetic - showing your manipulative colors.. As I have suspected this entire Journey watching that your true purpose of all the along the away was selfish that I knew now your tactics are exposed as to how you treat your true friend your ability to use people even your wife as a tool to get what you want  I've been done watching you for over 89 months because I can't take it anymore about your fake passion because it's all about you obtaining and getting something in return  You're very clear and transparent about your motives and what you do not so much what you say  King Jake desires worship that's not humility or Chi or anything else very disturbing and if I was your wife's friend I would tell her to dump you immediately  because you are a danger to one's soul sadly she is isolated in a remote place with the messed-up mental man clearly in it for himself appears to be a nice guy but deep within his rotten to the Core  I would simply tell Nicole to run now while she can
Shoot the deer and eat meat fellas
Nice ending. It would be cool to see a vid of the packing and traveling. Florida was a good choice ; low income tax xD
Having a boy? :)
Love you guys and happy New Year! But hey, don't move your scallops around in the pan. The browning you'll get my not moving them until it's time to flip is called the maillard reaction, and it will provide better depth of flavor and texture. Flip them when you start seeing tiny cracks in the browning coming up the sides. Keep the veggies away from the scallops while you cook them also, as the residual steam from the veggies toughens them up.
Hi from Chicago my wife my daughter and I wish you the best for you guys and your future baby,god bles you and see you soon happy new year....👋👋👋🙏
Dude is super weird
Looks delicious, so jealous
I’m so excited! ❤️❤️❤️ A new baby a new adventure this is gonna rock!
Where you guys going I'm gunna miss you guys have such in unpacked on me I love everything bout your guys way of life.congratulations on you new addition such a blessing
The greatest opportunity you are given in life is raising a child to know, love, respect and obey God's teachings. Keep this foremost in all you do amd he " will" lead you in the right path. Happy New Year and best of everything to your precious baby.
good riddance 😀
SUPER DANGEROUS ALONE IN THE WATER gw R REAL AND THOSE CLAMS SUC SHOOT A DEAR  BRO SAFER
Thank you very much Jake, Nicole for sharing the miracle of life !!  That was excellent seeing the human moving within the human stomach !! :)))  And hell yeah!!! I'll be there when you continue too...... and to.... and thru' the  KomoTropico Bug-out Property!!!
Don't give up this beautiful serene place. You can have your cake and eat it too. You can homeschool, or surely there is a school in town. Plan on that for your next property addition as well. Check out property that is a boat ride away, but close enough where baby can learn social skills with other children as well. This way you can give baby the best of both world's too. You just have to take the time to plan it. You have to plan ahead, especially with a child on the way. You may find this not as challenging as you may think. This makes for great research. I'm sure there are many others who have had this same journey. Gathering information from other's who have children and have chosen this life style, put it all together, take the pieces that will work for you and just like pieces to a puzzle, create your on life puzzle.                               I'm raising my Granddaughter, who graduates this Spring and goes to College next year. I presently have almost 8 acre's. I've lived here, since January, 1989 , that's 33 yrs ! I can't believe it. I've had horses, raised dogs, raised exotic birds, wildlife rehabilitation, rescued and taken care of so much. I have thought of letting the majority of it, grow back up, as I love being secluded and nature. It is a beautiful piece of property. I have always wanted wooded acreage to clear a spot in the middle for a home, with just enough cleared that's easy to take care of. I have been looking at properties in the central part of the State , where I'm from. I found 14 acres   , wooded and gorgeous. It has a ridge about the center of it. Perfect for a home and then put a pond at the bottom in the back. there is a road that winds around to the top of the ridge. It's so serene , peaceful and just beautiful. I can't make a purchase yet, if it's meant for me to have it, it will fall into place. It's about 40 minutes from my business off the Interstate. This makes it perfect, off the beaten path, yet very accessable to the main city. I am also considering my age. I'm a very active 72 yr old. I've taken care of this place almost completely by myself, and   22 yrs alone, also raising a15 mo old. I'm more active than women in their 40's and 50's. The parent's at school, ask me how in the world do you do it. I've always been this way, independant , determined and motivated. I'm 2 1/2 hours away from my business where I live, now. So it would be perfect !  i enjoy your video's and love this place. I do not like hot humid weather. I would love this area. Can't wait til your baby arrives, so excited for you. Spend as much time as you can with ur baby, they    grow up too fast. I've raised 2 and almost there with my 3rd. I'm so glad I've always been a stay at home Mom. I didn't want someone else hearing their 1st words, 1st time rolling over, sitting up, 1st steps. They   each went everywhere with me, but still had socialization at my friends daycare a few times a week. Wev'e  had so many fun times together. It's been an incredible journey. i wouldn't trade it for the world. You both will be so amazed how fast time flies by. Lots of pics n video's. Enjoy it !!
What a nice couple! Wish you a happy new year and lots of blessing with the new baby :)
21 weeks for me and I loooove dry brushing it feels so good when your boobs and belly are itchy then I use a natural body butter or oil and I don’t even care if it doesn’t stop stretch marks it just feels good
5 babies Amazing. you will  need some help with all that's coming your way
Can't wait to hear details about new property.wow
Nicolle  you are so lucky it looks like your carrying that baby low. Nobody will be kicking you in the ribs your last few weeks. Tell your beloved not to borrow trouble. You both will be back in your garden of eden way before breakup. Bring back lots of peeled logs. You guys will be way to busy for peeling logs this spring.
I can’t believe your leaving the life so many of us wish we could have
love the videos and really hope you carry on with you do, but please tell me you have the dogs and cats with you?
Happy new year 🎆🎊
You will never go back to your garden. Either the birth will change you; or your garden will change while you’re gone. Either way it will be different.
`Thank you for sharing Jake & Nicole,  I hope you are having a wonderful festive season. I look forward to the next adventure. Best of luck for the coming birth of your child. Stay safe, and take care. Greetings from downunder.
Yea Topics, Aloha from Hawaii! 😉. Wishing you safe journeys and best for the new Year. 🏝
One of my favorite memories of being pregnant with my daughter was riding on a bus and having a small child sitting next to me, seeing the wonder and hearing the laughter from the child when he saw my stomach moving. Things like that are what stay with you.!
👋👍👏🤝
Strange! Your monologue is a bit depressing though I understand it. Being a father is a life altering experience with many rewards and many challenges. I understand your fears of the unknown but humans have flourished in the unknown for millennia. Winter is always a challenge but you are well prepared. Your ending was a bit of a surprise but opens the door to another adventure. May you be blessed on your new project and may your new addition be born happy and healthy. Never forget just how blessed you both are.
Where is this place at anyhow looks like Washington State were im at
Wishing you 3 all the very best! Blessings
Its only temporary. Remember its no long you and your wife but it is also you child. One positive thing about the place there is you don't have to take you child to daycare before he or she goes to school. I guess the only thing to think about is how you child will interface with other children. Will it be via zoom or real life. I don't know how far you are from another town with many kids and schools. Just take one day at a time. Prepare for the days ahead, mind map many possibilities  and be prepared which ever way it takes you.
Happy New Year 2022 to Jake and Nicole and everyone associated to this channel. Hope fully it will bring joy and happiness to everyone, Nicole all the best and thanks for taking the journey to bring new life to this earth which only a woman can do. Many are living their dream with you two because what you are doing is great and exciting. God bless you three and rest everyone reading this. 👌🤙👌👍🤘🤟🙏🙏🙏🙏
So I can't wait to see your next video. Very interesting......you both are very loved. God bless.
Wish You Good Luck Of God's  Will In Your Life Happy New Year

What!!! Awesome! The ending was so cute… love it. Can’t wait to see what comes next.
احبكم ❤❤❤❤

FELIZ ANO NUEVO mis hermanit@s Siempre veo sus videos es una isnpiracion de vida para mi  de paz y tranquilidad bendiciones.
I was wondering what the plan was with a baby coming, stay in the off-grid or go back to civilization
Happy new year
See if your friend can come and stay at the camp and feed the cats go you guys
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Jake, you need to give your concerns and fears to God! Fear is of the Enemy! Go if you think it’s the wisest thing to do to safeguard your baby and Nicole. When the birth is over and baby and mom are deemed ready to travel…return! There is no better way to raise your child then to teach them the ways of Mother Earth. You have electricity, water, heat and clean air…do what needs to be done and come back!
Jake you’re only going to have a child wherever, it’s not the end of the earth ok
Good luck in this final trimester. I hope you're able to return quickly Jake, I can completely understand the heartbreak of leaving SO much work behind, but, may you both be able to return sooner than expected. What an awesome adventure you two both leave. Such a blessing. Praying for your safety through it all.
nicolle you are such a beautiful and feminine young lady even with a baby in you.
Muchas felicidades mis hermanos queridos por estar esperando su bebe mi abmiracion y mis respetos para ustedes tan linda familia saludos y abrazos con mucho carino desde aqui en California USA de uriundo de Oaxaca Mexico,Dios los bendiga sus vidas y el bebe, bendiciones.
You Guys!!!!! Always full of surprises. Never ending creativity....
I have thoroughly enjoyed watching your journey, and hope you will return with your new baby, but most of all, I wish you both all the very best as you venture forward in this next phase of your life with a child. How exciting!!
Eu acho que e uma menina❤🇧🇷
I love that you have decided to live 1 with nature but as you get older it won't be as easy to do things as you can now sooner or later this too will be part of who you will become
Love your channel 😊 I am 54 I have a serious question , Were is your child going to go to school and have friends to play with ?
Love the thumbnails, the nipple shilouette beating the censors make me believe in freedom and clickbait
Get 439 of your friends to join you and you can relish in the fact that you have successfully offset the carbon footprint of 1 Leonardo DeCaprio....for now.
You created a beautiful life for you & Nicole! Just give yourself time to know what is truly important in your life. It will come together!
You’ve done very well. To paraphrase a line from a popular film,”Your doing the brave thing”. To move forward and dare to leave it all behind…even temporarily.  Baby comes first. Venturing forth into a warmer climate is a wise choice. Thousands do it every winter. RVers call it Snow Birding. Enjoy the change.
You will build new gardens '💕
Amen to that
Have you/ya'll ever thought about connecting various pieces of metal outside of the home extending from the main furnace to create a free transduction heated-zone?

Feliz año nuevo bendiciones desde El Salvador CA
Yes happy new year Jake and Nicolle bun in the oven coming out soon. Natural birth at home wish you luck, as for your greenhouse have you looked into those Geodesic Domes i have seen a websites with people growing veges in the winter time all year round and have a fish tank in there too so the water from the tank waters the garden it is quit amazing. If I come across the website again I will give it to you if you want love what you two have done so far. Best wishes for you all and the new baby when it comes.
Loved the ocean footage I was raised on the west coast loved it all. You have to do what you both decide is right and make sure you’ll return to check on your garden and keep it a promise to yourselves❣️🥰🙋🏻‍♀️🙏🏻
Pretty Awesome guys!
Oooo...a cliffhanger...I love it!!! I completely see why it would be hard to leave Komorebi, but that little teaser at the end sure is exciting, and completely unexpected. Can't wait to see what this new year brings. Safe travels to you both as you prepare for the biggest journey of your lives, welcoming a new baby into the world.
In welcoming new life in the world...we have to do what we have to do..in the end it's all worth it..✌️🦋
God Bless you and Happy New Year. Human life that you created is more important than crying for leaving a garden which will always be yours. And since you plan on returning it will always be yours with the best of food for the little one. All of us have had to live through troubled times. With God's help, I wish nothing but a successful baby delivery. You will soon be able to teach all the valuable things in your son/daughter. These qualities, will live forever in your child (s).  🙏😘🤗🍼🧸
This is for Jake. This is about your wife and new child not you. Time to man up and take care of business. Part of that is making sure you return to your home after the joyous birth of your child. Play it safe Daddy!
Raise the child in that place. Given how so many are programmed, which we acknowledge in dogs, raising your child in nature can do more for the child than any system in society today. The energetic draw to participate in the programmed society today is all fear. It is feeding your personalities that are of values that are of no value. Men and woman need to learn to interact with nature again. Those children raised in nature may come to be the ones to lead the rest back. As we were told, we need to bring our ( false) heavens back down to earth and create heaven on earth. Life is here. our society today is the opposite of that.
This is too heavy! Why do you need to go back to the lower 48 and live in the rat race, Covid restrictions and insane political culture? You leaving social media and deep thoughts are obviously because you are getting ready to add this child to your life. Take it for me who lives in Oregon with three crazy ass kids. You are thinking too much and worrying way too much. Just live your life and be thankful for the shit you have in the remoteness that you have. The Coast Guard can fly to your house in 30 minutes to grab Nicole. Life is not this stressful.
Hell yeah!
This is the most wholesome video so far.
Your doing the right thing for the baby's sake. Your doing the adult thing to do. The Baby always has to come first. I know, I have four children.
☀️🍀🙌
You go girl i love what you guys are doing making things wow i just love it
Yes, it’s hard to leave your place behind, but it much harder to risk the safety of your baby’s arrival by staying back here during the freezing season with ten hours away from the city….. Life we never know, so please just take a very small step at a time to put your most priority first. When the baby about two months old, it’s also the spring time, it’s nice to be back to this place with the baby. Don’t you think so?  In any direction of your decision, I wish you all the best of happiness, and please savour each moment; instead of waiting for the whole picture to come true to enjoy…
Looks like Australia 🇦🇺..🤙👍
I have been watching your growth since the very first video. I realize now I grew with you as all your listeners have. Thank you for taking us along with you…My eyes are open just a little bit wider..A change is coming embrace it make it yours….
Hey Jake: Enjoying your sage advice~
This is just another season of life for you. Thank you for sharing with us all. I pray for a safe delivery.
Remember to be safe. Watch yourself for changes especially sugar issues. ❤
Life was put in place by a Holy Creator everything that has life carry this code.
Are you starting to doubt your stay in the wilderness?... With the baby and ALL.
Thanks for a little escapism for me and my wife , that being said, our childrens well being come first you're making the right choice
I love what you guys are doing i just wish i had a man could do this with or would so this with but anyway i know you to will find the way with your baby and wuth your beautiful place in my heart i know you guys will get through this together because when you got love you can do anything god bless you beautiful people love you guys
Gordon Ramsey would have sent it back because you slow fried it. Scallops you must quick fry hot pan.
I out almond oil on my belly and ended up with no stretch marks on my belly. BUT, I did not put the oil on my thighs.. and I have a couple of small stretch marks on my thighs. And I had two births.
When they get what they want what is usually a child . They change dramatically

This was so beautiful It literally made me tear. Sending you 3 very positive energy 🙌
Jake and Nicole my wife and I lost everything home jobs and the American dream life. Not ounce but twice,  our home washed out into the Atlantic in a hurricane 1985, took everything, including my business, yes we were insured but it did not cover all of our thing’s. But our family survived. We moved to Texas and started from scratch, had a small home a used car, and in ‘90 the entire neighborhood was torn up by a tornado,  we survived and with very little money rebuilt our third time and we stay safe and sound for next 31 years. Our family was always safe.
community makes one rich.
I dont understand why your leaving Paradise
Nicole…re-melt the body butter in a bowl in hot water, add essential oils, and re-pour into jars to firm up again.
The best hope is a healthy baby and Baby Momma. Tropical climes are good too and probably less labor intensive. But "Home is where the heart is" and Happiness is situational. My hope is you are all; Jake, Nicole, "The New Kid on the Block," and your cats and dogs, in good health and prosper! Happy New Year to you all and keep us posted on your latest adventure of life's journey. I hope to see this Canadian Wilderness Estate again, I would hate to see all that blood, sweat, and tears abandoned.
Ihr seid super 👍👍👍
You invested a lot of money and labor in that place. Are you going to go back there eventually, or did you sell the place? If you ever wanted to get a job, I think National Geographic would hire you in a heartbeat.
Rome wasn't built in a day! Stop that negativity if the garden will grow back or not. Jake you are sounding & coming off selfish. I see the stress, first child!  Nicolle with child is more important then any garden right now. Just do what you can for the garden and that's all, everything will be fine, the garden will survive. But you need to get on the same page mentally with your wife for her needs when baby comes. You are not losing anything you built for both of you, its not a dream, its called reality. You have gain so much and a change is coming, its call evolving with a new life & baby. I'm building a mini travel camper on a 4'X8' Frame, I'm 60yrs old. My journey is just beginning. I envy you Jake, only if I could do 1% in what you have accomplished. Live Long & Prosper, & good luck! Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day!
Hawaii?!?
Jake and Nicole, I hope the best for you and you are so interesting to watch. Please dont listen to the trash talk on this comment session. I will never understand tearing down people like this when Jake and Nicole have more than shown and educated many of us on their journey. You trash talkers have so much more to do in this lifetime than hurt people....Best Wishes and hopefully more Off Grid adventures with you both!!
Happy New Year😊
Amazing under water footage! What was the tempurature of the water? ~ 12 degrees?
Looks like you carrying a baby girl .girls sit quite high.. boys 8n the other hand hang low and your tummy almost rests on the top of your legs the bigger you get. In my experience anyway.
Like too ùany a jokeof fex years !
Your having a girl he slipped up…
Awesome stuff .
Tell the full reason for your move ....
Watch out, these pandemic babies are impatient to get here! My two granddaughters (diff mom's) both came Two weeks early, and their friend just gave birth Five weeks Early! Listen to Jake, and get closer to Civilization.  Your safety and the babies is not worth risking! Ten Hours by Boat??? Oh hell no!
Outstanding video, we are so excited to be on this journey with you. Thank you.
Dear friends, it is a great pleasure to follow you. I see all your videos from the very first you built your house. I'm italian. I saw the dish you made. I have a little advice. The pasta is overcooked. I recommend you eat it a little more al dente. It is certainly more digestible. Endless wishes for your baby.
Dear Nicole & dear Jake, Changing size of Nicole’s belly to a perfect shape of last months of pregnancy makes me feel joy and so much happiness for both of you to know in two month you become a wonderful parents with a lovely, healthy and lucky baby. After years watching your channel feel like you both are my children.   My husband & I have two wonderful grown sons and two wonderful grand daughters 8 & 4 years old,  my husband & I love all of them so much, they enjoy watching your videos too.  I hope remaining  pregnancy will go smoothly to be comfortable and be ready for a safe delivery.  Knowing Nicole for being so strong, young & athletic I’m sure her delivery will be so easy.   Nicole, is positive thinker, happy, healthy, strong, kind, caring, smart & beautiful person. These excellent personalities & attitude of Nicole have been helped her to solve all the up & downs in her past and present life.   Nicole, will be an excellent mother, she is so ready for being a mother.   Jake will be a best father and his strong Love Feeling Conection toward his baby will start the minute he holds his daughter or son.   Jake, does his best to keep Nicole and baby happy & healthy.   Love three of you just like I live my family. Hug & kisses. God bless,❤️🌲🥰🌹🌺🌲🤗❤️🙏🙋🏻‍♀️ Ellie, from San Francisco
Aren't y'all worried about your child seeing all the porn videos? WOW! And Jake never shows his face or speaks..its all on you Nicholle..he has set you up. He will get full custody  Wait and see.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hope to see your dogs and cats there with you- living their best lives as a family.
You are fantastic. Take care and take the vaccine.
Best luck for the new baby, you are going to be a wonderful parents. My love for you both ♥️
Cool 😎 episode again.... all will be fine 🙏🏻 Happy New Year
I think the idea of change is a natural progression for an adventurous soul. It's perfectly normal to seek a different environment when you're young or starting a new family. By every measure, you live in a paradise, and in the world we are living today for a couple to share a spot of paradise is akin to a blessing from God. I believe that you both will go off to wherever your heart takes you and return to this paradise as needed. Have a great time and grow with your exploring. It's not until you lose something that you understand and appreciate the critical loss of that one special thing. Have a Nice Day and New Year!
I honestly feel you’ll be back Jake your not losing anything your gaining so much more new land? And a new baby!!is just like to say Iam so sorry there are people in this world that feel they need to be so judgmental because you’ve choose a different life style than most I personally think it’s a beautiful thing that living off your land and all the things you’ve done keep it up many who can’t live off grid watch to live through your experience
33:07 OH MAN!!! ♥♥♥
Helicopters and float planes. 2 hours max to hospital upon first notification. I’ve worked in the area for years.
Be sure the herbs you put on your skin are not getting into your bloodstream...What we put on our skin especially if combined with fats, get absorbed. So do very lite amounts, not often, if those herbs could be potentially harmful or disruptive to the baby.
I don't think bringing back a garden would be all that hard..
I've really enjoyed watching your journey and growth through the last few years. I've been living through your dreams. But this episode really touched me. I understand completely how you feel about losing your garden and not being able to come back to it. As someone who has lost my garden several times. Hold on to that garden and Nicolle as long as you can. I think you'll make great parents living remotely. Both of you have built such good physical bodies and so nutritiousness life style. I think you need to be like the boyscout Jake is. Be prepared for as much as you can think of, and take a level head to just work the problem.           Don't stop making videos!!  Living through your dreams has gotten me through many problems of my own.  Thank you for sharing your life with everyone.  !!
Way to leave us hanging on the side of a cliff!!!! I love this land it reminds me of Alaskan land quiet an beautiful. I totally understand with the baby coming you want to be safe and be close to the comforts of the hospitals and Dr.s! I really hope that after all that work you did on this land you don’t   just leave it. Awe inspiring for sure!!!  With baby’s come changes. 🍼👣 I’m sure you will find your way back home after this Next Chapter.❤️❤️❤️
How awesome!!  Now that would be dreamy.  Will you be taking us on the tropical adventure? Happy New Year!
Wonderful to make your own lotions, etc. Medicinal grade essential oil can still be added Don't really want to put essential oil in during cooking process. Reduces medicinal effectiveness of the oils. Add few drops EO & stir in. 💚
Wow that is insane watching the birds at the end!
Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It will all work out…❤️ so enjoy your channel, Happy New Year… looking forward to your joy when you share your garden with the baby 😎🙏🏻
Love your dogs! What breed are they?
All that activity will make you think she's a boy.... but she's a GIRL!!!
Enjoy paranting you will be awesome
Sounds selfish, choosing between a garden and a baby. Let nature have her way and the garden can be reclaimed. Your baby's welfare is more important. Can't you know that. If this is the case, you are not as wise as you think you are.
Ace video. Will she be putting some new pics on onlyfans with the bump?
U guys are awesome
Друзья,это место  сейчас самое безопасное на Земле...учитывая нынешнюю политику всех государств ...здесь вы точно выживите, сидите и не высовывайтесь....потом поймёте в какую клоаку вы собираетесь уехать жить...уколят всех нахрен...и прощай здоровая жизнь на века...глупенькие..просто  гинеколога хирурга наймите и привезти к себе...всё равно они сейчас многие без работы сидят,не хотят вакцинироваться.Это будет  большая ошибка в вашей жизни, в других местах и странах уже становится опасно жить...
And, unfortunately, good and evil.
Happy New Year !
اتمني لكم حياه سعيده ونشاهد الطفل يطلع من بطن امه وهم في سعاده
All the best for the birth process. As a 60 year old who still loves renovating and building stuff I have marvelled at your energy levels. Please factor in that they don't remain that high forever. The focus of that energy changes as well. Cheers
beautifully shot and edited as normal, 10 hours from anyone is a risk factor. I hope you can return and continue your wonderful story looks like paradise in the summer months. All the very best luck can bring and thank you for sharing.
I knew you guys couldn't give up the millions per year....not when it's as easy as living and enjoying your life to obtain it!  Maybe we'll come off grid with ya in the warmer homestead.
So glad to have been able to follow you for the last 3 years. Has been an interesting journey. Wishing you a Happy New Year and the best to you both and your soon to be new addition. What ever and wherever the future takes you I wish you God's richest blessings.
You trust in nature well trust that you are nature. Women have given birth isolated since the beginning of time. Push through Fear and stick with your plan . Let Nicole trust her body and it will do what’s it needs to do. I love you guys and whatever you decide we support your decision. All will be well
I don’t know about anyone else but I feel like I just seen a movie that  left you at the  ending that keeps you guessing lol clever idea Jake and Nicole  😅 now hurry up and post the other video lol i’m anxious 😃
Lots of coconut oil on that belly ♥
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!
My husband and I have followed and watched your Channel from the beginning. We always looked forward to new videos. Whatever happens, just know your channel has made a profound impact on us, and I'm sure many other couples. We hope you all decide to stay keeping the channel going. And so looking forward to see the baby. Many many blessings and love sent to you both! Thank you so much for your inspiration you have gave in the last couple years. And wishing you all a blessed and amazing New Year!!! Love, one of your BIGGEST fans and subscribers!!! ♥️♥️💪💪🥰🥰
So are you coming back after baby comes.
You have everything, right there ,at your finger tips!!! People are working like slaves just to get to where you already are...stay there and raise a large family!!! I'm 33yrs, on my baby number 5, 5wks pregnant...and this is my dream, off grid living away from the draining western world!!!  New Zealand :) Don't give this place up!!!
So no more videos?? You guys are done?? Please let me know
Scenery is so amazing Jake and Nicole are building from scratch and using your talents too provide for and live off the land. Thanks for sharing and stay warm.
So that being said why are you leaving all that. Is it to have a baby?
Beautiful 🙏🏻♥️
In your solitude, stop and regain your perspective. it's hard to hear your defeatist mindset, speaking of your fears. There are always solutions, there's no reason you should have to give up all you have worked for. What about volunteers, friends, family,who share your lifestyle and beliefs, as temporary caretakers of your home and garden's, and pets? Do not give in or up! 💜
WELCOME  THANKS. HAPPY NEW YEARE  DEARE FRİENDS.. GRACİAS ..OBRİGADA..
this child you have made like your garden together
21:14 I love these milk tanks
Best of luck and be safe.
you must go and come back bring your child back and let it grow up in this place but you must think of your child first and foremost ken from kent england
Happy New Year 2022 Boy or a girl ?? Congratulations
Jake is pregnant too? WTF? NWO, with our arogancy we are now the God.
You could see how excited & eager I was to see Jake bring out that big  🐟 out of the water but damn....😁
Not me crying at that ending ! Oh I hope and pray to the gods y’all will go back to your forest when Nicolle and the baby are good to travel ♥️♥️♥️♥️stay safe!! Lots of love and appreciation!!! And happy holidays !! ♥️♥️♥️🥺😭♥️♥️♥️✨
yuck
This is why you should never get married. Very Depressing-:(
I feel duped after I saw someone say to google Nicole and only fans…..you guys are into pornography. Like wow……
your both properties is a sanctuary never leave please you 3 are billionaires
La mulți ani și un nou an fericit....!!
Happy new years  can't wait to see your beautiful baby and the adventures for 2022
Loved it all !  Excellent job
Come live here in Costa Rica 😍
I didn’t see this one coming! But the journey has been incredible! I’ll be coming along for the next chapter! Happy New Year!❤️
Hawaii? Vast difference regardless of where it is at. Happy New Year.
Life is all about God ,Jesus family and friends ❤ 🙏 Happy New Year 💖
My very best wishes for a healthy baby and mama; God bless you all❤️❤️❤️
I get you don't want to leave but it would be a very good idea to be at a hospital or close by just incase. Don't you have a friend that you trust that can take care of your place including the gardens while your gone ??? I wish you very good luck !!!!
why are you chopping down trees for fire wood when your not going to be there
Awaiting the next leg of your journey. Thanks for taking me along so far. Peace and pleasure my friends. I’ll see you on the next one. Peace and Joy, love and light. Stay safe and in the blessings. ❤️💛🖤💚
Jake, you have used the wrong word to express your feelings.  An individual who is strong, sure of himself, and in control as you are, is never "afraid"; but concerned.
I'll see you again in a while: I just wanted to wish you a happy and peaceful year in which you will find new life that pushes you forward in wanting to be able to face everything together 🍀🌹😉
You all I wish a very good new year and a good new start with your soon born baby.  Jake your bathtub outside drain it otherwise it will crack due to frosttemperature, frozen ice expand. All the best and strength to you.
This seems very staged for dramatic effect...the conversation staged, the situation staged.  Just because you go to the mainland to safely have your baby why on earth would that mean you will lose your garden and your home?  Just do what you have to do to have your family and get back to your life.  No need for fake drama.
I knew these people couldn't really live there all the time.
No way A tropical bug out property That is so freaking cool
Dear Nicole and Jake and Baby.... The song I mean for you to listen to is called "Ajeet Kaaur..Kiss the earth....or....Earth Prayer. "          Sorry I am not very computer savvy, with my sincerest gratitude...Kellee Stroia
Anyone know where this next location is? Really realky curious about it!!😆
Best of luck to both of u
I'm happy your starting this new leg of your adverture just wondering what will happens to the current property will you guys sell or keep it?
Wow, I thought it was a joke when I saw a comment about you two selling porn on OnlyFans, and you actually are. Jake, you have espoused so much about 'martial arts' values and morality over the years, and you resort to selling sex videos? I have followed you for years, and always gave you the benefit of the doubt when people called you a fraud, but you clearly are. You call yourself a martial artist?
this is some deep thought shared with millions. Thank You .. You are not alone in the beautiful struggle.
That boy will come to a great place and good people! Trust nature, the universe and the energy that is all! Happy New Year!
What a sweet man! …. And a smart man… remember …. What you’ve created in the past can be created again. The physical world can always be replenished.
Happy new year 7m wow, winter look so good in Canada
I am sitting here thinking about you and your bundle of joy to come and I just started crying because I realize your round about due date is my recently passed baby sisters birthday and your baby is going to be amazing please, please be amazing to her, yes I know my past comments say I think your gonna have a boy but now I don’t think that anymore. I now know why I have had the dreams I have had about you.
Happy new year!...I love scallops, crabs, oysters, clams, hailbut, green lingcod, red snapper and salmon!...had them many times when we lived in Tofino...thanks 4 video. be kind.
Love you guys!
Falta un invernadero todo lo demás está bien ,,mucha nieve no se ven los colores  de la naturaleza solo blanco 😀🤟 saludos 🇺🇾❤️🇨🇦😀👐👐
God bless you both what a wonderful couple you are and baby makes three.  Good luck can’t wait to see you and your beautiful baby.  Love from across the pond. ♥️♥️
So stupid how you sexualize   your videos thumbnails. Show’s you’re boring little man. Probably jealous as all fk too. Poor lady I feel for her
all the best with your new season!!
Happy New Year with lots of blessings
I’ve been with you both thru this adventure and enjoyed you both and those precious dogs. Your future in raising that precious baby will be the biggest endeavor ever. Good luck in your life beyond.
Wherever your life takes you, know that you both are loved. I hope we get to see the baby. Please take care and I do hope you get to come back to Komorebi. I may have spelled that wrong.
Hope you enjoy where you are . And be back in spring with your beautiful baby.  This vlog was a beautiful one . We will miss you and know you will spend the time with each other and new baby.  Your new journey will be amazing
Happy New Year to you both....I can only imagine how tough it must be for you to leave it all behind.....but trust that God's opening a new and hopefully much better journey for you, soon to be three, to experience....thanking you always for sharing your awesome videos...
It's been freezing! Sure gonna miss u. I hope u give us updates. U have been part of our lives for years!
Feliz ano novo Mir de bom pra vocês....
I didn’t learn about your porn till I read comments I wonder if child protective services is going to come in that would be reason to up and move to tropics I feel sorry for your kids
You both have an amazing Aura,more so being with child!! It makes me sad to see you leave your happy place,i sure hope you come back, such a shame all the hard work you both have put in to your home stead!! Just to leave, doesn't make sense to me!! But you have to do you!! I like many others have watched and enjoyed all the videos!! I have a heavy heart and some tears.. Whatever you choose to do i and others will watch faithfully! Thanks for the Amazing adventure you have shared!! Stay safe my friends.🤓👍🤓👍Randy.
Fear not my friend. That voice you hear is leading you to One who is life eternal, and who loves you with a love that defies understanding.
God Bless you all three of you and may you be further blessed with a wonderful New Year
It's always going to be there, you are just on another journey.  May not be planned but it is real and you must think of him/her.  I'm sure you all will be back.
Wow I am so impressed by how nicely the pregnancy of Nicole evolves. What a nice cute intimate couple moment to hear the heartbeats of the baby, truly unique! I respect so much their way of going through this as raw as possible, letting the pregnancy to just be. Without too much tech involved as most likely would have happened if they would have lived in a big city. I wish you both lots of fun in the new parenthood adventure, God bless you🤗
Спасибо за видео 👋👍🙂
Amazing to watch and feel with you your daily life, how you manage with living off grid in balance with nature. I am impressed how you also handle pregnancy and prepare for the baby, so relaxed and in peace with you and your environment. I wish you all the best and will follow you further.
On the siphonophore @ approximately 10:57-11:16 are those colors generated internally or is that just the way that light plays off of their bodies ?
🖐️🖐️🖐️💕🇲🇽
HI , when you all going to fix the landscape :)
Coquille st Jacques is very good ! 🤩
A Happy New Year to you both and best wishes for your exciting journey to come.
I was about to pounce on the choice of healthy mom and baby or trees.  But then I saw the ending.  I’m so glad you made that decision! Nichole I wish you the very best with delivery. My only advise. Find a focal point and breathe mine was a square tile on the wall below the clock. And just remember the pain is temporary  keep telling yourself that while you’re going through it.  All my love
What did the I-Ching advice/guide you 2do? Jake?
Much love to the three of y'all!
That town that is 10 hours away may have a wooded area. Get small parcel with a  1 1/2 bedroom Cabin near town,walking distance. Can live basic there too. Best of both worlds - Ying & Yang Homes.
Worry won't help, prepare, plan, focus on what you can do.
Good Bless And Happy New Years 🍾🍾🍾🥂🥂🥂👍
I never knew about the fans only page until now I went and looked unless I pay 50.00bucks a month I can’t see the pictures of course but just reading the chats she’s leaving is making me sick ,,I loved these kids and what they were trying to do…I’m unsubscribing no wonder she was always half naked in the thumbnails…and to think I defended her…
Best of luck to you  both. Love watching  your videos. Happy New Year !! Congratulations on getting ready to have your new addition.  Take one day at a time. Live happy!! Have a healthy life together  and cannot wait to see a baby girl or boy.   Take care and praying for you all.
Hi Jake and Nichol, Happy New Year. I  loved what you said in the intro of the video Jake, it was deep and poignant. You are a man about to become a father with a great relationship with Nicole and a huge responsibility. You have to make choices in life for yourself and your family. They won't always be the best. I believe you will do your best to try to make the best choices. I have great respect for you. What you said, Nicole was exactly what I said to my niece who has a two-week-old baby girl. I have always felt that way about the human body, the woman's body, and the magic that happens inside the woman's body when it comes to conception to birth. I have three girls and one boy and to this day am still fascinated by the magic of pregnant women. I am very close to my children from 30 to 12 years old. I believe you both will make wonderful parents because you both understand that you don't know what you don't know and your mistakes will be your best teacher. Keep living your lives to the fullest at the moment. Peace.  Earl
I have throughly enjoy each show. You both are amazing souls. May your new journey be blessed and healthy Baby. Look forward to new beginnings for you both. Happy New Year!!  Your child will be so blessed to experience the love and knowledge and lifestyle you live and share with us all.
Good Bless and Happy New Year 🍾🍾🥂🥂👍
Tebrikler. Nice Yıllara sağlık ve sevgiyle..(Google Translate:Congratulations. Happy New Year... with health and love..)
Спасибо
Happy New Years . Nichole please leave the sea food alone until after you give birth, its not safe. JS  trust me it causes birth defects......
You are so lost in your chi you can’t understand that NONE OFTHIS IS PERMANENT. Life is the journey, not the destination. That probably sounds just as cold as we will all will be in the ground someday because it is. The warmth is in the love while we are here and what we leave behind.
Happy New Year Nicolle and Jack 🥳🥰and also special happy wonderful life to your beautiful baby boy 🥰🎊💓
Вы как мои дети, дружные и трудолюбивые. Живете в красивом месте.Люблю вас. Украина.
I’ll look forward to seeing you both along with a precious little bundle in the spring. Hurry back!  Until then, enjoy the new life.
Suggestion - Winter home closer to people - Summer (Komorebi) , best of both worlds. Other people in US do it (2 homes - summer & winter). Ying & Yang homes.
What is the reason for leaving. all that work hope you dont abandon your home the pioneers made it you can to
It's Yin and Yang, not Yin and Young.
I DONT GET WHERE YOUR GOING WITH ALL THIS STUFF YOUR TALKING ABOUT, YOUR WIFE IS HAVEING YOUR BABY , THATS THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD WORRIE ABOUT , NOT YOUR GARDEN OR YOUR TREES , YOU MUST OF MADE HER FEEL LIKE SHIT TALKING TO HER LIKE THAT, I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER THAN THAT , BUT I HAVE SEEN YOU LIVE AS YOU WERE ONE AND NOT TWO .
I think you over pruned your young fruit trees . I would have waited for at least 5 years and or only taken a few whips for more trees. Over pruning to soon stunts fruit growth/production. Seafood good !
Happy New Year 🇳🇱👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🍀☃️☃️
32:37 EPIC
No mater what it is it will be ANGLE,BOB in OK.
Tropical! Of course! 💕🙏💕
I think you guys are doing the right thing for now, taking care of mum and baby. That doesnt mean the dream is over. Have the baby do the baby thing and when the time is right come on back. Employ some help for gods sake . Get the place working , moving , building. Build a town a city whatever.  Keep the dream alive. Never give up the plans just include some care in to it for little people. Remember little people grow up and fast.  May the force be with you.
Don't give up on the place you really will come back with your beautiful family
Happy New Year and Blessings coming!  How exciting on new bug out 😂🤩👍🏻 can’t wait to see this adventure!!
Awesome!!! Looking forward to your next adventure ❣👍💞
Was awesome to watch. Wow. I just can't say enough about u both. And can't wait to see the little one. Ur gonna be great parents. Enjoy each other. Happy New Year. God bless and stay safe
😱😱Spectacular & beautiful mom!!!!
Put your faith into God he has brought you this far our ancestors before us set up on the same aventures and they made it and so are you
My heart aches for you both because of the decisions you have to make, all for the safety of mom and the little one. This decision to leave is necessary, but your viewers know how passionate you are about your home, how much hard work was poured into it to make it what it is becoming. Perhaps taking this necessary break from that location, and spending time in a new one, will birth new ideas, goals, and widen your scope of looking at the world...and when you return, you will come with a new framework to build on. Parting with something you love is so difficult - may this next stage of your lives be fulfilling, joyous and illuminating! Brightest blessings to you three and your furry babies. Onward!
Happy New Year!
Nicole já sabe se é menino ou menina.
Wow you guys are just running away unbelievable wow well I guarantee you guys will not come back if you read the Bible God said in Revelation that plea to the mountains I don't make your in the winter time you're getting there you are awesome and there it is so sad when you guys have to pick up and leave amazing so you guys have a good Adventure can't see it with all what's going on the world see we're better off in the Vancouver Island I'm giving you hope and pray and I'll just tell you you were actually safer there where you guys are going to go next
Nice to see you both again, and the progress of your pregnancy. Listening to baby's heart beat is a wonderful experience. We know you'll be moving away to a warmer place, as you alluded to in the video, and show us a glimpse at the end. We know you do the videos as you see fit. It would be nice to just say up front what your new plans are, but I guess we wait like excited children on Christmas Eve to see what Santa will bring. Best wishes and a Happy New Year.
I so love this because I love your Chanel, but to see you guy’s in a climate more similar to my own is going to be great to see the ways you all use the flora & fauna to build this new location. Blessings on your little one & new journey
Boa tarde amei o episódio Deus abençoe vcs.
This is the time for your garden to rest and get ready for another growing season.  Don't worry about everything so much.  It's negative energy you don't need to dwell on and baby can sense it too!
Happy new year to you both, and waiting with love to your baby get born. one million love from Sweden!
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU AND YOUR BABY SOON TO BE BORN
I PREDICT ''IT'S A GIRL ''
I didn’t realize you guys stoped being vegan. Very sad to me.
Hello Jake..Nicole..and new baby, a girl named Elocin..or a boy named Ekaj. I am crying now, because new adventures also bring forevermore life memories.         Keep on loving,           Kellee Stroia
Prune the trees now so they will be ready for their Spring Awakening. By then the baby will have arrived and you will be back. Work the gardens then. Life can be good between two places! Bless you both and your new bundle of love!
Happy new year Jak & Nicole. I’m going to miss watching your videos. I’m a 65 yr old lady that s confined to my apartment .  So watching your videos make me very happy. I no longer am able to go out  I totaled my car and I’m to poor to get another one . So I stay inside all the time and watch off the grid videos . You are my favorite . If was still  young I would do it your way . So much about me . You guys better!! Come back soon and with a healthy baby 2 dogs 🐕 & 2 cats 🐈  I love watching you  all 😍🙏❤️I will pray for a safe return to come komorebi. 💕
You are a smart guy..The safety of your Wife and child should be your first concern...See what happened to Trent and Allie. You can return where you left off.......Not and end but an extension...
Herbalist here, that tea is perfect! stick with that blend! Now the balm, best to keep it plain, add some vitamin e oil, be careful with topical essential oils during pregnancy they absorb into your bloodstream, and stay away from licorice root.
I pray you will be able to go back to your beautiful land and home.
Maybe moved into town a few weeks before her due date. There’s no reason you can’t continue to live there. Why would you give up your dreams.
I’m really really sad... loved this place ever
Tropical Butter Puppy Ha Ha who made that up?
You said you were trying not to cry..You of all people should know its healthy to cry...One chapter closes another opens....
I knew all along it wouldn’t be safe to raise a child there too many bugs and having a separate house/with wood burner in it for a baby and I’ve read being so damp worry about mold. It seems this decision was made so fast. Good Luck
Awe so this journey is ending but another great one coming!  So happy for you all!  You guys are awesome to watch so I’m looking forward to 2022 and your fabulous adventures and of course with the baby!!!
Firstly, Happy New year Jake and Nicole, all the best for 2022 and the new life of your Baby, Can't believe it's 3yrs you've been here, I like most will be sad to see you leave, Jake, your raised beds inspired me to build my own, I thank you for that, You have to do what you both feel is right for yourselves, Jake, An old saying, Never say Never, you will go back , yes things will have changed that is life, Where ever you both end up, Enjoy life to the full, You only have one shot at this, Will you be taking the Cats/Dogs with you.Hope you are. Thankyou for sharing your adventures, until we meet again , Stay Safe, 💖💖
mermaid search!
All the very best to the three of you, you inspire young and old alike :)
You need an interim caretaker for your garden.  It has been said for a reason “it takes a village to raise a child.”  Jake, whatever project we start in life we may not see finished, garden, forest hideaway, great grandchildren.  We are only here as material beings for a limited lifetime.  We have to prioritize what is worthy of our attention along the journey.  Some things we must leave to others, for their growth and experience, and maybe return to input new life into the project later on.  Our purpose is not to possess any place or thing, as these are removed when we die, but only to grow from our experiences and to share loving moments with those we are allowed to treasure here.
Connection with God ends all fear. That means connecting with all of God's creation, especially those you have grudges against. Forgiveness opens the way to freedom.
It was hard to wait two weeks for a video! Now thinking of longer than that, is really hard. You have worked your way into our lives, you have become part of us. I totally understand and hope the birth goes well, but know this, you will be sorely missed. Have a wonderful new year!
Truly epic ending to this video! Can't wait to see what's to come
Happy New Year!  Wishing y’all all the best in 2022.  I look forward to ur videos and hope they don’t stop.  Can’t wait for the little one to get here and y’all start ur new journey.   My daughter is due anytime now with a little girl.   Her name is Olivia Faith!   Blessings to y’all!
Happy New Year to you  and say to your baby Maşallah
The ending tho …… come on I can’t wait !!! 😫💕
😉😉👏
Happy New Year Jake and Nichol.
Lovely weathers
Thanks Jake and Nicolle for this beautiful message and video. I guess this feeling of isolation is everywhere now. Sometimes it’s a sad feeling, but hang on faith, hope, knowledge, and love. Trust your instincts and your knowledge, and love. In the book of Ecclesiastes, we find a message that says that there is a time for everything.  You both are wise folks. Be well, and God bless you and your families. Happy New Year! Your garden will smile to you again.
OMG I love this: 2 completely distinct climate properties to develop and grow, and sailing life to get from one location to the other... WOW, what a vision! What a life!
Hi OK OK 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
The most beautiful couple happy new year to you
People  have had babies for millenia...you just ate roe
Many attempt such a life but very few finish, most go for a few months and 10% maybe a few years? But 1% to 5% have the courage and ability to finish their lives in such remote lifestyles. Its not a critical statement but the truth, that life I've lived, its a hard life. I'm disabled now my health wouldn't allow me to finish. I'm on dialysis and now I have cancer, I cry often because I wanted to finish so many projects and I know its not possible.
I am a little bit confused... Although I respect your choice. So much efforts and daydreams. You both made a really good visual story and way of living. And now it is just behind. To some extend it is unfair. But you know better what is good for you...
Sorry Jake and Nicole I didn't get my happy Merry Christmas to you sooner and a better New Years that lies ahead may you be greatly blessed
Man, you are not going to loose anything.  You do what you want to do.  You make it work together.  You make it work.
HAVE A NICE DAY VEGAN ATHLETES!  IS VEGAN BABY HERE YET?!
Will youse be back after baby comes I will miss your videos.BOB in OK.
This is amazing 💙 ..... Diving... sailling lessons... Vancouver to Mexico?!
OMG ,i don,t belive it ,why do you leave so fast i hope you will coming back to be living like this some day GOD BLESS you two
Will your sailboat have a diesel engine, gas outboard, a gas or diesel generator, etc.?
Привет вам из РОССИИ
Excelente experiencia submarina, felicidades, me encantan sus vídeos, dios bendiga su familia, feliz año nuevo! 😊 desde Coahuila México.
You can't leave us hanging like that. Tell us more about this tropical bug out property.
عامكما سعيد و كلّ سنة و أنتما طيّبين
Hi, I'm new to your channel. I noticed that you only have one cat now. What happened to your another cat?
Happy new year, I am sure you will return but for now your family comes first ❤ good luck you Two and counting the day's for the new arrival 😊.
The greatest gift of all is love,and you have shown your garden a lot of love. Now it’s time to take care of your most valuable seed conceived in your beautiful garden and to be raised running around with the dogs and foraging in the woods with mom & papa. God bless you ❤️🙏🏼💐
Hepinize sağlıklı mutlu huzurlu senelere diliyorum
I’m confused! All your planning included a baby being raised there, I thought! Nursery bunkie? So why all this reflection of it all being a dream? And leaving? All this type of talk to me, would make Nicole feel bad for being pregnant!  Not so sure Jake ever wanted a baby!  Be supportive of Nicole and the baby during this time!!!
What a wake up call . Nichole I wish you the best , I feel you r having a boy . And I love you guys , took me a while to understand you both . Jake , I am learning Tai chi . It’s so amazing how I am feeling transform . Jake you are amazing , my husband love doing Tai chi as well . It really doe balance you , I can’t explain it . Good luck to you both and your unborn child.  Lot of love ❤️
Happy New Year...Love and Blessings from Colorado, USA
Thank you both
I struggle to think of someone ever saying life is a destination but countless times I have heard life is a journey.  if your struggling to compartmentalize this choice to leave and start anew in another place of wonder and enjoyment I say what I think about when I think of loss (in general) remember the times you had there, remember the smells, sights and feelings of that place and know that you will always have those no-one can take them from you.  But don't be afraid to make new ones in new places with new beings.  Love the journey love the choice love the people love the moment.
Happy New Year 🎊.   I’m sure y’all have a beautiful birth and you’ll return soon! 🙏🏼
I will miss You so much.
I just transported to another time, another place. I need to visit my daughter in Maui… Am I there yet?! This is exciting to see!!! 😍
Happy new year 2022
Best wishes to you and your families. Thank you for the inspiration you provide to your true followers.
Start over. You've come so far!
Wishing you the best. Happy New Year! 🎇🎇💕
It will be ok . 🤜💥🤛
Fucking brilliant 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
happy new year guys
Thank you for sharing your love, your skills and your values - your ethos. You're a wonderful example to us all! I look forward to seeing more of your videos as you move to a more hospitable climate.
Sending love and blessings for the new year
Poor content and an overhyped title with no real explanation. Clickbait is what you do best
I've been in tears this whole video because I'm so happy for the two of you . This baby is going to bring you both so much joy and happiness. Happy new year! You will go back ! And thank you so much for sharing your life with us. Sending love and prayers all the way from Utah God bless you and the baby.
Awesome 👌 👏 👍
Woow
No cold for me. TROPICAL always. Looking forward to your next adventure!
💕 Happy New years 💖❣️

Happy new 2022!
Looks like you carrying a girl
💖💖💖
С новым годом прекрассная пара дой бог вам всего самого наилучшего
Nicole you are truly just beaming .your glowing .
Hey Jake do it for the money....when you think it's time for your little one to start to socialize then make the move if that's what is desired at that time. Your like a cat u and Nicole no matter how you get dropped you will land on your feet. No quit being a crybaby and go cut split some wood.
Looks like boy.
Save tree for better environment and next generation
I wish you a good new year. Health, joy and love. Wishes for you from Russia. You are a wonderful family!:-)
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👍
😊😊😊👍👍👍❤️
Wishing you all a very happy and healthy new year.  I have been watching your channel for a long time, you guys are very creative and in harmony with nature.  Wish you two quickly have a new member 👍🏿
I think Nic would like some tomato bisque 🍅 too there Jake
Watch some of those herbs while pregnant could be toxic to baby. However orange 🍊 juice is great for brain development it is water soluble so you can’t over do it
Какие классные ребята восхещяюсь их трудолюбию природой в каторой они живут я незнаю английский но смотрю все с большим удовольствием и хочу увидеть бебика благодарю за этот фильм
When a baby is born?
Linda 😍😍😍😍
Don't forget.. you create your reality by thinking. If you want to go back or stay, visual what that looks like and hold onto it at every moment <3

Everything will work out .
Love your belly.❤️
Yes awesome journey so far so much for everyone to see them working more and more than most people peace and love to all of you
sometimes this guy is so full of himself!
Hi Nicole! Congratulations on being 7 months pregnant!! Take care yourself
🌲🎁🎁👍🏿
👏👏👪
Yummy. Looks delish.
Saludos.amigos.los.veo..desde.Honduras
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
You guys are a great kids who's leaving a full fuel life, gain an amazing  experience . I'm sure I'm not the only one who learned a lot from you. If I can hold you back and never let you go, I would.
Those scallops look delicious. I cant wait to see what the tropical bug out location has to offer. Happy new year and cant wait to watch your next journey through the rest of your pregnancy.
Thanks for sharing with us of your organic life. Just remember that this beautiful place of yours is waiting for the three of you...good luck and God bless.
Jake, I have been watching you since you had your garden in Arizona, and been thru it all.  So much love to you and your family.  Balance, Wholeness and Harmony, friend.
Всех с Новым Годом!!!!!!! Всех благ
Happy new year and blessings for baby and family 20.22
So Beautiful Under the Water there !!🌞 Thank U!! Congratulations On U All Baby!! U All will B Back!! Love what U All have done on the Homested!! Love & Peace!! 🕊💕🌹💖
You have another home...your main home to go to. Not sure what you are talking about.  You film there and play there... but you don't actually live there. Friends of my don't live far from you. 🤗 HAPPY NEW YEAR !!! 🥳 🎊 🎉
Anything is possible! I think as long as someone takes first aid/cpr or emt stuff....or a pilot license (which I'm sure you are capable), then you are in the perfect spot. All is and will be well. Blessings of  comfort, safety, health, love, and joy to you in this new year!! "...the beautiful path is patient, always waiting for you to come back, that path that is so familiar to you, and is so faithful. It knows you will come back one day, and it will welcome you back. The path will be as fresh and as beautiful as the first time. Love never says that this is the last time." ~Thich Nhat Hanh
As connected and as I am, I just cannot connect with this idea.  I am not sure why there is even such a decision like this that has to be made at this delicate point in Nicolle‘s pregnancy and your lives. Why are you leaving, where are the positives to this? Help me to understand these thoughts.
wow, this is a bummer ALL THIS WORK & TIME and gonna leave it wow. i understand the situation with the baby, but to leave it behind starting over no way would i do it. HOW DO YOU WALK AWAY FROM THIS WONDERFUL CREATION, ALL THE SWEAT AND TEARS PUT INTO THIS   A TRUE BUMMER. im at a lost for words to have this come to an end, but I wish you guys A HEALTHY AND WONDERFUL BABY BIRTH, AND THAT GOD GUIDES YOUR TRAVELS WITH MANY HEALTHY & WONDERFUL DAYS TO COME.
Se it can’t be done unless you really have to!  By yourself is one thing but a family ? Why don’t you tell everyone that you did this Portugal and how much money you made !?!
😁👍👍🇧🇷
I waiting  your  beby
Im  always looking forward for your blog ,its sad where  you leaving the  off grid forest cabin, good luck  to your first giving birth nicole ,🙏🙏🙏 we miss you both💖 happy new year
Dad is getting fat!
Hello from Minnesota.  You all and your show will be missed. Please come back in the spring
Well we.know they didn't get eaten because the video is up
You are making the correct choice Jake. Focus on your new baby and Nicole. It is the right thing to do for now. You will/Are the caretaker of to lives. From Norm
Привет из России👍🌲🎅
Happy New Year from Slovakia ✋🇸🇰 l love you gays 😍,👍
I hope you  enjoy  your days
Good. I don’t believe Nicole was truly happy there. You took her away from everything to do what you wanted.
Stop being Canadian living in fear and to literally go and say if I lose my garden all this isn't worth it. Spend some time with all the psychos living in fear in Canada and you'll see your way of life is a 1000% better and safer than being with society.
You've come to far too forget your dream.
Hello from Kuwait
I wish you a happy new year 2022, may all your wishes and dreams come true, may God protect you and your family, with best regards Ernst from  Augsburg / Germany
Bonne et heureuse année 2022 a tous depuis la France, le plus dur est derrière nous, le meilleur est à venir.
I will never stop being amazed by that spot in the forest that you're in. Seems magical and quiet, perfect for people who wants to be with natural and leave the chaos in the city.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from me to you and your family hope you had a beautiful Christmas and New Year ...LOVE watching your videos, God Bless...
Finally
Класс 👍🤗👍💕💕💕🖐️ добрый вечер вам ребята 🖐️ здоровья всем 🏡 и малышу 💞💞💞

Commendable to change a lifestyle for your child I bet healthcare isn’t easy on a secluded island
It is sad to see you leave but I am glad you are thinking of the delivery of the new baby.Come back-when you feel it is safe for the family.Good luck and God bless.
I am so DISAPPOINTED WITH BOTH OF YOU! I just found out that you have posted porn videos ! THATS DISGUSTING  YOUR ABOUT TO BE PARENTS  HAVE YOU NO SHAME ???? I FEEL SORRY FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR FAMILIES! I PRAY YOU FIND THE ERRORS IN YOUR WAYS AND TURN TO JESUS  FOR FORGIVENESS!!
Do as you please , think for yourself and be yourself. Don't compromise stand strong. Don't take the Jab's
Merci pour toutes vos magnifiques vidéos ! Meilleurs vœux pour 2022 pour vous et votre famille et un beau BB ! A bientôt. Christophe.
I really enjoy your shows, love your lifestyle. You both work so hard! Good luck with your new family life! Hope to get some update videos in the future! Will miss the videos and your adventures! Good Luck!
Oh Nicole! So good to see you guys.❤ Lovely 😍that you video taped the baby moving. How l missed those precious pregnancy💞 moments! Soon you will be able to sleep💤 a lil better  although the 1st 3 months  the baby will be waking up hungry, for a diaper change and a back rub.✨💫✨It's totally a new n fulfilling adventure💕💋💖
Wow,people leaving some ugly comments! Happy new years guys!
Bebê 😍😍 o bebê 💖😘 querida vai chegar quando?
You guys must of wanted negative comments anyways have the baby keep check on your property and come back once baby is 1 but you Can still record of you going to keep check on property and continue to clean it up so it will be ready once baby starts walking I don’t believe it’s a goodbye yea goodbye 2021 hello 2022 new year new things stop kidding us jake !!!
RETURN QUICKLY. You will find after some time, that this is the real true life right where you are.  A healthy happy birth for you all and I can’t wait to see your baby! You have the life I dream to have with my quintuplets that are overdue.  Your show has inspired me to keep  heading to that goal each day. I bought the land in NC but I’m alone doing it. Kind of scary. Please hurry back.  God bless you both and your new baby too.
Baby and Momma come first ! Keep your heads up and feel them good vibes !
Happy New Year
Porn must be more lucrative.

Advance wishes for New Arrival!
Lugar magnífico. Um feliz e abençoado 2022 para vocês.
💜💜🦋
Three years already! City dweller.
Love u guys’ “opening song” !      I pray for a safe, happy and healthy baby and mother along with an quick labor! (Stay relaxed as possible it helps the process move along quicker but is also easier said than done. Also, don’t take any medications to numb u or induce labor) good luck to u! I believe u will make great parents. Your video here says 10 am premier whereas the set reminder option shows a 1 pm premier time? Which is it?
Love you Nicole and Jake ❤️👨‍👩‍👦❤️
I really so proud of your couple life and so amazing with you work in forest too.
nice shamless pregnant clickbait
Happy New Year Jake and Nicole
Это сила
Умнички семья
Happy new year sir &mam🙏
Without doubt nicola has been glowing throughout her  pregnancy thats a sign of a strong woman who's ready for what's ahead godbless her jake needs to make sure she has everything she'll need over the coming months thats when mother and baby bond beautifully....
Sorry i got your wife pregnant
I love the videos and the positivity they went to an incredibly hard place very isolated hard for anybody honestly looking at their views and everything I always figured that they flew to Maui on the weekends and came back to make videos 👍
Nothing is ever what it seems.
happy new years 2022
Your garden will grow again, Jake. Frost is the enemy we battle. I feel your pain but on a much smaller scale.
jake you really need to grow a pair mate its not like your never coming back... Things ppl do for rating's can be overly overdramatised   tell's the veiwer's you were never a confident person growing up...
Click bait.  Probably just temporarily going closer to medical help.
Yeah Mr Jake has become a MAN his GOING to be a father!!. He had 3 YRS to build a big house with all that Forest wood . BUT at least he has a pizza oven and some Japanese knifes. Greetings from Serbia 🇷🇸
Why so sad you've got millions of people watching you, You've done well in the last few years the money's rolling in You've  done what you set out to do a why should you live in a tent anymore
How big is your chest?
Personal opinion is you have everything you need there. Why start over. Your girlfriend helped allot and when the baby comes allot of her time will be devoted to baby.
Your Millionaires why live in a tent!
You will be back in the Spring with the new baby and resume the BEAUTIFUL LIFE you enjoyed.  I don't believe for a second that its GOOD-BYE AND LEAVING FOREVER.  The dogs will miss this life also.  Happy New Year and Good Luck in this brief pause in your life.
All the work was just a preparation. A new life means stepping up to a better level. God bless your courage and love for life and the angel who will soon fill your days with joy and love.💗💗💗
I'm  glad you are taking the time to enjoy your baby. I felt you were not quite for leaving Nicole. But you will be be very iccupied. You have the makings of an excellent mother. You have so much to share with your baby. You have made a good decision. You couldn't leave your refuge and safe haven for too long. Love, good health and a Happy 2022.
Nicole is still stunning and has that glow about her.
Sounds like Nicolle has put her foot down and said she has had enough of the jungle living.
Feliz año 2022, me encantan sus videos, 👍👍👍
Happy new year. Love your videos. Looking forward to the next every weekTak care. Jan from Denmark.
It says premieres in 5 hours , what if I don't have 5 hours 🤦
Happy New year 2022  Jake&Nicolle 😀
Don’t be sad jake The spirit of Komorebi is with you , may your spirits soar like an eagle!!
I set my YouTube reminder,I hope I don’t miss your guys giving. I am thankful for that, you two are very open and welcoming and to me that is humbling. I’m just glad I have found a way to say that and without antagonistic characteristics. I know I haven’t been the best of a friend, I have never been so scattered or broken up and I can’t apologize for that, I can be better,we all can do better. Wu!! Wu!! Cheers 🥂
당신들에 삶이 아름다워 보임니다 태어날 아기에게 축복을~ 행복하세요~
Ride that wind !
Where is this “bugout” property?  Mexico, Puerto Rico, Chiapas, Texas, Florida, Thailand???
You have a caretaker. You've planned on leaving for months now, stop the dramatic plugs to get us to watch. I like you better when you're less drama.  Having a baby is drama enough.  Of course you'll be back to your Eden.  And then it'll be fun watching you juggle baby and living.  Hope you don't have a rude awakening Jake. Kids are loud, messy, smelly, and all about the ID and EGO, and that's okay.  Remember children 1st before yourself. They will mirror your behavior and reactions to events. So if you don't want drama, don't behave that way. Stay calm and collected.
Notice the question marks? Jake and Nicole rented a nice cabin close to where they are when they were first building their yurt. I am thinking they may just rent that place again as they do improvements to Komorebi
Wow your belly looks like a perfect  moon belly, now the blue child must awaken from his mothers womb to creation and then may he wake his God by the most pure essence that he may have the pure lasting spirit, that ever wakes and is truly lasting. Happy new year’s and hope you are enjoying the baby and new year energy lol 😂 wu!!! Wu!!!
Happy New Year to you both excited to see you
Were the last 3 years just a dream?  Will Komorebi fade from memory like footprints on the sand?
Why you sad? Jake

What??you're leaving??
Leaving Komorebi forever?  Will we be back?  Will the mold, forest, weather, and animals take control of everything we've built!  How will we travel between the properties?
