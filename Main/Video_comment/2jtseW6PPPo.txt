Ramesh shots fired
The world needs reminding of how bad Corden was
Cahley cole
Oh and Jermaine 😮
Both Mo and James have been "cancelled" since 😮😊
jamie spelling bouremouth wrong is so funny
Laura is an absolute rocket
Actually why was Kane taking the corner kicks?!  Didn’t make sense e at all
Clicked on this thinking it would be funny. Then I saw James Corden was the host
everycunt gets knighted these days fs bro yae run nothing else
Rom😂
He ain't vegetarian and he ain't British.
Corden is the worst
Is Mo a drug cheat???
I always thought James Corden was a nice bloke until the Internet told me not to
15 years at Arsenal,..0 league titles...first season at Man United, prem League winner,...stop being salty Arse-holes...hes a United legend
Cordon ruins everything
Logged on to watch it seen Corden immediately off
Who's the fella at 7:28. If he was bold, he'd be the white version of mo Farah.
Im glad cordons gone
Corden,,,stay in america they deserve you
Corden ruins everything     really can not watch him
Lazy eye of the tiger😂
Romesh cooked Persie
ironic how the flying dutchman hates flying
2:00
What a funny bunch
Romesh… that belly 😢
7:55 I just realised that if Arsenal (god forbid), had of beaten us in the Europa League Final and had Tottenham won the Champions League Final then not only would we of had a second all London Final but we would of had a North London Super Cup Final!
Question of sport in the ad break 🤣
But Romesh loved Ashley Cole🤔
Corden makes me feel sick,
WHOS THE GIRL FROM THE FIRST SCENE???
I hope Kevin Bridges doesn’t get back on the show after the jokes he made about the Queen 3 hrs after she passed.
True story, the pool Tony Bellew fell into was actually made from his own spit, due to the scouse accent.
Corden has become unfunny
Romesh’s joke to Ashley Cole didn’t age well
Tony Bellow trying to help Romesh during the fight yelling "He left Arsenal", "Punch him, fight back" had me dying lol.
Tony bellew is a topman proper
"Sir Mo Farah... or whatever his real name is"
I don't even watch this but 11.57 had me in stitches🤣🤣🤣
If I needed to sum up the overly set up, overly drawn out, overly unfunny "mainstream British" sense of humour, this video is perfect.  How do people find this convoluted, over-rehearsed crap funny!
Lazy eye of the tiger 😂😂😂😂
Romesh is too good 🤣🤣
Probably go question of sport in the ad break lol😂😂😂
Absolutely gut wrenching clips!  So funny!!  😆
Never understood why fans think that a player from another country that never supported your team and has already left another team to come to yours is somehow being disloyal in leaving. Surely their disloyalty in leaving their previous team and coming to yours never seemed to bother you but now all of a sudden when they want to leave they are snakes. Every year arsenal lets go of players who signed as kids and spent 10 years in some cases playing for the club only be told their services are no longer required where is their loyalty? Why is a player wanting to leave a club disloyal but when a club no longer wants a player it’s just part of the game? He isn’t an arsenal fan so the thought of being loyal is just stupid
😭😭😭😭Romesh did what all Arsenal fans wanted to do
Tony Bellew is hillarious
That should have been the end of James' career.
These are the 'best bits'? Lol
Man like Cashley
Thank god James Corden has gone to America
Arsenal fans are so pathetic
Romesh is actually hilarious lol
Its amazing how diverse and woke football and Britain has become. A multi cultural tin of emotions and feelings...
"i just want my laren back dashain" haha
What exactly is Romesh good at?  It's certainly NOT comedy!!
Romesh and Pilkington both find their comedy gold moments in the great moan of life.
“He left Arsenal!” 😅😂😂🤣🤣😂
I miss Corden and jack
Romesh Sri Lankanathan
3:30 thats the most threatening thing ever
How does Ashley Cole keep focused, I'd say looking in his trophy cabinet and seeing a champions league winners medal helps
click bait! 09:50 & 11:24
11:45 Classic James Corden
What a great show this could be. Just remove corden.
We rinsed Romesh when it happened I was there and saw his pain.
At least we get a chance next year lol will never win it 😂
Ashley Cole is gorgeous
Wanted to see a clip, realised corden hosts this show, left. 👍
Romesh dead serious.I'm sure a lot of us would say the same to certain footballers. *As footballers only, not as people. UTV
I've given this show a few goes now. Truly awful show. Nothing compared to how good They think it's all over was
rvp could been one the all time great strikers, but he was injured most of his career
Surprised there wasn’t any ofcom complaints over “Rom the bomb”
*"He left Arsenal!" - Tony Bellew*
Romesh didn't have a lot of fight in him in that last spot, although still a lot more than arsenal had in the last 10 years.
Tony falling into the pool is one of the funniest bits of telly I’ve ever seen 😂
Romesh is savage
His another one of those as soon as his on the box , you flick the switch to another channel  .
Love how Romesh definitely knew beforehand Mo wasn't really vegetarian 😂
Gang of Arsenal’s lol
When James Corden didn’t get a response about Harry Kane taking corners😂😂😂😂💀💀
11:42 is how I feel about everything James Corden spouts
The banter love it
“Gang of arseholes”😭😭😭
I was in you back garden mate looking at you family banter banter😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how Romesh doesn't care about calling someone a prick to their face 😂
The breakable burn wailly intend because friend causally suggest lest a big cheetah. rapid, material denim
"I was in your back garden watching your family ha ha ha banter"😂😂😂
In the 2012/13 season   Man Utd won the league with 89pts  A goal difference of 43   Arsenal finished 4th at 73 pts  With a goal difference of 35   Van persie  scored 26 goals for Utd  Two hat tricks and the golden boot    I think had he stayed at arsenal They MIGHT have won the league   But I am pretty sure Manchester Utd  Would have most definitely NOT won the league without him    So it begs the question why did van persie leave   And it’s clear as day  He had enough of arsenal
I love Sam Quek
Arsenal fans are deluded. If all your players led you and became more successful you’re the problem.
11:46
Romesh = brown and really very very English
Really enjoyed this clip. I don't usually watch the show but this had me laughing on several occasions
This video was click bait. But it absolutely worked 😂
Arsenal stood by him through rape allegations and injuries , had one good season and leaves for a rival that's why arsenal fans hate the glory grabbing prick .
what is james corden doing hosting this  ? i thought he was in the u.s. ?
The guys is so natural with his bants.
And they want you to pay for this crap,mind boggles.
3:34
The good days when people liked james Corden
Harry Kane on corners 😂😂
10:00 your welcome
🐷 James Corden
Romesh doing us Sri Lankan’s proud 😂💪🏾❤️
Actual part of thumbnail description is at 9.50 and only last 20 secs, rest of vid is unrelated
Tony: HE LEFT ARSENAL!!!” Hahahahaha
I’m an Arsenal fan and I don’t hate RVP because I don’t think he’s a bad lad.
Watching this, makes me miss Sky.  I hope Corden is not a prick in real life.  The rumours are he doesn't interact with the audience. 🤔
I thought quorn had milk in it. Not vegan
Misleading title 🙄
Of course it’s the last thing on the video
Alright James calm down
You want prosecuting with the trade description act.
Uk pc comedy is dead now
These people rnt even the funniest in there own groups of friends !!!!! Uk is being sold short an morning can be done it’s too late now
Pc humour has killed tv
Pc humour has killed uk tv
Pc humour has ruine this country
We need all the a league of their own clips!
I clicked on this video to watch van Persie and romesh not for James-Bullshit Corden
clickbaitttttttttttttttttttttt
Ashley Cole is such a knob
Romesh is so unfunny.
Domes scaring unfunny   I just don't get him... I think he is what's called a token..bit like Diane Abbot
Why is corden such a...
Where was fight. Wasn't even.. click bait gets a channel block. Good job
13.38 of pure laughter.   Thanks for the upload
What a load of bellends
James Corden is poo
Criminally un-funny diversity hire
Because a multi million pound company need 15 ad breaks in a 13 minute video right enough
Were do I get the blow up ring from nd gloves
Harry Winks shows off about Spurs' 2019/2020 champions League campaign only to lose 7-2 at home to Bayern
What do Asians know about football anyhow?
This show is pure quality!
I was in your back garden
Imagine wanting to be at an ambitious club instead of a club that doesn’t appreciate you and would be worse off without you. No Romesh, you’re the prick mate 🤣
https://youtu.be/Rz_-Pzo8Iiw 🔥
This show has effectively killed A question of sport. Itd do boring compared to this lot.
I would have told him, "you're not  even the best Dutch striker either teams ever had"
Romesh is so funny man, didn't even realise he was that funny
Ramesh it Must be huge to meet one of Manchester United’s greatest ever strikers?  Your a prick mate 😂😂😂😂😂
10:45 I love it how when a disabled person jokes about their disability everyone laughs, the audience clap and it’s all nice and friendly. When an able bodied person jokes about someone’s disability it’s frowned upon to the point of them being cancelled. What a messed up world we’re all a part off (obviously some of us have more parts than others)
Rob and Romesh mate. Bromance.
Cole left for the money Van Persie left for a bigger club.
Ashley Cole is a good sport going back on after Jack Whitehall ripped into him on there.
Romesh the try hard lol
Asher Smith is fit 😍
How can I go from hating James corden on the late late show to loving him on here
Gang of arseholes😂😂😂
Didn't even notice the switch up to Claire balding at first
I feel like this is a much more genuine James cordon. What is that gremlin on American tv
Hope bellew makes it home safely to his wife and kids
9:50 for Romesh and Van Persie
Clicking this was the worse mistake of my 2020. Now I'm getting ads and recommendations of his videos. YouTube never liked my explicitly playlists
Ramming a Nathan
Content is absolute gold
Wtf is wrong with Romesh's stomach?
Great banter asking a Muslim if he eats pork 🙄
Romesh is a toxic person. His standup is  lame. He just sprouts racial abuse against white brits and Northerners. Lazy comedy.  He's a narcissist who cannot comprehend people think differently to him.... And they are actually right.  RVP owned him nothing!
Tony bellew is a lowkey hero 😂
It isn’t the same without jack Whitehall
I’d turn into mike Tyson the minute I get in that ring
Dt should’ve been on this
When Tony Bellew is like what are you doing fight back and Romesh punches the air and falls over 😂😂😂😂😂
LAUGHED THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH🤣🤣
Can you upload the stand by me moment please!
Wasn’t really a fight, lasted like 2 seconds
he left arsenal then beat him up 🤣🤣
Bellew being forced to do tv work again. Why can’t you media lot leave him alone & understand he just wants to be at home with his wife and kids?   Shellfish bastards, the lot of yous.
The most underrated comment is 0:10-0:15
This is better than James Cordens late night show
He left and won a championship in his first year it was the best decision he ever made
The laughter in the background...
ITS NOT MISUNDERSTANDING YOU'RE ADVERTISING QUORN YOU PRICK!!!😂😂
What did this shite win a bafter for?
"Yeah I think he's a prick"😂😂
RVP WHAT A LEGEND
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4) 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13)
Rvp looked like he genuinely didnt understand the Question of Sport crack 😂😂😂
This was hilarious 🤣
Clickbait title, that said, that romesh clown is not funny, how is he on TV?
“Finally, fuckin hell” - Brilliant 😂
I love romesh
Let me save you from the rest of the shite. Title of vid is for 5 seconds 9:50
So funny Romesh
This is the first time ive seen this programme, it looks ace. When i saw it in the tv guide i just thought it was that film on all the time. Haahahahah
So where was the part rvp fights  Romesh?
Time to get Aubameyang on the show for Romesh
He left arsenal to win titles with man united
Romesh is the main man
Irrefutable! Fraud, hoax virus, treason: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsmFTCbnMGY&feature=youtu.be https://cvpandemicinvestigation.com/
This show is jokes
Romesh is jokes 😂
probably go to question of sport in the adbreak pahahahahahaha yes!
Pff; these guys are just having a laugh, there's no real hatred. I think RVPrick is no where near fit to lace the boots of Mat Le Tissier anyway, who rejected calls from Slur Fuggyson to remain at Soton for the whole of his career.  That's class RVPrick, you Priceless Prick
9:50 I don't think van persie knew what he going on about!
Why am I just seeing this show 😂
Americans watching this would be so confused
Who’s the blonde
You now realise free will is a myth
Crazy click bait
What season/episode was the Tony in goal switch ? 6:10
How is Mo Farah Britain's best ever athlete?
Best show on TV no doubt
11:45 got me bad.
Your advertising corn you prick 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do yourselves a favour and forget it. If you don't believe me the non fight is at 13:01..
"My worst fear is my fave striker leaving for a rival " 😂😂too funny
Asher Smith damn🖤🖤
The lack of Jack Whitehall makes me fucking ecstatic.
Didn’t Freddie and Tony have a bit of a tiff on one of the eps
That was the best setup to say I never saw u on the pitch ashley
3:17 bottom right good to see Mike dean out in the crowd
Good content.
Romesh is a prick
When Jack and Corden left a league of their own died for me
Robin Van Persie is actually my fav cuz he left arsenal and won a title
Ashley Cole wearing a 250k watch
It’s quite funny how these z list stars all of a sudden are football supporters- respect ✊ to mo the rest are duckheads
I wouldn't be surprised if the vegan community came after mo
Romesh is the biggest DOSSER on TV.
Roy Keane still carrying sky regardless
Romesh is the ultimate token brown on UK panels
I hate James Corden
It may just be me but i don't think Sam Quek is funny
15 seconds that's it's
🐍🐍🐍🐍
Not really a fight though is it lol
Arsenal banter fc lol
Mo is an Athlete of course he is not a vegetarian
As an arsenal fan I will always ❤ RVP
Having a season ticket and not using it is why everyone jokes about Emirates being silent give the tickets away romesh (after covid)
Wouldn’t mind escaping up her tunnel
Probably go to question of sport in the ad break! 😂😂😂
'No I think he's a prick' top lad
'The little boi inside him screamed Manchester United' so Arsenal fans can forgive him.
You came here for 9:50
9:52
You didn't shut Arsenal fans up by playing well. They already knew you were on the way to being the best left back. They're angry the way you snaked a transfer. The modern day equivalent would be if Bakayo Saka went to Chelsea or Phil Foden going to Man UTD
He's a prick 😂😂 legend
James is getting more obesese
Yes Romesh. Do your thing
james is a wankstian
James Corden is is a wanktain on humanity
HEATED
this is the type of content i need and btw who else is hyped for the new season of champions on br/football
probably go to question of sport in the adbreak pahahahahahaha
I’m all for this type of content.
First
