odio esta canción, es tan bella, nostálgica y deprimente :'c  siempre la escuchaba con mi ex cuando íbamos a la playa de noche o cuando nos amanecíamos en la cama... por qué tuvo que terminar tan feo todo dios
Still here in 2025 swooning over this 🤩 this became one of my favorite songs ever.
Obsessed with this song...
I love oasis but Alex turner might have more talent than em all put together.....
smoother than silk
Prince would have absolutely loved this!
Can anyone tell me what this song is about?
That opening tho. That 40 seconds was beautiful..
I still don't understand why people don't like this. Just feel something would ya.
My fav song to play at home.
Stunning... Absolutely perfect performance of this beautiful song 🪐
I will always love Arctic Monkeys 🥹🖤
Ten utwór, krótko hmm .....jest doskonały w każdym calu , idealny pomysł aranżacja wykonanie no i oczywiście Alex jedyny w swoim rodzaju pa Jerzyk
Alex Turner was doing this style years ago with The Last Shadow Puppets
in lovinnnnng again
1:10 - how many shakers could you shake simultaneously? - yes
QUE HERMOSOOOOO
Why does Alex actively try to make each album slower than the last one I don’t understand
I am gobsmacked by his voice
REAL MUSIC! ❤
I cry every time I hear this song. 😢
absolute cinema
Is it just me or does Alex Turner look younger 😆😆😆😆
Is that that guy that tries to live forever?
❤
I'm glad they've grown and not tried to stick to what made them popular but hypocritically, Id like some old arctics back. Impossible to do but beneath the boardwalk and whatever people say I am was my teenage years.
Alex Turner compró ese buzo en Mauro Sergio
The bass being mixed so prominently in The Car and TBHC era AM live shows is the best thing ever. Nick o’Malley is incredible
This is a masterpiece. Tremendous
Fuck, this is good. The 2 most recent albums are among the best albums ever made.
hay algo en el plano del 3:50 que me destruye. Cómo lo mira con tanta atención y se nota con su lenguaje corporal lo inmerso que está en la música. Hay algo muy humano y potente en la situación que está sucediendo.
I don't know how people do not appreciate what this band has been doing. Absolutely amazing creativity, sophistication, beautiful lyrics, top instrumentation and going against the trends.
Bé mèo đứng giữa chất ghê
The first sync between musics...brutal.
Stunning composition. Wonderful work by the boys all around.
How sofisticated and melancholic is this. My broken soul is grateful for such an bluey elegant melody
I miss the old AM, This Suck!
It's all about the clothes
Sounds like it should be being played in the milk bar from a clockwork orange.
That drum kick at the intro, beautiful
I am convinced that Alex is the sexiest man alive on this earth. He’s just so hot 🥵
so cool
stunning camera work
Nice song! Keep making this kind of music
02:58 that look....... damn.
love that "look them eyes" camera moment at 2:52, only looking at the camera when he's saying "baby its been nice"
Wow, this is so bad that everyone has to embrace their musical journey bit.
Самая удачная композиция,и двигается клево😮🎉🎉🎉

Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball? You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment when you look them in the eyes And say, "Baby, it's been nice" So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? La, oh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
This is the real music ❤
Weird question but what colour is Alex’s jumper here ?
How are they soooo good live 😭
how the FUCK does one sound this good live
❤
I'd like to see the full set !
Beautiful!
So the good music is still alive...
This white man can SING!!
Can you imagine...... The Artic Monkeys Playing "Brainstorm" then "Mirrorball" at a concert?     Very few bands have that Dynamic ❤.
Whoever set the camera angles needs to be knighted.
O foda é que ele sabe.
How do I put this politely.. ehem.. this is somewhat.. dull.. it sounds, stale, uninspired, and unlived. And just overall mid. Really, how long can you milk making unreleased James Bond soundtracks? I think his nipples are bleeding vinegar by now. .Enough with the arctic, where are the monkeys?
I'm pregnant
"don't get emotional..that ain't like you"❤‍🩹
Arctic Monkeys are the greatest band to ever exist. Cant tell me otherwise.
This could have been written and sung by David Bowie, Now that's a compliment!
alex está tão lindo que dá vontade de chorar
I didn’t like the 2018 album at first. I listened to The Car and that album has grown on me.😊
yuck bro wtf is this?
Leyenda está banda
Nothing beats this!!!!!
Coisa linda ❤
one of the most underrated songs
so do you wanna walk me to the caaaaaaaaaaaaauuurrr?
my future husband better look identical to alex turner
Espetacular!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
WOW!!! WOW WOW WOW!!!!!! I just recently discovered these guys and of all the songs I've listened to so far this is by far my favorite!!  So fkn AMAZING!!   🔥🔥🔥
I feel sorry for the people who hate the new am
he will be known as a poet more than a rock star when there is distance between his songs and time
This song is crazy good

solo comento para q cada vez que alguien le de me gusta a mi comentario regresar aquí y disfrutar de esta obra maestra
From listening  to the monkey's  from when they first started  till now you don't realise how much you've grown  up
Mossie Loaf
I just never going to be able to get into this crooning stuff.  I miss the riffs and clever lyrics
ATE. NO CRUMBS
While I'm getting older they follow the life course 😅
Lets all start saying  "yesterday's still leaking through the roof." And all the other great phrases he has written. Sometimes i say "we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and tie combination" to allude to breakdown in classist social structure
Alex still looks fantastic clean-shaven.
The Car truly is a phenomenal record, isn't it?
You deserve a hug right now
Long way from a steamy punkband. Congrats am

this song will forever suit the mood
I don’t know how many times I’ve seen this performance. I love it. Never is enough ❤🖤🔥
Brilliant!!!
Performing at kino
Seit definitiv richtig schön gay zusammen gewachsen
ALEX IS AMAZING ON GUITAR BUT AS SOMEONE WHO PLAYS PIANO THIS MADE ME SMILE TO SEE HIM PLAY THE PIANO
Augeeeee da beleza desse home
❤❤❤❤
if this song doesn't play at my funeral, i will not be attending
This is such a beautiful sounding sound, but I don't understand it for the life of me
Он великолепен❤❤❤
I love this song
Ay noooo amo a alex turner ❤
3:35
I’m lost for words
Remarkable voice
Czuję się jakbym słuchała ścieżki dźwiękowej z filmu Dawida Lyncha . Cudowna ,hipnotyzująca muzyka . Uwielbiam
es lo mas verg% que he visto en los ultimos años, me super mam%.  me lleva al pasado...
Essa música transcende
Der Basslauf ab 2:35 ist einfach supercool.
this autoplayed on my laptop and i had no idea it was a live performance until halfway through, alex turner's voice is one of the best
This song knocks at the heartstrings with every listen
So heartbreaking.... This is all I can listen to while I go a difficult relationship time that's all because of me
Sounds pretty groovy at 1.25 speed
His voice in this reminds me of Neil diamond
Imagine the shift when you realize you can sing, and you don't need to make crotch rock anymore...
Wow, what a great songs, memories of a old lover how things could’ve been so different so many different time this is from Detroit Michigan
First album fighting against pretentious bands singing in an American accent: 2021 Arctic’s -*hold my merlot*
Me defraudó este directo grrrr 😬
I get goosebumps when I listen to arctic monkeys love this song. Some songs are a breath of fresh air when you hear all the non royalty usual that is played most of the time.
Essa musica passa uma vibe do caralho!!! Obrigado, aprofundo!
та ну не, дохера элитарно, я такое не выкупаю
This is my favorite song of all time is so nostalgic yet it makes me happy and sad at the same time
Yet to hear a better version….
This is a mean nasty protest album............against mediocrity.
The Micheal Jackson’s stand
Me encanta su sueter chompa y el.bello ambiente ...la.musica y la voz de Alex ...la.madurwz del.grupo ❤
That's the Dogs bollocks
I think they're into a time travel. They are coming from the 50's, and The Car is at 70's. Soon they'll be at 2000's and so on.
te amo artic monfys y alex me hacen tan feliz

Unbelievable!!!!!
Makes my heart skip a beat ❤️
The more I listen to it,  the more I like. Alex performs is such perfect that it gives me goosebumps.
Old money
This is a beautiful wild card. Don’t break up
bro this song has me crying 😭😭
I hope wherever she is, she's happy
🥹❤️
Bom pra poha

Excelente canción
I think i am now at least 20k of these views
"I just wanted to be one of The Strokes" specifically Julian. Haha. It's a complement both ways. Both my fav bands!!!
Omg, his vocals came so much better, it’s amazing
This possibly might be their best song ever, certainly my favourite song they ever have done. Brilliant, keep coming back to it which is just the sign of a great song. Wont hear otherwise
damn, the heartbreak in this performance is outright pouring af, the man put some weight to the lyrics through the emotional vocal delivery. i barely can survive the studio version, but this shit might be  borderline traumatizing lool  jokes aside, such a quality tune it is, no matter the perspective you look at it from, love it  though i hoped that they’ll bring the strings to the stage, but literally everything else is executed perfectly, so really, this is me bitching rather than anything else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Esse som é simplesmente um absurdo!
This song is exceptional
4:02 ALEX TURNER THE MAN THAT YOU ARE
This song reset me
Best song they've ever done. Sensational.
It doesn’t get any better than this!!!!
he's so majestic on this video, that video makes me feel, unreal
i absolutely love the arctic monkeys. its a phase that you can’t grow out of!
Alex turner has just grown performance voice ge brings you in too his music❤❤❤❤
the sounds are on point 👌
i watch this everyday fr
se ele é um homem, então ele é o homem da minha vida
such a nice feeling, realizing that guys are going through life just like I do, not trying to stick to something that is no longer making them happy or meaningful and instead trying things they feel are worth doing
É loucura pensar em arctic monkeys top 10 bandas inglesas da história?
one year later, still sounds magical
throw the rose tint back on the exploded view
Alex is such a phenomenal live entertainer.  10/10 front man. Creates literal magic on that stage. Have to see these guys live in good seats before i die.
this is the most beautiful song in the world
No bc this song makes me cry lol. It’s perfect
Incredible Interpretation.............................Alex and whole......................................Band..............................Keyboards..............drums...................Bass....................Super percusion........................
Besides the fact that this is the masterpiece, I'd like to say that I wish I was his microphone😂
I don’t think there is a single person on earth who wouldn’t like at least one arctic monkeys album, they have something for everyone.
Sexual tension much 😅
The whole aesthetic of Arctic Monkeys is so fantastic and beautiful!
Anyone know of any song that somewhat is similar to this song
The Drummer 💔

You are David Bowie's children ! Love !
Everytime I hear this I want to cry. Lovely.
Doesn’t get better than this!!!!!
alex turner, I'd like to marry you
I feel in this album the instrumental side and the rythme are sooo perfect more than the vocals  I'm arctic fan btw
If I were to think about Alex Turner's self actualization- it would be this song.
I'm completely mesmerized by this song
Perfeição ❤
His voice……wow❤
Alex made the perfect performance. His voice notes about this song, his body language is so melancolic and you can feel it seeing him through his face expressions and timing in each words. Love him, greetings from Mexico. Sorry for my English if its not good enough 😅.
One of my favorite songs by them.
I can only think of one word!!!! SUBLIME 🙂
Look at the  lovely colour coordinated jumpers of Alex and Nick, isn't that sweet,  perhaps a 2 for the price of 1 job....  Great song...
I can't get over with this
The mix is always the best you can find on Jools. I dont know if it's venue choice or just high quality production but everyone sounds better on Jools
I hate Artic Monkeys but this song and this performance is stella.
Saw them in Sacramento this year, best singer I’ve heard live
I already told my daughter, this better be played at my funeral ❤
oh my god this is the first time i’ve heard the shaky instrument things, i think their called moraccas?? but my eyes opened even more holy shit
I do kinda hate the notion that musicians should mature and in order to do so they must make slow wallpaper music. this song is really good, but of the rest of the album is very dull and not nearly as interesting as TBHC. no the last two albums  not the same, they are worlds apart. all these comments are talking about the maturity as if you have to throw in the towel in your forties. like some of these new songs make ultracheese feel exciting.
I love that they change their artistic creativity with each album. Sign of a musical genius. Alex’s proud dad watching at 3.51.
Tremendo tema weon
Minha música favorita do álbum ❤❤(o Alex está sempre elegante e charmoso)
The lyrics and sentiment have remained the same and the music has evolved into something truly magical..
Esta canción solo la pude apreciar después del concierto del 7/10/23, es perfecta
Forever loving their music it’s always so fresh from the beats to the lyrics it’s so beautiful
That sweet voice, good damn ❤
악틱몽키즈 내한 해라 제발🙏
Masterful performance, Glastonbury was sublime !
Real music is real!
I don't know why but my current fixation is Alex 😔
The fact that this album released on the same day as Taylor Swift's Midnights and went into relative obscurity is why i don't care for popular opinions on any topic.
i love their latest album, its different but thats ok. ive found myself singing the songs from the car all the time, theyre so addicting
This is magic. Love em
Huge fan of Arctic Monkeys. Saw them at Splendour with Block Party. Absolutely loved their gigs!
exquisita !
Porqué no darle el Grammy a éstos señores?? Que disco que producción, que regreso, que talento!!!
Alex, Matt, Jamie, Nick. Dont listen to Anthony Fantano. Ever
Now I can die in peace 😍🔥
Why are they doing this shit?
Hauntingly beautiful <3
Shit
the comments are so yikes...
turgid. what happened?
Lounge Club Frozen Monkeys
Magnifique❤
These are their best two eras and I hope they continue doing this.
suculento camarógrafo
The BBC is the most corrupt organisation working with our Government feeding people with propaganda bull$hit!!!!!...Such a shame this has been tainted with their poison !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tão refinado ❤️‍🔥
This is how you do it, absolutely sensational!!!
PRINCE ALEX FROM SHEFIELD
Utter Perfection.............AM Forever
my god...
the prettiest song ever
Siri how can I be authentic like the arctic monkeys?
Without words. Masterpiece. Absolute masterpiece. ❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏👏
Absolutely a beautiful piece. Absolutely. Beautiful.... Great..... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
For me a great great song.... Super played and super interpreted..... Really good.... 👏👏👏👏👏
"Like wine gets better with time"
Alex turner predicted barbienheimer when he said "throw rose tint at the exploded view"
So sexy so so sexy
Is he listening to Bryan Ferry these days?😊
Dude is ice cold
this feels like the most pretentious thing ever, the way alex is acting, the  music does not help sell the bravado imo.
Astonishing.
North England!!
Great classic song!
Just beautiful.. no more word’s required 🥰🎵🎵

Gone fukin shite
Sound amazing live
sounds so good
This is so deep
Best album in a long time
pra mim essa é a conversa antes deles entrarem No carro
I've grown with them. I'm 36 now and I think completely in tune with the AM vibe
Un maestrazo este cabron, es genial
Uh-oh looks like the Monkeys have upset a few people with this album. Y'all need to write to them immediately and tell them all about how you feel. Then they will realize what they've done to you and record and release a Whatever People Say I Am part 2. And an apology.
Is there a way I can inject this song straight into my veins?
I will always love their music, others don’t like that they don’t get a FWN 2.0 or AM 2.0 but that’s how great these guys are, they will always try new sounds and I love and respect that so much
This album will always encapsulate running around London in the middle of winter with the girl of my dreams. It transports me back there instantly.
This is Alex's one of the best and the most underrated live performance ever. Period. Like for real this is FKN MAGIC to my ears and soul. What a Masterpiece!
I'm thoroughly convinced that Arctic Monkeys have turned out to be The Beatles of the 21st century.
This song is a masterpiece of melancholy. Alex’s voice is angelic.😇🪩
I was here
God this is sad.
Masterpiece.
This is incredible
Too mopey… a Lounge Act at best.  Too bad.
i’ve heard this like 8 times in a row. best live performance ever.
Incredible❤
I don’t like the band tbh.. but if they continue to go to this direction, they’re gonne be my fave (one of).. but if 🤔
does alex wanna be frank sinatra
What I like about the band is that they seem impervious to what record executives think is best. Keep going, just evolve at your own pace
WHERE HAVE I BEEN???? THIS SONG IS MY FAVORITE FROM THE CAR, I LOVE YALLLLLLLLLLL
The video might be broken, it doesn't have any sounds
Especialmente a Alex, tremendo artista ❤️
Tremenda cancion, lo mejor que he escuchado hoy, primera vez que me tome el tiempo de conocerlos y lod amee
When I grow up i wanna be Alex Turner
Che classe...🎩
My tickets were resold on Ticketmaster. Was looking forward to seeing them for the first time since 2007 but honestly can't stand their "new sound" and I fear that would be the majority of their setlist at this point. Urghh
Alex has grown enormously since his early singing days, looking forward to seeing him in a few days
3:03 MUSICAÇA! AM ficou ainda melhor nessa pegada dos 2 últimos albúns.
they ALWAYS sound better in live... which makes me sad that they never come to Korea😢
Awesome
Ptm que rola.
alex,why are you so pretty
viejo hermoso
This new album it’s perfect I can’t understand why people think it’s boring it’s just perfect 😫
Song literally makes me want to cry
They love you alex
te amo…..
The Arctic Monkeys are no longer in the "fast & furious" stage mates. Welcome to their David Bowie era.
Alex has  a different aura
I love this song sooo much. So glad that for the first time i can watch them live on february!!! It was the best memories of my life!
Best album they’ve ever done. It’s already one of my favorite albums of all time
Procutores y marketing: El reggaeton y el hip hop son lo mas popular en el mundo, Monkeys deberian hacer algo de eso.  Alex: Vayanse a la mierda todos ustedes, estan despedidos.
Alex having that ross geller drip lmao
I'm completely captivated by this performance. It's hard to explain, but it just makes time stop for me.
👏 Bravo
Tsja, I hope you've got your story straight! Geweldig!
Last 2 albums are pure garbage
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
JAMEH MESSED UP AT 0:16 XD
3:35 - what a moment
Monkeys never disappoints
God damn, Alex gets me everytime
I want this song on my wedding
❤
🗿🍷
this album on airpods is awful, on vinyl or big speakers, one of their best
That synth in 3:20 is nasty
No group has consistently made amazing music since those 4 from the 60's
That was AMAZING ❤ absolutely amazing

Magnifico!
He looks so good
Master piece, anything else to say? I guess no
This signer is something else.
I can't wait to see where they will go next, I will appreciate any direction they will take.  I'm not hesitant at all to grow old with this band.
It's the living reincarnation of Scott Walker, without the self depreciation!
EVERYONE LEFT THE FESTIVAL WHEN THEY STARTED PLAYING THIS SONG
Alex is on form here! It's like he was testing out live performances before this to nail it on Jools!
Love watching this when I’m having a bad day it’s so comforting
Wow.
These 1.5 mill r just me watching it again aha and they r incredible. Much feeling into the music. Watch it at 0.75 if u dare ahaha
This album hits me like the Humbug album. This one is a masterpiece!
Wowwwwwww ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Broooo Arctic monkeys make me feel some way that I can’t explain omg
titikim
Arctic monkeys going to radiohead
he's so good in that sweater!
His voice has aged so well, I've followed this band for about twenty years now and I ceased to be amazed at the absolute art this band produces, they always produce the most breathtaking poetic music without doubt💛
15 years listening to them... a lot changed, we changed, their music changed... it feels like life you know? different stages and each album makes me reflect on what is happening to me too, it's lovely.
masterpiece, i don't think there is any other word to describe this song
Português: "Mesmo nas horas mais difíceis, mantenha a esperança viva em seu coração e acredite que dias melhores virão." Coreano: "어려운 시간이 와도 항상 희망을 가슴에 품고 더 나은 날이 올 거라 믿어주세요." (Eoryeoun sigani wado hangsang huimangeul gaseume pumgo deo naeun nari ol geo-ra mideojuseyo.)
Damn, young Furio Giunta can sing
pls no synthie music in the future. we need more stuff like this. i wish i could give some lyrics and ideas in a own band but no one interested in a nobody and screems in the air shall away to the great spiral generator for no return
Goose bumps every time I listen to this, magical
Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball? You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment when you look them in the eyes And say, "Baby, it's been nice" So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? La, ohh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
What a voice
Saw this live  on Monday and it was so beautiful and emotional I didnt take a vid of it I was just absorbing all of it while the light got the mirrorball creating the most beautiful stage lighting 😭❤️‍🔥🎸 #arcticmonkeysManila2023
Awesome tune!
Increible, en verdad jaja
Carajo esto si es música
A band at the peak of their powers. Brilliant
They all aged like fine wine especially nick !
Hated this song but after seeing them live, i went home listening to this every single day.
Never really got in to this band but this is class, Scott walker feel about it...
Beautiful song 🖤🖤🖤
genius////
he looks ok here not like on the recent videos from the tour where he's looking like he's pushing 50 dafq happened...
what an incredible introduction
Alex what a beautiful voice and singing. He could sing a capella and it will also be perfect. These guys! so much talent!
１００回くらい聞いた！
im in love with alex
the talent is unmatched. Truly one of my favorite bands of all time
2:39 through to final note is the greatest piece of music and vocal delivery I’ve heard in a long time. A work of art.
Authenticity
TE AMO ALEX
Alex’s best performance ever.
i love how this album is and the vibe of it, also this album is probably one of the best in a lyrical way. literally so good just like the other albums. if you don’t like it just get over it and let people enjoy it, just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean other people can’t love it.
even Alex admitted he got emotional, why shouldn't I? 🥲
te amo alex turner
Did anyone else notice that he didn't close his eyes for the whole song, while he has done that before? Feeds to the theory that "The Car" is just a mask.
the way i disregard the first lyric every time this performance comes on

I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me?  La, ohh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
Utter fire 🔥
perfect song
I wonder how tricky for jamie and nick to sync with matt during the intro before alex kicks in. And they have to do it every live shows
The lyrics make me think this is actually about their current approach and the backlash from some of the public
It sounds exactly like record because it's written with real instruments. Love this album a lot, 100% my jam😍
Hauntingly beautiful
they take themselves too seriously these days
Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood  So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball?  You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment when you look them in the eyes And say, "Baby, it's been nice"  So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? La, ohh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
reminds me of 'This guys in love with you' by Burt Bacarach. Beautiful
beautiful set design wow
Excellent
Melhor música do álbum.
FRANK SINATRA
アレックスめっちゃシブくなってきたなぁ！！めっちゃアダルティでかっこいいなぁ！！
What a fucking tune
Still overrated, that ego is really impressive tho... lmao
"Somehow giving it the old romantic fool seems to better suit the mood" 🙌🏼
Una exquisitez  de música.
The car is the best music for sleeping issues!
I LOVE ITTTTT
That synth-melody brings me to tears - absolutely beautiful!
so if you wanna walk meee to the car
What a drum sound!
🖤
Brilliant stuff lads !!🙌🙌😂
Beautiful
Masterpiece <3
That groove is absolutely amazing
Que mal 🤧
...как они выросли в музыкальном плане !...всегда думал что они клоны the Strokes😄 как я ошибался ...это даже не рок ...это абсолютно новый уровень !🖤🤘
Sleeping!!!!pffffff...!!! I prefer the masters Roxy Music...now Artic is just a back band for Alex...this song is not bad but i listen this kind of song millions times....!!!Not vey interesting.....!!!! they came to paris last year and the concert was...without soul!!!! Ennuyeux in french!!!
The Best of 2022
Deym, Alex Turner is one of the unique voices we got
❤❤❤
You would never tire of listening to this one
it's funny how I became a fan during their traquility base era so I don't get all those people mourning their old stuff
Fucking GOAT 🐐
MASTERPIECE!
Much respect!
Arctic Monkeys siempre ha sido de esas bandas que escuchaba de vez en cuando y que estaba lejos de ser una de mis favoritas, pero este álbum me terminó de atrapar por completo, se que a muchos no les gustó y en parte por esa curiosidad es que lo escuché, jamás había escuchado un disco de AM completo y solo puedo decir que lo amo, es precioso y de lo mejor que he escuchado en el último tiempo
My god, what a load of drivel
Loving Alex’s hair. He’s looking and sounding good
Nothing change about them, they're still the arctic monkeys ik🥳
Not sure people yet fully realise how utterly brilliant this song is. It might well be their best tune, and I doubt they’ll be able to top it anytime soon.
I love you guys 💕 Alex you're making history ✨
Missing the earlier grit. This feels like pretending. Just me, perhaps.
I got tickets to see them later in the year and from now I can tell that at least half of the concert is going to suck. Just imagine listening to this in a stadium half a mile away from the stage 😴
this song deserves the grammy nomination
Happy birthday Alex,Natalie from Leeds xx
That eye contact starting at 2:59 got me on a chokehold
Hello beautiful people, I share a cover of "There'd Better Be A Mirrorball" song on drums I hope you like it 🥁❤‍🔥 https://youtu.be/mnriJUQl_vE
absolutely beautiful and amazing.
The greatest band of their generation
Alex, his voice, and these Monkeys simply kill me, my goodness 🥰🙉🤘❤️
UNREAL!!
What a fantastic song on the album and the live version is even better. The Monkeys do what they want. We should worship and adore them for following their on musical path. Cheers from Germany
Perfection
Im loving this ... Its a bit of me ....what album is this i wanna hear some more of this ...its pukka
Eu amo tanto esse álbum ✨✨✨ 😻
Perfeita 😍✨😍
People praising these for this awfulness honestly. Oh their artistic instincts, seriously this is terrible. 0 artistic instincts if you think this is good.
Arctic Monkeys amadureceu de um jeito meio equivocado... The Car é muito depressivo e chega a ser repetitivo, tem no máximo umas 4 musicas memoráveis, o que não quer dizer que o álbum é uma porcaria, é bom, mas poderia ser melhor...
People find it so hard to just call it what it is lol. Shit. Just shit. Made 2 good albums then thought they were the fuckjng Beatles or been possessed by David Bowie. It’s just shite. But you go ahead and call them geniuses 😂
still sad cause i cant buy the ticket of their concert in my country :( love much
I wanna see they play hello you live
Erm, yeah, nah
keren
Como pode, de uma álbum inteiro só salvou duas músicas, essa e body paint!
What is this shite?
Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball? You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment when you look them in the eyes And say, "Baby, it's been nice" So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? La, ohh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
This song warms my heart! ❤️ This performance is perfect!
I love this Jazzy era♥
Jarvis Cocker v2.0
ate que enfim né meu filho...esse album novo tá sofrência purinha kkkk do jeito que a gente gosta
Please bond theme next
Fuck, this stuff is good
The only band No account sosial media individu…respect!!
He looks like a young Sylvester Stallone
que guapo que es !!!.. me encanta TODO de él....... y obviamente el grupo es lo máximo
Alex turner... The modern day lyrical genius
One of the most romantics nights of my life was sound tracked by this song. The way that woman loved on me made me cry. Came way tooo close to asking her to marry me
I love you Alex
Artimonki?
It’s like they took THBC and launched it up on steroids.  It felt like Turner was acting in THBC and he has now assumed Mr. Schwartz in this album. It’s so so different but just sounds so damn good. Long live the boys.
Genios!!!
I like their new music especially the car LP, but I wish there was a tad less kitch on the vocals
Absolute class.
This album is so bloody good. Next bond theme.
Gente como isso é fino e belo... Senhoras e senhores 🍷🗿
Alex is adorable in his high heels 😂
I would love to see an album of the live versions
In the past, I thought TBH was the best. But after trying this album. I like it than TBH. 😂
The album shows how much our flourescent adolescents have matured over the years, absolute perfection.❤️🔥
Necesitaba oír esta canción… un bálsamo para mis oídos… un viaje 🧡
Alexander has such a presence. His posture, his pauses, the way he accentuates some notes, how his body language expresses everything without having to exaggerate...Perhaps I'm the one exaggerating but I love everything about this performance and how he handles this.
Alex messed up w the lyrics lol  But this is a masterpiece… songwriting and vocals can’t get better.
Debe ser muy difícil cargar con el peso de ser la mejor canción del año
What is this synth effect you here in the background? Anyone know?
A band that has grown up as they’ve grown up
excelente
I have never really been a massive fan of arctic monkeys. It’s never too late because this song have got me into listening to their new album. A perfect first track to their new album, it’s emotional and that’s really me as a person. His voice and the band made a beautiful track
What fukin happened to AM
Get back to being a proper exciting band. Pretentious shite now
depressive music
this is shite m8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs-MelnhmC0
this is a beautiful performance and honestly the best i've heard the bois in like a decade, but the shot of jools 3:50  brooding like he's a musical director had my laughing
Always loved them, no matter in what form. They still stay themselves and never disappoint. I love to enjoy their musical essence shining through different prisms. Huge respect for them not being afraid to change. And they age like wine
Love it people who don't enjoy the new sound please evolve.   An artist can't stand still that leads to stagnation.
Good to see bands trying different stuff. Scott walker vibes off this. Not bad
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Od-piSsF5XUkD7n6r-4gw
this song is soooo aaaah 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💝💝💝💌💌💌💌💌😭😭😭
Slow Down, Speed up. xx
So proud that I grow with you boys.
The Car, which is superb, btw, is a real slow burner, but I loved this song from the start. Best track on the album, and one of the finest things they've ever done.
esta canción es hermosa weoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon, la amo <3
This is son is perfect
Lead singers hair looks like Bryan Ferry from the 80's (and now).
Good lord! Who knew Hugh Jackman was such an amazing singer?😳
Μasterpiece
now that's a nice sweater
Love this song soooo much! It’s a classic hit! Will become timeless.  ❤
AM first album was good but the songs have gone downhill since then.
jaimeeee  daaamn
Incredible song and live performance. Has the perfect intro... hard to pull of live. This is what music should be like, a well-crafted piece, (and album).
I was never a fan of AM as the indie rock they were playing in their early years is not exactly my thing. But I can't resist the melancholiac charm of the new album. As many people mentioned in the comment section, the way this band has matured is second to none. Not that many talents can find peace with growing up and evolving. This album is an amazing piece of art. Definitely goes to my vinyl collection.
Los acabo de ver en el corona capital y la canción se escuchó simplemente hermosa, es una obra maestra !!!!!
Oh my God! What a song!
much love for this
Demostrando un estilo unico, es realmente como las bandas se convierten en clasicos, marcando una epoca en la musica mundial, profesionalismo y madurez
What a fine man Alex Turner is. Like, God Damn
He ain’t a writer!
No sé que habrá pasado en los últimos veces en la vida de Alex Turner para haber escrito ese pedazo de maravilla y ver en sus ojos el recuerdo de lo que pasó, le vibra el alma cuando canta esta canción y sobrio... o al menos eso parece...
Classy 🍻
Excellent Show................................Alex........................and his Band............................................What a sense.............
The best band ever
why there are no crying lightning anymore? dangerous animal or secret door?
wow - these guys are evolving into perfection
Prefer LSP
It's not often a song comes on the radio and you notice every single second of it.
They seem to effortlessly perfect any genre of music. Some fine shit.
Pure class. Sounds like something from the artists back in the 50's and 60's. A damn masterpiece. Love it. Makes me cry.
I love this so much
This is hauntingly beautiful. It echoes in my soul long after its over...
Cuando llega a la parte del Coro, suena tan celestial, también resaltar ese sonidito Durante toda la canción, y ni hablar de la Intro😍, preciosa canción.
Me encanta su música es tipo a los años 50 , increíble ❤️
his voice is fucking amazing
I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS SONG AND THIS PERFORMANCE. PLEASE HELP!!!!!
This band has matured perfectly. So, lucky to have grown up listening to their music.
This song has a grammy nomination!! Let's go for it!!
What happened to Alex and why is he now 86 years old
The best song 😮‍💨❤️
3:00 same vibe as the Brazilian king Roberto Carlos
Simplemente perfectos!!!
Ainda nem acredito que fui no show deles. Realizei um sonho
Alex Turner sings so well. But in interviews where he just as to speak I've noticed he finds it hard to form proper sentences sometimes, or finds it hard to put words into what he's thinking. Music is definitely the way he expresses himself.
Probably the best front man around. Always had a soft spot for them and now they’ve taken it to a whole new level with tracks like this!
Alex Turner is the best Lyricist of his generation but I hate these type of tunes he is doing now. This is just a follow on from that last awful album....
Tranquility Base took a good few listens for me to really get into but it has become my favourite AM album. So even though I didnt immediately click with this song and album I just knew if I gave it time and i'd love it. And now I do. It's amazing. Some of the best most enduring music often takes a little effort. Whilst catchy songs you immediately love often get boring quickly.
So damn sad their tickets for Austin were too expensive for me to buy and travel to see them :(  Lucky I got to see them back in 2013
I've just noticed a bono vibe coming from Alex there 👍
I love this song
It took a lot of listens for me to finally appreciate this album. Glad I didn't just put this album aside after the first listen, it's grown on me
Incredible album. It reminds me so much of what The Walkmen were up to right after disbanding. This band has aged so well.
No band has kept it as consistent for this many years, The soundtrack to my life and winter has come upon me and I am satisfied
What a freaking awesome voice!! Holy shit
Im not a huge arctic monkeys fan (i love a few of their songs tho) and nor do i like their more recent style direction (personal taste), but this song is very beautiful and i can see it becoming very timeless. I also never clocked how quality / impressive alex turner's voice is until i heard his falsetto here. Very nice.
this song is just a masterpiece
never got these lads
very very nice
Might be their best live performance on recording. They’ve aged like fine wine. 🍷
Como me lo recetó el Doitor
His voice! Woow wow!
Thank you Arctic Monkeys
Such a beautiful song ❤
One of the best songs in years.  Brilliant
Magic moment, Magic voice, excellent sound quality music. Thank you BBC music. Good time for you.
Flippin eck. This sends shivers up my spine.
absolute drivel
A veces..I Think..me copy...
Such a  beautiful melancholic masterpiece, my personal favourite from the album
What a great sound
wow!
🎶XOXO 💚'🍀🎶
What a star
How they have fallen
This one could fit a James Bond movie perfectly. Incredible song as usual!
Don't know how they went from producing some of the best music ever to this.
Realmente todos los días la escucho, es algo que me transmite una calma y tocó de nuevo en la realidad. Una excelente canción de los arctic, en vivo es sublime, sobre todo cuando llega a la parte de que que la acompañe al auto, y el corazón lleno de tristeza, impresionante. Cómo creció la banda y como crecimos todos, al menos yo recuerdo que cuando estaban en sus acordes más locos, con AM, Fluorescnt, y luego 505, tenía 16-17 y hoy a mis 24 los sigo escuchando y me sigue generando lo mismo, es algo muy lindo. Cómo un buen vino, va mejorando con los años la banda, y sobre todo Alex, como juega con su voz, me siento muy feliz de decir que estoy en este momento, aún escuchándolos, y seguir viendo que producen material tan sublime, de una calidad muy especial, en una actualidad musical que parece ir en decadencia. En fin, es de lo mejor que escucharán en vivo, en una buena banda
HHOOOOOO YOURE MINE MOTHER FUCKERS!!!!!!
Good attempt at turning into Scott Walker or Talk Talk
This song is not good. Trying to be like Andersen Pak and it just ain’t happen’n
In search of lost time
Su nuevo álbum es una delicia, los quiero mucho monos 😻😻😻😻
the melody of the main vocal is soooooooooo bad
instant classic
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Anyone else get the impression Matt is bored to death on the last two albums. His drumming is under utilised so much, but I do love this new record.
I cant even watch this. It really takes my breath away it is from another world
Who killed artic monkeys and replaced them with this depressing crap
Great music if you have problem to sleep
I love seeing how AM is always reinventing itself and exploring new sounds, how Alex's voice has improved over the years and how versatile it is♥
Ahora lo veo una versión envejecida de the Last shadow of Puppets, Sublime ~
Zzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzzz
incredible
Amo con el alma este tema  Pero eso del amor nc hasta q parte es real arctic monkeys forever
Pure class 👍
My god the way alex hit those high notes put tears in my eyes🥹🥹🥹
don't get emotional
It's funny how people try to justify that they now like this 70's tune
I've been amazed by Arctic Monkeys since Beneath the Boardwalk. The first time I heard them I was blown away, and feel the same way now. LIstening to them is like being immersed in a brilliant work of fiction. Transcendental.
Alex's falsetto at the end is the most beautiful thing I've heard <3
O(+>
These guys inspire me to keep at my songwriting and being creative with music,I really should be in a band,its a tuff biz though
3:58 I love how he is pointing out there is no mirrorball. It's in the title jools, he asked for one thing
What a performer Alex turner is
what synth do you use?
This is a song i'd love to dance at a wedding
Dude is so talented !! 😭 He can’t make a bad song & the vocals >>>
Are all these positive comments bots? New album is dirt
🎶✨🎶✨🎶✨🌬️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
the best! Alex you are very beatiful.💘
Super-smooth singing!
Guys I don’t think alex likes this song
What a beautiful song!
Maluco tá a cara do Roberto Carlos.
absolutely yes
I was hoping after they went down this lounge music route on the last record they would kind of evolve it to include their classic style on this new album, but its more of the same. Oh well, i,ll wait for the next record and see what happens.
Even with many instruments this song is pretty boring, same the new album, and that happened cause Alex said that they never will sound like AM again :| fatal error.
Trip hop
Love early artic monkeys .I wouldn't pay a fiver to listen to their utter dross of the past ten years
this shit is lazy      what kind of d rugs are you on
black light animals    way better
This song is magic...
this song is sooooooooooo beautiful. got those notes that make you emotional. he can say TBHC was inspired by the piano, but this album is inspired by his vocals. gorgeous notes. he is in control of his voice.
Nice
Turner eclipsing casablancas , albarn, either Gallagher, whoever you could name. he's the man rn
Have something of Blow Monkeys!
Absolutely fantastic
he knows hes fit
Arctic Monkeys music go with every type of mood you have. They guys are my fav band, they are soo artistic and genuine.
Some slick bass lines in this live version.
what ra sudeep, showing too much ****
❤
What a STUNNING performance by the whole band. ❤
It's a superb new sound. And respect is due to Alex for his homage to 1990's Richard Madeley.
Which episode was this from please can’t find it on Sky
Vassilis din Ano Rahula Lerou dedică prietenilor săi români din North Kolopetinítsa Mannheim. Te iubesc!
la maduración musical perfecta de una banda y Alex no es la excepción, el drama, melancolía y elegancia de esta canción me tiene atrapado hace días y después de ver el segundo video de esta canción en el "Later with Josh Holland" termine de convencerme de que esta banda no tiene techo y saben cómo reinventarse y enamorar al público que no es de guitarras electricas y baterias duras, chapeau para Arctic Monkeys!!!
Te amo Alex
His vocal timbre is not far away from Martin Fry.
Majestic performance of a gorgeous song.  Album-wise, I think it’s brilliant up to half way and then peters out a little, which is a shame as I genuinely think it is half way to being a Bowie level record. Some fantastic content in there.   On a separate note, there appears to be a high correlation between people who fancy Alex Turner and people who call him “a genius” 😂  You don’t have to justify a new musical direction as some sort of complex genius guys, it’s just a band challenging (and enjoying) themselves and their craft.   Enjoyed this performance a lot, good work AM
Se escucha al intro "déjenme si estoy llorando" Angeles Negros jaja
If you like Arctic Monkeys (specifically their AM sound) check out my band's new single 'Lure' here - https://youtu.be/urrSg6wK-yY
This album is pure garbage. It’s okay to be inspired by Bowie, Scott Walker, blue-eyed soul, etc. but this is a weak parody of what it’s trying to be. Drab. Dirge-like. What a waste of all the lovely orchestration.
So beautiful, include their attitude. I’m so proud wiz their old fun.
Little early on those half note stabs eh Jamie?
Alex Turner its so hot 🔥
Is it that the band looks at Matt raising his hand to lead the tempo in the intro for the isolated strokes ?
👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤👨‍🎤
I tried to like this but I can't stop laughing 😂
Huge shit. Please take us back the real AM.
I've ver heard this before bit it's ace.
miss the old arctic monkeys
Previous album felt like I was in an elevator. This one feels like I’m on the right floor. All 10 of them.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
First time I heard this I knew I’d like it so much…
Good job they never came out with this lounge Lizard rubbish to start with, run out of ideas I think. They ‘re not the first, look at The killers.
Sounds like a James Bond tune
what microphone are they using on main vocal?
Love that sound , voice , look ❤
Can someone who loves this album please tell me what you like about it so I can copy your opinion
This is song is on another planet. Might be one of my favorite songs ever made. It's just perfect in so many ways.
Loving it so much! GORGEOUS tune!
This is just perfect, the soundtrack for autumn melancholy. Binge listening the whole album ❤
This track has hit me by surprise, had written the Monkeys off. Sensational song, sensational performance. Mr. Turner reminds me here of Antonio Gades in Carmen.
like we say in french: LA Classe !
😭😭😭
Don’t know why people are getting so shirty about their new album. It has some truly astounding moments - and this performance epitomizes that. Don’t look back to what was - look forward to what’s to come ❤
The band trust, good music is never fade.
Yesterday's still leaking through the roof. Love that line.
He’s just a caricature isn’t he 😂 Dear oh dear.
love how Alex pronounces every word in the vocals, super performance 💚
West End show type music.
crap
Superb!!!
Love this album’s sound
En boucle...morceau de l'année
Vernon Kay’s vocals are absolutely superb!
They are at a very high level, both in quality and in attitude. And it's something to be thankful for in these times. If you like music, buy this album
Alexxxx
Only one song from this set? I wanna hear Hello You.
This is archeology not music. They are talented emulators. I love the originals, sorry mates.
I cannot stand these pretentious people.
above expectation.
Tek kelime ile harika...
услада для ушей
Absolutely fantastic, that's a performance of an artist who knows he's become at his best 👌
The sexy little… swine is dead ☹️
Never gotten to like the album even though I really wanted to, but this one's good. Much respect for Alex and the gang for pushing the direction they want to without restraints. They've proven themselves enough over the years, after all.
i cant handle this
very old fashioned. synth kind of spoils it tbh
Brilliant
This and Body Paint are my favs from their new album.
I love it ! ❤
At first listen this sounded like ass. After a few listens, it grew on me and now I like it
This has a very George Michael feel to me, I would've loved to hear him sing a cover of this.
This is an amazing performance. It takes the song to another level in my opinion. Beautiful job ❤
SHHHHHH....... CONGRATULATIONS FOR THIS MUSICAL EVOLUTION GREAT BAND I LOVE THEM
Stunning. Absolutely stunning. Hi from Malaysia 🤝
i cant believe how beautiful this is
write and play what you want but haven't listened to you since album #2 and this isn't going to change that
It's official.  Alex is now a lounge singer.
Just like what Alex said to the fans who hated the new album: "Don't get emotional..."
He looks like Prince Eric in the Ariel Disney film
Serenity 2022, manliness is back thanks to Putin and Alex
wow this is fantastic
Not a fan of the way they've gone.... 🤔
In love with his voice … in love with this “new” band to me ! Bravo to their courage to innovate after all these years! ❤❤❤
Reminds me of Vic Reeves' pub singer on Shooting Stars.
Without words.......................................................Alex interpretatin..........................and Artics Band.........................
This song is beautiful bruh 🥺 like I cry listening to it
Greatest
I disliked this song terribly when i first heard it. Its now one of the best songs ive heard in years.
BORING ZZZZZZ
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
i feel like mirrorball represents a miracle, something that we all hope for when we know things are meant to go wrong. say if the date doesn't go well and you know this would be the last time you'll see them, both of you walking towards the car, you're hoping that there's this one thing that can distract you from that lonely ride back. 'I can't wait for next time', 'Call me when you get back', a mirrorball.
I imagine Miles dancing around the room with Alex lol
Tony Danza looks good for his age
the vocals Mason, it's all about the vocals.
The maturation of this band is something special.
Seems like Alex's channeling Bowie. The new album is incredible by the way.
He seems so douchey but I like his voice. He's a weak version of Hugh Jackman
I absolutely adore The Car. It's a perfect album. I love Matt Helders' drumming on this record. It's so refined.
WAnted Arctic Monkeys, rockindie
😍😍😍😍
enjoying an album is about the personal experience we all have different tastes and opinions about what kind of album arctic monkeys should produce, as I've got older and more mellow I've really come to enjoy their more laid back romantic cinematic esc music, and at this time and junction in my life its perfect, when I was younger a more guitar heavy rebellious sound was what my life needed so I believe as the individual grows so does their musical appetite,  if everyone liked the same style then the world would be a very bland place...
💛
Art
Crazy Alex has turned Matt helder from one of the great rock drummers too a slow simple rhythm drummer
Che schifo 🤮🤮🤮🤮
that is one tough piece for vocals. I don't think we appreciate enough mr Alex for absolutely owning it.
Definitely one of the best their song
Pretentious? Moi!?
I can say I miss favourite worst nightmare or humbug. But… this is different, thanks for this evolution and I love this.
You are PERFECT! ❤️‍🔥
my maaaaaaaaaaaan
Great work guys, very an Air of Robert Palmer, lots of finesse, keep it up, highest vibes from Erks Inner City.....
❤️‍🔥💥❤️‍🔥
I must listen to this song 4-5 times a day, proper addicted lol
This is fuckin class as fuck, deserves its own fuckin movie, brafuckinvo
I can't stop listening to this song!, it transports you to a better comfy place, where something new is just starting...
Lyrically it's better every time, even when I think they've already hit the zenith. Musically.. This sounds like some earlier record from them that I didn't particularly like. Not that this matters, I like their choice to experiment and reinvent themselves even if the new inventions do not necessarily suit my personal taste. I'm still eager to hear them. You never quite know what to expect with them, it keeps you waiting and guessing
Fucking awful
bebito fiu fiu better
I'm glad the bois are still doing, and can still survive, off of what they're doing. I truly wish they kept with the Humbug style of things instead of the Suck it and See route, people always think it's AM that sealed the deal - Suck it and See was the first dive into this slower, lounge-esque style - clearly early EPs/first 2 album style wasn't going to last forever, the guys have aged and matured. I miss seeing Matt really play the drums, but obviously the focus on the music has shifted. I wish I liked TBMAC more but I just can't get into it - maybe this new album will hit different but I don't see this going any diferently than the last record for myself.  Thanks for the hundreds of hours of entertainment and a great journey. Top 3 band in high school and still in my top 15 of all time personally - I just haven't been able to get into the "new" direction. Full respect, and even though the past few haven't hit me, I can't wait to see what you do next.  Side note - Alex in the past decade has consistently reminded me of a mate I used to be in a band with in their style and it's always thrown me lol. It's not a diss, but it's 100% not a compliment either.  God speed, Monkeys  -An OG Arctic Monkeys fan
Sublime
I can envisage an Arctic Monkeys 'Red (2006-2013) and Blue (2018-  ) Album' release in maybe 2028? John Cooper Clarke was spot on, they are the nearest thing to The Beatles we are likely to see.
My favorite from the album
I am really into this band lives
You just wanna be an object that Alex touched. Like a microphone in this video. Especially at 3:06 seconds.
this is art
This is how The Beatles would’ve sounded like if they made music in the 1970’s
They definitely move on with each new piece of music. It's all interesting which is more than I can say for alot of bands.
Cannot stand them their new music.
Cant believe he left Bayern for Barca
I love that Flight of the Conchords are back again
I think ive watched this 100 times in a row
Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball? You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment when you look them in the eyes And say, "Baby, it's been nice" So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? La, ohh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
Alex’s voice has changed to sound like Martin Fry from ABC. ( a reference probably lost on many I know😂)
I love this song so much! So smooth.
alex kicks ass now his voice A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
Ya vi este video mil veces y amo como se ve Alex cantando
Elevator music
Great song.  Alex? Damn he’s so hot.
Wow. Love it.
Spliff time
I listened to The Car 4 times on 4 different drives to work, on an extremely high quality sound system turned up very loud. I listened very intently, and carefully. There's no fun to be had. It's boring. It's not what I enjoy in music. I'm not saying it's good or bad, but to me it's just not enjoyable. The problem is that I have enjoyed Arctic Monkeys music so very much in the past, so there's an expectation that the new stuff is going to be what I like. At the end of the day that expectation is unfair to them. They can make whatever they like, and they will. There's no accounting for taste.
Ok pour les fans qui aimeront quoiqu’il arrive. Pour les mélomanes, il faut avouer que c’est déjà entendu, voire ré-entendu, et un peu plat…
It's a bit dated
Elevator music
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Ashcroft was right. The drugs really don’t work.
This version compared to the album is in a different dimension, and honestly, really pays its justice.
Sounds better in a live setting. It's not a great album. I'm happy they tried one concept album... But this feels like a continuation of the same concept without refining what worked and didn't. This is aimless drivel that goes nowhere.  No wit, no bite. It's flaccid at best from their previous albums. It may work in a few situations but it's not an easy or an enjoyable listen. 3/10
Awesomeness
I think the opening line of this song is a nod to all those good time fans that dont stick around for the real stuff...they all want the mirror ball , its all about the realtionships that seek excess to exist  the whole song reeks of expectations,  the moment you look them in the eyes and say baby its been nice..  good bye to the old me..
This is absolutely first class
Can't wait to hear this live next yr!!!
Esse album é maravilhoso pqp Simples assim Arctic monkeys se tornou minha banda favorita nos últimos anos
This song is a big pile of 💩
Arctic Monkeys have taken a trajectory akin to David Sylvian and Talk Talk. The music they make now is pure art. They make it for themselves. It's absolutely sublime. Effortlessly beautiful with a confidence that The Beatles had in their later albums. I speak as someone that was suspicious of their early work. They seemed over hyped, but I was wrong.
I am obsessed with this song!
Currently spinning the new album on vinyl on my vintage technics hifi stack. Sounds absolutely brilliant.
ME ENCANTA!!!!❤
MOST BORING SONG EVER ! nice job
This is magic 🖤
Wow this Song is amazing live!🥰😱
I like Arctic Monkeys, but it sounds to me boring and pretensious like the last release
this is too good i love it so much
Holy crap- amazing stuff.  So far I prefer the live takes to the studio version of these songs.  But it's nice for a young(ish) band to show such ambition and go in a unique direction like this. What a performance....
Temazo
Morceau absolument délicieux
Definitely one of the only tracks from The Car I actually remembered after finishing the record so it's nice to see it being performed like this
I think their new sound got a Scott walker vibes
God damn this is a masterpiece of a song by the Artic Monkeys.
Perfection
Dios mío que belleza
So can we please be absolutely sure, that there's a mirrorball... foooooor meeeeeeeeeee? Dude, goosebumps
Love it.
ooo
Awesome!!
Estoy total y completamente enamorado él!
Remember when these guys made rock music? groundbreaking post-punk bangers that changed British rock forever? Yeah, I miss those days too.....
Sorte de estar vivenciando essa era ❤
❤
this song is fucking unbelievable seriously guys come on this shit is magic
Absolute rubbish
What the hell happened to these guys? They used to fucking rock! This is generic top 40 crap sucks
LEGENDARYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
They are amazing I love how they just do what they want! Still I feel like it's important to listen a few times to get it! Then it makes sense.
never know that lewandowski can sing that good haha
Arctic Monkeys are doing a great extra effort promoting this album. I'm a big fan of their music and also of the marketing strategy carried out. Fans are growing and changing with these lads. Congrats!
Perfection
Absolutely brilliant music by an amazing band.
Bit too self-indulgent for my liking
Feels more like a solo album this one
1:10 - Come on man, you could have played at least two more shakers 😅
God, what a GORGEOUS human being
This album just works.
3:35 Alex Turner has ascended
It's insanely hard to sing along with any songs on this record lol. His phrasing it so crazy and one of a kind. I've decided to just kind of jam along lolol
Is he wearing that same sweater.... I want your autograph....
yet again, alex turner in grandpa fit 😍😍
1:10 Manager: How many Maracas do we buy? AM: Yes
Lift music
king crimson + zigi amalgamation and still very unique [good ! i can get out of my paper bag and breath again for witnessing there is such a good music out there]
in vain to wait for 2006, depression within the group does not stop
songs like this can make you addicted
Beautiful song and melody. So attractive!
Mi cancion, osea lit, la amo, me encanta, es mi soporte...
I miss the old Arctic Monkeys
Bit boring.
arctic monkeys tqm
Fiona Apple vibes
I liked it, I won't say it's the best album they've made, but I like that they change, personally I like bands like Pink Floyd or Radiohead...so let's say I'm used to drastic musical change...it's understandable that many don't like the new album...but it's always good for them to experiment musically. They have been running for 20 years now. Impressive 👏🏻
Perfection
It's weird to see Alex Turner without a suit, tonight he let Barney stinson down
Why doesn’t Matt do the stops on the 4th beat on the hi hats like on the record? I really felt like that’s what gave the track its groove 🤷🏼‍♂️
THE LIVE VERSION >>>>>
Just poseurs
Bit like Dion in his later stuff with Spector.
Eles cresceram, muito.. todas as fases são especiais e tem suas peculiaridades , mas essa em especial com muitos arranjos e a voz inconfundível.. obrigada
What a shame, from the best band in the world to, well.. this. You’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a Partridge sketch
O menino Alex ta ficando velho, amigos! E nós também.
It's almost as if they have a contempt for the music that got them here... it's a shame.
possibly one of the worst albums ive ever listened to. and I LOVE Arctic Monkeys AM album. Tranquility was okay. But The Car should be renamed "The HotTrash" i feel like i'm getting punk'd when anyone says they like it.
banda maravilhosa ❤🇧🇷
💎
I don't know what they are anymore but It isn't good
Brazil loves u guys💘🤧
gracias por tanta Belleza! gracias Arctic Monkeys !
can't come to terms with the mustard v neck
Música maravilhosa! Álbum perfeito... Obrigado Arctic Monkeys ❤
I first fell in love with Arctic Monkeys because they made thousands of people sing in live concerts etc etc  How will this song (or the album in general) be enjoyed by live crowds
such a great band they are. alex always manages to move me like no one else
really sad they think this is good
Harika şarkı. Sonunda live versiyonunu da dinleyebildik..
Art galery date with this song sound good!!!!
Can't wait for the 'Alex Turner looking for his mirrorball' video compilation 2:10
What a pile of shit
god, this song is absolutely perfect. alex will always be my favorite singer
Wow
Can we please take a moment to appreciate how humble Yellamo is. Always does his best in the background ❤️ regardless of his basement experience 😅
On repeat. All day long.
love the Bob Holness hairstyle
ta lindo dmss mds.... TBHC Part2
Give it up shocking performance
Me encanta 😍
Россия — священная наша держава, Россия — любимая наша страна. Могучая воля, великая слава — Твоё достоянье на все времена!

OMG es este el mejor tema de AT? El rey sin corona, el profeta, el hombre sexo, artimonki hasta la muerte
Love that his stage presence/persona changes each album. This one is more still and present  and I like it.  He's become such a great performer.
they are really putting in the miles to promote this fantastic album!
And it's far better than most of the shite out there
It my not be fast but its a bloody great tune I will be getting the new album 👍
😍😍😍
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy
i love the slight electric undertone to this performance
man, i really dig their later stuff. hope they keep making music for years to come!
A heavy performance.
I've gone from, 'this is terrible' to 'this is one of my favourite AM songs'. Love the new album.
It's so different from the ukrainian monkeys on gayrovision earlier this year! Fantastic! :)
Absolutely in love🥰
Is it just me but hasn’t Alex Turner become super pretentious ? I just don’t get all this fandom .He comes over as a very annoying individual these days . A bit of humility might be worth a try next time he decides on taking on another persona?
I can’t stop listening to this song. It’s just wonderful
what a song
Beautiful
What the fricken cheese-hell is this?!? Man, they were so great back then, what happened to these guys?
In the 2nd, 3rd and 4th bar of the song, the 4th beat in the guitar dramatically rushes... every single time.
This has got faith no more written all over it..
We like the music that connects with our souls that's why Arctic Monkeys making whatever they like and not caring about popularity is one aspect of myself too it feels sometimes that they're representing my own life's soudtrack, proud of their evolution and of their achievements, eternally loving them and yeah, heaven is listening to this amazing band everytime, keep streaming this masterpiece of album ☄️
Wow, fucking incredible.
if the band wasn't arctic monkeys I'd be okay with this song
<<3
Musicians sound at their best or near best on Jools's programmes.  This is a fabulous performance.  Arctic Monkeys are quite unique.  Excellent
This live version should be on Spotify laaawd
i feel bad for this generation. not only that new music sucks, they get watered down versions of great bands like arctic monkeys, paramore etc
Not sure why but always preferred Snow Patrol over AM but they seem pretty popular now heading Glasto 23
😍😍😍
This song is perfect
I dont know
There'd better be a good band on next time as this put me to sleep.
Is it AM most pretentious album yet? Yes.. but do you love it?.. I’m obsessed.  AM arrogance it’s granted after that master piece.
Amazing how his voice sounds as good, if not actually better, in these guest appearances too
Love this!
I would say one of the best performances I’ve ever seen.
much prefer  the old stuff guys turned into a helmet ⛑️
This has all the hallmarks of a Fast Show sketch
Stunning, a beautiful live performance. The more I listen to this album, the more I love it.
amo esta canción
Increible
incredible, easy and smooth yet so intense at the same time. its a track where i cant put my finger on why i love it so much, but theres just something about it. Took me a long time to get into the 'tranquility-era' sound, but i love it now. makes me want to sit in a dark lounge with antique lamps, a glass of whiskey and a smoke : )
te amo alex
this is the best arctic monkeys' song ever made.
epic.
Es exquisita la manera en que Alex Turner canta, define y crea un ambiente de melancolía, nostalgia y placer para los sentidos! Los arreglos, el sonido, la frescura de su imágen, su voz, todo hace que se escuche mágico! 🥰
if this was an unknown band nobody would care about this.
Fucking amazing !!!
Not for me
Glad to see them back in top form after their previous shitty record. Never try to be someone you are not.
If you don't like this record go and check their old stuff, us who grew up with them understand this
la unica cancion buena culeroooss
I love this song 🎧
csm suenan nivel d10s
Speed 1.5 (the best version) 😉
Maestros
I just love how Alex has morphed into a Northern Club Circuit singer a la Vic Reeves in Shooting Stars. BUT, a very good one at that. Very 1970's Stockton -on -Tees.
Beautiful song, great album. Nice to have this on 2022.
Too trying to be AMERICANA… overweight in this wannabe American sad seventies middle age crooner
Pero que hermosa canción.... Neta... Se encuentran tantas emociones... Saludos desde México... Un gran fan de esta Gran banda... ❤️🎶🤠
Alex have such  great voice on the world
I think there will be alex
Alex’s vocals here are powerful as fuck
Greattt
Just wow🤗
Awful. Like a drunk karaoke singer. Will they ever write an actual tune again?
What a front man 🎉
the last shadow monkes
what a crap of album. I fall asleep
almost hypnotic
i love it
Best album of 2022, and i don't say this lighlty. The entire album is full of beautiful, crisp, and well-crafted songwriting.
how many times did u watch this?  me : yes
good music is making a comeback, the originals win in the end
The Car Album is basically leaving Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino....in  *the car* carry on the phenomenally beautiful music.
more
Look at him! Learned how to control his body while singing with no instruments in hands! Good job, Alex!
Beautiful
Elevator music
The mix on this is outstanding, this version is so good
A voz dele está incrível.  Ele está cada vez mais bonito e talentoso
Impressive stuff
La mejor banda de rock
I'm stuck in the past and find it hard to find new music I love.  But this album kills me and this is the best track on it - so beautiful and melancholic.
Love how how clearly and precisely he pronounces every word.
Perfeita!
don't believe the hype, my ass
The downward spiral continues...
Pretty sure melancholy is just another word for dog sh*t. It’s so bad it’s laughable.
This song is class, not sure why but it is! Arctic monkeys just drop gem after gem
Is this Arctic Monkeys or The Last Shadow Puppets?  Or it is ALEX TUNER'S EXPERIENCE???
Trash
Lost in the cult of identity, Scott Walker legacy
Loved it!😍
Incredible love love and respect for this incredible music I love so much
I LOVE YOU ARCTIC MONKEYS ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don`t get it. I want to...But i just don`t.  This song is nice enough, not hating..
Best intro to any song I've heard this year, and the other comments are right, you need good speakers or headphones to appreciate 100% 👌🏻
a mimir 💤
Love Alex voice on this track just beautiful
When a band ends up so far up there own bottoms
Similar to the last record, you have to submerge yourself, lights off curtains shut and enjoy, massive fan of both the record and the Monkeys, but let’s be honest, if either of the last 2 albums were their first, it wouldn’t get the reviews it has, which isn’t a criticism, but quite a paradoxical
Miss that AM sound :(
It's criminal there's so much talent in one band
beautiful performance
This could be the peak of their music career, and it's simply beautiful.
2:58 omg Alex, hi😳
Música para dormir
Best song in the album
radiojed es mejor
They are Born for this
Absolute masterpiece
❤️ 🔥 🔥 🔥 ❤️
Definitely influenced by Richard hawley
Their sound production and band lineup for their live shows are simply perfect. True quality and no cuts for relying on digital/non live sound like many modern concert performances go
Fucking fantastic tune. The lads always deliver.
Simply sublime
This is a great record
They sound great!!
MEUSSS
Alex Turner is a genius.
Omg the Vocals unbelievable
Great performance! What a beautiful song! These guys... always making the best!
So fkg good
this has got to be my favourite song on the album- it’s so bittersweet and yet i don’t know what for.
my favorite song from The Car so far
I CANT, I LOVE THIS
Such a gift to have such a high quality recording of this live on TV. The stage and camerawork gives it all the gravitas this track deserves. Gorgeous 💛
I love these guys so much for many years but the rest of the band members minus the singer look insanely bored lol. They're so talented, such a shame they decided to go this route. It honestly feels like an Alex Turner solo song.
BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!
moon boy over starman
Holyyyyy shittt, It's way better live
geniuses
I'm so happy they kept Tyler Parkford on keys!
5 stars out of 5
pasan los años y suenan cada vez mejor , agradecida de ser contemporánea a esta banda del bien!
Oh my goodness this song sounds perfect live ♥ Alex's singing skills never dissapoints us, can't wait to listen the new album in Argentina 🥰
Meh
Live performances are always much better than the studio version.
lame
Almost any new AM video will be full of comments vehemently defending the quality of their last two albums on the premise that it is ‘new’ and ‘different.’  And before you chew my head off I really like this song and think the new album overall is good. They aren’t a rock band anymore which is fine, that time is over.
The stage decoration and the lights match perfectly with the song
Just realized that this song is not about a romantic relationship - it’s about their relationship with the fans and the music industry. I feel dumb now
His voice is incredible. Unbelievable performance.
Rubbish song prefer there old stuff
Try not to fall asleep challenge [IMPOSSIBLE] 😴😴🥱🥱
The evolution of this band is phenomenal. 👏👏👏
I get the feeling like hes slightly taking the P*** but it still sounds good
amo
Incredible performance
Sound quality is perfect
He ain't no Marvin Gaye that's for sure. He's got to work on his falsetto if this is the direction they are taking. It is growing on me regardless.
Increible
Very romantic and Alex is still handsome dude x
Amazing
new sinatra
To be honest I actually quite preferred the mix of Synths and Electric guitar in place of the real string section at the end here. Also with the live rendition of Big Ideas
Bravo!
If only I had a high end music system to play this properly...This is a masterpiece, vocals, lyrics and music arrangements
3:29 beautiful voice
Live performance at its best, beautiful song I can play anytime on repeat
Beautiful
What a I have just saw.
finally 🤩
Analisas casa instrumento y vez la simplesa de como emocionar al ser humamo que forma de llegar al alma a las profundidades del pensamiento y del sentir, una mamera exquisita de elaborar con detalles super importantes que son la simplicidad. La forma de trasmitir  de Alex es mas aya que solo cantar lo escuchas y literal hace peliculas en tu mente con la armonizacion y la voz de Alex  diciendote las palabras, la musica esta elaborada para llegar a las profundidades de la mente y ellos saben como hacerlo...
Superb.     Brilliant set up an camera work by the bbc crew too.
His voice, his face,the melody and letter of the song, everything is perfect,Alex!😍
This is just amazing 🖤🖤🖤 I can’t wait for the AM Jools special coming in a couple of weeks. For both Jools and the band it must be quite special to go from kickstarting their career on Later with that performance of Dancefloor, to having their own TV special full of beautiful songs like this.   What a journey.   Cheers to Jools and the Arctics for providing such consistently fantastic music over the years.   Long may it continue xx
Thats awful. truly!! Boring as hell!
Like being bathed in honey on a warm summers evening...
Absolutely and utterly beautiful. Classic masterful songwriting. 👌🏼🙏🏽🤟
FODA
Sounds amazing in that hall, don't know how it'll come across in a field at Hillsborough 🤨
this sounds incredible !!!
Sin dudas un deleite de album 🌌🎶💕
Best version i have heard of this song so far... Im sure i will tear up when they play it in Glasgow next June. Mirrorball is beautiful & so is the Arctic Monkeys music ❤ Best band ever!
I don’t care what anyone says. This is just absolutely amazing
Wow
Pretentious poppycock
Pleased my teenage kids heard the songs they did when I listened to them and not this space jazz warbling.
They have hinted at their influences with every album from the start, influences which were always eclectic and beyond their years, now they are embracing them and the result just transcends everything they have done...this is sublime.
Masterpiece
That's amazing
Grammy !!!!
Arctic monkeys the kings) los amo
Amazing album, had it playing non-stop all weekend.
Masterpiece <3
Vocals. Strings. Drums. Heaven.
Alex turner's voice in his maximus evolution
😍😍😍😍😍😍
beyond Alex's flawless performance that says it all in itself, I still can't believe what they are doing. I mean, this was the first song on the album to be announced and I think they did it because this song deserves the world and if it had only been released when the album came out it wouldn't have received the success it has right now. I mean, if they had released sculptures of anything goes instead of mirrorball it would have become more popular. Based on this reflection, I suppose they make music not to have a commercial audience but because they do care more about doing what they actually like and that's the reason why they are my favorite band. Cheers :)
Just stunning! Even better live than on record. BEAUTIFUL 😍👏
як же я вас обожнюю, те що ви змінюєтеся - це прекрасно 💔 і кожна пісня з нового альбому потрапляє до серця, дякую вам!
Boooooring!
brilliant but watching 1975, phoenix and this... the mix just isn't great. weedy. I can hear the empty room and the vocals sound exposed. Anyone else?
This is a great performance, but I feel so bad for Matt and Jamie, it looks so boring to play, nicks part seems alright tbf
Poor Jamie. He looks so bored live, since the TBH+C era.
Arctic Monkeys, mi lugar seguro
I just got pregnant by this astonishing masterpiece of song and performance.
This is great! Beaut vocals by Alex
This album translates so well live. I think I prefer it.
I absolutely love this song <3
I love The new sound, sound like an old Hollywood romantic/dramatic movie 🖤
Alex Dont get emotional.  Me blubbing from the first refrain.
Compare this to say...Brianstorm. There's no way ud think its the same band.
they look like Air and sounds like Scott Walker
CLEAN
The follow up to Sweet Dreams TN
absolutely perfect
Que venha essa música para o Brasil dia 31 em!!!
The last verse touches every part of our body 💛
I really like this song😊!
M A S T E R P I E C E
magical tune. simply beautiful song! i'm really hoping they'll choose it for the brazilian setlists in a couple of weeks
The intro is so Twin Peaks like
The composition of all their songs never fail, there's always so many layers lyrically and instrument wise. Absolutely beautiful :)
To all the people who are still pouring love on arctic monkeys' new music, you guys are adorable. It's fascinating to see so many people with top tier music taste. I love you guys ❤️
Sounding great
Fantastic
arctic monkeys should have quit in 2012. They were goat of the indie scene but this stuff even in it's own genre is embarrasing
Ello from the Philippines!
I love you alex turner
amazing
i love it so much
Sleepy garbage
This whole album is like a series of James Bond themes written about a breakup.
Jools, through his work and shows, probably did more for music than 80% of all selling artists did combined.  And they know it!!
Different…with great instrumentation and mood.
absolute rammer mate
"Have  a heavy heart" Such a amazing using of words
This is probably the hundred time i've listened to this song
Such a privilege to have and listen their music. Bravo! Big hugs from Greece
The mixing was different from the original, the live arrangement was without emotion, in this type of music the mixing is fundamental. but it's still a good live performance.
His voice is wonderful. 😌
I've never seen anyone make love to a microphone that hard!
Arctic Monkeys' fans should be so proud of having one of the greatest bands ever. They always make great music and sound so good live!!
😴😴😴
lol this album
What a flawless vocal performance
Nenhuma outra banda consegue ter uma evolução estética tão boa quanto essa. O Tranquility Base foi um marco, e o The Car está dando continuidade. Olha a atmosfera criada pelas músicas e pela decoração, cara
I wish we could watch jools holland in the states. What an excellent performance
Arctic Monkeys are aging like a fine wine... The Car is an absolutely fantastic album 👌 🔥
goddamn
He reminds of Bowie in the way he creates a different persona each album. He's a very underrated generational talent.
Its a change in direction for sure but for me it's just not the arctic monkeys! I've listened to the car 2 times to try getting it but it's just not happening. The music they produced is outstanding but its background music and the lyrics are absolutely pathetic ,I've never seen a more of sad sight than matt helders playing this shite ,
Sonido exquisito
Late night Style Council. Amazing
Good for Alex , bad for arctic monkeys , I love them but wasted talent, next time they could do an A/B sides album 💿
Woooow....that voice
this is such a beautiful song, sounds even better live!
cringe
The cinematography of this performance- holy shit
¡Hermoso! 🥰👏🏼
This band has never been my cup of tea but I love this track
"look how they massacred my boy" AM are shite now.
Alex parece un profesor de Lengua y Literatura 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Esta versión es para escucharla en el lecho de muerte ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I get emotional every time i hear this song, even though Alex asks us not to. Its way too cinematic and magical. Anemoia💖
GOAT
This song is a gentle wave of melancholy  that flows through my soul.
Consistantly innovative and real. One of the best bands in the last thirty years.
WOW!  I dont know what this band has that's so absolutely amazing!  Other than they're Yorkshire Lads??  But oh come on!  Cool is not the word....and he's gor a jumper on????❤👍❤👍❤👍  SUPERLATIVES ARE SUPERFLUOUS 👌🎼
My fav from the album
I thought this was Robbie williams when i first heard it .
Absolute perfection.
Better live than the album
Vocal melody is dog S##t
Turner is the closest my generation will ever get to having our own David Bowie I’m afraid…  they’ve evolved into something quite remarkable..
perfection
Scott Walker imitation once again then . Always plagiarise from someone who's dead I suppose.
Great performance!
Absolutely awful album and song. Jazz room bullshit
wow the vocals here are top notch
1:37 se adelanta 😫
Fabulous
This has quickly become one of my favorite Arctic Monkeys songs ever, great performance!
This new album is a real slow burner. Took me nearly 37 minutes to appreciate what a masterpiece it is.
I love you guys!!! 🥲❤
If most of the songs on the album were like this one the album could’ve easily been top three they ever made
Quite a journey from punk/rock/pop to that grungy dirty sound of a.m to this lounge-esque music of today. They've basically nailed all aspects of music
A perfect live version
It lacks authenticity at the end of the day. This Alex’s persona is quite pathetic and annoying! it doesn’t work at all, so the music… Man is trying to sing like Cohen or Marvin Gaye but he ain’t got the swag and vox. Such a shame, cos I really used to like them
it's a work of art and I'm here for it
This live performance made me love the song even more. Thank you Arctic Monkeys
This album absolutely must be listened to on a stereo with proper speakers to get the full effect. The musical arrangements on it are outstanding
Sorry AM ,but this is  just cheap ,horrific Robbie Williams style  crooning .
Jools never dissapoints with the sounds of his guest star performance. This is absolutely stellar!
Fantastic song. Shame the album isn’t.
absolute masterclass
This song will be held as one of their greatest - sounds timeless ❤
Great band!! Great song!! ❤️❤️❤️
beautiful beautiful vocals ahhhh
Alex is undoubtedly one of the greatest musical minds of our lifetime. The way he, Matt, Jamie and Nick writes, composes and produces music is simply astonishing. The Car album is truly a masterpiece, so many layers of lyrical genius, instrumentation and vocals that come together in a way that is beyond words. Not to mention, Alex has this beautiful aura about him which adds so much richness to his music. Such a privilege to have grown up with their music <3
Voice just too majestic
Damnnn 🔥 She look so finee !!!
Shades of Scott Walker on this new album.
Song of the year.
d is for delightful
What a great song
Painfully slow
Bro, this is timeless
I'd like to hear full album live - it's stunning...
Such a great song!
arctic monkeys are the definition of following your ideas and don't care about what is popular now, just do what you think is good they have my respect for that.
The synths Is  Korg MaxiKorg
This song is a piece of art
This song is a masterpiece. My fav from The Car. 🤎🇧🇷✌🏻
pesada
the evolution of AM is divine and immaculate
Terrible
The more I listen to it, the more I fall in love with it.
🥱🥱🥱
Zzzz hipócritas los comentarios 😅
This song is sublime
Awesome tune. Reminds me of Scott Walker for some reason
This is a very special song - love every minute!
Wonderful.
i love the way Alex sings this almost like he’s angry, it puts a really different spin on the song
💫💫💫💫
what a lovely live performance alex has never sounded better
i am truly amazed how great and mature this album is <3
In 3:51, jools must be damn proud of them, from a young band performing I Bet You Look Good on The Dancefloor in '06 (which was magnificent) to this more mature and yet another masterful performance by Arctic Monkeys now in '22.
:)
I have this song in repeat for too long 😅
عثل يحبيبي
<3
None of them seem to be enjoying to play this tired, sleepy music...🙄 All songs on the new album sound alike, good lyrics but same tempo, clueless drums, nearly no melody or guitars. Like a band that gave up...
it's just fabulous, so I can't help but be amazed💔
Masterpiece.
2:59 Alex que haces, me asustas! 😓
Lyrics: [Verse 1] Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood  [Chorus] So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball?  [Verse 2] You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment whеn you look them in the eyеs And say, "Baby, it's been nice"  [Chorus] So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
Matt: how many maracas do you want?  Percussionist: yes, more pls!
The acoustics add something haunting and beautiful with that slight echo-yness
I like how Alex stared down the camera and then it switched to a different one, almost as if the camera got shy
This song always makes me feel in another place, in a melancholic better place
I love this song and new direction. Both TBHC and The Car are brilliant. Hi from Toronto
0:40 so that's how they do this part live, everyone look to Matt
Alex Turner turned into the guy he use to sing about in Fale Tales Of San Francisco.

I've listened to them since my 16th birthday when I got their debut as a gift and through all the changes, I still like them very very much. We grew up together I guess. :)
