this song is beautiful
This song with 1.25x is 🪐
No homo
I wish you roses🗣️🗣️
OMGGGGG!!!! THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Not longing for, reminiscing on the memories of a love that was once perfect, but could never be repaired. Not wanting someone back, but wishing the best and holding a place in your heart for them regardless. Heartbreak with growth, but no malice. This song brings me to tears almost every time.
She's Fine
Hispanic summer walker

the bandaged fingers at Crumb Cafe took me out.

Es su canción  pero no lo sabe ...
Does anyone really understand this song it’s about  people with love — whether it’s a friend, a lover, or someone else.  She wants to do this without resentment or bitterness. Letting go doesn’t mean hating, just accept
Esta Artista les encantará es independiente denle apoyo lo merece ❤ https://youtu.be/cuoDOGW7Qy0?si=46KPyw8RCZX2UpgQ

I find it interesting how guilt is capable of drawing tears out of one with such a beautiful sentiment towards a lost love 🥹🥲🥰
Every time I hear this intro, I expect her to sing "llama llama, red pajamas"  Beautiful song though

Love this song!!
2025 June ❤
I just discovered Kali two weeks ago from a reel on instagram singing a lullaby on a radio show. Since I’ve been going down the Kali Uchi rabbit whole and LAWD this song is everything!
in terms of creativity this is still my favorite kali video , never fail to come back to it alwaysssss
Anyone here in June 2025 ? Such a great song.
Eu desejei rosas para meu amor. Que agora não é mais meu amor, pois ele decidiu estar com outra pessoa, te amo Isac ❤😢
🙂‍↔️
I WISH YOU ROSES AND ROSES
Coming after all I can say
After consuming magic shrooms I dedicate this song to my ego. You’re dead to me
She is so much better than Beyonce.. and Taylor Swift .. those birches suck
Love is a dangerous game
Anyone June 2025. I only discovered this song now. Usually how I love discovering my music unexpectedly 😌✨🥰😍
Aidan...
I WOULD say that I wish that Kali had the same money and mainstream success and recognition Doja Cat enjoys. But in reality she really does. Her creativity & talent are unmatched, for me. She's in a lane all her own. No one can touch her.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amo essa 💋💋🌹🌹
WHY AFTER 2 FREAKING YEARS I FIND THIS BANGER😭

from a color theory perspective, the first iteration of that body paint look actually floored me. like, the color choice, the color contouring, the shape language, its just perfect.

Type of songs to listen to late at night car ride
A while back I asked my teacher to put this on as background music not knowing what the music video looked like, and my teacher saw it. The only reason I put it on was because it was clean

mama Llama red pajama
Why the fuck was the first starting like weekend's voice 😭💞
I'm just wondering 🤔 but did u write the lyrics?? " while here I'm someone to honor, when gone I'm someone to mourn". Beautiful 🎶 🎵 either way, very deep.
U have such amazing 👏 🤩 💖 💓 💗 talent and I see you have been signed to Atlantic since I first saw you. I'm glad . I hope your rich now. I can tell you put a lot of something different 💯 in your style.  I was soooo bored with everyone else in the industry.  U totally grabbed my attention and kept it all on u. Haha ❤~Raquella Maria
Sometimes I feel so dumb because I can't hate him, even tho, he lied so much, and that heartbreak has been one of the most difficult things in my life. But this song have helped me to understand that even tho it wasn't okay and I don't have to come back, I can still send him love and that doesn't make me weak and stupid. I just wish him light so he can forgive himself and hopefully be better in the future. And if someone needs loads of love is him, him who doesn't know how to love. I wish you roses
She is like the Female version 9f "Cigarettes after sex"
A bit of Sade on this track.  Nice song
O único comentário em português, te amo kali
top 5 tracks on my spotify wrapped of 2024! top artist of this year too🥹
❤
bawling my eyes to this song, it's so beautiful but sort of emotional at the same time so it makes me cry, very hard.
Simplesmente uma das maiores vozes da atualidade
My idol
Heard this in my favorite coffee shop and Shazam-ed twice!!! The song is drop-dead gorgeous ❤🥹 And yes, roses to you although I do hate you sometimes when I think back to what happened 🌹
My ex sent me this , I sent him Jessie Reyes Merry Nothing‼️
The Queen of enchantresses!! 🌹
I can’t believe Kali is real. She is ancient. Of the most beautiful forms. Anyone who doesn’t like today’s music but overlooks her is blind. Music is alive and well ^
Para ti 🖤 2024
❤
I used to cry to this song now this song brings me peace and makes me happy, I won't lie I feel a respark between us
Su trabajo es verdadero arte 😭😭😭❤
I love this song
Sounds like “y Ahora te jodes” instead of I wish you roses
I never thought I would be without you 😭😭😭

Joe bataan
When we first met, this song had just been released. It became one of my favorites. I never thought I'd end up dedicating it to you. I never thought i would be without you.I wish you love, I wish you well I wish you roses  🥀
❤❤❤❤❤❤
My ex cheated on me and dedicated this song to me then I took her back. Now she ended up leaving me a year later cuz I couldnt overcome my vices and found somebody right after breaking up. Learned my lesson the hard way dont ever give people a second chance cuz they’ll do you worse in the end.

Kali you are a rose also you remind me of my stepsister you kinda look like her she's 14 I'm only 4 years younger then her
Very similar tune to ‘bellows of a lonely giant’ by an artist named The ib   https://youtu.be/eR4zTvK3Tlk?si=1YQdCWjQw-0KzZwb
the irony of today marking what would of been our 6yr anniversary and listening to this song unironically. i still love you, even if youre bad for me... i still love you even though i know the love isnt mutual. ive accepted our relationship is no more.. yet i still grieve us, its not me and you anymore its just me on my own and our lives which was once intwined have now split off into different directions and with each passing day we turn to strangers. this time last year we was together...i had you..and now i dont. rest in peace to  the 17th of july,  itll become just another day to me eventually. ill love you from afar from now on, not because i want to but because i have to.
WHY DOES HER CLOSING INTO THE FLOWER AT THE END REMIND ME OF THE END OF FEARIE SOIREE WHERE MELANIE FALLS ASLEEP IN THE FLOWER AND IT CLOSES????

"Never Thought I Could Be Without You" is the stitch I needed
Video kinda grosses me out. She is a jazz talent. I hope she hooks up with a talented producer in that genre.  Super talent. I'm so impressed.
I LOVED HER MUSIC SHE IS MY FAVORITE SINGER

🎉kaliuchis
I hate myself for just now finding this kind of peace in music 🙄
lets be honest she would eat this years met gala look
I sing this and dont cry anymore such a beautiful song im so thankful for music that has helped me heal I love being able to love again.
Her voice is so different that's what makes you special baby I am soo proud of you!! i can definitely tell the change on her voices and it only keeps getting better and better. Don't ever change baby!!❤
I got this song on repeat baby ❤
My mother!!! Kali you saved my life… I’ve turning and looking to myself carefully, softly and lovely… thanks for show me how beautiful my garden is… I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCH
Beautiful ❤️ song she sings
Absolutely breathtaking. The visuals,voice,message,beat,vibe,body paint!!! Pussy power with a deeper twist! So goooddd!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☮️☮️☮️
Today I dedicated this song to my ex, to be honest I don't know how many times I've said goodbye to her, the difference is that today's farewell was from friendship and not from a relationship. Even though a long time has passed since our romantic relationship ended, it's curious that they continues to give me lessons that encourage me to grow. Literally today I set my first limit, I had never done it and it was the most liberating feeling I've experienced in a long time. Although, it was also terribly painful to notice that we don't even function as friends, we are not made to have contact because we are both in very different moments of our lives, in fact we are in different books. For my part, I just want to finally heal and move on completely, although it was sad, I feel that this will bring a new chapter to my life, where I finally manage to turn the terribly insistent page that she is. I just want to remember it for what it was, a normal relationship with the good, the bad and the ugly, and filled with many teachings, with a lot of emotional growth. Thank you very much for everything you have contributed to my life, for all the teachings you've given me, all the love you gave me, I will always keep it in my heart and I will never forget it. But it is time for us to let each other go, we both have very different goals in life so I'm afraid that our paths will not converge again and for that I am grateful. I wish you roses.  With love. Gret
The Rose dress would have bien perfecto for this year's met gala
(I never thought I would be without you)  I wish you love I wish you well I wish you roses, while you can still smell them...
You’re amazing 🩷
Te amo Kali <3

Kali is the mother of r&b
The way this song found me at the right time before anything went wrong...
braba.
I THINK MUSICALLY I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS WAY SINCE AMY WINEHOUSE, BUT YOUR MUSIC... IT FLOWS DELICIOUSLY, LIKE COTTON, LIKE HONEY DRIPPING OUT FROM THE EARS. AND THE VISUAL'S THE CHERRY ON TOP
Holy fuck!! Best song ever!! 😢❤
ÉSTE ES UN TEMAZOO 🔥 🔥
Such A Beautiful Song ❤
Bruh and I'm here with Llama, Llama red pijamas. 😭😭😭
My friend said he thinks ur a boy or trans his is name Emiliano
Really loving this album
Shit made me ball wtf am I gay
El final se parece mucho al de faerie soireé
Me erizó esta canción desde el primer momento ❤
Kali❤
Kali te amo eres lo mejor 😭💗🫵🏼
1,25 speed, not bad
Esta canción más que algo romántico, significa en mi corazón una canción para alguien que te amó incondicionalmente, como tu padre o abuelo, alguien que lo da todo simplemente por querer que sonrías un día más. Cuando en la letra dice "te entregaré estas bendiciones cuando no estés", me pegó fuerte, ojalá algún día podamos encontrarnos con ese familiar que ya no se encuentra entre nosotros:')
This song got me through a breakup, I love you Kali ❤️🥲🌹
Todo el álbum es arte 💕💗💗
Jewish people be like " I wish you Moses " 😂
hermosaa 🥀🥀
Am a nikka and I fuck with this banger
This song is perfect!!!!
This is art.
I LOVE YOUUU, KALI UCHIS
I’m a guy but this shit is fire💀
Making it my personal fucking mission to like and comment on every Kali song/video from soundcloud and youtube to show my DEEP fucking love and support for her and her growth (besides buying her products or concert tickets) *as long as the system lets me and stops deleting my comments, or maybe im dumb for posting the exact same comment on multiple videos in a short time frame so im just going to change one letter at a time and see if it works. 1a
I love you rose ❤
what a beautiful video. wow
i love you KALI UCHIS you re best! 🥲
Kali te amooo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤I love you☃️🕸️☃️♥️
This is absolutely 💯 fuckin beautiful and over whelping to my heart
Im such a new fan of her music even the Spanish songs i dont understand ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🌹
Wow me encantó este tema, la interpretación con esa voz tan sexy, esa instrumentación y esos coros, te da algo al escucharla, en mi caso me causa placer escucharla, pero veo que a muchos les llegó por una relación.
Makeup artist snapped
Like fresh music to my ears😮
Simple, beautiful art.
such a beautiful, beautiful song
❤❤❤
I love this song so much because of the great message it holds, wishing the people who have wronged you the best rather than holding on the past negativity. Such an inspiring message to live by, honestly this song has encouraged me to be the bigger person and grow from all that negativity. Thank you so much for this masterpiece Kali
i love it 💖
Que melodias hace esta mujer te amo
llama llama red pyjama
“Any love I gave you is forever yours to keep.” It reminds me that I don’t regret any of the good things I did to make sure my person felt loved and cared for.
Essa musica me abraça todos os dias. Obrigada Kali 🥰
ALL HER MUSIC VIDEOS ARE THE DEFINITION OF VISUALS
1:49 Kali nos spoileo el album Orquídeas y ni sabíamos XD
This song has so much potential for a 0.1 version, I want a part 2. It is amazing and our girl is looking too beautifully it’s blushing me.
How is this woman not more known............
Kylie is copying uuuuu
Como consegue fazer músicas tão maravilhosas? Te amo, Kali ❤❤❤
no hay nadie mas talentosa mas que   kali uchis.
Don won so much with having a partner like that. I hope he knows her worth
Stellar  Song.  Peace to The Wiggins Fam  Peace to Kali
Doesn’t it sound like “Jacob and the stone” at the beginning?
it would be amazing if don toliver is featured, with his amazing euphoric vocals it would match to kali’s angelic voice def would b a banger
노래 너무 좋아요😊🌹🥀
American Beauty refrence
Deja vu in the last few seconds because that is EXACTLY what Melanie did for Fairy Soiree's MV.  Faerie*
That's wifey..
Kali Uchis, if you ever read your comments....         You have helped me through the lowest points in my life. Just your voice alone is enough to make me forget about all reality. Sometimes I think you're an angel, because you certainly sound like one. Your beauty is truly something that is soothing to the eyes. At the time I'm writing this, I know your pregnant, and I must say that I fully sincerely hope you have a safe delivery.
💃🏻🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀
Going through a weird situation letting go of someone this helps make it a  beautiful experience and helps me appreciate it rather than being upset just appreciate the experience neither of us are wrong youre just not for me .
💎
I love the concept of wishing roses on someone when you're leaving them because of the awful way they mistreated us. Is like saying "You're going to really regret this, but I hope you can smell the flowers from time to time"
Mv with Cho Gi Seok’s work, amazing!
The aesthetics of this video reminds me of Nick Knight's work
OMG😂❤❤
I love u kali❤

The day she was born, not even her mother knew she would be blessings us with her voice...

Perfection 🌹
Keep smelling. They toxic.
Shout out to American Beauty, the movie they nicked the falling roses scenes from
Whenever I listen to this song it’s my POV of me talking to my dad after not talking to him for almost 3 years when she said “never thought I’d be without you” I felt that I was a daddy’s girl till I hit like 20
this music video is a work of art.
Brillant Art
Divine
THIS SONG HEALED ME
Watching a "TONY BAKER" Instagram post is what brought me here...🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥
She so pretty
Kali, te amo, ya no estoy enamorada de ese hombre y esta canción me ayudó a superarlo y a estár más tranquila, cómo te amo Kali :33
😊
I loved her ever since 2015. Kali Uchis is timeless 😍
why have i only just found her, this womans voice make me feel like even the air around me is soft and gentle enough to fall into, The uk is slacking ive never heard her on our radio st
❤ essa mulher e muito gata to paixonado nela😊
te amo
Llama llama red pajama~😭
Kali teaches us even how to love our enemies, this woman's from another world, jokes aside
romantic & innocent time music
The line, "I wish you roses while you can still smell" is honestly so powerful, because in the end we'll wish the person that hurt us all the best but there will always be a part of us that deeply resents them
/is this what is cnosidered the extension of art film and expression?  I'm glad she's doing so well in her career as a artist and wants to create these magnificent portraits and stories with her work.
I fucking love this song!!
❤
Neta como te amo kali❤❤❤❤
Wow, this is a f*ckin' masterpiece.
ACHO MUITO PARECIDA COM ESÙ...ME DA UM CONFORTO E UMA NOÇÃO DE CONSCIENCIA SOBRE AS MULHERES, APESAR DESTA LUTA DIARIA COM MEU EU HOMEM GAROTO

I dedicated this song to my sister earlier this year. We have been going through it but I still love & wish her nothing but the best. I haven't told her this is our song but my heart knows I think of her every time❤️
I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS SONG I LOVE U KALI
I’m all gánster till this song comes on
Que lindo mensaje deja está canción. Así no sea un para siempre juntos el amor que se entregó no se regresa y hay q desear bendiciones y nuevas oportunidades a esa persona q te hizo feliz en su momento. Excelente canción. Hermoso trabajo de Kali❤.
Too Much 🔥
Que te vaya bien.
Me eriza la piel esta canción, es maravillosa
This sound is soothing my god damn soul
I love this song helped me move on from my ex she broke my heart so bad I didn’t know what love was until I met her
Tell me why I want the llama mama song ❤
Esta Canción me comenzó a gustar me la dedicaron nunca la traduci era el amor de mi vida y ahora es una canción que me encanta y siempre la voy a amar con todo mi corazón Maria Jose López te amo demasiado aunque ya no estemos juntos y siempre quiero lo mejor para ti
Buradaki tek türk olmak ❤
This song came out right when I needed it to. My ex and I have been in a very rough relationship. We dated for two years, and he cheated on me two times. I never forgave him but I still let him stay with me because I hoped he would change. Other than the cheating, he was really abusive & we turned into a long distance relationship after I moved back home. He's currently abroad working & we talk daily. He's super apologetic about the way he cheated on me but the cycle of abuse he constantly puts me in is him getting angry at me for the little things, hanging up on me or telling me to fuck off, and then him calling back or texting me saying that he's sorry. I used to resent him so much for every time he hurt me that I would think to myself that if I wasn't happy then he didn't deserve to be either. I don't know why I was so madly in love with him because maybe it was just me telling myself that I was in love with who he used to be. After a huge argument between me and him, I just stopped loving him all together. I was too attached to break it off officially, but it took so much out of me to do it. I resented him so much because he told me that I treated him like shit and that everything was my fault for him "hurting" (his friends cut him off because of how shitty he was to me). He would suicide bait me, telling me that he hated himself and he self-harmed because he hated how he "treated" me. I hated him but I was scared of him hurting himself. After I broke up with him, I had to cut him off and let go. I was still so attached, but I learned to stop myself from reaching out to him ever again. This song spoke to me in a spiritual level and kinda told me the message that I need peace. I wish him well, because that's just how I am. I hope me and him never cross paths again, but I hope he lives life like how I will live mine.
I love kali such talent. Amazing melody
❤ memory lane lol
this is pure art
Go girl I love you ❤

This song is too good 😫🤞🏼
Had to tell someone I connected with. To leave. I just can not deal with more toxic behavior or mistreatment. I cared deeply. I wish you roses
La mejor canción del álbum sin duda. 🔥🔥🔥♥️

Beauty in so many forms ♥️
Love her gotta beautiful soothing voice 😍
Cópia de Bjork
❤
Just saw her show in Vegas....My God. What a performer!
I love it ❤
I interpreted this as a song about a suitor/lover who ended up not being the one but she wishes him more roses as she is one as well and he fumbled her. Her love for him comes with the gift of new love. However, he will never get over her and luckily for him she hasn’t really gotten over him yet. :)
I keep playing this over and over..
R&B's finest 🔥🔥🔥
she have no nippies
Kali yuga
Selena Q. Would have love this !!
Yes to everything everyone said❤

Beautiful Track✨
I was randomly playing a creative Fortnite map trying to level up and earn XP and heard this song playing. I *instantly* fell in love and *had* to know the title of this song. I’ve been playing it on repeat ever since. 😍😍😍
This is so creative, congrats Kali you are amazing.

Str8 grownfolks music I love this song❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish them all roses. But my love is as deep as the ocean for the beautiful man I am with now.
❤👏🏾🙏🏾💯🌹
I fuck with this song that’s on period
te deseo rosas
For the narcissist that I loved so much, we brought the worst in each other. I will always have deep love and shame for my actions, and how I projected my trauma onto him, it just couldn't be. We were destroying each other.
I am mad because why is this only at 10 million views
She's such a positive person and I love it💘
Need extended version
🌹
No k. Free. Jz.. Time. No. Free
She’s very talented ❤ her voice is so smooth
Here because of llama llama red pajamas. Her voice is soothing and sensual. Regret not discovering her before a couple of months ago. 💯❤😍
0:28  tbh if i got a bee sting i would probabñy need to be sent to the hospital lol because on severely allergic
🧠
by far this is the best song you have ever created, so much love from South Australia, you're an amazing talent
The best beatiful song I've ever heard TBH
Her best one omg
Healing just started 💫🪄
Eu amo você demaizi, comigo é só love love Nayara💓🖤
I got fiemusic
suck a fucking creative visual genius, this is absolutely amazing
She is such an amazing, authentically talented musician. This entire album is everything. Her music is truly beautiful art.
Art she’s so different than all the other people who’s famous. I live for it and I’m here for it
“I’ll make sure to give u these blessings becuz there all I’ve got” is such beautiful optimistic way to look at lost relationships
Just amazing xxx I'm in love with this song and your voice xxx Magic ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gorgeous video, Awesome song, and Phenomenal woman❤❤
nice
the visuals are so trippy I love when it slows down too
Reminds me of the early Weeknd. Love it
Wish u roses ina
love the pejoration
Why she so fine
This song has different meaning to me. I was married for 2 yrs and I was being bad. I was being abused and mistreated and not loved. I had my knee surgery and my partner wasn’t helping me but rather everywhere else in the world. They were unfaithful and it turned into a DV situation. We’re divorced now and I have no 0 regrets
llama llama red pajam- sorry wrong lyrics

I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Great song!
I love this song ! My name is Rose
essa mulher é maravilhosa
So talented. I think she picked up some soul after working with gorillaz.
I love you Kali Uchis you are my inspiration and I love your songs❤️
Exótico este himno , bien cuadro y grifo con este tema que me hace sentir todo y nada al mismo tiempo ⏱️
Even after relationship/ friendship I will Neva wish any hate towards them. I wish u roses and love and healing ❤️
This song and album are helping me heal from a toxic friend group I was in during 2022/2023, I broke them off in June and now I have no friends but I’m better off alone than being with people who don't care about me genuinely as a person. I admit I was pretty toxic too but at least I tried to change and apologized multiple times for it, I wish them luck in the future and I forgive them and forgive myself for not being better and not being there for myself when I needed it the most. God loves you all and I hope whoever is reading this also heals from any painful experience they have had, feel free to vent under my comment if you need to, I don't mind. ✝︎
❤
10M finally omg
Sade vibes!!!! 💎💎💎💎💎

This Song is too much beautiful, my ex doesn't deserve it. I dedicate it to myself and for every broken heart that is suffering now. If it doesn't heal you, at least you'll be listening good music.

Mother of PEARL.
Wow, I just discovered this artist! So glad I came across her.  What an amazingly beautiful break up song.  What other songs would anyone recommend I hear next?  :)
I'm glad i found Kali Uchis
Amazing video, fantastic song and singer ❤
When an artist makes such beautiful music...do they know how the effect it has on so many of us.  This song is about letting go and moving on with no resentment. I think that is love. Thank you Kali❤
This one HEALS ME
I LOVE HERRR 😍🩶

Thank uuu for this, Kali. ❤️
Really sexual-sensual I can def see some influence from Tyler the creator
To me Kali Uchis is Jazz, or has that Classic vintage Vibe and can also adapt into any modern contemporary genre but also make it her own with her voice and vibe. ❤️🌹🌹
Sexual obviously.🏳️‍🌈
I can't stop listening to that song, it brings out my femininity.
llama llama red pajama…..
Wow sounds like Sade so much 😮😮😮
I met so many people who were in my life for a reason. Thank you for the good and the bad.

Wow
Never wanted to lay on a rose so bad 😂🌹☠☠☠ lol
Nice voice
I heard about her a month ago just listen to this song wow 😮
I’m honestly floored. This was one of the best music videos I’ve watched in awhile
Artistic with a  nice voice. It's what the industry needs 2023. Angel from The Bay
woww
Amo esta canción, es hermosa ❤️❤️❤️
esse clipe foi c crtz o mais lindo da carreira dela ate agr
You slay kali uchis bomb song 🎵❤
I'm turning 31 in July. When I was a kid, I only listened 60s and 70s music because the music that came out in the 90s, 2000s, and early 2010s was absolute garbage to me. I adore the direction that modern music has taken. This is absolutely gorgeous and I hope this trend sticks around for a long time. This ethereal masterpiece will stick with me forever.  Oh, and Evanescence sucks.

My ex is back from alternative school, about two months we’ve been apart, I’ve never felt so much peace
The lyrics are absolutely beautiful 🙏🏾
kali te amo mucho (┬┬﹏┬┬)💕💕
I grew up listening to Sade. Cali's vocals, chill vibe, and the instrumentals are slightly reminiscent of Sade. Cali is such an amazing and refreshing artist.
Love you kali ❤😊
This song is soooo good!!! I can’t stop listening ❤❤❤
Gracias x tremenda obra de arte❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
DIOS LA VOY A BAILAR EN MIS 15 HAAA Q EMOCION🤍🤍

She's more beautiful than kim kardashian.
This album literally healed my resentment towards my last ex who broke my heart and used me to his advantage, and also helped me forgive myself for not being there for me during that time of my life. Gracias Kali, te amo siempre desde de Por Vida que me ayudaste a sentirme acompaniada <3
Miguel eu te amo

This is a beautiful song and video. It’s like a love letter with a visual. Amazing
I heard the absolute GEM while playing Fortnite of all things. I'm hella thankful to the creator of that map for putting me on 🙏🏿
Whom amongst you, are here from #Fortnite 🙋🏻‍♀️🫶😅
Que hermoso video ❤
I dedicate this song to the love of my life. We had to part  due to not sharing the same religion. I’ve never met a man as perfect for me as him. I will forever love him, my heart hurts as if a thorn of a rose was stabbed right into it. I wish him roses and roses and roses 🌹 He deserves nothing but the best this world and god has to offer him. I pray god takes care of his beautiful heart the way this man took care of mine while we were together. I will forever love you my sweet darling 💔😢
This is probably the best music video of 2023.
I've been missing my late friend, and was playing Fortnite yesterday when I played this Playwave.😢💔 I wish you roses and I cant wait to come across your energy again, mon frere. ❤
QUE GRANDE CHOGISEOK

Just ended a 3-year relationship with the man I thought I was gonna marry. I am mourning not only our relationship but our goals, our plans to create a family and move abroad together. It has been one of the hardest things my heart has endured but I'm sure that wasn't my place to be any longer. I wish him roses 🌹

There are no words for such an musical excellence. just a masterpiece, right now we doesnt measure the greatness of this production... This is historic.
dedico essa música a mim, a minha família, aos meus amigos que estou longe. traçando minha jornada 🌹💗
Is it just me or the version of this song in Spotify changed from this one to the other one (that has a different video)?
my favorite incarnation of Aphrodite, love u Kali
Is it me or reminds this music of Sade from the 80s?
a masterpiece
S ehan dado cuenta que las rosas pueden un sifnificado de florecer osea el periodo o ya no ser virgen

New..SADE❤
Niiiiiiiiiiiice! Kinda sounds dreampop a la Gang Gang Dance with a pinch of Sade.
She makes pop music for marijuaneros
Meu que obra de arte. Tudo delicadamente pensado, o timbre da voz, a escolha do tema do clipe. Amei.❤❤🇧🇷👏
my ex left me after 12 years and I was completely heartbroken. When I hear this song I always tear up because I have finally gotten to a place that I have forgiven and wish him well. I wish him roses.
Los videos de kali están a otro nivel
kali t amaré hasta la muerte

linddaa
I wanna listen to more music like this. Any recommendations? What would this genre be? I'm new to this type of music
Gente pequeno desabafo dessa música, que se prestar ATENÇÃO é claramente uma música sobre PERDÃO e SUPERAÇÃO Em 2020 eu sai de um relacionamento q achei q seria eterno (hoje vejo q não) mas na época até emagreci de tão mal  q fiquei A Música >>>>>Death to me<<< da gata REALMENTE me fez dar vida ao seguir em frente, vendo que aquele relacionamento tinha morrido, as 2 versão ouço até hoje........ Uma das partes q me marcam são ''Veja, você acha que tem problemas comigo Mas querido, eu nem sequer penso em você'', pq depois que passou nada mais me afetava sobre.  Agora em 2022 eu levei 2 foras (sim as gatas tbm levam foras)  E essa música >>>>>>>I wish roses<<<<<<< Que música maravilhosa, com vocais afinados, clipe delicado de certa forma, com letra mais do que profunda, de algo que partiu mas não desejamos o mal sabe? ''Ooh, nunca pensei que ficaria sem você Te desejo amor, te desejo tudo de bom'' Com flores bonitas, pode vir a picada de abelha (ooh, nunca pensei que ficaria sem você)'  Mas eu te desejo amor, te desejo tudo de bom FLORES são coisas q damos ao conhecer alguém e levamos qdo alguém morre (literalmente)  E poder desejar o bem para quem nos feriu é algo DIVINO. quase impossível e poder seguir em paz então é MARAVILHOSO  Valeu Kali por essas poesias cantadas.
i love the flower kuchis in the video
Her & Quelle Rox are my favorite spanglish singers. 🥰
I WISH YOU ROSES IS SO FUCKING UNDERRATED
Diosaa🤍🤍
Beach house 1.0
Ur biggest fan won’t be at ur show tonight but you’ll feel me in someone’s heart
I love Kali and this song but don’t compare her to other artists release music. As in she is proof that this is how you handle with breakups. Like, previous releases of Kali also show anger towards failed relationships.
This brings me to the days I didn’t exist!
Gracias por tu música y arte, Kali! Felicitaciones desde Brasil ♥
daejm imy :(
Whyyy this is soooo underated🙃🙃🙃

A maior 🇧🇷❤ i love you Kali ❤
belissimo
Her words clicked to me and I finally let go after 6 years ❤
Vamos por los 10 millones ❤
“Just know any love gave you is forever yours to keep” is such a beautiful sentiment. To be able to grief the ending of loving someone but letting it go without any bitterness and resentment is so liberating. You never really lose if you gave love ❤ love is not an act of losing 🌹
I wish you love💋
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i luv u kali 💞
she's ethereal
❤
dismio

Reminds me of Sade

eu te amo kali uchis
Just heard this on the radio yes I love it I’ve never heard this song ❤️❤️🙏🏽
My boyfriend broke up with me after 5 months of dating. Things got really toxic, mean and dramatic for a short period after. I've been crying so much and wondering what went wrong and how we could've fixed it. But after a week of very little communication and sadness, today he sent me this song and all the pain I've been feeling just hit me 10 times harder. I miss all the good times and having him around. I will always have love for him even if he doesn't (or never did).
Kali te amo, el concepto y la letra son tan profundos y perfectos que las palabras se quedan cortas, gracias por crear arte
❤ love it
Zyra’s song
Reminds me of Sade
I wish you roses while you can still smell 🌝🌹
when i'm here I'm someone to honor, when I'm gone I'm someone to mourn.
I teared up so bad the first time I heard this song. My ex and I had a falling out and I couldn’t explain the sadness I felt but also loving myself and him enough to let him go; this song just gets it
Eres una Ángel y un demonio a la vez❤
This is timeless... reminds me when I was a kid in the 1970's watching vatos with their girls slowly pass by in their newly polished low-rider while blasting some oldie...damn ❤❤❤
The visuals- the lyrics-  Kali you absolutely popped off with this whole album!!!!!!
This has mac Miller circles vibes
This song melody is STILL stuck in my head, even after these few months. That just shows how great of a song this is - I find myself randomly singing the chorus melody. Prob my fav song from her ever
She the epitome of a true artist this is pure gold❤ Definitely top tier!
Mi mami 🙏
Someone needs to put this on a loop.This sounds gooood😊
She's so magical mashallah
SHE´S AMAZING BLASTER . . . !
Porqué esta obra de arte tiene tan pocas vistas? Te juro que es de lo mejor que he escuchado en el año, la gente no valora lo realmente bueno.
I have to let my kitty go tomorrow. We are chilling on the porch. This song is so healing for the way that I feel. Thank you ❤
Beautiful❤❤😮
WOW 🌹🌹🌹

❤this song 🎵 it’s on repeat in my phone.
This is the album I've been waiting on from her. That I knew she was capable of. Flight 22 was my fave song on Isolation and its like she made a whole album with music like that. I am madly in love with this record.
gorgeous kali😍😍

"When I'm here I'm someone to honor, when I'm gone I'm someone to mourn"  taking that energy with me for the rest of forever 🥰🥰🥰

I love this song I lost my grandmother and I think of her every time I hear this song ty
Eres arte, Kali.
This song gave me the closure i didnt know i needed.
un show de mujeres, Don Toliver eligió el perfecto te amo Kali🤍.
Amando muito essa música, ouvindo toda hora ❤
Sooo goooddd
Te amo kali <3
this making me cry in class 😭
God I love her music soo much. This song means sooo much to me right now. I just lost my girlfriend of four years two days ago and I just heard this song a week or so ago. All I can think about right now is my now dead love of my life. We had plans to goto see kali Uchis perform when she comes to Detroit in may.  I’ve loved Kali Uchis music ever since I heard her on a radio show called the Progressive Underground on Wayne state public radio 101.9 hosted my Chris Cambeaux when she had dropped her first album and she did an interview with the host and I was hooked ever since. The thought of going now breaks my fucking heart because the love of my life won’t be able to share this with me when I go now, mi corazón y mi amor.
Æ
Hermosa te amoooooo
🌹 ❤
Te amooo
Love her!!! 💗💗💗💗💗
to this day i still cry when i hear this song LMAOO
This video should probably win a music video award. Utterly beautiful, and creates something new from the common rose imagery.
SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG AND ALL THAT KALI TAKES OUT 😻❤️💕💕💕💗💗❤️❤️
🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
I AINT EVEN HAD MY HEART BROKEN AND I STILLL FUCK WITH THIS SONG
This is a literal piece of art. This is poem.
Why do I need a Kali X Raye colab? 'cause it's meant to be, and it will be sooooo fkng good
She is a freaking angel 👼
Sempre perfeita😍🌹🌸💕
Javier... those blessings take with you, use them when you're lost or even when you've find yourself in pure bliss.... my love gave you a step into happiness, and even though my soul aches for you, my heart knows you're happier where you are.... I wish you roses
The director of this video needs a raise
I can feel this song in my soul
Wow thank you Don Tolliver!! Besides beauty this song was enchanting!! Just found about her now
Fire 🔥
This is a piece of art, hypnotizing, beautiful, almost painful, takes me to some places.. I haven't heard something so beautiful in a very long time! Also, the video..... a fucking masterpiece all together!
Que clipe lindo. Me fez lembrar muito o som do isolation. Elegante e maduro
Já é uma das minhas favoritas da Kali
¡Dioses! Te amo mucho Kali Uchis, gracias por existir y hacer música.
"My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina." - Big Lebowski Yeah - this video is shamelessly vagina themed.
Te amo KALI ❤
This is such a beautiful video… the artistic expression and style is amazing. Why can’t we get more videos like this? Her voice , beauty, and vibe is superb 👌🏼💕💕💕😌😌😌💕💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐

I LOVE IT SM AKKZKZKZ
most beautiful clip I've ever seen in my life
I guess working for target has its perks because i stumbled across this song while working at target 😅
Eu escolhi te amar, por isso deixo você ir embora, as oportunidades estão abertas, tudo está dando certo, só tenho gratidão por ter uma família maravilhosa, por ter amigos alinhados no meu caminho, obrigado por tudo, agradeço muito a você ❤ um dia eu sei que estaremos juntos novamente e te mostrarei essa mensagem ❤
This song is so healing
Kali Uchis music is so cool, so sexy, dream like... Dream Pop... She's as cool as Lana Del Rey, Jessy Lanza, Jessie Ware, Corinne Bailey Rae, Alicia Keys, Lianne La Havas, Charli XCX, Caroline Polachek... Intelligent Pop music...
This has a warm, sensual & gauzy feel and gives me brain tingles like classic Sade 🖤🖤
kali’s creativity is perfection
Te amooo kalii
She looks like Sade style
This is the most beautiful MV for a song I’ve ever seen😍😍 I’m completely mesmerized by her beauty and voice!! ❤
3,5 antes do álbum vamos lá kuchis nos conseguimos e assistam a moonlight tbm

@aina abdul ...tru cover this song
This song sends me on a trip every time I hear it
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. I LOOOOOVEE YOUUUU TWO.
WOOO IM LATE
I WISH YOU ROSES
prettiest mv ive ever seen
Accidentally listened to this in 1.25x for the first time and I love it
Holy shit this song is blowing up Kali! I seen it on a juke box at a local bar in a small town. I have a pretty strong feeling this is going to get radio play like telepathia. I also wanted to say congrats on Don’s new release too. It’s cool you both released a new album around the same. You got so many good things going on. But I know you worked hard for all this. You deserve every bit of it. Idk your just such a great artist and I’m happy you share your music with the world.
This song lives rent free in my brain
ILYSM
Kali sooooo good in every language
Una de las pocas canciones que llegan a tranquilizar, siempre la mejor en este género Kali Uchis
“Roses really smell like boo boo”
🦋💖
The fact this shit came out on my birthday makes me feel royal
I recently found out my ex still likes me and ever since then I have had this song playing on repeat. Me and him have been leaving and coming back and leaving again and again and again. This time I told him that we shouldn’t be friends or anything at all. I wish him love. I wish him well. I wish him roses. 🤍
I could’ve sworn this song was at least 5min long, but it was because i listened to it on loop for an hour 😂
Hope it gains 5 million 🎉❤
Doja Cat collab plss
best song to heal to
Bro she badder than Beyonce

Ni siquiera se q dice pero me hace llorar
Reminds me of Sade 💓

COLOMBIANA
Kali nunca decepciona ❤
Gotta love her
Fkin vile
Never heard of you but your music is pretty good... it's giving me early 90s vibes for real
THIS IS SO GOOD 😍😍😍😍
Shes the Next AaLiyah. The GOAT.
Incrível, música muito fodaaa 🇧🇷
Gracias kali uchis por hacer mas llevadera la vida con tu música y ayudarnos a muchos 🙌🏻💪🏼 ufff esta música esta increíble estoy enamorado
I love you kali uchis, this song gave me back my life
This. 🎵🎵🎶🎶👉🏽🥈👉🏽👂🏽👂🏽❣️🔥
This song definitely touched my soul the first time I heard it ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥👽
A real artist, a real musician. I'm a fan of your music.  You are really awesome.  You are great.💫
Kali, realmente me estoy tomando tu música como terapia en este momento, y más aún con esta canción que me hace llorar a mares porque quiero sanar desde ahora y dejar de recaer, quiero sentirme bien conmigo misma.  Escuchar esta canción me hace recordar diferentes cosas, recordar todo el daño guardado y como cai en algo que jure no hacer nunca en mi vida, que es meterme en el mundo de la drogadiccion aunque no llegue a tal punto de hacerlo, ya que solo me dopaba, queria escapar de la realidad en la que vivia y eso empeoro más, quiero que esto sirva de ejemplo para alguien, CONSUMIR DROGAS O CUALQUIER ESTUPEFACIENTE NO TE HARA ESCAPAR DE TU REALIDAD, SOLO TE MATA INTERNAMENTE.  Y lo digo por experiencia propia, al final termine autolesionandome porque vi que nada de eso servia, solo estaba empeorando mi estado emocional y mental, deje de lado esas cosas y ahora tengo personas que me apoyan, esto paso en agosto de 2022.  Desde ese tiempo he estado en constantes caídas y levantandome, pero ahora es incluso peor porque sigo sintiendo mal y por eso quiero avanzar de la mejor manera y vivir sobrellevando mi pasado como una reflexión, dejar de comerme la cabeza con cosas negativas y ya no obsesionarme con mi futuro, ya que quiero vivir en el presente buscando mi propósito de vivir e incluso tener metas y saber que ESTA BIEN NO ESTAR BIEN, puedo caerme pero tambien tengo la capacidad de levantarme de todo esto, después de todo somos nosotros mismos quienes debemos salvarnos porque nuestras personas mas cercanas nos pueden dar apoyo y todo, pero nosotros decidimos si quedarnos estancados o no, y yo he decidido avanzar de la mejor manera posible. Gracias Kali por la música que haces, eres mi lugar seguro y espero volver a escuchar esta canción sin tener que estar triste.
If the colour red was a song. A very relaxing song and I can see why people call it a healing song
I understand
🔥
The lyrics and video are so beautiful 😍😍😍❤️
🌹💕  I have no words. She's the best, forever.
The beginning  reminds me of another song but I can’t put my finger on it
this is one of those songs that doesn’t have a best part. every second of this song is the best part
I can't wait for her album
Obviamente es la canción perfecta para manifestar
amo esta canción
Absolute masterpiece!!!
this video is piece of art
This song is too beautiful it makes me cry
I've loved her since Loner ❤️
AMAZING
🌹🌹🌹🌹
te amoooooooo
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Did she say which album is going to be the English one?
ate.
That sou prettyyyyyy
This was amazing fr
this song is so beautiful and really showcases how even after loving someone, you can let them go with peace & wish them well instead of being filled with anger and resentment.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Me enamoré de esta canción pero al ver el vídeo me casé. Qué visuales tan hermosos, recordé algunos vídeos de Bjork. Esto es arte en su plenitud... Qué orgulloso me siento que sea colombiana. 🌸
Kali is one of the most beautiful and talented artists in my opinion. I feel like this song was influenced by the 1971 song “I wish you love” by Joe Bataan. If it is, I personally love how she can look back at great song hits for inspiration rather than just simply sampling a part of it but rather creating something completely new and unique. She is truly amazing and can’t wait to listen to her music for the rest of my life
@kaliuchis  I WISH YOU ROSES Produced By @joshcrockermusic @dylanpatricewiggins  Official Music Video Directed By @chogiseok  OUT NOW 🤜 Distributed By @usemyideas 🤛

Te agradezco tanto, de verdad que muchas de tus canciones me han ayudado a sanar desde el 2021 que te empecé a escuchar. Era mucho el dolor que me costaba reconocer o dejar ir. Tus canciones han puesto en una melodía bella todo ese sentir.   Acabo de iniciar una nueva etapa de mi vida, ingresé a la Universidad y ahora me siento mejor conmigo, me siento contenta por todo lo que está por venir. Quiero desearle rosas a las personas que me hicieron daño, porque sólo reflejaban su ausencia de amor. Pero sobre todo, me deseo a mí rosas que sé que merezco y que cada día cultivaré en mi interior. Me deseo cosas maravillosas, me deseo fuerza y cariño.
Cuando mas necesita escuchar su voz, ella llega a buen tiempo. She kills me, how great she artistically is!
OBSESSED
Hermosa 😘🇨🇴
Wait this sounds alot like Little Dragon
Algum BR🇧🇷
Everything is pure beauty
Sade vibes ❤❤❤❤❤
caraio entrou na mente d+

I wish you roses baby. Free you till it’s backwards…
One scene was definitely a nod to an “American Beauty” scene
Te amo Kali, muchas gracias por edta canción
Beautiful❤
❤️❤️❤️
This song right now brings me to tears, today I lost my best friend, she had a desease , we knew this was coming.This past days we've been listening to this song and I put another meaning to this song especially when she says Never thought I would be without you I wish you well and I wish you roses. We were gonna plant roses because we love plants :c, but for now I keep this song in my memory forever and I'm gonna plant roses to my beautiful and always kind friend, I wrote this so you my future me ,when you see the comments remember her always and how she was the most amazing and precious creature that this world could've done 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Que música maravilhosa pqp!!
Kali we love you!!!! ❤❤❤ Venus foreverrrr
The visuals are absolutely amazing
a true artist.. a visionnaire!
To the last situationship I have been in :(

hey YouTube I thought this video of Kail U was really alright goodnight YouTube.
Through all these comments. I hope one day that the girl who dedicated me this song.. know I miss and love her everyday 💔😔
I LOVE YOU KALI 💗
KALI 😿💓💓
Es el hechizo cortalazo más lindo que he escuchado 🥲
Beautiful song and visuals,  as a 30 year old and something this is refreshing to see xxx
Her style ISSA a whole latina vibe live it.
good song
i lov u
My ex asked me to listen to this. Girls, can you explain ?
baru denger sekali, lgsung nyantol
Such a diverse artist man r&b is her thing yo
Extremely good
I felt every lyric to this song & sent this to my Ex in tears.📢 I never thought I would be without YOU, I wish you love, I wish you well, I wish you Roses while you keep on studying. Uo you uouu Hi up up up you tri
Oozing sex appeal.
🧎🧎🧎
this song is so beautiful and memorizing. I love Kali!🤩
Idk why but when it says “ can come the bee sting” I hear can Kim kardashian
this song is so good
a melhor do ano
XXX
I REALLY LOVE THIS SONG. I’m a man and I know a song with BLUES AND PEACEFUL ENERGY ❤YOU A DOPE ARTIST. Keep up the good work❤❤❤❤
This song dropped the day of a fucked up breakup for me and it most def sped up the healing process for me, love u Kali
She’s unstoppable ❤
Love you forever Kali 💞
This is perfect woman.Fantastic body.
Imo, this song is about an extremely attractive girl who is flighty. So the message here is to cherish those moments with her because they are rare and special.   In this song, it is almost like she is talking to the male/female who's  into another cute female. Sense she's unwilling to settle down. All she can do is give u a blessing. Wishing more roses like her in ur life to make u happy.
бож наконец впн заработал
que precioso video yo creo uno de los mejores en la historia de la humanidad
Strong shades of Sade... love it!

Uchis supremacy 🧎
I can't stop listening to this song. I feel an euphoria that takes over my whole chest, and I feel as if I'm floating  I admit I don't listen to Kali that often. My wife does love her though, and plays her songs very often in the car, so I listen to some of them here and there, and I must say none have disappointed.
reina nunca decepcionas, te mando muchas rosas desde ecuador
te pedí un tema, no un TEMÓN ❤
when you love Kali, but you're  a bitter scorpio, so you can't relate to the lyrics
👽💖🧚🏼‍♀️
love you kali 😢❤❤
Kali tqm 💘💘

Estoy enamorada de la canción<3
Me encantaaaaa
U never disappoint

This V just makes me wanna watch it Again.
Ended flowers
I felt this❤️
Meu amor é profundo como o oceano! ❤️
Why are the views on this so criminally low, this is first of all an incredible song but this music video??? Are you kidding mE?????
this is so beautiful
Bros Doja cat + The Weekend
Ignotico 😍
When I’m here I’m someone to honor; when I’m gone I’m someone to mourn
QUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNN!!!!!
I've seen Kali three times. I flew from ATL to NYC only to see her at a music festival, then I saw her twice more in ATL. She's coming back! I was SO excited...until I discovered tickets are $200 each. Sure I spent a lot more than that to see her in the past, but look at the economy today. I'm not wasting $400 to see a show when eggs are $8 a dozen. Tone deaf, offensive prices.
I literally can't stop listening to this. It's addicting. Kali is a goddess
Kali eres unica la unica en este estilo aunque seas polifacética
I need a song with her and alina baraz my two favorite female artists ❤️‍🔥⭐️
🌹🌹🌹Mahakali🌹🌹🌹
Je suis content d'avoir trouvé ce morceau au hasard, tellement relaxant . Sa voix me fait voyager !!
She’s Beautiful 😍
3M vamos lá kuchis
This is beautiful and everything I needed
this song came out at the right time currently going through a break up where i have been cheated on i don't hate him but thankful for the life lesson
Been obsessed with this song since it came out, I love how much I feel the instrumental
Los motopapis también apoyando este temazo
Queen. Goddess. Has this as the FIRST song of the year stuck in my head. Love this Sonic Art.     Much Love Kali. 🖤
This songs TOO GOOD
I broke up with him, I wish him well 🥰
Beautiful song 🎵 ❤️
Stunning visuals and mellow music, her style is one of the best
Neaaaa, por favor tenés q sacar Moonlight
Wow los videos de la reina siempre tan alucinantes e innovadores sencillamente la mejor❤️
I know a few of her songs but oddly I had never seen her before til now..beautiful
This song is perfect. I can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
🌹❤️🌹
Kali just give me a chance please
la mitad de las vistas de este video son mías

Namjoon,,💙
Her lyricism reminds me of Mariah Carey’s songwriting
I  LOVE OU SO MUCH KALI🌹🌜
Another example of the transformative power of music. This song quite literally soothes the soul, Kali is a gem! 🌹 Love this video as well.
Old school coming with that Retro Psychedelic Funk! Love her! ❤️

I'm here because of Namjoon of BTS 💜
Gracias Nam...
LAS MOTOMAMIS APOYANDO ESTE TREMENDO TEMAZO🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a vibe
El rey recomendado  majestuosas canciones.🐕💗
Thank you Namjoon for your recommandation! This is a direct reference to love close to heaven and how to fall gracefully on a bed of roses. Honestly, it gave me heart palpitations! 💜
What vibe
Grandiose
What perfection
The sheer level up is unbelievable. I never thoughts she could top Por Vida because her stuff in between that and this was mixed at best. This is just mind blowing. I feel i should be paying just to watch and listen every time. Makes it rewarding to follow her music. This is A plus.
RM sent me here. Lovely sound 😍
RM ¿?¿?
Kali Uchis: do you have some unresolved feelings?! Us: 👀 Kali: I got you girl...she takes the meaning of I  wish you well but I'm out to another level. She is sooo talented and so underated! She's ART!
Kali making sure winter warm up faster this year, she always delivers!!
me encantan las canciones de kali para estudiar !!son relajadas, me ayudan a concentrarme , la amo  😍😍😍😍😍😍
visuals always gewd
🌹👑
the endddd omg goshhhhh
i wish every guy i’ve ever liked in the past roses, even though they gave me thorns…
Okay so this and Chloe’s “pray away” is giving me the encouragement I need to move forward without hurt/resentment and wish well to those who have done wrong by me 😌
Madre
dios mio
haces arte reina
the lyrics are giving green flags
vc maceta demais

I swear I come back to this masterpiece every single day

Beautiful song 🌹
3:00 slay queen
i am still obsessed  with this song
I'm a big fan of Cho Gi Seok, I hope their team make more music videos
te amoooooooooo
Essa mulher erra? Um som melhor que o outro
the first 8 seconds of this song reminds me of another song that I don't know the name of. someone help
😭 Bro I love Colombians so much. ❤️‍🔥
Dude I found this four or five days ago, and I thought it sounded really nice, so I shared it with someone I've been feeling a certain way about and the first person that came to mind, and now... now I think I'm gonna be really happy listening to this song for 𝙮𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙨.
You deserve more recognition Kali!!!!!
I'm riding in an Uber on my way to work and was playing this song. I'm like "oh this sounds nice." I downloaded to Apple music and now I'm hooked!
At this point, Kali is boring me. This song sounds the same as her other songs.
these visuals are insane
me encantó
This song ❤
Mommy Uchis devoro again.
THIS is how you do sexy, artsy, and edgy. Take note other artists (more recently Sam Smith). You can be tasteful while being all those things mentioned above.
KALI UCHIS TE AMO
Am I the only one crying?
Te deseo rosas. Rosas, Rosas, Rosas 🌹
Go Kali!❤
ansioso pra próxima era da mamãe latina✨
I like it
Hora de llorar

Kali Uchis your are a legend
i absolutely love the visuals! they’re like a breath of fresh air 🌹
She makes me feel like she’s absorbing all the sadness and she’s transforming my pain into a song and the song is apologizing to my heart and only my heart can hear. While my mind is in heaven remembering all the good times and with Every sound she sings I feel like I can close my eyes and feel warm , I feel understood man kali I love you gracias por todo el arte Que produces.🌹
Great stuff
❤❤❤❤love it 🌹
Is it weird I feel like the lyrics of this song read like a Stevie Nicks song in the best way possible? Honestly wouldn’t mind a Fleetwood Mac style cover, though I’d still vastly prefer the original 😊
I can’t explain it but the first like 10 seconds of this video felt like middle school 😅
High fly on this one
Goosebumps.
my dream is to sleep on a flower 🌹
HERMOSA REINA
deserves more views
✨

los conceptos de Kali nunca me decepcionan. 💗
ES QUE KALI HACE MAGIA CON SUS CANCIONES!!!!!!!!!!
rage and anger is necessary ... healing and moving on is ncessary. this is why i love kali. i feel like when sza dropped it helped me vocalize and understand the anger i felt and betrayal. and kali's music is healing me and helping me move on and wish those in my past well.
Everybody know what is now.  IT useless now boring.
Shallow, its much deeper snd lyric sucks
Why does my heart hurt so much  I could drawn in my emotions
Kinga dms
A ft with The Weeknd please!!!!
the album looks promising, cannot wait for it especially for the Spanish verses to sing along.
QUEEN EATS EVERYTIME !! 💛

So beautiful
Kali Uchis defining the difference between a singer and  an artist. Just stunning - only Alina Baraz & perhaps Jhene Aiko come close in terms of vibe and aesthetic ❤
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
What a peaceful song ♥
beautiful record man. Kali doesn't miss..
Wow just wow 😍
$Asiazzz i lost my job and need insurance to drive my car snd get a different one

This could send me to a different realm
I'm crying i love her
OMG, This give's me weekend's vibe's WOWOWOWO
The best lyrical verse of this song besides "I wish you Roses" is the ending lyric "You Know you can't do that". An elegant farewell to past trials and tribulations and a righteous uplifting song.....curious to know if she wrote this song with someone in mind...
Grabe ka na sassa girl
my favorite song rn omg
i wish them hell but thid shit go hard 🔥🔥🔥💯
I wish music videos were more common. Love this
SHE’S TAKING IT!!! 🌹

KEEP GLOWING UP QUEEN
De mi vida me dolerá borrarlo pero llevo rato queriendo olvidarlo
❤️❤️😍😍😍
I hope I don’t see it on TikTok pls.
absolutely divine ✨🌹
No fights, no toxicity, no hard feelings... we just grew apart. I wish you roses
At this rate, I am just going to buy/listen to her music while trying hard not to look at any of her covers or music videos. Kali is an immensely talented R&B and pop songwriter/singer, and her past two albums are a testament to that claim, but all the in-your-face-full-frontal-nudity is just distracting and something I have come to expect from her since Telepatia. Regardless of gender, this level of "body art" is just too much and unnecessary. Sensuality and sex appeal does not always have to come in the form of risque nudity - just look at Sade! The makeup is gorgeous here, the melody is languorous yet sensual, the lyrics are heart-wrenching and the avant-garde rose costume with the petal headdress is inventive - I wish she had kept things at that. But if this is the kind of attention she enjoys, then to each his/her own.
the visuals are out of this world!!! this video deserves all the awards possible
this song is so beautiful.
I wish you roses while you can still smell them 🌹
A GODDESS
A masterpiece
Love the American Beauty reference!
Love the outro lyrics that portay the emotional complexity of the song. I can’t overstate how much I relate to it.
My love is deep as the ocean don’t drown on me 💐🥹
Amo as receitas  de vcs vcs são 10..🤩
t amo muñeca la voz qué te cargas me hace llegar hasta lo caliente mío que siento al escucharte , perfecta , única , astral con la voz delicada y silenciosa qué transmites dentro de nosotros tus sumisos .🎧💖
Pretty sure SZA has a song identical to this but SZA got there first. Also chamber of reflection by Mac Demarco. Nice attempt KALI but it’s been done before.
I now want to go to the beach just so I can listen to this while watching the sunset and chugging a cold beer. Maybe have it on repeat as, tipsy, I doze off on a hummock. And I don't even drink anymore.
The loss of someone you really love can lead to devastating consequences. Healing for you all. ❤‍🩹🌹
eres una DIOSA
can't believe the mother invented flowers......
WOW
im so fucking proud of you kali<3
😴
a voz do anjo sussurrou no meu ouvido
Never clicked like so fast ♥️
I first heard this song at the gym and I began to tear up.  My most recent relationship ended on good terms and I miss him, even now 8 months later.   No matter what the future holds, if he's meant to be mine or not, I wish him roses....
Gorgeous😘
so beautifull omg crying…

Crying my eyes out
We wait for the álbum kali <33
NUNCA FALLA
Such a good song! Absolutely one of my favorites so far! Not to mention the video is hella cool! But I'm actually surprised that I think this is the only song I've heard of hers that is not bilingual! Even though I don't speak Spanish I am actually trying to learn but I just love how she can seamlessly go between writing in both Languages! Keep it up Kali! Love your Music!!!
Kali your pen is unmatched. I wish you roses ❤😘
💖💖💖
i love this
SHE ATE, mis ojos quedaron bendecidos 🛐
wow.  no hay más nada que decir!
Bi lingual musical genius👏🔥
This is golden 😍
Diabbl I loveeeeeee😍

Wow wow wow damn just love the aesthetic of all the songs she makes sooo vintage and such pretty dreamy vibe I really don’t understand why her songs are underrated man people should understand that she is going to be a legend soon 😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥
Great job on the video Kali!
She is very beautiful, but the lips with water affects make it look more like if she had harpies.  Other than that, I was good.
With these visuals, I think she wants to copy Björk's Utopia.
Es que toda ella es increíble
Lovely, mesmerizing
💯💯💯
isso tá MUITO ESPETACULAR, HÁ DIAS OUVINDO SEM PARAR AAAAAAAAA
Kali merece mais reconhecimento!!!
angelic
Finally a song where she's back to her signature laidback/dreamy rnb sound? Oh she's taking it

Your Video is Top-Shelf honestly especially the motion through the thorny stem right up to the opening flower... that is craft!! love the lyrics and the Vocals you just made my evening.. thank you Kali!!
BELLLIZZZIMMMAAA ....... I WISH YOU...  THE SMOOOOTHEST PEDALS  ........ NO THORNS......   CHICOSTLE
❤️🌹
Random alt lyrics I came up with while sad and high:  I am so mad at you,  at the way you treated me.... But I wish you roses and everything...  I hate how you made me feel,  How you took advantage of my heart... I don't regret loving you, I did it honestly.   I don't and I still do too, It's hard to explain clearly,  I love you and hate what you did, to me,  The love I gave you is yours to keep... I want what we had but know that isn't me, or you.  So sit and think about this moment, What could have been if had you been true.
Catchy. I love the dreamy sound of this tune. Kali has great songs and music videos.
Perfect 😭

never thought kalis would be the person to hear channelling her inner sade but this is divine
i really love how she's been going back and forth dipping between her latin and american influences, and because of that here the rose pedal scene from "american beauty" is just that.... american beauty.
Sheee miss Kali loved loved the video so beautiful!!! and this song and video wow!!!

CO
Espectacular como siempre, te amo
Estoy adicto a esta cancion. ADICTO
She really just said “how can I show off my new implants?” Let’s write a sentence to a beat that sounds stolen from Alina Baraz and make a music video! Kali used to have so much substance coincidentally before she started getting things “added” 😒
Don mommy🌹
Perfeita
When a song says it all...🥲🌹🌹🌹👑
She back with another one 🥺🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
kala ko si sasa

It’s my first time here. And this song… and the video itself.. I LOVE IT !  Roses are literally my favorite flower. This along with it is just so amazing.  I definitely wish you well, Kali! <333
Call me Uchi mama bc I’m her faaaannnnnn

I think she's the LATINA BJÖRK
Que buena canción ❤
I feel like this is a song about wishing someone love because the roses are the flower of love.
Another song I’ll be listening to 24/7
This is the kind of positivity we need after a breakup
✨
a capital a ARTIST
can't wait for the album, this really is her best music video yet
ILOVEYOUSOMUCHHHH KALIIIII
this song & visuals were made to be eulogized. thank god I didn't ignore it when it popped up as a yt's recommendation. I never got into her music like that but the melodies, lyrics and PRODUCTION on this track are so "kali uchis". I might have listened to 10 songs by her and I still get to recognize  her sound. it has such a silky texture, faded and well mixed instrumentation, so vintage, so great, looking forward to the next album.
😍
this video is a work of art kali 🥹❤️‍🔥🌹
Finally, i love it so much! I can't stop listen to it.
Yass Kali this will be on repeat believe that!! Side note: This is what I was hoping SZA’s album was going to be. Not that I don’t like some of the songs, but we supposed to be in a better place ( especially since the last album) and I can’t be in love with my fiancés blasting “Blind” or “Kill Bill”!
I have the Holy Grail. My medical care is complete. MBF.💕
A rose is a headless person ? You wish me medical cases ? Ok, I'm pleased to do the medical work. MBF.💕
💗💗💗
I LOVE YOU KALI THIS IS BOMB.
wow :o Kali this was really stunning. so gorgeous and this song is dope aff <3
I'm enchanted seriously. This mv have some of the most striking visuals of the year imo

Felt surreal watching this
Producer: How many roses do you want in the music video?   Kali Uchis: Yes
Hermosa rosa kali hermoso video
Todo lo que ella hace es mágico, pero este audiovisual es de otro nivel.   Ella merece más vistas. 🫶🏽🔥
mami escribio una cancion que es un mantra para soltar lo que te duele
Well… I was in the most toxic relationship some months ago. In the beginning, it was so happy and shiny, and suddenly everything changed when I realized I was being cheated. I was so sad and anxious, but I decided to undergo physiological therapy. It was a beautiful process because I was able to come back to me, to let go, to thank for all the happy things, and to wish well to someone who, at some point, was so meaningful for me. And listening to this, I realized how much I have advanced in mental health and self-love. Such an act of love wishing roses to an ex... ❤️
OMGGG ESTAS INCREIBLES VISUALES Q NOS REGALO ESTA REINAA
the song is beautiful as always kali, also huuuuge props to the whole team in charge of the video production, it was stunning from start to end !
This is the first song I’ve ever listened from her and I’m obsessed lol

te amo Kali por ti respiro
I love Kali's Hispanic version, but I must admit I missed her anglophone version so much! I feel like it's a completely different persona and style. Love how she sometimes switches and blends both of them too. An icon 🌹🖤

kaliiii diosa es mi nuevo himno, te amo🌻💗🌈

I love you so much jasmine words do not describe it actually it’s the air I breath the thought of you warms my chest. 🖤🖤
This is so healing honestly. When I feel upset about the people who hurt me and are gone and sad because I miss the good times and then I get mad at then bc why'd they have to do that. And deep down I do wish them roses but sometimes the sadness/anger gets to me. I love this song it is perfect. Thank you kali uchis <3

Kali Uchis não se contenta apenas em cantar bem... Ela ainda cria uma estética tão única, tão bela e astral com esse clipe musical divino, elevando o nível de sua música à outro patamar. Simplesmente impecável! 🌸
DEWDDDDD her voice makes me feel so fkn safe
Cho Gi-Seok e Kali Uchis juntos... Meldels, que sonho perfeito. ❤️
I don’t listen to her often, but this is one of the coolest videos I have seen for a music video in a long time
kali, you are sexy in the beginning parts , um, i know a song by the Book of Love called i touch roses, about rubbing a girl's um rose? that's what i'd like to do, but at the beginning i think you airbrushed yours out, so i don't where to stick my finger
💛💛💙❤co
It’s like top tier perfume commercial. ❤️
I knew hearing "I Know What I Want" all those years ago Kali would grow into a imaginative and beautiful artist. I want her to lean into this ephemeral, dreamy sound that suits her voice so well.
this album will be so perfect
Qué pedo, qué pedo con lo fantástico que es el video es un sueño de hadas hermoso precioso te amo Kali you served and you eat chica
Loving the elemental energy

Anyone else here because of Cho Gi-Seok? <3
OMG! 🌹
A work of Art. Thank you for making a melody for us to relate to when we think about the loves that we've lost and given roses to.
Although I'm Indian..I like her Spanish songs more..Sin miedo was such a good album🍷
Esooo Kaliiii!!!!😍😍😍 de lo mejor del ultimo tiempo!! Con el sentido del arte intacto ❤️
it only remains to add a couple of Jean Paul Gaultier dresses in this clip and it will be 100% done..🤣😉👍👍👍
Kali serviu muito nesse clipe ,o audivisual disso está impecável, merecia bem mais reconhecimento. Minha parte favorita foi o final quando ela dorme dentro da flor.
Or generation had Sade, your generation has Kali......enjoy her.
Love her creativity!!👏👏
te amo

📯⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺

Me Encanto!
Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died for our sins and God the Father raised Him from the dead on the 3rd day. He loves us more than anyone. He created us and loves us. His blood was shed for us for forgiveness of sins. Call upon His name! Heaven and Hell are real places. The Kingdom of God is at hand. Only Jesus Christ can save our souls.  “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” Acts 2:38-39 KJV   “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Matthew 4:17 KJV   “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” John 14:6 KJV   “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 KJV   “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” Matthew 6:14-15 KJV  “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” Luke 11:9-13 KJV  “And he spake this parable unto them, saying, What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.” Luke 15:3-7 KJV  “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.” Hebrew 9:27-28 KJV   “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.” John 6:35-40 KJV   “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ ” And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” John 1:1-18 NKJV   “that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed by hanging on a tree. Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly, not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead. To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission[b] of sins.” Acts 10:37-43 NKJV    “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.” Matthew 10:28-31 KJV    “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.” Matthew 10:32-33 KJV   “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Romans 10:9-13 KJV   “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” John 3:5-6 KJV  “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.” Colossians 1:13-20 KJV   “Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”  2 Philippians 2:4-11 KJV

(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Pero que video tab bonito, WOW!

Kali Uchis is the definition of an Artist to me. So happy seeing her in her element 🙏🏼🦋
She makes the best videos period
...Logró el equilibrio perfecto entre sensualidad y arte... Un regalo para la vista y los oídos.
The director for this beautiful mv was cho giseok! please look at his other works he is very talented photographer and artist
The lyrics are so bittersweet and the contrast to the music video’s soft glamour is amazing
Accidentally first listened to this song in +1.5 speed and it’s a diff vibe from the og speed but it still slaps just as hard ✨

Lyrics  [Chorus]  Ooh, never thought I would be without  you I wish you love, I wish you well I wish you roses while you can still  smell 'em With pretty flowers can come the bee  sting (Ooh, never thought would be  without you)  But I wish you love. wish you well I wish you roses while you can still smell  'em (Ooh)  [Verse]  I was a rose in a garden of weeds My petals are soft and silky as my  sheets  So, do not be afraid to get pricked by  the thorns While I'm here. I'm someone to honor  When I'm gone. I'm someone to mourn  But if you and my heart should  someday drift apart  I'll make sure to give you these blessings because they're all I've got My love's deep as the ocean, don't you  drown on me  Just know, any love I gave you's forever  yours to keep  [Refrain]  Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses  I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses  I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses  [Chorus]  Ooh, never thought I would be without  you  I wish you love, I wish you well  I wish you roses while you can still  smell 'em  With pretty flowers can come the bee sting (Ooh, never thought would be without you)  But I wish you love, I wish you well I wish you roses while you can still smell em (Ooh)  [Refrain]  Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses (I wish you  roses)  I wish you roses (I wish you roses), yeah, roses, roses  Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses  [Outro]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh  You're gonna want me back You're gonna want me bad  You're gonna-  You know we can't do that You know we can't do that You know we

Incredible
ב״ה You are NOT THE ROSE. Fall back, and stop your blasphemy with your video, or you can get your one way eviction ticket.   You are NOT The Rose.  In your wet and wildest dreams.  You women need to stop stealing another ONES soul truth and lying, attempting to claim it as your own. You honor YOUR truth of who you are as a soul, you don’t get to steal from others.  Especially when it comes to disrespecting GOD.   You will not get away with it. You’re a human womban. You are NOT: THE ROSE.
Don Toliver's one lucky guy.
Luv u kaliiii
Incredible on so many levels. I already know Ima have this song on repeat for months🌹🌹🌹
You are NOT THE ROSE. There is only ONE SOUL on this Earth who is “The Rose.” This woman is an imposter.  you are  NOT The Rose. You ARE NOT.   This video is blasphemous at best.  You honor your truth of who you are as a soul, and you and the other women don’t get to steal from ONE WOMANS SOUL, what is HERS!!   Identity theft is ILLEGAL.  As well as immoral. Fall back.
The visuals are beautiful omg
This is so perfect!!! STREAM ART !! STREAM KALI UCHIS !! <
She is so legendary 🌹🌹😍

I need this damn album to come out already
Kali is literally the only artist I crush on lol. She brings such a beautiful and glamorous enchantment to heartbreak and I live for all she does. The imagery here too, I love it so much it reminds me of Björk's.

she’s the real queen💋🌹
Bonito video, visualmente sencillo pero no por eso barato o vulgar. La batería y el bajo bien sólidos, teclado y por ahí uno que otro riff mezclado sobriamente sin dejar huecos. Con poca producción y sin maldito autotuuune. Particularmente no me agradan este tipo de cantantes, pero ese sencillo de telepatia me atrapó y este no es la excepción. Espero mayor difusión de esta propuesta, es calidad.
Lyrics are bland, song is very basic and the visuals are just weird. Worst song she’s ever released.
KALI REINOTAA TE AMOO K MELODIAA POR DIOOOSS
so happy we got this early in the year 💓💓
Trashy video and trashy song. What a disappointment…. Kali be doing shitty music lately… she definitely doesn’t have that grip she had on me once. All the hype for nothing tbh

she always slays in every genre she decides to work with, but R&B definitely is her sound
The soft femininity. I love her so much, like she really just went back into the rose and it is just the incarnation of women. The story of the divines and the balance she has within that. Let’s return to the womb, the blossom, our roses. Delicate ❤
Loves from Brazil 🇧🇷🤍🤍🤍

Letra traducida al español:  [Estribillo] Ooh, nunca pensé que estaría sin ti Te deseo amor, te deseo lo mejor Te deseo rosas mientras aún puedas olerlas Con flores bonitas, pueden venir la picadura de abeja (Ooh, nunca pensé que estaría sin ti) Pero te deseo amor, te deseo lo mejor Te deseo rosas mientras aún puedas olerlas (Ooh)  [Verso 1] Yo era una rosa en el jardín de malas hierbas Mis pétalos son suaves y sedosos como mis sábanas Así que no tengas miedo de pincharte con mis espinas Mientras estoy aquí soy alguien a quien honrar Cuando me haya ido soy alguien a quien llorar  [Verso 2] Pero si tú y mi corazón Deben separarse algún día Me aseguraré de dar mi bendición Porque son todo lo que tengo Mi amor es tan profundo como el océano No te ahogues en mí Solo debes saber que cualquier amor que te di Es tuyo para siempre  [Pre-Estribillo] Ooh, te deseo rosas y rosas y rosas y rosas y rosas Te deseo rosas, sí, rosas, rosas Ooh, te deseo rosas y rosas y rosas y rosas Te deseo rosas, sí, rosas, rosas  [Estribillo] Ooh, nunca pensé que estaría sin ti Te deseo amor, te deseo lo mejor Te deseo rosas mientras aún puedas olerlas Con flores bonitas, pueden venir la picadura de abeja (Ooh, nunca pensé que estaría sin ti) Pero te deseo amor, te deseo lo mejor Te deseo rosas mientras aún puedas olerlas (Ooh)  [Post-Estribillo] Ooh, te deseo rosas y rosas y rosas y rosas y rosas (Te deseo rosas) Te deseo rosas (Te deseo rosas), sí, rosas, rosas Ooh, te deseo rosas y rosas y rosas y rosas Te deseo rosas, sí, rosas, rosas  [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh Me querrás de vuelta Me querrás demasiado Me querrás– Sabes que no podemos hacer eso Sabes que no puedes hacer eso Sabes que–

Caralho 🔥 porra vou falar acompanho Kali desde o feat com o fodastico TYLER The Creator, desde lá acompanhei o lançamento de POR VIDA, e me deleitei com ISOLATION sentir neste álbum uma personalidade única, um disco repleto de musicalidade indo de rnb,  passando por bossa nova, mpb, e flertando com dancehall e indie. Depois ela lançou o seu segundo álbum em espanhol que particularmente não me agradou tanto quanto isolation. Mas ouvindo e vendo este clipe parece que vem o ISOLATION PT2 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 to ansioso finally my kali comeback 😊🎉 me pareceu que ela voltou às suas origens 👏🏾🙏🏾💝
te amo!!
her voice is so angelic <3
Can’t wait for the album
Gracias por el arte que nos regalaste D I O S A 😭❤️🌹🌹
