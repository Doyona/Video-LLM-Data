🚨Football is back! Get your questions in for the next video👇
2:50 little did he know👀
This is amazing!
I’m I the only who just found out today that Jesse signed for Hashtag
#UpTheTags let’s go!!!
Hashtag need youth teams aswell! 😄
I’d love to come down and watch you guys but I can’t get down😢
Is there no hashtag academy this year? :(
I miss the days when Theo Baker was bangin' in goals for # United
Where is izu?
Torcida brasileira aqui por voces🇧🇷
Don’t for get to hashtag it⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
New left back looks good, what a player Newby is, number 9 winger in 2nd half looked exciting as well. Very good
Great to see the boys back but where’s captain jack Harrison, Luke Wilson, and Ryan Adams?
Hastag to the prem
Brougham looks ready for the new season
Need Spencer on commentary not enough energy.
damn your commentators are bias.
You should start a junior team
Jesse will probably get most assists
I was really impressed with the new Lb he looks very promising
Where’s Adams brothers
Where is Sam Byles?
Great to see them back at the wins
I was wondering what Tim is Eating/Drinking after the game could someone help me with that?
Are you not streaming on twitch
Hi finally back
All george smith does his throw his arms in the air at other players every time they miss opportunity, how about encourage 🤔 might be an idea, quality again though lads keep it up taggggggsssss ######
What league are they in?
Who misses the ogs dan brown and Ryan Adams partnership
Let’s be honest, they are way too harsh on Osude. Harry honesty was the problem in the first half, poor performance
Where is Samraj??
JUST SUB
2 half full backs looking clean 🤩
Nobody is mentioning him but the new guy Toby is ELECTRIC
Mon tags from Scotland ##
Hi Hastag, can you please update the followers on the INs and OUTs of the team?
Sick channel!! Don't know how we didn't find it sooner.. keep killing it ⚽️⚽️
What happened to Gil
hii
Will the women's side have videos for their games like the first team do?
##########
Where’s ryan adams?
Could you Guys give an Update on the squad ?
Good luck next week against st Albans gonna be a tough game
Can you guys update the squad list on the website?
Great to see you guys back but I have no idea how you enjoy playing on this artificial surface!
imho jacko is the best player co-commentator (so excluding Seb). very excited to see JWL back! and finally, would be shocked if Tomo stays at CB given his goal-scoring prowess. i lied, 1 more bit: Cain take a bow m8
whose left hashtag
Finally
When is the next game
Hey how do I see the table for the ESL thanks :)
Jesse looks like Marcus reus
Missed you
Os cara fica forçando zueira .
Leave josh alone, he can’t help but be a meme 😂😭
To think this is the team that is qualifying in the preliminary rounds of the FA cup is insane.I hope you it to the finals Hashtag.idk if u will see this but I hope u do
Hashtag United vs Jersey Bulls please would be a great game
K
In terms of new lads, Hewitt, Toby, seyhan and right back looking good
So glad this series is back as well as football being back in general
Pov: you haven't seen a hashtag video since the first season and you have no idea who most of these people are
I wanan see samrajjj 😁
If anything JWL is too good that its not fair! Keep him close tags or a bigger team could come knocking. Next Scotty P?
Nice way to introduce yourself to the fans by thieving an absolute shoe in off the golden boot 😂
I've missed watching Joshua Osude play so much 😭😂
Is Izu still there
Are you going to make a video of who’s left and who’s come in I hope you are because it would be nice to know
Jacko is a legend of a man
Get Hashtag to 500k
Can't wait to see the ladies banging in goals
yes lads is wembley next
GG boys. Glad to see you back. Stay healthy and safe. Gonna be great season. 👍
So who didn’t return back to the team?
The team is looking great! I know it's pre season but the movement and passes in the second half especially were next level. #️⃣🏆⬆️ We are going up.
Where is Anderson?
This has made my sunday, love being back boys!
Ohalem the trialist at rb did very well deserves a spot
Thanks for the assist George 👀😂
how’s all this working with COVID going on, was everyone tested or what’s the procedures for non league football?
Always believe in jesse..🔥🔥🔥
Im wayyyy to used to spencer being da commentator 🤣
holaa
Nice to see some gameplay at last, looking ok for the first knock about.
Can you do a hashtag academy for 11 and below in Birmingham
Albie fernandes
wheres samraj gill?
Toby looks like Justin kluivert
When you watch how Tom Williams kick the ball, you just know that he is coming from higher football leagues. Even though he is better as left back, he can play anywhere in my opinion. He should play until 50.
I’ll assume Ryan Adams will be no where near the first team now then?
Jesé is a baller
Wow lockdown has killed smudgers hairline
5:18 No way have you signed Ghetts younger brother !!!!!!!👀
JEEEEESSSSSSSSEEEEEE IISSSSSSSSSSS BAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKK
Could Hashtag 'compete' with an MLS side? Sadly as an American i think it would be a relatively close game. Like if you agree!
Any plans for a new kit this year?
Yes! Welcome back,JWL!
Where is Luke Wilson?
Josh Osude has improved. You can tell by the fact he is has a wider range of options to beat his man out wide rather than just kicking around the keeper and relying on his pace. I think harry honesty needs to be more confident on his right foot because he’s had many chances in his right but takes a sec to shift it onto his left giving the defender a chance to get back in time to stop him or put him off.
3:22 Alphonse Davies in the background 😂
Is Sam Byles still at the club?
Who left?
Toby seems very good
Missed this so much! Up the tags!
Where is Ryan Adams
Are you getting new kits for this season?
I'm really liking the LB that played 2nd half.
Toby looks really good. Josh needs to work on his final ball or else he’ll be glued on the bench!
Singe the f2 boys for the wings
first half looked extremely shakey! Toby and Jessie look brilliant first game back, more to come for sure!
AHHHH IT’S GOOD TO BE BACK!! 🔥🔥
It'll be great in 4 or 5 years when Hashtag have a board member part owner slash player in Azpilcueta .. he might just be a little better than Willo .. no disrespect Tom 🤣
Izu still there?
2nd left back looks like a real good player
Who has left the club ?
All we need is Harry back
Yes sir Jessie is back
Where’s the outro music?😢
Jesse is just insane at football!
Lol @ commentary butchering the trial isn’t name
Jesse Waller-Lassen>Jesse Lingard
What games will u be showing this year - what teams?
Spencer and seb back on commentary please
Is Tobi Justin kluivert’s long lost twin
Ahhh how I've missed Sunday league videos
Let’s go 🔥
will Spenny be back on commentary once the season gets going?
Great to see Hashtag back, great to see JWL back! New LB looks quality.
THIS is the official start of normalization of life for me. Hashtag games back on.
The new guys are insane!
YEEEAAAAAHHHH!!!! hashtag is back
Please do everybody a favour and let Harry honestly go ffs he’s shocking at this level
"tomtom at centre half, navigation on point" 😂😂
JWL is actually such a player man
neil richmond is just your essex lewandowski mans even look like him
Will Charlton sign Conor Washington and Alex Gilbey
Great video. Well done to the editors. Second Half FC did the job well. New signings and trailists look quality. JWL! My #Bruno. Disappointed no fans in the stands, imagine celebrating these goals and skills. But we will be back ASAP when it safe to do.
Can you do a transfer special?Speak about new players where they came from and players that left the club
Has anyone tried to start any kind of Hashtag United international fan club?
Jacko: Should have Layed off the Belgian chocolates 😂😂😂
I haven’t watched hashtag united in months. Did they get promoted?
Toby is quality
Who are you going to be focus on next season
So happy this is back!
Jesse!!! He’s a true baller
Don’t forget to #️⃣ it!
Where is the magician Gill?
Tobes was fire!
Loved the game great to see Jessie and Jacko back playing think the Frentford keeper needs a few extra days training he had a mare on 2 goals
Just wondering where did Jwl go last season and glad to see the tags playing football again #UpTheTags
Osude has no product
This is what dreams are made of💪
When did we sign Martin braithwaite 3:57
How is it being back is it hard?
jack martin will play at least 3 tiers up in his career only like 18 rn playing men’s non league putting in performances
Where’s Ryan Adams
It’s back boys
Richmond is not good enough his time is up
Good luck coming to New Mexico lol
They got such a deep roster right now
That frenford LB needs to get signed nowwww
Is this an actual club or like Sunday league
Frentfords left back in the lead up to the goal was pure quality, lampard would proud of that pass
I can smell that frenford left back from here
Just an idea but it would be interesting to do a hashtag fifa tournament as they were all arguing about who is the best?
So glad you are back playing. Great job keeping us informed during the unexpected offseason. Can’t wait for when you can compete in league play. Keep Up The Great Work, Stay Safe and Lets Go HTU
Who think Jesse should be playing in EPL?
Watching that left back is like watching prime Ashley Cole
The pressure from that frenford left back is incredible
Toby is easily gonna be one of the best players in the league
Frenford left back got it all
JWL is the best footballer to ever put on a Hashtag shirt! Absolute Baller
welcome back boys
JWL!!!! The 🐐!  Also that new winger Toby looks like he’s gonna tear it up! Hewitt the left back looked class as well! Keen for another big year for the tags! Don’t forget to #it!!! ✌️🔥 ⚽️
Having Jesse back is huuuuuge!  Up the tags
Can we get an in-depth roster update of who has left?
I love this
Glad the game’s are back I can’t wait for devs half time team talks again
Which players moved on??? Glad to see Hashtag back!!
I know that this game is the first preseason and Devs played with 2 different squads but a win is always a win and actually a great one with 4 goal difference. I hope that this can happen again in the next game and I wish good luck to Frenford too!!! Don't forget to Hashtag it!!!
Toby looks like a great signing
I think hashtag United need to make their stadium
When will hashtag play in the Fa Cup
Jesse and Toby are 2 very good wingers, they should be in the first team for the season. Toby knows exactly what he’s doing especially with his dribbling and composure. Jesse has the finesse, he has brilliant control over the ball and can make awkward situation count for the team. So for the attack I would say George ST, Jesse LW and Toby RW.
Ngl, I wanna play for Hashtag
That’s where I train and it’s my home ground😍
class commentary🤣🤣
Edits on point today
Was Luke Wilson just away Or is he not playing this season ?
No question but just to let you know.. Your vids help me out massively
New LB looks mega decent!!
I CLICKED ON THIS AND WONDERED WHERES SPENCER
HHH gets worse every season
Seyhan looks a good player
Jesse is levels above everyone else🔥
Please tell me Tom Anderson is still in the side. He was unreal for us in midfield during the second half of last season.
LETS GOOOO FINALLY LETS GO HASHTAGGG
Hewitt looked class tbf.
So happy the lads are back, genuinely my favourite team to watch, love from down under ❣
Harry honesty needs to step up his game
Where is sam byles
Good to see Everybody back in pre season After the Lockdown have a blessed day people The best team on YouTube hashtag united god bless you all and your family Hopefully the safe as well 🙏 ❤️
Tobi man of the match
What Tier are Hashtag in
Do a first team FIFA competition 👀 no arguments then as to who is the best, I’ve my money on Lee!!
Hoping the turf doesn’t affect the boys form this year
Harry honesty is looking like he doesn’t like the game anymore I don’t even think he has scored In a long time I might be wrong I’m not sure
What’s the deal with Gill? Thought he was making a case for player of the season before the cancellation. Hope he’s not moved on :o
JWL is just too good.
Been waiting for this!! Good luck for the pre-season and season!! 🟦🟨
Would love to know who’s come and gone in more detail, it’s hard to keep track of who’s gone for good and who’s just not in a video
Yesssss ladddss so happy yous are back
Get a load of this Toby Guy!!! Real star he’s gonna be at Hashtag
JESSIE YAAAHH ❤️❤️
Glad hashtag football is back!
Greg looks like a boy in a mans game, technically looks good but maybe needs to mature abit
Come on lad's! 🔥⚽#️⃣  Up the Tags!
Switched on from the off this season we have some great players and squad depth .just need the right attitude 💪⚽️👊🏼
Sorry but Frenfords goal was pure filth and JWL is different class
Is there anywhere to find who has moved on from the club?
Jesse is the type of player, at this level, who will single handedly win games just through amount of chances he creates, quality player!
Are the players being tested??

FA CUP 👍👍👍👍👍👍🏆🏆🏆🏆 By the way Please sign me I know I am 11 years old and live in South Africa but please 🏆🏆🙏🙏🙏
Finally i've missed this
Where’s Luke Wilson?
Frentword keeper couldn’t save an excel file.
Why did jesse leave ? And what made him come back ?
If someone doesn't have twitter how can they know if you guys are holding trials?
Where’s samraj gill
About time! !!!!
Really enjoyed this 😂... Great commentary!
Cain Brougham was class
Finally,you’re back YES
George Smith acting like a proper wet wipe because he doesn't get passed the ball is my favourite thing in this video 😂
Some people watch but don’t subscribe?  Come on lads and lasses subscribe to this great channel. Professional and entertaining content guaranteed 😍
So glad matches are back 💪 excited for the season ahead. The new signings and trialists did well picking a team each week is going to get a lot tougher. The editing and style of the videos has taken a massive step up aswell the hard work doesn’t go unnoticed LP,  Stamp and crew.
Big year ahead! #UpTheTags
unpopular opinion: Harry Honesty is not good enough to play for Hashtag
Both half teams done well but the 2nd half team looked very good
Finally hashtag #️⃣ Are back
Missed these videos! Great to see Jesse back😁😁
Only OG members remember the original first team
good jesse back
kind of tomception in the defence :) #cmontags!
So great to see you guys back! That new lad Toby looks quality, and it’s great to see Jesse back!
Where's gill at?
The one Karen in the comments “ wHeRe iS tHe soCiaL dIsTanCinG”
Great win.
12:13 What happened there?
17:52 wtf was that goal 🤣
Imo there’s way to much rubber on that Astro...Slowing the play down so much
I’m sorry but Harry can’t score to save his life. On his strong foot and uses the same technique twice and misses both by a meter or two, exact same shot. And in his second chance I reckon he could have shot with his right. I know it is pre-season but it doesn’t feel like he was ever a good finisher except in the very beginning at hashtag
SO HAPPY IT IS BACK!!! BEST VIDEOS TO WATCH ON YOUTUBE FOR ME!
FINALLY HASHTAG HAS COME BACK TO FOOTBALL!!!!
Can we all take a minute to appreciate another LP masterpiece 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 @lewispreston next level edit fella ♥️
These tumbnails are really good, good job to the guy that is making them
Why did Jesse leave?
JESSE AND TOBY ARE GOING TO BE BEST PLAYERS IN ESL THIS SEASON, also really like the new lads that played LB and RB in the 2nd half, really looking forward to the season starting.  #UpTheTags
Do a video of the new players .... but also the players that have left and why they left ?
Is it just me or does Toby look like Justin kluivert?
I’ve missed Jesse
Harry Honesty still can't finish
Total Nugent there from Seyhan! Scandalous! #
Yes
Can’t wait for this don’t forget to hashtag it #️⃣💛💙
Triple h is woeful at finishing.
Do the players get paid?
Rate Hewitts performance
Gd to see the lads back in the game
We're back baby!
Bertug pulled a David Nugent lol
Dugout review with adjei and lp?
Let’s go!!! So happy to hear JWL and Matt carter are back... guys, you asked for like ideas for the women’s team last vid, I commented some in a reply would you mind checking It out?
You are premier league quality
Hashtag playing the Leeds United formation!
So basically Josh isn’t talking to me anymore loooool 😂
I haven't seen Hashtag United in a long time! I am excited to see how this team changed. can anyone tell me where Spencer and Seb has gone?
Thanks for the video,its really cheered me up when i was down.
Buzzing JWL is back.. That lad is a game changer! The lad could easily play leagues above.
What was the story with Jesse? He seemed to just disappear after being amazing for a couple of months. Did I miss the memo?
the day has come!
The editing on these videos are so clean, keep it up!
10:31 honestly some of the best commentary I've ever heard
You guys are going to be better than ever good luck I will be watching
C’mon boys
Ross Gleed, is the best! Ask him if he can remember me from hes instagram in lockdown, he learned me his freekick teqniche
Love that the boys are up and running again up the tags
