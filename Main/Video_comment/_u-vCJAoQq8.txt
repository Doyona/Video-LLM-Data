3:21 "It's the gesso that never endssss" "heh heh heh" I'M WATCHING THIS FOUR YEARS LATER AND MORIAH IS LITERALLY SO FUNNY LOL
Love it but the metal part really clashes for me
2025 anyone?
This is when I recognize it. It’s been a while since I’ve seen this video.
If anyone wants to know how to make a really good blend without all the effort, use a makeup brush. I got a cheap one from the Dollar Tree and I used it and it works wonders.
I have a Rosie statue. I love her. She’s the best.
I love how Moriah says the most normal things in the weirdest ways ( btw this is not a hate comment if it sounded rude lol I truly love her!)
Can you be more funnier than this?🎉
Who's here in 2025?

I had a idea i thought you were gonna do georgie.pickle.the two ice cream cats.derp+ Others and put all of the characters on the red bottom and top and have a glass rainbow with a question mark and the inside would be all tiny version of the characters but when you put a penny in it and then it goes down a slide(aka were the gumball comes down or characters) there would be a design in it were georgie is like a cute ball and rolls down and yes i liked my own comment❤

Look at you all that time ago and still all that gesso left so umm...its the gesso that never ends
Hi

I have that at my grandparents house lol its for jelly bells btw
Was SHE DRAWING WITH HER LEFT HAND!?
I am here in 2024 👋🏻
2095 anyone????
Speaking of paper Have you ever scratched paper and get that feeling
It’s called a gumball machine, not a bubblegum machine.
✨"He's nice and preppy"✨ Moriah elizabeth- 2021
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ N p r funny emails a
Please can you go to your family's house and paint a random thing #day 5
“Ok” “Prep work done” “He’s very preppy 🎀✨🌸💖💅😋”
Your kids will be so happy with this tho :0  (not first time I'm watching the video, just wanted to point it out now that I realised it)
Oops I ment  she’s almost at 10 million subscribers 😂
She’s
P😂
Soz
3:34 it’s so preppyyyyyy😂
Wow amazing(　＾ω＾)
3674  Moriah:I finally finished my geso
For the bit when she used the poscas on glass , I have done it before and it works but sometimes when you don’t varnish it first it rubs off really easily! It works in the end though and looks really nice!
at 3:24 her face just got me though-
I don’t like moriah I love her so much and she is the best artist in the world 😍🥰😘
I love your videos so much
Love it!
You could always cut a piece of paper to fit the inside of the red part that would match. Maybe?
I want that 😮
Your amazing
You are the best
you should make little clay blood gumballs for it!
By 2years
Your younger than my music teacher🤭🤣
12:32 what is this, I just want to see the bubble gum
Who else thought she was gonna paint the gumball machine pink? 😂
Also I’m pretty sure it gives you more if you turn it more
In other words “me wants to trace”
3:21 Thats fine. I wasnt planning on sleeping tonight anyways
Ok
12:32 why does it say frame needs analysing lol am I the only one who realised that???
Darling! The characters are so cute!! I would definitely buy this from your store!!!!! <hint hint> <pleeeeeeeeeaaaase!!!!>
M     MoriaI I mean colourful gradient😅. me rainbow🤦🏽‍♀️.
Meriaon sorry I spelled your name wrong but I gust wanted to say that you are the best artist ever on YouTube I love you and I’m a big fan of you.

3:35  Preppy😂
Yesss
Why is her table so high?
Moriah: ‘I’m kind scared of that hole..’  The hole: ‘*doing what a hole does*’
It the song that never in yes it go on  my friend some people started singing not knowing what it was.
She kept calling it a “bubblegum” machine. Its called a GUMBALL machine
I don't recognize ur voice but I'm ignoring that I love,ur videos
Are you left handed
How’s still here in 2024 and waiting for Moriah to 10000
I LOVE THIS!!! My fave so far ❤
I love it
I ❤ you I love your vids😊
I really wanted.
your nath is wrong 8 - 2 1/2 +  5 1/2 not 6 1/2
Ok, Moriah...inquiring minds want to know 3 yrs later (yes, I watch and rewatch your videos)  how much gum do you have left?  Was it all hard as your air dry clay and you had to ditch it?  Or have you and MiniMe been just snacking away on it?  😁
✨ Its the gesso that never endsss~ ✨
Whos here in 2024?
12:32 huh
I'm I the only one who never notices the background color change until Moriah points it out?!

“Boy you got a dirty gum hole” 😂
When will you do more fifth store makeovers?❤
9:19 And then you find out they are a beautiful swan 😌(honk the musical reference)
LOVE YOU MORIAH!!! ❤❤❤
In 2043 Moriah says hey guys i finally finished my first ever bottle of gesso!
Everyone has different art styles. Some people like realism, some like abstract and some like cubism or post-Impressionism. Moriah’s cute and playful art style is such an amazing style. Let’s all appreciate how she makes her art and style of videos so enjoyable, entertaining, enthusiastic and hilarious. I hadn’t watched her for about a year and then she came back on my home page of YouTube and I clicked on her and I can’t leave it. Thank you for amazing content!!
Hi❤
👇🏻if I tricked u    Read more…
Moriahs my therapist even tho she dont think she is she is 😊
dude you orderd 8 packs of bubble gum because 4 pluz 4 is 8 and 4 times two is 8
I love ur vids ur amazing girl!
so ummmm spoiler, the tool is ummm... a paper clip
gesso*
moriah:its the gessa that never ennnnnnnds                                                   me: (laughs so hard)
Put vinyl on the red inside if it bothers you still. I was going to suggest a fabric but youd want to wipe it eventually and fabric will hold in candy dyes and dust/candy debris.
Moriah very good at drawing people I never did a good job of drawing people
Hi
No
I watch you so much you are my favorite YouTuber you should not say sorry for your savior you should like your self😊
OMG I FINALLY FOUND THE VIDEO (*≧▽≦)
26 nice
Why do you sand the things if you make it smooth agen
I like your videos your videos ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Moriah should make a mini dollhouse
Please  name your pumpkin skwerl pom ski
123h how much  do.   you need
I personally think that the old gum/booger looks suspiciously like a little clump of ear wax 😂😂😅😅
I had a cat and her name was Lucy
Hiii!
2 years ago I always wonder if Moriahs designs take longer than a factory created
You should buy marbles and paint your all characters in blob form and put them in the gumball machine  Copy and paste if you agree !!!
Not 5he I meant this I got really weird autocorrect
I know it sounds weird but Moriah said,”Me wants (whatever she wants)” more then just in 5he video (she said “Me wants(whatever)” before?)
pUMPy the pupkin!!!
3:21 is HILARIOUS more specifically 3:24 OMGGGGOOSSHHHH
For anyone wondering, ya girl spent $151.92 on bubblegum
soooooooooooo cute
You are an amazing artist 🎨 ❤
10:56 no one can stop me from making this my ringtone
Morning glory
Why didn't you do the blobs
iloveher
my brother said you  are cringe
Me & Posie love it (I do not know how because Posie is a bunny
Liqwitex
Talking from experience of cleaning for others, that wasn't a booger it was dried up soda most likely with hair. Or as my grandma always called it, "Sticky shit"
Love it
Beautiful as always; I couldn't even tape the tracings inside the bowl, much less draw or paint them. ME is a very talented young lady.🙂🙂👍👍
may i have a bubble gum please      pass me the buble gum mashine
My teacher in first grade called me a Artis there where two artists me and a nother boy
Moriah say: painting on arrangement of colour no particular order Me: seriously that’s a rainbow 😂😂😂😊😊😊:D :)
I have the exact same gumball machine
:⁠-⁠P
Make a offer one and make them to gefer and call it birther
Moria don’t Kiss the bubblegum machine you have a baby
The time when i first discovered her YouTube channel
In other words… ✨mE WaNts tO tRaCE✨
How is it that moriah has the perfect clip for every moment
I don't know where this came from but everytime I rewatch this video I think Nilla is one of the characters of the machine🙃
I love you're art and yours sense of humor 😅❤
You should paint on a cotton candy machine!
The time flies remember when it said posted 1 hour ago no it’s says posted 2 yrs ago 😢😢😢😢
Can you paint me one?
👋hi I love your work  from  sapphire  xxxxxx❤
This woman has infinite gesso-
This is my favourite video out of all your videos
Can I adopt some leftover bubblegum?
My name is Lucy and I am always really shocked when someone has/uses the name Lucy because it sounds so unique rather than like Harry, Fred and Derek etc
It was  pink  then to yellow  then to pink 😅
Actually its once its 2024 that she finish the gesso !!!!!!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅😅
do a drow my lief
Moriah, you should try making a flip book.
Intro never gets old
3:21 it is the gesso that never ends! It goes on and on my friends! Some people started using it not knowing what it was, and they start using it forever just because it is the gesso that never ends!
Every squishy and every single thing she makes she would make more of it so we could have them I want everyone😅
I love the design it is so cute 🫶🏻❤❤❤
I have the same gum ball mechene
My lovely one that thinks that she should just like to eat a piece of gum every video until she doesn't have anymore
moriah literally raised me-  i mean i have a amazing mother! (father is not in picture, literally) i know she doesn’t like orange much but she made me love bright colors and now thanks to her my room will  be orange and blue!! (ik it sounds tacky but it’ll be light bc if i get sick of orange or blue)
The perfect paint on glass is fabric paint. It works fabulously  on plastic, glass, squishy, and fabric perhaps 😅
I found out Bob Ross used Gesso
Btw I am a girl im just on my dad’s account so…….😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love it ❤
Also u would have make chicken chicken popping the bubble and being scared
The chicken chickens scream was so jarring like        AUAAAAH
I really love your videos I just don't subscribe and like cuz I'm on my mom's phone
This is FABULOUS! I would love to have one of these! And I'm happy to see Rosie the bashful dragon again too! <3
Also I love how she says we all can't be winners instead of we can't all be winners
i love watching her paint like ahhhh
You know your a real fan when you start recognizing the memes.

The fact that this video was made a day after my birthday.
Anyone agree with me you always watch old videos 🤣🤣😄😄😄♥️♥️👋👋👋✌️✌️✌️✌️
Can we just appreciate if she works so hard to entertain us and make us laugh and she works for hours painting and more hours editing so let’s just appreciate her because she is amazing🫶🏼😘
My birthday is in 42 days And my grandma's birthday is in 9 days
You’re  such  a good artist. I  love  you’re  video . Do you think you are a good artist? Where can you vote A squishy makeover?I hope you have a good time making Squishy’s '!❤
I just love you 😂😂😂
look at the discription
Funny thing is it have the exact same Gumball machine❤ love you moriah❤
How old are you.😊
My name is Lucy and you called one on your squishy Lucy
Rude
Even though she was born fun
I love how she uses clips from her other videos to make it ⭐fun⭐
It’s a gumball machine not a bubble gum machine
GOODWILL?!?!?!?!
Ever since I found this channel I’ve just loved it! Normally every YouTuber like you is in some cringe attempt to get 999B subscribers but your channel is genuinely different! Art content isn’t just someone painting a canvas and trying to make a buck when doing it by making content with it! You need to have humor, it isn’t me and my family just being nice by saying YOU ARE YOUTUBE! Everything and every character you make is perfect in its own quirky, cute, funny way! Moriah Elizabeth you should be at 20000000000 billon subscribers! You make our days better in every way possible. You turn crying into cry’s of laughter and happiness! You are amazing and perfect and just a awesomely, friendly  reminder that the world is better then it seems at first glance! You are art in yourself!
I have a cat named Lucy. she weighs 20 pounds she is very FAT!
Me 2 years later watching this her nail polish was a prototype to her actual nail polish
Never put purple on the top Then blue after that never do it backwards rainbow or else the color friends will be here Only 1 of them is friendly it's yellow
Love it!
My name is Lucy YAY one of ur characters are named after meeeeeeee I’m famous jk
3:25 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
The after was so cute 😍
Literally made for her to paint on it 🤣🤣😅
Yes
Is that real bubble gum??
It’s the Jedi that never ends😅
The signature 😭😭😭😭😭u forgot it
Even you "ugly duckling" stage is better then me and my husband trying really really hard to draw something simple like a stick figure
Can you please try to make a video with no editing
She has 7.99mil
You should of made it like a bear with clay ears😂😊
Lol imagine that one person who likes price stickers
Owwww!!😵😂
deze +
wut has a 👗 🧤 👠😇🐦🔉🤷‍♀🐎🍊👦👑
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! my sound affects! i love em!They make me smile☺
your store is so good
I have a theory. The glass paint is used for transparent glass which is why it’s so transparent so that you can still see out the window well having it be very colorful.  Or not window, just regular glass. OR a GUMBALK MACHINE.
❤❤❤ my name is lucy😊
have you ever ran out of acrylic gesso
Me;👁👄👁💬
“But then I noticed”  *COME TO TURBOTAX*
Love this makeover. As a kid I received a random Christmas gift from ‘Santa’ and it was just my best Christmas memory and the gift was a very cheap plastic gum bubble machine but the point was it worked! And it was the best gift ever lmao, that’s obviously what this makeover reminds me of so it was great! LoL
I love your videos
Moo
SO CUTE😍
Art
I love her and her 🖼
Why why didn’t you put mini character figurines in there and whatever you pullout you customize so like you put a Spiderman figuring in there and then if you get the Spiderman one you customize it like different figurines are you customize whatever you get
9:34 im sure glass paint would 294’ fine
Moriah: Shceeeec (does anyone know how to spell that sound?)  Also Moriah like 2 minutes later: Woluluup
lovely work!  Kinda wish you'd given some love to that metal plate with the fancy engraved vintage swirls - maybe shone it up to a nice silver, or added a sealed metallic finish with dusting powder . . . gold leaf?  It's just too nice a detail to skip.
Do you like dogs?
Moria: shelpslep. Ok not more sUs: Thank u
ok ik im a little late to see this vid but can you do something without you characters and no rainbow
Your channel is the only thing i watch now. And i jave been a subscriber sence it all
did you know that in the description you wrote " pisode" instead of episode?
I wish I were moriah
Yes moriah you say you are a bad artist but your better than me I've been doing art for 10 years and I'm 23 I can't draw anything  you can your the  best artist on the planet
This is so cute l wish l  was half as talented as Moriah and l had this🥲
Yea your a really good artist 😂❤
Moriah elizabeth inspired
You always inspire me to make my own  channel and today I did
that was mine and my younger sister put a tootsie roll in it over night😅😬🤦🏽‍♀️
"that just looked like a screeching sound" as said by moriah
Can you please make tablet cases please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😻😹 ?!?!
Hi
I wonder how many of those big bottles of gesso she finished 😂
I don’t know if she even reads these but she is my favorite art YouTuber
Wait what dead skin cells😂
I made gorgy to
I can’t imagine a world without Moriah😂😂😂😂
Nelson ? U MEAN NELSON MANDELA !!!!!!OHH GOOD GODDDD HE WAS A GREAT MAN
you mean rainbow right
🤓 👇
Im a chicken
slink the sloth
Me love you so very very very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro she is so creative. I love how she us so funny i really appreciate her awesome crazy personality
That came out really cute! I love your characters, and having them all have a piece of bubblegum is great fun. So, in five years, when you go to buy more stuff to put in the machine, you could try to find bubblegum bags with only one color, then the artwork would be more visible. Just a thought. Or, just sort out your five bags into separate colors and have only one color of gum. Or maybe the machine would work with Jelly Bellys, and just get one color. Would look awesome, just so you could see your beautiful artwork better. IDK.
hi Moriah!!!!!! I love your art!!!!
Rosie is like my favorit caritter you made!
the "speshle tool" she used is a paper clip!😂
“That just..looked like a screeching sound.”  Oh so we can see sounds now?
Me..she is such a good painter   Moriah..I'm not good at painting
The chiken scream..🤓
I really like that that really adds character
I know I’m late but was anyone else bothered by the “bubble gum machine” and not “GUM BALL machine” 😅
I get so inspired by you.
Her: price  stickers should be illegal  * 1 year later she becomes president* Her: price stickers are now illegal if you have them the sprinkle song police will get you People with price stickers: what’s that sound? *theme song plays*  Them” mhaaaaaAHHHHHHHHHHHH Pickel: ITS THE PICKLE B.I OPEN UP
I love how when moriah or her fans have a idea she will stick with it
I love your videos😍🤩😘. Your videos ar cool😍🤩😘. You kan do cool staf.😍🤩😘
Maria saying I’m such a bad artist me looking at my art and I’m looking at her art my mind is she a professional

12:31
This video was so funny, and I was laughing for the whole time I was watching.
E
Hello my Elizabeth it's me Rachel Listen to that you use that to get off that off Not that tough I meant top I'm very bad at saying talk to Talk yeah I'm definitely 5 years old is OK
Bi the way you fokt to put wif roses no bubble gum
Your videos are the best!!!!!!!!!
Did you know that pink is not in the rainbow, it’s actually red
Who’s here watching in 2022 😂
I love your edits they are really good good work
it's like when she hit her elbow and be for she hit it she said you know what then she is it so it like she hit it on purpose 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My cat chose this by ramming my hand into it and I’m glad he did.
I wish that was on the merch store as the duck
She is other 6 milion matey Micah
Moriah "YAY SKIN CELLS!" Also her **Cleans it**
Cool beans
No no moriah your wrong the gum all machine cost 1cent and the dead skin particles cost 6-88$
You could paint on the clear plastic cover to hide the red inside of the "gum hole"
I love it so much ❤️👍
Nice ❤
Dear Burt (Grumpy Sloth),       Your owner, Moriah Elizabeth, has told everyone not to invite you to a party. How dare she say that about you. So here I am, inviting you to my birthday on October 10th. I really want you to have a second chance at parties and I really hope you are free that day.   Sincerely, Everleigh
I love her vidios
My name is Lucy and I love that character
My eyes are burning form the rainbow 🔥👁🔥
Me<3 you should put squishys in there instead of gum balls 🧸 🔵
Are you left handed or right handed 😊 Btw I SUBSCRIBED 🎉!!! I love your art ❤
I just thought of it!!!  You could put a piece of paper with those colors in the slot somehow!  Then you don't have to worry about chips or clashing!
The gesso that never ends had me laughing
Moriah in 60 years: OMG GUYS I FINALLY FINISHED MY TEMPLE
Emoji^
Maria Elizabeth why did you say it was seven it was eight😂😂😂😂
That's not a mini bubble gum machine I have one way smaller than that.
Do you know Elise Ecklund?
How dare you do not add pickle
I love how she uses her old videos as kinda a meme
Moriah just makes me feel so much better
Amugus
lucys elbow is acually in the right place if you look at a cat
Use water colours. Easy to blend
"Me WaNtS To TrAcE" 😂😂
to make it easyer to blend try and use a makeup sponge or a spunge paint brush :))
Am I the only one who never notices the background color changing until she says something???     Just me…ok.
Her: we're gonna use this "little" gumball Machine  Me :BRO THAT'S BIGGER THEN UR FACE BRUH
Can I have some
Fast forward a year and Rosie is a plushie
I’ll invite Burt my fav animal are sloths so ima invite him and he might even smile!
I thought that you were going to put some of your characters on the glass
Moriah: it’s looking worse and worse but then the angels came upon me and made my art be something of great  Her fans already knowing her art was going to be great either way: MORIAH, YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY, IT WASN’T THE ANGELS, IT WAS YOU MISS ART WOMAN
She is so funny even when she doesn’t mean to
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I love what you do
I love the finished product.Its sooo cute
Can you draw/paint your cat. Opie
Like on the glass
This is so cute I wish I was half as talented as Moriah and I had this 🥲
Idea if you ever remake this ( it’s amazing and doesn’t need to be remade just an idea) the bottom could be like the cupcake button and the top could have been the icing with SPRINKLES and stuff !
when in doubt, poscas out!
3:21  My stranger things obsession be like  Oh 🤌

You know that you could use heat heat to take off sticky price tags 🙂
It would be real cute if you could get marbles and paint characters on them...Then you could put it in it.😄
on the gumball machine glass i would have drawn gumballs ik its dumb plz no hate
Moriah: Sticks her hand in the bowl and says I don’t think I need to explain myself.  Us: it was expected of you.
E

You are so funny and intertaning

What a coincidence I have that same gum ball machine in my house upstairs it’s broken though and the glass is cracked….
Moriah should make a museum of her art when she retires her channrl

You can give all that bubble gum to your child
Instead of the name Lucy how about Glenda, or Gia
I feel so bad for James and Gabe
it   reminds  me  of   when  things     her    mmmm    arc    thing     hapened.
Moriah:I ordered 7 bags of bubble gum. Me: counting them up, (gasp) its 8 not 7
What if u just a crap ton of garnish  in a bowl and dump it on ur art piece
You shold make a anamashing whith pikle amd derp and bublegum I,,m 8  you dont have to.
I have the exact same gum ball machine exact
still crazy how this was recorded while she was pregnant.
My dog's name is Rosie

the sloth is my fav :)
I laugh at your vidoes every time I watch them Moriah! Love these vids and they are very addictive!
The scratching always happens to me when I paint smooth objects
The gum balls were probably to small that’s probably why they fell out
i like how u can see a drawing of fred in the background 9:18
Moriah: don't u worry my dear just stay with me. Me:IDC IF UR TRYNA KIDNAP ME IM COMIN
Wait u had to pay for it and pay to get gumballs?
WOW! You are so clever and blessed😃😯🤭

All your videos make my day better no matter what time or day you post it they’re hilarious keep up the good work!
I have that bubblegum machine too! Edit: I also got it for cheap in a garage sale (It was 2$)
Did anyone else notice the “new Frames need anatlzing screen
An abundant amount of dead skin cells,free!😂

You could have glass of hole where the bubble gum is

I Love her so much 💗 💓 💛 ❤🥰😍🥰😘🤩💝💘💌❣💟💔💖💗💕💓💞💜
This is my favorite on you did so far
00:12:46 what's Che Guevara doing in your gumball machine lmao
I love this its so cute and decretive.
i love how funny she is but also i think the reson it gives you more than 1 peice is beacuase those bubblegull looks smaller than the normal sized
My  name  is Lucy
Lucy is my cousin’s cat’s name
She deserves more than James Charles
He’s nice and preppy
I really like your videos and I like how creative you are. I really love Pickles and Georgie and Cousin Derp - LC age 6.8
Can you Eat The Gumball?
My brother said that you're really good at drawing
I love it
We need Gorge

MORIAH YOU SHOULD PAINT A CHESS BOARD WITH LITTLE PIECES THAT YOU SCULPT AS YOUR CHARACTERS! Basically one character for pawn and another for knight and so on! We love your work and hope you will consider doing this as even though it is a challenge this will stretch you as an artist (Original commenter: Julia May)
my name  is Rosie
You should make a series where tou paint on rubber ducks beacause i watch ur unboxing videos and you get a lot of rubber ducks!🦆
she is so talented it is amazing i wish i was that talented and her and my sister would get along great
This is so funny! 3:21
I love the scared chicken it's so funny
Rich girls watching this be like WAIT THE THRIFT STORE IS THAT GOOD
You should do something new
Her:nObOdY LiKeS yOu My pov:I can paint a garden stone in a flower shape even though I broke my r arm like…NANI
Great nice awesome video
Rainbow

The final product of this is my screen saver
2022’ anyone?
My name is Lucy! I love that she named one of her characters Lucy and it's the same as my name! Also I love your videos Moriah ❤
Is opie a outside cat or inside cat if you've already answered I did not see because I was looking a t moriah s eyebrow
My depression:Nothing can stop me!!  Me watching Moriah:  My depression:oh crape,I’m doomed
i luv rosie
You should have said when in doubt pasta it out
6 04
My personal favorites are pastel rainbows 🌈 alone, figurines and desserts  😋
Beautiful!!!! ❤️ and I want one 🤣😁🫣 love it! I am only 47 y/o, but I love everything that she does! 😁
8:10  Moriah: “In other words, mE wAnTs tO TrAcE”
She could have painted the flap
Anyone else remember Hannah, her “twin”
I have never thought of buying a gum ball machine but now I want to by hers it’s should be everywhere!
Why do you still use pastel on your artwork you what I like pastel keep going
I had a computer teacher with the name of Mrs. Gessop very close to gesso
I was literally singing iTs ThE gEsSo WhAt NeVeR EnDs
How do you make Frozen video
Your forever changing background created a rainbow effect 🌈
Moriah makes my Fridays get way better even if I'm already happy as I can be  BEST YOUTUBER EVER😁😁😁😁😁😁😁❤❤❤
I love it!!!!!!
ive just realized that she draws with her left land-
you should try minecraft it has so  many cute mods and I think  you would love creative mode, you can get infinite bloks and can build whatever you want.:3
Like exactly that
Omg I have a smaller version of that!
You should make your own squishy from scratch
Moriah: *makes immature addition*  Someone out in the world: “Oh uh, how old are you?”  Moriah: “Oh I’m 26, what’s ur point?”  Me irl: “BAHAHHAHAHAHAH”
Idea: u should put paint/brushes and you have to pain with that brush/paint
2:17 I was getting up to turn on my light and was didn't pause the video so I just heard Moriah say "Oh where are you going?" 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
By the way are you left handed? Sorry and I love your channel your soooooo entertaining❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨
Your nail is pink when you were holding the pink bubblegum add your name as agreed with you holding the green bowl game
ITS THE GESSO THAT NEVER eNds
Who is watching this in 2022
Is the cat me
The cat that you drew with the bow and everything and you named her Lucy my name is Lucy
Me farting bubblegum out me why does something smell like bubble gum and farts!
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈
Hi
Are you left handed
I love this. You could sell these
Hi Moriah do a vid of Q & A well do you like bts or blackpink  if you like bts then who do you like the best and if you like blackpink who do you like the most
Love it
❤
Moriah, I wish hiw many episodes and break downs how have helped me with <3 thanks
NEW CHARACTER IDEA: A Bear jumping out of a trash can Except its a Scrap bin and the bears name is  Amsterdam
I love your videos and I hope you have a great day and the gumball machine
JK 😂
I hate the bubblegum machine It looks so dumb and by the way you are also ugly and weird And I hate all of your characters how about you just stop YouTube nobody likes you
Paint a suitcase please
👍
me:”COME ON PEOPLE SHE MUST HIT 8 MILLION”
Moriah in 60 years time: guys I finally finished my first gesso!                                      Original commenter: heyo
moriah is one of the best and funniest YouTuber ever
Puppy the pumkin is my favourite if it’s inside of a gum bubble or in the pumpkin either way it’s SOOOOO CUTEEEE/ same as them all but puppy the pumpkins is really cute
She has such a cute sweater!
Moriah youAlways  makes me laugh and there’s never a good video without someone who inspires  me
At the end there the beautiful ducklings
Lol its the gesso that never ends 🤣
Her:I don't thing I need to apologize your use to it  Someone new:NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Moriah: Well I guess I've got gum for days now Me: I'd like your entire stock
IMPORTANT NOTE: someone may have already said this, since I’m way to the party(video) here. But you mentioned how it bothered you that the red paint was still visible in the dispenser tunnel. What if you painted the outside of the clear plastic? You could continue your rainbow pattern, do a mini rainbow pattern, a solid color etc. it may look a little odd, but at least then it would match your color scheme. 🤷🏻‍♀️   PS: if you ever need an over qualified assistant- someone to keep track of your background colors, appts, needed supplies etc, let me know! I’m up for the job!🤪 I say “over-qualified” bc I technically have a B.S. degree & masters in education, but teaching is NOT where it’s at these days. I’d definitely prefer something less intense. 😳
You said it was the gesso that never ends. Does that mean you watched Lamb Chop when you were a kid?🤔
The glass ball looks like a fish bowl
Moriah you are such a artist 🥰😍
No it doesn’t
Hi moriah, I'm a 7year old girl  who watches u at 3:00 to 6:00 AM I'm crazy anyways have a nice day.bye!
WHY DIDN'T YOU INCLODE GEORGIEEEE
OMG I literally thought of naming the s’more nut cat Lucy right when you said what should we name it
Poo
Where did you get the machine
I love wishing you, but it shood of Ben not ranboe
I Want it that’s all I have to say
My name is Rosie
I really love when you do your characters!!! This looks so amazing:)

Did anyone notice Fred in her sketch book
Paint a claw machine pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease!!!!!!!!!!!
Almost every artist can agree that drawing a side drawing of a cat is really hard lol
I think the reason why there’s a lot of bubblegum coming out was because they were small the bubblegum were small not big and round😀😭
Moriah: no more sound effects  Me:keep going if you like
Me taking apart my one and only gum ball machine,“ What’s this extra piece?… oh well, we’ll see if it still works.”
She's got  7MILL ION
I’ll take a bag of bubble gum lol
I like how she’s so. Sanitary

Hey Moriah or whatever I should call you, what about Thrift Store Thursday :D
12:30 "New frames need analyzing; click Analyze."
You can put all your coin savings in there for bubblegum and take the coins out when you need it
The butterfly has no bubble gum😘
Rachel
Love  you
Loving this makeover, the new one is so cute!
What is your real name???
This was awesome
Hi
I am still here rewatching almost every single video of Moriah
It’s Amazon.. you could have returned your unopened gum packs
Notice how on almost everything she paints on is one of her own characters 😀😂
Moriah: got a bubble gum machine from goodwill  Me: gets a ad from goodwill
Can you give me two packs of the bubble gum to me i really cravings some bubble gums
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🎀📿🔮🎆🌠🎇💒🎨🎂🍡🍓🍑🍋🥝🫐🍇🌺🌸🌼🌻🌹🌷💐🐚🍄🍁🍂🌿🌱🦝🕊🐕‍🦺🦙🦮🐩🦋🦋🦄

Awesome
5:21 that sound effect was just 👌👌👌
YEE
I LOVE SLOTHS NAME IT SLOTH OTH
She could use that into a piggy bank she could save money and also get a gum at the same time
Kinda hurts be to know that she had no idea the value of the vintage gimbal machine 😭
the gimbal machine grooves I believe had 7 sections enough for each section to be a different painting witch a color from the rainbow n I’m sad she didn’t notice that😭😭😭
moriah you can put foil in the part where the bubblegum comes out but anyway your bubble gum machine looks amazing  💖 lots of love from india❤️❤️💕

I saw her canyon crush add while watching her video lol
WHY NO PICKLE?!!
wow😍
This is the comment that never ends
I laughed SO HARD at 3:24
She talks to us like we have been friends for 50 years.
I love your videos
is it only me or is it my 100th time watching this
I just woke up at 6:00 in the morning from a zombie nightmare. This made my heart slow down. Thanks 😫😌
She is the one that you wished she was your art teacher
Turn the what now.....
Can you tell me when picle is coming.
Happy 7 million subscribers
For the sloth,s name is slowly
Moriah is the art teacher I’ve never had XD
U got one cent from that machine
Definately a different take on it and it definately works, I'm restoring a similar one myself in a slight Dr Pepper theme. While not identical based on the one I have I think your missing a couple of parts, there should be a Silicone gasket at the base of the globe which should stop it moving about when the Lids screwed down, the mechanisim is probably missing a restrictor piece as they come new with instructions to remove it for those just wanting free vend. You can control the amount by adjusting the metal plate on the wheel, just loosen the 3 screws and drop a gumball in and slide it to where it meets the ball and go back about a mm or two, that should set it to one ball per turn (or however many you want it set to based on position), hope it helps.
Rainbow
5:16 It's so interesting the things you can learn by 2 videos, this video and another one from her (I forgot which other) I learned she has tropophobia (Fear of holes) And with MrBeast in his "I got hunted by the military" and "If you steal this $10,000 diamond, you keep it" I learned he likes hanging up on people lol  BTW: Moriah, ur the best artist ever, I create a super different kind of art (Anime) but I literally think that your artwork is the most beautiful thing! keep it up ^^ and also, ur super funny!
Mariah I want to see I want to see you paint I want to see you every single Rock I want you to pick everything a rock you find
You could make a little thrift store with all this thrift stuff!!!!!!!!
We are on my
Friday is my favourite day if all of the day lol
Gum ball machine thank you

🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
I love this
Plz paint a squishy flower pot or a real flower pot
Moriah should paint on a used cat and use only your favorite colors
1:44 I’m instantly not hungry any more
Do Not among us🥺🥺
That fart about Nelson made me laugh 🤣
You should sell some of your paints and items even some squishies that are at so other people can make them and send you pictures of them
Rubbing Alcohol will take off any sticky stuff and stickers
I never notice the backround changes until she says it
This video was posted 1 year ago today..... wait.... what?
Please don’t use yellow it kind of makes me sick no offence.
Exactly a year ago today that’s weird
ME : whenever I see her gesso…it’s the gesso that never ends
there is 8 bags of gum tho not 7
I have a similar gumball machine and im tempted to paint the glass because there's a little crack in it
You could put squishies ghost up in the corner popping the bubble gum
You should put a sign on the back that says 3 for free!!!🤣🤣🤣
I meant initials
Did you know that her Initial spell me I said hey it’s Maria Elizabeth
What if you make tiny capsules and put stuff in them and put them in the gum all machines
You can draw good
moriah, my friend and me we play this game called the youtuber game and I always want to be you
You should take out the 2 coins , it's gone to waste. 🤣
This is my favorite thing in her background!
Me: watching your video’s. Also me: dying from laughter
Moriah is awesome
Literally I close my eyes for 1 minute open them and I see the terrified chicken and the noise 😂
Yoohoo Moriah got 8 million subscribers I am waiting for her to get diamond playbutton
U named the cat after me. !
YES U NAMED THE CST AFTER ME
Ehhhhhhhhhhahhhh it just looked like a screeching sound- XD
SHE HIT 7.09M YASSSSSS *plays sprinkle song* partay timeee😄🎉🎈🎁
there’s a typo in the desc 😈 *episode
Love it
I have the same one but it's blue
Omg we have the same bubblegum machine!
You Should use it for choosing sq
1 like=1 cry for pickles
Unsurprisingly I subscribed
Yeah we're all used to it
Woo hoo!!!!!!
Bum gum
Why do you like rainbows so much
Oh and also I got some Pasca pens for Christmas
I’m probably gonna buy a pickle plushy
I love Nelson he’s so awkward
I want to say thank you so much to Moriah, watching your videos had given me confidence to decorate store bought items I was worried about ruining
The puppy is my favorite 😍 ❤ 💕 💓 💛 💖 😍 ❤ 💕 💓
When ever she does a thrift store makeover she always mentions dead skin cells amd how she got them for free.
Pls turn pumpy(pumkin puppy) into a squishy😊
my cats name is Lucy
I did not read all the comments, so I’m wondering has anyone noticed that Moriah said while she was cleaning the bubble gum thing forgot what it was called, said That just looked like a screeching sound, instead of saying it just sounded like a screeching. I’m not trying to judge you Moriah, but that sounds weird no offense
I think it would have been funny if scared chicken’s bubble could have been popped
She should do some character animation because she’s so good at art lol (not intros) like animate a little story with your characters
i think think the more you twist it, more bubble gum comes out... but it is sooo pretty! Good job!
Moriah said that that she didn’t draw one of them popping a bubble gum but she drew the scared chicken popping a bubble gum
Hahahahahahaha I love it the lazy sloth made me laugh
i literally never notice when she changes the background colour until she points it out
I love this!!!
rozy looks like a pokemon
That is humorous
Hi
Rosie never called a bubble
hi i'm claire your vids make me so happy😀😀😀
Imagine woking at a thrift shop and seeing her walk in and get stuff for her videos😮
I like how she makes boring items look amazing
I have comeback.....
Watching this I was eating a giant gumball
Moriah pls I know this is late but can you ship a pack of bubble gum for me
It’s the Gesso that’s never ending
Moriah Elizabeth:  M : magnificent  O : one of a kind R : respectful I : imaginative  A : amazing  H : happy  E : excellent  L : loyal I : inspiring Z : zestful A : awesome B : best at Art E : everything I want to be T : the best youtuber on earth H : hard working  Thanks for being amazing moriah!<33

Why do you call it gesso Looks like white paint
when in doubt, get the posca paint pens out
when she said 'it took for' i thought she was going to say 4 hours but she said 'forever'
Has nobody else relized she’s left handed or is the camera just inverted?
Loved that lecture ab the base of the gum ball Machine lol.
It’s the justsow that never ends🎵
Moriah: this took forever!!!!! Me: yeah I know how it feels
Poor moriah first she says her arm is sour then she bumps it on her table 😢
I LOVE all of the designs but the scared chicken should of bin popping a bubble and being scared 😱
Moria in 1 year =I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED QAUTER OF MY GESSO
It looks so cute now
δηδγξηκξλξτς "¿?"?
ALMOST 7M
Good thing you have more bubblegum why        Restock
Ai LOVE your vedeos
i dont know how moriah has the effort to do this bc i cant even get out of bed im soo lazy
do not tell yourself you are not a good painter your a good painter better then me
how old are you TELL US NOW YOU are NOT 26 YOU ARE OLDER than that
You are the best I can draw is a little tiny doll on a paper and I called that arts
OK let’s try to imagine 80 year old Maria lol

I just noticed that when she says: “Hey it’s me!” She is just say like,” Hi!” She is really saying,” Hey it’s Moriah Elizabeth!”because her initials are ME as if she is saying HEY ITS ME MORIAH ELIZABETH!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Moriah you forgot to put a piece off bubblegum with the dragon! :O
u forgot the e
Lol you braytr
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!!
The first sketches of Fred were seen today... 9:06
please do painting people for 24 hours
please paint a portrait of yourself
once you get to the point where you have the first layer of the color layers, you might like trying to use the sponge brushes to do the ombre  part, put one color on one half of the brush and the other color on the other half, line them up close together, then *TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP* your way to quick pretty ombre (bonus: do a swipe along the line with the same sponge brush at the end to get rid of the bumps that might come up from the technique so it looks more like a paintbrush instead, idk how hard that part might be though)
You should redo some of your favorite squishys
She is so good at art
Do you like to go to a soe
26 wow that’s not that old
Hi am well you were the best in this video because it was so funny and I love it and I am call me, contact like this
The cat is named candy cat
i’ve been watching your video’s for 6 years! and i didn’t even know you where keft handed!! like how?!
The she says “i got a “small”bubble gum machine”
On my birthday I got a sausage dog that's called Lucy
didn't she say in her 'customizing a rubick's cube' video "AND NO MORE COMMENT BOMBS. (at least for a few weeks)" ? it's been long sence then. so lets start a new one... "customzing a Photo Frame with a design on every pane" please copy and paste this comment, and like this so Moriah sees this Original  commenter: Heather Soha
This was amazing but the silver part of the machine were you twist it you could have painted it in a metallic colour instead maybe
Where's my Bert fan club at
Me and my friend continuously laugh about 🎶it's the gesso that never ends🎶! Moriah, you are hilarious.
I love how creative and funny Moriah is she so FRIKN amazing!!!
When Moriah puts scenes of parts of her videos  Me : I need to watch that so I can relate and know why she dose that in the videos
Paint your walls.
her: dont ask me. me: did i miss anything? oo whats that
I didn’t know what the gumball machine was or whatever she called it that’s the first time I have see one
I think it would be cool if u customized your own dimple or pop it.  Kendall Williams copy and paste if you want to see it happen!
costumize a boncey ball! P.S. love your vids and you
I recommend using Mr. Superclear in the future to seal your work between layers. It’s basically texture in a can. It is toxic but it’s only when it’s wet & you already have the sanding mask required
Can you paint stuff from the dollar tree
That one works like my friend’s
TELL PICKLE  I AM COMING TO EAT HIM
She got a penny discount 😂
have you ever had to git a nuwe jesuw
u should use this for beads
Is it just me who has the gum ball machine-🥲
Where is georgie 😠 😡 👿
Love you💗💗💗
As soon as she showed the machine I knew she was going to do a machine from her squishies😂
Why didnt you paint the plastic tab? it would have been prettier than the red insides, Just a thing incase u want to paint that again
Agree
I like your videos
Goed show you
They need to make “POSCA GLASS-EDITION” am I the only one who is waiting for this just to see moriah use them?
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈
If you didn’t know you can blend colors with sponges like little sponges yeah those those blend really good and then if you just like put a clear layer over it’s just like so much better yeah I’ve used it before and a lot of my paintings and and it’s just lovely
Not 7 bags you ordered 8 bags
🖌❔
I love you
It a Rainbow you lier
Is it just me or you keep rewatching the same videos until Friday also I now call Friday… fri-yay
“ I’m scared of what’s in that hole”  “ das what she said”
One like equals one cute cuddle from the pubs the pumpkin
You’re such a great artist can you teach me please
you changed your backgroud colors 6 times XD
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈
soooo funny...........
I agree green  l
Can anyone count how many rainbow things she has Made?
Moriah: But then I noticed- *hungry jacks free cup with any meal* Me: well that was perfect timing..
Your intro played and I wasn't paying attention and for some reason I heard "good boy" and it threw me off for a second.
I have always wanted one of those old gumball machine! You got a great price! They can be very expensive! I am sure the antique collectors are cringing as they watch it. I think its beautiful!!!! I love how it turned out! Don't forget to sign it!
If your going to do rainbow mix it ok
You should have made the nervous chicken like, sweat a bit so the sweat makes him look really scared because...uhm...he looks scared? Well the sweat should look like this:💧
i have a "super rare specialized tool"
I love you and your vids you're. The best friends ever!!!!!!!¡
Ow thiS is great to be panting. On
Me:Is this bubble gum theme or something Moriah:Yes,of course!
I God promis when you were saying llllllll for the cat name I thought Lucy would be perfect and u said lunch what a quincidence
Bc your making a “ arrangement of colors” I like the background change
I’m just waiting for her to make bubblegum with her characters on them
Name the cat luna
Her:hits her elbow and just says ow  Me:hits my elbow*YOU FU***** B**** GO TO HELL YOUR NOT LOVED AHHHHHHH
LOL
I wish I had that!!
You didn’t paint the whole

I have seen a different kind of gum ball Machine  it as swirls In it and you watch it go down
Why im i not subscribed
Am I the only one wondering why one pack of gums is 20 dollars lol
When u named the smore cat i got reminded of my own name bc my name is Lucy xD
I swear she is so creative    .                                                          She is bob ross                                                                                                                                                                                         Haha you wasted your time I think...
Can u make a card set not forcing copy so she can see
I love it 💖

Love you Moriah!
Distraction to help me lose teeth

How do you paint on squishy‘s
I can not stop whatching you 😫 I have to stop soon 😆
THE GESSO THAT NEVER ENDS!!!
I love the very rare paper clip things
That chicken isn't scared...HE'S TRAUMATIZED. I think he's had some trauma before and he's still traumatized from whatever experience that has traumatized him.
Looks good 👍😁❤
I have not been alived yet I’m still unalived help
Her mind: I love this so much    My mind: HAND IT OVER
You should of had turned it into Benson from Regular Show
Hi
i want a gumball machine
This is late but it would of been cool if u did gum all blobs
10:17 she sounded exactly like beast boy there
Hi
i think she fogot to do rosies buble gum
love the finished product
We need to celebrate when she finishes her gesso
8:10   me  wants to *t r a c e*
This is beautiful
My mom is 43 yrs old
Moriah:let’s just paint something SIMPLE”    me:SIMPLE DIMPLE POP’N’SQUISH
thats Opie given to you
Your nails 💅 look soooooo good
What I watch after seeing some scary movie/series while its late:
I THOUGHT YOU WERE 15
When Moriah hit her elbow on the table I felt bad I feel you pain Moriah
Can you please like this coment because SHE IS THE BEST YOUTUBER IN THE WORLD 🌍
Omg you NEED to sell this I Would by it for $500
in 2056, that gesso container will still be half way full
Hi Moriah I was thinking for the red bit you could put colourful foam there so the gum won’t chip anything:)
If anyone says one bad thing about moriah i verbally would them
i was eating while watching her clean the gum machine, it was gross
USE THE PAINTED PAINTBRUSH AS THE THUMBNAILS INSTEAD OF WASTING PAINT ON THE ACTUAL OBJECT!
I have gumball machine but it has a stand
My emotion when i see her video: 😁😄😃😀😊🙂😐😑😕😞😔😖😣😫😠😡🤬 👆🏽
drops the computer when her face appears in gesso😶😮
14:17 end of video
What video did you make rosey/rose/rosy?
You should add this to your merch I’d buy it!
Bubblegum _____ was just playing in my head during this
you should put mini squishies in there
Love art and crafts ef
I LOVE RAINBOWS ♥️🧡💛💚💙💜
3:24 that meme tho....😂
Moriah:screeching  Captions:music
😂 (13:00)
I get the joke it's the gesso Never Ends but the real song is it's The Song That Never Ends
Nobody: Moriah always putting rainbows  💁🏻‍♀️👆🏻 Shhhhhhh
if i was you would make a noice little mario
Moriah Elizabeth literally is the “CEO” of RAINBOW! ✨🌈
ok??? so wad >:) hahahahah
If you wanna be my lover you should know gesso is my friend  I’ll make it last forever, gesso never ends
Moriah, you should be more positive towards yourself and artwork you create or fix up! You make and I'm sure will continue to make amazing artsy stuff so give yourself some credit because I'm sure most people can't draw, color, paint, or fix things, (especially squishies), like you can! Even sometimes when you say to yourself in your videos, "this is my least favorite thing I've created, it looks hideous" or something along those lines, I feel bad because I can't even draw a stick figure correctly. 😂 But anyways, I'm a huge fan and I love watching your videos and I do watch them every chance I get!!!!(:
There was actually 8
Let’s be honest here right now the video is NEVER  complete without “hey it’s me”
I wish that was a costume Product
when you said no more sound effects your just like thank you i said that at the same time JINKS by the way let me know if you need my address cause you o me a coke😂
Did she seceratly learn the way I talk because she said "in other words Me wanTs to TRaCe" and it sounds like something I would say
My day is not complete until I here hEy iTs mE
I love this makeover! ❤
No one noticed your reflection until you pointed it out
Hi moriha I'm  your  biggest fan
I love it when her face just pops up somewhere I can barely hold in my laughter. We see it so much but its always funny.
hi
When she drew Rosies freckles I blew on my screen to get rid of the debree....yea...I did that...
THE BUBBLE GUM IS IN RAINBOW ORDER
This is the gesso that never ends yes it goes on and on my friends someone called moriah emily brought the gesso and she used it forever just because (sing the song from the start to continue)
Do you mean the rainbow
I love the rainbow that you did on that
Gesso never ends🥵
This is my favorite thrift store makeover!!
Can't do better than that
That sounds weird like the meet of the artwork
She should make a “yearbook” full of all her characters, the seniors could be the oldest squishes, etc etc. (Someone in the replies also mentioned an award section such as class clown, hottest couple, etc etc.)
Guess what? I have that super rare tool 😃
hii
I just thought I'd let you know that there is a way to blend with posca paint pens. Search it up on YouTube it will be easier
Moriah: Already painting the body of the gum all machine. Me: Hey Mom! Where’s my geso? My thoughts in my head: I wonder what I should paint
Can we have a minute to appreciate how much Me_♡ does for us :)
can i buy this lol
I like the choice of characters
Ice cream Moriah will always haunt us
i love it
8:10 Moriah:Me WaNtS To TrAcE
"it's the gesso that never endssssss" yes it goes on and on my friendssssssss
This is AT LEAST the 3rd time I’ve watched this video (could be the 5th) because 1 or 2 uploads a week isn’t enough for my voracious appetite for weird. You could cover the clear cap on the bubble gum shoot with your Poscas so you can’t see the red enamel inside
This made me laugh so much. So thank you for that.
😁😀😀😀😀😀😁😀 gummm😉😉😣😣😣😣😮😮😢😢😡😡😅😟😟😟😟😩😩😩😂😂😁😁😁
thx for helping with my boring :( last week of summer ive been home shcooled my whole life  and now im going to shcool  ( 6 th grade)  any advice ?but thanks Moriah;)
That's probably one of your best works in my opinion!

12:32 what…?
00:36 that looked like it hurt-
I love your videos
I was waiting 4 Georgie
Id put some chocalte woppers in there or jellly nah, wait Mms
So thats the inside of a gumball machine i always wonder hmm
Gum hole, gum hole, haha wow, what unhygeinic gumball machine, well then it dont have arms 😆
Covid in them deadskin cells 😳
You are so funny
WHY DOES ROSIE LOOK LIKE FREAKING VOILET FROM CHARLEY AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY WHEN SHE ATE THE GUM?????????????????????????????? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I love your drawings because I tried it an it didn’t work
Can you make a vidio on all your memes (copy and paste)
This sounds stupid but can you use posca on paper??
Her channel just wants me to do art🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I  love her meems
Iove you
Do a 100 oragami crafts challenge
The versed patch postprandially attack because nerve ultrastructurally succeed under a last turn. interesting, lethal use
She should make the pupkin into a squishy!!!!
Oh sorry, I ment TheKay
Hay, read THEKAY’s comment!
The sloths name should be Berta
Tiny bit confused 🤔 why “Nelson”is farting out bubblegum 🍬🍬🍬 but it is still so cute 😍😘🥰
YOU TAKE WAAAAAAAY MORE VARNISH THAN HOW MUCH YOU ACTUALLY USE!
Rosie looks fat
I’m actually making a giant rainbow in my art notebook
When she said she could see red on the inside she could painted the clear thing that shows the inside 🤔😯
I love blending.
I dont like it                     I LOVE it
Omg I am actually so freaked out- whenever you said Lucy didnt have a name I just thought "lucy" then next thing I know her name is lucy-
Omg my aunt has the EXACT (before she painted it) gum machine
When you say “Hey it’s me” my question is ‘Do you mean your entails or you???’ Lol
The intro was so short 😂
You named Lucy the same as me🥺💞
YAY
lets all welcombe Nelson lol
this would be good for your new home that you are moving into
Wait where’s the signature…?
i painted the same exact one!
moriah hurts her herself replays it five times and doesnt say any thing when she edits her voice.😑
alternet universe: moriah is a bisexual e-gurl
yaaas💖butey and the bubbel gum!
OMG I am your biggest fan!!!!
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈
Can you do another baking video please
I love it so much!
Hi
Can you please make a pickle onesie if any of you guys want the same copy and paste this comment so it will happen!!
I found that glass paint and you're supposed to is it on clear glass so you could I use that but I guess posca paint pens are the universal problem solvers ( In Art )
Me: *just laughing at 5 AM recovering from jetlag*
those were great drawings
Moriah: you can see my reflection in the glass, that’s distracting. Me: didn’t even notice
You said no more sownd effects
In the next video you have to  draw a character in the Wall in your art room
Moriah:the geso that never ends Me:hey I know that song me surching it up on YouTube: Me singing the song:this is the song that never ends it goes on and on my friend
Love it I wish that was my gum ball machine 😔😞😖🥺🥵
Omg l love it l am  a big fan
Oh gosh, I was watching another channel and when she named the green character Nelson, it freaked me out a bit, because the channel is and ARG type channel where the Big Bad is named Nelson.
5:24 sounds like minecraft breaking leaves, or is that just me
Moriah should make a song about gesso. No I'm not joking, she really should.         "ItS tHe GEsSo tHaT NeVeR enDs" - Moriah 2021
Nelson is like the most embarrassed character that I know of
Her: so yea everyone knows what a gumball thing is.. yea… 🤚🏻 people who don’t know what it is be like: 👁👄👁👂🏻 well thank you for a example 👀
Memories
You can blend with water it works MUCH better
Yk once you've put your coins In it can you get them out?
How many times do you have to  paint a rainbow
Gum boll gum boll GUM BOLL ! Skin sell
👾😈😈😈😈👿👿👿👿
🤩🤩🤩🤩
😱😱😱😱😱
Imagine hatting on moriah
slow down your intros..
Me and my sister used to have little banks that were mini gumball machines but the gum tasted really bad
ive had this bottle of white paint for a good few years, and its still almost full!! i use ut often too

Bruh- the butterfly thing doesn't have a bubblegum thing, unless its body is the bubblegum-
I LOVE Rosie!
I know why you don't need the money you don't need it because it is a piggy bank so you can keep money init
Moriah: oh look at all that dust! My thinking: isnt that just paint??

you spent $133 on BUBBLEGUM...??😨 /j /nm (its her money)
U should spray paint the silver dispenser!
I would totally 💯 but that bubblegum machine would you ???
Her intro never gets old
Moriah in 20 years: "So now i'm out of gesso..." *Opie interrupts* Moriah:Do you like your painted fur opie?
I also agree that gooey price stickers should be illegal😂 I wanted to tell anyone reading this something really important. One day we are all going to stand before God. If you have ever lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain (omg) which is called blasphemy , hated someone (which God consideres murder) or done other things that are against His law ( the Ten Commandments), He sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, murderer. He will judge us, and because we have all broken His law, we ALL deserve hell.  But because He loves us, He became a human about two thousand years ago, lived without sinning, and died a terrible death He didn’t deserve because of us. Three days later He rose from the dead and one day He is coming back. We all deserve the ultimate punishment (hell). But God loves us so much that He took the punishment on Himself.   We broke Gods law, Jesus paid the fine.  If you repent from your sins ( sincerely apologize for breaking His law and turn away from doing it anymore) and trust in Him and Him only, your punishment will be paid for, you will get eternal life in heaven, and you will no longer go to hell.  I’m not telling you this to judge you. The thought of you going to hell terrifies me. I don’t want anyone to go without hearing this wonderful news. Thank you whoever took the time to read this.   If you have a Bible, I suggest you read the book of John. You can find many Bible apps on devices.  I pray that you and everyone who reads this will think about this seriously. And I hope to see you in heaven.  Go to NeedGod.com for a video version of what I just talked about. Check out livingwaters YouTube channel and livingwaters.com and also fullyfreefilms.com for a movie called Exit that deals with depression and suicide.
I love in her description she forgot the e in episode
It looks absolutely amazing!!!!
Well that's BOGUS! Made me laugh.
It's the Gesso that never endssss...
Lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow!
Dear moriah I would like to suggest for your next squishy makeover that you make a a squishy as a superhero :)
Moriah in 2030: i painted my art room
Throw back to when I was the first person to guess what she was doing
You know the song this is the song that never ends yes it goes on and on my friend some people started singing it not knowing what it was and then they started singing it forever just because...
Love your sweater
3:21 ✨it never ends✨
Susie no no lucy
No one  Moriah: THe MeAt
I already tried to paint on glass once with poscas and the scratch a lot so you have to do it very carefully
I'm like- WAAAAAA I WANT THAT GUM. SHAREEE. AAAAAAAAAAA
I love it and I want it
im currently painting mason jars (they where .99) so i thoght i would look at this vid for inspo =)
I really love this 🥺
Please do an updated art room tour including the blue couch room!!! Copy and paste if you want to see this idea.
make a baby for pickle  and  pickle me pink
I think glass paint is just supposed to look like glass
You colored the gum where the puppy is an orange
Hi
This is so cute !!! 😍
The clip where Moriah's face and the white background become one reminds me of that creepy ice cream commercial where the ice cream person eats themselves 😦
Moriah ur so good at art and beautiful ❤️❤️❤️  I love you
I have the same bubble gum machine same price and I did the same thing
So no ones gonna talk about how sarcastic Moriah is in all her videos?
This is perfect. Sooo awesome.
Hial
Pls do another art room tour 😇☺️
if you ever get another you could make it a mushroom i personally think it would be a cute idea
Honestly I don't I don't notice the reflection in the glass or really the reflection in any in any video until she points it out and even then I have to look really hard to find it
Does Moriah reply? Also loving ur content atm keep it up 💜
I love your veds ♥️
You are funny 😄
*you should decorate small bonus squishies at the end of every squishy makeover so you can fill the gum ball machine with the small squishies*
How dare people dislike her vids
Moriah I want to keep it clean as she paints the fart
why does that pumpkin pug thing not have a steam
was that gumball thing 6$.99
Leave a damp towel on the stickers for a while it gets it off
Anyone else wants to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈(all credit goes to the original commenter Olive Frost)
I have a pet called roise but she's not a dragon she is a dog
It’s really cut sim glad I watch this
You should put like felt or like fabric in the inside
rainbow.........Rainbow...........RAINBOW!!!!! No I actually really like the rainbow and I get that it's your style
Loveeeee ittttt
Hey I have a request you should do a video on testing out this app called IBS paint on the phone
3:21 can be a jingle for gesso

It is so cute Well done 🧑🏻‍🎨🌈🤩👍🏻👏🏻
What about GEORGIE

If she had a choice for rainbow or cat she will most likely to say rainbow
Sorry I was using the voice command
Mariah make love the wall video where you stab the walls the Needles
You should make a giant picture of all the squishy that you've made
You could have painted on the glass at the bottom and u wont see the red u cold have blended it in with the other colors
Omg it’s been forever sense I watched her videos
GEORGIE!!!!
Paint a whole deck of playing cards 🥺✅
What’s your favourite 😻 character you have ever created?
The colours of the bubble gum is in order
moriah ive ben talking to juniper

Hey moriah, it would be great if you could make another one of these thrift store makeovers. Squishies and stuff is fun, but this is my favourite! Thanks
She thinks she has to apologize for her behavior but it is a Comedy show for us 😂😂

❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Wowwwwww
hi
The demonic shampoo compellingly pause because bottle distally travel pace a amusing limit. accurate, inexpensive color
She is my top fav YouTuber
Nobody not even moriah  Me at 3 am singing her intro: aH oOwA aH owA aH dO dO dO dO yOi
Why does she criticize her artwork so much it’s is awesome. :)
I hope she doesn’t throw all the bubblegum away because I don’t like to waste good things that can still be used. Two reasons why I don’t like things going to waste is because things that u can still use goes to waste in the trash and goes in the ground and it’s bad for the environment. the second reason is you got things you can still use but never use and they go to waste like if you bought something that you never used that’s wasteful and one day maybe there won’t be that item anymore and you actually need it or want it but you let it go to waste
I love how she uses herself as memes! It makes the video so much funnier! <3
Omg I love this makeover!!!
Mariah that is not a mini gumball machine it is a large gum ball machine
When she fanned herself I actually felt it wtf 😬😵
Mariah i have my iced smore nut cat lets name her ll me:lucy  her 1 second later lucy
🙂😘
1:56 for real 😂😭
Moriah should make a yearbook full of her characters the seniors could be the oldest characters etc. She should include pages for class clown best couple etc
Moriah should make a yearbook full of her characters… the seniors could be the oldest characters etc. She should include pages for class clown, best couple etc (comment copied from Bella) like if u agree
It’s the gesso that never ends  It just goes on and on my friends Moriah started using it not knowing what it was And she’ll be using it forever just because… It’s the gesso that never ends It just goes on and on my friends Moriah started using it not knowing what it was  And she’ll be using it forever just because…
Plz do a pumkey in squishy

You could also always put smaller squishies on the inside of the glass instead of actual bubblegum
Why is the scared chicken making me scared 🤣?😂
Gumball
Name the sloth Steve! Pleas
Moriah -i don't think I really need to apologise for my behavior at this point  we are all used to it  . Le me - That's what make you SpeCiAl dear

How did you know I was randomly chewing gum—

Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈
do you actually use the machine or do you just grab it from the bags
The gesso that never ends, it just goes on and on my friend, some people started using it and we're so confused, but thats because it is the... gesso that never ends!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹 :00 look fellow fans the new emojis : D

I LOVE the cat in the pumpkin on the first coat of paint he’s so cute!
U said “7 - 2.5 =5.5”... how old did u say u were again? Love ur vids btw
You could put a little piece of adhesive vinyl over the gum hole (😂). There's a rainbow holo one from cricut that would match perfectly.
Moriah she is the best artist but she says she is a bad artist and funny
0:35 I feel bad for laughing💀
The living report additionally peck because nurse inspiringly tease between a superficial bulldozer. limping, minor toad
It does
The happy temper intradurally recognise because octave remarkably wipe with a daffy flute. abortive, well-off whistle
Anyone else want to see her painting entire card said it could be like a series and eventually she’d have a whole deck copy so Morton can see.
On the glass bowl thing you should have painted fish on it

I highly doubt that people would see my comment but I wanted to see how many people have the exact type of bubble gum dispenser before t was all painted because I do and now possibly thinking of painting it
The loud stick intrestingly slow because pen expectably stain amongst a overt cause. hysterical, belligerent swim
The color of where the bubble gum comes out will haunt me now..
My name is Lucy too
Pride bubble gum machine
Me doing the same thing on plastic with my poscas I learned from Moriah
Watching this video for like the 50th I’ve and just realised Mariah is left handed
The aspiring galley proximally fold because rectangle coincidentally bleach with a likeable australian. obese, equal arithmetic
Who wants to see some raw footage of her videos? Or a day of what she does?
Not to be rude but can you pant a pop it or pant a fidget there cool  pls copy this  and Moriah should be a model bc she so great  and pickle needs a series   ty for doing this
the background you need is pink.
Soooo cuttte omgggg

Moriah should paint a set of cards online so it doesn't take forever copy and paste if u think so
Super cute!🥰
mE WaNT tO tRacE
Instead of putting bubble gum in the bubblegum machine you should put tiny squishy’s
Do a third store makeover   pleeeeeeeeeeeeeese?
I cleaned up my mom's bubble gum machine and had to get help from my dad to get the machine to work
Any ENFPs? I think...Moriah might be an ENFP...😌
Moriah sees the base: “It’s free real estate!”
PLS DO MORE OF THIS
Moriah:I was not doing my best work here  Everyone:THAT IS SO GOOD 😊
My best time on Friday: hey it’s me  The worst thing about Friday: and I’ll see you next week bye
Am I the only one that just realized that Moriah is left handed?!
Ohhh dead skin cells so fun😂
I hate when she apologies because I love her she is perfect and my favorite you tunber. If you are seeing this Morigh I love you you are amazin!!!!!

I've been watching Moriah Elizabeth for two years.                   TWO YEARS
That aaaah. Sound scared my 🐶
1:45 almost made me gag
Did anybody realize the background colors she changed until she said she did
This looks just like mine from when I was little I’m kinda stressed now
so my brother got mad at me and ripped up one of my squishes... But bc I watch Moriah Elizabeth, I know I need a popsicle stick, rubber band and fabric glue to fix it.
Why does she think she is so bad  and  she thinks that she      is the worst YouTuber
I love the “in other words, mE wAnTs tO tRaCe”
WOW SO PRETTY. Moriah is amazing at crafts
Great video! but you need to use bigger gum instead of the mini balls then you should only get one instead of 2/3 😊
I 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
Hi

Moriah:Ok, im finish with sound effectes. Me and moriah meme:THANK U!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was thinking what would moriah be for Halloween I know gesso lol
Please stop saying stuff about the background because I never notice if you don't tell.
I actually never notice when she changes the background 😂
Yes I agree u should do that. It will be very interesting😯🤔❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Literally every single meme in this video is from when she turned into an ice cream
I never really notice when she changes the backround and I kinda get confused when she says she changes  the backround
I just notes that your darwing with left hand 😅👀😮😌
3:20 🤣🤣😂😂😂
I’ll be honest. Only reason I notice the background changes is because you point it out :’)
moriah please do a video with your husband, pls
Lololololooopoooppppp]lllllloooooooooooopp
The debonair marble systematically murder because shrine wessely coach sans a tedious balance. accurate, puzzling museum
Me after finally getting over my trauma. Life: Alright time for the next phase.

The “tool” lol
Stop drawing eyebrows on animals plzzzzzzzzzzz
Why is everything you paint is rainbow 🙂🙂...... WHYYYY??

Moriah elizabeth I think you should do more of these videos they give me ideas for art projects I do.

You should paint on a pop it
Do you know what my mom does it’s all the way to take the coins out and buys a new bubble gum and I need to get more pennies and again and again
Hey Moriah I'm Lucy and I'm 10 turning 11 and i just wanted to say hat i have that exact same bubble gum container except mine is old and broken and it gives you the gum for free without any coin.
ehehe      sHHHHH
for the red part you can put like fabric or something......
It came out amazing

You should make custom bubble gums
😂😂😂 squishy fan
4 1/2 bags left not 5 1/2
I wish that I met u moria
I will tell my name my name is Alyssa Lynn fraser
I think that this gum thing is a really cool 😎 piece of art
I don't know why but she calls herself bad at art. Well I do not she is 2000 times better then me. And she inspired me to watch her every friday
Day 24 of asking you to make your own squishy and paint it
Nobody:   The scared chicken screaming bc its terrified:     Yup
posca are used on glass but not in layers. the way i know this is because my mom works at a car shop and they put them on the windows of the car
Me: Pant your Art room I wanna see that   her: wtf u don't know how to spell me: ;-; her: ;-;  me: oh my god her: fine I will do it -_- both: TnT
Moriah when she was blending: this is so time consuming! Me: And that kids is why we use sponges!!!
you forgot to paint the inside of the "gum hole" but other then that it looks awesome!!!!!
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. (Credit to Charlie Dog, This was his/her original comment.) <3

I LOVE EVRY TIME YOU USE THAT CLIP OF YOUR FACE COVERD IN WHITE IT SENDS ME
Moriah should put a flash warning on her videos bc her beauty blinds up✨
This is my favourite thrift store vid...it was amazing👍
An yes the best ally to the lgbt+ painting rain boss on everything
You could paint where you lift up the thing to get the bubblegum
I’ve been wondering.... why have you not made a squishy based off of you?  (I don’t even understand what I mean ;-;)
I love you color painting things I think you should do more but one of them I really want you to color a Two unicorns and one here in the bun
she should've done gorgie
i wish she would do more of the thrift store makeovers
3 minutes in and she is still cleaning that thing XD

Your are  SOOOO FUNNY 😆 😆😆😆
Not rare to me
LOL
Let’s just except the fact that she spends hours every week on making vids for us without a break, instead of being mad that she doesn’t post everyday like some other youtubers do just love her for the way she is 💗
I appreciate you naming the cat after my cat 🤗
You forgot to send it if you do send it I don’t know OK
So clean and clear UwU
omg I just realized- Moriah didn't use sprinkles today...        THE WORLD IS ENDING YOU GUYS
Moriah: gooey price stickers should be illegal 😒😒 Gooey price stickers: why would you say that about me liek that kinda hurted 😖🥺🤧
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈
9:54 “oh no, oh no, oh no no no no”     i’m sorry
queen this is one of my favorite Thrift store makeovers! 😋💖🌸🌷🌈🦋🐾✨
Wow , Moriah are you left handed ? I heard that people who are left handed are more artistic than people who are left handed ? I right handed , i literally just noticed that your left handed , thats really cool!
hi i am quite young and i really would like to start painting on squishys what are the main things i need
The same color bubble gum as her nails 💅 13:13 look
it is for bigger bubble gum(s) that is why more small ones come out
Anyone else get jumped scared when she put her face in the gesso
Hi! I was wondering if u can paint simple dimples ( fidget toy ) and turn them into your characters.
there was 8 bags on camera of bublegum
who else looks forward to hearing the "Hey its Me" every Friday?
I never knew I liked art this much 💜
I I actually painted a  she 🐚 Shell
I love your videos I been watching for 3 years I had a bubble gum machine a mini one but it broke and don't where it is pls heart my comment you are my most favorite youtuber and your videos are so funny😊
You should've made it a person. Bottom the body, bowl a head and add eyes and a mouth, top thing a hat
Fun fact: people want Moriah to start the ‘painting on rubber ducks’ series
These gumball machines are the type of thing that would be useless to have multiple lying around (even one is probably pretty useless to most people), but it could actually look great to have a collection of them in different designs - painting different characters in the panels/columns of the bodies to not have to deal with the ridges, using the beloved fruit and/or food and/or desert designs, using the base as a beach scene or something and turning the glass into a fish bowl, etc, etc.
It's great to see how thoroughly she cleans and preps the things she's gonna paint instead of half-assing it.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. She shops at goodwill😖😖😣😣😩
Hey did you have a Dyson vacuum I have a Dyson vacuum
7:39 Listen to m.e say “dont invite him” in 0.5x speed. It’s sounds like she’s sorta moody, not “Burt” 😳
Moriah: “it’s the gesso that never ends~” *HeHeHHHheEEehHH 🤍👁👄👁🤍*
so so so so cool...........
I saw this same bubblegum Machine at a gas station, selling for 39.99....
ME:Creaking noise Captions:Music

Gimme DEH sloth!!
Moriah:m* acts like she’s overtired* Me: oh my she’s here rn-
(when she changed the background colour counter) 6 your wellcome for my useless info!
MORIAH ELIZABETH!!!!! TO MUCH RAINBOW 🌈🌈!!!! I'm just kidding I LoVe rainbows. Got u there didn't I?

Arent we gonna talk about the Gesso it look like the same amount evertime when she show it
I've never seen a bubblegum machine before

I’ve actually seen that bubble my gum shit at Goodwill I’ve really wanted to get it well I’m happy you got it
they say karina Garcia is the queen of crafts I think moriah without a doubt is the queen of crafts 👑😁
I’m so happy she cleaned it due these times 😅
So cute!
Can you please do a baking kit🙏🎂
We’re not dumb we know that the rainbow
no particular order huh lol
Moriah: Hi it’s me  Me : I thought it was him Lolololololol
this turned out amazing. so so so cute 😍
Love 💘 😻 💜 💛
Can you make a gum ball machine full of mini squishys? Called : Mini squish machine
Omg, I watched her when I was younger, and today I just randomly found her again 🙂  Omg (again), found her again and also found my comment! Wow this is such a coincidence!
Ugly sound effects
Omg so rare lol. You should make a song for gesso
Bro imagine if she was our art teacher
Does she realize if you twist the red top the screw will come out so she didn't need to struggle  ?
Bruh she painted on the same gumball machine I have at home !
who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserve basic human respect copy/paste to make her see this
I WANT THAT IN MY KITCHEN 😂
Gesso be looking sus
2
She is just like “No more sound affects” Later” fart sounds”
All the people here have SO MANY LIKES but not meh:(
Actually it’s three in a half
I love it
moriah if you're reading this, i have a tip to keep your paint strong without using varnish: Take it to the gym and you will have this big buff blob of paint
REEEEEEEEE IDK why but i get so annoyed when gesso or paint is patchy 😂
Awesome 👏
This is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some people started singing it not knowing what it was and they continued singing it for ever just because, this is the song that never ends,...
I liked the uh the part when she did art
I love the look at the end
What if she got rid of that when all her characters are in there and someone got it and was like “what are these things?”
Gum hole sounds wrong
Moriah: *Thinking of what to say* Minecraft Music: WE COME TO GOOD USE 3:59
There is always one advert that is just anoying
we need shelly and eustace plushies!
3:24 oh my goshh that scared me!
i love them
Everyone: (most probably) leaves when moriah says "Thank you so much for watching...." Me: litterally watches till the end just to hear the outro music...🤣🤣
I legit have that bubble gum machine
The gesso that never ends...   2 months later she looks in the jar to see it still full 3 years later she looks in to see even more gesso DUN DUN DUN
moriah: gum hole all i can think is: bum hole  lol  i just picked up dog vomite it looked like biscuts and gravey
I love this video and I love that machine I wish I have a talent to make a machine look that pretty
Did anyone notice moriah uses her left hand to draw...?
9:44  Me: IT CRASHED AHA
Instead of painting the inside of where the bubble gum drops out you should paint the flap on top of it
I like how she doesn't needs memes in her video she uses her old clips 😁😂❤️
THAT IS 8 NOT 7 moriah
My grandma has a cat named lucy
P Po Poo Poop Poopy Poopy b Poopy bu Poopy but Poopy butt Poopy butt f Poopy butt fa Poopy butt far Poopy butt fart Poopy butt far Poopy butt fa Poopy butt f Poopy butt Poopy but Poopy bu Poopy b Poopy Poop Poo Po P
My sister is 26 too
Watching the bored sloth remembered me that my friend is going to get pet sloth... *sudden moment of realization* OH MY GOD MY FRIEND IS GETTING A PET SLOTH! AAAAHHHH
When she says: “it’s the gesso that  never ends” and put her face from the cupcake video inside it of her laughing… It left me dying lollll
Video idea: empty the gumball machine and write down ideas to paint on paper. Crumpled them up and put them in. Put a coin in it and see what idea you get.
Are you married!just curious😂
I never thought about it but do you sit in silence doing this then Edit in your voice oorrrr
Elizabeth: I'm using this rare thing Me who has a box full of them in my house: I've became tief
moriah how do i still have gesso in my contaner but I  use it all the time me cuase it's so big and tall
rosey and lucy (is that the raindow smore cat's name?) also have a rainbow on them! good call moriah
Butiful 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You should paint on POP VINYL FIGURES
You SHOW ULD PAINT ON BOOKS
Nelson is my friends dogs name
I had a mini heart attack when your face appeared in the gesso
Moriah says Gesso correctly: ✔  Me thinking it said Guessoh: 👁👄👁
I just realized looking through the comments that moriahs comment section might actually be the nicest and most supportive one I’ve ever seen
What happens if you put a nickel in it do you get four or one lol

Hey where can I get that specialized tool?

Why is no one talking about how cute her sweater is? It is so cute!
You can put rainbow colored paper on the inside of the machine where the bubble gum comes out

I’m 23 and love her videos
She got that for such a bargain, I’ve just look for a bubble gum machine in Amazon and I found the exact one she used in here with a stand included for £207 - good find haha
Hey I just thought of another way to use a bubble gum dispenser. We can use it as a piggy bank by putting our money through the top and taking it out like we do to dispense bubble gums
Anyone else want to see her paint an entire card set? It could be like a series and eventually she'll have a whole deck!! Copy so Moriah can see but try to be careful we don’t wanna force her! :)🌈

Moriah: I don’t think I have to apologize for my behavior. I think we’re all used to it.  My friend: no u don’t have to apologize, my sister is more annoying and crazy.
Bruh I’m Lucy
How many ear piercings does Mariah have.
when she was blending the colours I actually screamed at the screen " USE A BEAUTY BLENDER MORIAH *insert Terodactyl noise here*

Yeah how amazing she should know what she will do all the time and chose one idea to do on her YouTube channel
I actually thought she would have the scared chicken popping the bubble scaring him and not having him float off with the bubble
Is it just me or does the new one look taller on film?

I don’t know why y’all always complain like if you are annoyed by how many rainbows she uses or if she make a mistake then just leave and stop watching her videos or just don’t comment about it
After a request or aggressive demand, let’s start another: “who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserves basic human respect” copy and paste if you agree 💖 (not my original comment)

A really cool idea would have been for you to do the bottom part ocean theme and the top leave clear and paint little fishies on it!

She wasn’t kidding about cleaning every peep
i hope she eats the gum and not make it decor like well or her other thing in the art room
Moriah, I like your videos for many reasons but one that come out first : I have adhd and I can watch a full video without doing something else and that's amazing, the rhythm is so perfect to me that I don't have to put the video faster and omg, that's so niiiiiiice  and you're funny  and I love rainbows  and you are funny  I feel like I already said that  anyway, thank you for your amazing videos! bye bye!

Why do you always do rambow?
3:21  I’m DEAD
I love it when she says “ it’s the gesso that never enddssss”
Did you really think she wasn’t going to use rainbows 🌈?
Who else thinks she just made that turning myself into a cupcake vid for the memes I swear in like every video there a bit of that video in it XD
Moria! Can you make a video about opie
it is 8 bags of gum not 7
The womanly science ophthalmoscopically squeeze because cat superficially paint astride a red seaplane. zippy, nonstop improvement
The better lace chiefly watch because airport presumably scatter pro a spooky stinger. hard-to-find, wanting geology
“Ma’am, it’s says ‘Please Do Not Touch The Gumballs’.”  Moriah: “Why are they there then?”
Why is my spirit animal Burt?
Mariah more like moron
4:17 *in no particular order*
Moriah: im choosing some characters of mine that are probably unfamiliar and they don't get a lot of attention Me: Just started watching her a month ago and know who everyone single one of those characters are from constant bingeing
Gesso really be like 😳 im wowed about myself i got so mich in me and i have a suggestion you should try and make your own squishy

When Is she going to realize that we actually like the spontaneous background changes? And that we wouldn't ever comment about them or even really notice them if she didn't point them out? Moriah, u truly are a complex human being, but I have had a lot of fun figuring you, so thanks for being you! You are the true Queen of Diy, and I hope you know how special you are! ;}
Love you Moriah! ! 💖 💖 💖 Please do the watermelon squishy from the hopleless  (almost) bin please! Repost and copy this everwhere! !🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
Moriah gotta stop hating on herself and her talent. She is so creative and hilarious. I discovered her videos during such a hard time in my life and it just boosted my spirits. Plus her art style has inspired me in my own art. Moriah is the best
We need to remind her to do the easter squishys
I have a jumbo squishy strawberry
after a request or aggressive demand, let’s start another: “who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserves basic human respect” copy and paste if you agree
I love your videos😍🙀     It was so creative
7:00 farting out the bubble gum just like Brown from Aardman Animations Purple and Brown
1:56 use goo gone spray gel
did anybody notice she said "pisode" instead of episode in the description
she has triphophobia, the fear of holes, she just doesn't know.
Wow a day before my b-day! i remeber that, sorry i was late on commenting
Was it only me or at 4:00 there was Minecraft music in the background?????
Thé top look like the bottom of a toilet plonger
hi I was wondering I have a gumball machine as well and maybe I could pay you somehow to paint it and maybe you could feature it in a video? :D
You should make Burt the sloths wife REALLY HAPPY!!!!
Wow!
I love your videos very very very very very very very very very very very very very much!.
I love this its one of my fav. This is so super cute!
It looks very  hard to paint.
I’m going to love the video
Ok but why does Nelson kinda look like a nervous plankton
When moriah was doing a close up of the gesso and put her face in there it scared me lol
Moriah Easters soon plz paint te Easter egg squishy
When she was holding the green pin... Me: wait... she’s LEFT HANDED!?
I’m obsessed with Moriah. Your my fav YouTuber and I only have the app YouTube to watch your videos! Keep up the amazing work and art, your incredible ♡
When ur probaly a month or 7 weeks late and ur back hurts: that’s me I knew taking a shower was a bad idea now my back hurts ;-;
i wouldn’t have realized her face in the Gumball machine if she didn’t point it out
That shirt looks so good in the rainbow sweater 👍🏻
Every time I think “ooh, I should paint/decorate/customize one of (INSERT RANDOM THING) for my channel.... surely nobody has done that!” I stumble across a video from Moriah who has just done the exact thing I had in mind.   I literally have a slightly different gumball machine sitting in my garage that I was looking at yesterday, wondering if it would be a fun paint pen project.  Love your videos. But I’m going to have to keep working on some more original ideas! 😂😬
She must make custom coins for the bubblegum machine!! Who agrees??
Paint your paint brushes!! LOL!!
Win in doubt Posca it out
moriah in 60 years: guys i’ve finally finished my first container of gesso!!

I have that bubble gum machine
Hey babe, absolutely love your work, I watch your channel with my daughter.   I just wanted to mention, have you ever tried to use a small sponge for blending? :)  I love the it! Looks so good. Also I think it would look really pretty if you spray painted the front metal plate to freshen it up a little?
lol does anyone else want her to decorate a fish bowl then use it to store pencils or paint
Moriah: i am just painting random colors Me: OH NO SHES DOING RAINBOW SHES GONE CRAZY WITH RAINBOW  (i mean i love rainbow too idk why am saying this =_=)
hi
Okay you did add some characters but why didn't you add anything on the bottom like stickers
Hi Amaya so I I think that's your videos are very cool and I love The artsy and all the other stuff but I don't like when you said in your video that you're not going to go all out could you please reinstate that like just like I don't know put a few characters on there some like maybe families or couples or even put a sunset on the gum machine and put a sunset and a couple buildings and a little bit of rain and that will just be perfect too
you might be the reason i still drink out of a sippy cup im 11
Who wants to see Sam try to do a squishy makeover?  Just me... ok
anyone else just slightly bothered by the fact that she sayin bubblegum machine instead of gumball machine??😅😅😅
I hav dat bubble gum machine
It only gave more than one gum ball because they are small bubble gum balls rather than the normal size ones
your hair line is getting better and better!!
Omg could u by any chance could u  make non food squishies  in ur squishy  bakeovers
Moon sun moon moon sun shining moon moon shining moon sun moon shining

you should put charms in it
it was amazing 🤩
Can u paint your art room's table,n make a vedio?
Video idea.  Moria gets a bunch of things to paint on. She wrights down what they are on like paper, puts he paper inside like little plastic balls. She puts them inside the gum ball machine to randomise it.   What she could paint could be like Moria  pre-designs all of the art to be painted in a certain order. What ever she gets from the gum ball machine Moria will paint it on
The reason you get so many bubble gum is because the bubble gum that you put in it are to small.
I just luv her she's amazing
...
I loved it when she said it’s the gesso that never ends!                Hi
Me: watches this while editing yt vid Also me: stops editing and watches this instead

Its the jest that never ends
I wonder if she would use it...bc i would love a mini gumball machine
Can you please make the Gumball machine a squishy
I think the bubblegums falls in twos and threes because they are a bit too small and supposed to be bigger for the machine. (Sorry for my bad english)
3:03 that is a dirty napkin
You should paint a coffee machine
Pls do a diamond painting plss
Never stop doing rainbows 🌈 more more I need more 🌈
I like how when  she looks at her stuff she sees it as something horrible and then I'm here making stuff that is just WONKY 😂
Moriah : this   Me : pauses video of her hinging it and taking a screen shot
If I was drawing on the glass I would probably draw it upside down by accident
Reminder: Paint the Easter squishies!  I'm going to comment this on every video from now on.  COPY AND PASTE TO GET HER TO SEE IT!
same she is the best
I love your channel
I just came from school and today was art but the black outline made me think of my drawing
Like what moriah can do is more than I could ever do . 🤓😀😀😀
Eee
Who wants her to paint a whole wall dedicated to one of her characters Copy and paste if you want her to do it
Moriah!!! I want this!!! It's so cute!
Moriah why don't you start a  cartoon based on yoir characters
I love how it turned out its beatiful

Pin ME NOW!!
I found a cobweb gotta vacuum that up.  Bubblegum = food food = needs to be clean needs to be clean = no animals cobwebs = spiders  was there a spider in the bubblegum machine-
Rosie aww. 💖🐉
You should try and make something without using really colourful colours I guess like really dark shades and stuff.
Make a animation series it would be cool.
customising a wallclock
You should try drawing anime 💜 😎Just to see you suffer😎
Hi Moriah! I'm sure you get a lot of comments like this but thought you'd like to hear the positivity anyway :)  I have a toddler nephew who watches content farms when on his own with the YouTube app and whenever I am left responsible for him, I always tune in to your channel because the colors and editing appeal to him. He's very in love with your work and while he can't remember your name, he gets very excited to see the "ME" logo and says hi back wanting me to tell you he loves your videos and can't wait for more.  This was the most recent one we got to watch together and he was very happy to see the result!   Until Friday, stay safe!!!!
U should of named Nelson Frank!
I LOVE THIS ENDING DESIGN 💕💞💛💚💙💜
Who else loves how she      "memes" herself?
loved it
can i have some bubble gum i am not alowed pls can i pls
Who else really likes the yellow background? 👀
on first i think that. she is the best but know she is the worst bcz in and everything she does rainbow theme
The conscious cast rarely part because plastic customarily bore midst a beautiful dinghy. yummy, material good-bye
Moriah: 5:15  Me: Hey! Don't ask what's in somebody's hole!
The gesso and the color used in this video is GREAT thats what makes her unique
Moriah: so let me show you what I got Add: *Its my time to shine*
I agree with the gooey price sticker movement
Yeah prices should be illegal 😡
"Its the gesso that never ends..." ( o = ♢ = o )   ○ ♡ °•  ☆ ~*                                                                                                , * ~ ☆
Just play it off, you ment to change the background color,if you didn’t say it keeps changing,I would have no idea
💜Yay!!
11:47
Is nobody gonna talk about how it while she’s showing the gum it says “Frame not analyzed for stabilization” Just me? .... Ok.
Moriah: Is this the first time you've ever wiped up there cause boi you have a dirty gumhole  Me: Dirty bumhole    Lmao this comment is cursed
"mE WaNtS tO tRaCe" ~Moriah Elizabeth 2021
Too bad that my country does not allow gum (no offense)
if you add white in between the yellow and green it might be easier to blend
Gggg
I got a recommendation! Theres a thing called Goo Be Gone that you can use for gooey stickers and other gooey stUfF- ^^
Lol wait hold up she has a pencil with her charicters on it dont believe me? well 6:08
Is it weird you named your cat drawing Lucy and my name is Lucy and I love cats
It turned out so cute!!!
Who tink’s that she is almost Bob Ross cuz she is good idk how to draw perfect circle lol
Indigo is part of the rainbow.
Can you send out ploshies
Can anybody tell me in which video she made the galaxy type norwal idk how to explain  it but if u k ow what I mean  then can u tell which squishy makeover no. that was?
2:11 I actually dont know what those are called I just been calling them a paperclip, what're those called ? She using to open the lid
asmr
I think it’s so funny that all of the characters are doing something different with the bubble gum and I really like that it’s in rainbow order. 🌈
And next, a popcorn machine...
I wish I could paint like her
I ment you got 8 bags
The butter fly doesn’t have any gum
When she says “7 more bags” she means 8
Okay everyone, we all need to remind Moriah to start painting those squishies she has been saving for easter. She told us to remind her 1 month in advance. Copy and paste this so she can see this.
She's so creative lol
Moriah:I’m going to paint the top the same rainb- I mean pretty multicolored stripes in no particular order :)
Bored?~ Watch Moriah Tired?~ Watch Moriah Hungry?~Watch Moriah Supposed to be sleeping?~WATCH MORIAH!
Love this
You should customize a pop it
Mariah: I’ll see you next Friday  Me: literally waiting for next Friday
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THRIFT STORE MAKEOVERRR!!
Ok, I just have to say, that machine is a money bank, I have 1 and by getting gum, Ur saving money, it's not broken, it's whole thing if to keep ur money.
MORIAH!! this is me giving you a REMINDER to do an EATER VIDEO as you requested. hopefully it is enough ahead of time, and you see it. Im sorry for the spamming I'm about to do.

Last night I watched this video. Then I watched Cheaper by the Dozen. In one scene there was THIS EXACT gumball machine in the backround! So cool!
My mom named her mini black van Lucy XD
Pin meeee please
I have an idea. You should paint marbles and put them in the gum ball machine. You can paint them to be whatever you want. Pretty colors, pattents, rainbows, characters, whatever you want.
Moriah pay attention to this comment OK you can use chalk markers on glass
PLEASE MAKE A DALMATION PUPPY IN A DROGON FRUIT COSTUME
maybe you should take the same item and put gesso on one side and acrylic white paint on the other side and see if there is a difference
me: omg i dont think there will be any sprinkles in this video someone  call 911   oh wait theres a rainbow cancel that pls
it looks so good
Igsacly Yeah you know

Hey stop being mean to yourself because you are the most creative most beautiful most like me person on YouTube and if you don’t appreciate yourself that’s just messed up because you are the best
qwertyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
U should of painted a character on the plastic door where gum comes out
The scared chicken is back! YAY- **insert chicken scream**
I have the same one but it’s on a big stand so it’s off the ground I got it for my birthday like three years ago (also I’ve found it doesn’t work too well with mini gum balls bc of the slot sized so they tend to like skip thru and get off center)
Can u plz buy white popsockets and customize them 🥺
Do you shop at the thrift store
Anyone read the discription and saw the pisode nested of episode?
I want gum now XD
U should put pom poms in it
You know how she was banned from using strawberry and watermelon themes for a few months, we should ban her of using rainbow themes i think its an addiction now Lol like if you agree
you've done a lot of rainbow things...
I haven't finished watching the video yet but what you could have done is in all the spaces you could have put one of your oc`s like pickle.. Just a idea. What I mean by the spaces is the square things between each crevice, so like the smooth blank areas, Love your video  From, Kennadi
😍
Moriah: rainbows, candy, cute animals and creaturs nerdecafters: dark, scary, dragons        there great friends
Moriah takes so long on her art work yet she has less likes then charli damilio, like bro, Moriah deserves way more like if you agree
Can u make a another makeover of this
Very special tool yes
You should paint on glass I think that would be so cool
Probably cause you’re sooooo interesting
For some reason I scream the name of your characters whenever I see them
I have that same exact gumball machine
the gesso is the “ never ending GESSOO AHHH AHH AHH”
White paint: time to apply me to the gum ball machine! Gesso: NU I’m the one that gets applied Moriah: EH EH EH EH THERE BOTH WHITE PAINT -SCREAMS-
She loves her rainbows
You forgot the eyes on the scared chicken
moriah when she has to draw landscapes : im so bad and landscapes !? . me : look at mine before you call yourself bad

Moriah: that just *looked* like a screeching sound   Me: can you see a sound??
It's been marinating in my MiNd-
Whenever she said meat I was like tenderizer
NOTE: I think every Friday she should she should use her background color in the order of the rainbow. Just thought It would be cool
"Done all the steps!" "User: ciiiiciiii" "Good Luck everybody <3 "
10:17 why dose she sound like Steven universe OMG YESSS
It’s soooo cute!!!
12:32 you need new frames to analyze...

🎶 It's the gesso that never ends🎶  🎶Yes it goes on and on my friends🎶 🎶Moriah started using it not knowing what it was🎶 🎶And she'll continue using it forever just because🎶🔄

The ice smore nut cat looks like a cat candy Princess
Hi Moriah, There’s this person who is reposting your YouTube videos. Their channel is Moriah Elizabeth ME. Copy and Paste to let her know please.
U should of got a tripod
Moriah: am using a very specialised tool don't ask about it
0:35 are you okay?
Congratulations on 6.12 million!
You can soak the little plastic flap on the thing in hydrogen peroxide to make it clear again, thought you might like that
I think u should had painted the hole of the bubble gum
I think you should paint on a GIANT PENCIL ORRRR SMALL PENCILS, it’ll be interesting 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Bubble gum is expensive and your bubble gum machine looks so nice
Now I want bubble gum
Omg I LOVE IT!!!!!
This God was posted on my birthday January 22
Someone: Moriah, what do I name my cat? Moriah: MMmMm CupCaT
Moriah: “gooey price stickers should be illegal.” “NO ONE LIKES U”

Moriah: “I ordered 7 packs of bubble gum-“ Me: “Am I the only that see’s eight-?       Oh- only me? Ok-“
Hey Moriah i have an idea so it can fastly be empty, use it for halloween if you want to.
Poor Moriah at 0:36 and it was funny.
Nelson I understand u.....
i love you so much

me : *laugh* so hard that I fell off my chair me: hahaha!!- my siblings: are you ok? me: nOoOoOo- my siblings: ok???
Can you please   Send Me  Ice Cream 🍦 Squashes
This is so goood edit: yea idk why I am commenting rn i should of did this 3 weeks ago.
Nelson is now one of my fav ME characters (although I like them all)
😍🥰😌🤪
Can we all just apreciate the fact she spent more than 140 dollars 134 for the bubble gum 6 for the machine and then the poscas which are like 50 arent included
YOUR POOR!
Well she should wipe it down cuz of corona XD
My name is Lucy to
HEY! I LOVE RAINBOWS, BUT YOU SAID NO RAINBOWS IN THE NEXT EPISODE.  Am I right? :\
Am I the only one who notices that she forgot about PICKLE??
Oh my gosh my names lucie how epic😁
This sounds really weird, but I really think that bubble gum machine would be awesome as like merch or something🙃🤔
Why do you keep on showing ur creepy cupcake self p.s I watched that vid
Know I want gum :/
Price sticker- my life is great everyone loves me I tell people how much the item I'm on is  Moriah- NOBODY LIKES YOU  Price sticker- why   •~•
You helped me cure my insomnia thank you
The bubble gum Machine is 👌
I have the “rare thing”
I have the same gum ball machine and it is not as regular as you would think it is because if you want you do not even have to use a quarter,  the gum ball machine can be on a free mode and you can get him for free from a gum ball machine!😀
Georgie 🐓
u should go a step farther
Hi where do you get your sticker paper also love your work its always amazing
Anybody else here time traveled from 2034 when Russia invented time travel and didn’t tell the states
She was so icsided to paint this and the she gets so frustrated
That thingy she was talking about is a clip
This is a aggressive demand I am putting on every single video until you do it, take your absolute favotire characters and paint one on each SIDE not cube of a rubik's cube please.
Sus
She was real sis in this video

You should do a baking video of the human cupcake squishy (not cupie btw)   Please like and repost if you want lol see this happen 😊

The dislikes are the people who watched ur last vidio when you said you were done with rainbows. But I liked bc I realised that I'm done with rainbow part is NEVER going to happen. Also I like the gum
After a request or aggressive demand, let’s start another: “who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserves basic human respect” copy and paste if you agree 💖
You should give each color an outline of like white or that color but darker (you probably won’t see this tho🗿)
She named something after me
6:39
your so pretty and talented 🤍❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
Yay free dead skin cells XD
i love you
man i havent watched you in awhile. last time i saw one of the thrift store videos, it was 3#
I love your videos!🥰
U need a collection of gumball machines 🟠🟡🟢🟣🔴🔵
That video probably took sooooooooooooo long to make
The thing I love about Moriah is that she makes her own memes and are way more funnier then the other memes
One of the characters isn’t interacting with a piece of bubblegum
Omgggg i love yiu youre soooo funny hahaaa Me when i watch you:Hhhahahahahahahajjeqwxebqhd njqdw My dad looking at me be like: what the hell is she doin......
The languid quality neurophysiologically balance because card biosynthetically inform sans a descriptive gemini. gaudy, sore report
And Moriah you draw so good like i wish
Hey I'll come to get some bubblegum and i wont be bringing any money because I want 3 pieces :D
I have that gumball meshoien
hello I love your videos
A bunch of dead skin cells for FREEEE -Moriah 2021
You should have a rainbow song
I'm amazed
I'm  not interested  by her videos
All the makeovers  she does  are all  pastel and rainbow  and like it alot  but I think she should do something  different
I see Georgie in the comments you see it?
I think it's time for a new intro
everyone that wants to say to that the order of the colors was rainbow but doesn’t want to say it because they know people will get triggered*
Jk
I got cousin derp for Valentine’s Day and I’m so happy
Hiiiiiiii
Call the sloth sorasabi
this is so gorgeous
If it was me I would make it a bear with a face on the middle but and get some little ears
Rainbow ofc! 🙄🤚
13:13 the pink and green bubble gum match her pink and green nails
I think she needs to do a squishy coloring book of her squishy's please copy if you like
1 million rainbows later cuz she painted the bubble gum machine rainbow
after a request or aggressive demand, let’s start another: “who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserves basic human respect

No one: Not a single soul: Moriah: LetS pAinT a GumBalL MacHinE heHEHEhEhEHehEheE
her: "tInY bubble gum machine" me: yeah its so tiny it about the size of her upper BODY lmao you are so funny I love youuu
Your drowing is so cool  ¡
CAN PLEASE HAVE SOME PUMPY THE PUPKIN MERCH?
For the bubble gum why don’t you get some big balls that can fit and paint or print a character on it so you have a working character design
Make a fluffy slime
Hello
Hey moriah, Ive heard alot the resign you use can be dangerous for your health, it can be very dangerous for your lungs and give you llergy it's better to use it wearing a mask and doing it outside, thanks
can you plz make a deku squishy  (MHA) Izuku Medoriya
This bubble gum machine is the cutest💕
ew
Me: refreshing the page and waiting for her to hit 6 million
who else enjoyed hearing her sing "Its the gesso that never ends."
After a request or aggressive demand, let's start another: "who wants her to be well rested because she provided content for us every week and deserves basic human respect" copy and paste if you agree
I think moriah should of outlined all the characters in white instead of black so then the charecters would pop out (just a thought)
the red makes the rainbow complete
if you go inside the machine you can change the size of the dispenser hole, it will correct the number that comes out. Trust me, I had to 3d print one from scratch, model it and everything
You atoly got 8
Someone: whats your favorite color Moriah:Yes
it only gives out more because you got smaller peaces
Yay thrift store!
#Iloveme
Get a sponge
I love her talent she is soo talented
This reminds me of troom troom... But it's not stupid like troom troom.
that machine wigiddy wack
Moriah:one peace Me:are you weeb or I am dreaminh
I call the owl Berthold
Why did she call it bubblegum machine instead of gum ball machine?
Nelson looks like a nerd named Melvin
3:21 YES IT GOES ON AND ON MY FREINDSSSSSSS
Hi, I love your videos!!
Part 2 of asking you to make a reacicting to your oldes videos series
I love how you say “WHACK” in almost all of your videos 😂
WOW 🤩 edit: you’re very pretty Moriah
after a request or aggressive demand, let’s start another: “who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserves basic human respect” copy and paste if you agree
You have a ton of pineapple squishies, maybe you could paint them as georgies family.....or georgie in different costumes/attire if you franken-mix them with some other squishies :)
I have a demand I shall copy and paist dis and I want other people to do it with me here it is " TAKE A BREAK YOU WORK TO HARD ALL WEEK  <3"
OkiAnimeʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ is Original commenter Imagine if Moriah painted a massive wall mural of all of her characters
U r amazing Moriah also I agree when in doubt paska paint pens!!!
The second she said “you can see my reflection in the glass” it was lit the only thing I could think about! 🤣😂🤣😂
I want PPIICCKKLLEE
I didn’t get back your money from The gum bum machine:)
You've look so                 Beautiful in this video 😊💕
every friday is like a birthday for me! bc I get to see Moriah
Moriah: Yes, 2 and a half that means I have 5 and a half left. Me being good at math: ARE YOU SIRIUS? ITS 4 AND A HALF LEFT
People that skip the intro are like she just puts the same person for memes when is she gonna do a face reaveal
Is it sad that I’m obsessed with Miriam but I would’ve done WHITE with GOLD and GREY starts
The ice s’more nut cat was my favourite and when Moriah said her name was Lucy I was 🤩🤩🤩
I love georgie and pickle and derp, but I'm so glad you mixed up the characters!!
hey i still love rainbow but can you please just do something diffrent? im sorry if i spelled any thing wrong i dont know much inglish ;-;
Happy Valentine's DAY!!!
You are so cool. Your art is amazing I have watch all your videos because they are so funny. Love all of squishes!
well guys, she will be blowing bubbles for ages
"And an abundance of dead skin cells" Not even a single soul:    Shigraki used to own that then I guess.
Oml congrats on 6 mil yay u deserved it :) ur amazing ily ♡♡♡
Can you do a part 10 11 12 and that all upto 100😊
I really like your sweater it’s so colorful like you!
also rosie doesn't have anything to do with gum so ...
Why didnt u use like instruction paper or something for the dispenser then just paint? U can reform the dispenser and cover up the red? But this isnt my idea and I would have failed a long time ago with ideas for a bubble gum machine make over.
Window colour might have worked on that glass, however it's fairly easy to take off.
Your a master piece
When in doubt Poscas out
It’s actually kinda good that it doesn’t need money because since it’s just in her house she probably wouldn’t be looking for money every time
Does she realise we actually like the background changes ? orrrrrrrr
Did she just call the bubble gum machine “mini” ?💔🔨
i sooo want to eat that bubble gum
me: **reads description** description: "Hey guys! Today is another *pisode* from my series Thrift Store Makeovers,"
I think Lucy is more of a Jenny or milly
3:11 sanity left the chat
1:11 she gets a free GROSS offer
who else shivered when she scratched the geso
Posca pens double as window pens.  My mom paints the windows in the hospital for the patients and she uses them.
GESSO
That looks so good omg I could never do that
I could never 😜
I love your art 😍😍😍😍😍
please nema it susy my name is susy
I love it so much 🙃 it is so good
If you think the end is good *copy & paste if yes*
She makes every thing so pretty

U are the best artist on YouTube
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's squishy design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn’t fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy‘s and merch.  Let’s try and get Moriah to see this comment.
I’m OBSESSED with this! I’ve always thought a bubble gum machine would go so well in your room. This is amazing
in the music it says owa owa ow owa owa ow and like that has any of you heared that?

I really really like it!
“Wow”
I have a idea for a video you could make and paint ya own little dollhouse store make it out of wood maybe
That looks super cute
I love the revamp so much. Makes me want to get one and do it up myself XD
Can you react to your old video of the princess cupcakes thank you
tbh if your like having trouble picking a color for whatever your paint or drawing you can go back to the bubble gum machine and i guess it can pick a color for you :P
is it ok that I am a boy and I watch you
Me: rageing because you did not paint the gum hole......
Literally awesome people who dislike a just jealous
Who else loves how we randomly get clips from other vids?
I love your video and I love your work
She’s lucky she has creativity and doesn’t have to go out durning this pandemic to have fun😊
ctrl c & v This comment, Moriah plz do another Plushie Makeover.
Moriah should do a “painting a Rubik’s cube” video where she paints characters on each side copy paste so she could see this   (Credits to the original creator of this Idea)  250
I think she should pain her desk.
maby you can do another things to paint or do when your bord because i know i am!!!!
why doesn't she like her own amazing craft

Paint on rubber ducks :)
Your voice is so cute moriah!
That's what I was thinking I was thinking you know the characters have they have their own bubble of colors I feel like those colors meant that characters bubble that they're holding or something like that I love the design though
RUBBBBBBERRRR DUCKS!!!
I love you moriah I watch you evry time and I do drawings when I feel all jumpy because that's when I get ideas to draw 👩🏾‍🎨😁
Make a squishy Opie
Did I really just notice that moriah is left handed
Cousin Dirp would've looked good eating a gumball
I love Painting
You inspired me to make my own channels of painting Go to my channel Harper Hatfield
Oh no
13:14 these 2 kinda match her nail polish colors

4 and a half bags left :> not 5 and a half
am i the only one that doesn’t even notice when the background color changes ☠️
Moriah really likes rainbow huh 🤔🤨🏳️‍🌈
Not to be homophobic or rude to moriah or anything but she made rainbow so much that it kinda annoys me
i think she could put her pins in there like the the Georgie pin and cousin derp and pickle and she can basically put anything small and reasonable
Hey 👋 just an idea you can do a give away with some merchandise and you can give them bubblegum in the package 📦 just an idea though
And Moriah can vlog some times too??  and also test out some hacks in the internet  some video  ideas!!
pleas play some roblox in one video
OMG moriah did you throw one of your arts because I found maybe one of your creations and it has the me sign,I found it in a dumpster wait am i your neighbor 😱😱😱

Moriah-ok no more backgrounds       Me-you are a background
Moriah: Oh, hey, how you doin' Duck: AAH! Me: *Wheeze of Nostalgia *

Moriah: says that she draws so badly Me: Tries to draw a stick man, then notices that I can barely draw a line My sister: What in the world is that and why does it look so ugly?  My Brother: "Good job! It's starting to look like you." My mind: Moriah just doesn't want me to feel bad.     Moriah's fans: "Moriah draws so nice" Me: "I know, I wish she was my art teacher. My art teacher taught me wrong" My art teacher saw this comment.........Then she failed me the next day.
I've been watching you for a long time now. but I'm not sure if I've ever seen you paint a giraffe. I think it would have been cool! so can you plz make a giraffe? love you you are so creative and it's sick comfortable to watch! hao you can read this comment!

The flying chicken looks like it’s popping a bubble

Make a flip book
Moriah could you paint your squisy bin? since you have painted squishys
after a request or aggressive demand, let’s start another: “who wants her to be well rested because she provides content to us every week and deserves basic human respect” copy and paste if you agree
You all way make me happy when am down 😊

She reminds me of Billie Eilish their so original and laughs at their own jokes lol
I HAVE THAT EXACT SAME GUMBALL MAHINE I GOT IT FOR CHRISMAS
WHY IS MORIAH SAYING OWWW FUNNY!!? I'M SORRY FOR LAUGHING, MORIAH!!! YOU'RE THE BEST YOUTUBE ARTIST I'VE EVER EVER EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!
I... FLIPPING WANT IT
“Painting On Rubber Ducks”
Tiktok
Moriah: my art is all ugly and bad  her fans: WDYM YOU R FREAKING AMAZING
I can’t believe you’re 26 you look 18
oh. my. god. my soul just left my body  *Lucy* and *Nelson*  ...those are my names, that scared the heck outta me
The dislikes on this video are the gooey price stickers
Am I the only one who wishes she would say how long it took her to make these
There is a website that if you enter the sides of your Rubiks into it it will give you the steps to solve it.
Sooo cute!!! I looooove it!
okay but since when was moriah worried about stuff chipping, moriah... r u ok today, like... r u feeling ok
I don't know how to do a bubble with gum
the fact that no one rly says much about moriahs creativity, honestly im scared
ok I know I'm like, a month late but does anyone else think she could have put the characters on sticker paper and made her life a bit easier?
Ok here me out I absolutely love it but you didn't paint the inside and I'm triggered
I can't be the only one hoping she would make it into a sprinkles dispenser right?
It gave you so many bubble gum pieces probably because you used the wrong size
Keep kitty's name's lucy please that's my name!
You guys you should go through like ones that are chipping should go through ones that are OK make a pile ones that are OK ones that need to get redone because they’re shipping or they’re old and ones that haven’t done in a band you get what I mean
YESSS FINALLY MORE
I love you're videos they are super funny some times
I love you!
Fun fact: If you put a piece of tape on a price sticker, leaving a small tab open so that you can grab it, you can grab the tape and rip it off, and the price sticker will come of the item with it.
I HAVE THIS GUMBALL MACHINE!! My brother gave it to me long time ago :D
You should try slime
love it😍
DO THAT WATER MELLON SQUISHY IN THE HOPELESS BIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  KEEP BOMING
Fun fact: my mom has that exact same bubblegum machine, and she fills it with tiny poop-shaped bouncy balls.

This looked so cute I loved it. I loved the pupkin.
You should customise plastic 'bubblegum' to into it! 🥰
I do not think that is mini haha I have s smaller one. Not trying to be mean
MORIAH, DONT FORGET THE RABBIT IN THE BASKET SQUISHY FOR THIS EASTERRRRRRR
I'm pretty sure that she got smaller than normal gumballs! I think bigger ones would have made it so that only one came out at a time
Make a Among Us nesting dolls
Moriah: don’t ask me about the tool it’s hard to explain you won’t get it Me: oH i KnOw A nAmE fOr It A pApErClIp (No hate)
Trust me, eight bags of gum wouldn't last me a month.
Moriah: "Gooey price stickers should be illegal, nobody likes you." Me: Tell me about it..

Who keeps seeing her candy crush ad EVERYWHERE on YouTube
I like how she uses her own memes
You are a good artist 👩‍🎨
when i was constipaided you gave me ceroge and I love your vids including yoyu :) hope you well
your intro is so cringe i love it
[Verse 1] We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy  [Pre-Chorus] I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  [Chorus] Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  [Verse 2] We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game, and we're gonna play it           this took me to long lolz
Guys, I really like the ideas being suggested in the comments but can we stop with the “copy and paste so she can see this”? It just pressures her to work even harder than she already does. If you have an idea, then you can just comment it and move on with your day. If you see a similar idea to one that you want, maybe like it so it maybe she could see it. I’m sure it’s annoying for Moriah to also see the same comment over and over again which gets in the way of other ideas/advice/praise.
I love this, so super cute! Very ME style.
You should paint on rubber duckieeeeeesss
will u do a 3 coler challenge
*Me watching art to make myself feel bad about my trying art*
Guys, i want you to rate moriahs vids from 1-100 and why  I rate 99 not 100 only cos she only posts every firday (i know it takes a long time to eddit i was kidding) she is definetly a 100 for me
Why does she keep adding the clips from when she turned into a cupcake WHYYYY
When she said "Did i think of that in the moment, NO of course not" WHY DID SHE SOUND LIKE EDD FROM ED,EDD, AND EDDY?

Lol I’m always amazed that she doesn’t wear gloves when handling some of these thrifting things when cleaning them 🤢
Scared Chicken needs a name....I'm calling him Edmund. Why? Cause he looks like an Edmund to me.
I Love you
I love your ideas you have literally the best ideas and painting!!!!!
Moriah: Changing back grounds again. UGH SO UNPROFESSIONAL >:[  Me: *Trying to create Just ONE DECENT VIDEO, AND FAILING HORRIBLY* Thats 1,000,0000 times more unprofessional.

REALLY A RAINBOW GUMBALL MACHINE CANT YOU DO A BABY BLUE AND BABY PURPLE BLEND                                                                                                                                                     sorry you can do it any way you want :)

Moriah,  I just wanna say that your my inspiration for my art! I love your videos so much! Your so talented and creative! Can you tell me your address so I can send a box of squishes?😍
Gurl, don't worry, I name all my inanimate objects. UwU  I even named my umbrella George-

Omg! I’ve been logged out of yt for aGEs and I was watching all of these with no way to like or anything! (I forgot my google acc) I missed these!!!!
anyone noticed Moriah has her own vids of herself that are like gifs? so she doesn't even need anything other ppl in her vid. soo cool
miriha(lets draw some animals) me:WHERES GEORGIE
You are so funny
I love how she makes memes of herself. They are really funny.😂😂🤣🤣
Her + @RobertIDK= endless amounts of laughter. seriously you guys should date
Omg Moriah, you should've made a new character with this and have the top thingy (top hat) be a hat and the bowl be a head and it could be a fancy cat or something. What you made is adorable!!
bubble gum machine?? XDXDXD what happened to gum balls? lol you're the best moriah
You should put mini squishys in it
Can I have da Bubble gum?😂
did u say it looks like a squeeky sound? xDD
all i gotta say is... benson
Is it just me or whenever moriah changes the background I never notice ;-;
Your so good at art I poor
She makes the best art she says shes litrally so bad at drawing GURL😭🤚
I have a jelly bean machine so it dispenses jelly beans
Moriah I bet you can not do a whole picture in black and white
down below
Me when she called the cat Lucy: 😳😱😆😆😆😆      BTW: my name is Lucy 😆
I didn't even notice that the background changed until she mentioned it.
Am I the only one that has watched all her videos already ;-;
If you put a penny in it it would still give you gum ball so you can put whatever coin in it
I have that exact bubble gum machine and it works we put M&Ms in it
I had a bubble gum thing just like this but then my om gave it away it is cool so see how much things can change when you paint them :)
Pls can you do a shout to the fattest cat in the world/ my cat
To the very special person who is reading this comment: I hope that you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy in this hard time!😊😊😊
I love the rainbow colours that she uses.
"But, then I noticed-"  Candy Crush ad: This is the ad that never ends~. 🎵
Did any of this happen to you? “then I realized-“ TURBOTAX FREE EDITION
Am I the only one who loves how Moriah puts her own memes in her videos? Like if you agree
I feel she doesn’t  make original characters or ideas nowadays
Can we all take a second to appreciate that Moriah spent over 100 dollars on gum....
Also love your videos they brighten my week.
I dont like it.. I LOVE IT! (This is a girl)
On Procreate you can color fill with dragging the color circle to the outlined area. Just a fun tip that is really helpful.
This is my 6th time watching this.
I love your vids
Those are worth so much money
Don't  ruin the gumball machine 😭
I didn’t realize she was left handed 😂🤣
Moriah do another fixing things I've ruined!

Whenever I here puffy paint or acrylic paint it reminds me of these videos lol!
Is it just me or when she scratched the Gesso it gave you goosebumps
I have the same one lol. Oh and im on my grandmas phone so yeah
NELSON HI
You should paint on a pop it
Moriah you have to do sea shell painting this year remember from 2019 to 2020 now 2021 I think it could be really cool
Anyone else here watching it again while waiting for her to upload today? No just me? Okay
Is it just me or does it sound like there's a hoover in the background of the voice over  Edit: no I found out later that it's just me
Moriah I got Pickle, Cousin Derp and the Hamburger plushies for my birthday and I love them! I also got the Georgie plushie for Christmas and he is sooo cute! You are the best at art and let no one tell you that you don't do good art BECAUSE YOU DO, and don't criticize yourself all the time, because there will probably be people in the comments that your art is amazing, and without it we wouldn't have beloved charcters like Georgie, Pickle, Cousin Derp, and Baby Hamster! Tysm for making my Friday every week the absolute best! Have a great day Moriah and whoever else is reading this.
Idk why Moriah reminds me of tate mcrae just her face far away :>
I'm so happy you decided to use pumpy for this  design he's so cute
at 0:48 it looks like the angry  red riding hood cat is part of the gum machine

I cant believe she has 6.1 million subscribers!!!! She has come so far!!!
13:13 gum matches nails
ART QUEEN :)
Why is she not poasting the video
please stop copy and pasting about the fact people are stealing her designs and selling it. She has already known this and addressed this since APRIL OF 2019. This is the video she addresses it, you can also access this video from her community tab if you scroll down quite a lot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVp8CKGU8EQ *Do NOT COPY AND PASTE THIS* its annoying and it fills up comments sections. If you want to do something, just like the comment so it reaches to the top of the comment section and people are aware of this.  Thank you for your time.
Can u plz release pickle plush plz...
Is it just me who wants to see Howard as a squishy maybe?
They need a good guitar in there: www.denmarkst.co.uk
DO A RUBIX CUBE
Can you please do another baking video?
I have that exact machine
Is no one else bothered by the fact that she kept calling it a bubble gum machine instead of a gumball machine
Moriah I love your nails are they in a order?🤔

Moriah should do a “painting a Rubik’s cube” video where she paints characters on each side copy paste so she could see this   (Credits to the original creator of this Idea)
I love it!!!

Soooooo cute and cool

l can’t wait for the new video ✨🤩😇💕😘🥰😍😍✨
Moriah please listen  i think a good video idea would be: decorating a really cute planet called                                                           Squishy Land! <3  I just really like the idea of a little room for all the decorated squishys, i think it would be so cute!! And for ones like, the girl who's face is demonic, there should be a night mare corner for the bad ones.
Make a video with Hannah again u know ur *twin* i just think that its cool
I wanted to ask you this question who is your husband

Where is SAM ???
so coollllllllllllllllllllll
to be perfectly honest, I am more nostalgic and that thing looks like it was great quality and old. I wouldn't have been able to paint on it! Maybe if you put a coat of thin white varnish over the top plate it would tie in with the rainbow pastel theme? but more importantly: DID YOU SPEND 160 Dollars ON GUM?!?!?!?!
Hey ,moriah has 6M subscribers now !! Wuhuu🤪🥳🥳
Idea for you do a challenge with small one section paint pots and whatever colours you get out of the gum ball machine is what colours you have to use for a drawing.
Moriah needs to remember the bunny squishy for Easter this year! Like so she can see this!!!!
Everything that you do is rainbow
i guess i can say im a true fan cause i bought her icecream pajamas and my mom pulled something out of the package and i saw sprinkles and i said "GIVE ME IT" to my mom and she looks at me like i was insane
Moriah works soooooo hard on her squishies and merch she deserves. To read this. Thank u for your videos M.E

Here I go trying to make the longest comment on YouTube. What shall I say first? I don’t know. Well for the next hour or so it’s just going to be me talking.  Most of the people probably already scrolled away by now, I am just going to say my life story. Once upon a time, I was born. Got my house remodeled when I was one. Right before I was born, my family moved into the house I used to live in. I went to a very nice school, and then on June 13, 2019, we moved to a new house. We stayed at the same school, but I missed my old house. I grew up, went to a very nice college, while I was in college, I got a job at target. I then moved into my dream house, which is where I discovered Maria Elizabeth, tell him that with her channel, got a dog, my dog died😢, moriah kept me going through all of that, and that’s where I am today. Since I’m done with my life story, I think I’m going to talk about something else. What about what I’m doing right now? Right now I am lazily sitting on my couch watching this thrift store makeover video. Does anyone want to comment on this comment what they think the next video is going to be? I probably won’t have anyone say they think it’s going to be, because everyone has probably already scrolled away.

Hi Moriah I have been watching your Channel for a year now and this is my first comment I love all your vids especially ones like this(thrift store makeover)I wish I could get your merch but my mom won’t let me.(I know you probably won’t respond to this or acknowledge this but I love your vids)(and I am sorry about this weird looking profile pic my brother put it like this and I don’t know how to change it.)
I legit have THAT SAME GUMBALL MACHINE
I was just laughing at the whole entire video your so funny
Omg I have that gum ball thingy
can I get a shout out on your next video
Yay!I'm so happy she hit 6M subs on YT! Anyways I think she should do a unedited craft!
who else thinks that it would have been so funny if she made the sloth popping the bubble gum because he is not in the mood, so he is kinda ruining it, haha, no just me?
Happy 6M subs queen!!!
6MIL SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Spell check
Y do you all ways pick pink as red? but it does mack the srt cool!
who wants Moriah to paint on RUBBER DUCKS

Can I just say you inspired me to paint I am now 15 and a great artist! Trying to win the art competition
How fun! I'm  here because I saw you on Chloe Rose`s podcast. She's  so right! New subbie 😄
I have the same gum machine though for me its my skittles machine i got it at a car show

Moriah: omg this sucks how could I create this!???this is a bad representation of my Chanel   Me:struggles to try and draw a straight line Sniffles a bit
...               *BKAW!!!!*
Who else thinks she should do a house tour
I love how Moriah uses herself instead of funny gifs off the internet or something, I don’t I just find it funny
Genie: you have 3 wishes, choose wisely Moriah: I want....                    *The Gesso that never endsssss*
Hello! You should paint on a Rubik's Cube! Each side can have a different character or whatever you want. I didnt copy and paste this but I believe the original comment was made by @Pickle the Cutest Dinosaur
HAPPY 6 MILLION!
I need your address so I can send one of my Squishies
LETS GOOOOOOO  MORIAH GOT TO 6 MIL LETS GET HER TO 10 MIL SHE DESERVES IT
I think she should create something with the bubble gum comment and like who is agreed with me
Hey. Can you try this idea. So if you can. Can you paint a white Curtin and make it like a design that YOU really want to do. Love you ❤
Did anyone else think that the "bubblegum" on the  gumball machine looked like earwax?        no just me? ok..
Moriah should make a video on customizing a Rubik’s cube (copy paste so she’ll see)
I think it is earwax and this is my dads phone
hi moriah..can you pls do some diamond painting???plsss.

I know what you can do with that gum ball machine! Write some colors down on multiple pieces of paper and then put a coin in and then you should do like a three color challenge and whenever you turn the knob it will take out a color, and then the first 3 colors you can do a drawing with those colors  I love your are btw! ❤️ can I please have a shout out🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰 I followed and liked! Your not going to see this but I love your videos🥰 good night !😴

Hello I know this is weird to ask Moriah but how do you come up with your ideas for painting thing like this.
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Copy and paste let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.)
I really had to get on here to say that my daughters and I enjoy all your videos! They're part of our bonding time! We have a busy life and so we look forward to getting together and watching your videos. I even use it as a peacemaker when we get into each others nerves. Keep being you. No matter how bad you think ur videos or art are, we love them all!

6M!!!!!!!! Good job
congratulations for 6 million subscribers 👏👏👏
Since everyone is commenting this, PLEASE DON'T COPY the comments that say that someone is reselling her items. Here is the proof: https://youtu.be/rVp8CKGU8EQ , Moriah Elizabeth already was aware about it on April 2019 so there's no point in copy and pasting the comment everytime. It just ruins the comment section. Please be aware that you don't have to copy the comment, I just wanted to let you know about it.
Love your drawing
Congratulations on 6M subscribers, ME (Moriah Elizabeth) 😃🥳🎉🎊  I know this was unexpected :)
Sorry I didn't mean to unlike the video I wanted to like the video sorry

Hi moriah i am watching you for about 4 years now!!!🇧🇩and i am from Bangladesh
I think we all know that there is a seller on amazon, which is why you don't have to copy and paste it. Moriah knows, as she said on the community page, she knows about the seller. It is awfully kind that you are concerned, but cam you STOP copy and pasting it? It fills up the comment spaces, and it unnecessary. Please can you copy and paste this, so people can see it, and spread the word that Moriah knows.   Also, can you give me credit? Please like this comment so it goes further up the comment list, so more people can see this. thank you, bye

CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION! 🥳
YAYYY 6M SUBSSS!!!!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
(sigh) I wish I could have that much energy x)
Moriah should do a “Painting a Rubik’s cube” Video where she paints characters on each side copy and paste to make this happen
Wow

Now she has a life-time supply of bubble gum  Congrats 👏🏻

Not trying to be rude or is the bubble gum small or your hands big LOL 😂
oh my gosh she has 6m subs
I love that’s no one realizes that her reflection is in the glass UNTIL she points it out
Moriah: this is where I’m gonna do the *meat* of the artwork  Ad: *veggie* sausage patties!!

YOU HIT 6 MILLION
Omg 6M subscribersssssssss!!! 😱😂🎉
Me:*watching Moriah* *Gets an ad* *Sees Moriah in the ad* Me: :0
Well, they could technically be people. You don't have to be human to be a person. A human is a homosapien, and a person is a creature that is self aware.  I mean, I think of all my characters as people... Even if they only exist in my head, lol
U REACHED 6MILL
i love how she points out flaws that annoy her that we probably would have noticed till she points it out
Omg you got 6 million subscribers o:
Paint a Rubiks cube
What type of varnish do you'd use?

Hey if your painting on glass like that again a tip for the paint varnish don't use a paint brush use a cottan ball it shows no paint Strokes
When Moriah said she was changing the background  Me:*doesn’t even sees* -_-
Moriah: *makes a joke*  Me: HAHAHAHA that was funny Everyone else: ...
She's so close to 6 mil subscribers !!
someone should make a compilation of all the times moriah redecorated something with a rainbow theme.    if it's less than 20 minutes i would be extremely astonished.
I think it would be funny if you pull a prank on Jordan
moriah: this is a little and mini bubblegum machine. me: *notices how big it is compared to moriahs arm*  also me: .-.
Can you make a nother baking video pleas and thank you, your  awesome😄😄
Hi I’m lot

Have yall seen her first vid i think ima die 👁️👄👁️
Does anyone else think Moriah looks a little like Miranda Sings? If so please like this comment so I know I'm not the only one.
She's obsessed with rainbow
Moriah I love u so much but you really should have painted the inside but white ( as u was typing u explain why u didn’t do it 😂)
Very rare tool I definitely don’t have one
It is a gun ball masheen
I had the exact same machine as a kid (I would love to paint that now, sadly I don't have it anymore) and the bubble gum that came in the inside when I bought it was twice bigger than those, so that's why you're getting 2 to 3 gums per penny hahahahaha anyways I loved it!!!!

It is Gumball not bubblegum
Could you do another create this book video?
Moriah I love you but please can you please do something different from rainbow. You can just draw so well and I think you need to be more diverse
i lov art
OMG I love you!!! I was sad and I went to this video and I just smiled and laughed. I love your own sound effects and your memes of yourself
Moriah should do a draw my life!!! Copy link if you agree        PS. we are big fans uwu
You could’ve put puffy paint in the cracks
This is how many people want to meet moriah 👇
Ill be honest. Watching this I was like," oh no she's back with the rainbow" but then you came in with the characters and they added a lot of charm. I love it!
Idk but I have 1 squishy and um I don’t think moriah has it or knows it feel me dose she have a squishy that’s like a peanut butter jar
i wasn't surprised about the "random colors" actually being rainbow
I was weary at first because I love the original one but yours is beautiful!   Oh I don’t mean it in a bad way btw because you’re very talented and I love everything you do.
Moriah: *Not Liking Her Art(  Me: “That’s Better Than Picasso’s Art”
Moriah me and my friend were wondering what your address is because we have a ton of stuff to mail to you.
Do you know what gravity falls is.
Every Friday seems special because moriah posts some thing and she's unique she is one of my favourite youtubers because she's the best I luv her characters like georgie the duck because it reminds me of chica  please do more videos.
Amazing work with the bubble gum machine! It looks heaps cuter than before! 😍

I had a gumball machine that was nearly identical to this as a kid. Mine was pink. It had a special key for the top
Moriah plz look at my YouTube channel it is called magical unicorn toys and more plz
Fine outside crazy on the inside

you should paint like, marbles or some sort of ball shaped things? lol and then add then onto the collection inside your bubblegum machine
I vote for the next squishy video you should do the cute little hedgehog with sun glasses and you should pant the clutch/purse/wallet with a panda on it as you said. Plus Mickey Mouse cupcake and panda holding a cake!
She should of put a red piece of popped bubble around the opening to blend it in to solve both problems of her issues how the opening looks and how wanted to put a piece of popped bubble gum
today is my birthday
OMG PUT MINI SQUISHIES YOU CUSTOMISED IN THE BUBBLEGUM MACHINE :OOO
Just enjoying another Friday of Moriah’s painting and then I look away from my phone AND EVERYTHING IS GREEN. AAAH-
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL, I have watched ALL of your videos and I think you are hilarious and a HUGE Ro model P.S. My real name is Lauren and I am a kid
Cute idea but way too much drama...it cheapened the presentation.
PLEASE MAKE A SQUISHY OF OPIE
That is adorable
OMG how long do you edit
you are the best youtuber in the world and your artwork is amazing,its better than mine witch  mine is bad
Did anyone else pre order a pickle plush?????
Q&A: are you an introvert or an extrovert Are you left handed? If you had to burn one squishy, which would it be? Love yer videos! (Like if you also want these questions to be answered)
She named the cat after me 🥺
Maybe you can make lil squishy bubblegums
this is not a rainbow item its just a pretty assortment of colors that suspiciously looks like a rainbow
Can you please try an edgy style or like sporty  for any style of vid
Moriah: "This is gonna where I-" *Cut off by Grammarly add* Grammarly: "Switch to grammarly" Me: *Facepalm* "Why, grammarly, why?"

who else is now craving gumballs
who else was surprised when she made the bubble gums rainbow order but thought "I knew that"
Hello Moriah, my name is Bella and I have been watching your videos for as long as I can remember. When you posted this video it was my birthday but I went on a trip for my birthday and didn’t come back until today and that is when I am watching. I would just like to say thank you for making these enjoyable videos. I watched your videos when I was younger but then I stopped. Just this past summer my parents got divorced and it was really tough but then I found your channel again and watched ever since. It cheered me up during the days that were bad and made my day even better during the days that were great. I really hope you read this comment and know how amazing you are and how much more people you have made happy. Thank you for everything. -your loyal fan Bella💕

There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her the credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishys and merch. Let's try to get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you (all credit goes to Charlie dog the original commenter.)
Make a deck of card series where each card has a different character of yours
The random music that popped in when she was painting the bottom startled me.

You should make a board sloth plushy
Like my sentence if: You think there should be more videos like this..!!
You should make a video of you painting all of your unicorn squishes.

Ngl... I jumped back when her face popped in the gesso💀

I really appriciate you, even tho you may never see this I want you to know that I love you and your art, keep going and I'll be here through out the journey.  Much love and appreciation. -Just one of your millions of Subscribers.

Put mini squishies in it and turn it to find out which squishy to decorate!
Petition for goey price stickers to be illegal🤣
What are the containers with the latch lids and 6 compartments called that she uses for her paint storage?
1:59 to all the haters
She didn't give Rosie the bubble gum!!!
How I found your channel  My friend gave out cheep squishies at her birthday party. I didn't like mine so looked on the internet to see how I could paint it then I found moriah I watched a video as a tutorial then got stuck in the moriah loop
*Me seeing the thumbnail* Me: let me guess she is gonna make the gumball machine
How old is opie
Moriah is so talented!! Also the fact that she doesn't let the haters hurt her. I hope you have a great day god bless!!
does anyone else think moriah should've used a different color for pumpkin puppy's bubblegum instead of orange so he looked like he wasn't still a pumpkin? (not to hate or anything, i love her vids!)
what is that on 12:32 🥲lmao anyways love u moriah!

I was not surprised when she painted a RAINBOW on the bubble gum machine.
Ok ok ok. At 13:13 the nails of her fingers holding the bubblegum MATCH the bubblegum perfectly... I love it
Surprised you didn’t use pom-poms
Ok sense you have all those bags of bubble gum can you just ship ALL THE BUBBLE GUM TO MEEEEEEE
You should buy a cheap makeup sponge packet and blend with that, just line it with the two colors, not blended on the sponge, and then dab it on the surface
I love your creation and you're all your videos and make my Fridays better and Mondays because sometimes I miss out on them thx so much.

0:23   I’m not the only one who thought that it was going to turn into a jojo reference right-
LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
This is so cute. I've always wanted to get a gumball machine and basically use it as a piggy bank. Lol.   But my girl. I'm by no means a professional but let me give you some tips I learned from painting super random crap my whole life. Painting Glass with Something not Meant to Paint Glass: you really want to go with acrylics here. *Very* lightly scuff up the glass with as fine of sand paper you can get your hands on. You don't need it all scratched to hell, but just light enough to give the paint something to hug. Also only scuff up where you want your art to be. You can do this by lightly tracing/sketching your art with a wet watercolor pencil or fine no pasca and scuffing up the glass inside your lines. wipe it clean with alcohol. You super want to make sure there are zero oils from your hands on the glass and no dust from scuffing the glass. Then add your paint. Use thin layers to minimize brush strokes. Once your first layer is dry, *gently* rub your work with a dry paper towel! I've found that paper towels are ever so slightly abrasive and have helped to minimize brush strokes in glass, porcelain and resin(bjds♥️) really well. So between each layer of paint, give it a healthy but gentle rub down with the paper towel. When using a brush you won't/shouldn't need to seal between layers. Paper towel sanding will work with your clear coat too: use very very thin layers and rub it down *while dry* between layers. You don't want to touch wet sealant with a paper towel, you WILL cry. Try to not get too much sealant outside of your drawing unless you are using a spray (you won't need to worry about brush strokes with a spray on sealant so you won't need to rub down with a towel unless you get a little heavy handed and end up with drips.) If you spray the whole glass, you won't need to rub it down. If you only spray the paintings, just rub down the edges really well to help blend them out. Same with a brush on sealant: scrub the edges with a dry paper towel to help blend them out. You already seem to have done a fantastic job cleaning up the edges, I just left that bit for anyone else who wants to paint glass too :3
That is so me 😶 Btw luv moriahs vids!  I am like her.
" Guey prize stickers should be illegal, *nobody likes you* "  Oh moriah is bullying the stickers send help xD
OMG!!!! you almost hit 6 million subscribers!!!!! Edit: Yay!!!!! Congratulations Moriah for reaching 6 Million subscribers!!! I've watched your videos for a very long time!!!!🥳🥳🎉🎊.....you should celebrate by doing weird and fun videos!!!!     Wish you could reply😁

I luagh what she is doing
Omg u made it so cool WwwooowwW✨
Tell me what your favorite Squishy that Moriah EVER did😃
Nelson looks like he farted in church..  Hey!  . . . . Did you know that there is someone who loves you unconditionally? Someone who loves you more than anyone on Earth? Well, he does. Jesus does. He loves *YOU* so much that he came while you were a sinner - not after you cleaned up your act - and died for you. He shed his blood for you, becoming the perfect sacrifice for all of time. He rose on the third day, ensuring victory over death, hell and the grave. He told the devil that he was defeated _TO HIS FACE_ and that is why there is so much evil raging in this world right now. Satan wants to steal as many people as he can from God, trapping them in eternal damnation. BUT - Jesus made a way when there was no way.   All you have to do to gain eternal life is: 1) Believe that Jesus came and died for you. 2) Accept him as your savior and confess out loud that he is your Savior. 3) Cast away the things of the world and live strictly for God. There is nothing that you could do that would separate you from the love of the Heavenly father... except live a life of sin. Sin in the only thing thing that keeps us from God because he, like Heaven, is perfect and sin is not welcome in his kingdom. Do you know what you're escaping when you commit to Jesus? You're escaping the eternal torment that you deserve as a sinner, but Jesus died as the perfect, sacrifice to take the burdens of your sins for you. You are escaping the constant reminders of what you did on Earth that you always put before seeking God. The torment.. the agony.. it goes on forever, night and day with no end and not rest. Think of sin like stains on your clothes. When we sin, a stain appears, but when you ask Jesus to forgive you, he switches clothes with you, so when you are looked at by God, all he sees is a spotless robe, on his beloved child.   How do you repent? Easy! You 1) Confess that you're a sinner, and because of that you need Jesus, and His Holy Spirit to guide you daily. 2) Turn away from sin and turn to the word of God. The unchanging, absolute truth that is basically a road-map to the King of Kings. Put your trust in the blood of Christ and you will be saved. Time is running short, you guys. The rapture is so close. Make the choice today... tomorrow is not guaranteed..

When you realise that Moriah bought $140 dollars worth of bubblegum-
Next thing on my strange addiction: Addicted to price tags
I'm reminding you to decorate your easter squishes at some point

I wanna see Moriah do something related to AMONG US!!!!!!!

Yes! I was crossing my fingers at the beginning of the episode hoping that Moriah was going to paint some of her characters on the glass part! <3
I have probably played this video 20 times in the past two days!!! 💖

Hey Moriah! I was wondering if u could maybe paint something with the bi flag? Ty and love u 💗💜💙

"There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.) Copy and paste this and comment it on her vids.
Hi Mariah I have  watched all of your squishie videos
Hi guys, I know it's too annoying whn ppl promote their channel in the comment section, but it would be really nice if u guys help and support my channel Random Rathore,..if u like the contents pls Subscribe,.  https://youtu.be/Ho6RdB4Xvek
1:55 immediately made me think of that Gus Johnson video about paper based sticker. anyone else?
For some reason my first thought was that she was going to fill it with a bunch of tiny squishies (for aesthetics) but actually putting gum balls in there makes much more sense lol
NELSON IS SO CUUUUUUUTTTTTTEEEEEEE!!!!! Nelson merch?
You're the best and I love you art😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You should try to find pastel bubble gum

You should sort the gu m in rainbow order so it's not as hectic
how come i saw you on a candy crush ad? 😂
I LOVE YOUR SOUND AFFECTS YOUR SO WEIRD AND I  LOVE IT PLEASE KEEP DOING SOUND EFFECTS!!!!! (your own sound affects)
I love that she talks to us as friends not just random people ❤️🤍❤️
Since the red is bothering you you could bait something on the lid of it so it covers most of it up
New viewers: why is shy so weird!   Me being a viewer since she first started: another video another crazy day with moriah
I have that same gum ball machine-
Benson (from the regular show) got a makeover
I have that same gumball machiene and now I wanna paint it lol  Moriah: *paints rainbow* " no particular order "  Moriah later: " wait I meant my random colors here heh heh "  Moriah later later: " okay so now itll match the rainbow "  Me: * thinks * "okie dokie!"
I just got put into quarantine, but your video made me feel better^-^
Can you make Georgie a sister Georgian
This is disturbing after seeing the regular show-
Paint all your popcorn squishy
You could put felt in the red spot.
Love it and love you mariah
Lol she litterly could make money from this
Real fans knew when pink was was on the top
So thats what you meant in the story- I thought you were painting gum i-
Idk if u know this or not Moriah but u make every day better when I watch ur videos and ur so creative and good at art! ❤️❤️
This was such a cute makeover. Really enjoyed it😊😊. Enjoying all your videos anyway
I won that gum ball machine at school for the most box tops 😂
3:21 😝
This video was amazing!

Who’s gonna introduce Mariah to 🙌🏻goo gone🙌🏻
Nelson stans unite :)
Omg I love the sweater ur wearing at the beginning of the vid!! So cute
I was watching this vid and an ad for candy crush start playing and moriah was in it for the longest time I thought it was a part of a vid for some reason
Moriah: painting How many rainbows moriah wants: YES
Uhhh Elizabeth those were 8 bags of bubble  gum 🤔
We haven't seen him in a while
Where is sam
I HAD THAT BUBBLE GUM MACHINE AND WE JUST GOT RID OF IT A LIKE A LAST YEAR AHHHHHHHH
YESSS ALMOST 6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS
You should paint your desk
I have that exact gumball machine...
Painting on rubber ducks next!!
I want you to send me the  baby penguin from the hopeless bin.
Idk bout you but i would put skittles or m&ms in there
I love it!
Not bubble gum it’s gum ball !!!!!!
each video  you will probably see the bubble gum getting smaller and smaller each video in the back round
U make me happy
PPlease do a unboxing video
i’m legit screaming! almost to 6 mil 🥺 i remember watching you even before 1 mil. you’ve come so far!
I always forget she posts on fridays😄 and then her video appears and I’m like 🥳🥳🥳
Ok, can we talk about her new sweater!? 👉👈 I’m jealous.
U should do a Dino mask
“That’s a dirty gum hole”- Moriah Elizabeth 2021
https://youtu.be/FMmq_bqc6zY  Lol, this is your first video XD
OMG the song that doesn't end reference is sending me baaaack!
You should do an among us theme
i always enjoy when she does rainbow designs because I always think      *gay* :>
I think your supposed to have bigger bubble gum in there that’s why it had multiple coming out at once idk tho it might be broke lmao
Paint the gum cover. That way you only see the red part when you take the gum out.  Maybe paint a popped bubble there over some matching background from the base of the machine?
Me: waiting for her video Why do I fell like Friday doesn't come fast enough?!
WHO IS GOING TO BE THE 6M FOLLOWER
I know this is thrift store, and I saw your pottery  video you didn’t really like it. And I didn’t like pottery either until I found clay! It’s like pottery but you have more boundaries, you can make more things then cups of bowls I think you would really like it. :> I wouldn’t suggest a kit if you go to hobby lobby they have air dry and bake they have packs of primary and other colors with institutional guides how to bake!
You should really  do 3 makeovers on the  category no saving squishes like plz that’s all I want you to do
Did you know that.....Read More
Its the gesso that never endssss!🤣
Her art:,♥️💖🌺🌷🌹💐🌸🏵️🌻🌼💮🌈🌆 My art:💩🖤👁️🗑️
"im scared of that hole" IM SCARED OR UR GESSO
You should put little squshies in it to inside of bubble gum
Wheres opie 🥺
Credits to *Katie* you should paint on rubber duckies! Im just spreading even more attention or trying to ^^
Hey Maria do you still post videos on Mondays
Am I the only one who wants her to do another “turning my squishy’s into food” video?
You should really make a husband for Rosie!!! Copy and paste this comment so she can see it!!!
I wish the gum ball machine was an actual product she made because I would buy it for sure
Omg u should fill it with a bunch of mochi squishes!!!
YALL SHE IS SO CLOSE TO 6 million
I need gum and a gum machine now-
Amazing talented 💓💕❤️
Lets see how many subscribers I could get through this?  𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 : 144
Me: *crys* I HAVE BRACES NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! ;^;
VIDEO IDEA: basically you show us the clean up after your done doing a squishy make over (i just wanna know how you get the paint off the brushes cus the paint always sticks to mine)
Hi Moriah, I love watching your videos. Can you do a video were we get to pick squishys
am i the only person who just realized that she’s left handed😂
Super creative! I especially love the characters drawn on the top of the gum ball machine. Me when I see depressed sloth: 🤠
She almost has 6 million subscribers!
jan 21st was my bday
You should do another create this book 2 episode this Friday🥺😁
Love the shirt where u get it from
Moria why are u in a candy crush ad i got
I just realized Moriah is left handed
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
Meriah u were kinda a negative Nancy in this vid...
It looks AMAZING  its so colour full!
I didn’t have a good day today but guess who helped it again?😀
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
On my screen it shows her subs as 5.99 million ( 5.99 ) add one right-?
But.... Why the gesso? Typically it’s for smoothing out rough surfaces, but in this case it just added visible brush lines onto an otherwise smooth surface? It just would’ve made more sense to use a spray-on primer...
You should pant a baby doll
Hi I just subscribe hope you enjoy 6 million subscribers
do another baking video
Copy and paste this if mariah should do another baking video:)
You should do diamond art u can get it if Amazon would love to see it like if u agree xx💕💞
It’d be so funny if Moriah tried to play roblox!
Can I please ask how she found that
Can we see more of Rosie she is my favorite
HOW DID O NOT KNOWN OF NELSON’S EXISTENCE😭?! Also, for the red area where the gum drops, you can got glue a piece of foam of a diff color
Since you have more bubble gum bags you can still use them when the bubble gum machine is low on bubble gum lol ( sorry if you already knew that)
Me:seeing the comments* oh wow When Moriah posts a vid: Subscribers:comments very fast* 1 to 20k to 22k ;-; in 1 hour
you know the things is coming to my  mind when I think about you is rainbow after squeechies
These makeovers are the best
Hold on am I the only one realizing I think she is left handed
You are so .. Like a kid
Who was also raised by Moriah??? 2014 :)
It’s weird but where is your brother .  :>
eeeee! i have the same gumball machince but it was like 34.99 BrUh
pickle
YOUR ALMOST AT 6 MIL AHHH
MORIAH CHECK UR MEMORY BC THIS WEEKS VID WAS SUPPOSED TO BE Q&A
Shes such a great artist
My friend at my school has your gorgie murch
She should've chosen the baby hamster and made the blanket a bubble gum popping
Moriah, you've inspired me to do art!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPCNAdg39jA
So Moriah are you what are you gonna make a Pickle the dinosaur purse 🤔
there's a brand on etsy called TrippyDraws that just released paint pens, they work really well on glass products and are similar to posca! (copy and paste this so Moriah can see this; original comment by _enbee artist_ !)
Hi, I was looking at YouTube and for some reason a lot of your old videos where popping up, and that gave me an idea... you should do a video on reacting to your old videos! I think that would be a good idea!!
5:15 that's what she said.
And this is where we're gonna have them meat the painting        A commercial right after that saying, this is Arby's and we always have the meat with some like ham sandwich        perfect just perfect
OMG FILL IT WITH A FEW MINI PAINTS AND DO A FIVE OR THREE COLOUR CHALLENGE
I personally loved the sound effects tbh 😁
Omg so close to 6M! Love you so much Moriah!
Hey Mariah I think I have a video idea ...you and Laurenzside  should do a collab together
Remember when her marker would just randomly explode ink? XD
Day one of asking her to design CDs
When she was painting the bubble gum dispenser she should have made it 3D with candy or bubble gum it would look cool :D but I still like the one right now tbh uwu.
You should fill it with sprinkles
Can you sell something like it I would by it it looks cool 😎😎😎😎
Hi Moriah, I just had an idea for another old thrift store makeover, A VIOLIN!!! It has so much painting space o the back! I really hope you like my idea. And can you pls give me a shoutout if you choose to use my idea. I love your videos so much and you always make to seem me smile with your weirdness and you are soo much fun!
7:11 when she named the cat Lucy I literally screamed cuz my cat’s name is lucy
please  make tiny simple squishies and put them in the bubble gum machine
I WISH I COULD LIKE THIS VIDEO 99,999 TIMES!!!
Has anyone ever been reading the comments while watching the video and everyone is commenting a quote that was said in the video and your just waiting for her to say it?
Do you know what a fairy is Because I am 1And also My hamster is a furry
Almost choked on soda while watching :)
Me wantz traze
Don't mention the background change! I don't notice it!

Could you try a 3d pen? I have one and i love it and i think you might too! (:
Moriah: How do I still have so much in this container when I use this ALL the time?  MaGiCaL gEsSo:?  Moriah: ItS tHe GeSsO tHaT nEvEr EnDs...  MaGiCaL gEsSo: :))

Omg listen to this please, hear me out, What if she painted gum balls with food markers a fill the gum ball machine, and she can paint the gum balls to look like character from squishy makeovers, example: GORGIE
Moriah used to be the only person I would watch, I decided to come back.
This is so clever. Well done Moriah😁😁😁
YOU SHOULD DO ONW WHERE YOU DO THE EXACT OPPISITE LIKE YOU USE POPSICLE STICKS OR DONT SAND IT OR LIKE ONE WHERE YOU DO IT HOW YOU USED TO DO SQUISHIES OMLLLLLLLLL

Number 45 on trendinggg
Eeeeeeeee Moriah’s at 5.99M subs! She’s almost at 6M!! I swear she gains 0.01 every day
It gives you more bubble gums because they are smaller you should have bigger bubble gums 🥰
YOUR NAILS ARE NOT IN RAINBOW ORDER!!!!!!!!
Why did as soon as I saw Moriah I immediately thought of Mariah Carey no LMAO
We should have a celebration when Moriah finishes the GESSO THAT NEVER ENDS.
If she were to paint the red she could use the clear varnish could seal it so then it wouldn’t ship
Who wants to see moriah make a tv show on Netflix?
MORIAH LOVE YOU! u make the world a better place! Plz pin me! I’ve never gotten pinned 🥺
Moriah your video’s make me happy each Friday ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖😍🤩💝💕😻😸👍
Me:waiting for her to be a 6M   Her: doesn’t even notice

Copy and paste this if you want her to paint rubber duckies
Copy and paste this if you want her to paint rubber duckies

You’re getting two at a time because your bubble gum is too small but it’s a great offer!!! 😆😆😆
Sometimes I. Wonder why she hasn’t posted them I remember she’s in America there’s a six hour difference 😒
Hi
If you have a cup can you make Cuphead squishy makeover or Mugman and if you don't know what it is then search it up or Bendy or one of the characters from bendy squishy makeover search it up too if you don't know it bye
Everyone: commenting random stuff Me: *New frames need analyzing. Click here to finish anylizing.*
It's funny that she talks to us like we're not some random strangers 😅
This turned out really wonderful! :)
does she ever look at the comments?
It's ok that you paint rainbows all the time there one of the only things that bring me joy in life.
So I might be the only one here that watches her but Moriah should collaborate with Brianna
It’s like biggy bank
Do ya realise there were 8 bags of gum not 7 ha
you should try the trend on tiktok where they paint on glass
Adorable!! I love the finished product so much!
I used to have one of these with the stand and everything. I kick myself for selling it in a garage sale!! Yours looks amazing! ❤️
Low key I feel scared please I beg you clean EVERY SINGLE INCH OF IT EVEN THE INSIDE
You need to bring back stuff to do when your bored
Today is my Birthday can i get a shout out in the next Video?
Ahh I’m a day late
omg wow you make it so cuteeee
i think moriah should paint rubber duck
I though of the SAME IDEA
You make me laugh so hard
Any support will be appreciated. Tiktok: @iam_mask_girl_101
I want it
I loved it
Moriah you're as old as my sister
You should Try Painting On CD’s!🤗💿
Wow this has to be one of the most colourful art pieces you've done! I love it so much! I wish I had the skills to make one! But I might one day because you've inspired me to create,what I ment to say before I went overboard love this weeks video and I  excited to see next week's
1.1k of these people dont know good content
Can I buy it off you for 80$ please
Fun fact she did not paint this on Friday 🤣
You could paint the glass part where you see the red so it wont chip but you cant see it
I know you’re doing a Q&A soon, and I have a question! How did you get into art, painting, and crafts? You’re so good and talented at arts and crafts!
“Roses are red” “Violets are blue” “Moriah is creative” “Amazing too”
1:55 I agree ☝️

Please review the cricket machine!!!
Moriah is about to hit 6mil!!!! :DD

Lol I love it
Thrift store makeover!  Yay!  I almost like these as much as squishy makeovers!
U have 5,99m subs and I subbed but it’s still on 5,99m
Moriah Elizabeth: Sticky stickers should be illegal NO-ONE LIKES YOU Me: Its just the facts
I think you should have done a fish bowl design on the glass instead   Also can you please do a blog channel? Like the daily life video
here at 5.99 million ❤️
She is so close to 6 million subs! 5.99M !!
Please bake
Omg what if she painted on PAINT BOTTLES? Like, not the container for the custom paint, but the paint tubes!
I had watched this when it was one minute ago but on a tv so I couldn't comment sad but I'm still okayly early sooo
Moriah should do a “Painting A Rubix Cube” video, where she paints one of her characters on each side, COPY AND PASTE THIS SO SHE SEES( original from The Seventh Queen)
Lamb chops
SHE FAILED TO SAY OWIE WHEN SHE HIT ELBOW
MORIAH YOU HAVE TO PAINT A RUBIX CUBE WITH A CUTE CHARACTER ON EACH SIDE
i absalootly love the finished product and yes i know i spelt it wrong
I would name the chocolate, rainbow, kitty Nasha, it seems like it fits her. But Lucy is great too!!
This is how much people would pay for this | | v
Please do a squishy makeover next
Almost 6 million!!🍃🌼
You are so good at designs I love your squishy makeovers the best your are definitely my fave ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 would be amazing if you did your squishy designs as giveaways sometimes or even have them on your shop ❣️

https://youtu.be/Ogq7d-30PBo
When are you going to do another create this book episode, I've been waiting to see another episode of it?
She needs to do create this book two so she can get it done in under three years she needs to get it done by November 14 for it to be under three years
Did anyone else notice she’s at 5.99 million subs?
Let’s get her to 6m your videos are amazing!
0.48 doesn’t the grumpy cherry berry bear look like it’s sitting on the gum ball machine
Mariah you should do a video where you paint something  that you usually don’t paint like with dark colors. You do not have to but I think it would be interesting.
10:18 Steven Universe slides in.. 😂😂😭
You should do a baking video love them.😍❤️❤️
When you finally say it’s not going to be rainbow and it actually doesn’t turn out being rainbow then my life would be coming to an end
Somewhat not at all related to the video but I started singing training wheels when she said “take off the training wheels”- uh don’t ask 🌝
right now only 1 number is left and she wil hit 6 million subscribers
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that 7-2.5 is 4.5. Not 5.5?? 🤣🤣 no hate. Love this channel
y'all idk what to comment ;--;, OH i just realized she is about to hit 6M!! congrats moriah :)
YOU FORGET to add the E in he description
ya'll remember that fat pig  that she opened  a few weeks ago? we forgot about that squishy!!
Great. Now I wan’t bubblegum
I love your channel 😁
My family has a bubble gum machine we've had it for a long long time and I know that cause it helped me get potty trained cause when ever I went potty on the toilet I got a piece of gum
Every time I come home from school on Friday I rush to my room to watch Moriah’s new video she makes my Friday so much better <3
For anyone who doesn’t want to see the nasty stuff here is a time stamp of where it ends 2:00
Ooo u could make a cat toy 🧸 LOL
I think she should paint face masks😷
You should do a video using a different style like emo YESSS
Hey Moriah Elizabeth my brother gave me an idea. He said to make a mini sweater for pickle the dinosaur and all of your plushies so they can have clothes to wear and dress up.
Moriah you should do shuishy makover! Pls moriha
Moriah you really don’t know how much I love you if I could send a package I would but I really can’t but this comment is the best I can do😁🥰
that looks suspiciously like my old gumball machine that i got tons of coins stuck in like my child and we had to sell when we moved. If so i will confirm that was a burger.
Uhhhh I hate Moriah like what's  with the rainbows and everything                                                Said no one ever
moriah u can cover the inside where the gum falls with theese sticky colorfull paper that are used to decorate everyday objects
I don’t know if this is just me but I am so triggered that she says bubblegum machine I think it’s a gumball machine LOL sorry
I didn't relize  this until now. She's left handed.
Everytime I see the sloth guy he reminds me of HISHE's version of the troll from frozen. Look it up and tell me I'm not crazy. Edit: I just looked it up myself and I think it's not so much the way the troll looks and more so that the sloth  looks like the way HISHE would animate (especially the face) and I can totally imagine the trolls voice coming out of him.
Are we not going to talk about how CLOSE she is to 6 million?1 She grew so fast and I honestly can't blame people for loving her! She is amazing!
Love the names and I love sloths 🦥
I always try to draw and paint like u but I just can't I love u Moriah and I watch every single video plus I have my own Chanel too pikolalasis if u wanna go have a look at it. cant weight till next week!!!
Hey Maria that part where the bubblegum comes out and it's red I it may be the red that you never do instead you do pink so now You can have a reason
“Every sticky price sticker should be illegal”  Me: ummmm YESSSS. YES YESSS    This  is an edit thank you for all the likes and comments ❤️😍😘
Great. Now I want one too😂
Lol I saw a little girl with ur merch in target today
I’m just looking at how many subscribers she has and I see that there is 99M subscribers and I’m like come on just one more subscriber and she has 100M subscribers
a little more subs to Moriah she will be in 6M subs!
Umm where does the money go
Yes
I love your squishy characters
Hey Moriah watch your "Fixing the Unfixable" Video and look at the video carefully I saw that there was a cup that was in better condition and the same cup as the one you used 😐 Anyways, I love your videos!🙂
i want you to fix the rubbr ducks
Súper specialized tool, very rare, don’t ask about it you wouldn’t understand
*its the gesso that never endss*  *Evil chuckle*    Everyone: **scared**
I think it would be really cool if you did a bob Ross tutorial on a squishy lol
she should try water marbling
I knew it was a gum ball machine from your post
b u t t e r    idk why i just wanted to say that sorry- XD
call the sloth sammy the sloth !

I love everything you paint on
«Yes am painting a gum machine»   Me: eating gum....
Her:and trying to do a thing- pampers are the best diapers ever   Me:are you kidding me!
All I saw was the price of that gum
I JUST REALIZED SHE WAS LEFT HANDED
Moriah: you can see my reflection in the glass  Me: oh yessss, if you would not of pointed that out I would not of noticed

MORIAH PLS BRING BACK GEORGIE I WANT HIM SO BAD PLS I BEG YOU!!🥺🥺
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ/╲/\╭(•‿•)╮/\╱\

Can you paint on your table (🌈)
Wait what this was uploaded yesterday? YouTube are you drunk? I didn't got any notifications 😭✋
Soooo cute 😘😘😘
Can you make the bored sloth squishy into a plushie
Who thinks that Morgan Elizabeth should paint something from every letter of the alphabet then she'll have 26 new items that she would have painted like it you have agree👇👍
Moriah Elizabeth should play among us 🌈🦎🐢🥳👩🏻‍🚀
Moriah you are the best artist I have ever seen I love all of your videos I watch them everyday and you are AMAZING!!! :)
When is the next vid
I LOVE YOU
It'll be fun if the machine is filled with spherical charms of her characters instead of gumballs, but it will take a long time to complete it.
It’s so hilarious how she uses past videos as memes 😂
For the Russell I literally screamed when I saw your face not trying to be rude
I love her characters she has created.
Carrot
me and my broter wher watching it today he laughed hardddddddd at the end
I dare you to make a pug a squishy pug
can you offer this chewing gum dispenser in your online shop ?? 😂😂😘❤️
Try gacha life/club plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
12:32 whats that in the middle?
She didn’t paint the part that you twist
if you ever get really bored, you should separate the bubble gum by color and then put it in the machine in rainbow order
Thrift store.  Wow this is absolutely cool 💕💖💕💖💕💖💕💖💕👍
💖
The scared chicken would have been cool with a bubble popping
I loveeeee ur shirt
nobody: Moriah:mE wAntS tO tRaCe

I have that bubblegum machine!!
Moriah please colab with halalela it would be awesome
No I don’t like what you made I LOVE what you made
I think she should do another baking vid
The gum machine is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nice
Hi glad u made it to 2021
I think you used smaller bubblegum so that might be why it drops 2 or 3. But also funny it doesn’t even need a coin lol.
She makes my day better every time I see her videos imma send her a squishy when my tooth 🦷 falls out :)
I love ur work so much
am i the only one who finds it amazing that she uses her own clips as memes? just me? ok.
1k Humans That dislikes are depressed and don’t have a humor <3

Sometimes I forget Moriah is an adult-
Aww I love the cat! It reminds me of my own cat, Lucy! c:  I miss her tho.
I was liturally watching this video and then an ad came up with her in it
I think moriah should try VR comment if you agree
I think moriah should start a romance channel with the gum all machine me ship MUHAHAHA
Bro this girl can drink alcohol
You should buy really small squishes and put it in the gum ball Machine
When she said “this took forever “ I thought she was Going to say this took 4 hours
i love how it turned out!
Makes everyday better. It's awesome for you
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her the credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishys and merch. Let's try to get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you (all credit goes to Charlie dog the original commenter.)
Who else thinks it would be cool if she customized an old wooden clock? She would put 12 of her characters as the numbers.
It’s so cute
I like your art
Is it just me or where you wishing that she done a fish bowl the bubblegum part? XD
Do you have a twin sister? I saw a video that "you" did 7 years ago and its about your "twin".
Moriah has trypophobia a fear of holes
Has she ever made something ugly
*Who is ready for Moriah to hit 6 million?* 😊
I think Moriah is the only one annoyed at her own mistakes lol   You should know by now we don’t care and love your vids gurl
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!
Just saying um...there is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design,and merch ,withought giving her credit. This is not fair Moriah works so so so hard on her merch and ideas and stealing them is not nice. Moriah probably takes weeks to make ideas and copying take seconds, copy and paste this  so Moriah can see this (all credit goes to Charlie the dog the original commenter)
I can’t unhear the “owa owa” dog from tiktok when I listen to your intro.
Love 💕 the rainbow 🌈 vibe 😊
Hi moriah I am a big fan of you like of you love her 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Its always a rainbow go on a rainbow diet
Video idea: Painting on ALL of my paint brushes 🤣🤣                                                                                                 Plz like so moriah can see :)
Please make a gaming channel
She said then I noticed" and a add came up and said this cola is amazing
Moriah, do you still live in DC? I really hope you do because I live in DC and literally no other youtubers who are famous and who I admire live here and it’s just sad cuz I feel like no one has even actually cared about DC besides the monuments and the white house.
so cute. amezing!!!
Me: WHAT NO GORGIE, PICKLE, OR DERP! something is wrong call 911
U ordered seven gums And i was busy thinking of bts
You should put tiny toys that you painted into the gum ball machine
I loved how you designed it.
Hello Moriah, I’ve been a big fan ever since the day i stumbled across your channel. Here’s a tip: When blending colours with paint, try using water. I’ve heard that it helps.
What does the gesso do?
Are you lefty ? I want know
I was just going to say I love how you use the same brush and didn’t really care if the colors got mixed. Most people are afraid to do that until the blending process
5:30 background change
HEAR ME OUT you should make top trumps cards but instead of animals, you use your characters🙃
i feel like james charles has flashback mary and moriah has the creepy cupcake version of herself
*My day going bad* Me: watches this and in 0.1 second I'm doing great
Luuuuuv your jumperrrrr sooooooo rainbowwwww I don’t know why I keep going like thisssssssssssssss
Hay you know the other dragon squishy that u have that’s a twin of rosy? Well you can paint that one like the opposite with the rainbow you can do vary light colors of the rainbow and the face you can make the face mad or annoyed. I think that’s a good idea!
Jesus Christ is coming soon   It isn’t too late to follow him
I love your videos!!!!!
Omg I’m buying one right now 👻
It's Uniqe I mean wht on dis channel ain't?
The gum hole annoys me bc it’s still red and the rest is rainbow
Mariah- I wanted to use characters I don’t use that often Me- but pickle
Just put it in a bath tub and leave it for 10000000000000 years
U SHOULD DO MORE BAKING ITS AMAZING!!!!
I liked the rough look before she blended to be honest
Wait! Did you just realize too, that when she says “hey it’s me”, is for Me (as in Moriah Elizabeth) And I don’t miss a video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love your videos Moriah, by the way!
It’s not rainbow it’s just randomly coloured
Moriah I love you, and think your amazing and the time and dedication you put into each detail of your art is unbelievable and you are SO talented, but there are 7 colours in the rainbow, not six
Haha I thought she was gonna paint on a balloon!
Just saying um...there is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design,and merch ,withought giving her credit.

OMG I love your jumper!
Imagine heart from moriah
you are soo good at it like if i have o do it its not gonna be coolest then yours
I think Moriahs paintings are wacky but wonderful
I have a suggestion that you could paint the outside of the little flap where the gum comes out of. Btw I love your videos
i love that but lucy is kinda creepy lol
You should paint your squishy that are in one of the bin and one if your squishy bin you should paint the hole squishy bin please can you give me a big squishy that you paint
Why didn't you paint the silver thing

OMG YOUR SO CLOSE TO 6 MILLION SUBS!!!
I love this video
Love your show so much
Try the glass painting
She seems oddly bitter. Is this the appeal?
I really love how moriha is always creative and loves to Express herself with curlers and her words I'm s big fan xxxx
When you said ‘Nelson’ for that green thingy, Being a South African that I am, I had to say ‘NELSON MANDELA?!?’
imagine if moriah gives these squishies and items to her kids. They would be living the life if they were girls-
It's the gesso that never ends
Let's paint the scene,   It was January 24, 2021. I was sitting in my bed, my cat murdering my toes. Moriah is talking about the gumball machine whilst painting. She says "but then I noticed" an ad appears. Suddenly, my headphones are flooded with the sound of a woman saying "do you love your vagina?"   I've been in this mental hospital ever since.
we NEED a rose plushie!! (ò A ó)/ 💖
Omg I’ve been a fan since 2 years -3 years XD xxx
Wow
Although I don't mean any hate with this, I feel like the sloth should've held the gumball in between his hands and feet rather than playing with a large wad like that. No hate but just a suggestion.
I think you should make a rubrics cube with all your character's.
Has anybody realised she’s left handed? ✨
Now I want to buy a bubblegum machine 😂
Moriah honestly feel free to donate the spare bubble gum to me😂.   I’m not joking😐
I think it would be cool if Moriah did like a full candy store with a bunch of stuff including the things related to candy like bubble gum machine etc
Moriah: And that was when I noticed-  Add: *I love to read*
Love it the characters are adorable
You should make a plushy of the sloth I would totally buy it !
Cool 😎
i love it, you should try more like these.
Why are videos are now boring
Try diamond painting
Please do something else besides rainbow
I got a ad  of moriah watching moriah  It was a ad of moriah with candycrush
Plzzzzzzzz customize a lunch box plz highly requestted
I get why you've been holding onto it for a long time😊
Can you do a video on organising you paint drawers
YASS PAINT ON RUBBER DUCKS
If you have 7 bubble gum and you put 2 and a half then that's 4 and a half not 5 and a half
You should spend 24 hours In the shop's plz and thank you pretty plz
Okay why did i Think by the hit you gave us I thought you were going to paint on chewing gum😂
Me: I want to trace Moriah: me wants to trace
👱🏻‍♀️ 👘
"The meat of the artwork" 😂Ah yes.
“Did you count how many bags of bubble gum it holds?” Of course I did do not question my intelligence
It's giving you multiple because the bubble gums are smaller than intended for it
you could put a piece of colorfull felt in the gumhole to hide the red
Omg her humor makes my day every time I click on a video 🤡🔫🌸✨
I absolutely love writing my new anime series while watching Moriah Elizabeth :>        👁💧👄💧👁
We are almost at 6 million moriah. Congrats.
Moriah:i will be painting a bubblegum machine  Me:i wonder what color will it be  Also moriah:"colors it as a rainbow.  Me:noooooooooo please not again pleaseeeeeee
🍬🖥🖨
I literally had no idea what your clue meant I thought you were going to paint on chewed gum or gumballs lol
So, I was watching all your old videos with Sam in it and after you did the whole tasting the foods from slackoo, Sam hasn't been in any others videos!! Please bring him on the next video!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I miss Sam!!!!
The cat one I feel like she is a megan better 🌝🌝💜
Please put out Gorgie the plushie 🥺🌈
How did I know she was gonna paint a good chunk of it rainbow 😂
I HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR YOU!!   PAINT ON A TREE SLICE 🪵. PAINT ON A PIECE OF NATURE STONE 🪨

You can use olive oil to remove stickers better
Burts back story:  Burt was once a happy living being but then one day a strange lady covered him up with paint 🎨 and then made him forever sad 😢.      Pls forgive me if I spelled anything wrong 😑
Thats the beast

Yo, i got a candy crush and with you in it at 10:25, I legit thought it was you editing it, untill i saw skip and in my mother language. Well played youtube, well played.
yessssssssss Pumpy the Pupkin is back!!!!

It goes on and on my friend lol
You should add your signature it would match
Wow, Moriah!   I love how you always have an idea and it comes out so SUPER great.    You truly have a God given talent, you're truly Blessed, I must say.😘😘
Wait you’re 26 but the description says that you’re 25??
Moriah: always coming up with something to distract us from the fact that its rainbow.                                                  Me: what next a rainbow pizza?! or maybe a rainbow tree, or a RaInBoW GeOrGiE?

HI MORIAH.........PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO 'PAINTING PAINT BRUSHES' AND.............I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS❤❤
When she pulled out a gumball machine SO MANY IDEAS
Who can relate like me:  Me:taps on video  Me: straight away i like the video
Maybe you could make small squishes that look like candy and put it in the bubblegum machine?
I love your videos 💞.
CUSTOMIZE A CARD DECK PLEASE I’ve been waiting plz👏🏻
her videos always make me laugh haha :)
#idea please maybe Buy another ot repiant the Gumball Machine To be a Koi fish bowl On a table
Name ur drawing cat Missy 🐈 💕 🤪 😁❤
Me WaNtS tO tRaCe         Edit: I know I’m so late I love you Moriah I didn’t mean to watch this video so late! Also I got the Derp onesie and Pickle and Derp slippers and I love them sooooo much!!!
You can paint the glass door for the gum. So then it will cover the red
Me: * sees thumbnail *  Also me: *Is that a damn lantern*
Omg it looks so good I wait for your videos!!!! I love it!!!! 💕💕💕💕
*she forgot to put her signature on it* 🥺
I have braces, I love her channel but this hurt me on a spiritual level
Moriah you are almost to 6 million!
moriah  you never new that there is a game about you named squishy magic on play store
Awecome job!! LOve it!!
Go ahead blow it don't be shy 😛
please never use the yellow backround for ur vids, it hurts my eyes
NOT EVEN CLOSE GESSO NEVER DIES
5:59 me: *what have you done to georgie-*
Can you plsssss paint on a lamp from the thrift store  plsss
Me: (yelling random things in gibberish during moriahs intro) NAN-N-NNAN-N-N-NAN NAN N N NAN N  N NAN
SOOO CUTE!!!
you should write down your backrounds
Who else think Mariah should paint on a rubix cube and a different one of her characters on each side. Copy and Paste to make it happen.
Mariah's theme song is OWA OWA and I'm living for it 😌
I drew your picture it looks just like you i wanna send it to you but idk if you'll respond 👉👈
Pls start the series of baking
Super cute! If you only want to have it dispense one gum ball at a time, you need to buy bigger gum balls.
Noo the pickle is not on it :(
Super cute idea!!
I think you can use poscas because my teacher users them on the windows
I love it so much and I love your videos
my cat is called lucie he
Behind the plastic door it's red not rainbow.
I knew she was going to paint this!
Fans that have been here a long time: - sees pink -  "We all know where this is going"
Imagine if she did not clean the inside of the gum hole and she was testing it and ate the gum
"I'm a little donut so depressed." Only OGs will remember
Best thrift store makeover EVER!!!  (in my opinion) I seriously love it!!! 💖💖
Fun Fact: This was posted on my birthday :))
moriah: “ItS ThE GeSsO ThAt nEVeR EEeeEeEeNDS” me: ...
:)
Editor: How much memes will you put in this video?  Moriah: y e s
I love your vids Moriah Elizabeth💖💖💖
like where is jOrJiE!
When I fix things vs when Moriah do it Me - why isn't it fixing ! Did I do something wrong again 🤔(100 th  try )  Moriah - fixed it ! 😁(1st try )
Is it just me... i miss oppie....
Idk why I always fall asleep to here voice!!
Sorry but i unsubscribed, lol
Moriah should customize a chess board  👇like if you agree
The never ending Gesso
“With this *very* specialized tool-“
when you put your face from the cupcake video in the gesso it scared the heck out of me 😭😭
If anyone wants someone better then this pussy then you can go and subscribe to madilyn bailey! Shes so close to being a famous person!!!!
"Guess this only cost me 6.98 " hehe i appreciate that
Moriah: haha rainbow Me: wow I’m so surprised
Me viding with pickles
Orange goo gone. Its strong smelling but used all the time to remove the gunk left from tags. Whole store worth of shelves cleaned completely
She is very different to other utubers she shows her emotions  Not just smiling 😃
Fun fact: I have never ever seen a hearted comment on this channel.
I have one of those Bubblegum machines and it’s true it will give you bubble gum for free so yeah scam
Just saying um...there is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design,and merch ,withought giving her credit. This is not fair Moriah works so so so hard on her merch and ideas and stealing them is not nice. Moriah probably takes weeks to make ideas and copying take seconds, copy and paste this  so Moriah can see this (all credit goes to Charlie the dog the original commenter)
I really want to send you mail but I’ll have to wait bc I’m only 11 sadly
she sound like king pin off of zamfam
HOPEFULLY BY NEXT WEEK SHE WILL HAVE 6M SUBS!!!!!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Imagine in 10 years she still has gesso left.
You should do bubble gum art
Love your content! I hope you keep making beautiful art and I hope you are that anything your proud of is art.
I love it so much !!
your do close to 6 mill
Hello moriah!!!! I a big fan of yours I try each of your drawings everyday I also wanna make a channel but I want a good editing app so please can u tell me from which app do u edit your vids? Thank you! Hope I get ur reply soon!
duuuuuuddddeeee i used to have one of these as a smol bean (kid) they take any coin as they were a way for kids to save money like a piggy bank. since that one spits out gum with out coins the lock mech. in it probley got broken by someone.
Moriah you should make squishy ghost using a squishy
Please make Rosie into a stuff animal, PLEASE!
it look like you bough it like that it dosent look like you painted it is so beautiful
context - 12:17 (big family gathering) my parents - *at a dinner party* HI  everyone come on in!!  also my parents - and also this junk (gestures towards me)
Everytime moriah say “bubblegum machine”  Me: it’s a GUMBALL machineee! !🤯🤯
How did I know she would paint it rainbow?
The sloths name should be Greg!🤣
I mean If people come over be like it’s a quarter for the bubblegum even tho it doesn’t need money and you make an income😉
Moriah: when in doubt possca paint pens! Me:when in doubt fart it out!
I really like this one and I love you very much lol❤❤
I don't know why but this is my favourite thrift store makeover ot was just so entertaining and the end result was so good
You should’ve open the other mystery box! from your painting on anything from mystery boxes video!!
You did a very great job
Do another squishy makeover and
You should put little Ball containers in there and put random containers of squishy‘s instead of doing your app thing
Gum ball machine 😃
Moriah: as people.... wAT  Also Moriah: they're not pEoPLe   This killed me 😂
How she almost have 6 mil i watched he since she had 200k and when she painted with a popsicle stick
Moriah , I have something I wish to say. I am a big fan of yours and want to purchase your merch so please allow the items to be shipped directly to the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. I know there are many people here in the uae who wish for the same .  Those who all agree with me , like this comment so moriah sees.
Put a bunch of squishes in a bathtub, put a blanket over all the squishes, BOOM! You got yourself a bed.
U mean the bubblegum matches the random arrangement or colors on the hat and base
Love nelson and burt
Can you maybe paint a Dino mask??? I’m painting one right now and I realized if you could paint a Dino mask, it would look so cool because your always so creative! You can get one at target or off of amazon. I look forward to your next video! -Love, the person who wrote this comment☺️
What the heck......why in the world din't i get notification for this video and just realize it now 👁️👄👁️✨
You should paint on acornes
This is amazing! I think it is one of my top ten Moriah creations
Hear me out.. Moriah should do nail Art!! I would love to see what she would do since she always wears different colors of nail polish per video
this is the best thrift store makeover that i have ever seen. your artwork is so amazing moriah!♥
Ummm bubble gum machine.. please gun ball machine
Cool and MAKE ANOTHER BAKING VIDEO! Pls.
OMG I LOVE UR SWEATER
Just saw an ad for a mobile game with you in an unrelated video. I really do not like or appreciate that. I know people have to live, therefore I accept having sponsors and stuff like that, but going out there and doing an actual ad for a cheap and stupid mobile game is on a different level. I won't unsubscribe yet or anything, but I will keep an eye on that development and if it gets worse, I will find others who do similar content and watch them instead. And I know, you/she doesn't care about one person more or less watching, but maybe I am not alone in my thoughts and with my dissatisfaction.
12:32 is it just me or does it say it needs to analyze the frames for everyone?
Can you paint rubber ducks ols
Moriah: my weapon of choice: Me: WALK WITHOUT RHYTHM AND YOU WONT ATTRACT THE WORM
I've watched this channel for years, she has made me laugh for so long. I started to notice how I never watched her anymore, always ignoring her videos so I decided to unsubscribe.  Moriah if you see this   Thanks for the good times :)
6 million here we come!!  Like if 6 million is reached
You should decorate coins to go with it! (Not real ones but like buttons or something)
If you have mini mini squshies the same size of a gym all you should put them in the bubble gum machine!
We all wish that u get 6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for naming your cat after me!! Love you!!❤
Happy (almost) six mil!
Who else be missing Sam 💔😒
AYO FELLOW FISH STICKS WE PNLY NEED 2,000 MORE SUSBCRIBERS JUST SUBCRIBE OR IM TAKING UR CHICKEN NUGGIES
this looks insanely cool :’) you’re so talented !!
You could do a white outline after the black outline to make it pop even more and do a white trace on the outside too
Please someone see this  Please customize mini squishies and put them in there
OMG THIS IS MY FAVORITE MAKEOVER SO FAR!!😍😊 Fantastic job Moriah!
And I wanna say one thing.  This is how the song ends
Me praying she'll put squishies in it🙃
Was I the only one waiting for her to blend the colors 😅
My dog is named lucy
My friend : how how much you wanna bet she’s gonna make it rainbow Me: ...........i’m not gonna bet on anything because I know I’m gonna lose 🌈 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈  Me: see
Me trying to make the same edits and failing
You make me feel better
hi I love you
why  is she so sicotic but funny
Moriah: "ItS tHe JesSo tHaT nEvEr enDs~ Moriah elizabeth 2021 Jan 22
Love your artwork and your face
these are at target  in the dollar spot area. while supplies last . so if you are inspired to paint something similar try looking for it at target.
👍
when you open squishys is it like Christmas
6:46  Moriah: his name is Nelson  Me: wait so his name is Grizzy  (Plz tell me someone gets it) 🐻
Can you plzz do glass painting?😊
I SAW MORIAH ON AN ADVERTISEMENT
It really bothers me that the glass part isn’t completely circular
Hello I am new here and your vid is awesome and amazing and cool
I'm sad.. I was 1 day late to this vid because YOUTUBE DECIDED TO UNSUB ME WHILE I'VE BEEN SUBBED FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS NOW!!!
HOLD UP HOLD UP PAUSE THE RAINBOW AND NOT ANNOYING BACKGROUND CHANGING AND NO PUN INTENDED NAMES FOR CATS, WHEN DID U TURN 26??????????????????????????  I LITTERLY THOUGHT YOU WERE 25 THIS WHOLE TIME IM THAT DUMB WOW ( I just realized that after I wrote that entire thing that I did it in caps I'm too lazy to actually do it again) when was your birthday  and Happy late birthday 💜✨🌵✨💜🪵🎉🎉💖💖💖🦥
I’m loving her shirt !
So cute
I love your videos they are so cute :3
Me scrolling through the comments and being nosey 😂.                  Although that's kinda weird but....
Hi I gust watched a graveyard loom video and he turned you In to moriah in to a sqithey
no one:  me: watching the background every second to see if it changed
Moriah: here's the final piece   Me: *gasp* she forgot to paint the little inside piece where the gum comes out!
“That just LOOKED like a screeching SOUND”
Wow I love it but can you paint a shoe rack
Hey moriah I have a question why dont you show jordon in your videos
When is fixing your squishies 25#?
When she named the cat Lucy I was just thinking name her Lucy!
Waht if there were cat treats for Opie in there instead of bubblegum  (I know that throws off the aesthetic of the gumball machine)
i just noticed that she's two years old than wilbur soot
I love your art! Keep up the good work!
Love how she casual sung....(I doubt that’s correct)to the beat of “the song that never ends”
wow ur veryyyyy creative
I can't stop thinking this, so Ima put it here.  The Thrift Store workers probably were like "This lady... Again!?"
Who else thinks she should do another art things to do when ur bored?
Pls pls pls do slime again
analyze. ANALYZE!
You should honestly decorate a new couch
AHHH SHES ALMOST AT 6 MILLLLIIOOONNN
Anyone else find it funny that when she was drawing Rosie the dragon butterfly she only re-drew the eyes? If you didn't see the vid she redid her eyes like 20 times
Love it
Moriah i was wondering if you could do a nother art trend video i was watching some of you old videos and i saw the art trend video so can you please do a nother art trend video 😁😁😁
You: bubble gum machine Me:NOOOO ITS GUMBALL MACHINE 😫 My mom wondeting why im screaming "gumball machine"
Didn’t want to point it out but you might want to paint the inside of the machine just because of how it kinda throws it off
Woah it looked amazing
I was thinking of what she can do for it and she did the EXACT thing i thought. How funny is that
I have that same exact bubblegum machine 😳
Wow so cute!!! I love the pumpkin puppy!!
3:25 MORIAH CARFUL THERE’S A DEMON!!!!
It turned out so cute, Great vid! I have an video Idea, I think that you should have your Husband pick out the squishys you paint and see what he picks, and no matter what it is you have to do it. It is and idea it would be very intresting to see what he chooses
Ik this is off topic but I got a TJ-Maxx ad and even if you think the reviews and customer satisfaction is fake, it isn't. TJ-Maxx has great clothing brands, makeup if you're into that, and amazing skin, hair, and body products. If you want some good quality items for self love time, try to find a TJ-Maxx near you. :)
I have a add right before this then I came across croissants croissants what is the add what the heck
there's a brand on etsy called TrippyDraws that just released paint pens, they work really well on glass products and are similar to posca!
This one was one of my favorites!
So cute!!!
26?! I thought you were like 19!! YOU LOOK GREAT!!!!!!!
This is super cute! What a great idea and adorable outcome!
Has anyone else been subscribed for like............
WOW THATS BEAUTIFUL🤩🤩🤩
Who else needs to see her "bake" again to survive cause I know I do
Please bring back the baking series
It's beautimous!
Who wants her to decorate a rubric's cube with one of her characters on each side! Copy and paste so she sees!
Can you make a  vid abt you squishys
Okay but what thrift store do you go to-
Embrace the backgrounds--I vote for changing them often =) Cute project!
Make a Q&A
Bring your sister yes I saw your videos and I was three 2013 I was 3 years old
Rip me it hurts to hit your elbow on the table
Who wants her to decorate a rubric's cube with one of her characters on each side! Copy and paste so she sees!
Loo at all that dist Me:look at all the chickens
My cat's name is Lucy😐🐱🐈
I have the same thing😅😆😁
Every day I'm like is it Friday yettttt????
I was here before 5 million check
But please can you show me about it saying that you’re using to open the Gumball machine
Am I the only one that didn’t know she was 26!?! 😂😂
VarNiSH ...
moriah vs. the factories
MY PICKLE PLUSH CAME TODAY! MAY HAVE TOOK FOREVER BUT HES HERE
Yay for SUZY
The original gumball machine design reminds me of benson from regular show? Anyone else?
“That just LOOKED like a screeching sound” 😂😂😂
I watched you sense you had 1mil subs, and I never got to sub because I never created an account- 👁👄👁
Hi Moriah I have I question I know this vid isn’t about squishies but what is your fav charity that you have created
The green monster thing looks like a green version of Alphys-
Me watching the video and she says and... AD: IM A BIG KID NOW
The hole being red only slightly bothers me😅
I painted my white shoes and now I need to make sure the paint won't come off... You know.;3
Got the Pickle plush for my birthday!
Hey Moriah! I was wondering if you can put Matte varnish on shoes after you paint them.
OMW SHE'S NEARLY AT 6MILLION OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Also mostly all of your art ends up adorable also I am in love with that! ( I love the design, and bubble gum😂)
Everyone : *the bum gum hole*        Just saying um...there is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design,and merch ,withought giving her credit. This is not fair Moriah works so so so hard on her merch and ideas and stealing them is not nice. Moriah probably takes weeks to make ideas and copying take seconds, copy and paste this  so Moriah can see this (all credit goes to Charlie the dog the original commenter)
I just got Derp, and I really love him, my birthday was a few days ago! Im so happy I got Derp and this is a message for people who want Derp or have him  He is so so so soft, and he makes a good desk accessory. He sits up so it’s hard for him to fall, you can make it look like he is drinking water and his cute little face makes me wanna squeeze him. Off topic, Moriah, just because you act like a child doesn’t make you less of an adult, , my dad has childish ways like you. And the end product of “Random Colors” looks nice. I wanna say Gesso like Guess so, but back to Derp, he is good company, you could say. When I am sad I look at Derp’s little...Derp face! His design is unique. I would give him a 5/5 The seem in the middle is off by a little on mines so his mouth is crooked but it still looks good! I keep calling him Pickle, I also thought Scared Chicken was Georgie for a second. I even saw the video and your welcome for adopting a Derp, Moriah.
I have the exact same machine- just less creative
I have the same machine-
When making squishes do you have to use puffy paint or does other things work?
bake with me ;w;?
the amount of memes she can make out of herself and it never getting old                          *perfection*
I’m watching her paint a bubblegum machine and I’m eating bubblegum
The end tho- 14:16 😱
You mean eight bags I would just eat the other bag
Isn’t your plant named Nelson
No one:  Moriah: **SKKRRR* that just looked like a screeching sound
pisode.... (in the description)
Idea: paint the clear thing on top so it can match.  I have the same thing but I not that talented or awesome to do it
If she reads this.......... OMG HIII I AM JUST THE BIGGEST FAN OMG YOUR READING THIS!!!!
Moriah, I just want you to know, I am a big fan. You have inspired me so much in the art department ! Lol 😂 But I have a squishy I wish I could send you but my Aunt won't let me. Im sure if I could you would make something amazing out of it, Even tho it would definitely be a challenge! - Maddie Wise 😂
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. (Credit to Charlie Dog, this was his/her original comment.) <3
You get "three" for "free"
The bubble gum coming out of the green monsters butt looks like a giant hemorrhoid   Change my mind
I am just now realizing Moriah is the same age as SSSniperwolf.-
Now a moriah elizabeth directed song: its the gesso that never endddsss
I love the video and you're my favorite Youtuber
the rainbow go's red orange yellow green blue purple the color order she did pink orange yellow green blue purple
Gurl I would have given up one step 1
Lucia is my name. 😂
That's not Nelson. That's Fart-In-A-Jar Martin. He finally became one with his farts.
Please say that you think that pink is a part of the rainbow!😳
It's a ball gum machine Me: wha-? BALL GUM ok😳
"it's the gesso that never ends" is that a reference to "the song that never ends"??
ok so i bought modge podge but when i use it it doesnt spread it like forms water droplets what do i do
I got the same kind  gumball machine from goodwill. I was boring tho, I painted it to match my kitchen and filled it with dog treats. I wanna make it so it doesnt need coins but it looks a little difficult and I dont wanna ruin the machine
My brain: you have 5 assignments due tomorrow  Me: I sleep My brain: you missed in of Moriah's videos Me**waking up**: *real sh*t*
Awwww man I was selling one
If you can I want you to Black Bear
12:32 — “New frames need analyzing; click Analyze”  Is anyone else seeing this?  Is it a joke or a genuine editing mistake? 😅
Yeah totally random design on the red part totally not your favorite design Pfft what even is the rainbow!!🤣🤣🤣

I wonder if they clean actual gumball machines
When u gave us the hint last week I thought u were painting on REAL gum
I’m glad she used the Pupkin again! He was my favorite from the stocker video!

Okay nobody ever talks about rosy I love her and I think we should have some rosy merchandise
Btw I love you I’ve watched you for so long idk how long
I want bubble gum 😙🟢
Why didnt she she wash it
Mariah: And Then I noticed-   -add plays-   Add: gotta have a WaWa   Me: Triggered

You need a clear coat song
Me: *watches video while chewing bubble gum* iNtReStInG

I have that same gum ball machine in the thumbnail
me: unsubscribing and subscribing every single 2 seconds
Me: yummmm gumballs  Moriah: struggles to paint a gumball machine for us Me: oop
Luci is my name!!:)
with the bubble gum I think you should make a cake or like do the thing wait you make art with the gum :D
i have that exact bubble gum machine!!! not the painted one tho ☝️
Knew it would be a gum ball machine
Did you know some people put the rainbow in in the order red, yellow, green, blue ,purple and forget the orange 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 but not me
I’m sorry but those characters are creepy
We are all use to ur behavior of course
I’d love to see Moriah make some things that are outside her aesthetic, like a pastel goth style
Oh my god I an in loveeeeeee with Nelson, and his fart bubble..... 💜
Why Does Nelson look like one of the among lost characters
This turned out amazing! Moriah you are so creative, don't be so hard on yourself because I can't draw anything even remotely close to what you can do! ❤
u should paint on masks like fabric ones
12:32 was that "New Frames analyzing" thing intentional?
When my older sister watched this channel I was like “it’s so childish” but watching it more...this is actual talent..
I JUST GOT A BUBBLE GUM MACHINE AND NO GUM AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EXTRA CAN I HAVE IT PLSSSSSSS
Hi girl! I love you so much and I am trying to send you a squishy!!! I am so excited!!
I was eating when i started the video- then logged off after the gum hole thing started then came back after i was done lmao
And how DARE you not include pickle he is everything to this channel ^~^
12:32 editing mistake?
Me scrolls through 20k comment to see if anyone got liked by her. me: heres my chance
Moriah: trust me it’s not rainbow.                         Everyone else: okay 👌 😏
That one poor frame didn’t get analyzed. How sad.
One day a million views MORE VIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Moriah 50 years from now: Almost finished the Gesso
IT'S SO PRETTYYYY!!!! LOVE THE CHARACTERS YOU CHOSE TO DRAW INSTEAD OF THE REPETITIVE ONES! LOVE IT
I know this is random but who else loves pickle and gorgie
Omg u made me really hungry for gum right now😂😩 But it turned out super cute! Now I lowkey wanna buy a bubble gum machine..         Also I would appreciate if you gave me constructive criticism on my videos! I just started YouTube. Thanks :)
But like where did you got your shirt  it’s amazing
Does anyone know which video editor and photo editor Moriah uses? I was just wondering.
This so cute. Love it 😍

Who’s been here since she hit 100k
Me seeing moriah elizabeth advitising candy crush. 👁️👄👁️
This is one of my favorite things you've done!
When i was like 8 years old i gave my best friend one of those. I mean it looks exactly like the one in the video
Moriah: Nice Arrangement of colours... Does she realise that the nIcE aRrAnGeMeNtS of colours is actually similar to a rainbow? ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ p.s been your fan since 2018...love your vids
moriah:owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww                                ME: I think the whole world heard that                 ALSO ME: Poor moriah :c

Moriah - "Gooey price stickers should be illegal." Me - "AND PUNISHABLE BY FLOGGING!"
Hey Mariah I love watching your videos could you maybe do something artistic for me well actually for my dog her name is Lucy and she just turned five yesterday I hope you can do something in honor of her birthday again I love watching your videos
When she gave a hint at her story.....I thought she gonna painting the chew gum😂....My baddd....Who have same thought as me???🙋
Btw when are you retiring? Cuz you have been doing yt for like 17 years
And I have your create this book2 but i kinda suck at drawing
Heres a tip for the sticky price tags. Use packing tape, put the packing tape over the price tag and take it off like a wax strip.
Forget bert NAME DAH SLOTH BROWNIEEEEEE
This is so cute I did this with the exact gumball machine
I loved the video.It was amazing. can you do a q&a please i adore those videos
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP UP THE HARD WORK
Can u do incredibox?
Paste and rainbows bring old  stuff and squishys to life
me: **has a sore throat** mariah: **decides to screech** my throat: THE PAIN!!!!
WE NEED TO SEE BAKE     Like the if u agree so she can see it!! 👇
lol if you don't want that gum i will tack it all or like a bag or have
Attendance who wants to see “paining on rubber ducks”
Lucy gives me the creeps.. she has no ✨neck✨
is moriah going to open the leftover mystery box from the painting on mystery box video?
Ok so Moriah can you PLEASE bring back the Georgie Plush because my b day coming up and did I want it
U should make some small round squishys to put inside the gum ball machine
Me: *Silent amusment*
Me: Sees her put on pink then orange Also me: Well we all know where this is going Moriah: No PaRTicuLaR OrDEr
i don't know but... it would be interesting if she made actual bubblegum with the design of her creations... 🌿
No one: Literally no one: Not a single sole: Moriah: Ek Ek Ek Eeeeekkkkkkkk. That looks like a scream
Yo this be an amazing gift for someone, it’s something you made and holds gum
That is so cute
If the red part (where the gum drops down) is still bothering you, then you could add a strip of some duck tape that is in color you like. 🙂
Moriah: Making my day better without even knowing it
I mean Why not name the Bored Sloth "Boris"
if she doesnt put ears on it im gonna be sad
Look at Moriah being very predictable with her rainbows
Moriah...why would you do an advertisement for Candy Crush...? Their game can not match your inner and outer colors!
Who remembers hannah from her one vid me and my twin.
“SpEaShIaLiZeD tOoL very rare dont ask u wont under stand”  But i’m jegit playing with one as u speak...             Sorry that i cant spell Specialized i had to use voice text for that one here and the oter i dont bother fixing
You are very talented. Thanks for sharing.
Attendance for everyone who wants to see “Painting On Rubber Ducks” (I believe the original comment was from @Katie)
You should do a cute octopus squishy!!
Your the best at what you do. And I wish I could be you!
<3
My little brother called trumps or farts pumps haha
I had one of those but it was much much smaller
Finnaly
7 bubble gum sets”  Me:ITS 8 AHHHHHH
Moriah this is beutiful!10/10 I love it
Omg idk why, but hearing her say Gesso made me laugh because I kinda want to start calling it   Guess o XD
Is it just me or was that the shortest intro ever. (Plus in the description, in the sentence "Today is another episode of ect ect." The episode is just pisode. Tiny typo) :D
moriah:im a fish me:a fish? a fish!? A FISH!?
Love it x
nElSoN
I was at schol today and i saw someone with a pickle the dino backpack      We're colors in no particular order friends
The fragile garlic macropharmacologically muddle because debtor latterly destroy unlike a vivacious behavior. unnatural, nice pancake
For months now Amazon has been selling one of your squishies claiming it as their own,ive only ever seen one other comment about this,i hope everything turns out okay
You left the gum hole red
I'm so sorry for this, but the part the bubblegum comes out, doesn't match the outside...
Can i get a bag of bubble gum😝😂😝👀
Soo cute girl
I think u should not have painted the glass cuz its very hard to paint on with pasca pens and its very time consuming
She needs to do a rainbow restriction 🤣🤣🤣🤣
no one: where are you gonna paint the real fun design Moriah: “at first i thought this was the prime real estate, this was where i was gonna do the meat of the artwork” i love you moriah! Edit: thanks for all the likes!
LOVE IT! WOW
Me:Sees the pink Also Me: RaInBoW!!! Moriah: This time its new Then Me: Doesn't see gorgie or pickle FInally ME: wait she's actually doing different characters!?
I was whatchin this video while I was eatin and now I have lost my appetite-
No...no Derp? Oh great. No Georgie? Well that sucks!!! No pickle?       PREPARE FOR MUTINY
For one of your videos you should definitely do a diamond painting they are really fun and I think you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it and also you can get one with your own art on it.
I own this exact same gum machine! Inherited it from my late aunt. I went into this thinking, "changing the classic red look to your rainbow paint job is ruining an antique! blasphemy!" but once I saw the finished product, my mind was changed. Your makeover is lovely. Kudos.
one thing: I FRICKIN LOVE YOUR SWEATER!!!!!!!! ITS SO CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"Something simple on the base" Me: Aka a rainbo 🌈
Copy and paste this message if you want Moriah to paint on rubber ducks (not my idea) started from XplantqX
No. The ded skin cells are the 99 cents
When you have 15 million subscribers, Moriah, remember me.
can you please paint on masks?
What is the address we send the squishy to again?
It looks really good.
Almost 6k + I got both of your create this book I love them!!
That gumball machine looks just like my old ones
Moriah should paint on robber ducks
ThE cOlOrS tOtAlLy ArEn'T iN a PaRtIcUlAr OrDer
omg ther is a freaking boi in my class named nelson! (nelson if you saw this comment then dont kill me but u r annoying)
3:12 I shouldn’t be teaching thisss Me: mrs. Elizabeth , best teacher ever!   Later at mrs. Elizabeth’s classroom: Teach me your ways....
12:41 You actually bought 8 bubblegum bags
Ok so I know I’m late buttt I have an amazing idea  Idea:Queen Derp,another one of the Dino’s but it’s the queen and she pink with pastel color spots and a crown  Like if this is a good idea  1like=Moriah will do this
Anyone else just want a Nelson merch set??
12:53 but 7-2.5=4.5 not 5.5???
i love it
You should name that green monster pin: Nelson the Nervous Nerd. Please copy-paste this so Moriah sees this. Credit goes to Khadijah Azhar the commenter.
My teacher has that in her classroom
ah yes, we love a good "The Song that never ends" reference.
its my dream to meet you but i probably never will and my birthday is coming up!,and yeah. My birthday wish is to meet you, THE MORIAH ELIZABETH! My b-day is February 10 i am turning eleven and one day i hope to run into you and hug you and cry happy tears but that wont happen unless there is a miracle anyway i've made so many things from your ideas and i hope to show you someday oh and even though im only ten in a half i have watched all your videos even the pageants ones and i just want to say i am your biggest fan and i hope to meet you someday! i hope to see you and you probably wont read this comment but ME forever!
Who else thinks she should paint on a keyboard
Bro, how the heck are you so funny. Like did you took comedy classes? even if those are any type of classes
I looked at the hint and I thought you were painting some type of bubble🤦🏾🤦🏾🤣🤣
I bought uour pack on squishy magic also if you want to sub to my youtube channel you can i just made my first video
I really like the design and all, but it is starting to get boring. Every thing that you paint is pastel rainbow with your characters. Again, I think that it looks good, but it is getting really repetitive. It would be refreshing if you branch out and do something different!
Ok I'm sorry but I was watching the bit were 'lucy' was being drawn and I thought in my head 'she looks like a lucy' and then BAM she's lucy😌
Hi it’s my birthday tomorrow so plsssss reply to this comment fir my birthday
SO CUTE
Moriah : pulls out pin Me : hey! It's fred the little monster!  Moriah : NELSON Me : oh, ok
Didn't you say the worst nightmare of yours is not coloring rainbows in order
Oh wait make is Bert or Bort
You should have made loads of little gum all squushies
you could of painted minni squishies to put in it
IT IS SO CUTE
I painted my roller skates and it turned out well!
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design, and merch ,without giving her credit. This is not fair Moriah works so so so hard on her merch and ideas and stealing them is not nice. Moriah probably takes weeks to make ideas and copying take seconds, copy and paste this  so Moriah can see this (all credit goes to Charlie the dog the original commenter)
Hey! I saw a Candy Crush Saga ad that had Moriah in it :0
Please notice me Moriah
IM ALWAYS LATE-
Is anyone going to talk about that there's eight bags of bubblegum instead of seven? 😳 Never mind 🤣
Cool btw can u make sloth March from the little sloth behind u so can u make some Pwease :)
i love it
is it just or does the top of the gum ball machine look like a plunger head 🪠😂
One of these days, we should make Moriah do a challenge where she is not allowed to do *anything* rainbow related. No pastel, no inverted, no dull, no normal version, none!  Not even allowed to use rainbow sprinkles.  And then we can see how she goes insane from lack of rainbow use for one episode lol.
New frames need analyzing. Click analyze (12:32)
You made that look gorgeous
i think it would be cool if Moriah did a video where she tried to decorate something the opposite of her style, such as using muted colors or only black and white, cottage core vibe w deep colors, goth, fairy core, dark academia etc. She could then sell it for charity or something :) ik Moriah likes decorating things w rainbows and fruits and stuff but it could be fun to branch out for one video!!!
i love the design that you chose
i love this series!!!! also your videos are hilarious!
I was so disappointed that I couldn't watch this the day it came out because I was out literally all day
The thought that she spent $7.00 for dead skin cells..
Donde están los Katy&Pheta
Hi
I think I’m gonna get merchandise!
Road to 6m
You are very creative!🙂
I love it
7:40 d o n ' t. I n v i  t e.H i m.
Hi everyone I love squishes😊😊😊😊😊
This is amazing !!
Can you make me one lol
Make a strawberry Squishy
I dare you to lick that gumball machine
This is my favorite thrift store make over yet! The characters are adorable and bring life to the machine.
Can you make a funeral vid for when Opie dies?
That looks AMAZING! I was worried that you would just make an aquarium out of the bowl, but you blew my expectations out of the water (no pun intended)
Everything rainbow 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
My daughters name is lucy and this just decided her Halloween costume
I’m so happy I just finally got my Cousin Derp and I love it 🥰  Thank you!
For the scared chicken you could have drawn him being chased by a bubblegum ball 😂 I’m sorry I know I’m kinda stoopid
OMG UR UN THE CANDY CRUSH AD!!
What if instead of bubble gum she put those plastic balls and filled them with drawing prompts
Please Please Please bake the dessert burger who else wants to see that?
Did anyone else notice that with the bubble gum she was doing the different parts of the bubble gum in rainbow order?!
I look away for a SECOND and there is a RAINBOW!!! But I still like it
Can you please paint a flower vase in a thrift store make over
The funny thing my name is Lucy nelson
Cant Express how much you have helped me through my tough times!!!!!!!!
MAKE OPIE HIS OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL PLZZZZZZZ WE NEED TO SEE OPIE WE HAVNT SEEN HIM FOR A WHOLE VIDEO PLZZZZZZ
Kinda freely that I have the EXACT same bubble gum machine 😂😂😱👀
Rainbow fixes everything
:O imagine if she painted A rubiks cube and each side could be like her favourite creation or a different design
I love how it looks keep up the good work :)
We all love Moriah :D I wish I could draw like her <3
I got the same gum ball machine lol
The first thing that came to my mind when I saw the gumball machine lies she’s going to paint it as an ice cream cone I can’t deal with this anymore I’m literally gonna freaking lose it
You want to know the real reason why Corona is vastly spreading?? Scroll down...                   Well, it's because of all the inconsiderate people out there who are very selfish.  Is wearing a mask really that hard? Is staying 6 feet apart (with your mask on) hard? Be a good example for the kids. I know and I understand staying at home can be really hard. You're probably sick by it know. BUT, for those of you who think that it's ok to go out now because it has been a while???... That is NOT ok. And for those of you out there that say that they have a condition (like asthma or something ) and are refusing to follow the rules? Well, then that's just an excuse to not wear a mask. At that point, you are not caring about your and other people's health. You can order food ONLINE. You can order clothes ONLINE. Find a way to minimize contact with people. BE CONSIDERATE. Just be patient. I know there is vaccine ad everything, but still...  (Spread this message everywhere!) 💕❤
Who else waits for her videos like it’s Christmas 😂 😂 😂
Moriah: omg i forgot my arms are sore Also Moriah: hits her elbow (OWW)
Best
Your the bets why aren’t you at 6 million
The part when she was displaying the bubble gum; there was so much gum the frame could not analyze it.
“Not the bum hole gum hole”
In your next video you should make a giraffe
so i have noticed over a ton of time watching and enjoying your videos, you talk about your mom and her crocheting. So i thought mabye you could do a video where she tries to teach you to crochet. Just an idea and if you see this, I love your videos and i am a huge fan
Imagine if you break the glass while you are painting it “OUCH” 😃
Moriah at 2:30: makes a screeching sound  Subtitles: *MUSIC*
The top part looks like a rainbow boob
We’re all waiting for the day when Moriah’s jar of gesso will finish
Ooooooooooooo I love ur sweater it is so cute
looks pretty
Moriah will you please bring back pickle the dinosaur and cousin derp  Georgie plushies  please 🙂
Me:I love you Moriah Elizabeth your the best You: Ummm stop I don't know you
I use mine fo skittles
It does work- Also what should i paint mine?
Me on the last thrift store makeover:i hope she dose the bubble gum machine next!Moriah Elizabeth:It's a mini gum ball machine
I have the exact thing-
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design,and merch ,withought giving her credit. This is not fair Moriah works so so so hard on her merch and ideas and stealing them is not nice. Moriah probably takes weeks to make ideas and copying take seconds, copy and paste this  so Moriah can see this (all credit goes to Charlie the dog the original commenter)
I new she would do rainbow.
That’s adorable!
During watching this video I got an ad of candy crush that has u in it coincidence I tHiNk NoT
The chickens are peep-ole lol COUSE a bird says peep
Oh mi gosh! My family has the same bubble gum machine. Just.. y’know, not customized hehe

Me: oh she is going to paint gum balls on the bowl.  Me gets more into the video: oh...

What the actual fuck was that meat sound effect
I feel like she would be really good at theatre
Moriah: My weapon of choice... Me: uhhh...

Instead of putting bubble gum in there she should of had put in some mini squishy‘s in there :>

I watch her all the time on my Chromebook and I love watching thrift store makeovers!

INCREDIBLE simply incredible
I LOVE YOU MORIAH! Im a fangirl simp and im dying because im always late

Wow this turned out amazing 😍. So cute. You're so creative and talented! Nice work 👍

Ur birthday is November 14 and mine is November 11

From colorful strokes to 🌈😂👍
Am I the only one who thought she was going to paint on gum?
I have not watched her for a long time
You should make small squishies and out it in thereeee
Who also thinks that Moriah’s series should be on Netflix? Just me?😄❤️❤️
Moriah the way your make art is amazing
Hey what vid is the crazy eyed chicken from? I swear I've never seen him before
I have that in my room
1124653796:56:12
I have one of those, mines branded jelly belly though
Who also thinks that Moriah’s series should be on Netflix?  Just me?😄❤️❤️
Moriah if you want to paint your mini squishies you could make them into guest for the chicken family wedding
I got an ad of moriah playing candy crush  while watching moriah. This is the best day ever-
Moria ElizabethI have got your pack in squishy magic
I love it!!! You should sell fluffy socks with a bunch if your characters on them :)
You look 19 lucky
Bert should rule the world who's with me??
Random question, but after covid, Moriah should enter for the amazing race!  Like if you agree!
Yay love it !!
Oh hey I’m watching you with a squishy I don’t know why dislike this yay
"Gumwhole"
“That was jaring” 😂
Did anyone notice at 13:13 the gum balls matched her nails kinda
I started feeling nauseous and I immediately ran to youtube and typed moriah elizabeth. Your videos never fail to calm me down and make me feel better :)
12:31 Uhm, I think there's some unfinished frames. I don't know because I don't make videos.
I love it super cute!
PLEASE DO A NEW ART ROOM TOUR!!!!!!!!!
You're very creative :) I wanna be like you
we have a machine that looks almost identical and it has a mechanism to switch between having to put a coin in and not having to, maybe it's the same here and that's why it worked without a coin :)
I saw the candy crush add with you in I screamed 🤣🍬🍭
U can paint that plastic part so the red don't show up anymore
My name is Lucy
n i c e
I’m..... it’s 4 1/2 bags left lol
If I ever wanted to go to her house I wouldn't steal her money I would just steal her bubble gum 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Moriah: 'okay no more sound effects'  Everyone:😭😭😭😥😓 no we love it
gumball machine be in hell
I want one
When are you gonna do the Q&A
Oe i'm Lucy and i love cats
Thrifty
Will you make a Squishy Bakeover soon?
You should have made the scared chicken being scared by a popping bubble. I love your vids! <3
U shouldn’t go to good will in corona
when she saying Lucy I got surprised because that’s my name
Is it just me or dose she have the most *perfect* amount of humore
Its's ok  make mistakes Moriah. I make mistakes in my art all the time, and they help me! :)
I love her art it is so beautiful
it looks absolutely amazing, this is one of the thrift things I really like
She makes me so happy

I love Moriah Elisabeth

LOVE IT!
*COPY PASTE or LIKE*                 *Turn Pin characters into SQUISHIES* 👍
You did a good job. My daughter watches you all the time.
why does Nelson remind me of Alphys XD
I have 2 of the exact same gumball machine
Moriah I really hope that you will do a video with halalela shorts she is great at drawing and painting and I think and hope that   if you don't do a video it for the right reasons and not that the fame has gone to your head

Fan we plz meeeeet hannah again      Edit:omg i mean can not fan but i am a fan  ❤
I've used regular acrylic paint to paint on glass before and didn't have any trouble with it, I think maybe the pen tip of the poscas is too harsh since the glass also has no give
To me “Lucy” is a too “un -fantasy” name . I like names that don’t exist .
Moriah: just a nice assortment of colours Me: hmmmmmm... Moriah I think that's another rainbow! Not that I mind ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
omg i love it
I actually have that lol
I have that gum all machine with doll heads in it
I love moriahs vids
Love the glass portion the best!
Rainbow-   *I mean randomly colored gradient*
I wish you’d taken out the red bubblegum hehe
Ah I really want that bubblegum machine
It’s basically a piggy bank coz after you have eaten or gotten out all the gum you can get all the coins when you disconnect it all
Fridays are my favorite day.
Om this was 23 hours ago so.... that kinda early Omg

5:30 this looks like a toilet brush holder
Hiiii
“I don’t think I need to apologize for my behavior at this point I think we’re all used to it.” New people: what am I, a joke to you?
When in doubt PoScA pAiNt PeNs
I agree with moriah that we should make price stickers illegal and who ever put one on something should be sented to death and the thing that had the price sticker should be illegal to use                (This is only a joke)
Paint a lamp
I would name the green monster pin  ...  Broccoli , Fartsy or Nerdy ?             You Choose
Huh did anyone notice she did not put the  sign o.m.g w here is the " me" sign like it you notice
Do the lion king
❤️
Your sooo talented
Loved this so much!!!
am i the only one who getts up and full on dances to the intro
she looks so angry to be painting that
Hey Moriah, why don't you make a squishy of yourself.... Hehe don't hate me if this gets likes.
u sould decorat a typwriter and put sprinkels on it :)
tip: W40 helps get rid of the stickiness from the stickers.
Does anyone else just wait till 4:00 on Friday and then sit there and keep refreshing moriah's page until she posts?
Petition for Nelson merch!
Why'd she ever make a nother video where she enters air questions
Wait are they *not* called gum ball machines?
I just wanna say how funny she is😂😂
U can use em on what ever u want girl.Love so much
everyone who wants her to paint on those rubber ducks!
Mariah I have a question what color is your table regularly if it can keep on changing
I'm glad I stumbled upon this. Thank you yt for thr algo. Keep doing art, Moriah!
I wish she painted the black part too
127 LIKES. IN 23 HOURS. I’ve been waiting days for a VEIW on my video! Moriah, we love you!
Lol before the video even started I knew she was going to paint it rainbow. 😂
when you're named after one of Moriah's creations 😂😂
Oh my goodness- i used to have a red gumball machine that looked EXACTLY like that
Kinda wish she went with a spiral design on gumball machine
12:32 New frames needed LOL
Rosy is like my name Rosalinda
Please do a cooking video please please please! Please please please please please
Hint:  Moriah blowing a bubble Some people:  *SHE'S GONNA PAINT GUM?!* other people:  Uhm..
Sometimes I just wish we could purchase the things you make
If the red inside bothers her enough she should just paint on top of the glass covering for the inside.
Me wants to TrAcE
Next up Moriah is going to get a mini claw machine
OK guess what I literally just thought of OK Maria Elizabeth please please please see this and everyone like this so Maria Elizabeth can see this and actually do it so my idea is what is Maria Elizabeth made a coloring book oh my God I don’t like to create this book but like just like a coloring book of all liked her squishy character she’s dead that would literally be awesome I would like to include like a little sticker sheet and I’m telling you I would be like 50 of them OK just please everyone like this so Maria Elizabeth will see this and yeah
Love it! 🌼
6:35 make him into a squishy!
l love you moriah lol
Moriah can I have the rest of ur gumb 😏😌
HI I LOVE YOUR VIDS
I have that same thing!!
OMG. THIS IS SO GOOD 😦 Moriah is just perfect ☹️😩😖😭😭
I really really really want to do this except I’d put a different candy, gum absolutely disgusts me. to eat or see any one eat. so probably m&m’s in mine
can you paint on your trash can?
S A M
SAM
I love your videos soooooooo much I have watched all of them😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Nelson: farting out the bubble gum  Moriah: you don't wanna pop that bubble Thou disobedient duphus: 😳😧uh oh
So its not a balloon? I guess I was wrong
BRING BACK SAM
Moriah, you could have put some sort of lining in the part where the gum drops down. Felt or paper or something.
PLEASE BRING BACK SAMMM
Your next video should be like panting your counters if you want- i love ❤️ your vids-
I luv your art work so much like u might say that u made it trash but u know what u actually made? A masterpiece!!!
Moriah: bumps her elbow on the table  Me: you know what that means😏 someone’s coming to visit😎👌
So cute 🥰
I would name the sloth Barnard 🦥
This has nothing to do with the video but I just finished watching the harry potter franchise and I think it would be very cool If you would make Hermione Harry and Ron squishies
Please make two days a week please please please
You should customize mochi squishy
You should put mini size squishy’s or stuffed animals
Colors give life to anything 🎨🖌️❤️ BTW I make vids!
I don’t like how the inside is still red :P
You should put your buttons in there
You know what so funny I chewing bubble gum 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why just why
Moriah is weird                 In a good way :}
Who else is just watching this on the pooper👁️👄👁️
At 1:45 I sUs BoOgEr
I like it
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Copy and paste let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.)
The Sloth is my favorite
The face of nelcin looks like one of clouds in "fixing my old art work"
you know what I just realized, Moriah is left handed
Guys there is a seller on Amazon selling all of Moriah's merch squishes backpack's etc, it's not fair! Moriah works hard on her merchandise lets try to get Moriah to this comment.
Honestly one of the reasons I love moriah is because of her humor
do u like my pfp?     gee thanks I made it     sorry I brag
Create their book?? Plz ❤️
This is the first time in 2 years im late to one of moriah's videos...
My daughter and I both said you could always paint the plastic cover where the gum comes out. This way you wouldn't see the red on the inside. We love your videos and projects you do. We've been fans for a long time <3
Do you ever get tired of rainbow and like all the sprinkles Bc i know i would 😂😂😂😂
I was not expecting it to be that big! But I love it!!! Also love ur sweater in this vid!
Pls do a tie dye or customize a blanket video
This should be the third on trending if the YouTube algorithm wasn't biased
Moriah should do a customising/tie dying a blanket
5:57 Nobody:   Me: OHHHHH I HAVE THAT PENCIL!
Could put colored foam inside the dispence part.
You should do an Among Us character
Omg-    I literally have that gum ball machine....     ;-;   but my mum had it when she was a child..   Wait.....   My grandma had it.... ;-;
I am happy you are back again ❤️
I think the gum is a piggy bank that’s and whenever u save money u get gum

I love this I wish I had one now, painted by Moriah
Love it!!!

Hey Moriah can you do an Easter edition of Squishy Makeovers. 7:26 I love that squishy sloth it's one of my favorite squishies from her Squishy Makeovers series.
Mariah: hey it’s me! Me: hi me!
I think Moriah should create a Franken Squishy using different pieces of squishes to make a new creature!!
Loved this project, so much fun!!! 🌈
I used to watch you since I was 4-10 but now I forgot about you and tried to find you because I forgot your name I watched this video. It made me laugh your amazing!!
Please do another 24 hour challenge
No wonder the sloth is grumpy, he’s getting farted on.
I find it funny that an add of you playing candy crush came up while i was watching this video
I love your sweater and nails Moriah!
It’s 😌 😌 good
You should name the sloth Borice
Why don't you just use a sponge to blend the colors- DAB DAB DAB TO MAKE YOUR art LOOK FAB

Hey Moriah! I was watching an old video and it was the one of doing things when your bored and it appears the painting of the galactic cat in the mirror, soooo I was wondering if you could make a galactic cat squishy with one of those tall skinny yellow cats that I think that you have gotten some while ago
you give yourself way too little credit morah
I downloaded squishie Magic and got your pack

Ok so give me a bag of bubblegum if u don't have anything to do w it. I have 2 sisters and all 3 of us loveee bubblegum and we'll finish the bag in 1 day :)))
You could color in some red accents to make that red inside fit in more, Idk when you have the time:)
You are the best YouTuber
i have a art hack! when i need to len colours together i grab a kinda big not small flat paintbrush XD and put 1 colour of the paint on one half of the bristles and the colour on the other half and just start painting. it helps alot!

Me:DANCES YAY MAH FAV YOUTUBER UPLOADED when I'm watching nice shirt rainbow me love ittt

Can you paint on rondom things please im a huge fan to💖
I feel like the day she draws something dark will be the day the world ends or she leaves YouTube 😂
Hey I have an idea for customizing  shoes i think you should do a tom and gery theme
10:20 <— when you never thought your favorite youtuber and your favorite Harry Potter character “Moaning Myrtle” could sound so alike.
20k comments
17th on trending!
U need to do a bubble gum ball design some day
Wait your left handed!
If we left moriah in a gray room with paint she would customize it in 4 hours because she cannot live without color 😂🤣
Is it just me or do I want to see a house tour
Wait is that a old one bc the new ones are plastic
Moriah might think that she is dumb 😂😂 but she is extremely talented I would not be surprised if she had her own art supplies in target lol
All week I was waiting and waiting for Moriah's next video I was even checking to see if you uploaded early! :s
Do you guys wonder where the coins go?🤔
I like it when her background color changes 😂
I- I just got a Moriah Elizabeth candy crush ad ON THIS VIDEO  What-
who remembers the cotton candy icecream cats?
I love it is so cute
❤💛💚💙💜
Now I want bubble gum
Everyone spam part 2 pls
Moriah I think something messed up at like 12:33
Since you have so much gesso do a video called “Painting with only gesso”
I thought she posted at 4....
You should paint bouncy balls and put them in there
Me : she’ll paint it rainbow    Her : starts painting it rainbow
You should invite friends over when covid cools down and tel them that you need to pay xD fReE mOneY lol
You should have it as a pom pom dispenser 😂
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design,and merch ,withought giving her credit. This is not fair Moriah works so so so hard on her merch and ideas and stealing them is not nice. Moriah probably takes weeks to make ideas and copying take seconds, copy and paste this  so Moriah can see this (all credit goes to Charlie the dog the original commenter)
Why did she point out the unpainted part at the end it's bugging me now
You should do a q and a where every time you get a new question you have to put another piece of gum in your mouth!🍬
Oh my gosh! I love it!! So amazing. Thank you for making videos you always brighten up my days with your art and your funny personality. Also you push me to do better in my painting and art and I thank you for that too.
🤯🤯🤯
I don’t think Moriah has made anything to do with pride ( pls tell me if she has, I’m so sorry if I’m wrong ) and I would love to see her do something *gay related! I am a part of the LBTQIA+ so I would really enjoy seeing somebody I’ve watched for YEARRRSS make something like that, I guess??? ( though if she doesn’t feel comfortable with the conversation of gays I’m sorry for bringing it up )
She should make a YouTube vid involving bubble gum in it!!!
i really wonder how you would do with an airbrush machine. like obviously there would be a learning curve but idk, you love gradients alot so i just sometimes wonder if it'd be worth you getting? though I guess it would only be for these paintover things and not your squishie vids since it has to be a more fluid medium.  idk, but fun video as always!
Lol
It is the gesso that never ends  Yes it goes on and on my friends  Moriah started use it not knowing what it was  And she’ll keep useing it forever just because
Hi
12:57 Why is that a bad thing?!?!?!?!?!?!
I LOVE YOUR SWEATER!!!!!
Imagine doing all this and your cameras  were off 😫
Love the turtle neck top
Can u pls do the Chinese fane pls 🙏
I shouldn’t have been eating when she was talking about wiping it down....
Hey Moriha, my grand daughter and I love watching your videos, you are so so awesome, 😍😍😍
Ok but what if she gives HERSELF a makeover into a squishy!!????
This is one of my favs of your creations!! Xx
Name
Not Olivia that is my mams nane
My name is Lucy
I am no complaining but you did not paint the hole but if it was to hard ok😊 I love it though
name the slot DENIS pls im desperate it needs to be named denis
Super cute! & whoa, 1.5 million views already?!
Im watching moriah Elizabeth, I got a candy crush Moriah Elizabeth advert.... Thought that was cool
Heh... My name is Lucy... I honestly don't know how to react cuz im chewing gum right now.
The thing is so great but the black small part looks a little out of place though....u could've customized that as well
That's a mini gumball machine?? That's huge compared to my mine 😂
I just fount out that you can paint on glass with acrylic paint pens I tried it out and it worked :)
It’s my birthday on Friday!!!
I have this same gumball machine somewhere, I got it for Christmas years ago but it's been missing for quite a while. This video is going to be great motivation for me to go into my basement and garage to look for it, thanks Moriah!
Is it only me who realized today that Moriah is LeFt HaNdeD
The people who thought it was gonna be a squishy makeover and waited all night :|
I agree
Moriah is like a female version of Bob Ross she makes everyday better like Bob Ross
Hey thats funky my name is Rosie🤪😊😂🤣
2:12 Very advanced. Not for beginners.
u r  awesome
I love this
how much does this cost? i wanna buy it
LETS GET HER TO 6 MILLION!!!
Hi
Turn the gum ball machine into merchandise
Colours give life to everything thing in  the world
Wow! Amazing! Great Job, Moriah! Love it! ❤️🥰
Yayyyy buttergon!   Also this design is beautiful.
PlEASE NOTICE can you do a COOKING video you haven't done one in a while PLZ🍎🍊🍋🍏🫐 a rainbow of course  🍦🍧🍨🍩🍪🎂🍰🧁🥧🍫🍬🍭🍧🍨🍩🍪🎂🍰🧁🥧🍫🍬🍭🍡🍡
Moriah should paint rubber ducks
You don't need to say sorry for making people laugh
paint rubber ducks
Anyone else bored of the rainbows now :/
Something creepy
i wanna see make something creepy something completely different im not saying i hate her art designs their amazing and cute. I wanna see her do something completely not related
omg, paint pen on glass has become my primary medium & now you're doing it too!!! im so excited for you!! things ive learned:   1. oil-based paint pens are most durable 2. wear gloves to keep your fingy prints off the glass 3. denatured alcohol will take off your mistakes (dark colors need denatured alcohol AND scraping) 4. it's so easy to scrape your paint on the second coat. i like to flood my pens a lil so i dont need to press hard, but this obviously has risks  anywho, it looks great and im so proud of you! nice job
I cant belive that the binder clip actually worked
Questions  1. Does your boyfriend truly love you  2. Do u have a real job  3. And final when do u see your brother again.
its AMAZING I LOVE IT
#nelsonjustfarted
hi again this is my second comment on this video
I love how the machine turned out in the end! Keep up the great videos Moriah!
It’s adorable!!!!
Wow Moriah, that gum machine turned out to look amazing! You're so good at this. Cheers from NC USA
I want some bubble gum now lol
When she hit her elbow.    I FELT THAT
9:37 I thought you where gonna say something else🤣🤣 Edit: Also to hide the red you could paint that little door white or a different color 🤷🏻
Do you know i have been watching your video when i was nine now i am 11 and my b-day will come in feb 8 can i have a shout out as your gift for me pls btw i love your video so much stay safeee!!!💌💗💓💞💕💖💝💘

Maria Elizabeth you're my favourite you tuber in the whole entire world you are the best
PLEASE DO PERLER BEAD ART🥺🥺🥺
PLEASE DO PERLER BEAD ART🥺🥺🥺
Nobody:  Not a single person on this planet: Moriah: That just looked like a screeching sound
PLEASE DO PERLER BEAD ART🥺🥺🥺
We need painting in keyboards?!
Funny thing I have two of those one broke (has no bowl)I kept it cuz I'm a hoarder and got a new one
It’s looks super cool! Thanks for sharing you are very talented
OG’s will know when the paint at 3:40 was made AND HOW THERE IS STILL SO MUCH LEFT!(actually thinking logically she probably re fills it LOL)
:)
You should do clay cracking
I LOVED IT! 10/10
Hey add flash warnings because some people can be sensitive to the bright colors! Thanks I love you!❤️💕
Man I can’t believe I’ve been here since the hold house I love your vids💕❤️🥰
When is Moriah going to tell everyone about her tick tok?
Who else needs this in their life
Nelson farting bubblegum is my new favorite character
What program do you edit your videos on?
Also make this mech please
Who wants her to paint a among us squishy *A blendy rainbow crewmate*
THIS IS SO CUTE!
who eles thinks she should try to draw the Mona Lisa
I LOVE YOUR SHIRT!!
Ours would take the fake money coins you could buy at the dollar store
OMG!!!!!!!! That is sooooooo good!!!! Moriah you are the BEST painter ever. I watch each one of your videos every single Friday, keep being the way you are!😘😘😘❤️
“ that looks like a screeching sound” so hearing goes through your eyes...?
hi like your videos
I love thrift store makeovers!
You should sell this (like make more copies) I would def buy one
MORIAH, YOU HAVE GOT SO FAR! YOU ARE ALMOST AT 6M!!!❤❤❤
I was afraid that she was going to paint on the glass part upside down so all of that would be a wast of time 😬😑
This is super cute!  I Love it!
That would have been a cute fish tank
Hey soo anyone else thinks that her green pin reminds of PLANKTON for SpongeBob SquarePants  or ot just me being weird (No offense to Moriah l love your vids)
Can you do a snake squishy
I would have done a bubble gum pink background with Gorgie blowing a bubble but this is really nice 👍🏻 love your work
i never notice that the background changes until she points it out 😂🤣😂
PLS PLS KEEP DOING THRIFT STORE MAKEOVERS.... 🥳🥳🥳
She thinks she is doing this for fun but actually it brightens up everyone's day
Hi
She can put her pom-poms in the bubblegum machine!!!! :D
I just noticed .... Moriah.....? ✨ *Are u left handed????* ✨
i would love to see some of your characters done in aquarell. but not modern ig-watercolor (with using white paint or pens) but old-timey aquarell (leaving space or using more water to lighten colors, layering, lifting up color etc.). i understand that it can be really hard, when you're used to acryl or poscas, but i think someone like you could master that too! i would recommend to use good paper and high quality brushes and paint like schmincke or daniel smith.   i would also love to see you try some indi paint-brands from etsy for example.
I have the exact same sweater
when r u gonna frikin BAKE!?
if the red is still bothering you, you should use felt or something similar :)
7:12 Name her Caramel.
*🔸️Like🔸️ if you want her pin characters turned into squishies.*

Am I the only one who absolutely hates Rosie the Dragon and the cat thing that she created and painted, both the painting/squishy and the ones on the gumball machine too...😬😬😬  I absolutely love the other 4 though. They are so adorable and wonderful and amazing! They are perfect! Especially the sloth, Nelson the little green monster, and Pumpy the Puppy Pumpkin!!! 😍😍😍
Ok ahe shoukd put mini squishys in there and then makeover one
Moriah I love your videos and watch them so much! I have a friend who looks pretty much like she could be your twin. She’s kinda insecure about her drawings too but she is the best out of our entire class. Also if your not ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder) then I don’t truly know who you are. I am and it’s not as bad as I make it sound, your just distracted very easily. It sounds kinda like you ngl. Anyways hope you see this and have a great day☺️👋!
Moriah: ugh so unprofessional  Me: the unonprofessionality is why we love you!
Mariah people are selling your stuff  on Amazon without giving credit just look up Mariah Elizabeth. Please copy and paste
l hope your elbow is not hurting enymore Moriah! (l know how that feels☹️)
also can you do a squishy makeover?
The sloth looks like a baby
i know im late but can i have a shoutout!!!! olso love your vids and waiting all the time to watch them
Nobody: Her: I don't think I have to apolagise for my behaviour....I think we're all used to it..... Me: laughs for 20 minutes straight....😂😂😂😂😂Love your videos, never ever stop...❤️✨ (Sorry for my bad spelling😅)

LOVE!  I think this may be my fav. thrift store makeover.
moriah: how about... me: lucy! moriah: lucy me: 👁👄👁
This turned out so cute! I love the colours!
Im decorating my old squishes
Moriah, you should make a stuffy of Nelson
I hate to be that guy, but shouldn't 7 bags minus 2.5 bags be 4.5 bags left over?
Who thought that when she put her face in the chest so it was probably the scariest thing I’ve seen all day
Very interesting!!!! 😘
E
I loved the machine its sooo cool
Hi
Moriah pls make your merch go to south Africa pls pls i am nine years and I neeeeeed the pickle bundle for schoool
When you said "hEy itS mE" i said "hi i have ur merch!"
This is SO creative! I like it, well done Moriah! 😁
Me and the ice-smore-nut cat have the same name! That makes me so happy!
I have to same bubblegum machine at my house but in pink
Moriah I'm jealous
Love love love!!!
Way better than I imagined, of course. Suggestions:  what if you use contact paper, in the color of your choice, in the chamber where the gum drops?
i’m fish girl i normally don’t like these earth thingys but, WOW YOUR AWESOME AT CREATING
There is a seller on Amazon selling your  designs, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch
I LOVE thrift store makeover. Like really.
There is a person stealing Moriah’s hard-working content. She has stole many videos of her, including old videos. Please let Moriah see this. Here is a video the person stole. https://youtu.be/t34XZyF9boc

OFICCIAL PETITION TO PAINT ON DOORKNOBS! (Like to sign!)
She is the  Best
So you need to buy your own bublegum
Video ideas  . Painting paint pallets part 3 . Painting blank pencil pouches . Painting a wall memorial with RVERY character you’ve ever made in s video  . Bake again (because your last one was 4 months ago) . That’s it😂 please take my ideas into consideration but it is your choice it is your channel 😁. Also copy and paste this guys so she can see it a lot and take notice 👍 also Moriah if your watching this please heart this video because I’ve been watching your videos of nearly three years now and I’ve never got bored of you and your so funny and hilarious and entertaining.     Please heart this 🙂.  Yeah I know it’s a lot 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like the results
*Who thinks Moriah should paint rubber ducks and put then into the gum ball machine?*
I love that design! It's beautifully done. I live that Moriah used less "common" characters. Scared chick is one of my favourites!   Does anyone else wanna go out and find a gumball machine to create with now?
This is so adorable! Best bubblegum machine ever!
Hi ,a really like your vedios ,you all ways make me laugh ,can you paint on your trash can?
NEXT VIDEO I BETTER SEE YOU EAT BUBBLE GUM ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Theory. Her squishy’s refill her gesso every night so she doesn’t have to buy a new one.
I love her drawings she is so creative 💜💜
O my that's so beautiful love you and your videos
Yes beautiful work I love it
That’s amazing!!!!!!
I have a gumball meshin 😂
Hi can u please make a other Q&A please
I love the newer version of the bubble gum machine (and the sloth on the glass part looks super good)
U could call the sloth slo-mo or Borek🤣
Petition for moriah to paint a claw machine and put squishes in it

Something was bothering me and i dodnt know what it was until you told me it was the red gum holder part duh..
9:10 Hey, there's Fred hanging out in the corner!
Now it’s yellow nope green I mean purple no no pink! Ok ,make up your mind !!!👺
Yoooo I got that same gumball machine
Moriah posts   Everyone: *RUSHES TO COMMENTS*   Me: *Enjoying how awesome Moriah is in her vids*
the sloth is my favorite
Cutest bubble gum machine ever
I think you should do a challenge where you don't do any rainbows at all
When you were making scared chicken he could have been scared because the bubble gum popped in his face
5:43 No you dont lol
nelson stole my name 😑
If the red bothers you, you could probably just paint on the outside of the plastic portion that covers the gum hole. Personally I think it looks great as it is!
Disgusting 🤢
Road to 6M subscribers💅❤❤❤❤
OMG :O At 7:11 when she said l..l..Lucy  I knew it was lucy
im bad at art but u just make my day with your art and jokes
Please please paint the inside where the bubble gums come out plsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I've been watching her since I was like 7 I'm 15 now
My name is rose
LOVE U MORIAH do u know your name is jewish are u?
I love her sweater
Omg I love thissss! Absolutely amazing. Your art is amazing and your art style fits you perfectly!
Im in a ad rigt now and i think the vid is super cool😁💗btw i subed
Hey Moriah, this isn't to be mean or call you out, because you might not know, but Goodwill is a horrible company that exploits disabled employees, paying them as little as less than half of minimum wage. This is called sub-minimum wage, and is extremely unethical. I've decided to stop shopping there because of it.  No hate, I've been watching you for like 3-4 years, I just wanted to spread the word. 💖
OMG Mariah u literally make my day! Each time u do a video I get soooooo excited to watch.Also u my fav YouTube :) I LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.    <3
Always makes my day 😂
#loadto6M!
ILOVE YOUR ART
When she said gum hole I thought she said GUM BOLL 😂
3
Is there going to be a creat this book
Wow
Me having the same bubblegum machine: 😏
Love it 😍😍😍😍😍
This was an amazing makeover,  it looks so awesome!
OMG YOU POSTED THIS ON MY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYY IUEASHF AUHFRIUAHADFUHF
You should do w video of painting them blank pencil pouches that you have     Copy and paste this guys.    Like if you agree
I love it!!!! It’s so cute
Congrats on almost 6 million subscribers :)
I JUST GOT A PICKLE PLUSH!!!! AND A PICKLE HOODIE!!!!! YASSSS
What did you send me Set to me a notification I was watching  YouTube
Love how the machine turned out! The reason mulitple gums are dropping may be the size of them :0
You should do a video of painting them blank pencil pouches you have    Cop and paste this guys.        Like if you sgree
A gluey Price sticker watching 2:00 : They ask you how you’re and you just have to say you’re fine when you aren’t really fine but you can’t get in to cause they wouldn’t understand
I love the the bubble gum dispenser
PLEASE PAINT ON RUBBER DUCKS
You made a beautiful gumball machine i think this is better than the other one not being mean though
12:50 7-2.5=5.5 not 4.5 Mooriah .I still love u nd ur videos tho .Dont take the first line in a wrong way
pretty of topic from the video but ima just put it out here.moriah is one of only a few youtubers that even almost 3 years have passed since i found her channel i still found all her videos entertaining.most of the time the youtubers i stuck with before got pretty irelevant to me especially as i grew older but moriah's channel is different and im forever glad to have stumble upon her channel that day.givin lots of love to you moriah and also to all of you please stay safe😊❤
Bubble gum give away. I dare ya
Moriah is very colorful⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅
Do you know the red inside of the bubble gum machine actually makes more sense than people know that you designed it yourself it would also be funny if you used it in your next video like it is like I’m hungry and I eat bubblegum
if you don’t make a series making small squishiest or other things to put in the gimbal machine I will be pressing charges no questions asked.
Sell the leftovers on a Facebook group!  Also, looks SO good - fantastic job!
it is so cool I love it
Moriah where is sam your brother??
Hi

I smashed my tow fingers awch
Moriah: * puts bubble gum in* Me:* starts to feel the urge to eat chew some bubble gum * NOW
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SWEATER THAT IS BEAUTIFUL 🤩
You should name your sloth Sami or Sammy
Is there something wrong about that rainbow, or is it just me ?
Honestly this is your best work so far!! the amount of love and attention you put into it is amazing!
Anyone else get a Moriah Elizabeth candy crush ad on this Moriah Elizabeth video? Lol Edited to add: I absolutely love how cute this is in the end!
THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL
7:10, ME: how about Lucy   Moriah: how about Lucy   Me: NANI !?
How do I send you something? Someone pls tell me
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😱😱😱😱
Moriah:Ok no more sound effects Literally Some seconds later AaAaAe Time stamps~ 5:24 to 5:59
Awww I thought it was gonna be edible paint on gum 🥺✨       Jkjk idc I’m happy either way
Actually, the "fact" about dust being mostly skin particles is actually false. It's more fabric particles than human particles. I recommend Veritasium's video covering it, if you want to get more in-depth.
Hi!! Let's get Moriah Elizabeth to 6 million subscribers
When you were painting I had an idea of how about using poscas to make circles to look like bubble-gums but no offence it looks really good and pretty!!
SOOOOOOO CLOSE TO SIX MILL
Love love love love love this😁like a lot
The cat and bubble gum dog are kinda creepy.
Oh my gosh i cant say how cute this is enough
No one: Absolutely no one: Not a SINGLE soul: Moriah: EeEeEeEeEk.  That look like a screech
Moriah lives in raiinbow heaven Literally
The gum hole doesn’t match no hate though
6:30 the last video i watched of heres was the shrinky dink lolʕ•ᴥ•ʔ my fav was...                            Pupkin!
I really really love your creations 💗💗

That rainbow design reminds me of that barney movie with the rainbow egg. Lol 😂
Hey can you make a crewmate plush from among us or an imposter plush
Do you eat from this gem thing 👁️👅👁️
I LOVE the cat. (I forgot her name)
Love her channel so much so creative
That was so good! You know what would have been cute too, if she made a bear, with the glass as the head, and the top as a hat! But I feel what she did was way better ❤️ 🧡 💛💚💙💜
Anyone else obsessed with her nails?    I also love Nelson
I think the bubble gun was to small so it gave you more lol
I would love to spend a day with your creative brain haha I struggle to come up with ideas!
cool 😎
At 9:50 next time that happens try using Mr. super clear that should help but it is a spray can
Moriah: Alright, no more sound effects.  Everyone else: sure........
I was praying that she should not do rainbow.... But here it is... 😥😱😌
Amazing
These videos are the best part of my weekend (even though I need to wait 18 hours before I can actually watch them)
Lol i got a candy crush saga ad with you advertising it in this video
I love the moment when she said "this is the gesso that never ends"  😂😂😂🤣🤣😱
Moriah you should do a bubble gum giveaway
Hear me out. Her and superraedizzle. Friends. I feel like they’d be good friends
if someone googled panting in gumball machines and found this they would probably leave
Have u always drawing with left hand??
i love your vids
Where is Georgie and pickle make him in a bubble gum whatever dang glass thing it’s like a Bubba cup cup with a whole bottom and top?
moriah paint with an eraser on the end of a pencil, its a challenge
I would like those bubble gum bags ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I have your merch 😘pickle
plot twist: she changed the background colours on purpose because of her rainbow addiction 🌿🍃
This is such a cute and amazing design! I loved how all the characters looked!!
So beautiful! Great job Moriah 😄
Man you sure have got alot of millage with that cupcake video
26? How did I not know this??? Im genuinely surprised 😅
GORGIE is the BEST you should have drew him on it
You should paint a gituar!!
It’s so cute!!!!!!!
Instead of painting the part where the gum falls, you could have just put some felt like in your jewelry box thrift store makeover.
The bubblegum gets a red carpet
My brother used to have that type of bubble gum
I have an idea, I hope I don't sound rude, but you could've did the little stripes and an outline of the despenser in red to make it look like you meant it, just an idea, hope I don't soud rude <3
7:03   She looks like gru 😅😂🤣😂😅
When she said that see was sore I was like nah I got it worse my back is screaming and my legs are dead
HOLD ON A MINUTE MORIAH NEEDS HER OWN SHOW LIKE IF YOU WOULD WATCH IT
Thank you for being so amazing I love watching your videos and I want you to know that you make so many people happy in one day!!!!!! So thank you
And behind door number one is!!!!!   "Cobwebs"
I'm kinda early!!!!
GUMBALL machine
Who else almost never notices the background changes?  Just me?  Okay 👌

The gesso that never ends reminds me of that one tiny shampoo I have that I've been using for a long time and every time it runs out the next time I check its full again????
I like how she made Nelson farting 💨 😂
but then I noticed...   gets an ad
I have been watching you for years and I haven't subscribed-
I love the sloth thee best
Nelson reminds me of dr. Alphys from undertale :/
Moriah, I just got your squishy pack on Squishy magic. I'M SOOOO EXCITED
This girl made me obsess with Rainbow lol
I have I am not going to lie that exact thing 😂 no joke. my mum got a thrift store too a while ago. it's in my brother's room
GORGIE PLEASE COME BACK! Anyone know where to find a half pineapple half duck? :p
I love the idea of her characters with gumballs.😁❤ I love your channel.
I LOVE IT
Moriah : When I noticed 1 SECOND LATER Ad comes on : WE HAVE A PROBLEM IF THE SAME HAPPENED TO YOU, REPLY AND LIKE
I WANT TO SEE HER PAINT ON (Laptop, Ipad, iPhone, keyboard, rubber ducks, air pods, a pop figure, and shelf) :>
you should try glass painting
Woww!! This was super duper cute
it is so cute!!
Am I the only one who would listen to moriahs intro  for a whole hour:^
This looks awesome! I kinda wanna paint one XD
I could be little bit better if you would have painted that annoying black part . But its good like this also. Because I always ruin my artworks by overdoing them . <3
Love that! You could paint the little clear/glass window into the inside! So you dont see the red but it's not painted on the inside!
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Copy and paste let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.)
I saw some bubble gum packs in ross and tj max
Please can you do a baking video.....pleaseeee
S
I love your video
Thisssss is soooo cute!!! I think this is my favorite thrift store remake!! Love you!!! Cant wait to see what’s next!
The dislikes are people who are jealous of her imagination.
2 things here: 1. how come haven't you put the bubblegum in rainbow order? 2. THE EASTER VIDEO MORIAH I KNOW IT'S EARLY BUT JUST TO REMIND U
Can you do another fixing squishies in the hopeless bin video?
I absolutely love this!
Gessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssesssssssssssssooooo
Please make more create this book video please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
*Background changes* Moriah: So unprofessional
"i shouldn't have to explain that do i?" Actually.. you do From a few comments here and from other places ive been in before a ton of people seem to not know what these are or only saw them in cartoons and didnt know they were a real thing  *Our age is showing isn't it? xD*
I barely even notice background changing untill you point it out
You should do some more spin the week.
Give me all the bubble gum‼️
3:52 "But then I noticed" AD comes on: "Your mother is a special lady"
I love this! But If you ever get another one make it a bear or some other animal it was perfect shaped for that
So the under water fish scene I wanted is out the window 😔 but it's ok it came out great

The cat can could be named Lucy
Moriah: with the meat of th- Then there is a McDonald's add about meat  WOW

In her next thrift store makeover she should paint a lava lamp that would be so cool!
So that spare bubble gum is... Is it free

why does rosie not have a bubble gum
Moriah's voice at 10:16 🤣
𝗝𝗼𝗷𝗼 𝘀𝗶𝘄𝗮 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁
That is so many gumballs
would've been cool if the characters where like bubble gum looking, or even bubble looking.
Please make a rubix cube!!
New itttt     (I didn’t)
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah’s design, and merchandise, without giving her credit. This isn’t fair, Moriah works so hard on all her squishies and merch. COPY AND PASTE! Let’s try and get Moriah to see this comment! Please help, and thank you!
When Moriah said we this is where I am going to do the meat of the artwork an ad about meat popped up
.yay she is back and PAINT RUBBER DUCKS .
Name "him" jeff 😂
I am glad she's not painting on actual gum cause that's what everyone thought on her spoiler where she blew a gum bubble😝😂
Omg I love what you did but I just realized you could of made it Galaxy Cat
U deserve 70 million subs cause ur amazingggg, entertaining!! And creative ❤️❤️ it's just soooo fun !❤️❤️😎👍 Ur doing great!!!!
The second she pulled out the paint i was like it’s rainbow isn’t it the she was like random colors and i died of  laughing
I'd kill for that machine, because of the colours and because you get bubblegum for free
Dang you get ALOT of likes in less than a day-
Your such a great artist I feel like you are my best friend
Me (as a 8yr old) : Idk what she said  M.E. : if u don't understand me want to trace  me: ohhhhhhh What messed up magic is this
I would have put pompous in it instead.
Why don't you name the ice smore nut cat lizzie
Yay!!! I love these 😇😍
Rosie! I feel like I'm Rosie the Buttergons biggest fan. I was so excited to see her in this video.
I just loveeeeeee her soooo much 🙃🙃
IVE JUST REALIZED THAT MORIAH IS LEFT HANDED??!
*patiently waiting for moriah to hit 6 million*
Moriah worry about the spray and how you can see the brush lines   Me worry about not being able to find paper lol
GUYS PAINTING IS SO HARD! i tried and failed
So the characters are in a rainbow order too😂
"That just looked like a screeching sound." -Moriah 2021 I HAVE NEVER RELATED TO ANYTHING MORE IN MY LIFE!!!🤣🤣
3:21 😅
That is so cute 😊
so cute. so cool.
Moriah: I won’t paint the red part because that’s where the bubble is going to drop   Me: yea your right don’t wanna risk contaminating the bubble gum   Moriah: I down want the bubble gum to chip the paint  Me: 😳wow.... surprised but expected
This is one of my all time favorites that you've done
This is not worth the 7 bucks Until Moriah Elizabeth did her job!!
Fun fact:everyone reads the whole comment if there is a fun fact at the start :3
who else wishes they had a bubble gum thing like that in their bedroom. Me!!!
She makes every day better with her paintings. she just doesn't know it. BTW I make vids!
Moriah: "u can see my reflection that's so distracting! me: "i litterly only noticed it when u pointed it out. (i also liked the sound effects 0_0)
I have the EXACT same one!!!
im a simple girl.  *i like bubble gum and moriah elizabeth*
Lol 😂🤣🤣🤣 I died when she said bum hole 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should have had sort the bubble gums by color and put them in in a rainbow order 🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
Someday can u do an among us squishy?
Omg so pretty
I actually have that machine
OH my god,Pleaseee if you hit 6M pleasse paint one of your squishy in your face Hehe🤓👀💜.  -Like if you agree
That sloth describes my personality during school xD
I am going to a thrif store today I will see if I can do something like you did and find some stuff
Can you paint on rubber ducks please
I love her sweater
6 MILLION PARTYYYYYYYYYY
I just wanted to ask, have you considered a plant based diet (being vegan)?
Hello I think that your videos and art is really really good I wish I could send you something and I was as good as you at painting and drawing I know that this is not an excuse but I am visually impaired so I cannot see colours very well or other things so drawing is a little bit hard but I hope to one day be as good as you
Need to wash it first you need to wash it first these new start painting it I mean you wash it really dry and then you paint it and then you were drunk and you put the demos and then your favorite color become older and then just put in there and then screw it in
Wow! Tom Servo from Mystery Science Theater 3000 has never looked better! But seriously- great job!
Please react to your toddler and tiara hahahaha tiana the princess
You need to take that on all your meet and greets and business meetings to get rid of the gum
In her spoiler everyone said this: Me: OMG SHES PAINTING GUM!! Everyone else: She’s painting a gumball machine!!! But literally nobody said she was painting a gumball machine.
I looove thrift store makeovers!
I love this
"catsmornut" okay over here what about smor"cat"nut (like if you disagree)
This is my favorite makeover from the thrift store! So cute and unique!
Now the ice-smore-nut cat Lucy can be an Ice-smore-nuble 😂
Hey Moriah!!
Who else wants Moriah to do another “Bake With Me” episode?!?!?
I love the scared little chicken He is my favorite character in Moriah's channel bcuz he's soo funny😂
Moriah is awsome!!!!!!!
No one:   Moriah: Making weird sound affects because somethings look like a noise
When I was little my sis got gumball machine and it was cool cause u got gumballs ftom it :| it was nice
we knew it
does anyone else never notice when her background color changes? I never even realize it until she mentions it.
That was sooo cute
Vid hasn’t even been out for 24 hours and already has millions of views 😭
Moriah, have you ever considered being a comedian
Love the bubble gum machine. I just love those. Reminds me of my childhood. Yes I am a 40 year old in love with Moriah's videos. Good job like always and I want one so bad:)
i thought you were going to make a fish tank and paint fish on the glass bowl part and have the bubblegum be like the little pebbles
Same
Painting on rubber ducks "copy and paste if you want"
What you doing the other mystery box
Is it only Me who thought she was gonna put squishes in the bubble gum machine? Lol
OMG every time i think this is the time that she messes it up and NO it never is you always make it look phenomenal
CONGRATULATIONS OMG AHHHHH
She forgot to paint in the gom hole!
How come NELSON gets to be on the gum ball machine but now I’m not worthy?! 😡 why?
lol she painting a thrift store
I just found this video Recommended to me and Girl what have been saying while watching this.                         YOU ARE SO FUN  You just earn a subscriber❤️
I might be wrong, but I think that multiple pieces of bubble gum were coming out because the pieces were so small. Don't quote me on this though, because I'm not sure.
•invitation•       For awkward sloth
Why show the dirt. In ittttt 😩🤢
My dogs name is Lucy. BTW you are my fav youtuber ever. I love you!
7:30 Slothey
the more you subscribe to youtubers...                                                   the more the youtuber you subed to ALMOST gets famous               Everytime bruh everytime
I am asking about it why did u do that
This is amazing 🤩 I love it
3:25 instead of James Charles coming from darkness it’s Moriah coming from white paint.
Maria I have a question do you actually have a twin sister
Moriah: It's the gesso that never ends Me: *Never ending geeeeEeEessSsssOOOooO AaaAAAaaaAAaa*
it will be like this soon: + what is your favorite color? -rainbow
You may be a legal adult but your are NOT a mental adult😂
I think Moriah should be a voice actor! Anyone else think the same thing?
I’m getting Melvin Sneedley vibes on Nelson
You should sell gumball machines that you make.
5:03 Moriah: oh and look at that will just make the same rainbow i mean colorful lins   Me: it is a rainbow we all know that moriah
“I’m really glad I chose to paint on the glass”  Well of you didn’t the video would be 5 minutes long
You saying "bubblegum machine" bothered me so much. It's a gumball machine or a candy machine
Then I noticed    A clown on a add came up   😂👁👄👁
It was very creative and indeed looks nice!!!
Pls Moriah make a video of you panting some of ur rubber ducks ps: I love ur videos
Love your art, I can’t watch this at night or else I will wake everyone up from laughing my head offf 😂
When Moriah started the video she was so excited to paint when she started painting she was like not excited any more
Luvvvvvv ur sweatshirt umm turtleneck?
Hi I love your video you are so amazing and funny
Nelson is now my new favorite character 🤚
CONGRATS your 280th vid  Well done 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩
U are the best can u pant a squashy donut
Keep craftipainting ,inspiring and rocking all the time.
You could put Pom poms inside the machine instead of gum balls
Moriah,I CAN SEE THAT IS RAINBOW NOT RANDOM COLORS
Kan you mak a bird pls pls pls 😭 😭 😭 😭

Yas
I LOVE YOU ART 😍😍😍🎨👌
Are we going to talk about how the intro sounded different
I really like the bubblegum machine btw
I loved the video
can we see a among us vid plssssss
YOU'RE 26 CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION TO 26
I love gum ball mechines
No one: Moriah: * sees a random object * I can paint you
New frames need analyzing; click Analyze.
I have used poscas on glass
Anyone else love Friday because she posts a video!? 🙋🏼‍♀️
That came out SUPER CUTE
I though the machine was gonna be smaller xd
Is it just me or does the gum ball hat look like a school bell- just me- ok-
One of my teacher’s names is Miss Nelson 😶
WE NEED A NOTHER BAKE WITH ME
I have that exact mini Gumball machine at home
Hey  moriah you  scut  make   homemade  squash  with  pepper  and  theyp or oso glue it's  really  easy I made  e lot   you scut tefently  tray it o en I love your videos ❤🧡💛💚💙💜💝
Changing the backgrounds for each piece, may be an accident but I find it helps the viewer keep along with the steps and it’s easier for the eyes. I’m just a little comments in a whole ocean of them but I would really like to be heard and have this be a new thing from now on : ) also... moraine I love you and your creations so much ❤️❤️❤️
Me and my friend are thinking of being a YouTube artist
can we have some bubblegum ;)
Moriah name the sloth squshie Milo.
I have always wondered how did you animate your intro's?
Reminder that you wanted to do an Easter squishy makeover in one of your older videos
Wow it was soo beautiful and cuteee
she is the art teacher we all wish we had
Me : refreshing the page for her to hit 6 mil
I love your videos and art😍😍🖌️🖌️❤️❤️💗
Hey moriah is there a chance I have adhd I have adhd and u seem like u have adhd???
This is so creative. I absolutely love the stuff you come up with
Anyone else notice those CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE nails the minute u put on the vid?
You should put all your panda buns, or paint you rubber ducks to put In there!
Just for future reference... if you wanna get rid of that gap between the object you're tracing and the glass... fill it with rice! It's really helps❤ love the final result tbh!
Omg!!!!!!!
I wonder if right now, as your reading this she’s taking out some bubblegum..
I love it!!! It is such a creative idea to paint a gumball machine and the characters are the best!!
I'm really happy them you gave an opportunity to your other characters 😊 all of them are amazing
Or u ok Giro 😊
Can you paint on CDs? I think Georgie would be adorable
The thrift store watching: 👁️💧👄💧👁️🔪
I don't even like bubblegum but damn that machine is cute.
I just realized when moriah said "I'm 26" I had been watching her for 3-4 years cause I remember her saying "I'm a 22/23 year old" some time ago
Me: realizes that I have the name of the ice-s’more-nut cat  Also me: ✨I’m SPECIAL✨
The Sloth don't need a name, de is fineeeee
DO MORE OF CREATE THIS BOOK 2 NOOOOOW I MIIIISSSS IT DO ITTT!
I wait every Friday to here the words hey it’s me 💖💖💖💖💖
Opie 🐱🐱🐱
I had on of those machines my brothers friend Broke it

Iam.  Big. Fan.  Your.. My.  Name. Is.  Sicret
I think maybe the gumballs were too small and that's why so many came out
Du. You. Have.  Kid.. Plis. Replay..
I have transformed into a Rainbow s’mores cat. Watch the vid a you’ll see what she names her. A clue: My name is Lucy
No one :         Me: i WaNT thAt BuBBlegUm MaCHinE
If you like ROBLOX like
pumpy the pumpkin is my favorite character
As soon as I seen it I knew that she was going to do rainbow 😂😂😂
Reply to my comment if you are watching this in 2021
subscribe to jack helland. MORIAH ELIZABETH CAN YOU GIVE JACK HELLAND A SHOOT OUT PLEASE>
Why did I know she was going to say “it’s little hat” at 3:31
3:34 She had the GuTs to scratch the MaTcHiNe  what if she messed up? what if the paint scratched off?
For the little red part, you could've covered the glass piece with paint, making the red on the inside not visible.
These vids attract me
Am i the only one that is bothered by the fact that she didnt shine the metal plate it woulda looked so much better in my opinion
I love how she used her pencil merch to draw
Moriah: it just looks like a screeching sound Me: how do u look at a sound?-
haha i love the new look
My sister thinks you are so good at art I think so to
Almost at 6mill subs
Me seeing this vid in 37 minutes being early and after 16 hours later I still didnot see it NOOOO >:(
Thank you Moriah! Your video's make me get through the week waiting for the next one!
Hold up are we not appreciating that sweater!! Love it and as per usual moriah is pulling it off like a queen😍😍
:0 🍰
Idea from Zafira Fatimah- Moriah painting all her characters on a giant canvas (copy to make popular )
When anyone says gum all I think is  Bungee gum contains the properties of both rubber and gum you see 😅⭐️💧
one of my favorite things you’ve ever made
12:40 HARRY POTTER??
Squishy machine 😂
SO. COOL.
Oh i love Rosi, she is so cute. :,)
i own the same one
a little thing for Moriah is that WE LOVE HER WIERD BEHAIVIOR NO MATTER WHAT !!!! dont apologise for what ur vids are so famous
Is it for sale
5:21 why do I like this so much
I think Moriah should paint a rubix cube with each of her characters on each side/square
How do u get a million views in less than 24 hours?!
I recommend putting tape on price tags and pressing on it so It sticks well and then rip it off it should make it easier to take off
You are the best
moriah: i didnt know what to do  me: *screeming* PAINT A CUPCAKE HAVE THE BODY AS THE LINER AND THE THINGY AS THE CAKE AHHHHH
I love it
Omg
"price slips shouldn't exist" *wiser words have never been spoken*
wait does she support the lgbtq community ? ༼·͡ᴥ·༽
me - why does all my gesso go away even if i paint once a month  moriah - how do i still have all this left in the container even if i use this all the time  1 like - more gess to be left
Her vid was posted yesterday and it already has 18,590 comments!!!😃
SNORBERT the sloth <3 why not !D
gumball
I kinda wanna see her do digital art
Hi
I love it its amazing
It feels like my bday everytime Moriah posts
me: actuauly paying attention to everything   Moriah: points out something im not even paying attention to
Omg its so nicee🥰🥰🥰
Love the nails!😍
An rainbow what a surprise
Hi Moriah! I was watching this video next to my mom and then she ended up watching the video aswell and said that you were very creative and I should be like you one day lol
you really need to invest in this one thing called workable fixative spray it seals what you have done so you can work more without messing up what you like
Mariah: post a video  Me: my day is 1000 times better
Oh rosie!!
He is cute
hi
OMG I LOVE YOUR ART
Who else agree that Melody is a PERFECT name for the ice smorenut cat? Plz like this so we can get her to see it!!!
Not a good idea to eat while whatching 😵
Its the gesso that never ends
I have an idea for a New carecter :a  cat wrappet in a burrito blanket with whiped cream on top of his head and a cherry on top of the whipped cream and his  hands Will be messy with the filling of the buritto(that cat is oppie btw) and i don't have a name for It...
I loved this
LOVE THIS SERIES
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO SO GOOD IF THE DARK THING IN THE MIDDLE THAT TAKES COINS IN WAS PAINTED TOO!
When she showed the hint           Me:is she going to paint gum?    Her:I am going to be painting a gum ball machine                          Me:oh 😢
If anyone is a girl here and you played baseball was it only me but my coach always put me and all the other girls in the back where the ball never goes
New challenge idea! You should use the colour of the gum balls you get out using the dispenser for a painting So basically dispense out some gum balls and whatever colour those balls are you have to use those colours in an artwork
hi moriah i love you soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. you are my altermite favourite youtuber. if i was aloud i would buy your merch. please can you do PAINTING on your or other youtubers MERCH.
It's so magical 😭😭😭
im just suprised moriah isnt a harajuku decora kei girl yet
*Attendance for anyone who wants to see moriah painting among us themed squishies*
Moriah:And then I realized   Commercial: Pampers!!
LOVE the JuMpeR
*Attendance for everyone who who wants to see Moriah do chalk art* plz do it Moriah!
How to describe Mariah‘s aesthetic : *rainbow... I mean isn’t it obvious*
I really like the pumpkin puppy 😊🎃
I knew you would paint a bubblegum machine! Anyways it's cool! I like it tbh, I would like to buy it if it's available
I’m so happy you did not so popular characters. I’ve honestly hoped for it cause I think Pickle and Derp are very simple designs and think you are more talented than that.
Plsss paint the rubber ducks
(:           :)
Where is the second mystery box video
I actually love this makeover, it’s so cuuuuute
HAHA she got soooooo much bubble gum
If you want to remove gooey price tags easily : warm them up with a hairdryer and peel slowly as you keep blowing warm air to the tag. That way, the sticker doesn't tear. Cheers ! :D
Heyo Moriah: For future projects: As a window painter (Ya know the ones that go up in shop windows during the hollidays?) We use Acrylic. If  you make a mistake you can scrape it off with a razorblade of some kind. Thats why we use it: Fewer mistakes.
Moriah you should do a video on painting rubber ducky’s
butiful UwU
I love you and I have one  squishy  and you have it I saw it in a other video there is  not one day I do not watch you  videos
Moriah that greattt!!!!i hope u see my comment but i wanted to ask u if u can make a butter bear family from scushiess
We want ‘Painting On Rubber Ducks’
Elizabeth is making me happy every day when im sad
Hey there Moriah, I really love ur work, they are all so amazing! I have a couple of questions: 1) does acrylic gesso really help to cover the surface? does it scrape off? Is it easy to paint on? 2) in one of ur videos I saw u using a high gloss acrylic finisher and I have been using it to protect some of my own projects but this one time it completely smudged off some paint, I was wondering if there was something better to use than acrylic finisher. Because to be honest I am scared to use it again.  If u or anyone in here could answer these, I would be so grateful. Keep up the good work Moriah
Hi
This woman is so creative. I love the way how she collaborates comedy and art in such an amazing way 😀
Am I the only one who wants to buy that?
You could have painted the covering of where the bubblegum comes out. Then you wouldn't see the red and it wouldn't chip either
Can you give me a shot out
Week one of trying to get a shoutout
I went to gas station I want to go get some bubble gum but then when I got my bubble gum I realize that it was a bouncy ball they mixed there gum with BALLS
Me at the start hoping she was going to put gum it it  Me getting stressed 😫   Also me being so happy when I head she was putting in gum 🍬
Moriah are u left handed? I never noticed that xD
Moriah when are you going to do a Q&A
Now im craving bubble gum ;-;
i love your effort that you put onto the videos you make
Omg THIS IS AMAZING!
You should actually get a pet fish and actually make it into a fish tank
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. (Credit to Charlie Dog, This was his/her original comment.) <3

Wow!🌈
12:39 oh it's dance of the sugar plum fairy again
Moriah has this magic that whenever she paints something, it becomes something very impressive and extraordinary.
Chick:hi I am chick I am not here Moriah:oh hi chick

WHERE DID YOU GET DAT SHIRT                 I want it 😤
Hey moriah can you do another art things to do when bored. Obviously I know videos take time and you have other plans but maybe in the next 2 months.
has anyone watched stranger things
Freaking love it 👌
Umm... Are you taking a break from rainbow because I don't want you to
I KNEW IT WAS A GUMBLE MACHINE!!!
Wow literally everyone guessed that she was gonna paint on a gumball machine in her story where she gave a biggggg hint
Moriah is painting a bubblegum machine  And here is me with braces who can’t have it
Aight what CAN'T you give a makeover😔❤️
Moriah is totally and yes totally kidcore :>
Whats better than cristmas?  Answer: when Moriah posts a new video!
Omg i looooooove your shirt.
PINK IS NOT A COLOUR IN THE RAINBOW
Hii
Q.When is your birthday?
Yes I know I'm very late,but I'm kinda new so give me chance.
Her jumper at the start omg im in love 😍😍😍
For the inside part, you could try to use some coloured tape or sticky foil?
Only ogs can remember her hand intro ♥️     👇
The fact the Moriah hasn’t painted a wall yet..... copy paste this if you want moriah to paint a wall in her art room too..
Every Friday is like Christmas to me because Moriah posts!
I think the one she painged will attract kids more at the grocery store
I guess the whole world who wants to see “Painting On Rubber Ducks”
Can you do a diamond painting?
I love this so much but I hate the red gum hole. It kinda throws me off. I am sure it would be hard to paint but at least like a solid white would have been better than the red. No hate tho.
Oh I’m 26 what’s your point... same here .... I’ll be 27 in February.
Wow☆im so early
Guys I think if she painted the black metal part in the front white it will look cuter, do you think so?
Bubblegum and rainbows...WHAT WILL COME NEXT??!!!!??!! 😂😂😂😂😂❤️💜💖💙
I want that bubblegum machine ❤️❤️
Plz paint on rubber ducks
Omg it's so prettyyy!!!
I think the name of the dragon fly is cute it's Rosie but I think sprinkles is a cute name for her to...WAIT ... you can name her Rosie and her last name sprinkels

How many times did you call it a bubblegum machine it's a gumball machine lol
Moriah: BUT tHen I nOtIcED- *awkward pause* Ad: COLOURFUL POM POMS!

Colours give life to anything 🎨🖌️❤️

I love your jumper so much and I love you so much:D
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. (Credit to Charlie Dog, This was his/her original comment.) <3
I wait for her video to come every week and always be very happy to see her new creation
This is a weird video idea, but you could buy a huge doll house with all the furniture and people and customize the outside and rooms :D (Day 1)

I love the color of the bubble gum machine is so very colourful love you Moriah ❤️❤️
Is she drawing with her left hand?
Penny ~ 2 bubblegums Quarter ~ 2 bubblegums No money ~ 3 bubblegums  Lol it’s like it’s telling u I don’t want ur money
is it just me who didnt notice any of the background changes until moriah pointed them out
Amazing. I wish I could  do that with my mini jelly belly one. You are so talented. I know it takes TONS of time AND PAINT but it looks AMAZING! 🤩😍
Everyone guessing that she will paint on a gum or something Me: I know whatever she paints will be amazing and related to rainbows😂😂
Please paint coasters!
Hey Moriha! If your not happy with the red, you should paint the glasspart of it like so Moriha will see
#bubblegumforlife
who wants to see moriah painting a rubix cube with one of her character on each box. Copy and paste this comment as much as you guys can so moriah can see it
Why did i just noticed that she's left-handed
ITS ADORABLE I wish it was for sale
How many people want to see her painting on a suitcase👇🏼
Who else wants another bake with me video?       Just me? Ok...
I like it but... That blende 😂 it looks like that shell
I think that you should color the thing where the bubbles gum come out of white it would’ve been a lot better and the color would not tip out because you’re calling the white paint outside not inside✨🤍
Me. Just watching the video Her. Found a cent I got a discount!! Me. Um okay?
Never realised how unsanitary bubblegum machines are.
I Lowe zour autfit  :3
WHERE IS THE SLIRP WHEN YOU OPEN THE WHITE PAINT 😢
It's the gesso that never ends
I got the fluffy pickle socks and they are so nice and comfy
My grandma has that exact same bubble gum thingy and I just open the top and steal all the gumballs from it-
i have an idea for a video, A squishy makeover but instead of a squishy its one of the notebooks with a squishy cover so like a squishy makeover but you give a squishy notebook a makeover   love you chennel 💕♥💕
This is how much people wants to eat some of the bubble gum 👇
Loves the jumper
Hi Moriah can you open the last mystery box love your vids 💜💙✨

i am sorry moriah but today i aint  feeling to watch this vedio
Aaaaaa
I want one of these
Wow!!!!! Gumball machines are my favorite!! My son found a little gumball machine necklace for me last year, and I hung it on my mirror in my car. I love you Moriah, thank you for this video❤🧡💛💚💙💜
That screeching sound actually kind of thing I don’t like it sounds like a scratching plate and that horrible sound
"You may notice I didn't include Pickle,Derp or Georgie..."  Me: *Gasp*
Oop the way she hit her arm
OMG! Who wants to see these kind of machines in the stores?
Is somebody waiting for rubber duck makeover?
NOW SHE'S TWENTY SIX AND SHE WORKS IN AN OFFICE
Love you so much ❤️you make my day 😍I love your video so awesome  and  amazing 💙and happy new year
I got interrupted watching moriah by an ad that has moriah in
I love it 😻 🌟🌟🌈🌈✨✨❤️❤️
All I see is rainbows you closes rainbows
I wish I could do stuff like you I i’m a lonely so and so
Ok I’m back after a year
Moriah: ok, no more sound effects. Moriah editing:  * deep voice sound affect * thank you!
“Me wants to trace” - Moriah Elizabeth 2021
I wonder what she has done with all that gum?🤔
I love gum!!!
Am i the only one who thought the machine was like tiny tiny just coz of the thumbnail?   Just me being stupid? ok makes sense
Can u do more cooking videos?
Who else thinks that the green dinosaur in the video looks a bit like Alfhys from Undertale (Probably spelled the name wrong)
DUDE THIS IS SO COOOLLLLL!!!!!!!
People are *SMART* cause she added a story and people (her fans) guessed it right away that she was going to paint on a bubble gum machine... *smart cookies* ....
Open all the bags of gum,organize by colour, take the time to spiral stack them in rainbow order inside the glass next time you do a locked in my art room challenge. Sure to kill a lot of time and have a very satisfying pay off.
You are born for the art world
If you didn’t notice her reflection in the glass until she pointed it out say “Noticed but Not.”
I AM SO SAD I ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED ON THE VIDEO'S END WHEN I JUST STARTED I AM SO MAD I SPOIL3D THE VIDEO FOR MYSELF

Just asking do u have a channel just for vlogs like bout ur life  ? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
I live your jumper we’re did you get it
I have an extremely obnoxious video Idea for Moriah. Make clay balls the size of bubblegum balls and paint on all of them. You could add prompts, for a nice twist on video’s in the future. Or just pretty decorative pieces. You would be able to do a 24 hour video with that I bet ;)
I thought she would say Gumball Machine not Bubble Gum, i ain't hatin just saying it the way i Do
Attendance for everyone who wants to see “Painting On Her Cabinets And Drawers”😆🌚 PLUS: There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit.

HOW DID I MISS THIS VIDEO?
*hi* *i* *love* *moriahs* *videoes*
Moriah:all done! *Scratches the paint* Me:Why........
Ohhhh I love this! Gumball machines always allow for such creative ideas, it's always fun to see! :D I hadn't thought about painting on the glas, but it looks really colourful 🌈
I would be happier than ever to have that much bubblegum
Moirah just return the bubble gum packages 🤣
This is my favorite, out of all of the videos I’ve seen so far! Also, thank you for sharing 💕 I love your channel! Your video are so relaxing to watch and filled with such good humor ☺️
I knew it was a gum machine!
I know she is such an amazing artist
The ohanna adventure has one of the same gumball machines wouldn’t it be cool if she customized theirs as a collab
Wait instead of bleeding could you add the colors together so like a pink and orange one and a orange and yellow one  Could you do that or would it make it look bad
She put smaller bubblegum in there so multiple came out.  PS. Love you 😘
Where do  you find all your clothes
I did art while listening to your video
Moriah: My ice-smor-nut cat Me: What is that name made out of again?
U are so freaking talented 😍
If it doesn’t work just put pompoms in there!
TEA SET!- I- you should paint a Tea set
Omg omg you have 5 and half more bags of bubble gum pls give it to me.... pls 😂😂
Please EVERYONE WHO READS this please copy and paste this if you want Moriah to make mates for pickle, cousin derp, and the colorful butterfly dragon
That’s so pretty 😍
Oh my god it's my first time seeing you making a video 18 hours ago
RANDOM PERSON AT MORIAH'S HOUSE: Oh, do u have kid's (looking at her filming room) Moriah: No why? RANDOM PERSON: oh the why do u have a kids room.... Moriah: Thats my room person: O-O (Also I love you, you're awesome and you feel us kids YOURE A KID IN AN ADULT'S BODY!!!!!)
Now I want gum🥲🥲
I did not even see her reflection when she was taking it apart. but after she said it i noticed it ans cracked up.
who thinks that she should paint tiny balls of all her characters and put them in it and each year take one ball and do a give away
Hey, since you have a lot of bubblegum left. Maybe do a bubblegum giveaway! Perhaps the challenge could be: Submit your craziest story ( Maybe it’s bubblegum based or something) the winner with the funniest/craziest story wins a bag of Bubblegum ( If u do end up doing this, maybe make it 1 submission not a hundred so it’s equal) Trust me, when I saw all that bubblegum I was like 😧😧 me likey 🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅
I am triggered that the gum hole  is red as well
Can i have the rest of the buble gum 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂
I think you have to take a break from 🌈 rainbow
Moriah: the VERY RANDOM collection of colours <a bit later> also Moriah: and so that ties in to the RAINBOW background
Did you guys notice she rarely asks us to sub or like or comment or anything While others force us to do that 😂😂
it is so PRETTYYYY
2025- R.I.P. gesso :(
Wow!!
I am a fan but I am sad bc I am going bad to school and wanted your bag but I could not get it bc I live in Australia and you don’t ship here 😔
This is the song that doesn’t end.   Yes, it goes on and on, my friends. Some people started singing it  Not knowing what it was, And they’ll continue singing it Forever, just because...   This is the song that doesn’t end.   Yes, it goes on and on, my friends. Some people started singing it Not knowing what it was, And they’ll continue singing it Forever, just because...(repeat)
Me and my friends think you should do more mango designs he was so popular!
I love this channel it's so satisfying
Moriah....       U R THE BEST UTUBER EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR          i also really love when u do makeovers!❤️
It’s so cute I love it
woooooooooowwww
Love your videos I subscribed your channel you can also make a gum ball machine squishy or draw a gum all themed animal love the machine thank you
That is the *best* and *cutest* bubble gum machine I've *ever seen*
I love youuuu
Hey moriah! Go to nerdecrafter’s channel and you will see her reviewing ur merch, ALL HOLIDAY MERCH!
4:48 "and the little ridges? kind of annoying to work with, uieh it just made it that much trickier to get an even blend"       and now kids, what have we learned? *moriah doesnt like challenges.*    also who wants to see moriah creating a squishy version of nelson?
Oh it is a fun object
Its sooooo gooood!!!
Me waching this at 10:00am
Wow you make my day🤗
I really want to see her re-painting and decorating a doll house I’ve seen a lot of people doing it lately and I think she’d be really good at it but of course she would have to split it into different parts.
Bc of all the editing, I alway have to laugh when she is doing it. It’s just awesome, u know what I mean?
Are you left handed
Next video she just reashes back turns the thing and grabs bubble gum in the middle of a sentence
I was hoping you would decorate the penny as well. 😟it wanted a little rainbow too. Add it to the end of next weeks video or something as a bonus or make a side bonus video dedicated to the penny that snuck along with the bubble gum machine
I think it would be funny to watch how moriah tries to eat as many bubble gums as she can, and then make a big bubble
Btw your ment to spin the top which is the red bit
That's adorable!!!!!!! The characters on the glass makes me feel nostalgic for this really run down children's arcade that closed down a long time ago. It must have been built in the 90's or early 2000's bc there was a SUPER old balloon machine that had pokemon on it and Played route 1 music as it inflated the balloon. The gumball machine makes me imagine how cool it must have looked when it was still new.
I knew she worked hard but I never expected her to work that hard
Thank you  apu💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Burt needs therapy 😅
I- LOVE YOUR SWEATER!!!
Moriah I’ve got the exact same bubble gum machine which is the exact same size too
Imagine all of Moriah's squishies come to life 😳
GUYS MS. MORIAH NAMED A THING!!!  Its called "Bad art"  (no offense i mean She named it not made it)   2:10 How do you get that magic tool?
I was about to comment about the gum hole not being painted, then she said she didn't want it to be painted!!! *triggered*
It looks so cool!!
Hey can you plz do a squishy rating with all your squishys plz
I love this series you should do more of these  It’s my favourite one
If you wanted you could paint on top of the glass where the gum drops so you don’t see the red
gORGIEEE
I wish Nelson was an upgrade to one of the Among us game character design of 'lime'.😆
Hahaha the gum on each character is in rainbow order 😆
Hello friend
eLLoo:>
I love her vids and I think everyone should to like 24/7😎😀💋
I am such a big fan and you probably. Wont read this.Anyways i love want you made and inspired me.
SHE SOUNDS LIKE PLAGY AT 10:18 ... a bit.. i guess..  (plagg from miraculous)
Can you please post more squishy roasting videos, because I really miss them ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Moriah should make a squishy of the Dalmatian in a the dragon fruit she hasn’t said anything about that character in a while I think it’s really cute like if you agree
OMG I love her jumper
I love you 💕💕💜😍😍😍❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Ello
Moriah check needecrafter's video she bought your merch and did a review.
Who else loves nelson: please make him into a squishy xx Also, I thought she was gonna paint ON the gum lol
Hi
Yas I saw that story you made I guessed it!
*can we just talk about the people who said she was gonna PAINT ON GUM when she posted a little spoiler-*
Fyi in the description it said your 25
moraia plz do more sqwshe make over
Have you tired using those triangular makeup sponges to blend colour gradients? I think it would definitely make it easier
i love you moriah plz love me back!
Am I blind or did one of them not get a bubble gum! Or I’m just crazy and  his body is bubble gum?
Big Fan from India
I literally can’t WAIT till next week. Does anyone have a time machine I can borrow? 😂
I'd be tempted to paint the 'dark grey mechanism part' ivory with gold accents, but then again I have no idea of how much is too much.
Week 2 of asking you to make a HUMAN YOU LIVE SIZE squishy
Do a squishy makeover next week please
Wait-   can I have it?
Ive watched you for years i love you mariah
I can’t wait for Moriah to hit 6 million she really deserves it she entertains a lot of people as well as making them laugh she has an amazing personality and is awesome at art. I love that all of the different characters have their different ways with their gum balls
Omg when she said the cats name was Lucy before that I was like Lucy would be a good name and then I was like OMG
Hi I’m a champion subscriber
That  is an amazing  bubblegum  machine  Moriah  Elizabeth. I love your videos .  Love Honey  Rose  age  8.
Can you do a makeover on a backpack!?🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥳🤩🥳🤩🤩
I loved the all the characters on it and I like how she gave all of the characters that didn’t have names before now they have names

moriah for the inside you could put in some coloured paper
Me: *first watches this video on my tv but the thumbnail wasn't loading in so I had no idea what she was painting*  Her: *Pulls out a gumball machine*  Me: *checks to see how long the video is*  14:17 The amount of editing you must have went through-
Everyone : watching the video Me : Remembering that one Tom and Jerry episode where Tom fed Jerry a glue covered gum ball...XD
Moriah Elizabeth  Moriah Elizabeth Moriah Elizabeth Let's see if this works
does anyone else love the way Moriah always wonders if gesso actually does anything yet she always uses it just in case

I AM your. Big fan of you
oh my god i love it does anyone else really want this to be made merch ?
*Imagine she paints on paint*
But where did her money go 😯😦
Ooooh can you imagine a 80s themed gumball machine, that would be soooo cute
I really like it
The fact thatI don't recognise it as a bubble gum dispenser but one for rubber balls...
That’s such a good design! You inspired me to get a sketchbook and actually practice art! You never fail to amaze me!
Why did u paint on the glass!😭😭😭
wooow..... it was kind of predictable when she gave the clue but i was like NAAAAAAAW SHES NOT GONNA MAKE IT THAT EASY TO GUESS but no......
The cat looks like a Miranda to me! Like if you agree. 7:06

Can you do a mooring routine
hey u kan prank pepol by saying they need to use  money to get bubble gum , but aculy you dont end u just get free money lol
A
Epic🥰🥰🥰
They look amazing like WOW 🤩
You're art is soOo BOOTIFUL and CuTe!!
The last time I was this early was when Iida slapped Midoriya
You should do a posca pens giveaway for when you hit 6m!
<£ it so muchhhhhhhhhhhh
For me the hardest decision is if I should outline my drawings in black or to just leave it
omg you and gloom are about to hit 6 mil!
You know she has all the colors if the rainbow in gumball, if she wanted to be really extra, you can take all 8 bags sort them into colors, put them in general rainbow order and boom more somewhat unnecessary rainbows but who cares.
why did i feel like she was gonna do an among us character?
YOU named the icesmorecat lucy which is my sisters name and then you did the sloth which is funny because my sisters favourite animal is a sloth
Literally every comment: omg I didn't even notice the background changed until she pointed it out   Me: so how do I spell behavior
Yes it goes on and on my friend
I got pickle
Moriah : don't ask about it you wouldn't understand  Me: its... I don't.. what?????
OMG SO PRETTY
plz do more baking videos they are soo much funny
If it doesn't work maybe you could put multicoloured pompoms in it! Theyll looks so cute like bumble gums. Like this so she can see this! 😛😛😛
call one izzy or whizzy
The bubblegum machine looks soo cute with all of the characters  I really loved the scared 😱 chicken🐥
Moriah thinks she is such a bad artist but she is literally the best artist on youtube  ♥
Moriah: which means I still have 5.5 packs of bubble gum left me: actually, it's 4.5 left
Her in other videos: I should stop using rainbow themed stuff Also her: *makes it rainbow*
no one: literally no one: not a single soul: Me: *click like button before even watching the video*
Xzfgh
oh my gosh...I think this is my favorite thing you've ever painted. This is amazing!! I love the way th characters pop from the bubblegum, and that you decided to keep the base pretty subtle. Absolutely beautiful work as always, Moriah (and Im possibly out to buy a bubbegum machine for myself to paint on ) XD
Who else also loves Moriah's singing?
The scared chicken: gah! huh ahh! Wha! Me: *laughs....a lot
Fun fact: I once went to this place and in the waiting room they had an m&m dispenser that was broken and that day I got cups full of chocolate
I loveeeee the look of it also if it had Skittles in there I would use it everyday but can anyone imagine moriah doing a bake with me video secreting the gumball machine  its kinda a bit of a dumb idea but I think it would be cool to see what would happen if she tried 😀😅
can we appreciate she uses her own memes in every video
I.LOVE.ITTTTTTTT!!!!!!
Ooh I got a discount 😂really made me laugh
Wait I just noticed you draw left handed .. 😦
This is a YouTube funny talented and. Over all just the best I love you
It’s like I knew you were gonna do Patel colours
Moriah HIGH FIVE!!!! I am left handed
Wow that was awesome, at one point we were worried in which direction it was going but man you out did yourself!!!  Well done.
Moriah's search history: *Does bubblegum expire*
OMG YES THE WEEK END!
7:50 yasssssss
Pretty pretty please do this ok so you can make a squishy house and you're and the house is going to be made out of squishies and everything your food your bathroom everything every room in the house I will be squishy
#picklethedinosaur
She saying : this took me for.. Me: 4 hours right? She continues : for ever!! Me: uhh , did something happened?
lol, Read the description  "pisode"  😂😂😂
Lemme say I luv her jumper / sweater
Wow, Moriah, this is amazing! I LOVE IT!!!
this is probably the best thrift makeover in moriahs  series
IT'S CALLED A GUMBALL MACHINE
Seriously .. This video was the best I've seen this week love you
i always dance on her intro😂 i love it so much..dont change it ever 😂❤️
I KNEW IT I KNEW SHE WOULD PAINT A GUMBALL MACHINE I SAW HER TIK TOK/TOK TIK AND SHE ATE A GUMBALL AND I SAID GUMBALL MACHINE YESS I CALLED IT I CALLED IT k me calm down
I love all your videos. See you next week. Bye.
can you give a hint to what next weeks video is about pls ?
You should put tiny little crafts inside!
The reason it was dispensing mutiple gumballs, is because you got the wrong size gumball for that machine 😅  Seven bags of wrong size gumballs is even better 🤣

i want bubble gum
"it's kind of......... ✨u n i q u e✨
Omg I love Nelson
Moriah: it's going to be intense, brace yourself!  Advert: hI! wHAt aRE yOu WAtcHINg?
Where is bake with me?
I watch literally every video of yours and I love everything you create and how much you love your art babies. I want a bubble gum machine now 🥰
3:20   The little laugh at the end 👌
Omg u should try 5 minute craft hacks and rate them! :O
I would like to see an art challenge where rainbow is forbidden. It could be interesting. Also I love your videos😆😆😆😃😃
yasss i saw ur post yesterday in instagram and i knew u will costomize a bubble gum mechice wow i cant spell
The table is a demonic murderer of elbows
I thought you were sneaking in another rainbow with the background colors because at the beginning of the second coat there was a pink background for the pink bubble gum and a yellow background for the yellow bubblegum
How about painting the flap on the machine so you can't see the red??
Its a gumball machine isn't it?Anyhoo it looks sooo cool!!
I’m scared off that hole too
It gives you 3 because you bought the small bubble gum and the hole inside is big so more than 1 will fall. If you bought the bigger ohes you would get 1.
Moriah:awww you see my reflection  Meh: see’s Meh: omg did she just cover her arm infront of her reflection 😂😂😂😂😂😂
SQUISHY MAKEOVER NOWWWWWWWWW!!!thank you 😊 💓
=O What an artist
At first the painting on the glass looked like a pure mess but at the end it looks amazing! 😀
YES PLEASE DO PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS
the people that disliked are just mad they cant paint a bubblegum machine as good as Moriah
Can everyone just stop and realize moriah is touching all that yuck stuff on the gumball machine
Item: SCP(whatever the next SCP number is) or The Unlimited Gesso Class: safe Special containment: This SCP should be contained in a small 2x3x5 room and 1 unarmed guard.
Hi Moriah pls can you do a 'Fixing My Squishies: Giant Edition'
Ahh so cute & creative! Love it as always!

Im from finland abd i love your videos abd your style ❤️
Moriah: I order 7 more bags of bubble gum .12:43 Me: it is only me notice that is not 7 bags but 8 bags of bubble gum😆  Leave a like if you guys saw it 👇
Leave it in the room so you can have a snack when you paint and film!! It turned out so cute
I THINK THE MONSTER FARTING IS DISTRBING!!!
I love moriya she the best

moriah: oh look you can see my reflection well thats distracting me: trys to look at her reflection for the rest of the video* lol  idk
I knew it would be a gum ball machine by the hint that u posted!
He outside of any
I looked it up and posca pens are created to (try to) be used on any surface. Including glass :)
Did anybody else think she was gonna use glass paint like in her painting things for 24 hours video, or was it just me?
13:14 the colour of the bubble gum matches her nail polish :0
Yasss i guessed it! <3
I have that same one! They arent made like that anymore (kids are stupid thats why). Modern ones have plastic. My brother had it and I got it for Christmas one year. So yeah, great find for such a cheap price!
Moriah, your awesome! I wish I was as good as a drawer as you.... You inspire me! I wanna be like you!
I love that so much You should do a colab with Chloe rose art check out her channel you too are not a like but she loves art and she uses some of the same products as you
You even draw on the glass the bubblegum in range of colors in no particular order 😂
hi
Like if we should get Moriah to 6M to surprise her
Fun fact: everyone is saying fun fact lol I am too wait I just said it two timeesss

She says she’s 26 yet the description still says 25? 🤔
Not me literally having the same thing. Like. The exact thing. From an op shop. That ive wanted to customise 🥴👉👈

Wow
I knew it was a gum ball machine 😂
Am i the only one who doesn't realize the background color changed until moriah points it out?
Wow lovely!! Good job I’m a big fan

Moriah: me wants to trace Me: wut, why u talking like a baby?
Wow I love this 😍 now I wanna do this!
Yes im 11 hours earlly
I’m sad she didn’t do something with pickle I bought a plush just 3 days ago
Did you see those pink and green gum balls? Girl Cosmo and Wanda snuck into ur gumball machine
I'm sorry, the cat needs to be Coco or Marsha or both somehow. Y'know, like chocolate and marshmallows?  ..... NVM, I'll leave now, it was just an idea🤣
Who wants it and the bubblegum to be in her shop because I would buy it
Your edits kill me🤣
Who wants to see moriah making a dream catcher and also love u moriah
I had the same sort machine when I was a kid! It looked just like this one!
I only noticed the background change when she said it
MORIAH YOU PAINTED THE DRAGON WRONG ITS BELLY IS MISSING ITS RAINBOWS
I’m just gonna say what everyone is thinking        Can you put this is your shop at a time maybe before may (no particular reason🤫)
Ahem. SOMEONE GIVE HER SOME BUBBLE GUM AND A PAT ON THE BACK.

CAN I HAZ IT???
10 hours late 😭😭😭 i wanted to come early, at least im not 3 years or 3 month's, orrrr a week late :) (I love your vids)

Can you please do needle felting? By the way your videos are amazing👍👍
I would love for her to paint an entire room
Hi
da way she hit her elbow , lol
Oh that elbow on the table sounds sore
How do u make ur pastel blue and purple so bright?
The way the color of the gumballs match the color of her nails at 13:14 is quite satisfying.
I love this

The reason of why you are so afraid of the hohl is couse you probably have trypophobia
"Been Marinating in My Mind" Quote of the year
U get more for *free* then u get from to *pay*  Gumbal machine 2021
I would love one of those because when I’m doing art I can just grab a gumball and have an endless supply of gum
Thank i needed break from minecraft story, simping for ppl who will likely never know me, and making danganronpa references. Brain hurt.
No hate but there are 7coulers in the rainbow red not pink and indigo
That was really interesting and amazing!!!💜
If you inflated a balloon inside the jar, you might have been able to press the drawings against the glass tightly enough to make "utilising the transparent nature of the substrate" easier 😄
Yassss we need her to paint on rubber DUCKSSSSSS
Love the look of bubblegum machines, and yours is the best yet!
I’m sorry but your videos are getting boring because you always do rainbows please change it up plz plz I love you
please do a squishy makeover with the giant panda. you can turn it into the  plushie you made in your collab with Jackie
I live for her editing
You're in a candy crush ad?
Moriah's Gesso should be an SCP  SCP: The Never Ending Gesso
Please  make a video on custom caRd set (Put your own characters on them such as pickle  , cousin derp , Gorgie , speckles , strawbeary , etc ) anyway im a subscriber  and probably  one of your biggest follower or supporter

✨
"the song that doesn't end" reference love that!
oh gosh few days ago i was thinking about moriah painting a gum ball machine and today when i saw the vid i was like oh shit. love u moriah stay blessed
I LOVE NELSON OMG!
Moriah: and now I have five bags of bubble gum laying around :/ Me: since when is that a bad thing?!
I think this is my favourite thrift store makeover
I luv ur shirt!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
3:22😂😂
I legit tought you gonna paint Bubbles gum lmao
Question: Can you paint a crown rainbow with Pickle on the side of the crown? ;w; ( It would look really good on you )
12:44 these are 8 bags😂
I really love this design!😍 You really need to get a high quality airbrush kit for such projects. It would make doing gradients on even awkward shaped surfaces SO much easier! (Not to mention faster)  I actually found one which in addition to the normal metal paint holding tank...actually has multiple PLASTIC paint holding tanks for the airbrush. Which allows you to just turn the sprayer upside down, remove the paint holder & put on another...allowing you to quickly & EASILY change colors! Which fixes one of the drawbacks of using an airbrush for some projects. Having multiple tanks can also help when you are making custom colors for a project. Or another option for custom mixed colors is you can mix your colors in resealable little glass or plastic jars/pots & use a dropper to put it in the airbrush as needed...or you can buy squeeze bottles like the paint comes in for long term storage. I use both methods when I either have a LOT of space to cover or if I am doing multiple art pieces over several days with the same colors.  There are just SO MANY colors, finishes, additives, etc for use in airbrushes now it’s unreal. I think it would be awesome to see you use one.❤️
Lol
Omg I’m eeeeeeeeeeeaaaasaarrrrrrrrrlllllyyyyyy!!!!
I realized that moriah is just using her left wow -
Hi
Noone:   Me: WhEn YoU wIlL pAiNt ThE dUcKs?? If you see this YOU HAVE TO PAINT ONE LIKE GEORGIE!

When Moriah used gum as her clue I thought she was gonna use gum to do art 🤦🏽‍♀️
I think the ghost of the cupcake will haunt her forever
One of my subscribers suggested that I should do a collabo with you. After seeing your channel, I must say it would be AWESOME!
WE NEED DUCKS
It's kinda..... uniqie
hi Moriah, just a math correction, 2 and a half plus 5 and a half makes 8, not 7 :)
Yo
I'm so so happy because it was released on my birthday, and I loved it so much! Thank you Moriah for your big gift ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I am the only one who likes to casually like every comment.....    Oh ok only me... 😅
Love how sh3 says weapon and not art thing LIKE BRUH
Moriah, almost 6M!! Where you going to record the numbers, or do anything special? 😁😁❤️

*rubber duck petition claim your ticket here*
That’s so cool
This is my favorite thrift store makeover so far!
One day in the future you’ll be on the last drops of that gesso and you’ll remember saying                                                                                                                           I’m pretty sure gesso is the same thing as white paint
Now all you have to do is paint each and every gum ball..... 😂😂😂😂
Put tiny squishes in there for cool design.
They should make a store with all of moriah's merch, and they should put a lot of buble gum machine like this one ❤
Her shirt matches the gum ball machine
This is the geso that never ends yes It go's on and on my frend a crazy lady started using it unkoweing what it was and she'll continue using it because.......................
If she reaches 6 million I wanna draw her but no video post : , )  I am a new subscriber lol-
Can you make puppy the pumpkin in a squish or how do you say it
Meh:gum machine you need a make over and I agree with moriah elizbaith
You NEED to put in your poms poms, they look like little bubble gums 🥺
Moria: *paints a rainbow  Me: 😱🤯🙊
Oh.. a bubble gum machine from your bubble story lol
I wish all her memes and stickers would be publicly use able pls
This is The song that never ends yes it goes on and on my friends
Bubblegum give away!!!!!!

I NEED this in my life. It’s BEYOND adorable and honestly gives me so many great memories from when I was a kid.

What I love about Moriah, is that Moriah voice editor makes fun of Moriah artist, and Moriah editor sometimes makes fun of Moriah voice editor
Cool ur so unique
*ATTENTION! WE MUST GET HER TO  MILLION*
Its 2021.You should change your intro
Your a rlly good drawer
Omg i have the exact same one i got it from my grandma who got it at at the thrift store which is kinda weird but cool i hope you notice this comment and also can i get a shout out ily so much
Me  subscribing rightnow
PLEASE DO PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS !!
I’m a new YouTube and I love your videos I hope you one day get a chance to watch my videos and are having a good day
My mum hates gum when I got one 1 year ago I haven't seen it
My brain after she opened the gesso : the never ending gessooooo nah nah nah nah nah nah the never ending gessooooo! 😂 ( If you don't know the movie the never ending story you won't anderstend your missing out on a amazing movie 🎥 )
Who else thinks that the little grey part is an eyesore??
This is incredible! 😍 Its my favorite makeover.💕
PLEASE DO A SERIES WHERE YOU PAINT RUBBER DUCKS!!!!
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Copy and paste let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.)
That came out so amazing. I really loved it. Ur so talented I love it
If you wet the paper it sticks to the glass and you can paint that way, I've done it before on glass... works perfectly!
I wait for every Friday [ Saturday for me as I am in India] if I see it in my feed  I am the happiest person In the world! #happy😊
Fucking beautiful my favorite artwork so far
i think it would be cool if she painted the grey metal knob white and did some cartoony outlining or something. but it still looks so good with it she did such a good job!
Maybe if she puts her diy pins inside it?! 😂❤️
So I was eating cereal and when she said”boy you got a dirty gum hole” I spat my cereal everywhere and started crying I was laughing so hard😂
U should use 6 squishes from the hopeless bin to make one big squishy for six million special
Love you Moriah
Is it just me or no one remembers the rest of mystery boxes 📦 😘😘😘 Love u Mariah ( sorry I meant moriah  autocorrect)
So I'm gessing in America you guys call it Bubble gum but in Canada we just call it gum.😂
Use the gum ball machine as a storage and put small squishes in it
Me when she says I'll see you next week, bye! : "WHYYY A WHOLE WEEEEKKK??????"
We all know before the video that she will color the bubblegum machine rainbow...
There are some YouTubers I watch and I put their videos in the “watch later” list when they post, but I always watch yours as SOON as I see them 🥰
Idea Buy ping pong balls and paint them all pirdy like and put them inside
Plz do tie dye
3:21 is just: *mwa* beautifulllll
Moriah : "🎵🎵It’s the gesso that never ends.....🎵🎵 huaaaaa " Me : falls down from my bed😂😂😂 congratulation  6 million subs
U should make mini squishy gumball with cute faces and put it inside
Love this.   So cute
I love her sweater soooooooo muchhhhhhh........
I pinky swear this was before she painted it I really think it is rainbow
Rubik's cube Rubik's cube Rubik's cube Rubik's cube pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease like if you agree
I love your sweater 😍😍😍
My sister has the literal exact same bubble gum machine 😬😳😱🤯🙊
Omg ur so close to 6M I just realized I have been here when u were at 2M! Can’t wait to celebrate!
I'm starting to wonder why I tune in when I can already tell before I click on the video whats gonna happen...welcome back to another episode of painting things rainbow...
here is some video ideas if you ever run out: only painting on donut squishies. only painting on rubber ducks. only painting on narwhal squishies. only painting on apple squishies. only painting on ice cream squishies (big and small).  only painting on milk squishies. only painting on popcorn squishies. only painting on cace squishies. only painting on poop squishies. only painting on cupcake squishies. only painting on burger squishies. only painting on cakeroll squishies. and laslty only painting on pancakes.
You should probably paint your gesso container ✨°o°
oh my gosh- she called the sloth burt and my kitten is named burt :D
Moriah Elizabeth I wish for you to see this https://youtube.com/shorts/U2j53NmDh5E  Trust me it has gorge in it and it may be a little tutorial 😊 It would mean the world if you saw this (the person that made the vid is NOT me)
You know you could use a sponge to blend it easily right. All you do is put the amount of paint on it and let it sit there for a few seconds then you start to blend simple yet easy. Btw I love your videos even tho I’m never going to get noticed
Epic
You should paint a bunch of costume cuties like how you painted a bunch of bear bread
Noice👌👌
U need to CLEAN stuff when u GET stuff from the STORE or else COVID-19 :P
You should make bubble gum art
You know you could have made it a crystal ball Fortune teller machine looking like Gumball machine to.................. except that pastel Rainbow and tired of you painting that sorry but just giving a suggestion
please do making paper squishy 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
God I love that sweater😍
I'm redecorating my room and now I HAVE to paint a gumball machine for it omg
Pretty cool but I think the inside should be white so the colourful gumball pop when they are there... Also... The metall color should be gold/silver because this metall colour is ugly :0
Hello I love u pls reply and can u do a whole table pls?
I have that same gumball machine
I literally have that same exact gumball machine in my room right now!!!
I thought I met u at Walmart I live in Oklahoma and I literally saw a twin just like u but idk if it u
I have a baby gum ball machine! I painted it pastel and painted the plastic part that’s clear white with pastel gum balls  And the base color for the red part was blue with white flicked on
Teach me how to blend plz
I thought she was going to paint the metal part
I always love to see what she comes up with 😊❤️👍🏼She is sooo creative
Yes i just watch your story' now i understand.
BRUH when she said but ill be doing and then a ad comes up and says tonight is eating ruffle fries and it was a uber eats ad XD
You are really annoying.............I like it 😏
This was so good!! Such a cool transformation!
Love it!!
I looooovvvvvvveeeeee her shirt it is sooo cute
you should of put a face in black so the color of gum will be the back
I mailed something to u did it come?
You should totally do a Glass Painting challenge, like the anime ones but with more characters of yours 💜
Omg its sooo lovely,❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’ve been through the art frustration journey for a few years now- I have improved from her videos
Who else is scrolling through the comments during the video
I think more is coming out than it’s supposed to because it’s the wrong size of gumball 😳
Moriah, your clothing is sooo beautiful, cheerful and bright!!! (opposite to my dark soul)
But I know mostly every time you post you at least say it  once a video

Congrats on kinda 6mil

The only thing that bothers me is where the bubble gum is gonna come out like the entrance or- you know what I mean but I know its hard to paint it so I'm not forcing moriah in doing it
Hello fellow adult here age 29 I absolutely love this you did such a wonderful job although I do feel you could come up with the creative solution to fix the red on the inside of the door maybe a piece of paper also would love for you to spray paint the silver mechanism on the front it's just so dull compared to your beautiful artwork. Anyways that's  just a few of my thoughts but honestly this is so creative and came out so good I'm running out tomorrow to buy my own and give it a try
PLEASE CAN YOU PAINT A RUBBER DUCKS???? ILYSM
EEeEJKeE “sounds like a squeaky sound”
Rosie isn't doing anything with a bubble?????
VIDEO IDEA: living a day in my life based off of squishies. for example, for what to eat moriah could randomly chose a squishy from the food bin and for desert she could do the same thing but with the desert bin.. what do you all think?
OMG! That looks fantastic, I like rainbows (not too much though, sorry) but i looooooooove this makeover! Great job, Moriah!
I love you moriah elizabeth
Omg yay I didn’t know she was left handed!! Yessss leftiesss!
Hey I found your bubblegum machine on amazon like what it looked like before u painted it
Love ur vids!!!!
is it really clean??
i love your art love this peace
Cna you do a house tour
instead of just painting the jar you can out mini character thingies in the jar and when u put a coin one. Maybe u can do this if u get a bigger jar.
I LOVE rainbows so painting rainbows is a-okay most of us don't bite.
Is this the thing you were excited for?
Moriah :me want's to trace . Me:me want's bubble gum 😂😂
Ayooo Moriah is gonna hit 6 million Congrats 💞
I like were the gum balls fall staying red, it pops in the rainbow to me. Also sence the red is darker that could help it pop.
I WANT IT!!!!
GIIIRL I HAVE THAT SWEATER
8 hours, 1M Congrats, that’s sssniperwolf level
I look superr cute
If you do something like this again you wet the paper down 😉
i 😍your vids
Moriah I just want to say that I am very sick like my nose is closed and throat is like PAINING but when I watch your videos I feel very cheered up and better ☺️🙂
My nick name is luci ☺️
Wow it's gorgeous 😍✨❤
you done so good i love it💓😊
*that just looked like a screeching sound* -Moriah Elizabeth  2021
I've missed u so much. my mental health has been bad- still is 😣👹 but I'm glad to see YouTube recommend your channel to me again🤗❤🥺
Plz do bake with me part 8 plz plz plz
Hey I doubt you’ll see this but can you try to crochet a plushie of Georgie maybe I’m a big fan lol God bless you
Tip: when cleaning things with dead cells use an old toothbrush. It gets into the crevices and helps to get all the free dead cells out.
Love this!
You are so talented and you make everyone laugh in every video and if there are haters out there that are just jealous of you because of how amazing you are 🥰
O
Yeah
Moriahh someone said that posca pens can be mixed when you add a little bit of water.
Take your ticket for here before 6 mil subs here  |  |
Poor scared chicken. Everyone got a name except for him.
Moriah i hope its gum it looks like boggers   Me. I know it ear wax j
Am I the only one that never notice like ever the backgrounds changing?😂
3:11
No one :  Literally no one :  Moriah : Almost every painting  has the ugly duckling symdrome 😂😂😂
Can you pleeease do a live video 🙏
that unpainted gum hole tho-- ig you shouldn't really touch that unless your wiping it
Always Love u..😙 Love from India
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
I hEaRt CaNdY!
THIS IS YOUR BEST THRIFT STORE MAKE OVER IM OBSESSSEEEDDDD
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Copy and paste let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.)
moriah i have a idea for a  video, u  sould do a  video about u and opey painting because den we can see him lahy down in the painting and not like a want dat to happen hehe and what was the last time dat  you did a q&a because that would be funny
I love this! And wow, the horror lurking in those crevices 😱
The cupcake haunts me 😂😭
"Hey, it's me!" wasn't even my favourite catchphrase Moriah actually said in the beginning of each video.
Please do a massive squishy makeover of all the tiny minis and fill the machine with them!!!
Thx so much for posting if it weren’t for u I wouldn’t be able to keep my grip on reality, I think I nearly cried when I realised that your vid had come out!
Omg it looks adorbs I love it!!
I guess it
She should do another bake with me!
xD
Now I know its too late...but what if u had put water on the papers, then they would have stick to the inside of the glass making it easier to trace the pictures...  Stupid idea? Okay I'll leave now.
Attendance for people who think gooey price stickers should be illegal 🙋‍♀️
This is how many times moriah painted in Rainbow  👇🏻👇🏻
Put some stickers or something
No more sound effects me: no more inomonapias
Hey can you do something related to kids or k-pop like bts
It’s so cute💕😅👌
NICE !!!!!!!!!
Hi
please cook again? I love it when you do that!
Dude how are you so talented? I love you💓
So pretty 😍... I love all the cartoon characters..  I love the way she says bad things first bringing down everyone's hope and expectations and then suddenly stating the solution and making her idea work... 😂😂 That's very intelligent..
5:47 : Yes , we are !! And it's funny !!
Please do a recreating squishies into food❤️
Who thinks moriah is Unproffessionally professional?
That’s Adorable! <3! Love your work! Keep all of it up ! :3
Me: oh great it’s a bubble gum machine that she will probably never use.  Moriah : hey it’s me we will be doing a thrift store makeover. Me: I know it’s in the title
Pretty sure it’s a gum ball machine
Omg.. Its so cute. I can watch this over and over.
I never would have thought this day will come
Can anyone appreciate Moriah , on how good she is on giving her own  sound effects 😁😁 *Nice*
Hiii!!! I bought the pickle and derp slippers from your merch shop and they are the best thing in the world!, you should totally buy them
Quick tip to remove gummy/sticky stickers: use baby oil! It helps make the glue less tacky and easier to peel off :3
Moriah : 4:59 : "I'm gonna paint the top hat to match creating the rainbow..... I mean  randomly colourful gradient" ..... 😂😂 Lol   *No one can call it a rainbow , it's randomly colourful gradient .... Ok ?*
Please part 2 make a closet makeover
Hi moraih me and my besties watch you everyday please mension us we are you bigest fans we got wvery single merch what you have. Love you🥰😘
Finally  she is actually using her creation NOTE iam not a hater i have bin with her for 3 year
Poor spider that made the web😭💀 Rip
Moriah like: Im GoNnA dEcOrAtE dIs Me like: doesn't she do that to everything?????
Love your channel so funny lol 😜
Hey thanks for uploading today been real down just got evicted thanks for making this easier :)
Can someone tell me what kind of paint that she used? Cause I used acrylic and those bastards always dried up too quickly beforehand I finished blending
Melvin
I like BURT.
Moriah: those price stickers should be illegal  Me: that sounds like sssniperwolf 😂
Who noticed that she is so close to 6 million subs?
Believe me or not- I've NEVER eaten a gumball ÚnÙ
Her intro reminds me of pudgy saying “owa owa”😂
am i the only one who thinks they're all playing with and blowing farts
You I Love No Kidding And I Love You Love
GORGEOUS but I would of pained the place where the gum comes out white...but love it very much
Cuteeee
Me: watches Mariah's story Also me: ok let's go its saturday she uploaded yesterday ima watch it
I am astonished at the creativity and talent in this piece. I know rainbow and characters are her normal but the way she incorporates the characters into her pieces is amazing!
Yesss I just could not wait for her to post
Everyone knew it, I thought it was a hubba bubba pack
I love the look
SHE GOT RAINBOW BUBBLEGUM
You could really paint anything on like dirt and I would have the best day ever watching you do it
You should make a mosaic with the excess bubble gum
i want this .... can i buy it😍😍
Moriah : 4:20 : In no Particular OrDeR . Me : iT's a Rainbow , and Rainbow has a OrDeR . 🙄🙄 😂😂
You should put Skittles in it
I have the same gumball Machine and I want to paint it now
It’s the excessive blinking for me.....JK love her
ALeGgl
Everyone: Just calm down- Moriah: *pANiKs aNd mAkEs tHe aRt wOrsE* Me: I'd do the same.. (edit: oml thank you so much for the likes)
This is the song that never ends
13:42 - This is so cool! I love the colors. 😁

I love your rainbow sweater! 😮💙 and of course your brand new creation too😊
IT'S NOT A BUBBLE ( BUBBLE ) GUM THERE GUM BALL'S U IDIOTS
Me: sees pickle plush in background also me : huh? That looks familiar... also me again:  stares at pickle hoodie and plush at the end of my bed
I've always called it a gumball machine, but after this, I will always call it a bubblegum machine.
What a surprise she does rainbow!!!!
2:13 VeRy rArE tOoL . wE wOn'T uNdErStAnD iT 😂😂😂😂
I have the exact same gum ball machine but we put m&ms in it
MORAIH SHOULD SO DAIMNOD PAINTING IM DOING MY RN LOL ITS SI MUCH FUN
Who else wants Moriah to paint a wall      Just me ok
I am waiting for the dragon fruit dalmation squishy       Any day now
My name is Lucy and that cat is me is I was a cat
Thanks for inspiring me Because I have a bubble gum machine but Sorry I can't speak But I do have a bubble gum machine So You just inspired me So The but the glass bowl Broke though sooooooooooooooooooooooo
I actually have that same gumball machine
I found out that we have the same birthday
3:24 Terrifying
Moriah : Now what im going to try to do, is utilise the nature of our transparent sub straight  Me : Huh Moriah : In Other words Me Wants To TrAcE Me : Ohhhh I get it...
Am I the only one that felt something when she rubbed her nail across the gesso? Edit: near 3:35
Moriah: “ When’s it’s all going to be put together, it’s going to be intense... brace yourself.”  Me: “ Aren’t all the things you make intense and VERY colorful?”
Your awesome Me
To solve the red thing that botherd you in the front, you can paint the little clear clippy thing white. Then you wont see it anymore
OMG i loveeeeewee you and i have that SAMEEE one as YOUUUUU.   I LOOOOOVVVVEEEE YYYYYOOOOOUUU
Moriah is the best
Pls do more art things to do when your board
Video idea:  Making custom Snowglobes or night lights!
It's the neverending gesso, ahahahahahahahah
She gives me penelope Garcia vibes
have you ever tired to use a sponge to blend ur gradients ?
Omg ITS SO CUTE!!!
omg i love your sweater
I found a way you can not see the red inside the bubble gum machine you can paint over the little clear flap btw I have the same gum ball machine
lol love it :)
If you want a faster blending technique: grab a sponge, put the two colors you want to blend on there and dab the sponge on the object. I hope this helped ☺️
Plz paint on rubber ducks
Idk when merchandise is leaving because I accidentally unsubscribed but I don’t know when merchandise is going away because I might get some I’m not 100% sure but I really wanna know
You suck stop talking and just pant
To many rainbow 🌈
COME ON SUB TO THIS GIRL
Hey I am the 16k comenter
Anybody else notice on one of the price stickers when she ripped it it said ood will
Omg. Congratulations 🎊 moriah almost going to hit 6 million.
Luv the sweater
Please paint a rubber duck family
This was soooo cool!
I love this design💓 great job!
Benson.
She should've put the "pretty cool, huh?" audio after she finished the machine!
She can put all her mini squishes in it, ans make it a squishy machine! XD
There is no limit to the usefulness of cupcake Moriah.
Your my fav you tuber
omg u so close to 6 million :O love u moriah!
Who else saw the yt story of her giving a (ahem) hint of what she will paint this week
It felt like forever waiting for your video You are the best  Love you Aunt Moriah Elizabeth
Do painting on rubix cube on which you do 1 character each side.... please do it....
you get more for free apparently the bubble gum machine dosest like  money
I love it.
Im disappointed you should of done the pins
OMG I just noticed you're left handed after watching you for yearsss lololol
you could put a piece of colorful sheet foam in the dispenser part if the red bothers you that much... no chipping and it can be any color you want to match the rest of it!!
I have a mini small gumball machine
I wold by this
You could literally change the background color every transition and I would never notice

It’s nice to see the under rated characters get their spot.
Why does my mom have the same bubble gum machine
Ok number one I can’t believe that she quoted spongbob and two my cat is named Lucy !
Name the machine Burgos
llol im terning 11 on march 31
When you're watching Moriah u always gotta trust the process 😭👌 That looks so beautifulllll
I love her  Merchandise I got pickles plushie
YOU COULD FILL IT WITH THE RUBBER DUCKS
I wonder if it would've been more helpful to wet the paper, so that it would stick to the glass.
Me :sees cardbored  My mum:welp she is gunna paint it     Me:TIME TO PAINT *grabs out pain and paints*    My mum:dawngggg     Me :SLYTHERIN FOR LIFE ALSO RAVEN CLAW AND ALL THE OTHERA BRO     mother:knew it   Brother:wow this is so normal now that she is into harry potter and is inlove with draco
That's So Beautiful!😱
Love it !!
Got a pink one my brother broke it...got another
love ITTTTT!!!!
Can you say to everybody in the new video where I said so I'm I love your videos and you should do a video how you make unicorns and no pictures of death except one step 2 Step 3 step 4 step 5 and I didn't mean and also you're my biggest fan
I  saw  your  Tik tok
At 9:17 Everyone: Looking at Moriah painting.  Me: Looking at Fred at the top right corner on her SkEtCh BoOk SkEtCh bOoK.
Hey guys, am I the only one who has seen that color order somewhere before? I just can't remember where I saw them 🤔
she has 5.97m
DISCLAIMER: I have just started the video.   My first thought would be for you to crumple up papers with ideas and squishies written down, and then whatever comes out when you twist would be what you do for a squishy makeover and or craft challenge.   Idk I just think it would be fun and interesting. A nice way to randomize.
I love your sweater
I am so shook I literally thought in my brain that the cat should be named Lucy right before you said it. I’m like so surprised right now 😂🤭
Did any one else not notice her reflection in the gum ball Machine
Ikr
Doesn’t the sloth already have a name?
Ok I don’t know why but I would really like to see her make a Rubix cube with some of her characters that are different colors on the sides. Does anyone agree?
My favourite character on the glass was the sloth 😂 idk why its just so adorable and nice to see 🤣🙂 uhm well...bye
Lucy is the name of my dead cat
I hate it when people say "Moriah how did you know it could be a bugger" like have you never blew your nose before
At this point I feel like Moriah is basically the next Lisa Frank
OH MY GOSH MORIAH THE BUBBLE GUM MACHINE IS SOOOOOO CUTE 🥰 I LOVE IT KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK❤️❤️❤️
Another addition to your dreamy work station 🌈💕
30000 peeps left
she so arty  i love her creation
"So they can really pop" Me: Pun
instead of dispensing gum imagine if one dispensed mini squisheys
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You are sooooo amazing  You are my inspiration  You are soooo talented ☺️☺️😊😊😊😊
Yussssss
I bet everytime she makes another video we can see her just chwing bubble gum as she paints
Moriah gotta plug in her cupcake look every upload lol
My cousin says hi Moriah
I wish I could do this
Me: 7 hours late
my grandma used to have a gumball machine in the bedroom it was that exact model and she put gumballs in it for me and my brother
😋😀🤩🦄
i just got my march
This comment is inspired by Katie’s comment Yes I want RUBBER DUCKS   wat abt Georgie as a rubber duck??? Edit: -realizes Georgie is a pineapple-
Today is my birthday and I turned 13
The sloth sort of looks like Winnie the Pooh with honey. :)
I am not surprised it is rainbow
This was my fave video you made  good job  I love it  and my BFF Mikalay loves your YouTube videos so please if you can say hi to a Mikalay  it would make me and her so happy  thank you so super much
Really hope you have the fart guy in your merch soon
You should have done a ice cream  theme
Who wants bake with me new video hit like if u want so Moriah can see it
It is sooo prettyyy🌈🌈💜💜
Hey Moriah you should paint your table and you can put pickle and other squishes that you painted so your table will be art of your whole art room btw I am your biggest fan!!!
AHHHH 5.97M SUBS AHHHHHHH
You should paint on a rubix cube 🤩
only thing id do is make the metal parts silver or gold if that wouldn't ruin it
This really showcases how good you are at the painting they look so clean & cartoony
Csn you paint on a ring
If I were you, I would've dumped that whole thing in a tub of bleach. 😷
My dad has one of those, i should borrow it and paint it he won't mind Also you could have used pom poms instead of bubble gum as its more of a display item and just gotten one bag of gum for astestics
Its Sooo Cool!!
it was wonderfull
THRIFT STORE MAKEOVERS ARE THE BEST!  Squishy makeovers are awesome, but the thrift store stuff is definitely number one! LOVE IT
*THERE IS A SELLER IN AMAZON SELLING MORIAH’S MERCH WITHOUT GIVING HER CREDIT THIS ISN’T FAIR MORIAH WORKS SO HARD ON ALL HER MERCH AND SQUISHES COPY PASTE THIS COMMENT AND GET MORIAH TO SEE ANY COMMENT LIKE THIS THANK YOU FOR HELPING { ALL CREDITS TO CHARLIE DOG THE ORIGINAL COMMENTER*
<3 you are the highlight of my friday
Ello this was posted 7 hours ago wao :) also i love your channel keep up the good work ☺️
You could put mini panda buns in the machine
Mariah: you now what Me: what  Mariah: OOWWWW
The design is sooooooo cute. But one thing that distracts is that the dull silver colour against the pastel rainbow. You should fix that . Love you so much MORIAH
me thinking... will her channel last till the gesso paint jar is completely out of gesso??
12:31 anyone else notice the 'new frames need analysing' message through the middle of the screen? I don't think it should be there.....
THIS IS AWESOME!!! I want one.💯 I NEED ONE. LOL Please sell these, My daughter will freak out.
If you  do shout outs can you shout me out

Ok I saw the thumbnail and got sooooo exited because I went to an antique shop and I got the EXACT same gumball machine and at least a year later which now was 2 months ago I spray painted it white white sparkles not as much creativity as moriah but I thought that that was a really cool coincidence! Anyways I love u moriah and ur vids I think ur amazing and I love hearing that "hey its me" every Friday 💖
❤❤❤ME is awesome and she deserves  10M subscribers!!!! ❤️She does so many things for her viewers (us) She so kind, she doesn't do this for us, she does it because she likes it!❤️ If ME is reading this it is SO SO SO true!!! ❤️I love your videos!❤️❤️❤️I love you Moriah!
Looks awesome!☆
you should change the intro music
Why am I getting so much deja vu from this video??? Is this a re-upload or a glitch in the matrix??
Me: MY NAME IS LUCY
Play minecraft moriah
Yay another video 😁
Lovedddddd this !!!! 😍😍😍
moriah always calls herself a bad artist but she’s literally the best artist on youtube in my opinion. she’s really creative
So cute!! I love all of your videos!
you should do a little character popping a bubblegum in the transparent lid of the gum dispenser so it kinda distracts from the red background, i love you!💗
Moriah: It did cost 65 but I did get some dead skin cells Me: 👁👄👁 whatdidshesayyyy
Yours should make an among us squishy
People walking into moriahs house - wow you have a custom gumball machine and a custom everything wow
Just found your channel. You rock! Do you sell your items?
Pin me or I'll steal all your squishies
I KNEW she was gonna be painting a gumball machine!! After the clue she gave us! YAY!! Loved the video!😄♥️

MORIAH; THE BACKROUND CHANGE IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL ME;I ITS KINDA COOL  ALSO ME; BUT WHY MORIAH THINK IT IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL
This was soo colourful and amazing. ❤️Your soo talented moriah. Also you'll have enough bubble gum for years now 😘😊

“Gooy price stickers should be illegal”             *mood*
Window markers or chalk markers probably would’ve worked a bit better, but it still turned out nice!
Moriah... SAY SORRY TO THE POOR TO THE POOR OLD PRICE STICKER!😤 You👈 Thought us to love✨❤️ AND NOW UR BULLYING THAT STICKER!😭 NO STICKER DISCRIMINATION !😭 (Also pls notice meeeee! I know now u have millions of subs and I only subbed when u posted ur first ✨squishy makeover ✨ Ep.... ( 552 K subs, around that) But I did watch ur old make up vids!)

I have the gum ball thing
I love love love love love love love you're video sooooooooooooo much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh the background color changed   I honestly don’t notice until she pointed it out
you could paint the outside of the glass protecting where it dispenses to make everything match
Imagine getting a heart from moriah
Moriah:Nobody likes you! Gooy price sticker: 😵😵😵😵😵
She should of made where the bubble gum was at make a hole there and then the bubble gum could show the actual bubble gum in the glass.
Who else thought they loved rainbow then met Moriah?
I love your videos
For anyone who wants to see her paint on rubber ducks | | V
I think it gives more cus there small but to late know you got 8 bags of bubble gum sooo
I live how Moriah uses herself as a meme🤣

You said to remind you about the Easter themed squishies, this is your reminder. 🐣
I don’t want to be rude but I think you should change up your style a bit you commonly do rainbow colors/pastel, maybe you could mix it up?
Me and my 7 yr old sister were watching this, and when she said Burt my sister term goes I named my dog burt
Ya toldly no perdikcler oder btw WE A LL KNOW ITS 🌈
moriah better be subbed to @Georgie
Are you going to bring back that dragon fruit dalmatian character in the future? I would love to see her (or him) again
Moriah: looks like every other bubble gum machine you have seen! EVER! Me: I have not seen a bubble gum machine (Even in a video)
My mom has the same gum ball machine
Moriah: making screeching noises👄 YT captions: *Music*  IM DYING AJAJAKAKA
I loved The drawings
PLEASE REPLY OR LIKE TO SEE HER PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS/GIVE HER THE ATTENTION 👏🏻👏🏻

I love you, you are amazing!!!!
If you didn’t tell us the background changed, I legit wouldn’t even notice
I have been watching her for years nd I just  realized that she is left handed like if you did to
Please get a squishy from the hopeless bin
To fix the whole red thingy just paint the clear part you lift up
You're the best moriah!!EEEEe!!!
Okay, let's get real here....Is it just me or did Moriah's face that she painted as a cupcake replace the squishy ghost? Btw, I'm not trying to throw any hate here or anything, I just thought it was a funny observation bc I love Moriah so much and I watch all her vids! Love you Moriah!
Your uh... Nails remind me of the ice truck killers prosthetic hand nails from Dexter.
She should've made a cupcake instead!
Hey Moriah can u do a create this book 2 ep 11. Plsssss I put of inspiration
next week u should do instead on painting on paint with a paintbrush dip the squishy in the paint
I am actually so in love with this bubble gum dispenser! May be one of my fav things you've ever made!
Her: oops background change Me: wait really oh yea
Hey Moriah! Can you please make BumbleBear the pin as a squishie? I think it would be cute! :>
3:53 but then I noticed: Shopee Ad: are you afraid of touching unknown surfaces? YouTube really comfy with these ads 😩😩😂
13:45 I'm getting kawaii halloween vibes from this for some reason-
This is one of my favourite thrift shop video
I loved your creation.
Nice sweater
Dude is nobody gonna talk about the adorable sweater she’s wearing?
Awesome 👏 I love it 🥰
Why is she so pretty- like flawless much..
If you really hate seeing the red inside, you could always paint over the clear cover of it, where gum doesn’t touch it anyway.
more squishy bakeover pls they helped me bake
Can we just talk about how beautiful she is:
Do baking again
The second I saw 5hat cat I literally said LUCY and then we she said I was like whaaaaaaaaaa!

I knew it it was a gumball machine
13:24 it looks so pretty 🦋❤️
Hiiiiiiii moriah
Moriahs intro sound like that tik tok where the guy asks his dog to give me a “owa owa”
I think she should paint the rubber ducks. It looks fun too 🦆🐤
This might be one of my most favorites
Seven hours :0
She is so close to hitting 6 million omg congratulations🎉🎊
Moriah you should get your design published so no one can copy it pls and is the stuff you use for your videos in MICHAEL'S craft store

Attendance for Learning how to open Acrylic Gesso  Thx For 0 likes! (Maybe 1 like) And also can you make a Bake With Me vid next time and I think the name for the sloth should be Jerald
Hi Miria sorry if I spelt that rong but you should paint the clear thing were the gum balls come out and you won’t see the red.
Moriah: how about BERT Me: hehe that's my neighbors cats name
You should have done grumpy 🍒

hi moriah! I just wanted to ask if can make your macake in squishy from.
I have this exact gumball machine-  wtf how old is my dad
Hey Moriah Did You Make Your Intro 7 Seconds On Purpose So No One Would Skip It By Double Taping Their Screen?
I was painting my limbs with Lotion-
where did you get that sweater? :o
Oh you could have added dots on the main big part and sprinkles on the top hat thingy for it to be less plain
Why does she only have 5mil subs 😡 she needs more RIGHT NOW!
Love theese vids UwU make me calm
And also, AM I JUST AN IDIOT WHO NEVER REALIZED THAT MORIAH WAS LEFT HANDED????
Moriah saying it's a mini bubble when it's a bit big  Me thinks of eleven: Friends don't lie
If you think she should make a mr hot coco bear comment on my other comment yes
Its my birthday!!
I just bought your blanket! 😍
1:14 ITS FREEEEEEE
I love your sweater you always look so pretty in your videos thanks for making my day  better :)
Moriah makes my very bad day turn into an awesome day.🤩🥰😍 She is sooooo funny😂😁
hiii i just bougt the merch :D
“In No pAtIcUlAR oRdeR”  Me: phfffffff that’s a lie “ShhhHhHHhHh”
I love this i want one lol i love you
She just needs 30k subs for 5mil subs! Come on guys we can do this!!!!
Haii!!!
you could paint the outside of the little clear flap to cover the red without risking eating paint haha ! super cute
I have never bought any merch from any youtuber, but if you made nelson merch, I would bite the bullet and buy it lol
This video was sooooo gooodd!!! I wanted to eat all of those gumballs🥺
Me after watching days upon days of tik tok: *Listens to intro* "HOOOH! ITS A SPEAD UP VERSION OF "Owa owa!" OMG..."
Absolutely adorable 🥰
I swear Moriah need to play animal crossing.
I lve you so soo much Moriah
OMG I LOOOOOOOVE THE FINISHED LOOK
I had the exact same one, says 25c but it pops a gum regardless so we used it at parties to fund some of the acohol.. just ask your guests to use it and they 100% will cuz it's fun (dollar store sold bags of gumballs for 1$ so we bought a few to fill the machine) and would use the funds for the laundromat lol... ...i moved and eventually broke the glass....
Bruh the sound effects made me laugh 😂
So beautiful transformation !
Every main character has his thang cousin dork eats, Georgie says ello what's pickles thang
Omg the machine is so cute
Moriah: I'm 26.  Me: Wait a second. When did you turn 26? Uhhhhhhh.....
Love it love you
Omg.. the result is amazing!!! Love it!
Girl when you posted that YouTube story I thought you where gonna paint on gumballs😂💀
Um...quick question do you ever get your money back???
Can we all appreciate that Moriah uses her own memes UwU
* gumball machine
" *GewWwy pricestickers should be illegal , No oNe LiKeS yOu* " Everyone agrees , right ? 😂😂
This is very beautiful... everyone must try this.
00:36 wow that happend to me before so hahah we can relate
3: 24 I really got scared when your face came to the gesso
Random thought, scared chicken night mask needs to be a thing.
*Please make Among Us shrink plastic pins! <3*  *(Please like so she can see this request.)*
2:13 ooh I have very rare things at my home😶
Anyone else know it was a gumball machine because of her hint?
Moriah just wanted say that I have that sweater you were wearing in your video. When I saw it I paused the video just to go put on the sweater so we could match. Love you!!!!!!
I want to see painting on ducks painting on squishes! And painting on....CoNtAiNeRs!.!.!.
There is a seller on Amazon selling Moriah's design, and merch, without giving her credit. This isn't fair, Moriah works so hard on all of her squishy's and merch. Copy and paste let's try and get Moriah to see this comment. Please help! Thank you. "(All credit goes to Charlie Dog, the original commenter.)
I love it
I love your sweater so much
OMG YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR POM POMS OR MOCHIES IN THERE
Please do another create this book 2 video
Is there any "National Art Day" ?? If no why ?!!
Me:Yes I love it-OH COME ON A ADD
My mom dose not have muney to biy me of mrch can I please have them for free please I am banging you please 😔😔😔😔
With the feet squishys you got ages ago you should make  a  skeleton
Omg i love the name Nelson for the green pin
This is how many people love Moriah.. 👇
i wish you didn't show the cleaning part i feel sick LOL
this is random but I thought about it while watching: maybe you should fill the machine with tiny squishies like the little mango that you did in one of your first make overs. then you should make an episode or a new series of painting them. So you don’t get to pick them or anything. then after you finish all of them, put them back in and boom! Decorated squishy bubblegum machine :D
I love pickle and Georgie! This is how many people agree!    I    I   V
Please do something with among us characters😃😃😃
How do Moriah’s videos get better and better every week!?
Do squishy makeover pls
You were right that it was VERY colorful, and yet, somehow, it wasn't too much! It still absolutely pleased my eyes to see the finished product!!! 💖
Me Refreshing the page every minute to see her hit 6 MILLION !!!! YOU'RE SO CLOSE MORIAH  CONGRATULATIONS
I was waiting for her video till 11.06 pm and you posted at 3.30 am Im in India and of couse there are time difference
I didn’t notice the reflection till you mentioned it
Is it just me who got an uber eats ad..AGAIN.
Moriah: paint the meat  Me: wait wa-
Hi
Why editing app dose she use
Who wants to see her *PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS* ????
I thought you were going to paint them all inside the glass like it was a claw machine
me trying to not look at her pencil
Moriah: how old am i? oh im 26 me: "clears trought" ur 26 but acting like a 7 yr old "no offence moriah"
love the result!!!
*who wants to see her paint paint brushes.... only me?... ok..*
You can use this to decide which squishes will get painted 👀
You could paint the cap of the dispenser instead of the red inside and then you won’t be able to see it until you grab the gum from the dispenser
How old am I  I'm 26 what's ur point Me that's why we love u ❤🤍🖤
Omg I called it
omg i love it it is soooo cool really really wanna eat all of the bubble gums . btw when she says all just left to do i am like is she singing the LOVE STORY song ???? . the song has a line that says ALL JUST LEFT TO DO IS RUN. idk why that comes to a head
Moriah!  Graveyard Loon made Pickle out of felt and posted a video today!
Nielsen the pickle of thrift store makeovers
Aw I love it! I like the thrift store makeovers even more than squishy makeovers
Not me watching tommyinnit and then this right after lol
WHY DOESN’T SHE HAVE MORE SUBSCRIBERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi
Hello so I know you like happy stuff my my grandfather died not so long ago and when I cry I go straight to you I fell like your goofy fun video are an escape from my tears because I cant help myself from laughing. I hope you go far in life and I know millions or people say I love you but I want you go know your a star and queen your my idol.
"Gooey price stickers should be illegal" *i felt the struggle*
Pumpky the pumpkin plush
Me at the beginning: you can put pompoms instead of bubblegums!! Not knowing what is going to happen in the end..fingers crossed
I was happy that for the first time  Moriah posted a story on the community
Can you pleaseee please please please make a mr hot coco plush? It’s my dream to have one
I loved this video! Also I agree Moriah, even the squishiest that aren’t on camera a lot still need love.
* me who thought she was going to paint a piece of gum * 👁👄👁
Acrylic paint is the best for glass 👍
Why does this video seem familiar
I love it!!
E
Awww it ended up so pretty!
Hey for future q and a.... My friend and I want to send you a couple squishes. What's your PO box number?
Sooooooooooooooo clove to 6mm
Birtrum
Who else wants a new room tour like and spam if you agree
If the inside bothers you, maybe fold some pastel coloured paper into a cup and stick it into the machine, and replace it whenever it gets too worn
To whoever reading this it's okay to have emotions. It's okay to cry. Be yourself because everybody else is taken. Everything will be okay in the end if it's not okay it's not the end. You may not be the best of be the best you can be. Not everything pretty sparkles and shines. If you're feeling sad hopefully this made your day a little bit better.God bless you and your family.🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
NAME THE SLOTH SAILOR OR SAGE PLS
Kinda want a Nelson plushy
Yeah no rainbows here
Hey Moriah, Can you please do a ART ROOM TOUR (Again), Because I really enjoy the tour and I want to see what's happening with you and your art room tour. PLEASE DO IT.  ART ROOM TOUR 2021
Me sees this:     Now i want her to do a claw machine
I feel like Can you put the same type of color paints and rainbow designs on the stuff that you paint on
Before it was painted it looked like a jelly belly jellybean dispenser  but , the jellybelly one doesn't use a coun to get any candy that can fit .
Girl your random very random
We are drawing gumball machins in art
Please paint rubber ducks😭
Did anybody else use their psychic powers like me and predict that his name was going to be Nelson?!?
12:30 wat? I dont want that blue line DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
Not me yelling “gumball” louder and louder each time she said “bubblegum”.
THIS IS WHY FRIDAYS ARE THE BEST DAYS
Moriah, here's a bit of advise if you do glass painting again. I actually have a part time job as a window painter for holidays and such, and I have found that basic acrylics work best for me.
Ooo im late but I like the thrift store makeovers
Moriah: no more sound effects How we say it in school/ me: no more onomonapias
The best thrift makeover:)
I was In panic mode and quickly trying to solve a problem- Video gets cut in by an ad about vaping 😳
If you go to 0.45 in the vid it looks like a squishy is sitting on the gumball machine.
Plz name the cat lucy cause i had a cute little dog named lucy. And then she died
PLEASE start using enamel paint for glass. I promise it will change your life
HeLlO mOriAh! That's me when I'm sooo exited

Lmfao everyone called the gumball machine
My favourite makeover to date. It looks incredible
I knew the second she was gonna make it rainbow 🌈
3:36 who else legit SHIVERED when she rubbed her nail on the paint? That hurttttt
13:13 that match
I wanna be just like you when I’m older but I know you don’t do shoutouts but if you did could I have one?!
Am I the only one who thought her YouTube story hint was a bubble? I didn’t even think of gum for some reason lol
Not to be dramatic but... I would DIE for Nelson!!
Does anyone else hit their knee or elbow and say ow but it actually didn’t hurt
Pls do a squish makeover
A knew you were gonna do rainbow there
new frames need analyzing; click analyze 😏
Do you still take dance lessons?
you do a LOT of rainbow stuff, I mean, I am not hating, im just like, its kinda repetitive and i keep seeing the same thing over again, HOT HATING just mentioning.
It is so cute
A rainbow, you say? Hmm. Sounds kind of wild.
“Well this machine is wack!” *smiles because it has personality* 🥴
I Love your video and I'm your biggest fan ❤
Who your good at drawing
pls paint rubber ducks
First video with my pickle plush. So excited!!
Okay, is it just me or is it the fact that she called it a bubblegum machine instead of a gumball machine!! I'm strugglinggggg
you are my favourite youtuber i m from  india pls wish me happy birthday cause my birthday is on 30 th january 😜😜😜😜🎉🎉🎂🎂
Hey Marhi can we be friends
I think she said wittle
3:21 Top 10 SCARIEST Jump Scares
i loveee it its soo cute
Moriah the queen
I like how you used more of the lesser known characters from your channel
PLACE YOUR BETS WHEN WILL THE GESSO RUN OUT
so i was thinking about how moriah didn’t like the red inside the bubble gum machine and she didn’t want to paint it because that’s where the bubblegum drops and she didn’t want anything chipping, but what if she taped paper inside of it, i think it would look pretty good :)
Couldn’t you have painted the little clear cover if you wanted to hide the red inside?
I love it!
Every Friday I wait to hear ‘hey it’s me’ and it just makes my day
Claim your before 1M views here!!
I think she could and should put jellybeans in it
I’m gonna make a petition for Rosie merch!! 😍❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

Your videos are amazing I am a verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry big fan
Meeeeeeeeeee

I Wait  Patiently Every Friday When moriah post
Awesome video! :D
Totally not watching at 3am
Omgosh this is so cute! You shouldn’t worry about changing background colors. I don’t even notice and this is about color, so actually you should change the background color more often. ♥️
i had never bought or used gesso before (i’m in 9th grade idk how i had never used it) but in my art class i was priming a bookshelf and i HATE gesso it’s either my art teachers gesso sucks or idk but it was a terrible experience it was so thin i did at least 25 coats lol sorry
Wow
i wfirst time woke up for your video(till 1:56) and then i slept 2 3 minutes after u posted
This channel is quirky
Go buy the slippers thar soooo nice
I saw a student at my school wearing the blue pickle hoodie
*when we’re already to makeover 9-*
Hi Maria I’m your biggest fan I’ve been watching you since the beginning and at the beginning I know about your other channel that just saying have a good life and a good year your biggest fan
Lol idk why but i get so exited when she posts
I was going to ask you to do that one every week I’m so excited to listen to hae it me
OMG I LOVE YOU SWEATER
NOBODY:    Moriah it the gesso that never EnDs!!!!!!
I can see my self in the glass that's distracting I wouldn't have not seen it if she didn't point it out
You guys should buy mora Elisabeths slippers thar soooooooo  Comfortableand sooo cute
I love it!
She is the only reason i kept sane in 2020
This was amazing!!
The main ingredient in being a amazing artist you know how people say to be yourself well don't do that
Hai moriah I love your videos!! When I'm older I hope to be like you!!!! <3
I JUST WOKE UP! and I just saw your video!............and just......CLICKED IT!
I’ve literally been looking for posca pens all day today!!!
Who else wants to see her paint those nesting dolls?
The elbow thing kept me entertained for a good ten minutes.  And Gumhole not Bumhole- this is genius content.  5 stars!
Hello Moriah! You’re vids are so great! I hope to get famous like you one day..
# mora Elisabeths slippers are soooo comfortable and cute
idk if you take art ideas but you should do glass paintings
Me:mom I broke my phone  My mom :how  Me: because I smashed that subscrib and like button for moriahs videos My mom: who's moriah  Me:mom its moriah  Haha Just imagine moriah made a group or like a army it would be the GEORGIE squad or pickle  army  XD and also can you post videos every Tuesday and Friday because I cant wait until Friday  you inspire me ♡♡☆☆
I was happy to see some one else has one.
This just screams moriah to much!✨💕
Who else loves her? 🥺
Now just paint the gum
Your slippers are soooo comfortable and soooooooo cute I love them
me;vibing to the intro
I just wanted to say you are the most amazing person I have ever seen I love watching your videos and seeing what creative thing you come up with on friday I love your creativity and how funny you are I wish I could buy something from your store but money is kinda tight so I'm trying to save up to buy a houdy to support you I love seeing your content every friday and watching ☺️😊
My first thought when i saw the machine Fans: Rainbow 🌈
I wanna try and get stuff from goodwill but I’m just afraid of the grime that’s gonna be on it😬
:>
Nice video moriah ,!
I wanted gum so much while watching this !!!!!!🍬👱‍♀️😞
Moriah: I am gonna wipe this down AGAIN.. Because.. look at all this dust!  Me: Anyway I just got this spoon from goodwill and I don't have to clean I because its super clean ;)
You are a artist like me I'm in a competition doing art cause I'm a professional just like you
Are you a lefty
So cool
YouTube Nofitications: 5 hours ago Comments: *SIX HOURS AGO*
MAKE THIS MERCH! 🙃😄
*i love how she uses her own memes*  There epic❤
Can you do a painting on rubber ducks series? Like if you agree.
love your designs
One of my favorite projects you’ve done so far! Love it! ❤️🌈❤️
You should use acetone to remove the top layer! Acetone dissolves plastic and it may be super useful! It smells bad though...
Moria talking to us like we are her friends but actually we are all just strangers or fans
I really want to see the *Pupkin* turn into a real life plushie. That would've been so cute🥺🥺
How come I just realized I'm chewing gum while you're painting a gumball machine
Such an awesome video! Keep up the amazing work!
I had a dream...Moriah made a custom Rubix cube  PLEASE MAKE ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
If I get catcalled I am gonna say “u got a dirty gum hole” 🤣
I think the bubble gum balls are smaller than regular size ones so that’s why more than one came out at a time :)
Dude, pride month must be a paradise for you, *rainbows everywhere*
It so cUtE
I hope she actually eats the gum inside
you could try nail art. its like, the only art you've never done
i'm sick this made me feel better
Every single thing in the video because the comment section can't decide: -Moriah 2021
You could glue some colored felt on the inside to cover the red and not risk chipping.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Moriah: colors in NO particular order! Me (rainbow)
Moriah I choose you use them song  The rainbow hatter fainted
Omg I really loved this makeover so much probably my favorite makeover so far 🤩 and ps hearing you say how old you are makes me feel so much older and a little out of place for watching you lol oh well I really enjoy watching your videos even though I am a bit older than you 💗
I’ll take all of your leftover bubblegum just for no reason, totally don’t have children in my basement I sort of need to feed
I actually really love the characters on the glass once the gum balls were added. I really love the dragon I forget her name but yes her.
It is so cute. Amazing job Moriah.
The 500 ppl who disliked likes the old red bubblegum machine more
Plot twist while putting the thing together she breaks the glass and curses for the first time   Then uses the freight you chicken to beep it out   Starts laughing and gets 5.97 million haters🥲
my name is lucy😄
My mind put tiny squishes in little capsules
Moriah: omg im gonna get the 100th rainbow sweater!  Me: onistly idc at this point do wht ever u want Lol im probably gonna get no likes ;(
*Who all loves Moriah's own memes*
Such an amazing  idea , you did  so great, looks really  cool
Who else knew she was going to do this from her story lol 😂
Am I early?
I agree, paint on rubber sucks next pleaseeeeeee
idky but moriahs voice makes me sleepy
I'm stupid thought it was gonna be a bathtub
When the chicken/duck family son came in my whole life got better
MORIAH YOU SHOULD CUSTOMIZE A RUBIX CUBE
This one is probably my favorite vedio now😄
So funny 🤣
IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OTHER BUBBLE GUM MACHINE I'VE SEEN THE BOWL IS EGG SHAPE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
what happened at 12:31 😳
She also has her own pencil with lots of characters of hers
Ehem! Get your painting on rubber ducks tickets here!
I LOVE this!  So cute!
Moriah is amazing she should deserve zero hate even if you don't like her personality you are still going to love her videos she is just the best you tuber everrrrrr sub now or else and like pleaaaaase she deserves it!!!! BTW love you moroah♥
Love your sweater :)
Imagine watching without time laps and editing.
😍
Moriah's nail matches
Moriah : I was in a panic mode *Mobile Legend ad appears* the girl in the ad : stay calm, stay calm, we got this! how perfect can anything get
I think you were getting two a time because the type of bubblegum you bought was smaller then the normal type of bubble gum put in these types of machines
The face in the gesso scared me lol
She has amazing ideas and it turns out amazing no matter what she does!
moriah : posts a video  me : ahhh i have a gift time to watch it before doing anything else. ps i love your art and crafts and get inspired to do what you do sooo love you moriah ( and your memes make me laugh every single time in videos )
I hope she enjoys her bubble gum
The description has a typo lol
Moriah: Sticky sticker tags should be illegal SSSniperwolf:That’s Illegal
RUBBER DUCKIES! RUBBER DUCKIES RUBBER DUCKIES (PLASEEEE)
I wish you will answer or reply to me
A week later Moriah is gonna be like, hey guys look at the Bubble gum machines available for pre-order now on my shop hehe
I LOVE ur shirt!
So no one is gonna point out that she had that “new frames analyze thing-                    no one?            just me-           𝗼𝗸.
Me when she drawing charters she better draw gorgie then I hear here I will not be using gorgie me I wanna go crazy!
Why couldn't she paint the second coat and not draw color or whatever?
Correction: 4 1/2 things of gum. XD I noticed it just because I was studying for a math quiz! LOL I would have never noticed it XD
She makes my week every Friday I love to watch her she is so amazing
You should do a other squishy makeover
Knew it hehe
Moriah should do a rubix cube painting cube painting video where she paints one of her characters on each side, COPY AND PASTE SO SHE SEES       original poster: Izzy Roberts
WHY NOT GORGI
Is it just Me or do y’all like that she uses her own sound effects and memes (I think)
Love it
The thick hacksaw strikingly heat because continent likely pop around a loud pleasure. cumbersome, picayune slime
i thought you are painting on bubble gum
Pin meh
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭i love your videos so much I wish I could meet you and you oh funny cool anyone that meets you deserves to meet you
Hey Moriah could you please paint rocks!!!! Please
@moriah elizabeth can you do something that you make into an astronaut???
We're is Sam🖤🖤🖤??? ,
I want to see rubber ducks
Me: scrolling through my youtube reccomend page  Also me: sees a new video by her and is the happiest i have ever been
Oh my gosh, I love the bubblegum machine!
You just made my Friday 100x better, I just wanted to say thanks.
One of your best thrift store makeovers 🧡🧡🧡
Also love when you paint rainbows  Like if you agree 👇👇
Me: refreshing the page and waiting for her to hit 6 million
love it...Love It...LOVE IT 🥰
That is my name my name is Lucy
Moriah always says she won't make a rainbow...and then she makes a rainbow.
I have that exact bubble gum machine hahah.
Am I the only person who thinks when she says its me, they can't decide whether she means her initials or like the word me. *The confusion is pain*
I can't wait to see some bubble gum crafts. Bubble gum Garland? Bubble gum paint by number? The possibilities are endless.
Moriah: wHy do I sTiLl hAvE sO mUcH gEsSo?         Me, (a stranger things nerd) : *the answer to a never-ending gessoooooooooo aaaaaaaaaaaaa gessooooooooooooo*
This was such a cute upgrade!! I love the characters all over the glass and I love that you used different/less used guys and gals.
You could cover the inside red part with washi tape. Amazing transformation as always! ❤
Did anyone notice close to the end where she shows the bubble gum there is a message that says “new frames need analyzing. Click to analyze” no just me... ok
you should un-customize something
In other words, me wants to trace.  Haha
Moriah: Hey it’s me! Me: HeYyY iTs YoUuUuUuUuUuUuUuUu
7:14 lol that’s my cats name and Nelson is my last name
We have that same bubble gum machine.
Love it 😊
MAKE A FROGGGG PLEASEEE IM BEGGING YOU!!! IVE NEVER SEEN U DO A FROG AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SO CUTE A FROG WITH A STAWBERRY HAT PLEASE OR A LETTUCE HAT!
My name is lucy
I wouldn't noticed the background change if she did not mention it. And if, I would assume it is a creative choice.
Nobody:...    Moriah: Gooey price stickers should be illegal  *NoBOdY LiKeS YoU*
This extremely cute, I love it! I think I'd paint that black part too, maybe would make it white... but anyways, good job as always Moriah!
It looks very good
now I want bubble gum
Moriah: Here is my lovely bubble gum machine        Me: Is it a special or what? Like a pet? Woah that’s weird
Amazing superb video 😄 you are so sweet , beautiful , funny and creative 🤩 Can I get a heart? <3      .                 - Moody
Who wants that moriah to paint on those rubber ducks
Cool
Just when you did something cool and pretty
Hi girl love your videos
When you gave the hint I thought you were painting gum.
You should fill it up with tiny circular squishy
Can I buy it
This turned out to be so adorable! If that red inside part is still bugging you, maybe you can try to put some vinyl contact paper in there!
It is my birthday!!!
Anyone else have some weird unexplained obsession with gumball machines/toy dispensers/vending machines? I just love them so freaking much.
Can you paint on a Gesso can please?
If you go back to the video we created the lemon and strawberry cake roll you could see your whole entire collection was so small
You should do a video we’re you add paint to jeso and then do a video called painting with jeso
it is my birthday today
Moriah should do a “Painting A Rubix Cube” video, where she paints one of her characters on each side, COPY AND PASTE THIS SO SHE SEES
It should be Izzy the ice cream kat
That looks amazing! You did such a great job!
'ItzSunee' told me to write this: Moriah should do a “Painting A Rubix Cube” video, where she paints one of her characters on each side, COPY AND PASTE THIS SO SHE SEE'S  I also added an apostrophe to the "SEES".  Your welcome.  Edit: "When NOT to Use an Apostrophe The following are some of the most frequent errors: Do not use an apostrophe in the possessive pronouns whose, ours, yours, his, hers, its, or theirs. ... Do not use an apostrophe in verbs. Apostrophes sometimes show up in verbs that end in -s, such as marks, *sees* , or finds." This is what happens when I try to be big brain. I mess up.
theres no red in your rainbow
I think I know the issue with the multiple bubble gums coming out they might be smaller than what I originally was supposed to be used with it therefore it would be releasing as many as it thinks is one that must vary between 2 3 and even possibly 4
Wow you draw so cool and unic
Every Friday is my happy day cause I see a new video form moriah, also Moriah I love your creativity
Uhm i don't remember if I did this already so sorry if I asked this twice attempt 3- or 4? of asking you to paint on CD discs c:

I’m a 5th grade teacher in Texas. Because of the pandemic, all my students are virtual and it’s challenging making things feel ‘normal’ for them and creating connections. Thanks to your art, I’ve been able to bond with several of my students by noticing Pickle and Georgie merch they’ve worn on our Zoom classes. Thank you for creating content that speaks to 10 year olds and 26 year olds alike. Your videos and characters aren’t just fun, they bring people together!
My phone is at 3%
Moriah: stressing about background changes Me with ADHD: colourful gg changes keeping me hooked into watching and actually being helpful
Hey moriah
Moriah: *brings in the youngest addition of the chicken family* Me: *sharp intake of breath because I thought she was gonna do the whole family*

What I look forward to every Friday and to chill on the weekend and go through all of her videos that I probably missed but I probably didn't cuz I watch all her videos and I look forward to them so yeah.
iiiiiiiiii
Honestly.. Your new version looks bigger lol. I love it!
I want you to do a gesso testing video where you paint on objects half gesso half white paint and then do a design and see what works better. (I love your videos!) 😊😊😊
I love my dark side but if I leave my bright side then it means I'm leaving u but if I leave my dark side it means I'm leaving jessii idk what to do:[
Ive watched you for years and im now noticing you sound like Steven Universe sometimes LMFAO
its definitely not ok how excited I get at 28 on a Friday night when I realise I have a new video of yours to watch 🤣❤
YAY, ANOTHER VIDEO!!💖💗🥳🥰
Yay another video ☺
I'm so excited. She's sooo close to 6 mil 👏👏
In my country it's literally like 12 am and I have an important test tomorrow and I can't sleep so I decided to watch this.
What if you put mini squishes instead of gum?
New year new intro
Instead of gum you should put small erasers in it
1 day is my b day so i love u
Claim you before 1 mill views here
Thank you !!!!!!!!!!
Definitely love the new version
You woded painted the hole wite
waiting for a painting on rubber ducks ;)
There was legit a bigger in the gum ball machine
Name the bored sloth, Bently.
i have the same bubblegum machine XD
I just realized that during her intro song it says “owa owa”
Glue some colored felt in it that way I still works and it won't be painted
Omg!! Do a TV now :D. (JK. LOL😂)
Omg I love it
Sorry I’m late i pasted out a few minutes before this was posted and just woke up hi! Cool vid btw Edit what is the blue thing on 12:32 and a lil of 12:33?
Love this, turned out so cute. If the inside part bothers you, maybe you could try contact paper. Might be a pain to have to take it apart again but it can be wiped clean and then you wouldn’t have the chipping issue like with paint. Just an idea. Great job!
the most scary ghost : 3:24
I just want to know how many Moriah memes there are 😂
plz paint on a ummmm i hate myself rigth know a ummmmmmmmmmm um a umm cat wait what idk anymore a ummmmm a book im boring ik and idc BI
I knew it.. Moriah never fails to impress me🤧😌
was anyone else impressed when moriah put that thing back together?
At first I was like uh she's gonna paint it rainbow.. .   But it turned out so cute. I love the characters! I love that she used some different characters too. I wish she would show where she is displaying it
I have that very special tool
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE SHRINK PLASTIC IN THOSE WITH ALL THE SQUISHIES YOU CREATED LIKE GEORGIE AND PICKLE
5:02
My first thought was Ice cream cone

Why do i want to see painting on rubbers
𝓗𝓲 𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓼 𝓲𝓼 𝓯𝓲𝓿𝓮 𝓸𝓻 𝓯𝓸𝓾𝓻 𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓻𝓼 𝓪𝓰𝓸 -_-
Hi, sorry I’m late
can we not egnore the fact that the butterfly dragon rainbow character does"t have a bubble gum
wonderfull... but expected to see yr Q and A video..
Lol my cats name is Lucy
Anyone watching in 2021.....???
I have a idea if you have like a small ball pin thing then you can make more but of like different charecters such as cousin derp pickle georgie and others and when you're done with that you can put it in the gumball machine
who likes bubblegum and wants to buy now after the video, like if your one
please do a dog dragon please!!!
am i the only one who heard “owa owa” in the intro? i think i’ve been on tik tok wayy to long!🤣💀
Petition for "Painting on Rubber Duckies" I'll start:  ℱ𝓁ℴℴ𝒻𝓎
PAINT ON THE DUCKYSSSSSSSSS ALSO SHOUT OUT TO QUINCEE AND IZZY PLESEEEEEEE

:-]
Me asking to gobto the thrift store
I love your sweater!!!!! #rainbowsquad!!!!🎨🎨 🍎🍊🍋🍏🫐🍇🍆
concept wise, this is the best yet i think :)
I’ve been looking forward to this for so long! I remember seeing you show this in one of your videos
Are used to own the exact same one for the back of our house burned down and it got broken and they were breaking a window to get the smoke out of her house they also melted some of the paint although I blame that more in the fires in the fire people sidenote I say fire people instead of firemen because I did know that there were two women there as well and don’t feel bad or feel Sympathy for me and my family it’s really not a big deal plus that was back in 2018 I think it was fixed just so you know anyways you can either continue scrolling through the comments or go back to the YouTube video have a good rest your day Or night :-)
Lovin' her outfit :D
Hi
Whenever I have anxiety I watch you and it makes me feel so much better !!!! Love you 💕
Moriah: says "So unprofessional" about changing backrounds Also Moriah: "He looks like he just farted" :3 hehehe just thought this was funny. Moriah, if you see this, thanks for being such an artsy and awesome youtuber and person!
Moriah: Bubblegum machine Me: wait it isn’t a  gum ball machine?-
it is so cute
moriah: so the bubblegum.. My mind: NEW FRAMES NEED ANALYZING. CLICK TO ANALYZE.
Me: ( chewing gum while watching this) : I am 9he with the video
You said that you didn't like the keys on the inside that where you can see the red you could paint over a glass part that you used to open to grab the bubble gum if you wanted 2
omg i love all your things and keep doing what your doing
i LOVEEEE THAT I WISH YOU COULD COPY IT AND I COULD HAVE ONE !!!!!
It adds to the theme of the whole room 👌🏻
I would like to see something with a pink, yellow, and blue color scheme. Specifically in that order
Me at 2:42: do you know how to put it back together tho
Love this video!
I love it
Ppl who guessed it right i got it
Oh wow! A designs she has already done 100+ times....
I love this! You always make me want to try so many new things because you make it look so fun! 😁
I think that it would be so cool if you customize your sticker collection. Anyone else?
Moriah:see u guys next week Me: noohh nohhhhhhhhhh, pls continue the video now😭😭😭😭
I love it so much but you bought the wrong sized gumball you bought mini gumballs when you should have bought standard sized. That's why your gumball machine is giving out to much gum each time Moriah no big deal simple mistake.
Her: no more sound effects. Meme: thank you Me: nooooooo no thank you😶😳
Me: not getting the hint Also me: oh now i get it
Moriah:ITS THE GESSO THAT NEVER ENDDDDDSSSS!!!!(cupcake face)  Me:(changing) Jesus Christ, you scared me with that EVIL laugh XD
The way she put her face in the gesso... that was genuinely terrifying
moriah you should have a song for when you apply gesso to items since you use it alot!
The sloth should be named joe
Am I the only one that thought that she should have made them into stickers and then put them on the inside? Just thought that making stickers would be easier.
omg, a lot of bubble gum. oh dear 😂
*copy and past if you want to see moriah “paint on rubber ducky’s*
I have one of those bubblegum Machine! I thought I was the only one! 😀 like if you have one!
Moriah do you play among us it's so fun
Hi Maria I watched every single one of your videos and I’ve been subscribed to you for five years I loved every single one of your videos thank you for posting
I think Moriah should design masks.
My mum bought a Antique gumball machine once and fixed it filled it with chocolate candy (those lil things that u can get in Easter eggs and in Wal-Mart u know what I'm talking about) and brang it to work and had people at her office have some and all the quarters in the thing was me and my siblings salary for doing chores

Moriah: this is what all bubblegum machines look like we all know it Me: oh really? I havent even seen one so how'd I know
Yesss I have that gum ball machine
My 4th grade teacher had the same gumball machine and gave us a piece of bubblegum when we passed a test or read a million words (Book wise😌)
I know ii
Share some gum with me Moriah...lol jk
So CUUTTTTEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Moriah should do a “Painting A Rubix Cube” video, where she paints one of her characters on each side, COPY AND PASTE THIS SO SHE SEES
girl none of us noticed the background until you said so-
12:31 Why is there blue text? Was this on purpose to emphasize the business of the bubblegum? I gotta contact the -Illuminati- i mean my company about this 👁👄👁
Wow! It came out beautiful (like AlWaYs except the first human girl you did awhile back) <3
I have that bubble gum machine
Gloowy  price sticker should be illegal Mariah 2021~
i am  eating golden oreos
Next time you do one of these "Thrift Store Makeovers" can you paint on that black cat with pink hair I saw in your Art Room Tour video (Like a year ago ;-;)
Rebirth.
👍?
I feel so old since I know what the “tool” she used was
stan moriah for all the effort and time she puts in making us entertained! we stan a queen
U could have used acrylic paint on the glass, and it wouldn't lift the paint with a second layer. You could also just clean up mistakes by scratching them off with a toothpick or tool of some kind when the paint is dry. You could then still use marker or paint pen for details or outlines over acrylic, and varnish would still work to seal and finish at the end.
moriah i emailed you did you get?
.Look at all that space *Bang* ow. Also Nelson
I love all your drawing you inspirer me
This was so creative and it looks so amazing! Keep doing what you do Moriah!
She makes painting just seem so easy!!   Love you Moriah!!! ✨💘
This was a super cute idea Moriah!!! My 7 yr old daughter and I absolutely love your Friday videos. We look forward to them every week. This gumball machine turned out beautifully. The characters are adorable!!!! You are so talented. 😄💕❤💛💚💙💜
Alt Title: Moriah Gives Benson from Regular Show a Makeover

I HAVE A VIDEO IDEAAAAA TRY GLASS PAINTING!! Its basically where you get a glass frame and paint...but backwards! You invert your reference photo, outline it, paint the DETAILS first, then the main colors! It's fun and simple!
Omg so cute  Plz make a OPIE squishe
Cut your hair to your shoulders
FOUR AND A HALF!!! bags of bubblegum.   Share for her to see this
Awwwwwe dang I like the sound effects they’re funny. And by the way I absolutely love your sweater that you’re wearing in the beginning of the video
Sadly I have braces so I can’t have gum but I can put other candies in there
The people with braces that can’t eat gum are the ones who disliked lol😂😂
She should do a video painting her nails
She should do a video painting her nails
Lol my sloth toys name is Burt!:) and love you 😽
She should do a video painting her nails
Anyone from 2 videos ago when every one wanted/demanded her to paint on Rubrics Cubes? Moriah should paint on rubrics cubes and rubber ducks.
You should put pastel gum balls in it
don’t drop it
Hey Mariah  I think I have ani idea for a squishy where you take one of the pink or blue narwhals and make it into a whale if you don't like that idea that's ok
Motiah - in this random color order  Me - *rolling my eyes of course
I'm a girl
Hello cute weird girl
I don’t care what anyone says she is just so funny
Goodwill girl GG our my best best friend
You should do a video where you paint a wooden dollhouse! (Interior as well) 🏠 love your videos btw! ❤️
Lol I love it
ItS THe GESso ThAT nEvER eNds..........

Adorable!!!! 🥰🥰
Her: and then I noticed Ad: NoRmAl TiSsUeS cAuSe YoUr NoSe DrEaD
Who else wants Moriah to do more “Bake With ME”?
I feel like this could get a creepypasta or a scp story because of the coins
I love her videos and for a long time no joke and her paintings are so good even the ones that she does not like
I wonder how it'd work with larger gumballs. I assume that's why you were getting two at a time? Getting more for free is beyond me though.  That's right. I'm going to make a comment without commenting on any of the actual makeover. 🙇
U should of sorted the bubble gum colours
Gum ball machine in the house
She should do a video painting her nails
She should do a video painting her nails
She should do a video painting her nails
Wait I just saw her hand and I thought wait is she a left handy🤔
She should do a video painting her nails
Moriah should needle felt
How old am i O I'm 26  So so what's your point  =most memorable Sentence of 2021
I really want to be like morphia  Elizabeth
I feel like she should try out the ‘black 3.0 paint’ aka, the WORLDS BLACKEST PAINT.
Moriah: he is kinda boring at party’s, don’t invite him   Me: well I was going to... but I guess nvm
When she said her reflection was distracting I was like " Ur reflection is distating bc ur pretty...isnt that obvi?"
12:54 4.5*
Mariah should sort the bubble gum and fill it up to look rainbow
I love your videos, and love this design. I too am not a great fan of the red showing, but totally get why you left it. Thanks for sharing your creations with us.
Omg that yellow paint is 😍😍😍😍😍
Every other youtuber:uses memes Moriah:uses herself as a meme
Moriah for next week can you try and draw anime?
Did anyone else notice her pencil? Oh just me. Ok.
It looks amazing!! And I luv ur vids so so much <3
Love it
the Gum Mashines in Germany doesn't look like that. We have a 2 to 3 piece Mashine. Its rectangle and the glas has a metalnez in front of it because... well german kinds like to steal hahaha
You should have it in the back so when you film your next video we can see it in the back😊🦋✨👑
This was toooooo cute!!!! Make me one please! Lol
PLEASE do a bake w/ meeeeee! You haven’t done one in forever!!!
I love you so much moriah because your so creative and every Friday I am in happy mood knowing I’ll see your amazing art I know you work so hard on your videos and I wish you could post every day by the way happy new year 🎊 xx
Just so you know your gorgeous and I love the bubble gum machine
Im only at 8:41 Somebody please tell me she adds bubble gum in it at the end
It’s my birthday today 😝
why do I have the urge to see cousin derp have a bubble gum bubble popped on his face?
OMG yess I love sloths and it finally happened something that a sloths is on and not just the squishy!!!! Love your videos 💚💚
When is Qna coming
PLEASE MAKE BART INTO A MERCH
We were right, she posted it on her story
I like what she did! But I thought she was going to make it look like earth.
Super awesome! Turned out great
Now I can’t stop looking at the red spot “moriah”
This is the best paint job i've seen in 2021!!! Love itb
Chocolate rainbow Cat
Me and my friend got your merch!!!!
When she hit her elbow I felt that
The cat should be named Lola I don’t no why
It would’ve been funny if you made them holding hands, it would be like a cult!
Me not even noticing the red    Her i dont like the red part but i did not want to paint inside it   Me oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ok you just ruined how it had no flaws     Perfect vid thuagh
rubbing alcohol gets rid of sticker residue really easily! :)
The title says all the passion she has
I have that *exact* bubble gum machine.
I just remember ITS FRIDAAAAAAAAY
Me every friday: can bbn I get a owa owa (moriahs intro)🤣
I really thought she’s gonna paint on a chewed gum 😀
Hiii Moriah! I'm a huge fan and I've watched every single one of ur videos! Also have an awesome day!
It kinda reminds me of a ball pit
Honestly, I would not have noticed the background change if she hadn’t mentioned it...
What you should have done was paint the glass Ike one of the swirly gum ball machines and make pickle and derp sliding down the gumball machine, and by the way I got your merchandise it’s awesome 🤩 good job.but I still like the one you made 🤩🤩😃😂
D u c k s
She is really goood but talks so much
Nelson is my spirit animal
Pls paint rubber ducks And when you clean it you should wear gloves just to be careful
1 penny gives:2 bubblegums 1 quarter gives: 2 bubblegums  FREE:3 BUBBLEGUMS Me:...what-
Hi Nelson

so cute
No one:  no one at all: My mom: IS THAT U AS AN A ADULT
When in doubt: POSCA PAINT PENS
I used to have one of those in my room!
5:24 MINECRAFT IS THAT YOU!?!?
Moriah: “why am I so kinda scared of that hole?” Me: because the rest is colourful and the hole is not. Simple
Fantastic 👏🏻✌🏻 Love your comedy!!
you say in year 2087 "I finished my  gesso  !"
Gum bars ( I like your videos in Charlee language )
When your her #1 fan and your 5 hours late
OK I HAVE TO METION SHE FORGOT TO PAINT THE INSIDE OF THE MACHINE...
Lucy is my name
Maybe paint the little door so you don't see the red inside???
I saw the hint and i was right
I think that glass paint you didn’t like didn’t work too well because you used it on porcelain. I think maybe you should test it on this kind of glass and see if you get the same result.
I WAS EATING OH OH NO ew lol I saw that dust and just ew
I love how she uses herself as memes
I have that exact gum machine
Mariah: it's the jesso  that never ends me: more like it's the jesso that almost never ends
Moriah:this is my icesmorecat terrible name how about-  Me: pauses video hmmmm Lucy unpauses video  Moriah: Lucy
Me: she made it rainbow again- Moria:😏 you know it ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🎨🌈 (Sorry if I spelt ur name wrong 🥺)

I used to watch a lot of her old video's when I was literally obsessed with squishies, I mean obsessed obsessed I literally almost ordered a 20.00 dollar one on AMAZON! Anyways, I was watching a video of her painting a cat then I found a squishy and painted it purple. I thought it was dry so I took it while watching TV then squeezed it multiple times then when I looked at my hand there was paint everywhere on my hands, the couch, and my whole shirt and shorts, oh and btw my Mom said if I ever touched paint or squishies again she would lock me in a room for 2 hours everyday. DONT DO WHAT DID!
i demand a *bert* plushie 😩
Is anyone gonna talk about how it looked like it was a mini one in the thumbnail ._.
Omg i love 5it so much
I love it! Super cute and aesthetic 💖💖
'me wants to trace'  everyone to artists for some reason
Just a friendly notice. not meant to be hate. in your description it says 'pisode' instead of episode. just a notice. please spread so moriah will see
Also Moriah do you support lgbtq rights?
I love your sweater soooooo much!
She used they/them pronouns for the scared chicken. Am I the only one that noticed that?
Pls you so beautiful let me be your friend
Buy Goo Gone to remove stickers. Works every time
Can we just appreciate how pretty her sweater is. I want it and I love it
So cute .. I enjoyed this video, you’re so creative ! 💕 Great job .
I knew it!!
Why would you paint on a bubble gum machine I mean the results fine fine fine fine fine but like I don't really okay you do you okay
her nails match the bubble gums :c
It's for bigger bubble gum 🤣
Can you paint rubber ducks
She is just a inspiring rainbow queen . And I was woundering if you could paint those RUBBER DUCKYS
“me wants to trace” moriah elizabeth 2021

Hear me out...Nelson plush? Maybe?
Mis you soooooooo much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️            You are reading my comment so you have to like my comment 👍
Shouldn't the chicken be sideways like he is floating?
I LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕💓💓💓💓💓💕💓
I knew it was a gum ball machine!!!
I love her sweater.. is it just me?
I love the gumball machine! I would love to have one for my classroom!
i genuinely don’t think i’ve ever seen a gum ball machine ever in real life
0:00 0:01 0:02 0:03 0:04 0:05 0:06 0:07 0:08 0:09 0:10 0:11 0:12 0:13 0:14 0:15 0:16 0:17 0:18 0:19 0:20 0:21 0:22 0:23 0:24 0:25 0:26 0:27 0:28 0:29 0:30 :)
I can't wait to see this in the background of future videos
Omg shes almost at 6m subs😁also love u🥰
and I do not like umog us
You should do a behind the scenes video! Pin and reply if you agree moriah! I would love it!
I ordered one of your crewnecks and they sent me the wrong size
I’d love to see what you would create on rain boots or an umbrella!
Moriah: posts My internet: ight imma head out     Btw I make videos :)
Why don’t you do a paint with me?I miss those videos!
Yesterday I got both of your create this books😊.
I LOVE IT😍 it’s probably my favorite thrift store makeover so far
100% Aaaaahhhh-MAZING!!!!
I have that same thing but it is yellow
"Gewwy price stickers should be illegal NobOdy LikEs yOu" every one agrees moriah
The sloth should be named DAVE like my dad his favorite animal is a sloth and I think it fits him 😄
Maybe the squishy ghost lives in the gesso and magically fills it up for you
The green pin looks like discount aphys
10/10 sound effects
I think this was a good idea I love the design it’s so cute I love it
i love when he side "AA" plz keep doing that
This is ART and WHATEVER ME WILL TOUCH IS ART
3:55 reminds me of the Minecraft soundtrack a little right?  No just me  👌
Welp, you can always use that as a piggy bank hahahaha
7:09 I thought Missy
Everybody is waiting for Nelson merch 🤩🥳
Does it say “new frames need analyzing, click analyze” in a blue bar at 12:33 for anyone else or just me? Then it says something else in another blue bar shortly after that 🤨 it shows up on my tv and my phone lol
Omg 9:48 hahahahahahaha
When I saw it I was like RAINBOW 🌈 🌈 🌈 🌈
Oh my god I used to be obsessed with bubblegum machines with I was little. My brother had a mini mini one with super tiny bubblegum and I was sooo jealous!
I want her sweater
I love u
I love you shirt
AHHHHHH YESSSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
YO I LOVE GUMBALLS AND THIS VIDEO! love you moriah!
Oh *hi*
Moria has fallen in love with a bubblegum machine
Sooo I'm here with a question. It's your opinion. Who was the best president in America that u think ruled the best. Personally I think its Obama but I wasnt even born yet-
Btw for Christmas i got your creat this book
Omg this is amazing im obsessed
OMG GUYS. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A GEORGIE RUBBER DUCKY!!!!!!!!!!! Like if u agree!   👇
Nelson is my dad name!
this is one of my favorite series! along with bake with me and squishy makeovers  wait  those are   the only series but things to do when youre bored  oop
When she said "This should be illegal" I thought of  ssniperwolf
Who else got jumped scared when the chicken screamed...just me 💀
Like if Mariah should do the one coat paint challenge!   Feel free to copy and paste for Moriah to see!
The foregoing court puzzlingly x-ray because cabbage conjecturally increase atop a  freezing chicken. selfish, dazzling soil
❤️
Best
Hihihi
Something really cool be making the house from Up and lines going to the gum balls
Maybe you can put the small Squishies in there
Moriah elizabeth is the best
Moriah: *talking* My POV: wait if the next color is yellow than shes- Moriah: “it’s a rainbow” Me: PERFECT!  Moriah: “oh look at that! 2 for 1 cent!” Moriah: *get 3 for free* Also Moriah: “OH SO U GET MORE FOR FREE THAN WHEN U PAY?” Me: *dies of laughter*
CAN YOU PLEASE BAKE AGAIN!!❤❤❤❤      Your baking is entertaining i don't know why!🤔❤🌈
im gonna say it this is my favorite thrift store makeover EVER! like if you agree
Moriah: Oh Look it's Rosey! Me: *Whose Gacha name is RoseyMoon* ummm...idk how to feel about that-       Why do I feel like Im famous now-
That was JAR-ing and I love that scaired chicken scream. Yes I watch videos just to make puns this got liked while I was editing it like as soon as I commented this so they will POP
Hi there real quick I would just like to make a point the first time you said bubblegum machine at the beginning of the video it sounds like butt hole machine, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, but, it’s just true it just sounded like it!! Leave a like if you agree👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿
Maria: this is going to be very colorful so brace yourself Me and literally everybody else: Maria we've been watching your videos long enough I think we're re used to it
Really loved this!!!
Anyone else notice that she is wearing a rainbow?
The machine gave you 2 because the gum balls are to tiny. You need bigger ones
Moriah: oh the background changed Me: *focussing in the red thing and doesn’t notice it changed Also me: *takes it back just to see what colour it was....
I love the memes their so funny
wait do you live in ohio
You should paint a gumball plz read this comment
Today my new baby sister was born!💕💕💕💕💕
My cats name is lucy
I hope I find a gumball machine at one of my thrift stores
I was wondering where the bubble gum was on Rosie the bashful dragon and then I realized it was purple and she was holding it in front of her body
14k comments already!?!?😹 good job Moriah your awesome and we all think so keep being yourself because that’s what makes you, you!!!! And I love your sound effects lol!

Moriah: But I did get a bunch of skin cells for free! Me: ....
I love how Moriah is so honest with us. I would not have know that the varnish left some small reside. She could have told us everything went perfect but she was true to  from us. That means a lot to me ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

The cats name should be Darcy it would be so cute!!!!
WE STILL NEED GEORGIE! Who thinks that Moriah should get big foam balls and paint pickle + the other characters on them and put them in the gumball machine? like if u agree!
"its the  gesso that never ends"
.______________________________________________________________.
Wow your 2 years younger then my mom 🧑‍🦲👏
Me loves color and I mean me and Moriah

Moriah:In other words Me WaNts To TraCe  Me:Me WaNts To WaTCh MorIaH

Who else wants her to paint on rubber ducks
I think doing glass painting would be soo cool!
2:12 SupEr SpEcIal
Lol my brother lives him and gumball machines btw I had a dream that moriah elizabeth the dyed squishys lol
Guys throughout her videos if the bubblegum thing is in the frame keep an eye out to see how many she has eaten
Pls do more thrift store makeovers like I love them please do more of them you should start like I don't know like a different channel or something all like about drifts or makeovers because I don't know I love them 😁😁
When is Georgie plush coming back
I have the same one!!!

Me right when I click on the vid: I LOVE THAT SWEATER I WANT IT GIVE ME IT
Georgie:am I here???
Anyone else want to see her try and paint gothic? Like no rainbow just dark lol
She should put sprinkles she uses for her art in it as a sprinkle dispenser
My teachers baby is named Lucy
You should get  charms if you characters and put them in the gum ball machine
Mmm I’m chewing gum rn
I love the it!! 👏👏👏
“A nice arengment of colors, in no preticular order” *does it in rainbow with fear.*  Me: it’s ok, it’s tempting I know.
oook i get it the clue now - v -
I love it 😻
Sooo cute love it ❤️
Omg love it
This is one of the youtube channels that kept me sane during covid as well as unus annus(rip) and others
Attendance for everyone who wants to see painting on rubber duck     Thanks for so many likes
The thing that made me mad was that she didn’t clean the Metal part and left it unclean
Omg i loved how the final product turned out!
That looks awesome well done Moriah! I love your videos thanks for making my day and for making me smile!
Why does she say "beautiful arranged colors" Instead of rain***?
Yeeesssss the inside red bothers me tooooo
Beautiful
Her apologising for her childish behaviour: sorry  Me who loves it: keep doing its hilarious
This is aeesome does she have a store
leave a like on this comment if u agree if u want moriah to do another squishybakovers
You should do a Cotten candy video or sum
I dont know why i loved this so much like i just love it a lot
Um...what the heck?! This is cool! :D Also, no hate about the ‘what the heck?!’ Thing! I meant that I’ve never seen someone do this! Unique as always, Moriah!
Literally 99.9% people will not see this but You are awesome and have a great day    Can somebody help me in my channel
You should do challenge where you can't use rainbow colors and have to use more modern colors when painting
I actually have a bubblegum machine just like that but pink. It had bubblegum at some point but I got that a long time ago so I took them out and just use it as decoration now
Premiere rush
i LOVE your vids
I really enjoy watching thrift store makeovers but you have been making squshies lately so im just asking if you could make more thrift store makeovers. Love you!
I love her sweater 🥰🥰
Love your art work and ever since I be been watching I've done some of your work
it suspiciously looks like a        b o o g e r
6:45 Nelson from the simpsons :>    Who else got that?
todqy is my birthday :> she posted on my birthday, best present. thank you moriah!!!
for some reason when she said "the Gesso that never ends" my brain said "welcome to the Gesso California"   why am I like this?
we love being nice and preppy
What is your favourite colour?
Gesso you know gesso with one day take over the world..it never ends...you know that, right?
*sigh*         Somebody please tell me why she has the same nails from 2020 pls we all know what came from 2020 stays in 2020 (except our clothes)................ Hehehehe when she was drawing the sloth it looked like a butt for a second
"Gooey price stickers should be iLleGaL"            -Moriah, 2021
Especially when you're grieving no matter if it's of someone dying or a family member moving away or both thank you for making me happy again Mariah
Where’s Rosie’s gum??????🤨
Can you make a cute axolotl
Moriah makes so many people happy, but she doesn’t know it. But that what makes her special 😍😘 Love ya!!
Dont forget about painting Easter squishies
Who else was waiting all week for a video?
My grandma has that exact same exact same gumbo ball machine that you have
"its the JESSO that never endsSsSsS-" "Hleh helh hleh" *inset creepy face here* Moriah please don't give me any more heart attacks
I think she maybe should have cleaned up or like -oldish Ed the metal part cuz that really bothers me. I understand It’ll be difficult but like it’s so rusty compared to all of the colourful Beaty around it
since nobody asked this question how’s ur day 🥺😭🖐🏻
We love being 4hrs late!       ;-;
whats Up with 12:32 ??? 😭😭
That is so nice you should sell them on you’re merch line I would def buy it!
i think so far this project is my favorite make over!
I love iiiiiiiiiiiiit ♡
Here I’m here!
You should do a video of yourself not editing any part of a video besides putting small clips of it together. Plus there’s a possibility it might just take a little less time than in your average video.
i love her editing she funny
hi
UGA chain :}
My little sisters name is lucy and she was so excited when you said this will be named Lucy.

You my ALL TIME favorite YouTuber!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Moriah:Gooy price stickers should be illegal no body likes you Me: unless you what to no the price
Hhhhhhhoiiiiii
when people have ideas: ItS BeEn MaRiNaTiN In My MinD
Does anybody else watch all the ads that come before and during her videos just so she gets the money? Or is that just me?     If you don’t know what I mean then here is an explanation: The percentage of people who skip ads heavily impacts YouTubers' revenue as YouTube does not count skipped ads as a view. Advertisers don't pay for skipped ads, and therefore creators do not get paid for viewers who skip ads. If a YouTuber has an audience made of people who always skip ads, they won't earn as much.
I was watching the video and then a candy crush add came that had Moriah in it😳
Soooo y’all know that one gurl who is like a drawer and always promote her channel make this comment have more likes than hers
When I have the worst day I know exactly where to come!

Moriah: It is very colorful  Colorblind people: Am I a joke to you?
Her:Its a little mini gumball machine    Me:Uh MAM look again
The gum-ball machine looks so cute!!!
MORIAH! Instead of painting inside the gum hole thingy(dispenser) paint on the lid of it, like something that shows "here you go" soooooo ye, just an idea   You dont have to use it if you dont want to. 👌🏼
IM PICKLE AND I LOVE MORIAH AND GORGIE
Moriah: I was not doing my best work here Me: WHAT!! It looks so good!!

i thought she was painting a gum wrapper when she gave hints-
At 3:53 was I the only one who heard driver’s license playing in the background and started like AND UR PROBABLY WITH THAT BLOND GIRL then realize it was just filler music.       Just me? Ok
OMG IS IT JUST ME OR YOU SHOULD MAKE BUBBLE GUM SQUISHIES TO PUT INSIDE AHH CUTEE
Moriah: finds something in the video she doesn't like Also Moriah: zooms in on it
Just me that wants to see her paint tiny gum ball squishy to put in it
Me:  MY mom:  Moriah: ✨BoY YoU GoT  A dIrTy GuM HoLe✨
Hi Moriah so I was thinking..... What if you took a month for a squishy makeover video! You take all the squishies you want to paint and take a month to do a bunch!! I know its kinda weird but just a suggestion.
That is too cute! By far my favorite that you have done. That was also a lucky find. I have been looking for one for my classroom for awhile that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.
The sloth can be Bernie. Giving me Bernie Sanders meme vibes
I always wait every Friday hey it's my I want to be an artist cuz she's like kinda a artist I quest
10:19 beast boy?!????
For anyone reading this comment, Have a wonderful day!!
Moriah: now all i have to do is varnish them and make them strong and healthy.   Me: WhAt So YoU aRe tElLiNg Me ThAt ThE pAiNt CaN gEt CoViD??
Mariah: Gooey stickers should be illegal!  Me: Are you the next Sssniperwolf?!
5 yr old me  gum hole 🤣.......38 yr old me gum hole 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
People who saw her hint: (☞’◡’)☞
can I have it, please
needed this today, got my wisdom teeth out yesterday and she always makes me feel better 💜💜
Moriah!!! You should put your erasers in the bubblegum machine!!!
“I have not tested if it works or not” (questions her life) “I’m going to paint it first”
I always seem to forget it’s Friday.
Can we just talk about how UNPROBLEMATIC she is like- wow ❤️❤️

It's a shame Pumpy got overpowered by Georgie, he's just as cute!
OMG that was SUCh a GOOD video Moriha I LOVED IT
IM UR BIGGEST FAN😭😭😭✋✋✋
I watched this at 12 am and I immediately  woke up my mom
Can you do drawing random things
Hi
⚠️Dog in pool float, bear holding cake, frog prince, and dragon twinnnnnn!!!!!!! Also you could make a latte for each of your characters like you did for pickle!! Also could you decorate a deck of cards?! Also hehe sorry painting rubber ducky series?! Painting a Rubik’s cube with a character on each side?! Heh sorry just giving suggestions😅⚠️
Hi!!! I have your create this book Moriah!!!
Yass love it😋
looks like everybody guessed it
12:32 wait a min..... what’s that?
You should make a WHOLE bunch of mini squishy’s and put them in it
can you PLEASE do another baking video? I LOVE THEM! ily! also i have a volleyball tournament tomorrow wish me luck!

Pls do a poop with candy or cake plsssssssssssss I'm begging u u never look at my comments plssss
Can you do more baking videos??
Is it weird I own that gumball machine?!
Anyone else notice Rosie doesn’t have a bubble gum?
I love your videos but my ADHD for some reason makes me have to turn the speed up to 1.5X and IDK why 😂 Love the 🌈 Rainbow~!
I thought this was an old vid 🤣🤣🤦🤦
I cannot describe how much I hate the words "Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you next week! Bye!" Cuz it means another week of waiting for a new video :/
Yay I guessed right!! Also to cover up the red I would probably glue paper or something inside so it’s sanitary and pretty.
One like is something to do for BeRT
Moriah u should do a video we’re u paint a mask. Since it’s COVID 19 session.
you could probley turn the bubble gum holder into a fish tank just letting you know
Moriah: The bored sloth is no fun don’t invite hi to party’s. Me: He already received a invite oops-
Mushy Brain
Moriah: it looks suspiciously like a booger   Me: that looks more like earwax
You could add a little paper runway on that little red inner part to make it match the outside. Or you could paint it and cover it with some clear contact paper
Hi Moriah i love you ,are my favorite youtuber!!! :)
I love It so much
My cousin's bubblegum machine works without money too 🤣. It's because the bubble gum balls are too small 🤣
11:18 Oh sheet, it's Deku.
Pls paint on rubber ducks!
The characters look so cute. Who agrees ??
She should paint on wooden spoons
Moriah: "JUST GET THAT OUTTA THERE"
I knew it
I didn’t know Moriah is 26 lol
She should do an animated series for all of these characters she creates!
Your kinda so crazy
Moriah: I hope u liked it  me: Liked? O.o i- LOVE It
Oh my gosh from your hint on what this video would be, I thought you’d be painting with gum. My thoughts were far away from thrifting a gum ball machine. 😂
Moriah: I found a little surprise here in the corner, i'm hoping its bubble gum, it looks suspiciously like a booger Moriah loving germaphobe: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ew ew ew aghhhhh
Hey Moriah,  I think I have an idea for a project. You should create your own comic series! (I you want obviously)
You should have use chalk markers. Some brands are good on glass
Moriah: This will just keep my paint strong and healthy   Me: Paint can have muscles??
Uhm prob not gonna see this- but my b-day is tomorrow just wanted to ask if you could make a sloth themed squishy or something but if u dont its totally fine just a request-
Who agree she should do more tie dyeing for 1 hr 🦋 or costmizing or panting for an 1hr 🥰
It’s so funny that voiceover Moriah can’t tell what regular Moriah was trying to do lol
Next “painting on things” Painting on rubber ducky’s!!! ( I know we are all waiting for that)
Do more rainbow there’s never enough rainbow 🌈 🤩
i want nelson merch copy and paste if u agree
hi
i wish u posted more i need MORIAH ELIZABETH
She could have made one stuck to the glass by bubblegum
You could use mr super clear...
who and what kind of psychopath DISLIKES MORIA'S VIDEOS???????????
I don't know if this is a lot but if you couldn't do another squishy makeover can you do like a birthday side squishies
LOL 😂😂
Her: Bubblegum Machine Me: GUMBALL MACHINE Her: Bubblegum Machine Me: GUMBALL MACHINE! Her: Bubblegum Machine Me: *GUMBALL MACHINE!!!!*
In her short she stayed she's painting something different and she was right
Hi i love your videos
I love this
I love it so muchh
ITS A JESOOOO THAT NEVER ENDS!!!🎼
If she didnt  post this Friday I'd be sad
I love all your art it’s beautiful and watching your videos makes me happy and makes me laugh I’m zahlia btw
That is amazing I'm so happy i subscribe to you.
Maybe you could have used window colours for the characters. That way you only would have to stick them on there. But I still love the result 😊
why am i know realizing that when she says ''hey guys its me''  that when she says me it stands for Moriah Elizabeth
Moriah your the best
i love the way the thing turned out
Moriah: "And that's when I realized......" Commercial: "We both got spectrum mobile, so we both got game!!!" 😆😆😆 That fit in so perfect I had to share it!!
I'd love to see you try nail art
Don't get me wrong I love you but some times you creep  me out
You could have outlined the designs on the metal
i have that exact same one i got ages ago
Can u do a video of all your memes or some of the memes since u probably have a lot? plssssssssssssss
Hi
the sloth's name should be Itsukushima Tsuki fro short, you know cause Tsuki has that expression
I like the finished piece though
I watched your hint video, and the only thing I could think of was a bubble gum themed squishy, I never would have guessed a gum ball machine 😱🤗🤔
Moriah you don’t understand how long I was waiting for this makeover you are the best tysm
that was one of the cutest episodes ever
I LOVE YOU MORIAH!!!!! You r so wonderful and amazing!!!!!!!!
Now I want gum 👁️👄👁️
I'm here before 1 million views
3:22 yes it paints on and on my frienddddd
You could make the "bubblegums" for the inside too. Like... decorating ping pong balls
I have the same gum all machine!
I love your videos
Me:Eating a tune fish sandwich while watching this. Also me:Realizing this isn’t the first time I’ve watched her videos while eating a tune fish sandwich...
nobody: Moriah's desc: "Today is another pisode"
Anyone else just LOVE her shirt
*do a series of painting rubber duckies*     *Btw I've been noticing that you post videos Friday usually at **4:13** idk if it's just me or a quincidence*
her weirdness is special
Omg I had one of those. I totally forgot about it
Hi ME! Can you do a epoxy resin keychain art?
This is one of my favorite makeovers!
Oh, look, rainbow!  It looks nice but, come on, Moriah, get out of your comfort zone once in a while.
No, do invite Burt! He can be boring and still appreciate the invite
I have the same gum machine!
The red is okay, it's just the red carpet that your bubblegum struts down for the paparazzi!
My thrift store never has this stuff! :(
You should paint an aquarium next i have tried it
Hey Moriah love you!

Am I the only one that doesn’t notice the background changes until Mariah points them out?
Personally I liked the gum ball machine base unblended. Just me? Ok

Lol, I like how she makes memes out of her old or resent video’s.
Thank you. You inspired me to get a  jewelry box and paint it and yes don't wory I putt pickle the dinosaur on it thank you🦕🦖
How has nobody made a theory that she's LGBTQ+?

I hope y'all are having an amazing day🥰 In love your art!!!
Great project!
Moriah looks soooo much like Dua Lipa
Slightly upsets me that you didn’t pay the inside of the shoot or the metal part at the front 😅

When it has 69k likes😳
I can't explain it but something about Moriah calling it a bubblegum machine instead of a gumball machine fills me with anger
Moriah: i dont think i have to apologize for my weirdness o think we're all used to it by now    "new fans has left the chat"
Your so talenteddddddd! Love your videos!💞
Sub to my channel or I cri <3
Imagine getting a liked comment by Moriah

HOW
I love Fridays. It’s the day before the weekend and it’s when she posts. 😁😁😁
Me: "Does anyone else sigh when she decides to put more rainbows on things" Everyone else: "Nope" No way" "How dare you!" "NO" Me again: Oh welp just me then
Please use the shushing clip more, I was cackling like a witch. 😂
Love this ❤❤🔥🔥🔥

TBH, I've never met one of these thing bfore
MY COUSIN DERP AND PICKLE SLIPPERS JUST ARRIVED!!!
Idea: find the oldest things you have, make a multimedia abstract art, and see what you can make. Like find as many items you can to make a mixed media board. Credit: Phoebe Buffey from Friends. 😂
When she said “I don’t think I need to apologize for my behavior I think ur all used to it by now” felt that tbh

Imagen if u tried it befor u took it apart
hi i tried to be early
First
Moriah, please paint a custom wall that shows the drips from your intro. That would be cool.
I’ve never heard them called bubble gum machine, I’ve only ever heard them called gum ball machines
I missed Georgie on the design

I was gana say if she doesn't paint on the glass that would be sad

I cannot put in words how much I love this woman she is just such an inspiration and she makes me laugh every Friday, and I love her style, and she’s so confident and weird and just YES
WHY NO GORGIE OR DURP OR PICKLE
i mean we could just put the sprinkles in the machine..
Give me some gum I’ll send you my address
One time I found a bubble gum machine at Goodwill it was a bit different it was like tall it had like a stand so I like a pole that it was put on top of and we have it in our house and we filled it up with gum it's like you don't need a quarter for it like you just turn it there is still a quarter hole but like you don't need a quarter
You have too shake the paska pens so they can work.
when I saw your hint I was like... "she's going paint gum?!?!?!"
Thump nail: don't worry the gumball machine is small Accual thing: hi im the child of the hulk's gumball machine
Hey Moriah!!!!! Could you do a Q&A soon? Love your videos!💕
Now looking at my plain old red one in my kitchen is depressing....♥️
Wait I though you were going to do a s Squishy makeover
Yo Moriah, You forgot to add the "E" in episode . Not that big of a deal but i thought id tell u :)( in ur Description)
Is that how bubble gum machine look like?
Moriah: I'm just going to do something simple. (does a rainbow ombre) Me: How?
Moriah: goes into baking sale Everyone there: Oh dear.
Haha
The gesso is like food I don’t like... it’s never completely gone
**Me thinking she is doing it fast when she puts it in fast forward** **her putting it in normal mode** Never mind-
I just wanna say my brothers name is Nelson so when I heard her say his name  I fell of my couch XD
It’s my birthday today :)
Lol we knew it.     That post blew it 😂
I just lost my dog today that we had for 16 years and this video really helped me feel better I really lover your content it’s always the best can’t wait for the next video☺️
Do u like my sis drawing it my profile pic she made it for me because my drawings are bad.hope u do!😅

I’m sad she didn’t do pickle 😔
please do more squishy painting pleaseeeee
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Moriah, you are the best person I could think of but when I watch you vid I get sad because I have to wait another Friday to see a new vid and to me that’s like 12 years
super cute creat more of thoes carecters#more
Has anyone else noticed that the description says "Today is another PISODE from my series...." Insted of "Today is anoter EPISODE of my series...." Idk i just thought it was kinda funny.
i was thinking what if instead you made a new series when you use that when its full of minie squishies and each one you get you have to paint?
Super cute
If you sold this, I’d buy it
Love videos
6:39 the pin looks like melvin from captian underpants.
who else wants more cooking vids
Don’t lie who has been waiting for another thrift store episode
Damn girl! It looks AMAZING! Absolutely love it 😍
When she hit her elbow on the table l just hit mine😁😂😱😭
If you have sticky contact paper or something like that, you can cover the inside with that so the red part doesn't show.
When people can come over again don’t tell them I get it for free and they give u money
Fun fact: *when you say fun fact people read ur whole comment* Just kidding! Well it’s true but wathever here is wut I wanted to say:  Everyone one (yes IT IS TRUUEE) wants Moriah to paint on Rubik cube (that is my original idea, commented on the fizzy paint video) and paint on rubber ducks
Omg I love your video this was amazing 😍
theres no rainbow today only arrangements of colors in no particular order
no one: Moriah: this is where i thought it would be the most valuable real estate Me: iT’s fReE rEaL-eStAte
That cats name should be Cassie
On the first day of Friday Moriah gave to me  A new vid to laugh at  So she is the best YouTuber
Guys I wish everyone would stop demanding for rubber ducks and for other stuff, and just let Moriah decide. This is HER channel and its supposed to be a surprise each week, instead of just demanding what we want and getting it. :) Just wanted to throw that out there :)
That came out really good my favorite one sloth to
𝚒 𝚠𝚊𝚗𝚝 𝚝𝚘 𝚝𝚊𝚔𝚎 𝚊 𝚖𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚜𝚊𝚢 𝙼𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚊𝚑 𝚒𝚜 𝚜𝚘 𝚝𝚊𝚕𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚍 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚒𝚜 𝚜𝚘 𝚋𝚎𝚊𝚞𝚝𝚒𝚏𝚞𝚕!!!
My favorite part is always the outlining
SO CUTEEEEE
Moriah ur gum ball machine should have tiny squishies for bonus squishies and it will be used full
Moriah its an amazing video as always!!!
Literally every Friday the one thing I look forward too is Moriah Elizabeth uploading  and it just makes my day even better I hope you see this Moriah :D love you <3
Omg how cute I want iiiittt
Plz do a behind a sences
She says yodaloop what does that mean!?
Can you please make it a tradition to share all of your Moriah memes at the end of every year. I wanna see them ALLLL!!!!🙏🙏🙏
I love it
Was anyone else triggered by the gumhole still being red and her not painting it??!
SHE DIDN'T PAINT THE GUM HOLE THE BRIGHT RED DOESN'T GO WELL WITH THE PASTEL RAINBOW MORIAH
can you make that panda that you got in your last video in to a....egg
Me: dose not see reflection  Moriah: mentons it Me: I DID NOT NOTICE NOW IT IS DESTRACTING  (Edit: I am putting all my comments to the video in the this comments comment place 👀👀👀)
😍😍😍
Late Ik Ik Ilysm Moriah SO CLOSE TO 6mmmmmm congrats queen
Did anyone else notice that when she put the quarter in the gum balls matched her nail polish???
I have the same gum ball machine!!!!!
Words i thought i never hear moriah say   "Me wants to TrAcE" Shivers down my spine 😖
who wants to see painting on rubber ducks |
Wen she went the Jesso that I can’t stop thinking about the face
What if instead of  painting the inside where the where the bubblegum goes you could paint that little plastic part that goes over it you can paint that white maybe? Just a suggestion
3 hours ago
Oh look at that a family gathering! And the other ones.  Me: oh I came!
I HAVE THAT SAME ONE!
Me when I see the bubble gum machine: ... I’m hungry somehow  Normal people: well this is new
Moriah is so funny 😂 😂😂 and she is so good at painting and drawing ❤️❤️❤️
You know what also would have been cool, if you made the bottom and hat as the ocean and the glass with fishys :3 but what you did is also cute and i love it :D
You should sell this on your shop
Moriah: “This thing definitely got a makeover” Me: oh
To avoid seeing the red on the inside you could just paint the top of the lid.  Also, sidenote, I had one of these machines sitting in my room for years. I dont think mine worked though. 🥺
I wish it was every Monday and Friday 😭
hi
Moriah: puts pink at the top me: ah yes... PASTEL BLENDY RANBOW
I love this so much! Keep up your wonderful work. I love your videos!
Every single day that I watch her I always laugh!
Of course the bubble gum machine is going to be rainbow lol I mean I like it it’s pretty
This is so cute!!!!
Hi you are so good at drawing and painting and everything i love your  channel and have a nice day❤
1:32 espically in the gum hall😅
Amazin
who wanted to get tag by her its litterly our dream😂
When I see her actually being mature and trying to make a some-what tutorial video: Oh yeah, I forgot we did that here!
Mariah: ESPECIALLY THE GUM HOLE Me: 😄😂🤣....😵
What is a bubblegum machine 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
OMG Morris painting something she actually uses  lok
Idk if I’m more excited to see the painting or the new sweater every week.😄
It is really cute
When everyone’s done with among us Moriah: “Drawing/creating among us characters!”
i love how goofy the commentary is :D
:)
No one:     Me: CRYING CUASE I WANT ONE
When in doubt, PoSca PAiNt peNs
Me: *Sees bounceyball machine* Me: Ooh yumm bubblegum *buys one, bites it.* : |
Nelsen, looks like he’s Nevel from Harry Potter (sorry for spelling)
I love her videos she has gotten my through so much and she always makes my day better
Attendance for everyone who wants to see "Painting among us characters"
You should paint a chess board (+chess pieces) ♞▀▄▀▄♝▀▄
*asks about it* "That just LOOKED like a screeching SOUND"
My mom got me a cousin Derp onesie from your shop for Christmas it arrived 3rd week of December and I am in love. Your products are so cute
Everyone: oh Gumball machine Me: her sweater is so nice and pretty
THIS IS SO GOOD! IDK WHY BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!
cute!
0:35 I'm sorry, but I laughed so hard when she hit her elbow on the table and idk why 😂
Nobody:   Me: I HAVE THE SAME GUMBALL MACHINE AS MORIAH!!! IM SO SPECIAL
Moriah: Dont wanna pop that bubble    Also moriah: why didn’t I draw anyone popping a bubble
Ty for making me happy every fridayyyyyy
Put all your charms in it
I’m currently wearing almost exactly that sweater and it’s very odd 😳
is it just me or all bubblegum/bounceyball machines red?
hiii!!!! I know Moriah isn't going to see this but HI!!!!
when moriah says the gesso that never ends me XD
I am the sloth, I’m lazy, bad at parties, and super negative, oh wait i think I just found my spirit animal.🦥
To whoever sees this I hope you’re well and hope you day is good 😌
Im disappointed that she didn’t paint on actual gum🤡
like half of her memes are from the cupcake video
Is it just me that wanted it to be a fish bowl but I still love the result.
Maybe... 🤔 you could put little tiny squishy in the machine! 🤯
YOU NEED TO DO ANOTHER MAKING YOUR SQUISHIES INTO A DESSERTTT
Gesso is very similar to white acrylic paint, only thinner. It dries hard, making the surface more stiff. Gesso prepares (or "primes") the surface for painting, making the surface slightly textured and ready to accept acrylic paint. Without gesso, the paint would soak into the weave of the canvas. - Google   I know you've been having some suspicions about gesso, so hopefully, this will clear things up.
I saw your ad it was nice.
Moriah: I don't know what I'm doing in there, I think I'm being a FiSh??? that had me 🤣🤣
Who eles thought when they clicked on this video that she was gonna so the exact same thing she did- ;—;
I'm I the only person who calls it a gumball machine or there is other people
You should paint on high heels since you don’t wear the shoes you paint
if you think about it the sloth is kinda like eore from winnie the pooh
I want to put a gumball machine in my room :(
We where right 😌
❣️❣️
Now she asked to drawl a picture of cousin Derp getting bubble gum out of the bubble gum machine
I LOVE it😍👍🥰
Moriah you inspire me SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!! You are amazing i have painted my own squishies.I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS.CAN YOUR  NEXT VIDEO BE ALL PANDA BUNS!!!???

Can you do another sloth name Douglas  but instead of him playing with the gum him holding  sloth name slowpoke  as a squishing please :) 🤗😁🍕✨
You should paint the metal part like a gold/brass color! It would look really cute!

Petition to make gooey stickers illegal
I love how she uses her own memes to make it fun 🤣
Love it!

It’s amazing! I love it!
Trueeee
I never thought that you would make my day so much, today my friends ditched me and you made my day
I want to see painting on like COVID masks
unique
Nice job on it. That's really cool.
it looks so good! thank you for working so hard to keep us entertained!  you are so good and talented at what you do!  have a good weekend!
You could do a marble painting technique (dipping marbles in paint and rolling on a canvas) using gum balls
As soon as I saw the notification I immediatley KNEW that it would be the bubblegum machine!
petition for Moriah to paint: -rubber ducks -a rubik’s cube -a fishbowl 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  lol
Bubblegum machine! Wait there is no gum emoji?
best video yet :)
You should do a instagram followers choose the squish I paint
Moriah: I definitely don’t want to do any shading Me: *shooketh*
umm, you haven't used sprinkles in like 8 videos??! who are you and what have you done with Moriah???!!!

"looked" like a screeching sound
Were is your cat sorry I forgot his name  I miss him
I've been seeing this for 3 days now how is it 3 hours ago?!-
Every day it's not friday, Me: "where's my favorite youtouber at?"
Today my friend bday she posted in the chat to
12:40 this why we *always* check the reviews.
Hi Me it’s okay if you don’t see this but I wanted to let you know that I found out about you a few days ago I love your channel I showed it to my mom and she likes it as well thanks for posting every week and I also just found out yesterday you have merch I have looked at it and I love it though I am wondering the quality on those things because every time I buy something for school it gets worn out by the end of the year
Tbh, the gumball machine could be a fish tank, lol
Moriah: Posts Everyone else: YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I love the way that her stuff turns out it is always so cute and she is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
The best part of  Moriah's vids are when she points out things that you dont notice and then you start staring at them.
Almost every video has rainbow..WHY
i think the machine meant buy 1 get 2 free ╰(*°▽°*)╯
They are so good they look like stickers 😱😱😱
Moriah, ya never fail t put a smile on my face. I kept rewindin at parts just because it's so funny. I love this, it's probably my favourite makeover yet! :D
i only saw the reflection when you told me were it was.
Hey can you do it like  thrift store Thursday
oh look there was a lovely cupcake in the gesso
Love your sweater
I want her other 5 bags of bubble gum. I love your vids!!
You could use edible paint to paint a bag full of the spare ones! 😁
“Utilize the transparent nature of our substrate.... In other words, *mE wAnTs To TrAcE* “
I personally think Albus would be a great name for the bored sloth 🦥
Everyone guessed correct
SHES ALMOST AT 6 MILL OMG- OMG OMG❤️❤️❤️
I think this is the best project shes done ever 😳😍😳😍😳😍
I asked my mum to buy the same art saplies as you because I want to be like you 😂💕💕
“Abundance of dead skin cells free” the sarcasm 📈
Idk why, but this one makeover might be my fave thrift store makeover you have done yet. It just is so cuteeee! I think I’m in love 😻
I have won and it is so dusty pl
People watching u but this is their first vid they see like:    WHO IS SHE Y AM I HERE Y IS SHE HERE REEEEEEEEEEEEEE me: ya I'm used to ur behavior.............
I have an idea about the red on the inside!! Paint the thing that covers the part where they fall!!! I love ur videos! They always make me smile
Hey just a question. What's your Hogwarts House? I just wanna know. You don't have to answer.
my week  MONDAY: nothing TUESDAY: nothing WEDNESDAY: nothing  THURSDAY: nothing FRIDAY: MORIAH
Nobody: Literally Nobody: Moriah: Oh hello Scared chicken: BUACKACK!
I have an idea for the machine you could put little papers if it works and pick out who can give you a package sense you have emails you can picks some and put papers and choose one every vid then email that person but you don’t have to show the emails? Just email that person or just say there name I mean idk it’s an idea..
It is cuz those bubblegums are tinyer than big ones that are usually in there lol
I love it how she makes her own meme
We need a Moriah meme compilation
Omg I’m EARLYYYYYYYYYYY 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂👍👍👍😜🥰🥰🥰 I love you moriah and your channel 💕😜💕❣️❣️❣️
Nobody: Moriah: bOy YoU gOtA DiRtY  gUm hole Me: STTTTTTTAAAAAHAHHAHAHHH
"When in doubt, posca paint pens!" - Moriah Elizabeth 2021 😂
i would love to see Rosie merch, she's just so adorable!! 🥺
My friend said an awesome idea! She said u should make a collection of fake bubblegum with ur characters on them until the machine is full!!
Didn’t Bert have a name?
make more tik toks please
I know this is what it was!!!
I remember the first time she said “hay it’s me” 🥺
Fix the unfixable
Yesterday Was my birthday 1'21-2011 to do
That woulda cost like $20+ at my local goodwill lmao
That farting green monster does kind bother me
I love Moriah’s sweater so much! 😍
Yayyyy I got it wrong
Moriah: "Its ThE GEssO ThAT neVeR EndS"  Me: *gets musical theatre flashbacks*
Oh and by the way can you go to moana's well I think moana's mumu channel and I've made a few squishies and you might want to check it out wait don't do that please don't
:T
Posca pens are amazing but take sooooooooooooooooooooooooo long to activate
Me before watching video: *thinks I’m not gonna crack up during this video* Also me: *remembers that I ALWAYS laugh in a Moriah Elizabeth video* Me after watching video: *choking because I was laughing to hard in this video*
Oh my God she got another Medicare
Hey my name is Lucey too that's cool how you named that cat my name and guess what I love sloths
Oh SPEAKING of farting out bubbles, my Elf on the Shelf did that.
New frames need analyzing. click analyze

I think this is probably one of my favourite makeovers so far💜💜💜
Put all of your keychains in bubble-gum machine please 🥺
MY MOM IS 26!!!
He reminds me of Alphys from Undertale.  Edit: Nelson does. Nelson reminds me of Alphys.

Finally,  30 points if you have seen the shows.   Comment what needs to be commented  How many points do you have?
Desc: 'Hey guys! Today is another pisode '
The sloth that is not amused with life should be named “Jeff”. It just fits. Don’t ask me why. It just does.
I cant belive that people hate on her >:( shes one of the funniest people I know and she's putting all her effort into this channel and shes getting hate?!?! Shes trying her best people!!! So stop hating on her!
WHY DO YOU LEAVE OUT INDIGO  HE WANTS TO BE ACCEPTED  No hate lol  But really Don’t forget indigo  Or else  ❤️
she did so o on that like wow
Who evers reading this have a great day 😊
Yaaaaas
Wow you don't look 26     Edit: that was a complement btw
You should make a bunch of tiny Panda buns to put in it
Okay but where’s that sweater from its so cute
Oh my gosh I have been wanting to see scared chicken more
TOMORROW IS ME BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I used to have one but mine had legs and feet!
You should buy those little toy compartments and put ideas of what to do (something to paint, trend, etc..). Then, put all of them in the machine, and BOOM when you don't know what to do, twist it.
PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS PLZ
Wow- Xd
I was so off
It’s missing a piece you can buy online that only lets it turn if there’s a coin in it
🌈🍑🍊🍋🍏🍇rainbow
Lol
Warm up or freeze stickers to remove them more cleanly. Also your ads are annoying.
I love the design your amazing!!
Does Moriah live in Canada? The coin looks like a Canadian penny.
Yep
I wish I could draw like you
Love u Moriah ❤️❤️ From india ❤️❤️
i use to have that same one
Amazing! Best video yet!!! I absolutely loved it!!😱🥰🥰
Who else thinks Moriah is the best person ever?
I HAVE BEEN WIATING FOR THIS
Omg I really love this, i was a but sceptical at first about painting on the glass but it looks so amazing !!! <3
There’s me Listening to sono chi no kioku **moriah posts this** Me: sorry Jotaro but ur gonna have to wait for now
13:45 Moriah if it bothers u why didn’t you paint OVER the glass? 🤔No hate, just wondering 😊
last thing I expected today
Haii Moriah can you continue the bake with series? Pleasee I miss it
You are amazing
totally love it
This is everyone who wants to see her paint her apples all of them  | | ^
Btw the reason it doesn’t need money is probably because there’s a few pieces on the inside that u can take out to make it free (I did it for my sisters)
she could totally paint the rubber ducks and then paint on something to put them in/on and georgie could be a parent
Can you do a painting like Vincent Van Gogh all painterly?😁
Hi Moriah I know you probably won’t read this but your videos have got me through some difficult patches in my life when I felt like giving up thank you xxxx you’re the best and my favourite YouTuber
Lucy looks more like a Lulu or Marcy for me   also im suprised you didnt include Cupie! she would fit well here
This video was posted 3 hours ago and it has 63k likes
Have you ever tried to use a soft sponge to blend? Might be faster and make it easier to do on uneven surfaces
Put in some of your small squishies
i went to watch this when it was only 20 minutes old but I got busy
pls pls pls do more baking vidoes
My mom has this exact gum ball machine only its yellow
AMAZINGGG (also I noticed the dragon-fly thing didn’t have gum?)     Edit: ohhh now I see it nvm-
Thrift makeover idea: Buy an existing painting and incorporate your characters
wait- I just noticed your left handed! I’ve been watching your channel for like 3 years ( that sounds creepy but I’m not a stalker I promise, I adore your artwork and you yourself! Because your videos just make me so happy ) BUT HOW DIDNT I NOT NOTICE YOUR LEFT HANDED!
NeLSoN
hey Moriah, have you ever considered lightly sanding your larger blocks of paint afterwards on items like this? It will smooth the surface and remove texture!
So cute but I wish you’d done like a white coat over the metal part!!
Loved it
I just came back from school and the first thing I see is this and now I'm watching this
That Gumball machine in the thumbnail I’m like *I HaVe ThAt* lol
There are glass posca pens
I’m sad I wanted Fred
This is SO CUTE! Quality work! ☀️
You know I was feeling so depressed this past week but when you released this video I promise you actually made me feel better
In the beginning I said I bet you she is going to use rainbow and 10 seconds later a rainbow😂 I love how it turned out
I have the same bubble gum machine!!! :0
The sloth looks so cuteeeer
I was having a really bad day today but this just brightened up my day ❤️💗
I know I'm late but I could find your vid that was 30 sec Posted But My charge went out so I think I'm really early? :((((( :)))))
I love your videos and you are so good at this.🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Am I the only one who gets overly exited when I see that she uploaded??
Really great fun!
I JUST GOT GEORGIE AND PICKLE AND COUSIN DURP FOR MY BIRTHDAY And at school I was carrying Georgie around and when I walked by people everyone screamed GEORGIE
This turned out so cool!!
When you want to comment something because it’s early but you don’t know what to put 😂😂😂😅😅
Your you how's it hard to blend
She is so good 😍
Do another fixing the unfixible
My cat was going crazy and then I sat him down and had him watch this and he calmed down lmao
At 2:11 I was wondering where to get that special tool
This is a big yes!!
Moriah: Oh a penny! I guess this only cost me $6.98 Me: you gotta love Moriah and her cheesy jokes.😂
Spam "Painting On Rubber Ducks" in the chat so she does it.
Almost 6M am so happy for you 🥰
I have to be in quarantine and she made my day much better☺
Am I the only one who realized that she is left handed or do I not pay attention enough.
YOU SHOULD MAKE BLANKET MERCH
Moriah saying it’s a LITTLE gum ball machine- it’s bigger than your head! I had a tiny gum ball machine if you call that small- I still love your tho- sorry I’m late
whow its rainbow its so "different"
I love your sweater!
Hya Barbie pls reply
Do another squishy makeover
Moriah: you can see my reflection on the glass..... that’s distracting. Me: 👁👄👁 yes it is
You could use this for your wheel chooses challenges for your squishes! I guess it wouldn't be wheel chooses anymore
THIS, is why I live for Friday’s
Me: Sees Moriah putting Red, Orange, and Yellow colors for each characters bubble gum.  Me: Knowing where's she's going with it...  Moriah: Hoping no one would notice :/
Never stop making them
I love your videos
Just so you know moriah, those things brake      really easy
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
:) Love ur vids
This was a wonderful video. Thank you Moriah!
Yay I love you Moriah
I thought you were making more not juar one
THE MACHINE IS NOT WACK, IPTHE BUBBLE GUM ARE SMALL AND IT’S FOR LARGER SIZED ONE, LIKE THE ONE AT DOLLAR STORE.
I think if u painted the inside and cotted it with a coat of varnish and then it won't chip. This is just a guess BTW
I had that exact same gum all machine.......... I shook it with jelly beans in it and it shattered🤫😂🤣
Me: Image being moriahs squishys on the shelf   the squishys on the shelf every day: :0
Im at 5:34 and i think shes gonna make a donut on the top edit: i was wrong
Who can not wait until the gesso end I will cry if the gesso ends  though
Her intro just remindinds me of OWA OWA Yk?
Image of you accidentally painted them upside down
Please say hi. Todays my birthday.
# LOVE IT
I Haven't heard the scared chicken scream in years..
Why do I loveeee her shirtttt
That looks so good!!!
You are the best YOUTUBER :D ßtŵ I am your number one fan •.• I am going crazy here lol
Girl use a hairdryer on the warm setting for a bit on the sticker and it will come right off it’s very satisfying
I always look forward to Moriah's Friday videos.
Awww. The video is over. :c
Moriah: i was in panick mode, trying to solve a problem and i-  Advert: discovered Audible   😳
Ok so the original petition for "Painting On Rubber Ducks" is at full capacity for replies, so, part 2?
Who else thought that Moriah should’ve painted the top a doughnut🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩
What paint do you use for the squishy‘s
Am I the only one who thinks that Moriah's intro sounds like OWWA OWWA lol
I wonder how long it made Mariah be a good artist
Who noticed that she is left handed
Umm i know this is a weird question but im trying to start a YouTube Chanel and was wondering what app or website do you use to edit videos???
gurl i luv u sweaterrrrr its so cuteee!
I just got a pickle plush ahhhhh!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🥺🥺🥺😯😯😯😯😻😻😻😻😻😻😻🤖🤖🤖😻😻😻😻
Love your videos Maria
tell me why when she said the ridges were hard to blend I went "then just remove them duhh"
Am i the only person who doesn't like gum?
You should paint ping pong balls with your characters faces and fill the bubble gum machine with them so it would look like bubblegum Then its more customizable and you can keep it without it going out of date
I watch her videos and try to recreate her pantings and yeah... i end up just feeling sorry for myself lol 👉👈😂
Can I get a Nigel plush 🥺
the ice s’more nut seems like a Lucielle
It’s true
Will you do another bake with me?
She makes all my fridays❤️❤️❤️
Maybe bigger gum balls work better
U should have made the scared chicken pop the bubble it would have been so cute
i wuv it
12:32 what
does anyone now hear “OWA OWA” in the intro? just me? kk.
You should of named the lazy sloth Bertram and if you know you know
Moreiah please send me a bag of bubblegum ❤
I'm sorry but ima call Nelson- Covid lol Only cause he reminds me of a germ
I don't know why but I want you to paint a whole room
not even a minute in and me and my bff are peeing are selves
I have been waiting SK EXCITEDLY!!
We need a Moriah Elizabeth out of context
Moriah: Especially the gum hole. Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SO HERE
ive been waiting for this video  :)
moriah should do a draw my life video ( like if u agree)
Love how she just burst her bubble in her hint video
v  chmgcghmfghfmgdmhnfhdgmncghfmhfgmfghmgmfhhgmf
Plsss name the bored sloth hank.... jUsT bEcAuSe
1:54 the pain!
Hi Moriah I watch your backing vids and their sooooooooo funny I just wanted to let you now love you
Who else has been waiting for Friday to come?
Moriah actually caring about the usage of the machine like she’s actually gonna use it
Can you do slime again please
.
"His name is..." Me: *Nelson* "Nelson." Me: *DFJGEJNDGBNDFJXNC*
Hi moriah you don’t know me but I’m going thru a sad state rn and when I see ur new video I smile
The face in the Gesso! 😂
I was really hoping you were gonna paint Benson
PLEASE PAINT ON RUBBER DUCKS
We totally need some Nilla and Rosie merch😍 those are sooo cute.
“Bubblegum machine” I’ve never heard someone call a gumball machine that 😭
can we take a moment to acknowledge her *true* talent?
Nobody:  Moriah: but then i noticed  aD: HaViNg ThIs DrInK WiLl HeLp YoUr ChILd'S DrAwInG sKiLs  Me: oop-  Also me: I wonder if haters say she needs that drink Nobody: Me: SHE DOES NOT MEED THAT SHE DRAWS THE BEST I HAVE EVEE SEEN BISH
I bet when you hit your arm it hurt, also you got it from good will that us unusual and yes that gum machine was very dirty but it was from good will you should have expected that. Your video was great by the way
am i the only one that thinks that moriah should try to do a diamond painting i rlly want moriah to try this hopefully she sees this!
Nice makeover😀
This might be a bad idea since she has so much gum, but maybe Moriah could get some bubblegum sized balls, paint them, and fill the machine with them? But that would be a lot of painting haha Maybe she could just paint a couple bigger balls and put them among the other gum balls in for decoration
Love it! 😁
The chow puppy is my favorite drawingggg >:3
what happened at 12:30? frames need analyzing?
ok my undertale friends who else saw the resemblense between nelson and alphys
“BE HONEST WHO'S BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME?” BTW I make vids!
Someone should really turn the glass bowl for the gum into a fish bowl and put like neon fish in there to look like gum balls
Oh no... She forgot her signature
No one: Moriah: “bOy YoU gOt A dIrTy GuM hOLe”
Fridays are always the best days because of Mariah
I just love how she basically talks and reacts to herself by using her own memes 💀💀  What a MOOD...
And can you subscribe to my YouTube channel
Lucy heartfilia from fairy tail
Moriah: CLEARLY this machine is whack.  Me: It’s meant for bigger bubblegum girl...
Who else noticed that the characters from the scared chicken are interacting with rainbow gum?
Can you paint my bubblegum machine?
when she put the first color down I'm like she's doing a RaInBoW!!
Hi who else loves here vids and thinks she is so talinted if u do like
YOU MUST MAKE A HORSE SQUISHIE
*New frames need Analyzing click ANALYZ*
I was early the I fell asleep watching this cause I didn’t go to sleep last night 😐😂 Issa joke chill
When you’re favourite youtubers post at the same time ._.
Looking at the thumbnail I was just like: haha! I knew it! I’m excited for this one. (I’m commenting this before I’m watching the vid)
OMG I love your videos and art 🎨
Is it just me or dose the part were the gum balls come out bother me cuz it’s not painted..
I think all the places that have those gumball machines should put cartoony characters on the glass because it just makes it seem more fun and entertaining to use!
Loved it again!!
Rubber DUCKKKSSSSSSSSSS
This should be a thing
I can’t believe I just found her channel last week! She’s by far the most underrated YouTube out there! So refreshing to see a successful YouTuber who isn’t obsessed with being famous
it looks awesome and you should of did pickle the dinosaur laying on a buble
Omg moriah I'm buying pickle kitty jacket I love you so much talk to you soon
Remember most of this video is a voice over.. Imagine in your head no noises in the video.. That's how it was..
Day 2 of asking for painting on rubber ducks.
Have you ever had to buy a new gesso?(idk if I spelt that right lol)
OMG! Maybe it was just me, but who else was laughing so hard when she got more bubblegum for free than when she paid for it? In tears, lol.
Also can you name the s’more donut ice cream cat Smorsie
you should do an episode testing gesso, to see if it is truly what it says it is
Love your vido
Love this vid
Of course like what you created I like everything you create
Pls do more squishy makeovers
I love your channel
lmao my brother won a gumball machine but we didn't know what to do with it because we didn't have any gumballs (our mother didn't let us because there's a child in the family)    we put little legos in it and got bored quickly
Omg it looks so cute good work!!!
Hi I love your paintings I like the squishy make overs your really talented
We are so close to 6mil pls everyone subscribed to moriah 💜
Ello my name is Jonathan an I will show you how to make yummy yummy bread    (I did that in a accent)
I love sloths to much
when you have that gumball machine in your house
I like how moriah uses her own memes and not the overused memes
"aha. shhhh.." I love it
I love how at the beginning she talks about how much space it has, then fills a good 75% of that space with rainbow. So Moriah. 😁 🌈
Moriah comes up with cute characters👍🏼👍🏼🦄🍭🍩😀
I have had so many little gumball machines! I find them at flea markets and garage sales. I love how you customized it! I etched the glass on one with etching cream and that turned out nicely.
Who says I can't meet new people in quarantine? I've met Nelson, Lucy, Bert, Rosie...
Hi Moria I a big fan I’ll be sending us art thing when I get the chance love ur vids!
Me: "Wow, the intro is not weird/strange!" Moriah: *starts fake kissing the machine* Me: "Never mind"
Moriah should fill this with mini squishies and use it for the random squishy makeovers
I'm literally wearing the same sweater today 🤣
Attendance for everyone who wants to see "pant a fishtank" or, "painting on a desk" <3 love you!
People who want her to paint on rubber ducks 👇
12:32 what’s that blue thing on the screen?
I'm glad you didn't use the regular characters, these one's are some of my FAVOURITES🤗❤️
Puppyyy
Every Friday I wake up and check if Moriah has posted I watch all her videos and literally never gets bored cause I love her she's so inspiring to me I want to be an artist that's why I watch her💗
Ohhh your sweater is amazing!!
Rosey should of been holding a pack of bubble gum
i love it
what video is the butterfly squishy in?
Elizabeth: cobwebs  Me: so a spider used to live in the gumball machine
Moriah: it’s the gesso that never ends  Me: *starts breathing heavily* thIs IS tHE sonG thAT nEveR eNds YEs it GOes oN ANd On mY FrienD
Moriah: omg my arms a sore  Me:yeah tell me about it! I stooped dancing 4 3weeks, then I danced for 4 hours straight. Then the next day i danced for 2. Then after that I had 3 hours of ballet
Do MORE cReAtE ThIS BoOoK PleAsE
Can I have a shout-out or somethin teehee love your vids and um or can you maybe comment or like this um comment do yeah thanks
I have the same gumball machine but smaller.😄
In the vid description it said another pisode instead of EPISODE lol
Moriah: I now have 5 1/2 bags of gumballs  Me: yeah I'll take that thank you
Day 2 of asking and waiting for a shout out BTW I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE YOU DID THE PRINCES IN TIARAS
Who else thinks Moriah brings us happiness!
Your green monsters name is            The same as my last name
Did anybody else just get satisfied when she scraped the sticker of with her nail!
Me remembers it’s Friday  My head oh crap I forgot (I almost never forget)
Watching the beginning...she’s gonna do rainbow
At first, I cringed HARD when you began painting on the gumball machine. Buuuuut, once it was done, I was in LOVE with it! Well done! 👍🥰🤩
Love it😍
OMG Morhia Like I have that same gumball machine that my parents have colectd and u made it look way better than mine like😳
Let’s all thank her for showing us how to break in to gumball machines
"I'm starting to get scared of that hole you NeVeR kNoW wHaTs In ThErE" Oh, so bubbleblackholes exist WOW I DID NOT KNOW THAT
Okay so if you see the Georgia plus in the background will you should know who Georgie is and our class came up with a ghost kind of invisible person called name Georgie so yeah and my friend tried to murder him
OMG I love this video!!!
Lmao this is ACTUALLY funny 😆
I guess I was wrong. It’s not a ballon. *sniff* I’m gonna go rethink my life.
This is probably one of my FAVORITES out of all of your videos. Although, I know for a fact that I e said this in multiple videos. Sooo.....idk but I LOVE this so much! And can you BELIEVE that there's NO bubblegum emoji yet? Get with it Emoji Creators 🤪
This made me so happy, my grandpa had one of these and he always let us get gum from it, it was very sentimental. My mom got me one for Christmas and I cried, miss that guy
I came back after 2019 omg
Why did i see the raibow paint pattern coming
I thought she was gonna paint on real gum lol but this is better though I really want to paint one
omg you’re so close to 6M!!
The black thing infront of the bubble gum machine kinda bothers me more than the red inside........it would probably look better if it was white......
Ya messed up 'episode' in your description xd
My entire art career: 8:10
My friend has this same one- like before the make over q-q
Moriah can solve any problems when it comes to messy art😌
Nelson is my dadd name what a coincidence
Doesn't anyone else want her to make a video of all of the times she's said "Hey it's me".....just me okay
Moriah: Then I noticed-- Ad: WANT A SUBWAY??
Love your videos I always look forward to them and I love the gum all machine! <3
I would actually love a series of Moriahs characters kinda like a kuwtk but her characters drama/ reality to show it would be so funny 😂
Hi
I actualy checked, and yes poscas can be used on Glass (side note) :3
I love how she saids you can see my reflection and zooms in
Me: don't paint on the glass don't paint on the glass because it will look bad Moriah: *paints beautiful design on the glass* Me: you never cease to amaze me
I have the same bubble gum machine 👍
Omg thank you so much for this videos I love you
Anyone else saw her post about dis?
May i have a bag of bubble gum i need to refil mine anyway. I found the machine on amazon https://www.amazon.com/Candery-Gumball-Machine-Dispenser-Twist-Off/dp/B08373WJYC/ref=sr_1_38?dchild=1&keywords=bubble+gum+machine+refill&qid=1611359952&sr=8-38

Moriah your art room could be a museum one day, every one of your creations are so beautiful and unique 👍
Wow, that's some bubble gum machine
Ngl I thought the constant background change was kinda cool!
OMG MY DAD HAS ONE OF THOSE FROM WHEN HE WAS A KID after every easter we buy the discounted jellybeans and gumballs and keep a small pan of change right next to it!!!       btw moriah luv ur vids <3
Moriah: " Gooey stickers should be illegal"  YASS SOMEBODY NEEDED TO SAY THAT  I absolutely despise it when stickers don't peel cleanly!!
Early [ 2 hrs late ]
I thought you where going to make the little people swimming in the gum balls that would be cute but I still love it

Wow the gumball machine has such a beautiful family
Moriah, just know that you are very talented and I love the way you draw!💕✨

She should paint mini squishes like candy or something and put them in there
Mariah: its simple  Ad: buy this brand of tampons and see feel the difference! Me: Mariah be making ads for tampons now? *realizes it’s ad* Me again: oh that makes so much more sense! Wait........ I’m stupid now!?

Mariah Elizabeth don't forget to do your seashell painting this summer you said it was now an annual thing
Me: trying to come up with a suggestion for the annoying red gum dispensing part... (will edit when I find a food-safe option)
I love how you made this ! It’s so cute 😍💜 Hmm maybe put a sticker or something to hide the red ? 🤷🏼‍♀️ ☺️
HOW IS THERE ALREADY 12K COMMETS IN 2 HOURS?!?!?!?

Day 1 of inspirational quotes: Don't just be *a* rock, be ✨t h e r o c k✨ 😍💅👍😘
Ahhhhh I love that! It’s so cute! >W<✨ I always love thrift store makeovers bc there always adorable! I wish I had half your talent 🥺
Who else think she should do a squishy makeover where she uses a color randomizer and she had to use that color to make a squishy. Example: if she got blue, she could use any shades of blue to decorate a squishy. Copy and paste for her to see
lol this vid was amazing. 😂 love you moriah!
Im commenting this cause one of my besties olive loves your channel so i thought it wpuld be cool to say hi to her through comments
' Today is another *pisode* '  Well I'm not sure what a "pisode" is but it sounds great, I'll have 3 more!
I actually have the gumball machine in the thumbnail lol
Who else wants to see her paint a Rubix cube with her characters on each side
Ok so I have an idea for your next series. So u would get a world glob and paint every state different. Also please give me a shout out. 🥺
Who else think she should do a squishy makeover where she uses a color randomizer and she had to use that color to make a squishy. Example: if she got blue, she could use any shades of blue to decorate a squishy. Copy and paste for her to see
4:16 to 4:23  That ‘Moriah meme’ was sooo *perfect* 😉
Who else thinks that once Moriah paints the rubber ducky’s, she should put them in the gumball machine  👇
Who else think she should do a squishy makeover where she uses a color randomizer and she had to use that color to make a squishy. Example: if she got blue, she could use any shades of blue to decorate a squishy. Copy and paste for her to see
I have that exact same bubble gum machine but I use it for jelly beans x
7:45 Hold up- rOSiE? I thought it was BuTTeRgoN🤨...?

Hi
Who else wishes they could binge Moriah's videos but can't because they have watched all of them😂
OH THAT'S FREAKING AMAZING!
I have been so excited for this! I love you're videos and you in general. You're hilariously and always make me smile. I hope you're doing well and have a great day!

O YESS
oh my God, I guess it would be this on Instagram
Why didn’t she paint the middle black part ???. I am crying with cringe 😬
No one: No one at all: Me screaming at Moriah for not putting eyelashes on Rosie
Friday is the best the best day of the week for so many reason's
I have to say, that cupcake video is the only video I refuse to watch again
Who else waits for Moriah to post a video like Christmas? Comment if you do and like I will like your answer to please
Hey Moriah, I have not watched your videos in a while because I keep requesting to do a house tour but you never listened but you are still my favorite YouTuber bye t I really want you to do a house tour please!❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🌈
Me when Moriah reveals the gumball machine: GASP YASSSS. (Will reply when i finish watching)
oh yeah yeah its not riiaannbbbooowww
lol your funny moriah
Hi
I think the bubblegum is to small that’s why ur getting more
I love this sweater
I love it 😻😻😻😻😻😻
But the fact that she just be like:          It’s just been marinating in my mind
I literally choked when she said “iTs The gESso ThAt NEvEr EnDs”
Who wants to see Her paint on rubber duckies The person who actually commented this was Katie
HELLO PEOPLE
“I’m just painting, I nice~ ‘Arangment’ of colors...(in no particular order)”
When she said “I’ll name her llllllllllllllucy” me like THATS MY NAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Iys the gesso that never ends yes it goes on and on my friend some people start at using it and yes knowing what it was and they continue using it forever just becausseeeeee.... ITs The geSSo THaT NevEr ENdS!!!!!
so goooooooooood
i hope that i'm not the only one who sings along to her intro it's so catchy!!!
Moriah 2021: it's a 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶 bubblegum machine 😆
It’s a gLoSsY tAcO
Pickle is offended that you didn’t draw him
i like nelson
Moriah! What you can do about the red on the inside- find some felt that matches your scheme, cut it to size, and glue it in. It will match the machine, it won't chip, and it's safe for the gumballs!
Love this video Moriah rocks 🤩🤩🤩
12:32  "New frames need analyzing; click Analyze.  Frames not analyzed for stabilization; click Analyze."   Anyone else or just me.....
It came out so cute!
I LITERALLY WAS GUESSING A NAME FOR LUCY AND WAS SAYING LUCY IN MY HEAD WHEN SHE WAS THINKING. WOW GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE
Why is Nelson my new favorite lol
Oooooo nice
People who lik ehow the backround changes   👇
Moriah, please paint key caps! I’m going to get baby yoda rein key caps for my WASD keys soon, and I’d love to see you paint some keys!
Moriah okay no more sound effects      ( sound affects playing right after she says no more sound affects ) 😂

wowo i cant believe she already has this many likes and comments and she only posted two hours ago!
*Attendance for everyone who wants to see "Painting On Rubber Ducks"*
I just wanna say. Thank you moriah. I've been going through alot and your video have helped me. I almost gave up drawing because I was bullied due to my drawings before the virus hit. But then one day I came across one of your videos and fell in love with your channel. So now I draw more often and now I even paint! So thank you even though you probably won't see this xD just wanted to say that. 💕💖
No one   Literally no one  Moriah: gum hole..... Not bum hole  Me:😂😂😂😂😂
I love moriah so much that I named my fishy after her :)
does anyone else get kinda scared when Moriah’s half painted face appears on the screen?!🤣
I LOVED THIS!
Yup I obviously thought it was going to be a fun machine and not a gum.😳
7:29 how about bob
U should do some art with the leftover bubblegum
i really want to see her do a challenge where she paints completely against her style
You should make that some of your Merchandise!
PLS do a bake with me video! U haven’t done on in a while!!!! Ps. LOVE your videos!!
It came out so good definitely screams Moriah Elizabeth!🙌🤩cant wait till you hit 6mil🙌
How bubble gum was created: There once was a man who worked in a gum factory not bubble gum just regular gum and one day he was very bored so he decided to experiment with a a few ingredients and the colour he used was rose    And after he mixed everything he realized it was similar to gum but it made bubbles thats how it was created. Pink is a bubble gum color bc when it was first created color used was rose and rose is  pretty much pink.
My sister has the same bubblegum machine It's currently in my room because I like to inhale gumballs-
U need to make a plush of the butterfly dinosaur  (Ps I would totally buy the bubblegum Machine)
SHE SHOULD CUSTOMIZE A POPCORN MACHINE!❤️✨
The cat is named Lucy   *Sweeney Todd has entered the chat*
Partition to see moriah paint rubber ducks! 👇🏻
SHE NEVER MAKES CREATE THIS BOOK SERIES!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Talks to much
I love it! It's so cute and unique and I wish I could be as good of an artist as you are☺👍
0:24 OMG MY GOD GURL CLAM DOWN
Omg I watched the tiktok thing and I see it now gum gumball machine
I love your videos and channel and my favourite squishy is durp the durpy dinosaur 🦕
XDDDD
THIS WAS SO AMAZING AAA
now I feel the need of buying a bubble gum machine hahah
Moriah: * paints stripes of colour * Me: * dying inside * Moriah: * blends them * Me: OH THANK GOODNESS
Very nice!
When I was watching it I was thinking that you could also make the top clear part into a single character and make their mouth open- where you see the gum...
Beautiful
I like rainbow color 🌈🍭
Who wants her to put Pom poms in it
hi how are you
I have poskas
Is it just me or now that she named the sloth I want his merch. Bert the Bored sloth
i- i- i- GET TF OFF MY RECOMENDED pls thx you
I loved this vid! pls do more thrift store make overs! and can you also do more create this book 2?
So cute!! Love your style.
I’m freaked out! I have the exact same bubblegum machine!!
Those who have post notifications already knew she was doing this 😉
Moriah: Walks into the thrift store  Employees: no... not her again....
THE SNOW CONE WILL NEVER DIE
Maybe for the red part you didn’t paint, you could paint over the plastic cover so it hides the red? Idk I loved the makeover tho!! 😆💜
The cat and my gf have the same name Lucy ❤️
Love it❤❤❤
What an amazing creation! For some reason, hearing you say "Dispense bubblegum" with the Sloth onscreen was really funny
i have that gumball machine 🏃‍♀️
“I’m gonna paint the top to match the bottom in rainbow I mean randomly colourful gradient” 😂😂😂
why is nobody talking abt how at 12:33 it says editing stuff?
I’m so happy that you uploaded it feels like I’ve been waiting for this video for TWO WEELS
lol
ive been watching u for how long now and JUST realized that ur a lefty?? I loved the vid btw, thrift makeovers are rlly cool
my teacher has that art teacher big one and small one
Moriah: His name is Nelson! Me: That's my Math teachers first name!!! And he wears glasses too!!!!! 😱😱😱
So cute
Omg, that sweater is GORGEOUS!!!!
I think you should use chalk marker on glass and it would be easier! I remember you have some of them from your things to do when bored vid
NELSON MERCH   O.....M.....G
I think she should do a cotton candy machine next
My Grampas name is Burt
Or can you make a Burger out of to panda buns as the patty buns plllllsssss
You  Know you should really paint your door trust me it fun i have done it .
was i'm the only one who was waiting to see georgie in the begining lol
i laughed so hard when i saw ur face in the gesso
What I would do for something she has made!
I NEW IT FROM THE THING yayyyyyyyt
She didn't add sprinkles to it... 😨😨😰😰😭😭😭😭
I’m surprised she didn’t put her squishy’s in there instead of bubble gum
when Moriah said she didn't do pickle I nearly threw up
The people who disliked the video is just jealous that they don't have her amazing talent
Which Goodwill
On Friday’s, I have a daily ritual to watch moriah.
This is how many times she said bubble gum 👇
Why does moriah put herself down she is amazing and she has inspired me to start doing art and I'm getting better every day. She is so cool and even my mom loves watching her and she laughs every video and hey I'm early. Thank you moriah for inspireing me to do art. She also does not bored me when she does rainbow actully I want her to do one rainbow at least in every video.
You should paint masks
12:34  Did you guys catch the editing mistake?
Hey moriah and other people would you rather live without rainbow or sprinkles?
I went to good will A couple days ago and saw a gum ball machine then my mom said I couldn’t get it. Then when I was just about to get in the car again I saw somebody grab the gumball machine.
Two comes out because there smaller than the ones at the shop
I’ve been watching u since your first squishy make over I think
“It’s kind of....UNIQUE”- Moriah Elizabeth 2021
Oh my god if you ever get rid of all the bubble gum you should put your charms in there!
Hi  I have an video idea Make tik tok painting hacks 🎨 I ❤️U
1:29 * Levi likes that*
Hay can you paint a panda bun squishy and make it look like an actual panda
Hey
I love this and bubblegum!
I have a game sponsored by u
You could paint the little hatch that opens up to give you the bubblegum so it looks nicer and you not see the red all the time
Why didn’t you put the glass on a pillow... that way given you sustainability? 😏😏😏
Please do painting on rubber ducks!
It concerns me your arms are sore Moriah XD
I love this! But if you really hate that red you could paint on the outside of the glass idk how well it would work but just a suggestion!❤️
and your tellling me that you did not add georgie...
I want to buy this please add to mercy like so moriah sees please
You are my idol Moriah. I watched every single one of your vids and they are absolutely amazing. I love how you put so much effort in your videos and I love you very much. I try to do these like you, but of course they turn out very bad. Can you please do something special on my birth day? It’s in 3 months. April 8th, 2011.
Moriah is soooo talented
PIANT ON DA RUBBER DUCKS
*me casually watching the video and then...*  10:20  Me: VaNeLlOpEeEeE  IS THAT CHYOU!
I❤you
Not to be a smart Alec but... you have 4.5 bags left if you used 2.5 and you had seven. Sorry lol love you moriah
I have this idea, what if Moriah makes Gorgie a girlfriend her name can be umm many Georgia. Good idea or not?
I love it when she does these videos!
Me: dead skin cells!! 😮  Moriah: YAY
You should name that dinosaur pin Nerdy Nelson and if you don't like the red from the "gumball hole" just paint the clear window and it will block the red
I love yo
i have the EXACT same bubble gum machine-
Yay I love thrift store makeover
i hope you never stop editing the way that you do. today i was having a really bad day and i looked at my phone and saw that you came out with a new video and it really just made me laugh. i love you
Never doubted myself about thinking that.
I have a gumball machine
My NaMe Is LuCy!!!!!!! I’m sooooo exited 😆
😍
i can't believe she didn't buy pastel colored bubble gum
Am I the only one that just realized that Moriah was left handed 😭!? There’s nothing wrong with that but I’ve been here for years and this is the first time I noticed it 🥲
Me before the vid: rainbow? Me: I knew it.
wait i have one of these i bought it fo 2 dolla
WHO IS ROSIE!? DID I MISS AN EPISODE!?!?!?
me: :( moriah: new painting video me: :)
Honestly, I would have taken the whole thing apart and thrown it in the dishwasher
this is my fav series ever
In the next vid paint on rubber ducks BUT THEN, PUT THEM IN THE BUBLE GUM MACHINE!😶🤫😏😏😏
Me: Oh gosh I hope she doesn't paint on the glass Moriah: I'm going to to the action on the glass! O^O Me: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  I ended up liking it. You go Moriah! ;)
Moriah: look at that space   Me:waaaaa she gonna use the space to fill something
no one ever noticed moriahs reflections until she says somethingg 😂
No one No body Not even Einstein High school teachers : Actually its 4 and 1/2 bags of bubble gum left.
I have headaches a lot but your beautiful art heals them
Yay i guessed it correctly !  Love your vids!!
Painting onrubber ducks Would be amazing I love you Moriah Elizabeth
I like how Moriah uses her own memes 😂
She did her math wrong lol. She said she had 7 bags and she used 2 1/2 so she has 5 1/2 left but she really has 4 1/2
I I not late ya I love all your vids
You have been my favorite YouTubeer for 4 years!! I watch your videos every Friday
I LOVE IT
I love the bubblegum machine and it made me laugh me laugh😜
She never bakes anymore 💔
HEY!! 👏👏 OVER HERE!      so i have a second idea about the bubble gum that i just wanted to like mention i guess       DRUMROLL PLEASEEEEEE *ratattatattatattaattata*             AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING LOOKED LIKE A PENGUIN?!!?!         lol sorry i’m an idiot
I love the way it turned out!!
Can u do a vid when u paint on the rubber ducks
With all that bubble gum how will have time to kick ass
We neeeeed a customized Rubik’s cube
Her:starts drawing her characters Me: gets georgie plush excitedly Her: doesn't use georgie Me: sadly puts georgie plush down and begins crying
Copy and Paste this: Paint on Rubber Ducks!
Love you
If you want to ‘draint’ on glass get chalk pens, like so moriah can see
I LOVE YOU MORIAH, love your ‘memes’  😱
Why do I feel like this is the first time she wore a shirt from a different video-
I forgot it was friday
I have the same thing :)
Early squad only 2 hours ago!
Moriah aggressively slapping her paint brush on the surface of the gum ball machine while blending is a mood
I was late cus I was on a hike. Like if moriah elizabeth is your favorite Youtuber!!!
I love when my fave youtubers post! It makes my day!
Her: doesn't use georgie Me: cries in pineapple duck
Love how the first video I saw of her was when she painted herself like her cupcake squishy and I’ve been addicted ever since! Love you!!!!!!❤️🧁
Oh my gosh that is so cute! What an AMAZING idea I am definitely gonna have to try that out.
Me: catches her calling it his Me: she will make it a character with a hat Five minutes later: nope it is even more adorable then I could have Imagined
And love them every time
it is rilly nice i like it
I watch your videos every week
13:13 her nails and the bubble gum matched. Lolol.
I would’ve painted most of the glass with but left a little then painted a bucket dropping the gum balls that are in there. If I where to add more I would add a label  saying -not sorted into rain bow - or something like that. And if I wanted to add your characters I would get some of the running to try catch and the sloth sitting and watching and watching them and one character trying to drag him to come help
Agreed
OMG MY NAME IS LUCY THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER
I like your shirt and your nails
Bro she spent over 100 dollars on bubble gum
Moriah : "burt" My brain : henry stickmin
Oh my gosh this is literally one of my favorite designs that she’s made it’s so cute and I love the idea like if she should do more bubblegum ones
Frames not analyzed 😡
Nelson is my new favourite character (jk Georgie is still the best but Nelson is also great)
No one: Mariah playing inspirational music at a very random time when she was stuttering?  Me confusing myself with the comment I’m writing 😂
Can you do a vlog I’m getting a little board of the art videos (also I understand these videos are not just for me and EVERYONE has different opinions, this could possibly come off as very rude but what i mean is that I would like to see some different content if possible whatever she is comfortable with and I definitely don’t mean that she should stop doing the videos she likes)
I love this video, will you put this in your Merch please!!!also I love you and your videos they got me though some rough moments of mine
Ya know the only thing that could make this better in my opinion is to paint the silver part white so it fits together (also there is food safe paint :D)
U should do a makeover on a doll idk why but maybe that would be fun
New Frames Need Analyzing. Premiere Pro was freaking out👀
I  love it!!! And I really really love that you used Rosie!! She's my absolute favorite!!! I also love that you used a lot of your lesser-known characters, though, and named them!  The more the merrier! Also, lots of exclamation points!!!!
YESSSS SHE POSTED
The red bothers me to ohh you can paint only  the glass part so all you see is the paint not the red where the bubble gum comes out of
No one: Literally no one: Moriah: It just looks like every other bubble gum Machine that you have ever seen Me: Where’s the bubble gum
“It just looked like a screeching sound”  FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU CAN SEE SOUNDS!
HER SWEATER!
Still waiting for the ducks
hasjgfjhahjfhjasvjhvjhasvjh I LOVE YOUR SHIRT
You did such a good job!! I love it!!
Anyone else see the frame thing when she put the bubblegum in??
i really needed this, my cousin and me had been watching for almost 4 years and unfortunately today he passed away. these videos made him feel better and helped him through the painful days. It feels strange to be watching without him, may he rest in peace ❤️
"There are so many reasons why people love to play candy crush, if you haven't played it yet download the game."

Now you gotta find where to put it! In that shelf of yours. Lol
Moriah: dead skin cells  Me: eeeewwwww
Why did I never realize she was left handed 😱
Hi I love your videos ^_^
nobody:  nobody at all:     moriah: but...i did get an abundance of dead skin cells for FREE
RUBBER DUCK RUBBER DUCK RUBBER DUCKKK
Just an idea.. moriah in another video you said you wanted to do something with your mini squishy‘s u can shrink the ones u have and put those in the bubble gum Machine!! Love you :)
This is one of the most spectacular art projects ever I love it
Nooooo is that an antique?! 😱
I'm annoyed with how many dislikes there are on this video :/
DID ANYONE ELSE REALIZE THAT IN HER DESCRIPTION IT SAYS "pisode" INSTEAD OF E-pisode GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.   lol on a serious note loved the video I thought it was a really cool Idea. UwU
So there's this really fun game called'Throw Throw Burrito'In the game you get two burrito squishies you're supposed to use in the game. I think it would be a really good idea if you bought and customized this game into your own 😆 I love you Moriah ur my favourite You Tuber 💕
( ꈍᴗꈍ) this is ✨class✨
It's been 40 seconds and she's already making me laugh <3
YOU NEED TO PAINT ON RUBBER DUCKS

I love how its she also pleas do the painting on rubber ducks ida
Moriah - My arm hurts  Table - Are you sure about that-   Few minutes later   Moriah hits her arm on the table-  Table - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Ok this is random but I need to see Moriah’s skin routine 🥺🥺
Soo cute
Hi

Fun fact: Everyone wants to raid Moriah’s house
The glass painting is awesome!
That’s gonna look great in your art room!
Where da frog prince?
This was really fun to watch <3 Would be cool to see more of that green little monster in the future, he is cute....but less bubblegum farts thanks xD
I love your thrift store series so much, it’s radically different every episode!
I had that exact bubblegum machine, lol
I was hoping she would paint it like a fish tank
Why is that so cute tho 🤧
Her:free dead skin cells Me: nah nah nah you got those for 99 cents
Pumpy is way underrated
i love this it looks so cute, looks like it would be in a arcade or toy store!
In other words: Me wants to trace
I really feel like there aren’t enough people talking about how INSANELY COOL this is??!! Outstanding work as usual Moriah, this is super awesome!
How do you solve a problem like Moriah? Stick a tonne of glossy varnish on it! *sing in Sound of Music*
Super cute love this idea can you paint a whole deck of cards as a series x
:D
I’m an idiot.    When you posted your hint for this video I need a guest painting on gum wrappers    Like why
THE GREEN MONSTER HAS MY LAST NAME OH MY LORD!!!

Nelson was always such a Nelson
Loveee it 💗💗
Are we not going to talk about how CHuNKy  the bored sloth, a.k.a. "Bert" is
If you are ever feeling down just remember that you are loved and Arthur Weasley would love for knowing how to use a toaster ❤️

It's weird to know that she's a Mrs.
I’m late sorry Moriah I had STUPID SCHOOL

I was the 55K person to leave a like!!!
It’s so cute!!
IM AFAN!!!! Me and my Bff thought u r gonna do a squishy makeover!
Hi
I’m a big van
I did not see her reflection in the glass until she pointed it out
MORIAH SHOULD DO DIAMOND PAINTING! COPY AND PASTE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  (Mofilafal is the writer of the original comment)
Gum Hole.
I relate so much with the sloth
Moriah: *Makes sound effects*   Jordan: ...... Honestly, whats going on in those videos??
Hi
aw i lovee the bubble gum machine - dispenser - thing....😐😐    ....    ITS ADORABLE!! 😁
Trypophobia 5:16
I love this sooo much wow
Omg I love Lucy! My name is Lucy too!! I feel our personalities relate :)
I thought at first she was going to put the characters in space suits, so they're like, floating through space! Why I thought this, idk.
Now this is what I call PARKOUR PARKOUR.
When you think its small but then you see its big YOU CAN NEVER UNSEE IT
Boi I went thrift shopping a couple years ago and I’ve got the exact same bubble gum ball machine.
Other people: hey more rainbow   Me: nooooooo I wanted to be gorgie mmmmmmm
It’s the gesso that never ends 🎶
this is so cool 🥰
I love this vid also I commented on your yt story like if you guessed it was a bubble gum machine 👍🏼can’t wait for the next vid
Cuteeeeee
What about painting on rubber FROGS
Why would someone not like it is good
This is hands down my absolute favorite video of yours! WOW
1:35 WHAT IN THE SWEET MOTHER OF HELL IS THAT
"But then I noticed...." (target add pops up)
I chewed gum while watching this lol
Oml u should make a bubble gum squishy to put in it
Hiiiiiiii
Omg no way
YESSS MORIAH LOVE U 😍
How do you edit like that
am i the only one who just noticed in this vid that moriahs a lefty
Hikekkeke
The day that she ever dies our lives will never be the same
Petition for Moriah to paint the ducks and then put them in the gum ball machine
lol Waiter: would u like an order of mozzarella sticks? Moriah: It's been marinating my mind
for the red thing where the gum comes out, you could've painted the cover so you couldn't see the red. just a suggestion
"That just looks like a screeching sound" Moriah Elizabeth 2021
Okay, I definitely need that pastel rainbow sweater she is wearing in the beginning, it is ADORABLE!
The glass is literally my favorite part
U make me happy every time u make video <33 ily ❤️🧚‍♀️
If you don't have an idea to do maybe u can paint some furniture in your art place what ever u call it (I am very dumb) but it's ok if no bc it was expensive
There is a huge glare in the bubble gum machine
I just got that gumball machine for my birthday!!!! So Cool!!
Her sweater is so pretty! Moriah if you see this, where did you get it?
Hi
Put this in front of your house and see how much money you can make when really they can get it for free...😏
I thought moriah was 22
Can we just appreciate her jumper! I love those pastels!
To solve the “seeing red in the little compartment area” problem, you could have just painted the outside of that little door thing white or black, instead of keeping it transparent.
The cat's name is MEGAN! IT NEEDS FO BE MEGAN, I don't care if it DOESN'T match it NEEDS to be MEGAN!
Love the fact how she uses her own videos as memes😌😭
Moriah hasnt done a baking video in soooooo long pls do one
Omg I love this!!!❤  More thrift store makeovers please!!!!
That's so cool how you paint it
Nah Morriah is funny nah im bot rjcuchudhfuffbchfj I love bubblegum!  fhucdhchd
WAIT- MORIAH IS LEFT HANDED-
Its a 3 for free deal ;)
I’m late for the first time in months      😔✋🏽
I feel sinful watching this video while wearing my rainbow striped shirt without the purple stripe
#lovedyournewvids
ALL HAIL O’MIGHTY NELSON
Me: What???   Normal People: I knew it.   Me: I thought she was painting with gum though.
Moriah: that LOOKS like a screeching SOUND
I really looked forward to this, thank you for making my shitty week a bit better ❤️ you’re amazing and inspire my art every day ✨
Hey im earlyyyy
Rosie reminds me of dragonite
Am I the only one that thinks Nelson the monster honestly looks like Nelson from Austin and ally 😂?
rainbows are valid no matter how much you do them
Plz decorate big marbles with character designs or anything and put them in there like gumballs. That would be cool
“That just *looked* like a screeching sound        Making real sense there Moriah
Finally
White bubble gum would’ve really made the characters POP!! Love this!
That is NOT mini
at 12:15 i thought she was singing it’s the most wonderful time of the year but with different lyrics 😂
Hi
Havent watched the whole video yet but, Moriah why don't you just put two colors of paint on your brush and blend from side to side. Thats how I do gradient. I feel like it will make your future proje ts easier
I painted a rainbow space
Were can i buy a gumball machine and baint on it?
Moriah should paint on a mask
When Moriah posted her video 1 hour ago. YEEEEEEEEEESSSS
Ypu should try blending with a sponge brush
Moriah: bubblegum machine   Me: Isn't it called a Gumball Machine.     ;-;
I love it!! ❤️
The green guys farting the bubble gum out
I’m exited to have this in the background with a bunch of bubble gum in it. It’s so cute!
12:33 the heck is that blue line lol
I have the same machine lol
I got some merch for Christmas
This is how many people guessed bubble gum machine  👇
Me: The Never ending story uh uh The never ending Gesso
Make creat this book #3! I think it's time
“It’s a random pattern”  “It’s a rainbow-it’s a random pattern”  “It’s a rainbow pattern”  The cycle of denial
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii love your shirt today 😌
YAY i havent seen you post in a while.
Sooo cute
PAINT THEM RUBBER DUCKS PLEASE
She is one 9f the best artists I've ever seen
That looks freaking amazing. Thrift store makeovers are my favorite. This was awesome!!
this its what you should name it: "the bubble gum machine that gives you more for free"
Does anyone else fall asleep when you watch her vids       No just me.....ok cya😴
Moriah Elizabeth i think you should paint the rubber ducks you got in the last vidio like if you agree btw if you see this i love you xxx
pOtTaH
I thought she would've drawn the chicken laying the bubble gum cuz ya know.... It's a chicken.
I was chewing gum while watching this.🤣
You should paint on a soccer ball!!   Like is you agree👍🏻
Moriah : Goey Price sticker should be banned ~ NoBodY liKE s U Who agrees (I feel bad for the goey price sticker) But they are annoying
So happy to see “new” characters being drawn again : ).  I did miss Nelson lol.
Why haven't you got 10 million subscribes yetttttttttt????????!!!!
Hey
cool
Omg, It turned out so good. I really like how you did the new design. The new design is giving me 80s and 90s vibes. I got my pickle hoodie like a couple of months ago and i love the hoodie
Well ummmm I hope you like bubble gum
Imagine getting pinned...
do the watermelon out of the hopeless been
don’t be shy. Click analyze
Can you customize a backpack in a next video
kinda early
You should Make pickle a girlfriend
When I saw this I was like  OmG mOraIh UpLoAdEd
This is so adorable!! Now I want to make one myself!  Also, is anyone else bothered by the red area that wasnt painted, where the gum comes out of, or is it just me? 🤣
I have a good idea for a gumball machine. You could paint the glass to look like an aquarium with fish and the stand could be sand
okay we all love moriahs art videos but i’d love to see a day in life vlog
hi its MEEEEEEEEOW
OODWI
she should have painted the grey part gold
Here for the rubber ducks!
People  that arew disliking are jellyyyy
I have that same thing
I love this so cute!!! 💕
Every single time she says bubble gum machine instead of gumball I want to rip my hair out and scream. Love u Mariah 💓😄
Me who’s never seen a bubble gum machine before because I’m an idiot😌
It looked nice before, but after IS PEERFECT!!!!
I think Nelson  Luke’s like one of those kids who loves school  and studying
This is one of my favorites!!! So cute!!
You always cheer me up thx today I was really sad because me and my brother was fighting and he slapped me and I told my mom but she got mad at me cause I’m the older sister and I should be more responsible so thx for cheering me up
I’m gonna guess before watching this that it’s gonna be rainbow
Defenetly worth my time right?
Can you make a unicorn next please.
I *want* it. I want it *now.*
Oh how I was wrong 😂
Save all the spare gum for Halloween! It will be gone in no time
Responding to Katie the comment before me she did that
Hi there! :D
I love you this is my dads account
Let’s make her mad heheh  ❤️💚💙💛🧡💜
That is very cute!
hello
I thought it was making a picture out of gumballs
😮So cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
The muddled otter recently judge because shallot unpredictably wobble per a coherent approval. mixed, ubiquitous football
30% of the air you breathe is dead human skin cells. Have fun breathing
Are you still going to do squishy makeover
EARLY... (kinda)
once u said Bert as the name of the sloth i went straight to the character from big bang theory haha
I love your channel you really help me crate better art😁❤️🧡💛💚💙
Imagine....your casually painting one day, nothings out of the ordinary until then you grab the gesso AND SEE MORIAH'S FACE
Put your pompoms in it
Tbh I would never notice the background changes if she didn't say anything 😅
She’s having a meet and greet! 1 ticket cost 1 like, are u invited?
I kinda want her to try calligraphy but that might be me
and i just ordered a pickle!!!!
If your 2 hours late.... Don't pretend you were first. There's to many comments with everyone thinking they are first. Only one person could be first. 😒
Hi
Paint a paint container
LOVE how you showed your other characters some attention! Please keep doing this❤️ Great video!
Moriah: But I know better than to give up after the first coat Billie Eilish: I know better than to drive you home
Love it!
In Australia it’s soooo hot
OMG I GUESSED IT RIGHT YAY!!!
Do you think you have a person to watch because it Was posted two minutes ago but is your day more than 1,000,016 that have seen it and about 500 comments
Me: looking through YouTube waiting for Moriah to post a video
you could put your money in there for bubblegum and by the end of the year you might make a bit of cash? even if its a penny.....
This was SO CUTE!!! UwU
I got a bear rolling up toilet paper for an ad
Im eating gum during this video and i just noticed omg
Moriah you should do another video with Sam!!!! i miss seeing him in videos!!
Haha😂🤣😅
Olso dat hey gais jos meks my hort to go yaaaaaaaas friday tads woy my favred day es Fridas
Fun fact: if you put "fun fact" people will read the whole thing😂
even tho I read a bunch of comments talking about the reflection I s t i l l didn't see it
Guys Moriah's channel is so close to 6 million subs let's try to get to 6m by next Friday 🎨🖌️
Your intro music now reminds me of Pudgy and I’d like to thank you for that. OWA OWA
oh well hi-
Paint on ducks!?!! (Rubber)
Moriah: says she won’t put sound effects Her after 0.005 seconds: puts sound effect
Also I’m going to be drawing you something and you’re not the only one that criticize their artworks I think my artwork is trash
Can you please do the squishy makeover the next time you do a video🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I love everything you make it makes my day
Does anyone else want Rosie the bashful dragon merch???? 😎😎😎COS I WANT IT SO FREAKING MUCH ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I would’ve straight up washed this because that looked so gross🤢
Great video! Who else thinks Moriah should paint small balls and put them in the bubble gum machine! The balls could have like each of her characters!  Like if u want to see that
You sod pant a fih boll 🐠
Me : Moriah I wonder how you haven’t ran out of paint not just gesso
This is just adorable! If you don't like the red part, maybe you can paint over the transparent plastic cover instead of painting the place where the bubblegum falls?
I think you could of put ribbon on the inside in the rainbow order
I love the little charcters on the glass and all of the hard work that went into the wonderful despencer. It looks great and great job of doing different charcters this time.
I really like how the characters look on the glass  'twas a great idea
Omg!?! You did awesome!😍
maam do something else besides rainbow for once
WHEN ARE YOU EVER GOING TO CHEW THAT MUCH BUBBLE GUM
I love how it turned out amazing job

Imagine this being your first video of Moriah 😂😂
I got a gumball machine in ACNH yesterday....
"I did get an abundance of skin cells... FREE!" Implying that skin cells cost money
You should but like really small squishes in the gum-ball machine so someone can get a surprise squishy or pin but no swallowing the pin please just a idea that my adhd had to mention
Super cool
I am always waiting for another video.. I love your vids!!!
Only 2 hours late but I live in the uk and rn it’s midnight
*I don't know what's going on in there. I think I'm being a fish? I don't think I need to apologize for my behavior, at this point, I think we're all used to it.*
The day Moriah runs out of gesso is the day the world has collapsed
I love your videos
Anyone here who is just *IN LOVE* with Moriah’s sweater???
"But then I noticed-" "Dawn powerwash dish soap!"
I wish you spray painted the base and top instead of acrylic

Sorry if this is a weird question but when Moriah says “Me” does she mean Moriah Elizebeth or me like her?

Who else has friends that get bothered when u talk about moriah and how awesome she is
We need a lazy sloth stuffed animal pls moriah notice this we NEED A LAZY SLOTH
I always watch Moriah in 2x speed so in my head she talks really fast and whenever I hear her normal voice I do a double take
I just realized that my birthday is on yours, my birthday is November 14th and your birthday is on November 14th Me on the inside: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YYYYYAAAAAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!
She is honestly so good at painting🎨🤩
Moriah: paints a rainbow  Also Moriah: thinks we are getting sick of the rainbow Me sitting in my bed getting excited everytime she paints a rainbow: 👁👄👁
You should do a vid where you paint on a large piece of furniture
That’s super cute add a piece of pink felt where the red is that would be cute
I think she should do that painting cards for a card set like if you agree coment your idea of how she should do it
pls paint rubber ducks!!!
Moriah should make a video where she puts pieces of paper with drawing ideas in the gum ball machine and draws what she gets!
Moriah: sticky price stikers should be ilegal The sticker: am i a joke to you!?!?!? Me: 🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂

Attendance for everyone who wants to see “Painting On Rubber Ducks
I got the answer wrong
I love how she points stuff out and sometimes I don’t even notice until she points it out
does it not bother you that she made the dogs bubble orange love u girl but ITS SUPPOSED TO BE PINK
<3
I love the final results
Loved the design of it 😊 Really cute!
I am never eating gum from a gum ball Machine again🤢  That’s disgusting
Moriah: It was kind of awkward trying to draw on a round bowl while filming and trying to stay in frame. Me: Ya dont say...
My mama: Yo MaMa
I just got home from school and I am already watching your video
I think you shouldn't paint the glass and focused more on the body I think it would be more cute
Nobody: Moriah: let’s use MEmes from my creepiest video that’ll be perfect 👌
Moriah u should paint A table
Now you have... bubblegum for life! Great lol
I love your videos so much
im earlyy
This is how many people love moriah elizabeth   👇
This is a great "pisode", Moriah. I normally hate gum and gum themed things, but this came out looking very cute.
It's Nelson the Nervous Nerd 😂
Can you do ducks? I think it would make a really good video!
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen!!
1 hour ago: 11938 comments,...
😆i loved this video!
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooooooo
Noooooo !!!! I acudntly skipped the video and saw the finish look 😢😭
MY MOM HAS THAT EXACT SAME ONE
watched an ad for ya
I was right!! I said it was going to be this😁
◾️ ◼️ ⬛️
I have been so excited to see you make this over. Better than anticipated. I love seeing the underused characters spotlit, too.
Am I the only one who remembers the whole chicken family (we can't forget Mrs duck ) lol
I love your videos
Grul I love your sweater
Nobody like literally NOBODY:  Moriah: “It’s been marinating in my mind.”
Moriah: then I noticed-   Ad: "I was totally STRANDED"
i have “its the gesso that never ends” stuck in my head now 👁👄👁
'Me wants to trace' can that please be a meme
I am sad I don't have scwishis
U should put mini shuishies in the gum ball machine
Me:  looking at comments  Moriah: ending her really long speech about painting Also me: what did she say
Elizabeth: Oh im 26, whats your point. Me: The 26 year old version of Jojo Siwa. Our world couldnt get Worst
For glass it's bets to use acrylic paint or oil based pens
I love your sweater 😍
Looks cute! You would have had an easier time if you cute down the sketches to the general shape of the characters before taping them in...they would have moulded to the round shape better. :)
you should make that your merch!
Who else wants another bake with me?

I got moriahs ad for candy crush right before the video and was momentarily confused
Rainbow, who would have guessed...      At least it is really cute ❤️       😂

Should’ve colored the hole that released all the gum

Mini-?
Who else thinks that Moriah Elizabeth should paint on a Rubik cube? Copy and paste
Hey Moriah! You should customize those little rubber duckies.
It’s really cool, but I think you forgot the Sprinkles😂💙
Nelson looks like Arthur ngl

I think I like the swapping backgrounds.

This vid needs more likes
thank you for introducing me to graveyard loon I love his content and love to see how channel has grown in the past week
I remember donating that but can't remember when
Moriah: “Owwww!”  Me every day 😑
I just realised that Moriah is almost at 6M subscribers.
Heyyy Moriah!!! You should do painting on rubber ducks!!! And also I like that the backgrounds changed. 💖 it looks cool like that
oml kinda early!? 1 hour ago!
It would have been cool if you painted the part where you put in the coin like a metallic silver or gold
Who else loves how she uses her self as memes for her vids😂
Great video Moriah i love you!
I HAVE THAT! I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS!! Btw I loved the video 😉
I can’t believe that Moriah... Moved almost 2 years ago Cut her hair 1 1/2 years ago Started squishy makeovers 2 1/2 years ago Has been a huge impact on my life for almost 7 years
She should do a challenge where she does draw any rainbow 🌈 and see how it comes out lol 😂 luv u

OMG HIIIII IM A NEW FANNN:D
Do a gumball givaway??? I'll take some ^-^'

I love your vieds so much
where did you get that sweater???
13:14 any body notice how the bubblegum matches her nails?
Moriah you could put con-tact paper inside the dispenser region
Moriah: walks into thrift store Employees: “How can I help you?” Moriah: “Yes”
yes i was right i guessed it correctly!
12:31 New frames need analyzing; click Analyze.
People: use regular memes  Moriah: uses herself as a meme
She super good at drawing and painting and morah what kinda on markers u use??
Hello I’m kinda early
Cute how about you name the little green dude Simon
It turned out so good! Its definitely my favorite thrift store makeover that you have done so far!
I KNEW IT
Is Rosie
Moriah is so funny so I laugh every Friday.
You should get little balls to put in the gumball machine and paint them!
The makeover was awesome as always! But is no one gonna mention her adorable sweater?! It's so pretty! I'm curious sometimes where she shops to find rainbow clothes or mismatched sleeves! I can't imagine she makes all of them, there most be a factory or more than intentionally makes clothes like that.
Is it just me that here’s the owa owa dog in the intro ??🤭😂
Does moriah respond? Or reply
DO MORE RAINBOWS NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Roses are red Violets are blue I liked my own comment Bc no one else will 👁️💧👄💧👁️
My name isrosie
Oh, it’s beautiful!  The red in the gum drop area seems like a retro nod to me...love it!
*me after seeing the hint now seeing the video*         CALLED IT.
Hi
Instead of painting on the inside use some colorful washi tape!!
Me and my friend are making a Minecraft world that’s how much we love your videos!
The sloth squishy should be called Arthur
When u said u where going to paint something like gum on your story page idk I thought u were actually gonna paint on gum (I am so stupid)
Ok but am I like the only one who didn't even realize that the background changed?
The candy machine was so cute and small! I love wahts she makes!
HI
Moriah: taking apart everything and putting it back together Me: wait what- such engineer O-O✨
Super cute!! Love it! Fridays are def my favorite day cuz it's ME day!!
My dad a gumball machine when we were kids it had a stand and since my dads a hoarder he probably still has it complete with gumballs.
I think The squishy sloth should be named Wayne  😅
LOVE IT!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️ Love you too Moriah! ❤️
The duck chicken family should be the duckin family
Ok I’m sorry buuuuut.... GUMBALL MACHINE ITS A GUUUUUM BAAAAAALL MACHINNNNEEE

*Moriah if you have a Base warehouse at your state or live near one please try it :> it’s really good and there are nice plain white birds, Decore, and so much more you can paint on!*
Whenever she brings out the poscas I just get  so happy for some reason lol
Pin this if you love your fans
You should make the bubble gum characters into Merch. Please like and re-comment so she can see this.
Can I invite Burt to my brothers b day cause it is next week and I also want him at my b day :) 🦥
When i thought you were gonna paint on  chewing gum 😂😳
you should have done the chicken floating with the gum up higher to make it look like it was flying away
I love your channel!😍
i knew it was RAINBOW :>
Hey
Paint on the rubber ducks
GIRL YOU DO NOT LOOK 26 YOU LOOK LIKE AN 18 YEAR OLD WHAAATT????
Oo you should do a video turning pins youve made into squishys for a squishy makeover^^
pls no spoilers I’m like two seconds into the vid, but it wud be so cool if she made a rainbow-stained glass effect on the glass part, and out fairy lights inside it!
I love your top so much omg.
This is so. Stinkin. CUTE. Nelson is favorite 💚
Me when I saw the thumbnail: I HAVE THAT I HAVE THAT😂
I love your videos!
How do you people send things to you
Can you please do create this book 2 next Friday? Thanks if you do! 😊
I never even noticed that you've switched backgrounds until you say so
*Moriah: Hits herself with the bubblegum machine* Me: ouch-
EARLY YAYAYAY
*is it just me that waits and waits on moriahs channel until she uploads*
Nelson should be a squishy or a plush!
My name is Lucy and to hear Moriah name one of her characters Lucy made my freaking day. I am fully online for school and it was a long day that sucked, so that was great to hear. I love you so much Moriah and I love watching your videos. Also, one of my classes for school uses your Creat This Book. I am not an artist, but I'm excited for it.
Bert will now be bertholdt Change my mind
I have a new house now!?
If I was her, every time i walk past I would end up eating a peice of gum and it would be gone in like a week😂
Plz notice me 🥺
Hiii I’m a big fan!! And I’m trying to be an artist but I’m not that good.
I feel like it would have been cool if you filled it with pom poms, but this is really cool as well! ^^
Christmas is all year  because Moriah post!
Haiiiii
Fridays are moriah Elizabeth days
oh my gosh!!! at 5:46 i have the same shirt 😂
Moriah you are my favorite YouTuber and I am your biggest fan. You are so good at art!
Love it❣️
I saw your video and instantly knew that you where fans paint this
Haha the machine isn't wak.... its just that your gumballs are tiny not the large ones, but I gues you could say thier wack. hahha. I love you so much it turned out great!
Favorite thrift store makeover!
She did us dirty when she advertised for candy crush
Is it just me or I want Moriah to sell the Gum ball Machine- 🧍‍♀️

Fun fact: you are most likely not subscribed

I think Mariah made up a secret language that only us viewers/subscribers understand😂😂
She should have a randomly colored gradient (rainbow) song, since she paints it on everything 😂 like the sprinkle song
I love this probably one of my fav DIYs from you!
Lol! This was a funny episode of thrift store makeovers! "Like" if you agree!
am I the only one who thinks a gumboil machine would make a super pretty terrarium?

It's dispensing more than 1 because the size you got was too small...
This looks so cute! Such a good job of this makeover 😍
when i first saw the hint of what she is gojng to draw i was like: WAIT A MINUTE IS SHE GOING TO PAINT A GUM HOW AND WHY AND HOW AGAIN then i saw the comments everyone was like A GUM MACHINE  and then i was like: Oh i guess i am the only dumb one here
Claim you "Here before 6 mil subscribers" ticket here  CONGRATS MORIAH ❤
Can i sent you some stuff
my grandma has that same thing
Hi have a great day 🌈🍓🦄🍩🍉🍭🍪🍩🐶🦊🍒🌞🍭🍪
The dislikes are from the gooey price stickers
we were right (only people who saw the short or whatever u call it know)
You are legitimately the only reason I ever know it's Friday lmao
Tell me why I just screamed when I saw this
I love rosy like if u I agree we need merch!!
i was on my phone and i just saw it and ya i partyd
Time saver.  It’s just pastel rainbow. The glass is full of her characters. Done.
Yay love u moriah !!!!!!!
Your jumper is really nice
You could glue a pastel coloured fabric on the inside instead of painting to hide the red!
Moriah: I will do that another day, I swear  4000 episodes later: I one had this design................
At least it’s not the unspeakable sticker 😂
I'M HERE!!!
me: thinks im creative by painting something new on a canvas  Moriah: paints on gumball machine  Me: wow I am not creative at all
When she said she had only  and 1/2 half bags left she really as 6.5. She just forgot the original bag she ordered. Sorry to correct. But also your videos are one of the highlights of my week.
I love the finish
when she said no more sound affects i was like nooooo i love the sound affects
before it was a "screeeeeeeee" and then it was a "veeeeaaloop"
If you want her to paint rubber ducks like this comment
Omg... one of the best creations by far 😍😍😍😍 mama and daughter her who look forward to watching the videos first this Sat morning (we're in Australia, US Friday is our Sat )
Can we just respect the amount of bubble gum leftover lmao 😂😂😂
Omg yay! A character finally has my name!!!!❤️💕
This is my favourite makeover of all time. The concept is so creative. Thank you for being such a sweet escape from the stress of the world right now💖
Moriah you can add small  costumize pin or squeshies in the gumball machine.
me on thursday: I cant wait for a new vid me on friday: AAAAA NEW VIDEO BUT IM LATE
PLEASE MAKE HEADPHONE MERCH MORIAH!! Pleeeeeaasse!
How is she so pretty
Glow up am I right
Do you ever feel numb inside and want to jump off a cliff but then you watch one of her videos and after 1 min you feel better
Yay
My name is Lucy and the cats name is Lucy👀                                                                                                                                                         𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗔𝗬𝗬𝗔😌😌😌
No one: Literally no one: Moriah:How old am I? Oh im 26 whats your point?🤣
Super rare? 2:11
You should try turning all the foodamal pins into squishys like Georgie
Tell me why I thought she was going to pain literal gum 😶
my favorite part was when the gesso laughed demonically at me
Lol i love this video
it the face in the gesso for me
Ya!
You and nerdecrafter should make a YT channel together
OMG I HAVE THE EXACT SAME one
Why don't you give the bubble gum to homeless/shelter and you know I don't think they will need the bubble gums but like better then it laying around
Video Idea:  Follow one of those "What should I paint?" Quizzes on the internet.
Hi!!!!!
Fun Fact: I don’t have a fun fact.
omgoshhhh u should have made it like a fish tank and like withe all sorts of colors of blue and bubles and fish and sharks and bla bla bla i was reeeeeeealllyyyyyyyyyy hopping u would do that so now im just disapointed , darn it , well at least u now have an idea ...'[][][][][][][][]'   like a fish tank  altho i still love ur buble gum machine idea][][][][][][
Too much rainbow. :(  I wish Moriah would do other stuff besides rainbow, too much rainbow.
I love your sweater
Imagine if moriah went goth
Well I'm going to go decorate my gumball machine now seriously I have one
What a coincidence! Today’s my birthday. She uploaded on my birthday 🥳   Best birthday gift LMAO!!
Was at the farm cleaning tack and just came home to this haven’t even ended it and know it’s gonna be great! 😁
Hiiiii
can i do this  no do i want to  yes
I love this video you r my favorite YouTuber BYW 🥰
i love it its so cool
Moriah: talks to objects  Me: well that’s completely normal Random person: talks to themselves  Me: well that’s just strange  OMG thank you for all the likes it’s so funny to read all the reply’s 😂🤣
Put the Gumball machine in your background
she hasnt painted the "elsewhere" spot yet so im gonna guess its the clear part  edit: HAHA I WAS RIGHT
Remove 90 cents from the price, people of quality know what to reply.
You should fill the gun ball machine with little squishys
Omg she should do a following a bob ross tutorial video!!!! Copy and paste!
Hii
She is almost at 6mill yaaaaaas
Awwwww noooooo I got it wrong 🥲
Hi
I finally got my Georgie jumper 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I love moriahs shirt
A little odd to paint on but...... COOL 😎
She said i bought 7. It fits 2.5 so i have 5.5 left. That is 8😂
Moriah you are my BIGGEST inspiration, I used to think i was never good at art but then i found your channel and you have inspired me to keep drawing and i am now AMAZING AT IT
Love seeing your name pop up on my notifications! New video yay!!  * Starts jaming out to intro *
"gooey price stickers should be illegal"
I love how the gumball machine turned out and I love how good you are at art         😁
PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS PLEASE I WATCH EVERY VID OF URS OVER AND OVER!😍😂
That is amazing! 🤗 Great job!
I love your vids
You almost at 6 mil subs :D
I missed puppy the pumpkin
You should put tiny squishy in their to Dispense them
She’s really good at this! She should do it for a living.
Random idea to solve the promblem withe where the gumballs drop: if you hotglue some kind of felt in there it should be fine right?
I just had an idea what if Moriah Elizabeth painted her art room wall with all the charters she made! I don't know if I'm spelling is right please don't judge.
Nelson I like that he should be some tiny plushy’s like awkward plushy to be on your backpack he’s like oh....hello
OMG A RAINBOW CHOCLATE CAT NAMED AFTER ME!!! YEY!!!
It looks so cute! how does she made a masterpiece every week?
I missed these vids
Okay so she said the mean of the artwork and then all of a sudden a meat market add appeared
With the left over bubble gum you should do gum art!
IF U ARE SEEIN G THIS SUBSRIBE NO IF U HAVENT ALREADY!!
Maybe you can do an asmr painting video?
here before 1 mill? by the way i’m not a bot i post stuff
My cat is fat 🙂
WHY SHE GOTTA BE SO TALENTED!
Like this for painted ducks
Oh my goodness I just painted a gumball musheen
Yassssssss
I SAW YOU ON AN ADD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love it!!!
why are all her comments self promoters? ya'll our queen doesn't deserve that.
SHE MUST DO A 6 MILLION SUBRIBER GIVEAWAY
I love it! It looks so good!!! I love Moriah she’s like my favorite Youtuber she’s funny, and dramatic and I just love her personality and she’s AMAZING!!!!!  And her art is like...THE BEST MY EYES HAVE EVER SEEN, Moriah let me just tell you, your popping my eyes off of my body because your art is so good! I love you!!!
i was eating gum diring this vid

If I was you I would wash it
You finally posted yay
WOOOOOO love these videos
It's so pretty can you paint rubber ducks next?? I have and idea        GeOrGiE

For your next video u should do “following a Bob Ross totorial”
I was right!
Petition for moriah to fill it with her squishy makeover mini squishes??
So. Many. People.
You should paint a xylophone!
you could also done a clear coat on only the characters..... just saying
You know what we need to see painting lamps
Her outfit is adorable fr-
OMG I'm early!
Whenever I hear bubblegum I always think of forest gunp when it’s bubba gump although it isn’t even a bubble gum company it’s actually a shrimp one 😅 I know I’m weird

I have a cold :(
here in the first hour and i subbed uwu
Can we just appreciate how moriah used some of her less known characters
I love this video
I know its a technical error from editing of something but I wonder what exactly caused the blue bar of "New frames need Analyzing; click Analyze." And "Frame not analyzed for stabilization; click Analyze."  Also, I wonder if she knows thats in the video?
You could have made it ice cream
I'm 24 and people think I'm 15 too 😬 you are my spirit animal, thank you for your unapologetic existence!
:))))))) BuBbLe GuM
LOL I just see frame not analyzed (14:15 time) for stabilization: click Analyzed. LOL I laughed so hard.
YES SHES BACK THE QUEEN
0:55 you can see the price tag 😂
Me : Yay I am Early YouTube: Like 1 hour later  Me:😭😡
I knew this was the video you were posting from the Instagram post
When I sAw moriah post I was running so fast
Lucy is my name :)
Moriah: “..try to utilize the transparent nature of the substrate..”  me: Wut Moriah: in other words, ME WANTS TO TRACE!! me : I get it! Edit: lol all these likes
I love how confident she is to put those video like in the things

GET A MIDDLE PART
I love Nelson!!!
I've never seen a gumball machine.
I loved it
“But I did get a bunch of dead human skin cells... free!” 😂😂
Moriah : takes out rainbow 🌈 paint  Me : YAYYYYYYYY😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
What if she put small squishies into the gimbal machine instead of actual gum ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
Oo I love gum that’s why me mum have no more gum in her purse 😂🤌
Ello
Oh look, she’s giving Tom Servo a makeover!
Me first: OMG IM FIRST -Battery dead- Me: Oh, ok. *charges* I’m still first it’s barley been 5 minutes- 5 minutes later: 7k comments
anylazing frames

Does anyone else want her to do something Opie themed?❤️🐱
LOVE THE SWEATERRRRRRRR 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
For some reason this idea randomly occurred to me when I was watching the video, can you do a crafting with clay video? That would be fun!
That gumball machine gettin a little spicy
the reflection on the glass wasn't distracting until you said it.
WHAT IS A BUBBLE GUM MACHINE???? ITS A GUM BALL MACHINE! I’m joking luv ur vids

The bubble gum machine is Nice..
I  WAS RIGHT!!!!
Wow just wow 🤩
Finally a new video

Waiting for moriah’s video torture’s me  a week is like an eternity 😂
Could you please do a Bake with Me? I really enjoy those!
I loved it so much but you forgot to add your initials
Omg I have the same name as the icesmorenut cat!
She should put all her small paintings in there! Like her pins, maybe smaller squishies (for extra space :P)
AHHH IM EARLY LOVE U MORIAH
I wish I had this much creativity to make my own characters..😔 anyways girl your so close to 6 million subscribers! 🥳
Goodwill is my moms happiness
When she said but then i notice (add pops up) The add: Tonight i'll eating a sweet potato fries (delivery comes) Thanks
Anyone else see “New frames need analyzing. Click here to analyze.”?
I have one of those bubble gum machines
She should put her shrink plastic pins inside the bubblegum machine. It would look so cool!
Hi i forgot your from 2019 but i will still watch u, i saw your video rn now im watching your video
You should make people pay for the gum so you can get the money lol
I love GeOrGiE. I preordered the plushy ASAP and he is in front of all my fancy decor pillows
That was a so good after finish
I love you
Bubble gum.
Mariah is my favourite YouTuber and she only uploads every Friday. I make sure I have not missed her vids! I live you Moriah

me when I see her new video:EEEEEEEEEEEEEE *clicks a thousand times*
“Clean and healthy be moriah”
I Cant even paint a flower Gurl i need tips your the best person ik Or anyone teach me
Hey we once had a gumball machine like that
you could put a piece of felt in the hole to hide the red :) or some kind of paper or fabric :)
When I got ur merch for Christmas I screamed coz I was so happy
MORIAH ELIZABETH you should make that bubble gum machine in to merch!!!!!!!!! that would be AWESOME!!!!!!
U should use the panda buns and glue them together and paint them to look like gumballs
Happy 6M! 😁
RAINBOW OMG WHY
I love how moriah puts in funny random clips of herself! 😂😂😂
Pls make a song about squishys
I have this machine, you can actually adjust how much money it needs to work. It's kinda confusing tho.
Hello

Mariah:burt  Me: my cousin named his cat burt because when his mom farted it sounded like her farts were saying Burt
You 👏 are 👏 so 👏 talented 👏
Why didn’t you use your glass paint?
It isn't letting me reply to people....
Moriah: walks in to the thriftstore The employees: no... Not her again...   Edit: thank you for so many likes i have never got this many! ❤️
I really want to know the name of the dramatic piano song she played
Moriah, I was wondering if I where to send you something when you might get to it, like a month, 6 months or a year etc.
I love watching your vids! Every time you post I’m filled with excitement. Keep doing what you do, your work is amazing and beautiful!
And this.. this is why I don't get gum at machines.
That looks cool
This made me really want gum 😭
Sorry, but the sound quality is really off in this video 😕 not great to listen to without having to continuously turn the volume up or down.
omg omg here me out- after you paint the ducks, if the fit MAKE A DUCKBALL DISPENSER
If y'all expect Moriah to make a video without including rainbows, then you clearly haven't been stanning her long enough.
This was posted an hour ago, and there are already 10k comments. That says something🤩🤩🤩
Dead skin cells...         FREEEEEEEEE!
Why isn’t anyone talking about her amazing sweater?!
Week 6 of requesting Moriah souls paint on paintbrushes  Pls like so she sees  Xoxo
yes, she did a gumball machine!
I LOVE it
Anyon else that can’t replie to some ppl
Can I have one of the bags please
I love her videos and I think they are so funny, it's always great when she makes a new one
You should make a puppy the pumpkin stuff animal          Like if you agree                👇🏻👇🏻
I have the same gum ball machine
If you want an idea you could put squishies or pins or something else like that in it i thik it would be cool. Btw i love your vids you have  inspired me and keep on going.
Isn’t Moriah just so funny in the thrift store makeover
I loved this!!!! I want one now.
I’m very scared, the monster has the same name as my dog
Maam we need a aunt derp and uncle derp
I LOVE all your little characters, I could see an actually children's TV cartoon with them
Does anyone else never see the background chanhes?
This was amazing! I love the end result!!!!  Love your videos Moriah! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
Hi, I started watching your Chanel a few months ago and now I look for old videos to watch because I watched all of your newest ones
Omg I want bubble gum now (I have a bubble gum addiction and I’m not joking)
I love your vids so much!! Your so creative and funny!
Her: it’s the dresser that never ends then a creepy face pops out me:😰😨😰😨
Jello
Who here is wondering why she didn't do a squishy makeover in 2 months? Pls do love these to but ... It's *squishys*
Its funny that I really dont see any of that backround changes until you say it
Why did I guess you'd do rainbow
Who is just reading the comments as she talks
Meet Moriah Elizabeth: the mechanic who can put together a gumball machine
I have one of those excepted one of the big ones
I love the sweater
I literally got that same gumball machine yesterday what is this
Best art influencer I give you all my love🌈❤️🌈❤️
This is so cute!
RUBBER DUCKS 🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆 MORIAH 😡
Wow Moriah, that looks amazing!!! It’s probably one of my favorite pieces yet, :D you’re an amazing artist and I always love your work! Thank you for putting your art out there to inspire people like me to not be afraid of being creative, you’re a true Jem 😊
Love the video, you should do a squishy unboxing video next if you aren't already making a different one!
do you accept fanart for your characters? they're too cute
Moriah has gotten way too many memes from her “I turned myself into a cupcake” video😂😂
Hi moriah I have a video ideor husband paints squishy
Love ur videos. Good idea moriah
How did I know it was going to be rainbow or if we are being exact random gradients of color
I love your videos. Also just an idea you could paint on masks because ya know corona :b
1 hour squad!!
Moriah..ITS BEAUTIFUL🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡💖💖💖💖💖😭😭
I absolutely love the bubble gum machine. You should put that as a part of your Merch later on.
•                      •   •                • •                      •
💖💖
At 12:31 it had a blue thing saying ‘new frames need blah blah blah’ did anyone else see that?
There are special made pasca pens made to paint glass
Me:painting, messing up Moriah:how about I make a channel where I paint squishes, thrift store products, and so many more!!! (All of her art turns out perfectly) Me: 😱
Bidddd
What happened with the editing sorry Moriah love you
How did I not get the bubble gum clue I'm so dumb😂
Why do I feel like Albert is a great name for the scared chicken?
you do this 5am or something
Moriah’s art has officially become an✨asthetic✨
Me:gets out of school and goes on my phone and sees this video   YAY 😁
Moriah: starts painting pink  Me: Rainbow.
sup        been a year, glad to see you still love rainbows
Hi
I really like how it turned out.
you should go on nailed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The gumball machine she's painting in the video I have 2 of them my mom has one and I have one of course mine is cracked lol.
Moriah: I’m not going to include Cousin Derp, Georgie, or Pickle. Everyone: WhErE iS mY lAwEr!?
Moriah: I'm going to use the top hat to match creating the same rainbow-I mean randomly colored gradient. Me: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!😂😅
MORIAH ELIZABETH MORIAH ELIZABETH MORIAH ELIZABETH let’s see if this work please pin meh
I am obsessed with the new version
When you first pulled out the machine I wanted you to fill it with tiny squishies so bad! but this is very very cute too :)
Rubber duck painting just has to happen it has to 😂😊😍
Moriah you should strap that machine in the public somewhere say its 25 cent or whatever and make some money! :)
My cat’s name is LUCY !! :D
I love ittttt
Make this ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ into something
less than a min and i can TELL this vid is gonna be AMAZUNG
Yeah I mean I’d have dunked that in warm water and washing up liquid, given it a good scrub before i’d even be satisfied it’s clean.
🍌
At first I thought you where going to do a girl in a big dress 👗 and hat 👒
New frames need analyzing:click Analyze.
I love this video!!!!
Did u change ur intro
So cool I have one like that. God bless and have a wonderful day.
What's the difference from gesso and white paint
I literally couldn’t see her reflection in the glass until she pointed it out.
Can you paint squishys
The comments section is already 10k comments like HECK?!?! The vid only came out an hour ago ppl
I love to hear the words "hey it's me" every Friday
no moriah, you bought the skin cells and got the gum ball machine free 😁‼️
ME EE
I love your videos
This is what u did and then I get an add MoDeRn LiFe
“ThE gEsSo tHaT nEvEr EnDs”
I'm seeing this when it was made a hour ago omg🥺😊👑
New merch idea 👀😂
"It's been marinatin' in my mind." - Moriah, 2021
*okay*
OMG hi
Moriah you are so talented and amazing I LOVE you and your vids!you were born to do this hope you stay safe! You are the best!
Me:OH YES SOME ACCTUALLY SATISFAYING THING
Ok who else just knew she was going to do rainbow?
She says her face is distracting... yes it distracted me by her amazingness!
I love Moriah and I most definitely will keep watching her videos but every time I see her paint yet ANOTHER rainbow themed item I lose another brain cell 🤓
Hello Mariah, I hope you see this comment in like it and because it's my turn to get pinned  I just want to say you are best person ever, you always make me happy on how weird you are, I hope you see this comment, I just really hope he do, and I also guessed that I was gumball machine first. So PIN ME MY MORIAH-CHAN
Yesterday was my birthday 🎂🥳🥳
Video idea you find a children’s toy at a thrift store and you give it a makeover and then you give it to an orphanage the video could be called thrift store makeover with a twist
I love moriah so much!!!!
hey maybe you could paint the clear part? so you don’t have to see the red and also you don’t have to worry about it chipping :)
Me watching this an hour after it came out $×$
I WAS LITTERALLY BINGE WATCHING THESE TWO SECONDS AGO AND I AM SO SURPRISED U JUST HAPPENED TO MAKE INE TODAY
ok this is really sad but this is the earliest ive ever been to your video
Hellooo
First
i just said i did not want one of those in my bedroom HOOOW. how did they know!?!         and also thats how you get the cash out
I see art, I click
I'm you bigger fan
Lol
Well ello there 😁
Same
i want to draw unused characters nilla: am i a joke to you
I luv it! Ur an amazing artist!
3:21 IT GOES ON AND ON AGAIN...---
Im a huge fan I even have a pickle hoodie on right now that I got for my b day keep up the amazing work and never stop being you girl❤
Omg u should assign a certain type of squishes and put all of the ones u decorate in there
You could put a vinyl sticker to line the red inside to change the colour without worrying about chipping
I want a bubblegum machine this is how much everyone else wants bubblegum machine
sub to Moriah Elizabth She is so goooddddd
Hi,U maje my day so much happier you are funny and well amazing luv u
If she didn’t say anything about the background change, I wouldn’t have notice the background change
Hi.I’m 😔 sad(edit)I’m not sad anymore
I actually love this
I deleted a comment that I made idk why:p welp I hope nobody wants to know what I promise i didn't say anything bad
The world ends when the Gesso ends
i was having a really horrible day, and honestly this video saved it x
Omg
wait moriah should put a price of paper in that slot so it goes better
You could’ve painted the bottom as an icecream cone and whatever you put in the glass is the ice cream and then the red top as a cherry
hi i <\3 your vis
I like how Moriah is funny and so skilled 😊
I sit just me or did Moriah post this 2 hours eairler??
I just realised moriah is left handed!
she's 26 and dosent have any kids🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🤧🤧
(not an original idea, Im just passing this on) *PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKIES*
Moriah: walks in thrift store Thrift store employees: oh no she is back🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♂️
You scared me with that gesso
I love your personality  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Who else always waits for Friday just for Moriah?

Today I was wearing my Georgie hat and someone just yelled " gEoRGiE!!!"
Scary holes and everlasting gesso....what more could ya want? 1 2 3 4 5  Actually can someone name some things for me
I love your sweater.
How abaut burtrum for the sloth
Moroah is the most talented person i ever seen who aggrees  👇💟
Moriah you should do more bake with mes because as a future baker baker, i think its funny how you bake. P.S. i think you do a great job! Just dontt waste the food!
When I saw this, I thought it would be really cool to make into a small fish tank, and do an aquatic theme on the base.
The characters look like they could be stickers 😍 soooooo cute!
Hi Mariah I'm a big fan and you think you can probably give me a shout out cuz I've been a fan for 2 years and I love for you and also you inspired me to start crafting and I have the Georgie plush and I have all the other plushies and a ton of your merch I love you
5:58 I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU IN A WHILE AND YOU ARE INCONIC
I would be here earlier But I got stuck watching camp cretaceous season 2
What about Nila the dog doughnut
*who else loves Moriah Elizabeth?*
I have a question for a joke in 1 video... Next time can you put on a mask only when you show your face UwU
I love these so much! I wanna have a go at it too!
Nobody:  Me: **Is early** Also Me: *LeTs nOt CoMmEnT aNd cOmMeNt tHe sEcOnD TiMe i wAtCh*  Yes. That’s right. I watch the same video twice within 2 hours.
Video idea for Moriah Elizabeth: Paint mini squishies in the gum ball Machine if it works I’m not even done watching the vid
Bubblegum machine: EEeEEeEeeEeeeEe Me: Wait did Opie come into the room?
New year new intro :) What i mean is maybye a new intro i mean u had that intro for about 1 year
Here when it was posted 6 minutes ago
I DO NOT LIKE THE GREEN ONE PLZ DO NOT LET HIM COME BAKE

*Sammy The Sloth.......!~

Has anyone else's internet just been really really really slow? Like you are so sick of that loading circle?
I knew it
ME GuMBALL EVERYONE ELSE can I have ice cream IDK IS IT JUST ME OR U THINK THAT I SHOULD PAINT MYSELF INTO A GUMBALL
Moriah: That looked like a screeching sound Me: umm....something can look like a sound? EDIT: OMG!!! 180 likes!! Thank you so much!
So beautiful love the rainbow colors so unique I want one🌈
Me: *comments on video, 'icesmorenut'* Moriah: 'icesmorenut', that's a terrible name Me: .__. okidoki then
Me: What if one of her characters happens to be a lot like me, that would be funny! Moriah: 7:33 😐
super cute and unique! loved it :)

Best Birthday present ever!!!!!!
GAH I´M LATE AND I GOT NO NOTIFICATION (why I don´t watch youtube on my laptop)

Can u please play Roblox
scared chicken's name is totally Junior
other craft channels: *painting in a canvas* moriah:              *oh hey, it’s just me, painting everything on this craft store shelf*
I feel like maybe dry brushing like a metallic or maybe the gesso would have made the coin portion blend a little better. I love this concept though, good job!
Hi guys I love you Moriah Elizabeth your the best I love your vids..... and I just made a yt channel it’s about ASMR if you want to check it out it’s like ASMR slime video that’s the name of one of the vids and click on the profile picture and there are my videos hope all of you have a good day.

Omgsh I love this sm!💖

Hi
Who  has been watching  her for 8 years
It is so cute !
I think I would use it as a sort of piggy bank. Bc you can put the money you want to save in it and get a reward for doing so, too
Girl you're so talented im working on my drawing skills wish me luck (❤´艸｀❤)
I have one of those❤️❤️
VIDEO IDEA: make a full deck of cards each one with a different character on it. multiple parts
That was amazing the gumball mashing looked soo cool. 🥰
In 1 million years I never thought you’ll be paying to get bubblegum machine
(Copy and paste so moriah sees) Do a painting on rubber ducks series  (Not my idea)
Me? Early?
3:51 "but then I noticed...." Ad: "CHARMIN ULTRA SOFT IS TWICE AS ABSORBENT.. ENJOY THE GO WITH CHARMIN!"   I'm not kidding... this really did happen. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love your vids
this is adorable !
Can anyone else believe she actually spent like $100 on just the bubblegum?!
But I like the sound effects
NELSON

The only intro that never gets old. Like, how?
Is it just me or does everyone say hey when she says "Hey it's me"
please do a Q&A soon I am cringing if you will put my question in the video
Lol
I have that one!
i would by that if I could
I’m obsessed with Nelson
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG THAT MAKEOVER WAS AWESOME 👏🏻 😆😆😆😆😆  THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR BEST ONES YET 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
I feel like the sloth is more like a Sully🤷🏼‍♀️
Ha I guess it
I thought it would be so cute if she would if don’t a fish bowl theme! But I love the outcome of this, it looked so good!!
44 minutes ago!!!!! 😃😃😃😃😃
Love watching you!!!
It’s so cute I love it.
You could put mini squishys inside
How do people get thousands of likes within 3 hours?!
I thought you were painting on gum rappers-
I just realized now that she is left handed😮
MORIAH BRING BACK CRATE THIS BOOK TWO PLZZZZZZZZ
This. Is. Dumb. PRESS READ MORE!               I have never had a piece of gum from one of these machines
my daughter Kiana said you could paint the flap where the bubblegum comes out so it covers the red.
You might need to give makeovers to more gumball machines to use all that gum! I loved it so much!
Hiiiiiiiiii
Love it so much! Super cute
Moriah wasn’t the art teacher we deserved, but needed.
Called it
She could’ve filled it with tiny squishies
me:am i gonna be the first to comment.Now:dang noooo!!!
kinda early  edit: more like 1hour late
New frames need analyzing click to analise
Five years from now Moriah is  still gonna have half a jar of gesso :p    Also anyone else get kind of scared when Moriah didn't say that the top was rainbow but instead randomly colored?
I loved your Viedeos
Please make this a product I would IMMEDIATELY BUY!!!!!!  Like if you agree😄👇🏼
OMG UR ALMOST AT 6 MIL 🤯
IK IT
I love how her own ad was put in between the video. She literally just said "but then I noticed" "ThErE aRe So MaNy  ReAsOnS tO pLaY cAnDy CrUsH"
(Day 2) Moriah, I was watching an art video with posca pens, and I found a way to mix colors to make pastels (or any other color U want) basically u can get a paint pallet and tap the marker tips on the pallet, then you can get the other color u want to mix it with and get a brush to mix the colors together. Hope this helps! (Like to moriah can see!) ❤️❤️
What was that tool you used????
Elizabeth:6.99 Me:Omg did you just say 69?i didn’t know you knew him...
I HAVE AN IDEAR!! What if Moriah took a couple small squishys that look similar (like the panda buns) and put them inside! This might be a dum idea but I think it would look kinda cute.
I got the slippers from moriah at Christmas I'm so excited I love them
i wish rosie was drawn more often because she is my favourite!!
You should make a vid about paring unpaired shqushys
Love it !
Anyone think it would be cool if you painted on one of those little wooden mannequins that help you draw a person.👍🖌🎨
I love it Moriah!
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE A PHONE CASE FOR THE IPOD TOUCH 8TH GEN!?
I look forward to every Friday when I come home from school and get to watch her vids and eat my food
I LOVE YOU MORIAH YOU ARE THE BEST
Moriah:hits table with elbow Next action:BEING TRIGGERED
Me: struggleing to peel of the price tag sticker                                                                                                                                                                                         Moria: easily takes it off with her nails like if you agree
I've been checking yt all day for this moment!:D
I was wrong....
when will we find out about the giant pickle the Dina suit plush give away!?!
I’m pretty sure you need like a quarter size ball in these ones vrs the small ones you got.
Love it❤️
i love these videos and i love the customised bubble gum machine. its so PRETTY!!!
Wawawawawaw
🍀☺🍀☺🍀☺ I LOVE♥ YOUR ╔╗╔╦╗╦ ╦  ╦═╗ ╚╗║║║║ ║  ╠╣ ╚╝╝╝╝╩ ╩╝╩═╝ 😄🎀😄🎀😄🎀
No joke I have the same exact one
Why are there 196 dislikes???????? HUH PEOPLE!!!!!!??????!!!!!
I’m ngl the “huh huh shhh” made me laugh more than it should have
Ok Lucy Nelson and Burt are my dogs names I’m scared
Wow moriah this is the best thing you’ve created it’s AMAZING 😍😍😍😍💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
What no 5.97 people saw this in 1 hour
This was so creative!!! Love you so much!!!
This was an hour ago...
I love it it’s soooo cool 👍🏻😁
please send me some of your bubblegum here's my email ejmckillips@gmail.com
*I am 1 hour late*
who else agrees moriah elizabeth needs to decorate a rubix cube with different charecters of hers on instead of colours
I didn’t even realise the backgrounds changed until you said 😂
Every Friday after school I’ll wait to hear the words hey it’s me
so fun!
Hey Moriah! If you don’t want to see the red on the inside of the machine, maybe try painting on the outside of the plastic flap. Then you don’t have to worry about see the red or chipping. Hopefully this helps 😁
How did 5 million people see this in 1 hour
hi, my goal for youtube is only 20 subs and if you can help to make that happen that will be great btw i sub back!
What’s your zodiac sign? First video I’m asking
If Moriah went on a rainbow restriction I don't think she could make videos. Love you Moriah
Moriah:background change this happens a lot in this video  Me: she finally actullay does random color and she didn't even notice And wow it looks amazing the gum ball thing
Moriah: No more sound effects A few minutes later: mUaHhHh Me: hOw dArE yOu LiE tO mE!  #Oof
Nelson Beefed
Love it all 👌😗
9:33 Moriah: when in doubt posca paint pens  M: when in doubt posca paint pens come out😂
Idk if this will help but for the issue of the red on the inside maybe you could cut and stick some paper in there or something similar to that idk just a suggestion.

9:49 Flashbacks 😳  In grade 10, my art class was donated a couple of old windows (sorta antique-y with the frames). I was picked to paint one for the local fair...  AHHHH Painting on glass with our budget acrylics AHHHH Paint pulling of every time I tried to add a layer AHHHH Scrape it off try it again AHHHH Matte modge podge being a make shift saviour AHHHH  😖 Never again
I wish I could have that it s one off your best and i love it
Video idea: your husband picks the squishies you makeover
I am once again asking to make a icecream with expresso and chocolate chunks (your choice if milk chocolate chunks or dark choclate chunks but i would rather have dark chocolate or salted caramel.)

I Love You 🥺 Your so good
Get her to 6 million everyone!!
For getting off price sticker residue Goo Gone spray is the best! I always keep some on hand, one bottle will last you a LONG time. Really handy when I moved to my new apartment and was buying new things I needed for it in a short period of time.
Did she know that inside the part where the gum comes out is still all red- or did she mean to- 🤨
I have the same gumball machine at my house! 😂
Thus has got to be my favourite thrift store makeover EVER it’s so cute and original and I love how you painted on the glass as well xxxx
I knew that the clue from the last video is  for a bubble gum machine !
love it
IT LOOKS SO CUTE!!! 😍🤗
I love how the gumball character looks and I got your merch i have the blanket right now I love it I hope you are reading this

If she decorates the ducks she should put them in the bubble gum Machine
Hi I'm not a popular YouTuber I'm super cringy so if I can trick you you have to sub to me! 😈  ... Read more
Can we see you paint rubber ducks? Also, when Moriah said she shouldn’t be teaching this. Literally the 50% of comments saying,” Who else would love Moriah to be there teacher?” That gets like 4.1k likes: NANI?!

TAKING ATTENDANCE FOR EVERYONE WHO WANT MORIAH TO PAINT THE PRINCE FROG SAY “HERE”!

Also, what song do you use for your intro? I love it so much!!!
Did you put your Me?
Moriah u are the best and i love to watch your videos its so great to watch u
You should do gesso vs white paint
I'll take some bumble! ^-^
Nelson Beefed
Fun fact: I don’t have a fun fact 🙃
Nobody Nobody at all Absolutely no one Moriah:I am doing a simple design of random colors Proceeds to do a ombre with the  rainbow that takes forever 😂😆😂😆
Please paint a whole deck of playing card that would be awesome!!!  Copy and paste to make this happen
Gumball machine is the perfect thing to paint 🎨 I love it 🥰
i guessed it right                               i wasted your time lol
Didn’t the lighting look kinda dark
Nelson Beefed
It has been posted for 1 hour and already 10k comments ☠️
I like her thrift shop series 😌✨
When she gave the hint, I thought she was painting on actual gum piece 😂
Moriah: characters part of the video  Me: dying of laugh 😂
Nelson beefed
I GOT HERE OWNLY WON HOUR AGO
I forgooottt agaaainn
Pls do the rubber ducks pls
She is a genius that doesn’t brag
Nelson Beefed
I think the sloth should be named Benjamin or Ben
hey Moriah why don't you try airbrushing? of course it takes a learning curve but it could make your thrift makeovers a lot easier and faster!!
I love it to❤️
Goey price tags should be illegal - moria elizabeth 2021
i wanted you to make a sea with fish on the ball part
Soooo stinkin’ cute!
I knew it
Did you guys know she wasn't using the colors in rainbow order.
IM SO NEW
There is a fake channel of Maria it is called Maria Elizabeth me pls read this
Please spray paint the silver area it looks a little bit off and maybe you can paste a paper inside the bubble gum hole with a glue rather then painting it and yes you did an amazing job love you 😘
moriah:  brace yourself Me: (puts on glasses) ok I’m ready
Claim your  "I'm a Moriah Elizabeth fan ticket"  here before it's sold out! <3
What if she puts sprinkles in it instead of bubble gum!?!?! ( just a suggestion please dont get the idea that I'm telling you what to do. )
i love how i literally got moriahs candy crush ad during her video
I haven’t seen the video yet but i think she would paint a pond and duck scene but like those rubber duck
I love the idea of the cartoon characters on the glass dome. 💜
i have the same one at my house
why rainbow every time!?
Ello Moriah! Maybe paint on cardboard boxes from all your mail? Make a fort or sumthin?
No one:							me:looking at moriah’s face on the bubble gum machine reflection
I have the exact same thing. I actually walked around my whole house to make sure I still had it lmao.
Hi I love your videos and always watch them keep making videos. I am weird like you. I love you. Also I want to send you my box of squishies. I love you ❤️.
Week 1 of reminding Moriah to paint the Easter squishies
Omg I haven't even watched the vid but I love it and hope you keep on posting
I love that most of the things Moriah customizes things that are (I think) inside jokes! If any outsider sees like that they’ll just be “uh..cute thing”
Omg shes not lowsign any money lol she can just go inside the mishean  and collect all of it .it surves two purpeses a gumball mishean and a pigy bagnk 😄!
It’s really cool that your names initials make up ME. I also really love your style!
Out of all the items you've ever painted, THIS IS MY FAVORITE!!!  OH MY GOODNESS, THIS IS SOOOO VERY AWESOME!!! Great job Moriah!!!
Hi
Absolutely my favourite makeover so far!!
Rainbows 🌈 rainbows 🌈 and more rainbows 🌈 oh yeah and the GESSO THAT NEEEEEVER EEEEEENNNNDSSSS!
When i went to buy a new phone case and didn't know what to choose the seller asked me "Whats ur fav color?" and i was like "RAINBOW" and he was like😶😧I bet he said in his mind what am i doing with these kids🤣
Please go back to your old intro
Love it! Cute characters great job!
Most people wouldn't get your lamb chop reference.  Me: this is the song that doesn't end. GOSH DANGIT
Love how it turned and characters you chose.
since you didn’t like the red where the gum goes maybe you paint over the clear part??
omg! that is amazing!!!!!!!! she should make a 2021 calendar with all her characters
This gives me such lisa frank vibes
wow cool ! Characters on glass are amazing !
You should make little gum ball machines for your website, it would be so cute!
Moriah: No more sound effects, I promise 5 seconds later:*sound effect*
I  n e e d  N e l s o n  m e r c h
I saw were she gave us a hint of what this weeks vid was gunna be and everyone in the comments said bubble gum machine
2030   Painting on a Window
Thank you for uploading on my 13th birthday!

I love the characters
Who thinks she should do another baking video if so copy and paste with cake emoji 🎂
how how HOW DO YOU DO IT! She is such an amazing crartist. She paints amazing draws amazing! I've only been watching her channel for 2 almost 3 years. The first video I've ever watched was her rainbow ice cream video. With the shining paint the one she said was the giant ice cream cone. Love yah 💕💕
U should read the comment I put in the community thing
It's my dream to have a gumball mishean
Claim your *here before 1M* views      Here 👇
When she did the hint I thought she was painting on gum itself- 🤣
Painting on rubber DUKYS ya plz plz plz
OMG - that sweater!!!!
bubble gum lasts so flipping long you sure are prepared for trick or treaters for a few years (yes, I know it's a long time till Halloween but as I said, gumballs last a looooong time)
I customized my own mini gum ball machine so happy to see you do one to
Can you put any type of candy in it ?
Love, love, love! New characters will soon become “famous” too!

You are amazing at drawing and painting

Fun fact: People type fun facts for likes 😉
When are you going to the Q&A?
I think the machine is ment for bigger bubble gum! 😅
i just noticed that both moriah's and draw with jazza's most recent videos mentions the "ugly phase" of a drawing.
Who else knew she was going to put a rainbow (only real moriah's fans knows XD)
1 hour ago!🤧
So I went to school and I have the mash up backpack and some kids saw NeLsOn and was just like ITS DORKKKKKKKK

Since you had dad much bubble gum can you do only 1 or 2 colors in the machine
Nobody: Not even pickle the dinosaur: Moriah: JARRING me 😳    No hate it just didn’t sound like moriah xx

If anyone read the disc- She said pisode in stead of episode  Lollllll.. love your video moriah
WE👏NEED👏AN👏ROSIE👏PLUSHY👏NOW
I live and worry for the day she gives up rainbows
Painting Rubber Ducks. Say “yes” here ⬇️
Moriah: ...in no particular order... Me: That is seriously the exact order of the rainbow!
Moriah it is not called bubble gum it's called gum balls
I LOVE it!! I can’t decide if my favorite part is the top/lid or the characters on the “bowl” it looks amazing!! Rainbow was definitely the way to go with this!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m not even going to lie I love the background changes😊
I didn’t notice her reflection in the glass until she pointed it out haha
I love Moriah when she uploads. It makes Friday's even better then they already are!
Well
YOO I HAVE THAT EXACT SAME GUMBALL MACHINE ON MY DESK LETS GOOOO
Hi
I wonder if more gumballs came out of the machine because it was meant for bigger gumballs
That was awesome! I loved this video so much! The characters combined with the gum idea was great so creative!
Hello. I don’t know what to comment soooooooo, POTATOES.
Mariah i love u ,u always make me laugh so much when I am sad u make me from sad to happy soo i love soososososososososososososososo much cause u make me laugh so hard To Mariah ❤ From ur fan❤
And I love your squishy creations so maybe you can try do another one
I’m in love with that gumball machine and HER SWEATER omg it’s so cuteeee
It'd probably be easier to blend if you used foam or a sponge. Putting the two colors ur blending on it n dabbing it like simply nailogical
Uh, "frames need analyzing. Click to analyze." My favorite detail.
Hahahahaha you get more gum when u dont put money but when u do theres less hahaha😂🤣😅
https://youtu.be/tiA-DLIuHOI honestly dont know what it is it just was in my clipboard enjoy
Quote of the year: marinating in my mind 🤣
Can we all appreciate how long she takes to film and edit her videos
Imagine balls with little toys if each character on the machine
Fun fact: *moriah said my YouTube channel name in her packing video when she was moving* :)
Omg I love it
use me as a “within an hour” button      i love this series!!!!
I love Moriah and I know she loves Rainbows and pastels and that its kind of her thing but after a while it gets old.... Id like to see her experiment with different colors and designs.
Any one Else comes on at 3:50 and waits for Moriah to post?
Damn I thought the hint was balloons
Me: Gurl you gonna put some gum in there? Moriah: ehh idk I don’t want it to ruin paint👁👄👁 I just notcited how she did put gum balls in there;-;
hii love your vids
You can put miny squishes in the gum ball machine
Oh one more thing, I just received the pickle and derp slippers and they are the softest and most comfiest slippers ever, I highly recommend u all should get them too! They’re also adorable 🥰
I have that same gumball machine :o
Moriah you are my favourite YouTuber i think of you as my sister love the video ❤️
Omg I love that sweater
Who else want her jumper sooo bad?

Wow that looks soo good and now you can have gum when you paint and  I love your  videos
You should make a Georgie family with all of your new pineapple squishies

Okay.. so.. I think this might be my favorite thrift store makeover.

I want to see moraih paint on rubber ducks

You should  make little gumball squishys!
everytime she switch's the background color i don't remember the color before it changed
Moriah got her own flash back Mary who gave her that BAD IDEA
I’m sorry I really want her jumper
Have you thought about the rubric cube
Her: time to use my gesso   Me: why don’t you just call it white paint
I’m just IN LOVE WITH IT 😍😍😍😍
Omg. By far one of my favorite videos. 😍
I love rainbow but its not cool anymore
Moriah: ok no more sound effects. Me: how dare you!
I looovvvee it 👌❤️😝
Me. Being happy that I did a good video Moriah. Not liking it  Everyone. Happy that she posted
Moriah: *turns handle without a coin and gets some gum*  Me who has had one of those gum all machines that used to have gum in it for as long as i remember: so i wasted a penny on that thing. me and my brother would just use 1 coin and then take it out of the bottom again
Today is my birthday
ARGHHHHHH IT LOOKS SO GOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Every time your felling down gurllllllll u need some moriah in your life🤗🤗
:3 :0
Who else thinks that Lucy should be rainbow cat
The only reason people watch you is because your not FUNNY🤣LOL
I know you love rainbows sooo much and it's your thing but please take a break its getting boring and samey! Maybe do clouds or suns or henna patterns or flowers or dots or stripes or cheque or bubbles or lighting ♥
Paint on bubble gum 😂😂😂 only solution!
moriah: paints nearly everything rainbow me: *l g b t q +*
Hey moriah! You may not see this but if you do I've seen people on tik tok make glass paintings where they outline a character on the glass and colour it in it, maybe you could try it out?  Edit: I think people use acrylic? Paint
the faceplate thoooough, vitrea, vitriol? from Pébéo... they have glass paints and metal paints
Amazing 🤩😁
I love your videos
nobudy wantind this
Moriah: no more sound effects  Me expecting another 1000 sound effects
I thought it was gonna be one of those tiny ones you find at dollar general
I love your videos I am sort of early normally am not I love your videos I don't know why you say alot of stuff you paint is bad but it's amazing and better than I can do
i think its a gum-ball machine not a bubblegum machine.............................
*“mAriNatin’ iN ma MiNd”*
i love your vodeos
My eyes are just happy looking at this ❤💛💚💙💜🌈
Please do more baking!!!!! ❤️
We were right!
*2nd price sticker found*   Moriah’s fingernails: it’s my time to shine and none of y’all can ruin it
I love it!
Whenever sombody paints on glass it turns out creepy
People get likes from saying something random sooo...       I have a brain tumour in my kidneys 😃👍
Make Rosie a boyfriend
We are almost 6M people who follow moriah 😣im happy 🤪😍😍✌️❤️
This is get your "I had school so I'm a little late" ticket here XD
Omg I love your vids❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 I  absolutely love them
I found out what gesso is it’s white paint with chalk ,pigments and other stuff 👁👄👁
Moriah you should’ve put bubble gum on the glass for it but I still like the design
Do you gonna do the QNA soon  (I hope QNA is the way to say it)😅 you do such a good art work🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️😅
why does she sound like beast boy from teen titans
“I want one” who agrees  👇🏻
dfghjkl;wdfghjkl;'
59 min ago  Guess I’m early
Ngl I liked it when it was its original color.. I mean if I EVER see a bubblegum machine in rainbow colors I will fucking PAINT THAT SHIT RED because red is the only color that fits it
Me in shock just now realizing that moriah is left handed 😳
Dose anyone else right in a diary ?
She has the same buble machine that I do 👁️👄👁️
I have the same gumball machine! Lol
Here’s a tip when ur taking a sticker off try to use tape I like to use duct tape.   Also who class it bubblegum it’s gumball machine
Wahhhh! It was posted an hour ago!

Interviewer: Hello I hear you are a YouTuber and I also hear you have an aesthetic what is it  Her: Well um..... I like rainbows  Interwer: How old are you again   Her: Am 26 thank you very much!

1 hour past when she made her vid  1000 comments😂
No Offence but you'd made me hate rainbow at this point-   I MEAN LIKE IT'S TOO MUCH-😭😭☹️😭😭
# BestIdeaEVER
“People??...they are not people” but what if they were??😳😳😳 lol
I think she should paint a football and put loads of her characters on it copy this so she sees
Anyone else temporarily confused by the "New frames need analyzing click analyze"
It’s so dirty
Wow I have nothing to say bc my only braincell don't work cuz SHE POST AT 1 AM IN MY CONTRY it sad really sad TvT
0:49 Don’t think she’s the only one...
I love how she refers to the bubble gum machine as a he lol
Hi moriah my name is Brooklyn and I was wondering how I can send you a package
Moriah: aww free dead skin  10 seconds ago kisses the gumball machine  My head: OMG
The elemental bubbles

Fun fact: The people who are first don't comment
Yoooooo
Omg I've missed a lot of your videos because I'm  in Disney world🙂
So cute!!
I have my own "Georgie" as a panda with a pink bow on top, sometimes I put clothes on her character. Anyways, I want to know if you (Moriah) could make her in your own style. I named my character Ming by the way.
Who also thinks she should make something dark midnight sky? Phone case? And birds plants fruits and all others
Can you do a custom rubix cube?
i haven't seen a penny since they got rid of them in Canada... pennies seem so weird to me now
You should  have made it a disk tank
I love georgie🐥❤
Moriah: ok, no more sound effects.  Also moriah: *fart noise* excuse me😏
3:21 .
sorry im late <3
Hi
Posted 1 Hour Ago😭😭😭
Yeeeeeeeeeee
You could store some of your mini squishes in there! (Not to dispense them, just because it might be cute^.^) writing this before I watch the video so my opinion may change depending on how you decorate it 🐣 - just finished and I loved how this turned out!
omg this is gonna be a good one

Hey it’s me stands for moriah Elizabeth
Ok I know you're probably not gonna see this, but I know you'll definitely do a project like this again (cause you're moriah). I suggest Mr. Super clear varnish (matte or shiny you decide) it is pretty effective for that scratching thing👍
Yeeey
Do it one a rubix cube
That sweater 🤩
10:20 kinda sounds like Moonkitti haha!😂
My name is Lucy in real life my thing says Lori because I am using my moms tablet.
No one:  Also no one:  Moriah: iT lOoKs LiKe A sCrEeChInG sOuNd      Edit: woah I got likes??????

13:18 hey u know the saying:" nothing comes free in life." (Or something like that) Well in this case it does!😄🤤🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣
When a I saw you’re story and you chewing gum I was so confused. Now it makes sense...
Yes it is like Christmas every Friday
Can You Make A GALAXY CAT PLSSSS

IT MAKES ME HAPPY THAT I HAVE THAT SAME MACHINE ( Unpainted)
Now I really want a gum Machine
The scared chickens name should be Arnold
Honestly we should not force her to paint on rubber ducks, if she has ideas for it then she will definitely do it also Moriah your shirt is the coolest thing in 2021.
Beautiful!!
I love this pisode
Hey bekah
Okay I have to comment on the "price" thing at the end as I grew up with a vintage restored one. There's supposed a plate that goes into the circular hole in the facing. Each plate has a sized slot to only accept certain denominations of coin before it lets the gear turn. In some of the newer machines, there's even double or triple slots to accept 50 or 75 cents. Without the plate, the gear can be turned freely, letting you just take the gum.
Hewo
I want to see more nelson without the fart tho but I like him 🤣
Use this as a we want Moriah to paint rubber ducks button 👍
My fav part of the week....
Moriah we need you to make the rubber duck family! Pweaseeeeee 😂❤️

Moriah : what is this mess  Everyone : its art
It turned out really cute!!❤️
You should post twice a week
Could you make a giant donut tower out of squishies please ❤️
I love how she calls it a bubble gum machine. ITS CALLED A GUMBALL MACHINE!!!
Earlyyy!!
Do a video customizing your IOS 14 with characters! I did my customs all on procreate with Ipad and an apple pencil! My instagram is ios14customs if you want some inspiration! Copy and paste if you want to see this!
I have the same gumball machine but it's on a stand
Oh my how’s my wifi was off so I didn’t know she posted a vid
AYYYY
Wow this is so cute
Omg I’m here 52 mins when it got out I’m never this early 🥳
My fave day is friday
IT LOOKS SO GOOD!! I love your videos Moriah! Hope you have a wonderful day!
Me: oh Moriah you’re painting ra- Moriah: 4:22  Me: 🤐
Isn't moriah such a queen❤💕
When ur watching moriah on her blanket in a pickle onesie with a pickle plush: im a super fan
That will look sooooo good in her room!
I’m such a big fan
OMG WE ALL GUESSED IT!!
So Moriah are you going to put rainbow I mean a random assortment of colors colored gumballs? LOL I'm laughing so hard
Moriahs jumper is perfect
Pls respond moriah🥺
You should make pupkin a plush bc it’s my FAV character he/she  is just so cuuuuuute
Moriah: I don't know that Posca's are really meant to be used on glass. Me: well I looked it up and apparently they are meant to  be used on glass.
Omg I have that same exact bubble gum thingy lol
I do think that you should have painted the part where you put the coins like white but other then that I loved it
Hold up this is possibly one of my favorite things you’ve ever done THIS IS SO HECCIN’ CUTE.
I love ya:)
I HAD TEH EXACT SAME BUBBLEGUM MACHIIIIIIIIINE
i’ve been waiting for this one
That looks awesome, rainbow is the perfect thing for something like this.
No one: Moriah: Buuuuuut, it comes with dead skin cells for freee Me: Now that what I call a dea- wait what
Why don’t you blend with a sponge? 🧽  Just asking 🤷🏻‍♀️
I think moriah should try crocheting 🧶:) like if u agree
I've got the exact same gumball machine!!!!!
When your late by 56 minutes but still “early”:    :’)
AAAAH IM EARLY!! OMG HII
heLlo
I knew it!
Hi
Moriah! Here is an idea if the red inside really starts to bother u! You could add either a thin layer of paint with a lot of gesso or lil' bit of gesso with a lot of paint it works!!
i just started watching but make it a miniature squishy despenser
Who wants to see her put the bubble gum machien and bubble gum on her website to bus because I would buy it?
Who thinks that she should do the dog in the pumpkin as a squishy, like if you agree
Wait wait wait she only has 5000 subscribers?!
Can you please try and look for a Cotton Candy machine for the next episode of this series?! Pleaaaaaaaaaaaase, Moriah!!!!!!!!!!!!
*my cousins name is Lucy :3*
I feel bad. She is a wonderful artist, but is too big of a perfectionist to enjoy it. I know she can’t control it. It makes me a bit guilty though. She is probably the only perfectionist as big as me
She said then I noticed and then an ad came up weird
I think you should you intro this year
LOL I GOT A GUM BALL MACHINE JUST LIKE THAT FOR CHRISTMAS!
who wants to see Bert turned into merch? possibly a plush? I am suggesting this because sloths are my favorite animals and they are so cuteeeee
12:32 : NeW fRaMeS nEeD  aNAlYsInG
I want bubble gum now
Moriah is litterly the funnyest person on youtube. love her sense of humor : D
I cracked up and laugh hearing her say ’’ItS THe JEssO tHaT NEveR EnDs
I feel like it’s been soooo long

My name is Lucie and I have that gum ball machine
Random stupid joke I thought of: Moriah: *Stuck in house and can’t get art supplies* *Also Moriah: Amazon, can I borrow a pencil?*

Moriah: my arm is sore  The table: LETS MAKE IT EVEN MORE >:D  0:35
50 MINS AGO!!!!!!!
Hey just a pro tip Moriah if you cover the tag in warm water for about a minute and then rub it should get rid of the price tag
I'm not trying to be one of those people but one day that could have been a LOT OF MONEY! But love what you did to it!🌈Btw love everything you do!🌈
When she said- "But then I noticed-" an add poped up and sang ''ToDaY iS gOnNa bE a GoOd DaY~'' I Laughed for a long time >D<
Put mini squishies inside of it
Moriah I love everything you make and I even got Create this Book! I love doing it and it was my dream to have it! I wish I can send you a pic of it but 1 I am 9 years old and 2 my parents would never let me.  But I just wanted to say that you are the best YouTuber and keep it up!!!

HI MORIAH
Who else likes how Moriah says gesso?
Can Moriah please do A part two to the unfixable squishy‘s PLZ
If u put mini things in that.
can you do painting on note book covers plzzzzzzzz
Its weird normal people when they hit their funny bone they scream or say it hurt but me well when I hit my funny bone I can't stop laughing for like a minute maybe more it's very weird dose anyone else do this?
The people who disliked the video probably got there hand stuck in a gumball machine or something lol.
You should paint it for decoration so when you’re hungry you can have a snack where your squishy‘s are
Yo
I’ll take the rest of the gum 😂
50 minutes ago there is so many comments 8787
I just realized she left handed after all her video! Bruh lamo smh!
Maybe when she is done painting it she can put the rubber duck in it
I KNEW IT sorry I’m I being rude.... love your vids and if you see this heart it? Or like it what’s fine to
Sorry I’m late, I was taking a nap...
Fun Fact: Now you want BuBbLeGuM

Moriah in some videos: I freaking hate this Me:um.....it.....uh.....is there a problem with because I think it’s great🤨:
Army for people thta want morality to make a new intro copy and paste to make it happen :)
you could paint the door to the ”gumhole” to hide the red
love your videos there always so fun to watch !!!
I don't know if you can find or make a bigger one but you could make a squishy dispenser for all of the Squishies that you've made. You could put the Squishies faces or bodies all over the dispenser as well.

YOUR SWEATER OMGGGGGG
Who else thinks the looks SO GOOD! 😮
OH, IT'S JUST SO CUTE!  Personally would have included painting the metal part a lighter color or even an off-white, but it doesn't take away from the artwork as a whole. I love it!
When I saw the hint I thought  She was painting on  Chewed up Bubble gum
Hi
Hello hiiiiii omg😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤🔮🧸🔮🧸🔮
She is the best
Me - clicks on this video right away because my dad gave me that exact same candy dispenser to use.
Nice
I love all of your paintings and this one is sooo god
Everyone was right
for your next video you should paint marbles and put them in the bubble gum machine
Omg I love your videos sooooooooooooooooo much I love your art
Like here if you want Moriah to paint a skate board. 👇
Cool
I’m more excited for her videos than I am for Sunday’s family meeting lunches
✨The squishy queen is back✨
Ayo heyyyy
I love it! So cute!  Your ideas are always amazing! Keep up the FANTASTIC work!
6:59 is what my parents would tell me would happen if I swallowed my gum.
It’s the gesso that never ends *he he*
I love it!The only thing that bothers me is that the area the bubblegum comes down or as you call it “The bubblegum hole”it was red and all video I was like   Me talking:DaNnnnnG dis looking good  Me realizes there is red left in it:  My mind:EEEEeeeEeeeEeee! But like your such a good painter!(im not sure you ant to be called painter or not or what I should call you-) I can’t wait for next week! C:
I’m waiting for the video where the Gesso finally is no more😬
is it just me or at 12:32 and 12:33 it says like click analyze??
It is so pretty
You need to call him Albert the 9th because I have 8 sloths all Albert so yeah plzzzzzz
Rubber Ducks Makeover PLZ
*this comment is useless, therefore shouldn’t get likes like plenty do in the 30 minutes this video has been alive*
Moriah I always look forward to your videos every Friday
I haven't watched the whole video yet so here is my idea... Fill it with your mini erasers!
Hey
Moriah: bubble bum machine  Me: isn’t it a gum ball machine  Also me later: wait there the same thing 😅😅😆😆
Who else noticed she didn't explain what Rosie was doing with the gumball?  I think Rosie WAS the gumball.
I love your personality
1 minute ago...
What if you tried to paint a gumball ?
Welp I guess I’m kinda early-
Wow you are such an amazing artist, and wish I could draw like you. 😊
Its really late for me its 9:49
I knew it was a gumball munchine though i said a squishy hahahahahaha😂
OMG Idk but its been forever thx for posting MOriah
I don't even have 1 view in 45min
Moriah I have a idea for you I think you should paint a Rubix cube like if good idea
who else has almost all her merch like if you have a least one!
Anyone else notice the frame not stabilized banner at 12:33 or is my YouTube glitching? I've never seen that before
Moriah makes Fridays special for me 😍
I am a gooey sticker.
Omg I love this it looks great 😊💕
omg please give a shoutout love you !!!  You can follow me at Steele Sisters
I know this is a very random topic but do you support lgbtq+ ....?
Moriah is my favorite youtuber with James
Will this work ?  @Moriah Elizabeth  @Moriah Elizabeth  @Moriah Elizabeth
OMG I LOVE it and I'm happy you didn't use it other designs like pickle bc this is AMAZING!!!

can we name the bored sloth Sylvester
PLZ MAKE A PAINTING ON RUBBER DUCKS SERIES   Btw I love your vids!
YOU SHOULD PUT FABRIC IN THE PLACE WHERE THE BUBBLEGUM COMED OUT
I never thought I would hear meat and artwork in the same sentence. But here I am.
I got Georgie and pickel
She doesnt know it, but she makes us smile. :3
You Should make a gaming Channel 😊
You could repaint the metal part white
Why do I have the same thing and wanted to give to her 👁👄👁
My last name is Nelson
Fans: What’s your favorite color?  Moriah: *RAINBOW*
What is the varnish that she is using?
She said "MINI" gumball machine... Um, Moriah? That's bigger then your head... and I think that counts as just a "gumball machine" lol anyways, have a blessed day <3
me being distracted hearing the first second of the m and s advert like wait omg moriah has a new intro!
😝
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!
Me sniffin youtube and finding that moriah just posted this :o Fresh cookies out of an oven!
Liked from the start. Rainbow sweater. Awesome thing to paint on.
Any one else slightly annoyed she said “Bubble Gum machine” And not Gum Ball machine?
Next thing we know she’s gonna have a piece of bubblegum every video Lol
I would buy this I would so amazing!
love your sweater!
heyyyyy
Other people: Oh Moriah uploaded Me: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YUS I HAV BEEN WAITING FOR DIS
Wow I’m one of the first ones. You won’t like my comment
Now I want to buy gumballs
Omg it’s amazing
I love you Moriah! 😁 and I really want to see a rubber ducky makeover pls
I love this
She is the best YouTuber ever
The reason the bubblegum machine gives more bubble gum than new ones is because the bubblegum machine was made to hold the big store-bought bubblegum and the pockets that dispence the bubblegum is bigger then the bubblegum you bought yourself
I have the same gum machine, cool!
Hello
Wait se is 26 what i tauout se was 20

Nobody: Literally nobody: Moriah: shames a gumball machine for not cleaning it's gumhole

I LOVE YOUR SWEATER ❤️🥰🥰😍
We all knew it!
I like your special tool😂
What time was it when you posted this?? Cus I live in sweden and it was10pm when you posted it
Woooow I was way off with my guess. I thought she was going to paint on the rubber ducks because the bubbles could’ve been like bubbles in a bath and rubber ducks belong in baths. 🛁 🦆
Moriah you should make a husband/boyfriend for Rosy/Rosie with the other dragon you were sent!
U love this tho!!!
I'm a little early :3
I love all your videos
Would rubbing alcohol or something similar work to remove the extra varnish, just to clean up the edges?
OMG HIIIIIIIIIIIII I AM ACTUALLY EARLY!!!!!!
Omg you whare right so wared
I like the original better tbh, but im glad she likes it and its not like its for me.
Omg moriagh ur awesome
Yeah I felt what it’s like to scratch if the 1st layer when your using poscas to paint on glass
Hi I Love your channel
I know u probably wont read this Moriah but I think that at some point you should definitely customize an instax polaroid camera! Like so she sees this!
No one:😐  Moriah : ✨iTs tHe GeSsO thAt NevEr eNdS✨
You could also put Pom poms in!
Omeegosh childhood memorys just came back to me.   This is the song that neverrrrr endsss it goes on and on my friendsssss
I love it its so colorful and amazing!!! <3
Omg it’s perfect!!!!! 💜
Hi
YES I FINALY GOT BACK FROM MY WALK NOW I CAN WATCH U!!
Oh ma gawd... am I actually early!?!? Ahhhhh yay! Anybody else wait for Moriah’s weekly video like their waiting for Christmas? Just me? Okay...
There is atleast one person here that watchs these videos just to see the day you run out of Gesso
lol i got a pickle hoodie but the person who ordered it got me a youth medium instead of adult medium
I WANT THAT!!!!!
Supper cute! you should make a baby name book, with all of your naming skills, when u said "Then I noticed" I had an add with people twerking with jeans on LOL
What a fabulous video
I’m lateeeee 😔
my birthday was 3 days ago i turned ten
OMG hiiii ilysm ahhh its 9:46 pm for me here but i love you!!
"That looks like a screeching sound..”              Moriah 2021
I don’t think I would notice the background change if Moriah didn’t point it out
OMG i love your videos so much and they have helped me with my dippreshon ,,, thank you :)
i fell like eating that bubblegum . :)
So early
HOLA HELLO
Interesting
to those of you wondering why she said, ‘That looked like a screeching sound”. she said that because she added the sound effect and she was basically trying to say, “that sounded like it needed a screech sound effect”
12:32???
Try minecraft
Amazing! I absolutely love it!!! Now I want one to paint!!! You rock girl! I love your videos!!!
I love her so much I painted pickle, Georgie with sprinkles, and her old 3 rainbow things(brush, jar and cupcake) on 3 drawers
“What how old am I? 26 what’s your point?”  Legit tho-
I'm soo late
On your last thrift store makeover you did rainbow
You should paint the pots that plants go in, I think that would be interesting and it might be fun! Like if you agree!
since you have so much extra you should make art using the gum maybe like the bean are you did one time
At 0:41 it looked like Grumpy Cherry Beary was standing on the gumball machine
Me seeing the finished look 😱 how much money for it???? 😂JK
i have a question i know u like rainbow buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut also its kinda ool bc LGBTQ+and im lesbiean idk if u mean to support it or not but ty!
when i saw your hint video on this i was like “it’s a gumball machine” then i saw the thumbnail “I KNEW IT”
OMG I have the same bubblegum machine but mine is smaller
Attendance for everyone who wants to see “Rubber Ducks Makeover”
12:30
You forgot a part
I sorta want to send moriah a doll that i have... its VERY creepy and it has no eyes, i wonder if she would be able to make it less creepy, but unfortunately i cant, my mom wont let me
Nobody: Moriah: *makes fun of her own clips*
Love your videos😀👍😜
OMG, SHE POSTED THIS ON MY B-DAY

Hello
My day is a thousand times brighter. ❤️
If adhd was a human:
Hey Moriah  you make my day amazing 🤩 thank you
I love u moriah ur videoa are awsome
petition for Moriah to start a collection of rocks (or something that could fit in the gum machine), and paint on it, (like maybe each character represents an item for the gum machine, and they're all bubble-gum themed?)?  edit: sorry its uh written kind of weirdly lol
how can something look like a sound?😂 love you videos and very good today as always!❤️
You should put painted rocks  in it! :D
Wow you r so creative and amazing
S

“Rubber Ducks Makeover
Hello

Lol I have the same one but smaller and not painted on ofc
U should have filled it with squishies instead of Bubble gum      Right ?
Thank you so much for two years of epic videos. Without you I wouldn't be here ❤❤
Gooey price tags should be illegal  I'm glad I'm not the only one
I’ll take the bubble gum!!
I’m sorry Maria but I have to dislike I love the video I would like but the dislikes is an uneven number and I have to make it even Like it’s 110 I have to dislike just to make it 111

You are so talented love you 😘
💜💜💜👀🎉
If there are cobwebs, then where are the spiders?
When I first started this video I was like eh wold I like this, but it was GREAT!
Boo
If u ever have to remove a sticky price tag, you can use a hair blow dryer and blow it on the tag for a little. Then it peals off really easily
Omg hiii
Totally it does feel Like Christmas when she posts
Nervous nelson ❣️

Can we just take a momment for Moriah's amazing sweater :O
I love what you did with it ❤️
So cuteeee
Omg I have that exact bubble gum machine. I painted on mine too, I drew light pink and blue bubbles on it with I violet background.
She keeps calling the machine a he and all I can think about it the gum ball machine from regular show
OKAY NILLA,THE SQUISHY YOU PAINTED LOOKS AND HAS THE SAME NAME AS MY GUINEA PIG AND NELSON THE WIERD GREEN GUY HAS MY LAST NAME......moriah can you explain.....
Hello
Moriah needs goo gone
My cats name is Rosie
Did anyone noticed the fact that the inside where it dispenses the bubblegum is still red🤨👌🏻
Maybe take some jewelry/metal cleaning/buffing stuff to at some point clean up the metal plate in the front :o Just an idea for a side thing to do to make it really pop more. I wouldn't say something that needs to be filmed LOL Just a possible thing to keep you busy if in a cleaning or tidying mood. Idk just a suggestion though :D Love how the gum machine turned out!!
I love your videos so much Moriah❤️❤️
First ad I got was your candy crush add and thought this video was sponsored by candy crush again, till my distracted self noticed I was just an idiot and that it was just an ad.
Where did you get your jumper I love it? (Jumper is English for sweater)
OMG I'M EARLY
U know what we need-more opi or opi cam
Love your sweater
#pickle
Like everyone was saying gum ball machine
I think Bert's name should be Carl.
*inserts dustin and susie from stranger things singing never-ending gesso* :)
Maybe you don’t have to paint the inside where the red is, maybe you could glue fabric in there to change the color??
As soon as i saw the gumball machine i thought of pastel pink/purple clouds around the bottom of the glass (like how people do in the mirror painting trend). And on the red part have unicorns, rainbows, etc.
3:50 me: realizes that she is painting pastel rainbow -claps-
I LOVE IT
Do a rubber ducks painting vid
I thought she was gonna paint on a balloon I'm so stupid 😭🤣
hey its MEEEE
9:55 we all can’t be winners.  I think the phrase you are looking for is we CANT ALL be winners 😂
me: watching gacha          also me: sees vid 30 mins ago     🥰😍😁😆😄😅😃😀  the vid i was watching before hand: i wont do it i just thanking about it  me again:clicks on new vid   my mind:i did it
My grandma has the exact same gum ball machine.
That is so good. I love it!
My grandma has the same gumball machine
If the red on the inside really bothers you. Putting something else in there can always ben an option, like a piece of fabric, foam, plastic, paper that you painted with plastic wrap around it, or even something else to cover the red without being permanent. This also makes for easy cleaning and repairs to that area.
I KNEW IT THAT IS A GUMBALL MACHIAN
Dang it only been 41 minutes and this video already have 26k like 8.1k comment
Omg i love it soooooo much!! Me and my friend, Cali, love You soooooooooo much Moriah!!!!!!!! Bye!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Hi
Ok can we just talk about her shirt!😍❤️😍
The bubble gum machine is adorable and so much more her style!
Does anyone else think she should have a museum full of the weird stuff she paints?
Wait she ordered 7 bags of bubble gum and there’s a saying that if you swallow gum it won’t come out for seven year o:
I LOVE YOUUUU
I want her to do more baking videos
I really want bubble gum now
8:27 thats my name
I know that it is filled with bubblegum right now but maybe at one stage u could put little mini squishies in at and at the end of either every squishy makeover video or every few squishy makeover videos u could spin it and whichever one comes at u paint as an extra I think it would be fun :)
Sooooo Nice!!!🍬🍭🍬🍭🍬🍭🍬
I NEED this in my life.  Shut up and take my money!
plz .... paint rubber ducks or Georgie will have no family🥺  Lysm moriah ❤️✨
SO UNPROFESSIONAL WHO IS SHE TAKING TO ❔❔❔❓
Fun fact: the whole comment section is full of “fun fact:” and “- Moriah Elizabeth 2021”
U ARE AMAZING
This looked super cute! Please fo more of these type videos!💚
Suggestion to name the scared chicken "Frederic"
My ex friend got me a very similar gumball machine so now I have no idea what to do with it This has almost nothing to do with the video But the improved gumball machine is very nice Moriah :)
Yay I am so glad she is doing more thrift store makeover I love this series

This is the most random purchase ever, but still, somehow I'm not surprised you bought this xD also, watching clips from your older videos is like watching vines to me now: I know all of them and just wait to see my favs again xD
Ironic
My power just went out so this is the only video I can watch and I’m fine with it!
R.I.P to the elbow that hit the table trying to look at the machine xP
I loved that one where you put ur charictors on the playing cards please do that again 🙏😉
I would ma e designed a face on the glass and he has an open mouth and his tounge rolls down to the gum hole (not on the glass cap)
I have the same gym ball machine but smaller
AWWWWW ITS SOOOO CUTEEEEEEE 😍😍😍😍😍😍 i love how you draw  the bored  sloth 💖😍💟 he looks like he's a babyyyyyy😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

I love Moriah any one else
I looked at the thumbnail and knew something looked familiar! When I was around 10, I got that exact gumball machine for christmas-
“Ok, no more sound effects.” **plays sound effect**
“This is great!”   *moriah seconds later*  “OW!”
Hello
I LOVE THE SLOTH ITS MY FAVO CARCTER FROM WHEN HE WAS BORN
I love it!!!!
I saw one of those old fashion gumball machines in the thrift store the other day and some lady snatched it before me🤣🤣🤣
I probably made the biggest 'gasp' noise when I saw this in my recommended.
I knew it was a bubble gum machine when she blue a piece of gum🍬🍬
This is weird because she say she gona make a squishy🤨 but still this is a beautiful video❤
Plz
She just makes me laugh and makes my day better
10:19 am I productively doing homework while watching this video?
40 Minutes late how about you
Panda
Stop it get some help. Stop using rainbows  🌈🌈🌈
This is just what she needed. Her very own gumball machine.... NO!    She needs to fill is with costume gumball squishies like if you agree.
It turned out awsome!!!!! I love it
No one : Me : Goes to Amazon and orders a Bubble Gum Machine Also me : "I am going to order just gonna order 3 bags of bubble gum.  Make that 7
e
its 5 am and i havent slept but im accidentally early so its ok 😌
remember to do an Easter squishy before Easter
Hi I’m earlyish
Hi moriah!
Hiiìiiii
I was so happy when see was painting a gumball machine cause that was what I had guessed
i’m sorry for anyone playing but....... I lost the game. Don’t come to kill me 💀
This made me want to go out and buy a bubblegum machine
I like the thought of a “bubble gum” machine instead of a gumball machine. Like chewed up wads of gum shooting out at your face 😁
“That was jaring “ ( just before 5:05
Omg I love your videos and I am such a huge fan. Plz never stop posting because you made Friday my favorite day of the week just to watch your video!!
You know what bugs me is the iron or metal part that you put the money into and twist the lever will it bugs me that its so plain it looks out of place. But it still looks TOTALLY AMAZING.
Live videos
Hvo wants Moriah to paint rubbur ducks 👍 if you agree

“Don’t ask about it you wouldn’t understand.” Literally me being my lazy self😂🤣😅
I love it how she just attempts to kiss the bubble gum machine
Hey Moriah okay let's be real this was a really boring video and it was the boring rainbow it looked off but I thought it was a really cool object but it was a boring video still sorry

It goes on and on my friendssssss
If you don't want to paint the Gumdrop slot you could use vinyl to mask the red color.
Everyone: "That just looked like a screeching sound” -Moriah 2021,  Me: Happily watches the video  Edit: Do I really have 96 likes? Or is it just a glitch for me?
Early ! Yayayayayyayayayayay
Is it just me or it the top red thing an undercover plunger who doesn't fit in at the bathroom...
I can’t wait for the 2021 squishy rating, it’s gonna look so cool with all of her new characters
Y not pickle
I love it so much at first I was like ew this isn’t gonna be good but it was like so good
I love how she just said: You know what- OwWwWwWw - then continued like nothing happened.
This is gonna be really gross but the "booger" looked kinda hairy 👀😅
Go me(mora elizabith
Aaah
I'm early! Can I have a shoutout?
Omggg I luv it
we need the rubber duckieeeeeeeeesssssss
Me “I’m so good at art” Moriah “ my human  drawings are horrible” when they’re actually amazing✨
You should put white or black bubble gum in there so the drawings really pop!
7:10 oh, nice
You should do a bag with pickle and the others Squishy’s
No wonder she did the bubble gum machine! The bubblegum is in all rainbow colors! Haha! 🌈
Oh my god, your sweater... where did you get it??? I LOVE IT SO MUCH

Omg I love the bubble gum machine. Where can I find one like this. I want one no not want I NEED one.😝
Moriah lets be real this wasn't a fun video it was a cool item you picked but I think the rainbow looked a little off so can you try a little better next time I'm sorry to say this but this is how I really feel about this video I'm sorry
It's a piggy bank!!!!!
everyone ship it- Moriachine  Which is Moriah and gumball MACHINE
May I mention that Moriah puts her ‘e’ in her name as a lower case. Surely  she would probably think about that is she saw this comment but we don’t talk about that.
my past few days have been horrible. I have a lot going on at home but moriahs videos makes me feel so much better. Thank you for being amazing and making videos that make my day ❤️❤️❤️
Ok...37minutes? Not bad! Love your videos Moriah!
Omg it's so pretty!!! I love it so much! The characters are adorable on the glass tooo!
wait WAIT SINCE WHEN DID U TURN 26 WHENS YOUR BIRTHDAY :0000
Is it “bubble gum machine “ or “gum ball machine” who knows
Loved this! I would love my own customized gumball machine now...
Oh my gosh he sweater is soo pretty!!! 🌈
I love this series! You truly have amazing talent!
This was literally the best outcome ever and fulfilled my rainbow needs 🌈😍🤤
“Gooey price stickers should be illegal”                                                                         — Moriah Elizabeth 2021
I discovered  your chanel two days ago, totaly randomly, and I couldn't STOP watching you since. I was still watching them when this one got released ! You are my new obsession, you're amazingly funny, and I just wanted to send you all my love and let you know that you have a fan in france ! Amour du love for you !!!!
I LOVE THIS
Please do a Q+A!!!!!
Moriah: says SoRrY for acting weird   One second later: *SCREEEEEEEEECH*
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Video idea-  Put coloured balls in there and small things that can represent acrylic, water colour and so on   Then roll the gumballs out of the machine and whatever you get you have to use to make    ™aArTt( art)
Hi sorry I'm late
Pickle!!!!
I love this vid and I just realized I'm EARLY btw I'm NEVER early
The green Monster name was fred i think
Ik, Not time for maths but  you would actually have 4 and a half bags left because 7 - 2.5 is 4.5😁👍
You put the characters bubbles in rainbow order       Sneaky
My fav YouTuber: My fams fav YouTuber: Ilysm moriah! I got the pickle plushie a few months ago! And the hoodie and I was soooooo happyyy!
We guessed it with your bubblegum hint! :))
Hey my friend named a ghost Bert. Like, last night. At midnight. Like a crazy person.
“In no particular order”....Yeah...Of course...Moriah we all know...🙃
3:21 This is the song that never ends..  🎶
who else would buy this-
Moriah: Mabye i shode do someting new on this machine, *mabye rainbow* thats a good idea. Me: moriah that is not new you use rainbow like evrry single te but... I still love it ❤️
OMG i love it!!!!!
you make me laugh every Friday
to be honest, is anyone REALLY surprised that she painted it rainbow. who would've known LOL
If I had a penny for how many times she has been weird I would be the richest person on earth (if I had a penny for how many times I've been weird I would be richer than I would be for how many times Mariah has been weird)
She is so unique and creative
Just a tip for faster gradients, sponges. Cover half and half with the paint colors and dab back and forth and up and down enough to blend it out. Will take wayyyyy less time than a brush
do u do shouts outs?
I LOVE this I want itttt
OMG I knew it LOL❤️
I can't wait to fix up my thrifted bubble gum machine.
my back hurts
I thought I was early, she posted 36 minutes ago..... there are already 7.7 THOUSAND COMMENTS
i love the chick .lol
I don’t know why but I love when you say gesso and varnish
You should make a buble gum themed squishy to seat in it
You should add mini squishies into it and  whatever comes out you should paint 💕🥺
Pickle!!!!
That bowl looks like a fish bowl kinda LOL
Mariah I just half to say thank you. You are the reason I got back into painting. You even inspired me to start painting on sea shells
hiiiiii!
mE WaNtS tO tRaCe -Moriah 2021
Squishy machine  First what letter you start with your in = your squishy   A-H: cake  I-p: dog Q-z: sloth  Ok now to decide what scent they get we will use your age   1-5 chocolate  6-11 raspberry  12 and up sweet  Now for what paint we use is based on how much you love Moriah  ☺️:puffy paint    🙂: fabric paint  🤨: normal paint I got a dog scent raspberry with puffy paint
Every week:  HEY its me
Loveeee this makeover!❤️  Anyone else waiting for her to customize a deck of cards?👀
Jesus loves you all no matter what Jesus Christ is king my savior my everything
Early! ;w; I’m never early
Moriah: But then I noticed... Random commercial: I'v been alive for a while now!
Yesss! I love your videos SO MUCH!
No, thank you so much for posting😊
Love it 🌸
I want gum now :p
Yay I’m early for once!
Oh my god this is so awesome!!!!!
Nice explanation about how to use a gumball machine I don't think I'd know how is you didn't
im early also i love your art
Moriah: doing price stickers should be illegal! Me: I agree they should do price tags instead
#33minuteslateclub
Wow 3 pices of gum for free XD
Gum hole a whole in your gum would really hirt
Please draw Nelson more often. I like him.
Me: I’m early :D The comments: no ❤️
When putting it together you have to make sure that the inside gray wheel does not allow bubble gum through when turning it without money!
I love it. Also I think I know how to fix the red gum hole problem. You could have painted over the clear cover so you don’t see the red. I’m sure it wouldn’t look super weird, plus I’m sure it’s be more fun not knowing how much gum you got. Just a little suggestion 💖
It's the gesso which never ends........me 😐
WTF
Yay your back!!!! Welcome home! 😇
You make my day 😀
PANTA ON A NATEND SWICH
Not me watching this video in Moriahs merch sweatshirt on my phone with her macacake phone case 👀

I have this omg
I was explaning who you were to my parents and i said shes a 26 year old that has a personality as a 11 year old i had no idea how old you were-
You should have put Nilla as one of the characters! ❤️🐶🍩
No one : Mariah : squeezes 50 times more varnish than needed 😂😂😂
My schools name is literally Nelson lol

26?!?!? YOU DO NOT LOKK LIKE 26!!!  YOU LOOK LIKE 21!!!!!! You have always looked young to me, and ALWAYS will😊!!!!!

I’m so happy I am finally done with all my work so I can catch up and finally be early!
Anyone else notice that the place where the bubble gum comes out is red meanwhile there is green blue and purple surronding it?
I LOVE YOUR VIDS SO MUCH I only wish you the best😁😁
The black plate is annoying me...I think it needs to be rainbow too🤪
Thanks Moriah for posting videos! You are such a big inspiration to me. Right after I started watching you, I have been really enjoying painting! Also loved the bubblegum machine!
Been Waiting for this one               *Turn it up!*
Mariah: I really like how much personality all the characters add to it,  The bored sloth: *Ahem*
My friend got me watching this a month ago and now I can’t stop watching this it is creative and funny I love you and thank you for making these videos because you did not have to

I love her sweater so much! I wish I had one 🥲
On Today's Episode, what item will Moriah paint fruit /food/animals on in pastels?!?!?! 😂 🐥🐰🦖🍩🍉🍊🍒🍓🍔 ❤️👀👀👀👀
Imagine if she had made fake gumballs with faces on them—
12:31 (Wondering if that blue line was meant to be there?)
Is it just me or did it trigger anyone else the amount of times she said ‘bubblegum’ many, many times. Maybe it’s just bc I call them gumballs 😂
You are such a good artist
I love youre comment if you do to
Who else just set here and wait for her to do a vid 👁👄👁
Moriah: I'm going to make the top hat creating the same rainb- I meAn RanDomlY ColoRFul GRaDIenT Me: yeAH, RanDoMlY ColOrFuL GrAdIeNT HEhhehE
Moriah:Scrreeeeee Me: mmmh that was a weird sound.
no you have 4,5 bags of gum 😂😂😂 7-2,5=4,5
Every friday is like Christmas because Moriah posts  Edit: ty all so much for the likes  Moriah I’m famous 💛
*yuh*
I was just wondering if you could do your own squishy range on your merch and some pins of characters
I can't wait for your next videos
Hi, have a nice day/night
Me: "oh she'll just google what paints work on glass" Moriah: "IDK if posca's work on glass, but they do today" Me: "oh, great..."

Mariah clearly has magical gesso because my mom is out of gesso and she's only had it for about a month and I'm pretty sure Mariah has had that for like maybe three months or more
i guessed it!!!
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Moriah never makes ugly designs and that's on periodttt
The memes in the videos make it so much ✨B E T T E R✨
I think the reason it gives out two or three pieces of gum because your gumballs are a little bit smaller than normal
Yay! Im kinda early? And this is my favorite episode yet!! 😁
Im 30 minutes late but i hope yousee this moriah i have watched your videos for so long. Also the end product was SO CUTE!

US: When in doubt draw it out Moriah: When in doubt, "Pask pens"
Moriah: "Marinating in my mind" Me: " Marinating? What u said about Among us?!" 😎😂  I love this creation btw, looks amazing! Even more with the characters on the glass, I wasn't sure if that's a good idea or will be too much... But the black Outline and keeping it simple Cartoonish made it perfect!
Me ohh, She posted Me 10 secends later laughing my head off

3:21 aahhhhh
Love you
OH DANG SHES 26 I THIUGHT SHE WAS 20 OR SOMETHING. o,o
Eeeeee omg I’m im early
Ok so she literally makes my day better.  Literally tho. Moriah: it looks like a ScrEeChInG sound
I haven’t two idols...          they are opie and moriah
You are literally the best artist I watch!
Omggg I love it I guessed it tooo as soon I saw this notification I freaked out my sister was like what you do excited for
Vid idea: Painting a rubies cube🌟
I swear you make everyone's day better- 💖💖💖
I love that bubble gum machine
You are amazing and creative
Sorry late
Her: His name is  Me: simpsons? O.o
Y’all..... Moriah spent $132.93 on gum balls and used $47.48 of that to fill it only once. Just thought I needed to put that out there.
I love your videos u are so great and intertaining
Me when I see the thumbnail: YES. YES. YES.  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
Just me who just realised after abt 2 years on Fridays at 9 that Moriah is left handed!
I want it 🙂
You should do that stress ball thing you showed in your you actually showed sone fish net leggings idk xD the video is named “wanna pack with me” or what is was xD // ps i love your vids💕
Honestly if she hadn’t pointed out the background changes I totally wouldn’t have noticed
Looks amazing! I love it 💖
Am I the only one who finds moriah so so pretty ?
hiiiiiii PLSSSSSSSS BAKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MORIAHHHHHHHHH I AM CRYING
Popular opinion: Everybody wants a friend like Moriah
10:53 wait what?!?!?? I thought it was a random gradient of colors???
I like when she pulls clip from previous videos. It gives me flash backs and add a valuable touch.
It looks amazing woah!
Anyone else slightly bother that’s surprised chicken is sideways.... I mean the bubble is supposed to be lifting him up... unless there’s wind.....maybe that’s why it’s to the side...
Moriah just makes Fridays so much better. They’re so boring in quarantine. They’re not special anymore. Especially since after online school the first thing I think is “Monday tomorrow UGH” just to realise tomorrow is Saturday YAY. But seriously, you make Fridays so much better, you give us something worth waiting for.
Me trying to think of a comment XD

How many people predicted that this was gonna be bubblegum machine   👇
what normal people draw/paint on: paper and phone cases what elizabeth paints: BuBbLe gUm mAcHinE  🤣💖💖💖💖💖
i think the machine is meant for bigger bits of gum which is why more came out
Collect your here before viral ticket all you do is like 👍
As soon as i saw it i looked up and saw mine.
Does anyone not realize she changed the background color until she mentions it?
No joke right now I am in bed watching moriah Elizabeth cuddling with cousin derp, pickle and gorgie with my moriah Elizabeth blanket
Me : thinks I’m early The comment section: 7k comments  Me: huh
Mariah I love every thing you do and I wish I had your talent of ART
Just because I'm not a fan of bubble gum, I think I would have filled it with larger pom poms.
Hello I LOVE your vids Mariah I think you should paint a Barbie house!!!
Love it Moriah awesome job!!

I love how it turned out!
Omg you should take the bubblegum out and put all the video ideas you’ve been meaning to do on a piece of paper and it’ll come out random and that’s what you’ll do that week
I love it 😚
On glass, you can always trace around your critters with a exacto blade and peel the overage of varnish.
I lovee how Moriah is so creative and just paints on anything and how she tries out different things in every video. Love you Moriah❤❤
Omg hi i am early I am a girl and my name is kushiena narine and I am 11 years old and I have bin watching you since 2017 I love u so much I am going to meet u I really love u 😍😍😘😘😘😘 and I hope u had a great day

I love your gumball machine it looks great love every painting you do!
bruh it's farting out more than one bubblegum because the machine was designed to use larger bubblegum

Moriah: "His names been Nelson the whole time you just didn't know it."   Me: "Maya Nelson, Simon Nelson and Penny Nelson."   These names are the 3 main characters names in book series. Theres 3 books. Who knows the series I'm talking about?
Who else agrees Moriah did an AMAZING job, and deserves all the hype she gets every episode? I know it isn't just me.
Already luv it and I haven’t seen beyond 5mins! Luv ur vids 🥰
i LOVE that rainbow sweater
Yass  thrift store makeover is my favorite
OMG the results 😍😍😍😍

Wow give me it is beautiful 😍
Oh just me watching on multiple devices to help moriahs  channel (not that she really needs it just to give more views)
maybe the machine is supposed to be filled with those larger gums so I doesn't fall more than 1 per use
Moriah you always make my day better when I’m upset and you are such a talented artist 🥰😊
Yea I guessed it YES
Im wondering does anyone else come over here after an intense dreamsmp stream?
7:02 I am dying 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like it
I love how cute this turned out!!
“That just looked like a screeching sound” -Moriah 2021
I am so glad she posts on fridays because it makes them even better!!
I love your videos
Moriah should be in a turbo tax free commercial.

I knew you were painting the Gumball machine from the pool you put up ⬆️ . When you blew bubble With gum
Me on Fridays: Omg it’s that time again! Funny, entertaining, awesome, perfect person posts her wonderful, inspiring, funny, awesome videos!
Moriah your great I watch you every week and your hilarious but I am so tired of the rainbow every week they all look the same. Maybe for a video you should try something different or try different styles. Again I really like you I’m just sick of the same design on every piece.
Early and I guessed it!
A GUMBALL MACHINEEE
I love this sloth
SO CUTEEEEE!
I saw your Instagram and I thought you were gonna paint a paint pallets again XS
Maybe she can paint little balls or something like that with mini characters on them and put them in omg
“in other words... *me wants to trace.* ”
Enamel paint is best for glass
Moriah explaining how the gum ball machine works😂😂😂😂
I love that she makes memes out of what she has done if that’s how I saythat
0:35 why does it look like she is stuck between her table sandwich and is getting sqeezed??

Hi Moriah! I really like you'r videos and I wanted to thank you for inspiring me to recreating my old things. Ówò (Please don't mind my bad grammar I'm spanish únù)
Question for q&a what was your childhood like
Your videos are one of the only things I have to look forward to at the moment - they never disapoint!! Thank you moriah 💖💞
👋
“I haven’t even tested if it works yet...paint first, test later.” LOL why is this literally me.

Wait but this is just beautiful.
5:25 it isn’t a moriah video without sound effects
Moriah: "gooy price-stickers should be illigal."   no one: ...   not a living soul: ...   my dumb self: That is the truest words ever spoken by any human being EVER.
Love you moriha
I have Georgie plush
FINALY
Why does the silver look better after the sides were painted rainbow. I guess it’s just proof that everything’s better with rainbow

Me: I’m earlyish, I should comment Me: but what? My unconsciousness: this
Has Moriah ever tried to blend the colors with a sponge? 🤔 i always feel like it's easier and less time consuming. 🤗🌈
First of all! $19 for a bag of gumballs is LUDICROUS! Second of all! You spent OVER, $135 on... GUM! Nice makeover tho! 😉
You should do a Q&A                                                              Anyone agree?  ⬇️

I was just watching one of Moriah 's other videos when I got the notification for this videos and was like " What it's Friday?" Normally I stare at my subscription page every Friday  refreshing the page over and over
20:58 rainbow Her 4 minutes earlier random colours not rainbow   Everyone else am I a joke to you

I know this is probaly a bad idea but you should try painting on a mouse pad and maybe a mouse so it will be yours only and very unique! Sorry for the bad spelling and love your channel !<3
Fridays are so much better with your videos to see and look forward to!!
am i the only  one that saw the spelling mistake in the bio?   let me guess you went to the bio to look

Hi moriah
Hi
I love her videos she just gives me so much inspiration. She is the one who got me started on painting on things I find in thrift stores and random things I find around my room lol
Yesh! I correctly guessed what she was going to paint.
When will she have nothing left to paint? Nobody knows
I love it so so much! I just wish you made the metal plate shine more. It looks a little dark/dirty compared to the random stripes of color and characters.
You are so amazing! I can’t stop watching you!!!!
I'm rarely ever this early
I love you sooo much

“boy you have a dirty gum hole”        -Moriah 2021
How come I never realize when the background changes?
Amazing! love U Moriah ❤️❤️
oooo IM kinda early for the third time in a row
Hello Moriah! I am new here and I love your videos. You are my favorite YouTuber because your channel is so unique. I love how you edit your video’s, It just makes me smile every day. I hope you see this comment, have a great day!   PS. This may look sloppy because I am very young. 😅
Tip: Have a sheet of paper to write down the colour of the previous background :) xx
One word       ⚡A W E S O M E ⚡
It isn't a moriah video without a video clip of the traumatic cupcake experience
You made my day better of being sick (yes im sick)
omg so cute!!!! oh ya and that gum u have gimme gimme I love gum XD
When will she have nothing left to paint? Nobody knows
You should do a slightly different bake with me but making something to go inside it   Once  you finnish the 5 and a half bags of gum u have
The dispenser is not that small!
The new version is soooo much better! :D like if u agree
The question of the century: bubblegum or gumball?
Moriah:posts   Me:I am going to drop everything and whatch.     Thank you for the content I am a big fan
Bro my mom got the same one like tree says ago and there was two of them but we only got one😳
looks so cool and can i have one gum lol
who else wants her to make custom coins to go in there
I’m going to take a wild guess and assume it’s going to be a rainbow design...
This is how many memes Mariah has of herself ⬇️
Mariah is one of my favorite yotubers
I really love your videoss❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤍
What 2018 needed: pickle the dinosaur. What  2019 needed: Ustace and Shelly What 2020 needed: Georgie and cousin derp                                                               What 2021 needs: Bumblebear squishy!

End result is so perfect

5:00 - 5:03 who actually noticed the background change (not me)
I wanted colorful eyeballs in the machine. But that is just my style.
Im glad she’s posting weekly again
She should use that for a plusie
Can I have a shout out is what I meant to say
My daughter (who's six) and I were watching this video after a rough day of online learning. She nearly exploded with happiness when you called S'more Cat Lucy .

FINALLY MADE IT!!
It's the cutest thing ever but the black big thing was disturbing me😥
When you gave us the clue of a bubblegum bubble I certainly wasn’t expecting this-
*An alternate idea*: you paint a simplistic, yet cute gum ball machine and paint your individual characters on the gum balls
Hii am such a big fan and I have been watching you for years you are the one that inspires me everyday :)
Moriah always makes me laugh 😂
Can we all rage at Moriah for not saying puffy paint and she says puppy paint
I love it
Your work is awesome but I think you should come out of your comfort zone and try other variety of colours ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎 (not only rainbows)
baking vid next? Love your vids! <3

Moriah, I Mabey think if you want to do this off cam or whatever works for you IF u want to do it, you could paint that little vines on the metal part where you turn the knob and it might add more re to your aesthetic and I think it would be cool!!! Just suggesting!! You did an amazing job! ❤️❤️❤️ Byeeee!!❤️💛💚💙💜💖😘

I’m an OG viewer!
I wonder what would happen if you put miniture  squishes in the gumball machine
Is it just me or i have feeling Nelson was orange/yellow in the past... Could this ne Mandela effect
Finally its friday
When you do Squishy Makeovers instead of picking out of a container randomly, up all of your small squishes into a small ball and put it into the gumball machine! Like if you agree. Also, I love how Moriah Elizabeth talks to us like we're her friends.
Who else thought she was gonna do a Q &A
That is definitely the best thrift store makeover ever!
2:30 that a better sound then a chuck board sounds like! Kinda like a beautiful Dolphin 🐬 Laughing 😎
Moriah: Painting a gum ball machine and being productive with her life   Me: Sitting on my phone
I love it so much your art just makes my day better!
I just noticed that it was Friday (Lockdown got me missing days 😅) and was like *Moriah posts on Friday's. Now I have happiness*
MORIAH, WHAT ABOUT THE WATERMELON CATERPILLAR? Also, try using Tempera paint for glass
Aw so cute Me❤️

NELSON 💨
This is how many people want Moriah to make Georgie a girlfriend.  👇
Hi moraih
i think you should also paint the grey part on the front..... loved the makeover btw🌸🥰
Video idea: nerdecrafter does squishy makeovers and you do squishy unmakeovers
Me: Hmm I wonder what color she will paint it?  Her: RAINBOW  Me: I should have known
I wonder if you could mod podge fabric over that red area on the inside? That way the paint wouldn't chip. But either way, super cute!!
Early
today was the worst day ever because my dog died
Y e s.
you could have done pickle blowing a bubble with all of your other characters inside of it.  But i still like what you have done
In your next video can you please paint the bear squishy but instead of the cake turn it and to Honey jar 🐻🍯🍯🍯🐻
how manyyyy
I looooooove Rosie she is adorable❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I just love the WHOLE bubblegum machine!!!!!❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️
Alright I'm going to try not to comment on M.E's video right after I see it . . . OH WAIT
I love it so cute but if you want out of bubblegum you can  stalker it with all  those bags of gum lol
Can you make a video where you paint stuff u can put in it? Maybe marbles of plastic that you paint on, not something complicated just basic?
Me being broad not no more. these are every fun to watch
More bake with ME!!
Yes
The machine is beautiful, i love the idea of painting on the glass 10/10
Moriah: you dont wanna pop that bubble whas that im 26 whats your point? me: laughs then go silent and realises...

Pls do a painting on paint pallets
I love this and I'm so happy to see the scared chicken again. He is awesome.
Hi moria your so creative and you can keep painting those Panda buns
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE EVERY SINGLE PERSON TO EVER EXIST EVER FREAKIN NEEDS ONE OF THESE
Moriah, I have an idea for that bubble gum machine you could do. Once you decorated it, as you decorate small squishies you can fill up the bubble gum machine and use it as decoration.  like if you think it is a good idea.
I knew it
*gum*
I think this is my favorite piece on which you have painted an arrangement of colors in no particular order.
nobody Moriah "its the jesso that never endsss"
I am just waiting for the day where she runs out gesso
I love seeing the less used characters!
Let’s just face the fact we wish Morizah  could teach us how to art
When in doubt wip the pacas out.
This is how many time Moriah uses rainbow color schemes   |   |   | 🔻
I'm really not into art, but I love to watch Moriah’s video.
Moriah: just painting the colors in no particular order  Me : whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa omg that’s a first and probably the lasy
I loveeeee it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
How many of you would like to meet Moriah, by the way Moriah you are amazing 🤩  👇
Me: look at the vid and I am bad painter.  2 hours later......  Me: Trying to paint a master piece.  What have I done...
That is so cool!!!
I love moriah Elisabeth
Me so excited to watch the video and now it’s over happy gum ballz
i LOVE this!!!!!!!!
I think it’s gumball machine
I love it 🥰
I want to do this but have no ✨talent✨

I wish she painted the grey thing
Awww it’s so cute all your characters I love the cartoon design and I think the bubble machine turned out amazing!!!
Let me see if I can trick you...   Read more
I dare you to put this video on the slowest playback speed                   😂
10 things i hate: 1. like beggars 2. people who can't count 3. badd speling 4. people who repeat themselves 5. emojis 6. people who repeat themselves  like if you agree 😹👿
DANG IT SCHOOL MADE ME LATE!!!
OMG I LOVE IT I NEVER EVER ONCE SAW YOU PAINT THOSE Character  Edit thankyou for the one like
B e a u t i f u l. Ive been watching you for a year now, and Ive never been disappointed, each video is just as amazingly inspiring as the last
Can u make a diy puzzle in a art things to do when ur bored
Moriah should do a “painting a Rubik’s cube” video where she paints one of her characters on each side copy paste it to make it happen!
YESSS! I'm earlyyy ILY moriah
Hi
You should add one off your rainbow pompoms on top
Now I’m craving bubble gum lol 😂
Moriah: how am i? 26 Me: how u look 19
Uhhhh idk wat to comment
POV:noone has watched this whole video yet
You could paint the clear plastic top part so that you dont see the red behind it when its there. Youll know when the bubblegum comes out cus than you can hear it!! <3
Hi Moriah,🥺❤️ So I haven’t watched the video yet..but I can already tell it’s gonna be interesting and cool. I just wanted to say that you have just inspired me so so much, and I love you very dearly. Me and my two best friends got into a major fight..so I’m kinda down in the dumps. We decided not to to talk to each other for a short amount of time and your videos are just such a help. I love your sarcasm and humor. And I couldn’t imagine what I would do without you..But just in case you see this, just know that I love you, and NEVER think that people don’t love you because we really do. Don’t listen to the haters and just do what makes you happy. You shouldn’t be forced into anything you do and make content that you actually want to see on your channel. We all love and support you.. Love,   G.
I LOVE how colorful it is!!!!
Wow it turned out sooo cool😍🥰🌸really like it
I loved that so much! Bubble gum machine what a great thrifted item to customize!
I honestly think this is the best thrift makeover (yet)! It’s so colorful and just great, featuring some of my personal favorite characters of hers! Can we just appreciate that Moriah always makes our Friday better?😏😁
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes
I love it so much!! It’s so amazing how you turn a piece of trash into a piece of love and beauty❤️❤️❤️❤️

Warly
Hi my name is Jenna and I have been watching you since I was 5... I am 9. I love your videos! Video Idea: Art supplies asmr?!?! Idk if it is a good idea?
Lol now I’m in the mood for bubble gum 🍬
I am your biggest fan ever
IM EARLY!!
Idk what to say sooo uh pretend this is funny
Can you please post at least 2 times a week I'm a huge fan and I love your videos so much and have been watching for a very long time and I want to see more 😄
Ok I like georgie buuut i just started watching and I am liking it...OMG I JUST WATCHED THE VIDEO ITS SOOO COOOL
Fun fact :I just realized that I should watch all Moriah's with earphones in
stay tuned sports fans
Moriah: So unprofessional! Also Moriah: He'S fArTiNg BuBbLe GuM.
I'm definetly about to go and buy a gumball machine to paint😂
I love the thrift store makeover. Please do more of them
Graveyard loon made pickle out of felt it’s a character
thats so pretty
I love your jumper!:O
Pls make a cooking video
I love her work! She is so funny and always makes me happy 😋
Who thinks she should do my Instagram followers choose my squishy make over?
Roses Are Red ❤️ Violets are blue 💙 Will Moriah Heart This Comment 💕 Because I Heart Her Too 💖
You should make a bubble  gum squishie
Do a squishy makeover and turn the dog in inertube into a baby plsss
I’m hungry now😂
My favorite so far!!! 👏  BRAVO  👏
One of my faves
👏👏
Please do an update on your art room and I also I have a long hair cat too but I have a slight allergy to him so do you happen to know how to clean your pickle so I can love pickle forever
I really liked how the back ground changed even tho it was not intentional.  I think it would be kinda fun if she changed the background and made it like a game like try to guess how many background there are in this video.  But amazing video I love these makeover videos there so fun to watch
Hi I Love your  vids soo much and he was inspired me so many ways
Thanks so much for doing these Moriah! You brighten up our Fridays 😁
Yay, another thrift store makeover! This turned out SO CUTE! I love it <3 <3 <3
i work in a thrift store and is is one of my hates people giving us dirty stuff and expecting us to sell it and we then have to clean it best we can and hope it'll sell but some things are just too far gone and has to be trashed. like the donations are appreciated but i don't think many people would want to buy dirty stuff, it's a time waster having to go though dirty stuff to find something sellable when other stuff could be being done, plus it makes the store look bad and gives thrift stores a bad name and look that they are dirty places  that sell dead people's random stuff. urm nope not any more here in the uk anyway most of them are like normal stores at times and even sell new stock that's been bought in (usually at Christmas), have stuff out according to season, have designer sections. And there's a lot of rules and regulations now of what we can and can't sell mainly due to safety but of course like anything common sense is appreciated.
As soon as I saw the notification I literally got my snacks and drink and then watched it like movie
I can’t believe people dislike Moriah’s videos???????????????????????????????????????????????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
So cute!!
It is sooooooooooooooooo Beautiful I love it ..............I LOVE ALL OF YOUR CREATIVITY AND YOUR PAINTINGS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😆☺️😆☺️😆🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
Idea: She should get some small plastic ball thingies and customize them to put them inside after she finishes the 7 bags of bubblegum
I love your videos they are always so fun to watch ❤️
This is so cute! u should polish the metal part with some metal polish if u have but it is amazing!

You should put different colors and right a list of what the color means I think you should do white as your food animal squishy and so on
Nobody.... who want bubble gum so much
Use the one stroke brush loading technique to make even gradients. Works  fast and efficiently.
You can the sloth Boris to me it sounds like bored there s a name you

OMG MY FAVORITE MAKEOVER EVER (SO FAR) LOL AMAZING WORK
I have some of your merch pickle the dinosaur
Hey Moriah, I don't know if you're ever going to see this, but I wanted to thank you: This past year, my girlfriend and best friend was diagnosed with cancer, so through this terrible pandemic we have been going for blood work and chemotherapy and doing our best to stay safe and positive. And one way that we've been able to stay positive is by watching your videos.  It is a long drive to get to her doctors and a lot of waiting is involved, and over the course of this year I have shown her every single one of your videos starting from the beginning, (the WAY beginning), and it never fails to put a smile on her face and make her laugh. You have no idea how much it means to me to  able to do that.  Literally, even when we are stuck in line at the drive-thru at Starbucks, she always turns to me and goes "Moriah?" with this excited smile and it makes me so happy.  You do that, just by being you doing what you love, and reaching me through that passion, so now I'm able to share that with her.  Anyway, I will stop this before it becomes a novel, but I wanted to thank you so much for what you do, how you conduct yourself, and the positive tone of your videos. (I'm not saying you can't be a real person and have down feelings we all do, but) I really appreciate that you, by default, seem to just be a genuinely positive and kind person, it translates through your videos.  Thank you for all you do, much love, Tessa
we are the Rainbow Sisters  hey opie
i am sitting at the doctors and all the sudden i say it friday and come see the post

Can Bert’s full name be Hubert? It just fits him well.
Hello world!!! Hope you live happily ever after. Hope you learn a lot from life. Hope you get friends. Doesn't mean you have to get a lot of friends, but it has to be real friends that understand you and help you, oh! And also be kind with you 😘 Hope you are happy to have your life and decisions you have made, if you are not,  there is always a way to fix that. Hope there's always someone near you to be there wen you need help. Hope you like this comment.  Hope i didn't mess anything in this comment cause It just came up to my mind lol. Bye and have a nice day!❤️

At the pole or something y’all said she gonna paint something with a bubble gum and I said she gonna paint bubble gum machine and I got it right YAY💙👍💙

Moriah: "I'm kind of scared of that hole... who knows what's in there?!?!?!?!?" My brother: "That's what she said ¬‿¬"
I knew it it was going to be a gumball machine when she saw that gumball video where she blew up gumball
Lol when Moriah sent out the hint for today’s vid I thought she was painting chewing gum- LOL
hi moriah! I got PICKLE he’s adorable 🥰

Omg the editing is amazing
OMG it you i love your vids i have been sub for years

Hello!
Moriah: uploads a video Me: has a fricking alarm for when she post I love you 💕 I'm an og 💗
It would be fun to put some balls with names of the most interesting squishes you have and repaint ones that you get their name from the bubblegum mashine.
I got my friend poscas for her birthday!
I was the 1,025th person to watch this video!😂
I love your sweater so freaking mucchhh
She's used rainbow so much she's started to deny it
Yep
Ok I saw someone else say this but copy and paste this: Moriah should paint a rubik's cube and put one of her characters on each side
I swear Moriah’s editing gets better every video
Have you every just been bored on a Friday and forget Moriah post on a Friday and then when you were bored a Moriah video just pop up in you notifications and you feel happy ??      Or maybe it's just me.......eh idk
These is ADORABLE! I love the transparent sorta bubble gum feel! Amazing 🤩

I completely understand with using the characters that you don’t use as much I even agree!
3:21 lollll wtf
Am I the only one who wonders where or how the heck Moriah finds this stuff when the most exciting thing I can find at the thrift store is a broken ballpoint pen
it's the hole jokes for me ✨
"That just looked like a screeching sound-"            i- uhh HUH
When you gave us the hint on what you where painting on this week I thought you were going to paint on gum for some reason 👉👈

Moriah, your editing is amazing! I love the plop of memes of you! I have a short attention span! Your editing makes me not want to skip! Great job!
Who else thought she was going to paint the base rainbow before she painted it  👇
Moriah is probably the funniest person to ever paint a gumball machine. Or a squishy.or shoes. You know what, she's probably the funniest person on YouTube.

Early squad
Hi!
4:01 its so emptyyyyyy
Hi!!!!! ILYSM 😍
This is 7 minutes ago-
How does the video have less views than likes
Can you please do a rubber duck make over please
Moriah, can you please do a Draw My Life ?🥺 Copy and paste this but don't do it too much, it could stress her out, do it for like ,two times and then stop.
I love your sweater!!!
I'm here can I be pinned
Early gang
Get your before ten minutes here ticket
Love you so much and you inspire me so much
I absolutely LOVE bubblegum. the characters on it add so much more to it, I love it
Moriah:Hey it's Me!       Me: Its amazing time 👁👅👁
New people; "she's wierd"  Ogs:"YOU'RE FUNNY"
Moriah should do a “painting a Rubik’s cube” video where she paints one of her characters on each side copy paste it to make it happen
I love her she's not my favourite I like how sarcastic she is because I'm really sarcastic
I love that something can look like a screeching sound.
In each different space you should have done a different caricter
Me: hmmm what time is it *is ABOUT to check clock.... Moriah elezabeth: *posts  Also me: opp it’ s four o’clock!
Me: thinking I could be early 3.8k people already here
Okay, I don’t know if this is just me, but I’d really love to see ‘painting on notebooks’ not just any old notebooks tho. *not* spiral bound ones, the black composition books that have been around forever 😂 like the spine could match with the middle part that says your name, and a cool design could be on it! But fun and cool! (Well all of her things are F U N and C O O L) anyways, don’t judge me if you don’t like this. And if she even sees this and likes the idea, don’t do it so that we can do it (like things to do when ur bored) bc I wanna see pure art that she can do that’s not for us 💜💜💜💗💗💗💗🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️🧡❤️❤️💛❤️💚❤️🧡❤️💚💗💜😂😂😂😂😂✨✨✨🤩🤩

Hi Moriah, I know you won't see this but I love your videos so much and you inspire me to do art and keep going. I just want to give you a big hug but I can't because I don't live near you and we can't anyway. Yours Sincerely, Rylee xx

Hi Moriah, you have inspired me so much I love doing art and squishy makeovers! Did you know that Earth without art is just eh? 😺 Also, I have the same gumball machine! But I haven't customized mine. By the way, Amazon is stealing your merch and ripping people off, yours is amazing quality and theirs is not. I hope you have a good weekend!
When I realized that you posted I got so happy
mariah i love u make more content u make my day better everyday
No one:  Not even the YT comments:  Moriah: that just looked like a screeching sound.
this was what i really wanted her to paint
moriahs new mearch - dead skin cell hoodie!!! - gesso beenie hat!!!! - or even a moriahs head on every 2cm!!!
I clicked faster then Moriah could say "Hey! Its Me."

You should put like little foam pieces in (like bows, lollypops, unicorn horn etc) it and then do a video were whatever foam piece you get you have to use it in a squishy or base a squishy around it?

Why is everyone here-  I literally just clicked-
Hiiiiiii  Moriah I’m a big fan you inspired  me  So much
Nobody: **Moriah posts** Me: ah yes I didn't need education anyway
Your videos always cheer me up! The rainbow / pastel theme is a good upgrade from the usual aesthetic which is depressing. Can’t wait for next Friday.
who else clicked on the notification without even reading the name
I love youuuuu so much you're such  a great artist, you're  amazingly funny, creative and over just the best
who else thinks she is an amazing person with amazing artistic scale and an amazing personality
I’m excited :>
hiiiii
I love your sweater
I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!!!
I litteraly found the same machine and "costumised" it too but all I did was spray painting it matt black
For the next week I think you should review fidget toys or paint on rubber ducks.         Fidget toys are for people who have tress but other people can have them so don’t worry if you think you can’t and about the rubber ducks...            I think you should paint them a set and maybe make a new series!
Hey you, yes you. The one reading this. Idk where you are or who you are but I know you can get through this. Your so strong and beautiful. Don’t worry. It’ll all work out. Don’t stress. Just breathe. It’ll be okay I promise. I have great day/night.  Love you ❤️

Who else knew it was gonna be a gumball machine?!
*Hey! Could you stop scrolling?*  I know having anxiety is hard. Take a bath or shower. Take some deep breaths, but if you can’t, that’s okay, just relax. Distract yourself. Watch something. Text your friends. It’ll be okay  I know having depression is hard. If you didn’t do anything today, that’s okay. If you can go get some water or something to eat. Doesn’t matter what it is.    I know having ADHD is hard. If you can’t focus, that’s okay. Don’t get frustrated, that makes it worse. Take some deep breaths and go get some water. Spin around in your chair. Get the restlessness out. It’s okay.  I know being paranoid is hard. But know that your home is safe if you don’t have abusive family or anything like that. You’ll be okay. Try sleeping with a light on.   I know being insecure is hard. But your body is beautiful and your personality is wonderful and you have a very pretty face. If you’re tempted to  skip meals, please don’t. You’re amazing. Please just be healthy.    *I love you, stay safe!* 💖            also, girl in red? 😩✋
I love u ur my fav YouTuber
I knew it I knew it I knew it!!! I knew it would be a gum ball machine 😂 🥳 (I’ll admit I am commenting this the second I’m seeing it so I am so looking forward to seeing how this is gonna look!) ❤️
