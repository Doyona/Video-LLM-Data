the super fun adventures and stunning video-ography (is that a word??) both drew me to this channel years ago, but i also love that you both showcase the technical side of things! the amount of work that goes in to constructing a boat from scratch is mindblowing; this crew seems really good at their craft. ^^ the water test was also fun to watch C:
Anti foul ????
Why does the bottom of the boat look like it has been sitting in salt water for 20 years ?
And so many months later, both with this boat and other rather famous YT boat(s), we Monday-morning quarterdeck scrubbers (excluding billionaires) learn several lessons the hard way:  1. never buy a brand new boat, and  2. never buy a brand new design, and  3. never buy a boat built in a brand new manufacturing yard, no matter how famous and successful the manufacturer used to be for the designs and builds made elsewhere.    Yep, that about sums up the million dollar question: if you want to live on the hard semi-permanently, often in distant foreign countries at least a $1,500 airline ticket from the U.S. or anywhere with English as the native language, just violate any or all of the above Laws of Sailing the Bounding Main.  A corollary to the above is: 4. never anchor your million dollar boat on the route to or from traditional fishing grounds, especially those used by half-awake families headed for their personal favorite spot on dark moonless nights. It's a sure way to have a heavy wooden boat ram into your pretty fiberglas  hull.
It is said that it's good luck to make friends with a strange cat...
WOW, I am SO far behind in following your adventures. It's an awesome Sunday here in Southern California, sunny 🌞😎 and I'm sitting here with my coffee with a smile on my face watching this exciting journey continue. Hugs to you both 😊❤😎🌞🌎🐞🐝🌺⛵⛵⛵⛵

When does do the hull bottoms get painted with anti-fouling paint?
ToolTime. I shall forever remember : '' Heidi ''.  - What a knockout. Those leeeeeegs, her figure... flawless. ( I was a teen at the time. )
Love Tim, but his wife Jill (real life: Patricia Richardson) was even funnier!
“everything sounds intense when you don’t know what they are saying .” - Wynn 🙆🏾‍♂️🙋🏾‍♂️
Everybody knows the tool man lol
No catamaran manufactures in the U.S? That seems odd.
Thin black and red wires under the stairs; make sure to protect these.
This shipyard is 4 kilometers away from my home🤪
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Shirley" everybody over the age of 30 knows home improvement. ❤ (But do they know airplane?)
"More powwwer! Hooohoorhoor!" Definitely remember that show.
You have come a long way from getting the R.V....
How do you keep the salt out of all that electronic?
If you don't know Tool Time, you're a baby!
I spend a lot of time in xiamen working on production and always stay in binbei. Glad to see some shots of the lake. Hope you guys got to visit bar street (the Londoner)behind Marco Polo and also coffee street (yundang Lu)
Love the colour!!!🇦🇺🤣
Loved the "Toolman" shoutout!
there are gravel bike conversion kits for brompton folding bikes out there
How do you not realize that the shrouds are to long before you even start. Also how do you not have a better launching system after all the boats they have built. The reason it takes them so long to build boats is becoming obvious. It should never take that long to build a boat of that size. I love the Wynn's period, what im saying is don't ever trust any boat manufacturer. They are just like any other business and cut to many corners   and have employees that don't care about their jobs.
Thanks for all your help, u have great taste in music♥️🦋🙏🏻
Home improvement is timeless!!!
This episode proves living the dream has its ups n downs as well ..but if having a bit of a delay on sailing your brand new catamaran is all you have to worrie about? Forgive me if I don't f feel too sorry for ya 's  lol
We know TtTMT! He's the reason I have a 250 HP Whipple supercharged leaf blower.  Lookout little piggies.
We know tool time
Put up with the weight of the larger folding ebikes, hopefully they fit. A small winch to raise and lower them is not such a big deal.
Be really mindful of those E-bikes...too many of them going up in flames.  Don't want you to lose your boat, or life cause of that.  Get something that is UL listed, and not fake paperwork.  The Lectric XP Lite looks cool, simple single speed, cable disc brakes, and not too wide/fat tires.  Don't get fat tire bikes too heavy bulky, no hydraulic disc brakes (too much maintenance), no suspension front or rear (also too much maintenance hassle).
Whered you get your money from?
One beautiful sailboat.
The Youtube voice is just too much on this channe,  Too bad because it looks interesting. But that upbeat constant youtubey voice is just toooooo much.
You guys are so positive in the face of adversity!!! Really motivating!!!
That may have been an orchid of some kind. Vanilla beans are from the orchid family.
You have a huge boat, get the Lectric ones and put them somewhere else. They are perfect and those baskets are enormous you could leave them in storage until you needed to provision then 4 bolts each and you have a mini car. Heck I am going to buy one as well they are so sweet!
Is that consider a yacht?  😁  I want one...  About how much is it?
every man knows Tim Allen...  lolol...
lovely boat! I will have one too, i think, someday.
Super fun project. Would love to know how moving away from Victron MPPTs will increase efficiency. I’m installing Victron in my van.
Try electric unicycles. They are compact, powerful, have lots of range, does not take up much space at all. You just got to learn how to ride it, but you learn quickly. The newer ones have big tires and suspension. You will be able to go on pretty much any terrain and even steep hills.
Can't wait to see what it looks like in the end!！！
What a beautiful city that is! Looks like Xiamen in Fujian province.
Nice to see it all coming together.
You two were better in the RV’s
Nice looking boat
Gocycle is offering nice discounts for foldable G4i at the moment. We have G3 and G3carbon aboard our vessel and its awesome to drive. Never drove long distances with such an ease and just configured the motor to support while heave load comes to the pedal.
Tool time, oh yeh! I loved tgst show
Tool Time! You need a couple of Binford 5000 solar controllers to really amp up the power!
So happy for you guys!  We went with Magnum foldable electric bikes, lighter than most ebikes.  Best of luck!
12:52  not showing his age, he's showing his type of humor :-)
Outa touch outa time.   Ben watching since u were RV people.   .......
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time. To lose patience is to lose the battle. Patience brings near that which is far. You two have shown strength and composure during your difficult times. Patience will make your journey even more rewarding, and the beginning to a wonderful life ahead. I’m so excited to be one of many followers to be joining you on that adventure.🌬⛵️🌏🌴🦀🦞📸🎣🥽👙🏖🩲🐠🏖🤿🦈☀️🇦🇺

Get a Brompton folding e bike 👌
I just love you two
Question.  If you neeed to get into or behind a panel with a "whisper wall," is there a easy was to get in and put the wall back?
Brompton! High quality and super efficient. Electric or regular. I also have a Burley Flatbed trailer which folds up and holds a couple grocery bags, boxest of stuff etc.
Microcontrollers on the panels are a good idea albeit from a company I've never heard of. You'll have lots of shading issues on a boat and individual microcontrollers will indeed mean more power in that situation. The fule filters, the process you're describing is called polishing I believe. For sure carry spares for the filters! When the growth gets going in diesel it can be a nightmare to remove and it can clog filters as well as injectors. Happy to hear things are moving along well :)
Lols… one of the guys yelled out at the other that "you are an idiot"….
AG-1 😂 Nothing new under the sun. Great 1957 movie called ; A Face in the Crowd, about selling “health” supplements.
so close, and yet, so far.  boat looks like it rides high in the water....
If people don't know Tim the Tool Man, then that is their problem, not yours!
Tool man Taylor
To add to some of the other comments on the ebikes. I spent 10 years working for a bikeshop during the rise of ebikes. I've seen tons of lower cost ebikes come through for repairs, many times there was nothing we could do to repair it, neither parts nor manuals were available. For your purposes, a quality folding bike would be a better option. To break this down in an easy to understand way from a bike guy perspective, a good regular bicycle with quality components will run you $1000 and up, preferably $2000. A good ebike motor system, just the system, will run you $2000 and up. You guys are going to depend on these in the wee corners of the world, where service on ebikes will not exist. Bicycles are like anything else, you get what you pay for. Good manufacturers of folding bikes are Tern, Dahon and Bike Friday. Go browse their websites and familiarize yourselves with what quality bicycles are like and how they are equipped. There is so much junk and fly by night companies in the ebike arena atm I would recommend getting an ebike from a dedicated bicycle company that has been around for years. They will stand behind the product, have a worldwide presence and be there when you need them. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
Look at the Tern Vektron S10 folding ebike.  Alu frame, beefier than the brompton and gocycle, but lighter than the fat tire bikes.  ~49lbs, take the battery off and you are lifting 44lbs.  a lot of nice features - Tern has been around a long time.
Yeah Tool Time😂
Scooters
Just a curiousity ... ah heh, but what have you noticed as far as the chem trails out on the ocean, are they present out there or mainly by the continents?
Tim the Toolman Taylor, hell yeah!
That colour is hideous!
Tool time rocked
14:21 In the immortal words of Chief Brody, "you're gonna need a bigger boat."
This is weird for me. I stopped watching you guys over a year ago (it's not you, it's me. Wait, I didn't change, you did. So maybe it is you. Doesn't matter...) and you still aren't in this boat! Baby elephants take less time! but then sailing them is very tricky. I'll check back in a year or so to see how you're doing.
I loved Tim the tool man lol
Love the video - question if I may; I was looking where they were fitting the Whisper wall, is there any further insulation going in between the frame to reduce heat loss/gain?
For Lectric, I have found that it is a lot easier to move (and a lot lighter!) if I remove the battery first. That will make it a lot lighter that can help with storing it.
For bikes, I'd suggest you try a Brompton.  If you need electric, they have an electric version, but I'd suggest keeping it simple, light and cheap(er).  Bromptons are not cheap because they are quality.  They're also extremely compact, light (especially the P Model) and reliable.  Bonus: when folded the chain is protected so you don't track grease on your legs, tender etc.  Not great offroad, but no folding bike is.
I love the color! Does anybody know what the color is?
i hope the 7 seas below you and the breeze above will treat you with the respect you show for all and god bless all for whom sale on her.
Are you going to have one or two electric bikes?
Very heavy, boats are getting over the top, add a bigger stick and more sail area I suppose.  My 55ft is 7.5T fully loaded, KISS.  Too much complication, too much heart ache, too much time fixing stuff, all taken away from your enjoyment.
LOVE TIM TOOL TIME
dont give up and enjoy
Of course I know about Tim the tool man. 😁😄😃😀
Days turn into months that turn into years. Stop I can't take any more and I'm just observing. Has a way of turning one into a basket case.
Who would of thought ya got to go through the torcher chamber just to buy a boat.
That float test gets a lot of angel's data. I want a HH44.
I want a brand spanking new Case 715 quad track and I want it now, and please throw in a spanking new New Holland CR11. Thanks!
Saw you guys on a NautiStyles video and popped over. I like the style of this video. Very "come along with us" vibe.
A classic Winston Churchill quote seems appropriate here: “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But, it might be the end of the beginning.”
Two electric scooters like a segway one with dirt tires maybe?  but that go cycle looked like it folded easier than the other one maybe you could get dirt tires for it...
#DISHWASHER ‘Name= #StayOutOfTroubleWash!
Does she has OF yet?? 😅
I GREATLY appreciate every time you have a Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor reference!
The launch method is bizarre! Your stress levels must have been through the roof!
we use the same composite sandwich technology to build interiors on commercial aircraft. Its not cheap. Its very, very strong and lightweight. And very durable as well
Mint green is a....BOLD choice of color to say the least.
Even know about Tool Time in England!
Jason I'm 68 and even I know who Tim the toolman Taylor is! You rock, nice boat guys!
yay tool time!!! Jason you know your audience
I'm so sorry to hear you've yet another delay. Ladi and Margaret another amazing couple on Youtube, who in addition to doing van renovations make electric bikes, they may be able to help you out with the bike options.  Also (0's baby here and Tool time was brilliant!
Keep up with the Toolman!
great to  see you almost ready..
Yes!!! Home improvement !!!  Tim the Tool Man Taylor . 😂😂
If it is the first time in the water, why is the white hull stained and dirty?
Mr. Cha Bu Duo
The show was called Home Improvement and last aired in 1999, when he said ten years ago I had to laugh more like 24 years ago.
I had a GoCycle on our yacht in the Med, but take a look at CARBO I think it is. I think it's a Canadian company.
gosh these folks are annoying. we need better sailing content.
Guys do not put a ebike on a Boat,i know it sound a good idea but the risk is Huge,they go boom in seconds,in seconds.
Tool time yes!!!!!!
That keel is huge!!!.....on mine (different cat) I went with daggerboards because of draft...
Just finished watching home improvement with my family.  My little girl loved it!    She’s looking lovely, and your hard work will pay dividends soon enough.   Happy sailing.
Wow, congratulations on launching your catamaran for the first time! 🎉 It's such a major milestone and I'm so happy for you. I've been following your journey, from the exciting news of getting a dishwasher to all the tool time adventures with Tim. It's been a joy to see how much progress you've made.   Launching a boat for the first time can be nerve-wracking, but I know you've put in all the effort to make sure everything is just right. Remember, it's all part of the process, and the challenges you overcome will only make the journey even more rewarding. I can't wait to see your first sailing video on the open water!  Sending you love and positive vibes as you embark on this amazing adventure. Good things come to good people, and you definitely deserve this incredible experience. Enjoy every moment and embrace the journey ahead. Fair winds and smooth sailing! ⛵️❤️
Yes Tim Tooltime Taylor
I got the Tim the Tool Man reference! Made me smile!
Omg she’s beautiful we applaud you for the way you handle the unexpected and yes we’ve heard of Tool Time can’t wait to see the mast and sails🧡
Not sure the Genasun are better than Victrons... https://youtu.be/m-hJIyYFY5Q?si=M7zJNIXyv_TPHqg9
I watched Home improvement all the time when I was a kid! I always loved Wilson
Omg the color is just gorgeous!!!! And yes recognized Tim the tool man taylor lol.
TIM! More power!
The boat is sooo blueee/green it's gunna be hard to spot from far on the ocean.. ultimate camo :D
It'll be good to have a home again!  Thats the main thing.
We know Tool Time!
I know tool time, but I'm 59, so that probably doesn't count.
Of course we know ToolTime!
Binford tools for the WIN!!!!!
I carried 2 gocycles for 3 years onboard through Central America and the Caribbean. They actually held up pretty well i have to say. They aren't mountain bikes by any means but i will say i rode them on trails/dirt roads/cobblestones quite a bit and dragged them through a lot of mud and sand and I never had any issues besides a couple flats. The only thing that happened is some of the bolts and hardware got a bit tarnished from the salt air. I'm sure i could have taken a bit better care of them and prevented that though. I will say you do stand out quite a bit with those fancy looking bikes in a lot of places. Wasn't always a big fan of that. There's surely better options out there but just thought I'd share my experience
Hey guys,  what brand lithium batteries are in your boat.
I have heard a lot of endorsements and compliments about Lectric e-bikes, but that was your go-to company.  Please reach out to them and see what they can do for you.  They might develop a lighter, smaller "cruiser" model for you and other liveaboards.  Take care, and Merry Christmas.
Hi-dee-ho neighbour!  'Home Improvement' was a great show.  I'll show my age, I don't care.
Tim was the man
Thankyou 👍
Thankyou 👍
Man dude I thought at first you were a good man. Turns out you just a man with a great wife. Grow up to be the ma n you want your son to be. Better hurry.
Lectric lite woukd be a good light weight e bike
An interesting idea for diesel at sea. I  wonder if some kind of slack wax or  paraffin could be stored on a boat in solid form then melted and thinned with alcohol or something for use in a diesel engine.
For my boat I've been toying with the idea of getting electric bike parts that integrate into the dingy. For instance, the dingy seats turn into  a chassis. The wheels and hub motors affix to either side of the dingy for balance or front and rear or or some such. When you go ashore you can assemble the parts into a small electric car or two bikes, what ever you chose. A lot of vehicle configurations are possible as well as ways to integrate the vehicle into the dingy. The trick is to familiarize yourself with how these vehicles are made so you can work on them.  There are countless videos online of people modifying scooters, E bikes and the like.
Hi, I’m not sure if this was the video that you’re asking about electric banks but have you looked at the new Brompton electric bike they do an off-road kit which might be perfect. Good luck. Regards, Andrew

I owned a gocycle and would definitely not recommend for a boat and dirt roads
I love Tim The Tool Man Taylor 👏😂
Loving the videos of the build and your trials and tribulations it will all be worth it in the end hope to see it for real in the uk someday x
good old Tim. it got to be big
I know what you are getting, foils!! More power cruising at 40 knots.
You guys have waaaay more patience than I do and to keep a positive attitude ❤
Love the hull colour.
When are you two going to have babies??
Life is good when you get an Inheritance.
Tool Time is the best!! She's looking great! Love that color too

Absolutely do I know Tool Time!!! But I am old! hahaha
Dishwasherrrrrr
Stress is part of life. Stop worrying about the stress you can't change, and focus on the bits you can. Otherwise, stress is nothing more than your body's reaction to things you are not used to. Deal with it. It will make your mind stronger. Weak minds incapable of coping quietly are the biggest downfall of our society to date.
Fingers crossed for you guys. I hope you splash it for real very soon.
❤
Of course tooltime. More power.
If you don't know Tim the TOOL Man Taylor...... we cant be Friends!!!
That is the most ugly catamaran I have ever seen, glad it's your boat and not mine.
The frames around 20:25 remind me SO much of my time in S. Korea.
"No leaks, no leaks, no leaks..."  REMEMBER:  Fix leaks from upstream to downstream.  I suspect there's a ratio between the mass of the people and the boat which enters into the equation of max comfort.  Obviously, many other elements enter into that equation, including hull design.
Some of us get the ToolTime reference ;-) The colour of the hull on the water looks amazing. Can't wait to see her fully decked out.
Enjoy the process.  You are learning so much.  It would be cool if your launch was the first of the new year 2024.
Why is the bottom paint so sketchy?

*Waving my hand like Hermione* I know Tim!! I know the Toolman! 😀
It looks like all the waiting is going to be very worth it. Hang in there, I am sure your both frustrated.  It looks great already.
21:09 Dishwasher ?
Wow, the visa thing. I've seen that get absolutely the most intense of all of it ! Recently even !
The boat is looking awesome. What kind of trees were behind you at the end of the video ? Do you know?
Lectric is too heavy, and the tires will need to be changed if you go offroad with them. I have two of them and I really like them, but the geometry is set very forward which requires an offset seat tube.
Hi, make sure that your electric bikes have mud/rain guards on both wheels, otherwise your bums and backs will get wet 😱😉
Hey, I know "Tool Time" Tim Allen but if didn't put the video clip in I would on not notice you Imitating him
RadExpand 5 Electric Folding Bike  I have the Rad Rover and love it.
Tool time for the win!!
Happy for you to almost be there.
Hovsco and  Rad both make folding fat tire ebikes
Nothing better then tool time!!!
Contact Lectric, we have 3 of their bikes & they are wonderful to work with.
I loved Tim the tool man Taylor lol I guess that say how I am also lol
Dishwasher!! YAY!
Have you looked at this electric bike? I have it on my boat.  Ecotric Electric 20" x 4.0 Fat Tire Folding Bicycle 51lbs with battery Folded: 	◦	38.58 x 24.4 x 33.46 inches
Husband and I have a Lectric XP3.0 bikes that we use on our MY. I love the ride, range and carrying capacity, but they are heavy.. Takes both of us to lift them on and off the boat and 2 bikes won't fit in the dinghy.
Get electric skateboard with large wheels! Like a Summit V3... super easy and fun to ride with great range! It will go from paved, to dirt, to grass, to pretty much any terrain with ease. I love mine and use it often for trips that are around 20 km round trips!
Why the hell did they put it in the water before the bottom of the hull is finished. Now they're putting on the mast without the bottom finished...wtf?
Old guys know Tim Allen.  Been watching you guys for a long time now.  Boat life is now plan B for me.
I know Tim the tool man.
I'm just happy to see the two of you still being, as you are, is always best! :)
Take a look at an off road electric skateboard, like a Meepo Hurricane.
Lectric makes a "Lite" version of their ebike that is smaller and lighter
THAT is your new boat? Do we have the plan correct? And you're worried about the bike. Really? That tiny boat - hybrid or not - that is the worry. Honestly: this whole change (not upgrade) is shocking.
Delays can be so frustrating, but it will be worth it to see her set sail for the first time.
It is all just a part of the journey of building our own boat. The more you are there, the more you learn, and the better you will know your own boat. Thanks for letting us be a part of your lives.
I’m curious about cleaning the whisper walls and overheads.  With the humidity in the tropics, mold and mildew will be an issue.
Have a look at the electric Brompton
Are we going to see a dishwasher installed? 🤔
Getting closer!  Ignoramous question…Why does the hull below the waterline look mottled?
Everyone knows Tim the Tool Man Taylor.
Love Tim the Tool Man!
Hey hey, great to see you guys are back on task! Great clip as usual and I definitely remember Tim the toolman Taylor!
Woohoo! Dishwasher! And of course who didn't watch Home Improvement?
More power!!!!
Love Tool Time. You'll be in the water before you know it. Your probably already there.
Is Jason getting his dishwasher
Nikki - I find that AG1 doesn't taste so well. What to mix it with??

second comment because y'all are awesome! Killin it!
Like and comment for Tim the Toolman Taylor!!!!
Congratulations on getting the boat in the water for the first time. That was so exciting.
I remember tool time. That was an awesome show.   Good luck with the launch. I hope that it all comes together soon for you.
Where r the sugar scoops on her.
That ramp. Lots to talk about.  1. Is it really that steep or is the camera convincing me that it's about 40 degrees? 2. Why is it that steep? The place was obviously purpose built so there must be a reason.
Look at Emerald Bikes if that would work for you.
The Pedego Latch is a light, folding electric bike.  It has 20x2 road tires but you can swap them for something a little more knobby.  They also come with a 5 year warranty and you can test ride one at a brick and mortar store.   Most fat tire, folding ebikes are going to be quite heavy.
hi, did you look at the lectric XP lite, its smaller and lighter than the main one you showed in the video. congratulations on the first splash.
who doesn't know Tool Time? come on now
If it's any consolation tim the tool man tailor is after my time in a way but even I know and admire him 😅
The HIMO Z20 MAX might be a nice foldable e-bike for you.
I got the tool time reference XD
I simply can't watch 30 sec of mandatory ads to just begin. Too bad as I wanted to see the boat.
If you two are ever in Hong Kong, let me know. There's a couple of drinks with your names on it here.

Hey Guys, congrats on the boat. Look amazing, very envious. Give me a shout if you have any questions about shaped pcs, NAS, Media storage and or media server (movies/series) for your boat. That said, it all goes hand in hand with backing up your videos you make based on your country (VPN) via your NAS. I would also suggest they put in Cat 6 Ethernet to data locations and points in the bout for TVs, cameras etc. This is the single most difficult thing to do once the boat is finished. And putting in a Good Wi-Fi system that allows for multiple data sources, multiple GSM connections and Wi-Fi extensions from other Wi-Fi networks for internet. Things like Wi-Fi and devcies Wi-Fi vpn for all connected devices (single pc connections at a time is old school) Happy to help. Im a South Africa and love the ocean myself. Good luck and DM if you want to get in touch.
Check out Brompton folding ebikes. My mate has one and has ridden the length of NZ on it. He folds it down and takes it on a blow up canoe.
OHHH! Jason is getting is corner dishwasher thing!! It looks great! And I love(d) Tim The Tool-man Taylor. It might show your age, but it also shows what excellent taste Jason has!
Too bad Tim turned out to be a Trumper
Hobotech channel reviews several eBikes and does some pretty good shakedowns on them. Just a suggestion. I’m excited for you guys!
Probably just me but it doesn’t have the same personality as Curiosity. I guess what I mean is that it doesn’t seem like you guys. Probably because I was watching you when you were landlubbers and then the headache of buying a boat, taking sailing classes just like so many others. Is this going to be Curiosity II? Oh yeah I know ToolTime Tim!
That looks way smaller than the one had prior. Why spend all that money for a much smaller boat thats crazy.
More power
Yes Nikki, we know who "Tim the Tool-Man Taylor" is😂. It ran from '91-'99 (& still had rerun syndication for 3-5 years after that), and most of the ''adult" jokes were veiled enough that it was a fairly decent family show. It may have started 30+ years ago 🙈, but it hasn't been off the air that long (yet). Every time Jason makes that reference it makes me Incredibly Happy (like, I have to pause so I don't miss anything kind of Happy)! Please don't stop Jason👃
We used to watch Tool Time. Great show, a classic.
I was watching Ambition Strikes. They use Engwe e-bikes.  Doreen
Vanilla is an orchid  bean.
So happy for you two beauties
Love you're channel, been watching from day one, hope you like and enjoy you're new boat. I must say one thing, it is the ugliest boat ive ever seen, but i think you guys are very pretty.
Tool Time with Tim was my favorite show back then.
Of course, I know Tool time.
Thanks Wynns. Time is going to fly like the wind! You guys will be sailing soon..
Lectric makes a light weight bike now, smaller n lighter.
❤❤Congratulations to both of you! Can't wait to experience new adventures with you! A dream come true❤❤❤ Such a beautiful color ❤❤ Perfect name too❤
Be very careful with the electric bikes, they burn. Nice boat, green yea?
Lectrics definitely won’t fit.   Electric scooters will.   And will go off road.      We used to keep our bikes locked to the stern
Sell the boat and have or adopt some kids and really live!
Big tool time fan!!   binford tools forever!,
Yes, I know the tool man. I hope Jason's getting his dishwasher, is he? If you said, I'm sorry I didn't hear you. Have a wonderful week, God bless,  Chris from Missouri
OMG...I cannot wait to see the video of your first sail on her. We have ALL been waiting so long!!!
I live on a 36' monohull and use a Zizzo folding bike. I don't have the electric version but mine has held up for the past 3 years and works great even on Washington hills and forest roads.
Delay, we feel your pain.
Orchid Tree... Bauhinia
Good color choice with the tiffany blue
You know I know Tim the Tool Man. Loved that show.
Boat looks amazing and now not very long untill you will be cruising, fingers crossed! Much say the pictures from the park and skyline are impressive too. Did not expect that from a random Chinese industrial city.
Tool Time👍watched it with my son😊
I'm assuming now she will be done in March let's hope Sooner
Maybe buying just one electric bike would work for both of you.  They make towable and foldable carts that will attach.
Lectric have a mini version - it's about 20lbs lighter than the more common XP (I have both a Mini and an XP2.0). Folds up a little smaller, too, but not sure if its going to fold small enough for your space.
Hey guys. You are in CHINA!! One of the leading manufacturing hubs for bicycle and electric bicycles in the world. Why don’t you asked the Chinese members of HH to help you find local physical stores to browse what’s available or get them to help you navigate the wonderful world of Taobao. I’m sure you will find something a fraction of the costs of those ones you showed and probably as good as them. Good luck and don’t be prejudiced by “Made in China”, your million dollar floating home is made by Chinese people.
I was more fond of Al then Tim lol
I grew up with Home Improvement and The Tool Man!  Even before you put in the clips, I had Tims grunt going in my head :). You guys are being saints with the delays.  Hopefully logistics all work out for you!!
Home Improvement was an amazing show
Jason: “That’s not good.” _commercial_ 😧😱ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That was way too intense 😂
Hang in there❤
Oh we know Tim the tool man! You good, we got you fam!
More Power! Yea!   Delivery on time? I don't think so, Tim.  The best things are worth waiting for.
Nicky your both so knowledgeable impressive watching all the nuts and bolts
About time , I love the way u filled in the time while waiting and waiting for your new ride
I was talking about tool time just two days ago 😂 his neighbor was the best
Couple of things. Why is the boat so heavy? They were building cats in the early 90s and before that were lighter with more waterline. Also they are switching you to genesun controllers probably because they are upconverting controllers. Your battery bank is 48 volt nominal and the solar panels probably probably produce less voltage than this therefore you needed up convert controllers. But you will be severely lacking on the information that you would receive from victron controllers to me this is a huge system design flaw. Not to mention the mistake of going with embedded custom flexible panels, these will not last. They are very appealing from a designer standpoint but real world the issue outweigh the benefits.
Did anyone here get a message from someone claiming to be Jason and Nikki?  Someone asked me to message via Telegram. After a short exchange I am being offered a gift as a subscriber.. And it's an IPhone. I'm assuming it's a scam.
Hey Gang! We were livaboards and now run an electric cargo bike rental company in Ottawa, Canada. A few comments about folding electric bike selection: 1) You get what you pay for. 2) Look for an electric system that is UL certified to prevent fires (ie.Bosch). 3) A bike with a universal electrical system like Bosch means that you can get it serviced anywhere in the world vs mail order bikes that will have proprietary systems that you will have a tough time getting serviced (important in the marine environment!). Fair Winds!
Oooo! The big debate ... a dishwasher for Jason!!! Yay!!! Ooh! Ooh! Oh! Hope it has MORE POWER!! LOL. Love The Toolman! BTW you're too young. You probably saw reruns. 😂
Another fine example of what it takes to build a truly custom boat . So Wise , Thank You for sharing .
Tim the toolman Taylor was an excellent reference. Don't let Nikki shame you for knowing excellent TV
I hope the dude who walks backwards in front of the massive boat gets paid extra
Love the whisper wall or ceiling . Must be a good,fabric that,does not stretch over time . can you show more? And you should try putting in a panel so you know how! Thanks for sharing , cheers warren
🙏🏻🤞🏻
OH YES - I still watch Tool Time!
Everyone knows Tim Taylor!
The UK manufacturer Brompton make e-bike versions. they are some of the smallest of the folding bikes. The electric P-line is 12.7kg (28lbs) or 15.6kg (34lbs) with the detatchable battery pack. They are well made abut quite pricy. Used a lot by rail commuters in London who take their bikes folded on the trains into London each day.
Love the episodes! Nikki - my wants to know what you sunglasses are 😂 Random I know
Look at the Makita electric bicycle, Easy switch batteries
I understand how frustrating the delays can be, trust me! But I love the way you both stay positive. Someone wise once said something like "It's not what happens to us but how we react to it that matters!"
I don't think so Tim
Jason and Nikki, that is so beautiful.  Don the old Chief sends!!!!!!!!!
We have the Lectric Lite. less than 50 lbs. each.
Nothing is all bad!  Waiting out a delay in Xiamen is a blessing as it is beautiful and there is so much to see and enjoy.  I am in Haicang, across the water from you enjoying the autumn weather. I hope you have visited Gulangu Island and explored the extensive Botanic Gardens. The old dock area near the University is good fo a look at the history on the old tea port of Amoy!  Of course the food is fantastic and the people are friendly!  Enjoy your time here.
Everyone knows tool man
Love Tim the tool man
The dishwasher 🎉🎉🎉
I have been watching your videos for several years, and find them so very interesting. Watching how much you have learned and accomplished is highly entertaining. Thank you!!
You two are so down to earth in contrast with your shiny new yacht it’s a beautiful thing ❤we need more stories about reasonable people making it ❤
Try swytch bike
You guys are awesome!  It’s amazing the time and thought you put in to making great videos!  Keep up the great work!!😊
Tool man. Miss watching home improvement
It's the beginning of the beginning!!
Hey guys, I understand your frustration but yet excitement and anxiety but that new big thing better be a dishwasher !! I mean c'mon whats a guy gotta do !!!-- go Jason and love you Nicky but be a good sport girl ;)
It seems to me that you'd need the diesels some of the time.  Maybe not so much when the panels/battery are new..but as they degrade you'll probably need the yanmars more often. It will be fun to see, that is for sure.
Love Home Improvements  Tim The Tool Man Tayler
Jetson Hays foldable e-bike. Maybe upgrade to bigger tires??
I watched Home Improvement because I was in love with JTT (iykyk) and it needed up being one of the shows my mom andI watched together. It's such a treasured show to me for that reason. 90's tv sit coms were the best, honestly.
Waiting with you for Mast Day with bated breath! What a great adventure!
We have the single gear Lectric Bike Lite. Lighter and two inches narrower than the Lectric 3.0. Love the bike. Easy to operate and very comfortable. Head light is very bright. Hand grips are comfortable too. Love the blue one.
Can always show us the 60ft. You know the teaser of the bigger boat
Tim the Tool man Taylor is my spirit animal! !!!!
Tim the tool man was a funny show 😊
Tool Time!  More power!  Congrats on getting wet
Maybe you should talk to Ladi and Margaret about ebikes...as YouTubing Van Lifers that build ebikes, it could be a cool YouTube collab. Plus, they love animals as much as you do so you'll probably like each other
WE know Tim Taylor. I would think the majority of people who can afford a boat are probably a bit older 😊.
Sorry that you've had so many things to challenge your happiness, but great job of presenting the realities of this process.  Looking forward to seeing y'all on board and testing everything out ahead of your future great adventures.
We’re definitely old enough to remember Tool Time! 😂
@ElectricBikeReview is a great resource.   14:31   https://youtube.com/@ElectricBikeReview?si=2QTn8rdaPU-DXweP
Congratulations are still in order….soooooo close❤
Looks amazing! 🌎💕😘😊
love tool time....saw set at disney
About E-Bikes..... We just finished America's Great Loop on a 31' Ranger Tugs boat.  Space was limited for sure!  We bought Brompton folding e-bikes and used them at almost every port.   They were the most compact, lightweight bike that we could find.  They were a bit expensive at $3800/each (times two, since we got one for each of us), but they were perfect!  They can be folded into "shopping mode", which we used as shopping carts in stores during provisioning.  We added a "city bag" on one of them for a bit more grocery capacity.  We also bought better tires (Schwalbe Marathon Plus) so that we could ride on more rugged surfaces (gravel, pitted asphalt, and some trails).  Bromptons are so well made and light that if the batteries run down during a ride (ours never did), you can still ride them like a regular bike with no assist.  Easy peasy. Highly recommended!  Good luck with your search!
Would a onewheel work? Something like a pint?
I am watching, The Santa Clause, at present, but I have never watched, Home Improvement.
New Honda folding scooter
Jason got his dishwasher 😂😂😂
Dish washer?
Wow, what a beauty. It will all come together, boat projects and even new Born are always lasting longer then expected.  So the winglets on the minikeels are actually on the end of it, thought they are located in the middle of the keel. Can you beach the HH44 with winglet mini keels? Would be also really cool if you could compare winglet keels to daggerboards in close haul, how big is the difference and how do the winglet mini keels perform.
make sure the batteries are removable from your bikes so you do ot store them in the hold. Several battery fires on yachts in the last year. Rig up a place to charge and store the batteries outside so you can jettison if they catch on fire.
Curiosity is looking fantastic.  So looking forward to seeing ya all set sail . 🎉
Apart from the size its worth remembering that ebikes are heavy compared to normal bikes. Lifting them out of a small space might be a struggle? I have bought a cube mountain bike which weighs in at 24kg but was also tempted by a fido cargo bike
I'm so excited for you and can also feel and see your disappointment on yet more delays. Thank you for showing us the reality and some of the emotion behind all of this. I'm eagerly awaiting next week's episode. Thank you for taking us on this journey with you.
Look up Ladi and Margaret e-bikes .  They keep two of their bikes under their bed in a van.
Gosh, she is stunning in the water!!!! She was gorgeous out, but wow. Spot on amazing color choice! She looks like a peaceful safe haven. ❤Am I correct in assuming that she’ll wait to get anti-fouling before her final launch?
I am Wilson sometimes I talk to my neighbor over the fence.  Funny thing is my neighbor name is Tim but I Tina have all the tools not him.
Have you considered electric Bromptons? Don’t worry too much about the small wheels, I’ve ridden my (non-electric) Brompton on every surface imaginable. They’re surprisingly versatile & basically indestructible. This comes from someone who’s never owned a car & has 5 bikes so, from lots of experience.
Brompton are the only folding bike brand worth a damn. Their electric bikes are £3000 ish tho... maybe they could sponsor you!
If you want to keep a check on algae and so on, consider silver coils.  I don't know how that will affect diesel, but it's what the water-cooled PC guys use.  Much better than biocide.  For one of our customers we used biocide on their first PC, it worked kind of okay, but the silver was flawless.
Oh, you’ll have to find out…😊
Tool Time Rocked!
Damn.. Home improvement... that's a blast from the past!
For a folding bike on a boat, the Dahon Mariner D8 was made for this purpose (in case the space thing becomes more important than big wheels or electrical)
Don’t know if anyone else has commented, but the LECTRIC XP Lite might work for you.
Yes more power. 🤣
Congrats on a watertight boat ! And the problem with the mast gives you the opportunity to put a nice coin underneath it for good luck.
I have a Lectric 2.0 Step thru. Yes it’s heavy, but it’s built to last. Lectric has different models including a BMX/ commuter type that’s lighter. You can always get a cart that folds up to pull behind. I’m sure you’ll do your homework and come up with an inspired solution.
Bike suggestions. I would go with a non-electric Brompton P-Series. There is an electric P-Series but I don't think that you need it. Then I would go with a onewheel if you do not want to pedal.  Brompton P-Series
Hope it all works out
Loved it when Jill made a guest appearance on Last Man Standing
Electric bikes I can help you there. I bought one this year to use off-road with fat tyres and a 250 watt motor with 7 speed Shimano gears.  To my surprise the ebike was so heavy like 27 kgs it was super heavy to lift in and out of my car.  Once out it performed very well, no doubt there. So I sold it. Now buying a regular road folding bike at just 12kg and adding an ebike conversion kit.  This will weigh then all up 17kg.  Difference being a regular folding bike has an alloy frame but ready built ebikes have a steel frame. Hope this info helps you.
As far as bikes are concerned… Strong, Light, Cheap, pick two.
Electric bike has a new 3.0 that can carry two people. We have the 2.0 models and are happy with them. they do fold but they weigh 70 pounds.
So Close, you can almost taste it!!! She will be worth the wait! Yes Jason, Tool Time reference was awesome!!! Take Care you two, can't wait for the next video!!!!
Of course Tim the tool man is on my radar. 😮
Wow, one of the last huge steps for HH. Once shes launched is when your work will start. Praying all goes well.
Nikki & Jason, I am with you for a long time, and I am frustrated too, but I have faith the result will wirth the wait. Thank you Nikki for letting us in to see your pain and tears, it gives glimps to your beutiful sole.
Tooltime Tim😂😂😂❤
Everyone knows Tim!
Heidi ho, good neighbor, pretty soon it’s off you go!
Why is the bottom of a new boat soiled looking dirty? Even if it is epoxy glue it looks unfinished.
dishwasher I bet it is the dishwasher getting installed.   lol
I recognised tool time Tim!!! well done.
Have you looked at Blix?
Such a beautiful boat! ❤
I'm sure I can speak for many of your fans in saying, we love you! I understand it can be hard large life events going not quite so perfectly. I've gone through some similar things building a barn. But I know the wait is going to be worth it, you'll be so happy. We're all here to support the both of you as you follow your dreams, through the good, the bad, and the delayed. I know it can be hard but keep keeping your heads up, you should be proud.
Tool Time with Tim was a great analogy
Beautiful boat. Great video. Audio levels were all over the place, though.
Grew up watching Tim the Toolman!! What about a big wheel instead of a bike?
Jason - 🚲 Bike wise look at the Qualisports Volador. They're about a grand a piece and do decent trail riding. I've got 'em on the back of my sprinter van and have taken em out in MOAB without issue. Best part is the batteries are in the down tube, so they've got good CG and it's easy to remove the stem for charging. Good luck!
I check in periodically to see if this ninny has come out yet. any day now.
Home improvement Should have worn plaid.  lol
PRETTY AWESOME GUYS,,,❤
We got QualiSports eBikes, they're foldable and only weigh 38 lbs. Fit behind the seat in our truck. They were $1200 off Amazon.
Hey Jason and Nikki, for your folding electric bike you might wanna set your VPN to the Netherlands and search for 'vouwfiets elektrisch'. Here in Holland we know bikes quite well and that goes the same for boats :-D So we have A LOT of electric folding bicycles :-) For example I found a HIMO Z20 (not familiar with it though) for $850 which seems reasonable and might fit your needs. Good luck on the hunt!
Born/raised in Michigan racing boats on Lake Michigan. Couldn’t avoid Tim the TTT if I tried.
Ahoi! Get yourself an electric monocycle.
Congrats for the new beautful boat. I wish fun and heppiness for you sailing your catamaran. good winds
Ahhh I can't imagine your frustration with this one step forward two steps back. Fingers crossed for the next steps to go smoothly.
Tim Allen is the best
Solar Sail  I’d suggest you design a solar foil sail with a short mast to better panel the boat and add some propulsion at sea.
Wonderful build! I truly can't wait to virtually sail with you guys on this thing.  Regarding the e-bike, I would definitely recommend a CARBO. It is similar to the GoCycle, same carbon fiber frame and same high quality components but at a much lower price. Their after-sale support is amazing, and the best part is that they are friendly to their community and accommodating. I imagine if you talk to them, they can perhaps custom build you a CARBO with a similar color scheme to your boat and fit it with off-road tires as well, worth a shot!
Solar panel controllers by Binford.
She is beautiful. All the new boats on the sailing channels are so fun to watch.
Congratulations one more step closer for you guys to be free on the water once again.
why's the bottom looking so nasty?
Tim the Toolman!! I hear ya Jason :)
Some eBike Thoughts: Lectric has great value. You showed the XP 3.0, which if you can fit, would be great, as it has a much stronger motor and strong rear rack for panniers. The XP Lite version is a bit smaller, but the power may not be enough for you. If too big, consider eScooters (electricscooterinsider). There are some great options out there, but you'd have to load up backpacks with stuff vs panniers.
Electric compact bicycle that meets all your wish list wants... I'd recommend the DYU model T1  20" folding bike (some are 250w, others have 350w motor).  Price is 800ish, they make it a grey color that you'd like and,  knowing your lifestyle, it'd be a good match, plus it really folds down while still having those nice sized wheels and off road capable tires.  Magnesium alloy frame is tough but lightweight too.  Nice locking feature, fob, headlight, tail light ... even has  tire splashguards to keep you clean; all for about 50 lbs.   Found a good review someone did for it here on YT ...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSM4wpBz1rw
The weight of your e-bike is in the battery. Most e-bike batteries are removable. Store the batteries separate to distribute the weight and you will be just fine. Everyone loves Al, Jill, and Tim the tool man!! I’m with you!!
Kinda ugly and expensive eh
I'm guessing they are going to paint the bottom after?
It’s so small I thought it was going to be bigger🙁
You need to snag one of those whisper wall fabric tools you showed.
I am so excited for you guys!!  I have been stalking your channel for this moment!! She floats!  Question for you. Will they clean the lower hull before she's officially launched?
I watched Sketch To Sea  splash at the same location, how nerve wracking for y’all but exciting at the same time. I am thrilled for you two, Congratulations
Binford 6100 more power
How much did it cost?  💲💰💵
Love all your videos! This build has been an adventure to watch (can just imagine what your "adventure" feels like). As to e-bikes, I'm a private pilot and have a few pilot friends that have e-bikes they ftake on their aircraft (so lightweight, foldable, relatively small package when folded, durable, etc.).. They've recommended Stark Drive, Montague M-E1 and Brompton e-bikes. Not sure if any fit your specs/needs, but may be worth at least a look.
New boat builds should come with a prescription for anti-anxiety pills to put in your AG1. Good call on the Keenan fuel polishing system. Fuel quality is always suspect in remote locations, the filters should take care of most fuel problems.
Long journey but so interesting ❤
Home improvements, wow! Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time, a looong time. (In my best Obi-Wan voice, which is terrible)
For the bikes, go for Brompton electric bikes. Very small folded. And well proven.
I have a Lectric bike. It is great but I found it too heavy and bulky for my boat. I opted for Kick Scooters. They are super compact and work perfectly for folding and tucking away into the lazarette. I have two types but ya can’t beat Segway. Buy the more powerful one that has pneumatic tires and goes 20mph. It has range of around 40 miles. I found it great so long as you aren’t going too far… maybe 10 miles.  Ya can’t beat a bike though…. I just have not found the right one and I refuse to ride those little tire crappy ones.  Good luck!
Everyone knows Tim Allen!  More power!
Electric bikes can't be that hard to find, your are in China/Taiwan after all the land of electric vehicles, have seen 100s on the local net
Hi. Congratulations on your new boat. Why didn't you go with the Victon MPPTs? I didn't quite understand what type of mppt that was. Looks like a lot of devices and cables. And where will you start your new journey from?
Jumping the gun with this launch. This vessel wasn't ready
"My dear fellow sailors, I understand the frustration of not being able to enjoy your new sailing yacht due to unforeseen issues such as faults in the mast shrouds. However, it is important to remember that sometimes things happen for a reason. You now have ample time to enjoy your luxury floating home and appreciate its beauty. Let's practice patience and remain positive during this time. After all, patience is a virtue of an enlightened person."
Stop whining FFS.
Beautiful boat
I just witnessed a e-bike fire. The guy almost lost all the skin on the legs. In your place I would rater walk then risk loosing a boat.
How about an electric scooter vs bike, smaller space.
Make your preferred brand of bike work.
Just saying Tool time was my jam, and it us on public TV now and one of my 11year Olds favs
Absolutely know Tim .
Beautiful....I have seen the 88 at my marina and these are gorgeous yachts!  Many congrats!!!
Tool time was the best!!
So excited to see the sails ⛵️ Never a dull moment  makes life exciting. Even if you have had enough excitement for a while.
First world problems.
Why is the bottom all spotted.?
Looks great.. I thought they were being built in Cebu but you are now in Xiamen, China, correct?
Did y'all look at Windelo catamarans? Wondering if you have seen their electric propulsion system?
Don't get lerctric folding bikes. We bought them thinking we could put them in a dinghy and bring them to shore to do the same thing you're thinking. They are way too heavy and not easy to move folded. A matter of fact, it's easier to keep them unfolded in the back of an f150 truck than folded. Two bikes Flfolded in the back of my truck takes up the whole bed of the truck. So think about how much room that would be in a dinghy. We are looking to sell our bikes now and are thinking of getting scotters instead. If you need measurements of two bikes folded or pics folded, let me know, I'm happy to help.
How much extra is a "Crows Nest"?
Elektra bicycles are fabulous I own two of them but I'm not sure if they fold they make conventional and electric unfortunately mine are both conventional but like I said they Ride fabulous lightweight and made very well
Hahaha tooltime reference ftw😅
Lectric bikes are really great for a house, but they are heavy and unwieldly for a sailboat.  Brompton electric bikes are amazingly compact and super easy to move on and off of moving platforms.  I bought Lectric bikes (step-thru XP2.0) for my sailboat and then found this out.  Now I have bought a Brompton electric and it is a game changer.  They are expensive.  Since you are in Asia, you can buy a Harry Quinn folding electric bike for about 35% of the cost of the Brompton, however, be aware that there are many little things that make the Harry Quinn not as good as the Brompton.  It depends on your specific needs.  I think I will be trying to use 1 Brompton and 1 Harry Quinn on my sailboat to see how they work out.  I am 80% sure that I will end up with 2 Brompton electric bikes though. The BESV PSF1 is an alternative if you need to have bigger wheels.  It has 20 inch wheels.  The Brompton and the Harry Quinn both have 16 inch wheels.  The issue with the BESV is that while it is compact and light, it is not really designed to be carried in odd situations (like on a sailboat and dinghy).  The Brompton is the most easy to carry.  The Harry Quinn does fold up and lock in place, so it's also easy to handle.  The BESV is light, but does not lock up in a folding position that carries well.  The Lectric does not lock in a folding position at all and really requires 2 people to manage it safely. You mentioned your concern about island riding on difficult terrain.  The Lectric would be the best at this, but the Brompton is still quite capable, albeit sometimes a little more bumpy.  I've ridden the Brompton electric for long rides (40km) on cobble and rough roads and it was really fine.  The Brompton has better shock absorption than the Harry Quinn.  I do not have experience with the BESV on bumpy roads. In terms of carrying capacity.  The Lectric can carry a lot.  The Brompton can carry a lot.  Both of these have very good supply chains for luggage options.  The Harry Quinn is limited to the rear rack, it's actually quite limited in compatibility with bike bags.  I've been trying to build a modified front-bracket so that I can mount brompton bags on the Harry Quinn, but so far I have been unsuccessful.  I have to modify the front brake to make it work.  My HQ mod efforts have really highlighted just how very well designed the Brompton bikes are.  This is why I think I will just end up with 2 Brompton electric bikes. There is a world more that I can share about international ebike laws.  No problems with the Brompton or HQ anywhere.
All good Jason. I'm old enough to know Tool Time
They say SSD drives are four times faster , oh smaller  😎
The big question; how much is the boat costing you?
Have you considered buying a Brompton  bike? They're the most compact of all folding bikes and also come with electric options.  There are also EUC's like inmotion V12HT which are a lot of fun and only take a short while to get the hang of riding. All the best for your new adventures on the high seas.
I remember Tooltime Jason- we aren’t that old mate 😅
Big  debate aka dish washer
more tool time!!! 😂
I love my Giant folding bike, made of strong  lightweight aluminium. They are manufactured in Taiwan,   not so far to go and buy direct perhaps.
Hey guys..I sore the words splash down on my feed and got very excited. I made pop corn got comfy on the couch put you guys on the big screen. And not yet...oh well  getting there...keep smiling..cheers
That was quick! 😂 glad it’s finally done 🎉
+1 Tool Time!
You guys took a HUGE bite....just keep chewing.
Wilson !!!
So frustrating to have to wait. But all important things involve potential delays—break a mast! (Instead of a leg for luck)? 😊
When plans change make a new plan
Tim the tool man Taylor, brilliant reference. Ahh the poor yongan's that have missed out.
Hi there! Responding to your comment ❤ on my comment of 'absolutely beautiful '. She's that and more. Great cinematography and life story.  Been working on my own boat and had to search for your latest video.
Loving the look of it⛵️
I would suggest a scooter design for your "bike" -- just get a seat that can be mounted.  Get one with bigger tires but not one that goes too fast.  Or get a "faster one" that you can get a license plate for.     You are already in China  -- look around.
Greetings from Thailand and happy holidays... all the best with the new boat, I trust it is set up just the way you want... Cheers mates. all the best for 2024.
Perfect harmony ❤
Congrats on first splash!
You only get a first sail once so enjoy the anticipation and let the excitment build.
Did I hear you say they are now able to install the Dishwasher..??  Lucky Jason..!!!  Ha ha ha ha ha
Adventure comes in many forms, this one is life-changing as most good ones are and this is a big one! Congratulations on getting this far. SV Skoiern iV
Love Tim the Tool Man!!
The boat looks so nice guys. I feel your frustration at the delays - there's been a few but wow what a boat it will be! Chin up! the end is nih!
I just bought 2 “Volt Bike” electric folding bikes. The model is Mariner V2, totally weight is 64 lbs. big tundra style tires that rides very nice with all the same attachments you quickly showed. What was the weight of the folding bikes you viewed. They are distributed by a Canadian Distributor here in Vancouver BC Canada but distributes out of Washington State as well. I believe they are built in China. I paid $1,900.00 Cdn. Hope that helps. I expect to use the, on my Catamaran as well. Cheers Doug in Vancouver
so he geting the dish whosher then
⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️❤️❤️❤️🥃🍷
Electric bikes would be essential & perfect. I use a Ariel and love it.  It’s a duel electric (both front & rear wheel powered). Batteries last for about 80 miles before recharging, depending on terrain and speed.  I use mine on beach, in dessert, mountains, everywhere really. FYI.
I have to assume anybody watching your channel knows Time the Tool Man!
Personally, I would have stuck with the victron MPPTs, but then I run a fully integrated electrical system... Battery, MPPTs, Inverter/charger and alternator all integrate through Victron's CerboGX, and let me monitor the whole thing from anywhere in the world.
How about the Lectric XP Lite (46 pounds)?
Buying this boat has made Nikki look more youthful and more gorgeous than before Jason too  I’m not sure you were stressed at all   Some times you just need to breathe and trust the process   It’s been long enough now so can’t wait til you’re off the dock and back to exciting times  Keep the faith, it’s all worth it 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😎
Electric Cargo Bikes!
Feel like Wilson watching this......
Tim the tool man Taylor... You bet, "More Power".
Oh no, poor you. I hope this will be resolved quickly and that you will soon return to your own home on the blue wave.
What happened to the sound? It's kind of tinny.
Check out Jupiter folding ebikes , Carbo x folding e bike or Brompton folding e- bikes. All are very popular with the general aviation crowd because they're light and compact. Jupiters are generally cheaper than Bromptons or Carbo x.. All three are cheaper than Go cycle. Brompton has an outstanding warrenty.
Debate = Dishwasher, methinks! 🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿NZ
Hang in there you two! I can't even imagine how disappointing / frustrating all these delays must be for you guys. But hey! At least now Jason can finally get his dishwasher?! ❤  (PS definitely familiar with Tim the Tool Man Taylor, yes, but.... I'm not exactly a spring chicken myself these days, lol!)
Hang in there, & thank you for sharing the gritty reality of a new boat build. 😅😊
Rad Electric bike has fat tires and folds, I had one extreamly heavy. So much, could not lift it. I would suggest getting a regular 3 speed bike that folds or a electric scooter and beach wagon or big back pack. Check out Sailing Delos, they buy $1000 in groceries for their boat off grid and not sure how they get them on.
Can you take more time and explain how the cabinets are so light?
I saw a Nautistyles video where they showed what they said was your cat, this was probably 12 months ago. Are you actually that far behind on your videos? Just asking not complaining.
On the ebike, you should contact Lemond cycles and see if you can collaborate on something. They are a leader in carbon fiber ebikes. Also, Bike Friday is a world leader in folding bikes and they make an ebike version that I bet would work for you.
Jason NAILED it with the Tim joke... got it immediately!
Electric Bikes - My wife and I have had 6 electric bikes, and we took 2 full sized E-bikes on our 40' Searay.  Full sized bikes were way too bulky to get into the cabin, but were nice when arriving at a new marina.  We now have 2 Lectric folding ebikes on our RV, and they are still Heavy and hard to handle, even with 2 people loading them up on our cargo slide.  They look like they would fit in your forward cargo area in the video, however, they would be a pain to put in and take out.  Also, managing them in your dinghy with 2 bikes will also be a challenge.  Not that it can't be done, but it will be a significant effort.  I did buy 2 Bike Bags to put the Lectric bikes in the RV, and that helps with scratching and insolating the bikes from each other and the boat.  It will also help protect them from the sea water.   Bottom line is LIGHTER is BETTER.  You won't use a bike that is difficult to take out and put away.   Also, I have used road tires on dirt and gravel and while big tires are better, they aren't that much better then road tires.  You just have to ride with I little more care.  Off road tires are heaver and bulker.  Please let me know if you want more detailed recommendations.
Get a e scooter
Don't worry Jason, some of us still remember Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor and can grunt right along with you ;-).  By the way, I think you guys referred to a NAS but pronounced it like "nahs".  I have only ever heard it pronounced with a short "a" sound like "crab".  I also have not traveled the world though so I am prepared to be gently corrected by your very forgiving youtube fans.
I'll politely say it for you: "I'm pissed"! And, "Fudge.... Pass the rum beverage".... Aww shucks Nicki and Jason, I'm so sorry for ALL the stress  ....
KayGee? Actually, KG after a number, is articulated, "kilos" just like LBS is "pounds" and KM is "kilometers" etc... Yeah, it's tricky, l know ❤
All hail Tim the tool man Taylor!!
We most CERTAINLY understand what “more power” means - Tim Taylor is my “hero”!  😅😊
Jason, I got to test out GoCycle during Electrify Expo in San Francisco and I REALLY liked them.
I knew the TTT reference right away. Seeing all those individual controllers is kind of mind blowing. I do so hope you do a solar/energy deep dive.  She looked amazing in the water. What a beautiful colour choice.
Jason and Nikki, congrats on the test splash.  It sounds like the delay is a bit of a blessing in disguise despite the problems for the visa and where to live.  Those Genasun GVB-8 charge controllers are a good choice.  You lose the neat networked tracking and control of Victron.  But Genasun is the definition of simple, light, durable, high quality charge controllers.  They consume very little power, one per panel will add efficiency, and the Boost model will add even more during dawn and dusk or long periods of low insolation.  Best wishes for the final outfitting.
My dishwasher cuts the grass
Home Improvements was amazing... I would talk about it more had Tim Allen not stuck the landing with Last Man Standing... love that guy and everything he has ever been in! But I am really old too, so I suppose it doesn't mean much.
Tool time was awesome. We got you Jason
Home improvement was a great show. did you know they had Tim the Tool Man Taylor on Last Man sSanding, which is Tim Allen’s more recent show
Big Day!
True
E bikes: this video just happened to show up in my feed. https://youtu.be/Rz21E7giJo0?si=zBBZOCMJxXq3Ap3r
You guys must be like a couple of over kids waiting for Christmas morning and seeing what Santa gave you. The butterflies in your bellies must be working overtime. Before you know it it will be move in time. So close now. BTW How are you guys old enough to remember Tool time 😂
Foldable offroad e-scooter instead maybe?
+1 Tim the tool man :)
Careful those charge controllers using are only rated ip40 not to protect for water. Also make sure dielectric grease is used to protect connection from corrosion.
I'm old enough to fully remember Home Improvement. Sucks that you have to wait, but since you've come this close, it would be nuts to have them rush things.
Joke around the boat yard ( Napa CA). When are you going to launch? Two weeks!! Two weeks is perpetual.
I feel bad for anyone who doesn't know of "tool time"
She floats!!!  Your new home!!
I knew exactly what Jason was referencing from tool time…..who doesn’t know Tim “the tool man” Taylor
We all know Tim the tool man Taylor! Hahaha. Great impression by the way.
The end of the beginning...
Waiting makes it that much sweeter, or something like that, yeah but it sucks, I could feel your pain in this video, This is when if it where me I'd pour myself a glass of wine and cry, but soon you'll be in your home, with all your stuff and popping 🍾, then good winds and I'll be toasting to your safe travels.😊❤
onewheel!
Tim the tool man best show ever !😊
I have been inundated with ebikes. Go for one with baskets. I am eying one with saddlebags and  a basket
Tool time!!!
Oh hell no, okay. I’m bent back the other way. It’ll be fine, no worries; but me,myself and I are waiting with  bated breath to be with yall back on the water, looking up your next mountain or monkey. That special home boat is never gonna feel so good as it becomes a reality. Y’all are doing a hell of a job staying sane waiting for your ‘ship to come in’, I’d be completely brain fried. It’s gonna be soo good when everything is made perfect. The Vietnamese with HH leadership will make it so good. Trust, breathe,and find some more cultural things to immerse yourselves into just a wee bit longer. Thanks for sharing your suffering. That’s what we’re here for. Cheers.
Take a look at a Dahon with mid drive, they've been making folding bikes forever and mid drive is far more durable.
👍🏼👍🏼
Re: Bike... I'd like you to consider setting aside your reservations about non-bikes. EUC's (Electric Unicycles), pound-for-pound, take up the least space, give the most range, and are excellent in off-road conditions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_unicycle
So cool that you got to pick your colour for it...looks so good
My mentor.. you are way cooler for saying that Mr Wynns
Well done
Nikky is gorgeous, but your boat is nearly there.  Love from OsoYolo, Antigua Guatemala.
Everyone knows Tooltime …oh….oh….ohhhhh. ⛵️👍🤣 cheers 🥃
I saw you measuring where the dishwasher will go lol
Why does the bottom look unfinished???
I wouldn't recommend the GoCycle.  My friend bought a couple that he put in his big motor yacht and then never touched for a few years.  He eventually gifted them to me, as we were about to set out on our 40 foot catamaran.   I used the bike for the next couple months, where I rode the GoCycle to the local ferry terminal, took the bike on the ferry across Sydney Harbour, and then rode the bike to the office. Within a few months, I noticed some of the little metal connectors and pieces with corrosion forming. I didn't think anything of this, thinking it was merely aesthetic. But eventually the brakes seized up.  From what I can tell, the little connectors actually hold the hydraulic fluid in the brake lines, and the connectors corroded away.  The bike was never immersed in salt water, it just lived in a salty environment (our house is near the water) and was transported on the open deck of the ferry.  We've also found that getting parts is hard for us in Australia.  They are amazing pieces of machinery. They look amazing. The enclosed drivetrain is super nice. Based on my experience, I just don't think they are a good fit for the marine environment.
Does that weight include the dishwasher?
Thanks for being you (both)! You've made such good use and videos in the interim ...you should be very proud. Thank you, and cheers to a big, happy new boat!
I don't think so Jason...
Fat tire 4 inch by 20 cargo inch would be really great, but understand if you don't have the space.   MTB 2+ x 16 should do fine.
Yay for dishwashers! 🙂
Can you power it with a V-8?
Tool time!
nice to see you're almost back on the water!!
Love Tim, the tool man Taylor!! lol
Def know the show Home Improvement with Tim the tool man Taylor
don't piss off the workers. on your boat
Why is it not fully painted?
Congratulations to your new home! Just a little delay.  It will be for your benefit! It looks beautiful!❤
Show us some shopping for lines, storage, provisioning etc….! Would love to see the thought process for that stuff.
hule will clean
You fitting a Starlink system for internet?
I got it Jason
figure out how to make the Lectic work.  Maybe not the 3.0 but maybe the lite.
So close to getting into the water. Nikki you looked really heartbroken / stressed as you were telling us about the mast install issues. I hope you don't have any more major problems.
A big debate you say.  So Jason will get a dish washer.
Niki, Had your boat sank, just think of all the views you would have gotten.  !
Do the bikes need to go in the forepeak?
It is a journey. As I watched your yaght go slowly down the ramp, into the water, I remembered my father lowering his refurbished 45-foot sportfisher from the 1940s into the water at my grandfather's private marina  on the Chester River near Chedtertown MD. My grandfather had a rail and winch system that clicked loudly as the boat went down the ramp, painfully slowly. He named the boat after me, so I wanted to get aboard as fast as possible. I think I was around 7 years old. He, too, had to take the boat out again to make more repairs. It truly was difficult to watch. It was also very cold out, and we had to wait for warmer weather for him to move it up to CT. Where we lived.  Have such fond memories of being on that old boat. May your lives and memories be just as happy, if not more than my childhood, on The Lisa Marie.
Brilllllliant Curiosity - thanks for sharing ⛵️ 👍
Camper van Kevin on  youtube  Reviewed A few of there bikes.  Has a few of them as well   Also he's now An affiliate For Lectric e bike. Might help. You out
Find a foldable bike and add power to it. Switch is one that takes your wheel and powers it with a hub motor.
No insulation in the roof?
She looks great it will all work out.   Time to wish you both a merry christmas and all the best for a Great new year that lies ahead with the mast finally being put in Lol. Cheers all the best x
thanks for sharing. Is this a new camera?
Tim & Tool Time👍
So many delays.  You guys are putting on a good face but it has got to be so disappointing.  Best wishes.
Tool time🤘🏻
Yeah  she floats  congratulations  y'all
TST E bike makes a foldable very powerful e-bike.  You should check them out.
Where is  the factory ?
Tim The Tool Man Taylor was a CLASSIC!!
Tool time Taylor. Great video as usual!!!
Tim the tool man!   I  get ya
Of course we know who Tim the tool man is😂. Yes, I’m old! Lol. This is getting very exciting......too bad you have had to endure so many delay’s!
You asked about e-bikes. We have the Lectric 3.0 on our Beneteau 38.1.  We added the jump seat so it’s a bicycle for two.  Works great, but it is HEAVY!  I use the spin halyard and our electric winch to get it out of the locker.   Would be a much easier extraction if I had a Binford 4000.
That was in fact, an orchid tree :) we have one in our backyard.
Beautiful boat!  Wondering why that cavity in the ceiling did not appear to be stuffed with some kind of insulation?
Dishwasher!
Looks like a couple months till u r set free..
Everyone should know Tim the Tool Man Taylor
Onewheel is the smallest.  I believe pedgo make a smaller folding bike . I'll look at the ones on my dock.
So excited for you two and new adventures
Will continue to wait with and enjoy seeing each milestone. ❤
Damn beautiful boat.
Beautiful! Looking forward to seeing you guys on your first adventure! ❤
Where is the bottom paint?
WHOA ... now this feels real again!
Jason finally getting his dishwasher I'm guessing!!!!
I am wondering why the below water part of the hull was not painted but the above water part was? I am sure there is a good reason; just wondering what it is.
My 30 year old son knows who Tim the Tool Man Taylor is!!  He used to watch it in reruns after school. 😂 So sorry for your delay - I know how heartbreaking that must be!  Praying the process is sooner rather than later!!  🙏🏻  So happy for you both that you are almost to the end of the massive project and can set sail again soon! ❤
You'd better have some Binford tools on board. 😂
RadExpand 5....out of the states I think.  There pretty popular here in Canada.
Fun day, excellent instructor..Tks GAH-D & Mal. Alan
I wish Tool Time was still on, one of the best tv series that was funny and family friendly. Sorry there is a delay but you guys are sooooo close.
Tim the tool man Taylor! I actually have lived his life.  He didn't have Google but we do Thank God 😅
Did I miss something about antifoul?
I know the tool man , and I still do that every time. I see something really cool. lol
Wilson would appreciate this!!
Go team Tim👍🏻
With a seperate controller per panel, your going to get maximum shade resistance, on panel is shaded, every other one will work as planned! Awesome setup! What brand are the solar panels? Solbian?
Yall ❤️ the boat is beautiful! I have a very small Marine Supply store and the interior walls are "Seafoam Green" very close to the color of Curiosity II. When you arrive at the boat launch on incoming Tide if the bottom is white sand you will see "Seafoam Green" the prettiest color on the Planet.  -Cliff Battleship Marine Supply  Fairhope, Alabama USA
LOVE TOOL TIME!
You complain about Tool Time, I complain about Monty Python. The worst part of getting older is no one gets my hilarious Monty Python jokes any more!
Nikki in this video, I have notice your eyes not functioning together. I never noticed it before. I have stigmatisum, may be what Im seeing. I just want to make sure everything is OK for you.
Have you looked at Letric? They are foldable.
She's BEAUTIFUL. Great color. Highest Blessings
Sorry about the delay. The boat looks fantastic in the water.
Home improvement ❤️
That’s a great use for Tim’s grunt. I approve Jason.
MORE POWER!!!!
Did they accidently make your boat smaller? (Mast trimming, bikes not fitting) I'm so sorry for your delays😢, is this the norm ?? They've pushed out this size a lot, are they trying to benefit from your you tube?
Checkout the lectric lightweight version
a foam core carbon composite is exactly the right application in this instance, maybe overkill in the strength requirements but hugely helpful in its weight savings.
Binford 5000 Dish Washer/Melter!  Yeuh!  Rah rah rahhhh!
Just make sure you buy a reputable brand ebike with a smart charger!
Why are there blotches all over the white paint on the bottom of the hulls?
👎🏾👎🏾 on the color
I loved that show with Tim! Love your boat. Best color ever. Looking forward to seeing you both out on the water😊
Looking forward to seeing the installation of the dishwasher.
Love the tiffany blue color
LOVED, TOOL TIME  😂
Why does it llok like a 55 or 56  chevy with the front cut off
Nice to see your boat in the water.  Just picture yourself sailing by the end of March and anything earlier is a happy bonus.  :-)
Who doesn't know 'Tim the Toolman'?
is that wood framing?
Tim the tool man, Taylor. Oh yeah  I’m with you, Jason.   Oh, Jason and Nikki   Are you getting your dishwasher Nikki? I hope so.  I love the name of her curiosity is so apropos. I’m so sorry for the frustrating wait. It’ll be worth it once you get it all together. You’re just so close you can taste it and so far you’re not there. Oh my gosh I’m feeling your pain. I hope this doesn’t screw with your visas. Hope you get the mast next week. Looking forward to the adventures ahead.   Sending lots of love from LIZ in California.💜🤟🏻☃️🎄🇺🇸
OOOHH, Jason is getting his dishwasher.
Jason the tool man tàylor lol
Im glad she floats im glad for the dishwasher im sorry for the delays im excited for the next adventure  Where to next who knows cant wait Soooooooo stoked thats a word i have never said and will never say again
😊❤👍
Carbo model x for ebike.
Dishwasher? Is that pone of the. last minute decisions?  Floating new home - how excioting! Buy the e-bikes you really want, and the space will come apparent for them.
HH Should be able to knock out a carbon fiber hybrid mountain bike for you.
Tim? Yes. Many guys use that sound for "comedy".
Never understood why you didn’t keep the first curiosity while you were waiting for this one.
I have a Lectric bike and a Catalina 320 sailboat. These bikes are just too heavy to take on and off the boat even folded.
Since you saved so much weight on the dingy, get the e bikes that you want and put them inside the dingy or to the outside of the davits on bike racks. Oh And have them put solar across the debits to charge that water Car and e- bikes. It's so much fun to spend other people's money. Love you're channel. Maybe I will see you in the philippines. Maybe you can charter me and my new filipina bride for a honeymoon. Blessings...
I have the lectric. They are HEAVY!
I recommend Brompton C line 6 speed. No need for electric since it has 6 well-spaced gears, everything is well made, really small when folded, and minimal maintenance requires. Except for some really chunky dirt roads or single MTB trails, Brompton bike can get you everywhere else.
Just curious why they wouldn’t measure the stays exactly the same as the ones they’ve already launched?   Seems like a stupid oversight.
I love the color, it looks so great on the water!  Also, Home Improvement was great, MORE POWER!!!
We have 2 Gocycle G3 on our 38’ monohull… They are brilliant, way lighter than other electric bikes and fold down really small (the g4 is a lot easier than the g3) The original tyres are rubbish, but they are the same size as BMX tyres! Off road is amazing! Get them second hand for half the price 😊
Yes sounds like they are doing the right thing with the solar. Much better and a lot more efficant. Good move from your solar enginear. Been interesting to watch this build. Supper interested to see how well this hybid performs.👍 🖖
I like my Fafrees F20 Light bike. Not sure if you really need the fat wheels, I guess in most circumstances you would not, especially for groceries or checking out a town
You need the banana peels, lot and lots of banana peels.  😮
Congratulations. So happy for you both, where this channel started compared to what you’ve evolved it to  now is something to be very very proud of ! Big fan.
Everyone knows tool time! (says the Gen-Xer)
The dishwasher!!
Let's hear it for Jill, Tim The Toolman Taylor's long-suffering wife!
Yes. Tool time. Your never too old. 🇨🇦
Ten times further on an e-bike?  Normal bikes don't need a battery - infinite range.  E-bike provides no exercise; that's not exercise.  Normal bikes have more options, and can't have battery fires.
For Cycles - we have a Go cycle which is great and stable but heavy and big. We also have a Carbo which is much lighter but a bit less stable. I would get a Helix if I could today. Very light and decent size. Hope this is helpful
Time will go faster now..
AG 1 how would rate the health benefit ?
Why are three no people outside?
The feels... Hope the sails are/go up without a hitch. And get Jason a Beer making kit... Yall need a keg to trails like this.
I am looking at ebike for my Class C.  Having the same debate fat tire verses regular tires.  The fat tires on the Lectric would do good in sand.
Why does the underneath of the boat looked unfinished? Splotchy looking?
Tool time was so funny. I loved that show. The boat looks awesome!
Fire hazard with e-bike batteries.  Bike batteries have cause many fires in condo, etc. & an electric battery fire cannot be  put out (chemical reaction & does not need air).  Caution!!
Why was the lower part not painted ??  Fantastic day for you guys
Tim the Tool Time! I watched each and every episodes. r r r r
Love the color, can't wait to see it on the sea!  Go Tim the tool man, more power is good!
E-bikes catch on fire dude not worth it don’t do it
DISHWASHER
Carbo folding bike
Will you have a charging point inside the “bike” locker?   Could be really handy 🙂
Wooohooooooo! It's always a good sign when they float lol.
End of the beginning 😅?
Jason, you need to talk to Wilson...
ooh ooh ooh  almost there  ooh  ooh ooh .
At least you have a dishwasher 😎
Juiced and Rad bikes I believe both have a folding fat tire bikes.
I watched Tool Time back in my 20s.  When it was on ........So i guess I am showing my age too.
We have the Lectric folding ebikes and even though they fold, they are very heavy and bulky. While I was watching you in that small area you mentioned keeping them in, I visualized you needing a winching system to get them out and that's if one would even fit. I would suggest some kind of electric standup scooter and a backpack. Even a standard folding bike would probably be too bulky in my opinion.
ooh oauh  oah!
Jason and a dishwaser.  Sounds like Tim.  lol
Jason gets points for quoting Tim Allen.  Straight up.😂
You're both incredibly graceful about the whole process.
Note to self  , don't get it built in Asia
with all that POWEERRRRRRRRRR it better be Jason's dishwasher 😂❤
Yep! Dishwasher-time!!!! ✅
And Ebike you get what you paid for it! I prefer this I know it's not real cheap but I went throw 4 and I got this! LOVE IT Use it on the beach and trail and city! Has room to carry stuff and folds up! Lectric eBikes 2311 West Utopia Road Phoenix, AZ 85027 and it like 80lb-90 I forgot
About the mast: could you guys explain in the next video more of how it works on a catamaran? I was surprised that it didn't go down into the hull deeper(just attached to the surface).
Congratulations on getting her floating.  I know the HH guys know what they are doing.
I just knew that was why you missed posting last week. BOAT time!  It will all be done soon.  Excited for you both in your new home!
Can't wait to see her bottom painted!
Does anyone agree that Nikki looks like a young Audrey Hepburn?
Check out Bike Friday New World Tourist (model) with e-bike added.
12:47 Have you decided where you will install the Binford 5000 yet?
I'm so happy for you guys! And wow 23k in weight LOVE IT I build Boat for 30+ years
Soldierknowsbest channel has been doing ebike reviews for the past few years and i think you could gain some insight into different brands of ebike to work for you. Mostly road bikes but he goes off road on grass, dirt, gravel, and uneven surfaces.
Gorgeous boat - congratulations. Hang in there - you’re almost finished! Can’t wait to see Curiosity off on the first adventure.
Boy, are you guys are brave, or?
Nice camouflage colour for when your in tropical waters. 😅
Congratulations on your splasing💫✨💫✨💫I really understand you Nicky…you just have waited so long for this and these delays are very frustrating….😟😬😬but… you know what..as soon as you are out there on the 🌊🌊🌊🌊you will just be so happy…and this will fade in your mind…and …this too will pass…the waiting…sending you lots of good energy across the oceans from🇧🇧🙋🏽‍♀🌈⚡💫✨🍀🩷from Nicky
Tim the Tool man!! We know who he is :) .... Dishwasher tease?
...got a saddle' shoe vibe!
Im so excited! and I dont have to do dishes!
I'm sorry, just hate the color.
...this is a Day of infamies for all of Oz! and their descendants!
What an exciting time for the both of you! As far as bikes go, though it may not be an off road bike, have you heard of Carbo Bike? It is also foldable and made of carbon fibre. They run ads all the time and they have a YT channel too. Keep us updated!
By the way. The CARBO e-bike also has a belt drive o-tion so you don’t have to deal with rusty and greasy chains and derailers!
Victron seems more reliable.. I think
Does the very bottom section of the boat that was sorta white get cleaned up or "painted" white at a later date?  The color portion is just stunning!! Sorry for the disappointment regarding the mast. But it floats!! :)
Hello Jason and Nikki - I might be stating the obvious but why do they have to be electric bikes ? So many smaller options if you go standard (ie Brompton). I would assume when you actually get off the boat you want to build your cardio - what better way. It’s not like you are both in your 60’s
Brompton bicycle with a switch bike kit
Look at Brompton! I love mine, but maybe not off-road. I love mine, electric.
Arrr arrr arrr, more power wooohooo arrrr! Jason the tool Taylor!
What a gorgeous boat!  As for the e-bikes: Are you trying to store them side by side, one in front of the other, or against the hull stacked?  If against the hull could you come up with a hinged shelf that the upper bike would be on?
Tool Time Taylor, no worries Jason, your not alone! She looks bueatiful, yes you too Nicky ;) you need a NAS system - Network Accessable Storage - I have a Synology multi drive system  using  a UPS system to avoid electrical hickups if power conditions should occur. Great system and reliability. One drive goes down, no data is lost. Look into it, worth it for the nature of your work.
More solar power is great, but Tim would be more interested in Diesel power... I suppose you know this and have a plan for rotating or using your fuel.  Studies have determined within 28 days of storage diesel fuel #2 begins to become contaminated and start to degrade. Diesel fuel can only be stored from 6 to 12 months on average — sometimes longer under the best conditions. Diesel Formula STA-BIL®Opens a new window whenever you put your diesel fuel engine or diesel equipment in storage, specifically 1 ounce for every 5 gallons of fuel. This will keep the fuel fresh for up to 1 year before it will start clogging the filters.
I have a Carbo X folding e-bike. It’s carbon fiber so it’s very lightweight for an e-bike at 13kg according to the ads, but with fenders, rack and lights I weighed mine at 41 pounds.  It, like the GoCycle has 2 inch tires. They are Schwalbe Big Apples which are balloon tires for a more comfortable ride. It’s a Canadian company, but like most bikes the factory is in China.  The only negative thing I can say about Carbo is that the battery is in the seat post, so it would be difficult to carry a spare, but it goes pretty far on a charge and can be charged on the bike, or there is a quick release to take it away to charge. The X model is single speed with a belt instead of a chain. I haven’t found a hill it won’t go up except one time when the battery was low. The S version has a chain and gears, so it could be ridden on hills without the motor. I have an old mountain bike that I used to keep at the marina and on the rail of the boat and the chain has rusted solid, so getting a boat bike with a chain means you need to wipe it down with oil and little more than I did with that one.  I also have a folding fat tire bike which I bought first with the idea it would be a boat bike. It’s 75 pounds and it takes up a lot more space.  I have seen more recent small e-bikes that have suspensions front and back for more comfortable riding on bumpy roads, but I never remember the names.  The other place to get a lot of bikes is in Taiwan. A lot of European brands are manufactured there and it might be possible to custom make some bikes there if you wanted something specific
buy a one wheel LOL
More power!!! Ar Ar Ar Ar! 🔨
With the GoCycles you could just get different tires for them with a different tread pattern. They're plenty wide enough.
12:40 🙋🏽‍♂️I know❗️ Tim  🧰 “Tool Time” ⏰ Allen 📺 👀 😆
Tool Time FTW :)
Come on! I love Tim the Tool Man Taylor! More Power!! Lol. Well everything didn’t go as planned but good things come to those who wait. If they could’ve finished somehow but it wasn’t perfect and they gave you the choice you’d absolutely wait till it was perfect so I guess make some lemonade. Can’t wait to see your first sail.
She’s looking good. Can’t wait til next week.
I know Tim the Toolman:)
jason I have lectric bikes and xp lite is only 47 lbs the new boat is so lite you can afford the weight you will love them
Electric scooters are soooo much better value than electric bikes. I used to build my own electric bikes, but if I wanted electric transport for my electric boat now I would rather go for a stand up scooter than an ebike. They come with suspension, and they're far simpler and cheaper than ebikes.
Have you looked at the Blix electric bike? Or the Specialized electric bike? I believe their tires are larger but they may be lighter.
21:16 🤔 you’re retiring Jason as your husband 😮, er, ah “human” (auto correct  🤨) 😘 dishwasher & getting a mechanical dishwashing machine 🎉 🙌🏽
Looking good so far! I'm curious to know what are the black rectangles below the waterline on the inside of each hull? (Thats outside the hulls on the inside of each 😊)
AT LAST!!!!  I’ve been waiting for this. Started watching now….  and don’t worry
More powere ho ho ho!!!!
I loved the Tim reference. I'm only 30 so I had a pretty good childhood with tv and movies :) LOL
did Jason get his dishwasher????
Can't wait to see ya on the water in 3 months
Electric bike? Nah, EUC. All kidding aside. maybe store one on each side?
Look at Brompton folding bikes.
Jason hit Captain Rick Moore up over on Sophisticated Lady about those E-Bikes your looking for. He's got some good knowledge on that problem that could help you out more... 😉😉😉 Nikki quit stressing out... Your almost there. Breathe and relax. I know it's hard without your wine bongs but it's coming lol
Tool Time was a really good show!
Yay..... Jason's getting a dishwasher. Congrats.
So I rewired it!!!
Does everyone know what time it is?!
The last 10% of most things manufactured seems to take the longest... light is visible at the end of this tunnel, and what a beautiful end result.  Know you are anxious to view the harbor from the rear-view mirror...  Looking forward to your next report...
Tool till was the best
Jupiter Bikes are lightweight and durable making them easy to keep in small size vehicles such as, airplanes, RVs, car and I assume it would fit on your boat.
well, it's CHYNNA, so.....
Good things happen to those who wait - even though sometimes it's really, really, really hard.  Enjoy the ride!
One Binford 9000 solar controller per panel?  I don't think so, Tim...
You 2 are so kind and fun and funny. Another super video
she's a beauty!
thanks guys, cant wait til next week
This has taken a long time. Even if I could afford one, I don't have the patience to wait.
We have the lectric XP 3.0 & XPremium. The XP 3.0 would be perfect, go with the extended range battery. Get a few extra tubes & tube protectors. Just a heads up the factory baskets are really heavy duty & also heavy. The XP 3.0 weighs 62 lbs. with the front and rear baskets it’s closer to 75lbs. The rear rack has a 150lb weight rating. If you get the passenger seat then you two could go out and explore.
XiaMen？
Have a think about electric scooters, everything’s a compromise right
Congratulations!   Finally!  They're going to check all the systems...including the dishwasher???????  Avast the mast!  I'm glad you've found other things to keep you busy while the mast issue is taken care of.  My guess to for Jason just beginning to learn all the systems before things go wrong as they always do.  Looking forward to next week . Un  abbraccio forte a due!
Love tim the tool man Taylor
AGE, I don’t want to hear it. I will be 70 in February! I was 14 when Kennedy was inaugerated!
One suggestion for a smaller folding bike might be a Carbo Model X. Still doesn't have your big off-road tires though. Looking forward to hearing what bike you ultimately arrive at...?
This reminded me of a news broadcast in which a yacht was launched   .   .   .   and sank.  It was more than 50 years ago.
“More Power, I don’t thinks so Tim” …… of course any buddy in North America knows Tool Time, your wider audience may not.  Looking forward to see how that Hybrid drive setup works for you.
Spray water see what hatches leak
Re eBikes, try Brompton Electric - been using one for years, even off road, brilliant design!!
I know you guys love the color of your boat, but I really don't like it.  Sorry.
For bicycles, look at MiRider ~ we have them and they are amazing ~ off road tires and UK built ~ go for it xx🚲🚲🚲
Very excited for you guys! I can only hope to be in the same situation sometime soon. Congratulations and bonne chance!
She sure is pretty 😍 here's my advice don't get electric bikes, just good Ole peddlers! Reason: 🔥
Congrats you two. Did you struggle with any of the obvious air pollution in that area? The city shots feature a constant fog of pollutants.
I seriously wanted to merry JTT😂
14:40 regarding your electric bikes please make sure you are not getting anything with over 250W continuous and look for pedal assist only with a max of 25kmh. thats the most common restriction put on ebikes globally and you really dont wanna be caught somewhere driving an illegal vehicle without registration and insurance.
Get yourself 2 NIU Kqi Air scooters made of carbon fiber. Weighs 26 pounds and stores very well.
First off.... anyone of the age that can afford a brand hammer new catamaran without a lottery win... knows about Tim the Tool Man. In regards to the delay... sounds like a 1st world problem and no sympathy from me...  Suck It Up....  the splash date isn't that far away.
One wheel or something.
😂my wife is watching the tool time Series
Congratulations for almost being at the finish line. The boat looks great, especially with all of the new technology. Looking at the ceiling without insulation. How will that be for outside noise? Like rain or whatever on the roof.
I have the FASS setup on motorhome for cleaning the diesel fuel. Life is give and take. Thanks for another chapter.
She is beautiful. Congratulations on this step!
🌊🌊🌊⛵
So frustrating.  You've waited so long. Hopefully the mast will be fixed very quickly and, very much looking forward to seeing Jason's dishwasher 😅
You guys have spent a lot of time and more money invested in this  HouseCat.  Just think of the adventures and the people you have met during this process. You are entitled to feel OVER IT ALL.  I get that way just painting a room!😂😂 It seems to me that HH wants it done to perfection as you you do. Another builder may have rush it and just handed over the boat. I cannot wait to see you two Unleashed. My heart will sing❤❤
grew up on home improvement! hahah howdy neighbor!
It’s a bit like a shampoo ad “it will happen!”  Patience is a virtue? Oh well what’s another week?  Take care and enjoy.❤
This reminds me of getting something (much less fancy!) installed at my house, many years ago. The salesman said, "We've got two crews. One can install it fast, the other installs it right." I went for "right." They seemed to take for-EVER, but their work lasted over a decade, until I had it uninstalled. Patience is a Virtue!! 👍☺️ I know you guys are SO READY to be back aboard your own vessel sailing, but in the middle of the ocean, in some less-than-ideal situation, you'll be all about "right"!! And, of course, you know this. The waiting is the hardest part!! P.S. THRILLED to learn Jason gets his Dishwasher!! 👍👍
Fun video. Is that smog?
Woo-hoo!  Finally.  Getting close to departure.
Ahh yes... Home Improvement... I miss Al Borland... He was the original Ron Swanson...  😀
Curiosity is beautiful. Your choice of paint scheme is perfect. I love the green color. She looks like she's flying along at 20 knots just setting still. Sail away. Shalom
DISHWASHER!!!!!!!!!!! LETSSSSS GOOOOOOO.
I'm a big fan of micro inverters over central inverters. Down the road it's going to be a lot cheaper to replace a problem child if and when one goes down.
Everyone knows Tim the tool time man. Argh Argh Argh! RSB
Brompton Electric - p line (has titanium parts)
The delays have to be so frustrating. You guys are staying remarkably positive about it - at least on camera.  One question though - why were the bottom of the hulls so splotchy looking? Looks like they didn’t get painted
And splash. Did HH give you this boat or discount it a lot.
That big debate you had at the end there  ?   Was  that a mass debate  ?
Mint chocolate chip ! Nice to see no sail drives for safety. Merry Christmas good luck good health and good fortune to you and all you care for in this big world!
tool time!
Wow guys!  ....   As I can't even IMAGINE how frustrating, disheartening, depressing, aggravating....  or whatever other description you may want to substitute, Just please just remember, you guys are gonna have that boat for the rest of your lives and it should perform almost flawlessly once you take possession of it.  I KNOW it must be difficult waiting and waiting....  then waiting some MORE!! ....  Wow, but you guys are JUST about to embark on the journey of a LIFETIME and in a vessel that's going to rival EVERY other sailboat out there on the seas!  I'm SO happy that it's come this far even though it's WAY past the proposed completed date.  We're ALL looking forward to you guys taking ownership and heading out to all that the world has to offer!  SOOOO proud of you two!!!
I don’t think so, Tim.
big wheel elect scooters, more compact
Great video.  We are with you, we feel the excitement and the anticipation.  As for the delay, I suspect getting the mast and shrouds right is quite important.
Everyone should know about Tim the Tool man,  with Wilson over the fence, and of course who could forget Heidi.
Don't let her tell you that we all know tool Time
I absolutely DO know the Home Improvement reference and knew it immediately.  Thank you very much for that Jason.  My wife may not have enjoyed it quite as much as I’ve been known to spit out the odd- “I don’t think so Tim” comment here and there always getting the same response- “My names not Tim”. Lol!
I have a Lectric XP 3.0 and I love it but you would be hard pressed to get one of them in and out of that spot on a regular basis. Do you need both bikes to fit in that compartment? Because if so I think you may be out of luck with e-bikes. I don't know of anything that folds more compactly than the gocycle. Maybe Vello but they have the same city-bike focus and hefty price tags. The only other one I can think might work for you is the Lectric Lite which is at least significantly less heavy than the XP which would make getting it in and out of a compartment like that much easier, although I don't know whether the folded footprint of the Lite is much smaller than the XP, in which case you still might run into problems trying to store two of them, especially if you need to have racks on them for cargo, etc.
Can you give us the dimensions oof the forward lockers ?
Yes we know Tim the Toolman! We're similar age, and it was definitely a well known show of the time!
Jason, I for one, appreciated the Tool Time reference!
Checked out top ten Canadian foldable e-bikes. Top was Hitway ($1,399) measures 900 MM length & 790 MM height. Have many styles of course. Looks great but imagine u don’t want to ship that far. Fun to research anyway as I’m looking as well.  Looking forward to more boat progress. 🇨🇦 ❤
For the life of me I can't understand why so many sailors would rather take a beating than run their motors - The newer motors make much less noise and I for one find that small amount of noise comforting knowing that I can count on them when I need them . They need to be run under load at least for an hour twice a month - you will not DIE!  Don't run them and they might not be there when you need them  - bad fuel , starters that won't work ( remember the genny on your last boat ) ,relays stuck etc.
Love tool time!!
We all know tool time, some just have access errors.
I hope all goes well soon with the completion, I am excited for you two.😊
I knew Tool time without the video assist! Nailed it!
Dishwasher!
Have a Gocycle for years now. Yep, not for you two. You should have either knobby tires, or at least non-inflated tires. Price has also gone up alot. Other than that fine for biking San Diego.
⛵⛵⛵⛵⛵
check out engwe bikes, some of them fold in half
Sound design is 🔥
Oooooh-wee, Jason gets a dishwasher for Christmas! Happy Holidays, Wynns.
Love your plug for free electric bikes. 😅
22:14  Totally got the Home Improvement reference.  Gotta love "more power". I bet this whole boat-building is beginning to feel a little bit like a Tim Allen episode.  Oh No!
E bikes  I commuted on Montague folding bikes for years.   Made in boston for militsry ops.   Have owned Mountain version and Custom 29" folder.   They usdd to make electric with removable battery pack.   Different ebike design now, but i trust company.   Same prices as GoBike
Thanks!
Beautiful baby blue color!! Im digging it more and more every time I see it. Just maybe don't get lossed and need finding lol
The Lectric XP Lite doesn't fit in the space? Folded size is 36L x 16W x 26H. We test rode them last week and it was zippy and quite stable. Plus serviceable unlike some of the other smaller folding bikes, ie Jetsons.
That boat is beautiful it’s gonna be epic
You’ve done great filling content since the last boat but I’m really looking forward to this new chapter going forward and it looks stunning
Congrats on getting her keels wet. Suggestion, don't put the bikes up front when you're access onto Curiosity 2.0 is at the back. It means you have to man-handle them along the sides and the potential risks that brings.
Well, so far it floats, that's awesome. And I love your color combinations on the boat! So don't sweat the small stuff. SEMPER FORTIS.
DISHWASHER!!
Y. E. A. H. ‼️ 🎉   Jason is getting a dishwasher 🎉🎉🎉 Not just for Jason....it only makes sense.  Bummer on the mast issue. It will be glorious when completed. 😊 See you next time. ✨ 🌊 💨 ⛵️ 🏝️ 👙 🌞 ✨
I don't think so Tim .
BTW: Congratulations on gettin' y'alls keel wet!! Fair wind and tide~! TWStone
Hi guys! I have been following you all for years, first found you on facebook and I have really enjoyed your content and your journey soooo much and really enjoy that you have shared it with us! I am on pins and needles with you on getting Curiosity in the water and on more sailing adventures!!! Very exciting, you are getting so close!!!! Wooo hoooo!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
So happy for you guys. The waiting is even hard for us. We have been there when building a house.  You are doing a great job of staying busy and positive. Thank you for all the filming and hard work.
lol tooltime! Omg I can only imagine how frustrating delays must be at this time. So close to sea trials 😊 for good bikes look in a Dutch bike store they are the best bikes in the world! (Or I like to think so 😂)
She’s so gorgeous! (Nikki too of course… but this time I’m referring to the boat! ❤) ~R
One day at a time. We are not able to control everything in life, that is what makes it such a adventure.
Don’t put electric bikes on your boat.  One of your batteries exploded and burnt part of the boat.   It was just sitting on the deck!!   Not being charged just sitting there.    If you do electric keep the batteries in a fire proof bag.  But it is a known issue that electric bikes and scooters don’t like being around saltwater
That's the way ALL electrical hookups and wiring should look each and every time. Superb job. Reminds me of my navy days. If you wonder what exactly I'm talking about, look at any other boat's electrical area and you will immediately see the difference. Jason and nikki they did you right on this, no question
Of course we know Tim the Tooltime Taylor! As soon as he started grunting we knew what he meant :)
Lectric also make a" lite " version that is almost 1/2 the weight. And folding. And 3" knoby tires. 😊
Have two on my 44 monohull. Seat post/battery comes out and is a good portion of the weight and makes charging easy. ACTBEST Folding Electric Bike for Adults - 750W Brushless Motor Ebike, 48V 15AH Removable Battery
I love Tool Time
Have you looked at one wheel?  Not a bike, but smaller and get you farther than walking.
Don’t worry. I will be here next week and every week. 😊
Watching Victoria and Rico reviewing a superyacht to find two stoways in the engine room in Cannes was funny😂
Have you looked at the MiRiDER bike, 17.3 kg, folds down to 780mm x 690mm x 460mm, prices from £1,595.00 depending what accessories you add.
lol yeah the dishwasher
If you can somehow figure out how to fit Lectric bike, look at Engwe instead. It's the same frame but they have better wheels. I have Lectric 2.0 but if I knew what I know know, I'd go with Engwe.
Master Mariner here. Try Lectric bike 2.0 Light weight @ 40 some old lbs~! yours TW Stone...
We all know Tim "The Toolman"!  🙂  And most of us men at least can relate. 😉
Dishwasher!
Oh come on, everyone still remembers "Tim the tool man Taylor"... More power! OOHH oh oh! Love you guys, can't wait for all your delays to be in your past!
Congratulations on seeing your dream splash for the first time.
Get your visas sorted they cannot be renewed internally. they have very strict laws which could jeopardise ownership of your boat.  if you overstay. Riley of La Vagabond has huge issues.
Congrats on the boat finally splashing and I understand the frustration of the delays but better correct than rushed. Once the boat is finished and in the water you guys need to invite Tim Allen for a tour of the boat.
Of course we know Home Improvement. Can’t wait till your first voyage.
all good but  fault finding  will be fun when its all buttoned  up ???? hmmmmm guys
Instead of e bikes Get Commuter electric scooters. Thirty two fifty pounds Depending on range and you can just pick it up over rough terrain.
I'm surprised that it took them so long to figure out that on a sailboat, with panels near the mast, that they needed more MPPT controllers. Ideally 1 MPPT controller per panel. The long term cruisers knew that, they were required well over a decade ago. Although Cruisernet, has electrical engineers and ABS techs, who have contributed to the regs, over the years. Also, about ebikes. They are more prone to battery fires, than you would think. Research, research, research. Best wishes from the North.
Tim the Tool Man Taylor!!!!!!! Tool time! I’m only 22 years old and used to watch that show with my dad!
:)
I believe the best thing as far as compact and light and foldablity would be an Electric Scooter.  I have a little bag mounted on the front of the deck of mine which allows me to carry parts and the odd grocery run
Did I miss something?  No anti foul paint?
This may show my ignorance but why does it look like the bottom is unfinished ?
14:01  Try the Fiido M21 it has a great 500w motor on an ascent of 12% and 1 km I managed it at 20 km/h without breaking a sweat in the middle of July at 28°C and let's face it, I'm a "lazy guy" with no fitness in cycling the price is very reasonable for what they offer you can pedal, and it can also go like a scooter it is usually locked at 25kmh, but if you unlock it, it goes up to 50kmh I personally have Fiido M21, D11 and T1 pro
The Dishwasher! Woot!
I know Tim Allen, and Jason is getting a dishwasher, yay! Boat looks great!
I actually have a Tool Time hat.
hope you have budgeted for maintenance and repairs.  It looks like a very complex boat.

💜💜
Your episodes NEVER fail to leave us with anticipation of the next one. Fascinating process. I was intrigued by the stepp ed process of checking systems and installing panels in a particular and necessary order. Thanks for the invitation, looking forward to the next video. Be well Niki and Jason, real close to sailing this jewel on your own....can't wait for those episodes.
I feel your frustration with the delay.  Looking forward to seeing you back on the water.
Boy, I thought software development was bad when it came to delays, but it looks like boat development is just as bad or worse :(.  Bummer!!!  But you guys have a great attitude and you are almost to the end :).
Did you look at the lectric lite bikes?  Much smaller when folded but still can almost go anywhere.
All part of the process....hurry up and wait.
The Jack Rabbit is a cool e bike alternative, but no pedals.  They're not cheap, but a good alternative may be Carbo Model X...super super light, more compact than the lectric, belt drive (clean and less corrosion), but they aren't cheap...
Super wow.
Why no insulation? Black panels will soak up the heat then transfer into salon. Does that mean there is zero insulation in the boat? No insulation means condensation and mold in strange places.
Good to see you in the water!
Mazel tov!! Congrats!🎉🎉🎉🎉
IT WILL BE EASY TO SPOT YOUR BOAT WITH THE MINT GREEN HULL COLOR !  GEE ITS GREAT ! PERHAPS KILL TIME IN SHANGHAI ? OR JUST GO THRU THE PACES WATCHING PROGRESS AND LEARNING WHILE FOLLOWING PROGRESS ! NO BETTER TIME THEN NOW !  YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB !
Zack and Jessy on the "Now you Know" youtube channel has a segment called "Now let's review" and it's about electric folding bikes.
Sorry for the additional delays.  We feel your pain.  The important thing is that everything is done right.  It will be worth the wait.  Thanks as always for the great videos.  Cheers
At 21:20 everyone rushed to say drum roll please- Jason is going to be happy, a washing machine for dishes yeah.   Xiamen is beautiful. I really loved living in China.
finally starting to see it come together.. so exciting.. you going to need to invite Ricco and Victoria to film for their channel once it is in the water because it will be interesting to see another take on the finished product.
While you wait I suggest you rent both one wheels and powered unicycles. Both will work on dirt but the unicycles are better. I'm 76 and rode a one wheel in about 5 min. Seriously, should be good content also.
Tool Time was a show we never missed. :)
Flit foldable e-bikes are great. UK startup
I almost felt sorry for them having to wait a few more days to fit their carbon fibre mast to their new $10000000000000 dollar yacht. Then I felt resentment, then I felt that it’s disgraceful that people can fritter their lives away doing nothing more useful than trying to enjoy a never ending mission of self obsessed gratification.
My wife and I have those exact bikes (Lectric XP2.0) and we love them. With their 3" wide tires they are great for paths and unpaved roads. They will fit into 40 gallon totes and there are even canvas carry bags. But they are heavy (65lbs) and could be a pain loading and unloading from storage to a dinghy to a dock. If they fold then they need extra sturdy (heavy) frames. I'm sorry I don't have any experience to offer with smaller/lighter ebikes. But I think ebikes are definitely the way to go. One of your past episodes comes to mind where Jason schlepped a couple jerry cans to get gas only to be told they were sold out and he'd have to walk another mile to the next possible fuel source. I hope you can find something that fits. Maybe you could build, or have built, a bike rack somewhere? p.s. Tim, the Tool Man, Taylor! love the guy, loved Home Improvements.
Good and wonderful people who have been anything but kind, and loving with and for each other, to show the world, and patent deserve timely patience is an every learning process will only bring you closer as a couple. So even if the visa runs out, you'll find a captain and crew to meet at a 3'd country, and this too will work out. Niki, you got plenty of Captain friends who could pinch in when you need help. so call em if you need them.
I remember tool time!!😂 the new boat is looking quite amazing!
With size an issue, for an electric bike, you might want to consider a regular folding bike with something like a Boost Electric Bike Conversion Kit. You will also need to pay close attention to restrictions on power, throttles, etc. in countries you visit and not get something that will be illegal to ride where you are going.
Well done, look forward to seeing you guys on your own seaworthy boat, these are teething issues. You guys are great.
I can only imagine how excited you both must be.
It's the climate diezel that get algie problems, you can buy clean diezel in some places and it's a little more expensive, but it is around 30 % more effective than "climate friendly" diezel.
tim the tool man taylor
The last thing you should do is Rush the finishing of your new yacht ! Do it right the first time 😎👍
check out an e bike by jetson. small and compact.
#Tim Taylor hahaha
Brompton bikes?
Please tell me that Jason is getting a dishwasher!!!! Please, please, please pretty please!!!!
Why didn't silvin send a tech out to do the lines,  silvin CEO went out personally and did parley revival sales in Panama ?
Hi Jason I remember Tool Time. Especially the Tool Time Girl Pamela Anderson!  Mind you I am old as well! Currently on Disney Plus. Boat clocks great.
My guess would be that he finally beat you down and he got his dishwasher.
We have Lectric bikes and love them, BUT they are HEAVY so lifting them in an out of that space would be a no go. Seem’s like a non electric foldable might be a better choice?
Dishwasher is my guess too!!!!!
Anybody that’s ever built a house feels your pain and knows the disappointment of delays not to mention the expense. It’ll be worth it
Congratulations,  She is beautiful.  Looking forward to your future adventures in Curiosity.
As far as bicycles, there is a YOU TUBER who designs and flys state of the art airplanes. I know he uses trail bikes and they are part of his bush planes . Mike Pavey is his name. Great site, very informative, professional. and just a nice guy.
Why does the bottom look unpainted and unfinished? I don't understand that.
Why does the bottom of the boat seem to lack any anti-fouling?   I'm curious?
For the ultimate folding bike take a look at Brompton.  British built, there is a factory ebike version, you can get a belt drive with hub gear so no drivetrain to rust on the boat, you can get an offroad conversion (Kinetics MTBrompton) and finally, you can fit an aftermarket e-assist by Swytch.
Whoop whoop ❤❤ so stoked for you both ! ❤ from Auckland New Zealand 🇳🇿
Jason is RIGHT about BOTH the dishwasher and Tool Time Tim. As much as I might want to be on Team N,  I gotta back up Jason on this one.
Pretty trees in the background at the end 😊
No matter what you two do in an episode it is fun to watch. Just where you live, or what you do when you get there is always interesting. So thank you for sharing your journey with us.
I got you Tim. They should have installed Binford for you.
Tooltime! Loved that show! It was also broadcasted in the Netherlands back in the day
All of get the reference to Tim the Toolman Taylor
Had to watch this first thing this morning because it was in the water. And bonus....DISHWASHER incoming!!! So with being this close....how soon before you put the order in for the 60 footer? 😆😆😆
Tool Time👍
Woop Woop... Goodonyas!
Just that little bit bigger and that what she said lol 😅😊
I FEEL SHE IS THE FIRST OF MANY HOMES YOU WILL CALL YOUR OWN🌈🌎❤️❤️😍😍🛡️🛡️ YOU TOOK SUCH EXCELLENT CARE OF YOUR FIRST CAT MABE A SUPER MOTORYACHT WITH CURIOSITY AS YOUR TENDER IS IN THE NEAR FUTURE 😁😁💋💋 A MEGAYACHT WITH TWO EXCELLENT CAPTAINS IS FITTING FOR YOU GUYS!!!!! 🌈🌎❤️😁💎💎 AS USUAL MOST EXCELLENT TO SEE THE UPDATE TODAY💋💋🛡️🛡️❤️❤️😁😁
How come the hulls look unpainted and kinda weird going in the water?  I would have thought that was all done prior to going into the water.  Look forward to your next show.  Merry Christmas
Jason, You have to break a bottle of champagne on her for good luck. On the boat not Nikky.
https://www.youtube.com/@nowletsreview6700
What is all over the bottom it looks like paper and tape not smooth.
I know Tim Allen.
Consider some of the new off-road capable electric scooters if you can't find a suitable e-bike.
What Binford model would the PV panels be?
Look at the Jupiter X5 or X7.
Soon. Soon!  I am so excited for you and cannot wait until you get back to onboard adventuring with your new beautiful home. It will be amazing.  “Oh. The places you’ll go.”
Fantastic we're getting the dishwasher.
Did someone say ebikes? 😊 Would the Lectric XP Lite work?
Will you be getting some kitty cats ?
Congrats! I don’t view this as the beginning of the end, I see it as the end of the beginning!
Congratulations
I love my Brompton folding bike. I’ve used it hundreds of miles on numerous surfaces, including cobblestone. The frame is a beast and can handle anything.
Life is a test. It's all in the way you respond. You both are doing well. At least now you get too produce an extra video. The ending of this one is beautiful and actually would have loved to se more of the area. Cheers
more power.
jason got the dish washer
The Lectric XP Lite won’t work?
You got to know Tim! 😂
Don’t want to be Debbie downer but my experience has been things take twice as long if the owner is there and 4 times as long if they help.
Tim the Tool Man Taylor - oh oh oh!!  More power!!  Loved the show.  So happy to see your boat on the water. Love the teal color.  So excited for you and I do understand the frustration of waiting some more. Hope all goes well on your first cruise out for testing. Thanks so much for showing the beauty in China.
Congrats Nikki and Jason on another major milestone! All these delays will be quickly forgotten once you move aboard and start sailing in the sunset 🌅
Dear Jason and Nikki, Congrats on this most crucial of all milestones: perfect flotation! She looks STUNNING! I hear your frustration and sense your months of inner exhaustion, from anticipating her birth and yet, despite your readiness, she's gonna be born when she is ready, not when anyone else is ready. But that's the beauty of it!! It will ALL cone true, and all be worth it! Meanwhile, luckily you two are incredibly practiced at unpredictable waiting. It's one of your superpowers! You're just stuck in the world's most unpredictable weather window right now, waiting to depart, but the weather keeps changing, and it's all out of your control. May you draw on your inner strength! It's expectation -- the set up and the disappointment -- that makes it so emotionally exhausting to you. For us? We're just here for the ride, and we're not going anywhere. So *please* don't worry about pleasing anyone other than yourselves! May you just do what you need to do to take care of you. Sending support and all the positive energy from across the world. ❤Lee
Beautiful Boat, I’ve been waiting patiently too. I’m liking your decisions on choices. Excited for the adventures you all will be taking. I’ll be staying tuned for your next video
Dishwasher!
Lots of replacement water filters.  Always a good idea.
Tim "The Toolman" Taylor!  Good times
Holy smokes! That color is absolutely stunning in the water.
88' looks good to me, so happy for you both and your new boat which you've worked so hard for. Well done!! 🎉 Your sensibilities have gotten you to where you are, Congratulations!! ❤
We know Tim!
Congratulation 🎉. I absolutely love the hull color!
The wait is almost over. Stay strong. Stay positive. You need a Wilson over the fence giving you moral support.
She floats!! ❤
Not sure if this was suggested but can the bikes be broke down further?  Such as removing wheels or handlebars?
Trust the process. Too much drama.
I have an Evelo Dash folding electric bike.  I selected it because it is a folding bike that weighs ~47 lb, has mid motor, rear axel 5 speed transmission, and gates belt.  Very clean and relatively easy to get into a car trunk.Tires are multipurpose tread (between street and dirt) and mid size.  I enjoy riding it and throwing it into the car to go riding elsewhere.
is the bottom not being painted?
Jason, I believe electric has a new lighter version of their bike, you might want to watch camper van Kevin, he lives near them and is a sponsor and if I remember he showed a newer version of it.
Sweet boat but not onboard with the hull color, looks like something Kitchenaid has on a stand mixer.
Electric has a Lite Ebike. That may work
How can they afford this? It's not like they are LA Vagabonde? They must come from rich family, I guess.
Tool Time!!!
i will bet the big debate item is a dishwasher :D
Please get a good USA or European surveyor to inspect the entire boat!
Thank you for the episode.  Like everyone else, I can't wait for new episodes.  Looking forward to the sea trials and all of your future "blue water cruising" adventures.  Keep the videos coming!
I’d rather have a trash compactor instead of a dishwasher. So would my wife. About a month ago, in the Med, an e-bike go wet with a saltwater bath. It was left in the aft cockpit after a rinse.  During the night it caught fire and the fire spread rapidly. There were three on board. The wife died, the father was severely burned and the son  was hospitalized as well. The boat was a total loss. I don’t think that I would keep in locker where saltwater could intrude!
😂😂 the tooltime grunt/laugh!! I knew immediately what he was doing 😂😂   Congratulations ❤
We have been patient, show off that beauty!
Congratulations!
Electric bikes-please research that carefully I have seen examples of the batteries exploding and or catching on fire and people who had them in storage sheds or their garages had lots of damage from the fires because they are difficult if not impossible to put out the fire caused by the electric batteries just like the fires in electric cars that are impossible to put out. As I think about this do you have different types of fire extinguishers on your boats for electric fires specifically??????
It’s so cute ! Haha
That solar system is definitely a Binford 6100.
👍🏼oh boy, oh boy it’s happening 🎉 congratulations 🎈
Beutifull,health n wealth to you both in your new home.
I was looking at folding electric bikes for our airplane. I was really interested in the CARBO model X because it's so light. They're less than 30 pounds each. I haven't bought one yet, but might be interesting to look at.
Yup ..I know Tool Time Tim .. hahah
TOOL TIME 💪🏻👍🏻
Tool time.  Yesss
electric unicycles are the bomb. must learn to ride yet so suitable for catamaran size wise
E-bike Gyrocopters Frost Electric City Bike | 350 W Motor | 14-inch Tires | Speed up to 25kmph | Battery Range up to 30km | Dual Shocks | Compact Folding Ebike Amazon for under $600 Canadian and very compact and lightweight.
Home Improvement (Tool Time) is the second greatest show ever, closely following Gone with the Wynns ❤
I watch reruns of Tool Time daily followed by Last Man Standing love Tim Allen!
Yes!! Tool time
Me thinks a dishwasher is in Jason's future🤞🤞🤞😀 As with everything the timing is teasing you. I hope there is no need to redo visas. As always,  thrilled for you two lovely people and hope there are no more setbacks and as they say  'all smooth sailing'  ahead. I'm eager for next weeks post. ❤❤❣
you should name it 2 fast 2 curious as its the second curiosity lol
Of course we know “Tim the Toolman Taylor”!
Omg, I’m so excited for you guys! Also…why am I nervous?!?
I noticed no props or bottom paint so then realized the process is ongoing. I was able to watch the commissioning of our new monohull sailboat back in the day. A very interesting and exciting process indeed. Congratulations and glad to see they are making sure everything is done correctly.
Of course we know the Tim the Tool Man Taylor lol.  But I am older than Jason 😂
So great to see it finally in the water. Exciting times.
She’s looking fabulous.  Beautiful colour.
Quite honestly,I don't think I would get anything,or buy anything,made in Asia,seems they really don't know what the hell they are doing,why launch a boat when it's no even finished,don't know what's on the hull,doesn't even look like it painted???????
Tool time!
Doesn't everyone know Tool Time?
I'm betting the big one that's been a big debate is a dishwasher!!
We started with travel trailers and are now building a boat, pretty much because of you guys. We took your advice to heart and have learned to sail and are building up our miles and skills before we pick up our own boat. Great to see how this whole process is unfolding. Took last week’s break as an opportunity to go back and watch your first couple of months of sailing videos- how far you have come!
How do you avoid  E-Bike Battery Fires on a fiberglass boat? Don't  bring one on board, Rent the ebike.   Aternative to buying a folding bike, buy a ebike you can disassemble, remove the front tire or both tires, handlebars, peddles, seat, baskets., battery and store parts about the boat.
I have a HONBIKE (folding shaft-driven e-bike). Might work well for your boat.
You should have gotten the Binford 2000 Invertor.
If you haven't yet, check out the Brompton electric bike. It will address the size and weight concern. But probably not the wheel and cost concern. But it's a folding bike brand that has been around for decades.
No bottom paint?
'Howdy neighbour '. Tim 'The Toolman' Taylor, great show for sure. Loving the colour of the boat especially when the water is reflected in it 👍
So excited to see her on the water!  I have a question about the cabinets. I hope I’m not repeating someone but didn’t see it in the comments. You say how lightweight and strong they are. I am curious about one thing. In rough seas, will they hold up to an elbow or knee hitting them hard? I’m sure you’ve thought of that but didn’t see reference to that specific issue.
Thank you for sharing your life with us. Thank you for your positive attitude no matter what happens.
YES,  that question,  IS Jason getting his  dishwasher installed on this BOAT?  thanks for sharing.
Electric bikes are in their infancy, I think.  They are ever changing and improving at the moment.  Would you consider holding off and instead of electric, purchase a Bike Friday or another folding bike until you really find the electric bike that you would like to have?  Thanks for another great episode.  Congratulations on your new floating home😊
Forsuch a big comppany to make these mistakes on new design or not feels unacceptable im half thru can imagine your feelings
Congratulations on the progress, and what a beautiful city.  Would love to see more of it, before your boat is ready, if you are able to freely film in it.
Oh my, more delays! You just hav3 to be at your wits end with this long awaited process. Seeing Curiosity II finally get her bottom wet was so exciting but not the almost stepping of the mast! One would have double checked those stay connections Before the process rather than discovering the error at this point!  No matter, she looks beautiful and I will be waiting for your next posting.
Love Tim the Tool man Taylor - almost better than you guys !!!!
09:30 Mast. Black. Carbon? Wow!
Tim the toolman taylor what a show & never saw anything but the neighbours hat  haaaa  i dont know what agei wasbut hadme lol the guy  ouldnt getit right
So I’m guessing you caved and Jason got his dishwasher! LOL… I’m thinking people who have never commissioned a new boat are think….shrouds to long, really! When I commissioned my last boat ( 43 ft monohull ) it was so much work to organize…..I lost 10 lbs during the commissioning and  lots of sleep!
Hey Jason. I bought the Lectric 3.0 a few months back, with the same idea of eventually storing it in a sailboat and using it to expand the range of day-trips on islands (so much of the bigger islands are inaccessible when you travel by boat!!). It seemed great on paper, but did not shape up in reality. I recently sold it for a few major reasons: 1. These things are crazy heavy!  I weigh 193lb and am pretty fit. I couldn’t imagine trying to load it on and off a dinghy. That process would be a nightmare (for your back and just plain dangerous). 2. They don’t really get that small. Even folded, I couldn’t fit it in the bed of my F150 with the tonneau cover closed. I know space on a boat is at a premium, I would hate to see the opportunity cost on that space you take up. 3. You get what you pay for. This is on the lower price range of e-bikes and it shows a bit. They are heavy (as mentioned) and some of the components show it too. Particularly the brakes. They were mechanical breaks on my version (I’ve heard they are switching to hydraulics), and they were the most embarrassingly loud brakes I’ve ever heard (like rolling up on a steam train haha). 4. The tires make it seem like it’s meant for off road, but the weight, low ground clearance, and bad suspension made it comical when trying to use it as a mountain bike (it felt like it was falling apart and my wife was smoking me on her dual suspension regular mountain bike). So there are the reasons I would highly advise that you don’t go down that route. My recommendation instead? I would encourage one of the two: 1. I non-e-bike folding bike. You’ll still get extended range from the foot-equivalent, you’ll get exercise, and they will be MUCH more portable. 2. If you are really set on an e-bike, spend the money and get the gocycle that you referenced. It will be usable because it is light and folds up small. It will do fine on dirt roads, just hike the more gnarly trails. You’ve got this super fancy boat, don’t skimp on the toys ;). Happy to talk about it more if you’d like. Just reach out and maybe we can do a call.
That was exciting.
Re: Electric Bicycles…… you’re in China! That’s where most of everything gets made! Ask your boat guys for recommendations. You’ll have lots to choose from.
Curiosity II is beautiful!! I love the color. It will be so exciting to see her with mast and sails!!! ❤️
Cliff hangers🤣🤣  cannot wait to see Jason's dishwasher✌️💜
Hoping it's a dishwasher and yes I knew the home improvement reference 😊
What kind of solar panels do these boats use? I’ve never seen flexible solar panels without that little bulge were all the wires and connector comes out. But there’s are complete flat!!
🤞🏻 hoping for the best for you at every stage of this exciting and tantalizing process!
I think you lost out by not getting the Victron's.
Have an electric bike that folds, but they are quite heavy and may be a problem to maneuver into a tight space.
Home improvement was one of the best shows!!!
Yes, Tim the tool man is great. Shhhh not my age, older. lol😂 Bummer 🤞 ❤️🇨🇦
For a small foldable e-bike take a look at Pedigo Latch.
quick question? No bottom paint??
Personally I would have went for a 55 instead of the 44. In less than a year on the water I bet you will wish that to.
Do you guys get system design and dimensioned drawings for your boat?
15:15 check out "Switch bike".....you can turn any bike into an Ebike. what I understand, as simple as changing out the front wheel.
Big Tim rules ! ! ! !
Tool Time! Binford Tools Tim Allen Awesome!
I have a question about the whisper wall. From the looks of it, it is cloth stretched over a cavity.  My question is, what happens if you have mold growing in the material.  How easy is it to clean?  From they way they were installing it, it didn't look easy to take down and throw in the washing machine.  It also looked a little flimsy to wash in place.  Just thinking about what happens if you leave the boat for a few months, to travel back to the USA, and you come back to a moldy boat.
A watched catamaran never boils?
Of course I know “ Tim the tool man”….but I’m 77!
So, I am compensating for my own second-hand frustration with your boat construction AND my own struggle with dark, rainy, northern, coastal winter by going back to the start of your journey with buying Curiosity and then just running that playlist all the way through.  So lucky to have that archive.  Much love to you both.  Hang in there.   ❤️🎄❄️🥂🐳
HASA has has Halo folding e-bike but I am not sure of the tire size. Good luck.
More Power, More Power. Too much power is something anyone with solar has never said.
1:58 Looks like a broken glass before they are putting it in the water
Ebike is great if you want to loose the boat through fire. Otherwise not.
Congratulations to you both welcome to the world q2 🎉🍾🥂
Yes on Tim the Tool Time..... But please do not give anything more power Tim. Do not forget the right size chair so when you are sailing inside your can see as Ruby Rose did not have a right height for her to see out the front window and get headphones with mic.
I'm so stupid - I thought the boat name stayed with the boat and you had to find a new name for the new boat.
@21:00 The dishwasher! Yay! Jason has been liberated 😅
Following this build and your journey through the years has been so much fun. I look forward to waking every Sunday and getting watching the Wynn's!! Happy sailing & calm seas!
unfortunate about delay, but maybe it's meant to be. About shelves light weight are they still strength durable?  I guess someone screwed up with there measurements with mask, I am sure H&H will come to the rescue. I hope they will be compensating you for your delay. Looking forward to next video.
LETRIC 3.0 folding bike. We have 2. They are good quality, good for dirt off road. They offer a great basket system for hauling groceries. For the location you're looking to store them in, they weigh 65 lbs and are heavy to lift and lower into a location like you plan to use. A hoist or block and tackle would be awesome. I have used my SUV for hauling them. They are fairly heavy to lift. I saw where someone bought plastic tubs large enough to put one bike in and used the tub to handle them. My opinion.... They would be a perfect bike for you with the baskets, but lifting them in and out of the compartment will be difficult. Note that when you add a front basket, they Will not fold quite as small.
Oh ya. Tim the tool man!  Was a great show 😊👌🏽
So excited with you, to see the boat in the water, so disappointed that you are being delayed once again. But all good things come to those who wait, and wait, and wait. 😂 Christmas in your new home?
Keep going guys , I just love your videos and look forward to see you back in the water .
❤ GR8 VID ❤ LOVED IT ❤ The TEAL color is gorgeous and a great contrast to the gorgeous mustard yellow of the new La Vagabond trimaran. I suspect the bottom of the boat hasn't got its final coat of paint or jell and those 3 little yellow strips on the hauls will be gone soon. All in all the color & design with that long black section in the haul is simply gorgeous. Its going to be awesome to watch the next years how well this boat sails ❤ so glad to be a Patreon supporter myself and hope more & more subscribe, view, comment AND support you guys ❤
I know Tool Time. Lol
There are always unforeseen problems and challenges, but you will get through them.  The boat is looking great and soon you will be on the open seas.
Skipping last week made me sad.
Splash day!  Super excited for you, all your adventures ahead and lucky us who get to partake in them from afar.  Congratulations.
As long as Jason gets his dishwasher everything will be great,the boat is looking great 🎉🎉
Enjoy these moments and delays as those you'll remember the most. My wife and I watched your journey every Sunday, unfortunately she passed to pancreatic cancer in June and couldn't see your finish. Enjoy your adventure together and thanks for sharing.
You don’t have lots of toys like kites, paddle boards etc so get the off road bikes! You guys overthink simple things like dishwashers and bikes! Just make it work! And video tip you were too hard to hear over the workers, very distracting
A Dishwasher. I knew it.  Love you guys. See you next week. 🎉
I know Tim but I'm also 48 years old
Very sexy boat!
We love y'all ❤ the good stuff takes time 🎉 and this is the BEST stuff 🎉
You two continue to prove that virtually anyone can have a YouTube sailing channel.
The biggest mistake are the electric unproven motors.  Time will tell and you will regret!
As I was watching you talk about electric bikes an add came on talking about Fiido X folding electric bike lol maybe they have something that would work!
Great Tim Taylor reference, We almost grunted at the same time 😁
Home Improvement was such a great show! Love Tim the Tool man
Why does the bottom of the boat look like it is not completely painted??   Looks likes lots of patches on the bottom.
Why does the hull below the waterline look so crappie?
Oh no! Does knowing what Jason is talking about make me old? Yeah, Tim the Toolman Taylor!!
Contact the bike company for the bikes you like. Maybe they can find or build a solution for you (i e. - revised foldable bike model).
Fingers crossed
My guess is a dishwasher!
love the color!!
Lectric has had significant issues with their brake systems I would steer away from that brand….
In terms of seriously looking to bring a couple of electric-assist bikes onboard, start with bikes that have been fully tested and certified. So many of these Chinese imports have chosen not to complete the proper UL certification. Also, as you travel around the globe, make sure you are selecting a company that can supply you with replacement parts shipped to wherever you land. So many of the Chinese importers have limited access to replacement parts and often the factory changes elements that render the original version obsolete without telling anyone.  Reach out to any of the companies you are looking at and ask if they support if they support the UL 2849 system certification. While you are at it, unless the bike is being delivered in someone's car, ask if they have full UNDOT 38.3 safe transport certification. These are the elements you will need to keep your boat safe from lithium challenges. Unless things have changed, I do not believe that Lectric has completed the UL certification process, for their Chinese drives and batteries.
We got 2 gocycles on our outremer 45 and we often do 50-90 km on eco and don’t drain the batteries. They sell great storage bags and we find them very comfortable. Super happy with ours and wouldn’t change. Tires not off road but hold up fine
The closer it gets, the harder it's gonna be. You all have been "homeless" for too long!
Figure out out to do the E bikes, built solid.  💐💐💐🧜‍♀️👙🙏👍😎🦅🇺🇸
You should have gone with the BINFORD 2000 controllers. MORE POWER UUUGGHH UUUGGHH UUUGGHH 🛠🛠🛠
Limbo living is always such a challenge.  I’ve experienced it a few times in my 77 years and I now know it was a teaching/learning time for me. I admire the way you two are handling it all with such grace and putting it to good use. So very eager to see the next step! I’ve been following you since your very early RV days and it’s always been a joy. Peace to you both. ❤
OMGosh you guys she looks so stunning in the water!!!  Tryyyyy to enjoy yet another break while you wait...but those dang Visas- ugh! It will be such a great gift for us to see her outfitted.  Btw ... you guys look great.
Looks like you might have enough space for a tern ebike. They dont fold in half but they fold so they end up being super narrow.  Definitely seem beefier and cheaper than a go cycle.
Tool Time with Tim was everything! Sorry for the delay! I can’t wait to be virtually sailing with you guys!
Great to see the boat near completion. Looks fabulous and I know you both are excited for all your future adventures. Enjoy!
Rad makes a good ebike.
Hi Kids as we are seniors, we have watched your videos since you sold everything and purchased your RV and hit the roads. We always fallow you guys for your boating as we are boaters ourselves but power boating. Just wanted to give you some info for your electric bikes as we have 2 20 in Dahon foldable bikes and I put a DYI electric kit on them. They work great for us as we tour our islands of western Canada off Vancouver Island.  I just recently build a lift to place them on and off our boat. Now what is great is the batteries are removable and I place them in  explosion proof bages for storage.  One thing you have to be concerned regarding electric bikes catching fire as I have been told of a few that happened in a retailers store here in Canada. If you would like pics of our bikes and my brake down hoist I built, send us an email and I will send you a couple. By the way love the new boat HH.
if you know you know (Home improv)
I Loved that show! Odd fact: Pamela Anderson was a tool girl in the early season Tool Time!
Congrats! Instead of Bicycle, maybe one wheelers or Segway?
Hey Jason don't worry about getting older just be true to yourself.  Nikki can stay 21if she wishes!
their over laughing is annoying
It’s so exciting being this close. Can’t wait until you’re back on the water full time.
Patience is a virtue, and you definitely want this boat right.
I know the intent is not to use the engines. I do recommend a run schedule based on manufacturers' recommendations. ENGINES are designed to run, not sit idols, especially when exposed to so much atmospheric moisture. Needing your engine and finding out it's seized would not be fun in the middle of the ocean.
MOAR POWER!!!! *grunt*.  You guys need to slap a Binford tools sticker on something!
Get Carbo bikes
I have a RAD Expand 5 folder - but I think that it may be in the same size/weight class as the Lectric. ebikes are going to be heavy. No free lunches. The batteries can be removed and stored elsewhere for some weight savings, but the overall size won'[t change.
Beautiful Creation, Very intense.
AG1????  😂
Have you thought about an electric Unicycle (EUC)? Compared to a bicycle, they fit in a small space, you can drive even on bad roads, the range is superior... Of course, they do require a couple of hours of learning, but I recommend you try them while you are there, they are all made there.
Exciting times guys.. nice job
Oh yeah I remember Tim 'the tool man' Taylor, but then again I'm super old (62).   The dishwasher's going in I'll bet. That's been such a big debate, but I'm happy for Jason. I have a Lectric bike and LOOOOOVE it!  I can fold it up and carry it in my class C motorhome.  I hope you find a place to fit one (or one like it).  Ebikes are fun and efficient.  Hope the time passes quickly until you're back to sailing and in your happy place.
Everyone knows Home Improvement. I still quote that show weekly.
😂 tool time 😂
Justice for Jason... yes, I know Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor from Home Improvement!  Sorry about the boat delay!
Yes, to Tim Allen!  That was a blast from the past!
the paint color is the same color as Jason's eyes!
What was the reason to change from Victron to Gensun?
Urrr urrrr urrrr MORE POWER!  Of course we know Tim he is a legend….
🇨🇦
The Binford 9000 of MPPT solar controllers right there in all its glory for more power...oh oh oh (grunting) yes!
Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys choose a different mast that what was on hull 1 or what was the reason the rigging (I know you said shrouds too long) didn't work?
Jason get the Lectric XP LITE, they're awesome. We have two of them, they're light, simple and compact. We regularly get 20 to 30 miles range out of ours and they're inexpensive to boot ($800)
If no one has mentioned about bicycles. Brompton electric!
Go ahead and get yourself a set of those whisper wall tools they are using.  I know the idea is that the whisper walls should not have to be removed.  But it's a boat.  You will eventually have to remove and replace everything.
Brompton Electrics.  Ask Nick and Terysa about Brompton bicycles.
Love this show ,awesome boat,not Hers not His ,but ours,Neil Young "Love is a rose ",but you better not pick it ,it only grows when its on the vine,hand full of thorns and you know you missed it you loose that love when you say the word MINE
Can't wait to see y'all out on that pretty pretty cat!!!
You might want to consider electric scooters for space and weight savings rather than bikes.  There are several high quality heavy duty off road options you might want to check out.  Easy to operate and very mobile.
Spectacular!
Tool Time!!! Missed yall last week.
That sure is a pretty yacht! Love that color. Congrats on the dishwasher Jason!!! Niki already had one though... LMFAO
Incredible things are worth the wait…as always, your camera work, personalities, editing and music choices made this video wonderful!
We really enjoy our XP3 by Lectric, but the light version is much lighter and is very nice.
You well get there but how frustrating great to see you back love you Guys ❤
Loved Tool Time! Get an Lectric model that is less weight but add 3" tires. They are out there  keep looking. Espin builds them too good luck
Tool time. 'Course we remember. As a 62 year old! Lol. Gilligan's Island, anyone?
Everyone knows Tim the Tool Man Taylor — nice impersonation!
E bikes are heavy… remove batteries before storing to save weight… store batteries in another area… e bikes require heavier frames even if aluminum … it’s the nature of the beast.  Consider keeping e bikes in main cabin area at center of boat… I have three e-bikes… my newest is even heavier… the bigger the motor and battery needs heavier frame and harder to lift … takes two people to lift into my pickup truck. Then you add accessories like cargo racks, bags and lights.  E bikes need to be an early design consideration in boats and rv’s … getting off dock into the boat is nerve wracking… lowering into storage areas is a fools errand. Best if driven straightaway to cabin of salloon
I know Tim Taylor, Jason. However, I am 42 years old...so we watched the same shows as kids. Lol
Congratulations on the progress and sorry you have to endure more delays.
Tim the Toolman! Every kid knows the growl as all dads do it! It lives on.
I'm starting to understand why boats are so expensive.
Man waiting is the hardest part. Good luck
I’m sorry you had to wait. I can see the stress in your eyes when you are talking about it. The boat is beautiful and will be yours soon enough, enjoy the journey. Merry Christmas from Kershaw South Carolina USA.
"Big Debate"?  Just give the man his Dishwasher already. 🤣
I've got a feeling that Jason's about to get his Dishwasher!
Lol everyone knows Tool Time, even my EU hubby 😂
So so close! I am still in love with the colour you chose for the hull. Holy moly it's good!  Sorry to see that there are delays, but I guess these things can and will happen. Hang in there. But saying that , even though its unpleasant and it complicates your life with extra logistics and heartache,  its clear to see your mindset about these delays is correct and your heads are in the right place. It It goes without saying, but its worth it for me to say, and others will agree, that you are doing amazingly well!  Cheering you along from the side lines here, Cheers T!
I work in technology, for a NAS I would recommend a Synology unit.  Synology has a feature called SHR (Synology Hybrid RAID).   Normal RAID you need matched drives for it to work properly, SHR you can use drives of various size and it just works.  You might also be able to fit a micro desktop down there which would be much more powerful than your laptops.  I am not talking about a NUC which is the same power of an average laptop but rather something like a Falcon Northwest Tiki.  A true desktop would significantly improve the render times for your video editing.
LOVE Tool Time!!!
Its not finished inside?  No paint on the bottom? I will zip it and watch the video. LOL Okay, I guess this is just a leak test. Yep, no where near finished.
What is the draft with the non-retractable dagger boards? Hope the fridge/freezer are universally available, after market units! Custom units screwed your last boat. _______ Edit note. Boat needs two cats!!!!!
ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
LECTRIC is the best IMO.  They make a LITE version
I have a folding bicycle for storage purposes. It has to fit in the dinghy. There must be a mountable electric motor and battery system.
If I wasn’t familiar with the launch process from @sketchtosea I would have been freaking out myself.  Sorry to hear of snafu with the mast.
..oh and thank you for not apologizing for the background noise....   ;)
I'd be a nervous wreck.
E bike and a trailer for a bike.cosr $89 for the trailer. It ways 25 lbs comes a rain proof cover. On 16in wheels.i have one fore my bike. It's a 27 .5 in. 15:36 🎉 bike .
lectric XP they make a light virgin that you can fit in there. The tires are thinner and it's lightweight. I have their bike. They're actually very good. I highly recommend you stay with them, get their light version model
Oh man!! That bites that the shrouds were to long. wow.
She’s a gorgeous boat! Sorry to hear of the delay…again.
I have had a 4"x20" tire'd foldable Heybike Mars.....  45#s w/o the battery, plus... and this is huge, the battery is easily removable.  the 4" tires means it will handle all terrains. It has a 300# capacity and the seat extends higher than other models for us tall guys.
When it comes to having bikes on board for island travel your current narrow-wheel bikes aren't providing the best stability and safety on un questionable roads.  The bike needs to be foldable for both storage and more importantly transportation on your dingy.  IMO you need to look at a foldable/20" FAT tire bike that provides city/rural road transportation and has cargo capability.  I can't speak to every brand but Rad E-Bike is the market leader in the commute E-Bike category.  Look at the  RadExpand 5 Electric Folding Bike.  It has cargo capability and fat tires for safer travel on rural roads.  The other great thing about RAD is they produce parts to service the bike!  The only issues of concern are shipping international and distribution rights etc...
2 weeks?  We have to wait 2 weeks! 😵Oh OK I see...whew!  Beautiful videography Jason!
tool time babyyyy I’m only 25 and home improvement was my favorite as a kid 😂you are not alone Jason!!!!!
Congratulations 🎉
Moar power RRR... Yup I'm old too
Dang that boat is sexy! Sure its been stressful as all heck but you are almost there then you got years of wonderful sailing ahead of you!
It's gonna be alright.
I remember Tim the Toolman Taylor. Are they going to finish painting the hull?
What a gorgeous boat
I work for a custom fab shop. It is tempting to focus on the one thing going wrong, but there are hundreds (thousands?) of things going right. Also, it is better to address the issues with the mast/rigging in the shop than literally anywhere else.
I say leave Jason alone with his Tim the Toolman Taylor grunt! It’s cute! He’s excited!
Loving the boat. On the subject of folding bikes, have a look at Brompton. A UK co and probably one of the most compact as they fold into 3 so fold down to around 24x24x12 approx. I have a 3 speed manual which comes in at around 12.5kgs, but they also do a range of electric and are just as compact, all be it a little heavier. If you want the ultimate they also do an almost fully titanium version at 7.45kgs but that's mega bucks.
I’m glad the headline wasn’t…she sinks she sinks😂
cmooooonnn, we know the toolman
LOVED the tool man reference at 13:00 😂
Tool Time all the way! Watching the boat hit the water, I don't know if my nerves could have handled it 🙃
Tool Time!!!  Man Grunt FTW!!!
maybe your getting to enthralled with this "electric" everything. You 2 are in shape, get regular Mt bikes. Cheaper, lighter and less problems.
I know Tool Time, but I'm 71 .........
Hurry up and wait.
It has to be a dishwasher!!!
Everybody knows Tim. Come on. Love the reference 🤩
Beautiful boat! From the video It looks like bottom paint is not applied.  Is she coming back out?  Or is it just how it appears on the video?
It’s Toooool Time!
I thought your catamaran was getting retractable dagger boards?
FYI Oddly enough that tree @19:32 is actually called an Orchid Tree (Bauhinia variegata) member of the Fabacea (pea family .... bean) and is native to Southeast Asia.....so you perfectly described it without even knowing
Have you guys looked at the Lectric XP Lite model?  It is about 25ish pounds lighter than their regular model and only one gear...may be perfect for island travel.
Beautiful! and yes, Tim the tool man Taylor.
❤❤❤❤❤my life has been empty without the Wynns
More power! Ho ho ho ho. I’m with ya, Jason. Missed you guys last week. Hope the mast gets installed this week.
Has to be a dishwasher, right?
Hey what the lightning strike protection system, what have you done about that ??? So lightning doesn't fry all those electronics.
Beautiful, but the color will blend in to some waters, making it less visible.
We are all so excited with you!  Sorry about the delay but the wait will be worth it!  She is beautiful!
Hello, explore the Varla Eagle Pro electric scooter. It is an all-terrain scooter, with 45 miles range per charge and up to 45 mph speed. They also have a seat that can be added. No pedals though. Just a thought.
Yay 🎉 I’ve been anxiously waiting for the video 👏
Be careful with making that shaky face.. lol
a gizillion times better colour than vegabonde III
Foldable ebike: Aventon Sinch.2 Don't know about weight or size requirements, but they look good. Congratulations on the progress with the new boat. Almost there!
So many things to track and check.  Oh my!,   I purchased my first NEW off road travel trailer last May.   It is hard to understand how many little things get over looked and system failures.  I had one 360 amp  lithium battery fail, and a propane regulator fail.  Other issues include just lack of quality control of the workers with items just not installed well.  Just part of the process but.  Looking forward to your future sailing adventures someday soon.
I know Tool Time!!!!!!
After being around sailboats for 50+ years, life is always a lot of plan B's.  Sorry about the extra stress but  your showing us the good, bad, and the ugly is the real story and an interesting one.  Thanks for sharing and oh yes, the tool guy!
Beautiful boat.❤
“Compact, electric, lightweight” - yeah, three specs - - please choose any two. Just drop the electric part and pedal away. After all that time on a boat, you might need the cardio/exercise. At worst, if you buy non-electric, you can always upgrade if you hate the choice. Congrats on floating your boat! Exciting times are near!
Whoot Whoot ... Happy for you both !!
Tim Taylor forever!
Nikki the first step to acceptance is acknowledgment. It would be healthy for you to acknowledge that you will have a dishwasher and Jason won this little battle. Ha sucks to be Jason with the next battle though.
version beta
Right on! Congratulations on this next big phase. Hoping Santa delivers for you guys and you're back out on the water by New Year's Eve. ✌️❤️🌎🎄
Tool time was awesome!
TOOL TIME!!!
Get something with a belt drive.  You don't want to be  futzing around with keeping a chain oiled and rust free.    I don't have any specific recommendations for a brand or model, but minimizing exposed drive train parts is going to make a big difference to for maintenance.
I have been waiting for this day for a very long time to see Curiosity in the water. So happy for you Nikki and Jason ☺
Am I late to the party? The weight issue of the eBikes would be better if they were stored aft? Is there a way to fit them on the aft deck? Removable batteries would be easier I would think. I've seen them in vids, burst into flames, so in the forward lockers that could be dangerous. Just spit balling.
What about a scooter instead of bikes?
First things first - I know it’s more delays, but congratulations on getting in the water! That’s a big step forward, and nice to get a small extra window to do extra bits like getting those bins right.  I feel your pain (in a much, much smaller way) as I’m also in temp accommodations for the past month and thought I’d move into a permanent spot before Christmas to get settled for the next 3.5 years, all booked for 20th Dec!…but final inspection didn’t go well so I am back to looking in a tight market again.  My new plan is to go home for Christmas holidays and leaving the things I have in the office, and waiting even longer for the truck and more than 1 suitcase of clothes and minimal work stuff (and a small bag as I’ve had to go shopping here to deal with earlier than expected snow…my proper cold gear is also on the truck).  So I absolutely feel your pain. But baby steps forward as I have time to receive my bank cards now, and have 3 viewings booked Mon/Tuesday…. And I am a fan of Tim the tool man Taylor too!  We enjoyed that on our side of the Atlantic as well😀🚧🛠🚒. Someone I worked with at home had an electric Brompton, the battery pack sat on the front so can be easily removed and it folds, but I don’t know if it’s what you are looking for - but probably at least worth a look.
Congrats on the boat. While you are waiting, you should check out this country and see what they have to offer. Your fans trust your travel channel more than those big news networks.
I tried a Brompton electric cycle...goes really well and folds really nicely. British company.
Dishwasher for sure, looks amazing, can not wait 😂❤😎
The complexity of the solar……..wow
OMG the anxiety,  Im with you guys! 🤞  The boat is looking so cute!!!! proud of you guys for the patience and thanks for bringing us into your journey .
So exciting… go “Tool Time” LOL… Looking forward to all your new adventures. That boat is going to be awesome:-)
Its the journey, not the destination! Challenges make for great stories as they are overcome 1 by 1.
Are you guys putting a sea keeper on your catamaran?
Tim was the Boss.
Congrats to you both.  We love watching every video. Would you consider a “Lessons Learned During the Process” video for those of us behind you in the queue?
I love your videos and am an avid watcher.  For your bike, there is a UK company called Brompton that you may want to look at, I have had one for years and while they have little wheels and don't look very off-roadey, I have taken mine acress fields and allsorts, but shh, don't tell Brompton though.
What's wrong with an electric scooter ?
I know Tim the toolman Taylor! But I think I'm a very similar age as you 😆
Hi Jason and Nikki. With regards to the electric bikes. I have one very similar to the one you shown made by a company called Paselec with the fat tyres too and I have to warn you, they are very very heavy to pick up and lug around! Not only that, when folded they are not narrow at all. More like wedge shaped. I love mine but to be honest I wouldnt recommend one for boat use. I would suggest going to have a look at the Brompton range of folding e bikes. Yes the wheels are more narrow but the plus side of that is better efficiency. Fat tyres suck up a lot of power and energy. Hope this helps!
I’m praying it’s a dishwasher.
You guys have done well whilst waiting for the whole project to be finished. So close, exciting times. Love the vlog :)
The polishing system should cure your fuel problem..
So exciting,I love being part of this journey! ❤️
Really excited to see your boat nearly finished. Looking forward to seeing y'all back on the water.  Carlos and Mandy in Bama.
Wow the reflection of the water rippling on the hull is amazing.  That color will make her disappear against tropical water.    No lucky coins under the mast?
Ha ha: A soft "lunch" is more like a dress rehearsal.
Or Jason “the Toolman” Wynn hohoho😂
If you're bored come down to Hong Kong! Make your way to Lamma island and find the pizza place and I'll give you one on the house 😂
Anybody know what time it is???? Tool time!
yes, I know Tim "The Toolman" Taylor. I'm a millennial too. RE: Bicycle.... I would go the electric scooter route like a NIU KQI3 Max. 40 miles/70KM of range!
Get yourselves some Bromptons - not the best off-road but amazing bikes in very small packages!
Check out Jupiter Bikes they have several off road bikes and the batteries are removable.
Looking good!  You both waited this long, what's a few more weeks? Who doesn't remember Tim Allen in Home Improvement?
Awesome to see her finally in the water for the first time. 👍👍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🤘🏻🤘🏻
Awesome for the Wynns. Congratulations guys! We are all CURIOUS about how she travels. Fair winds. Next time….
Build your own electric bike. Buy a cheap bike, throw an electric wheel on the back(motor in the hub).  Done less than 300 dollars.
I know “Tool Time”! Are you getting a set of Binford tools?
I have a husky mix rescue dog that does Tim the Tool Man Taylor (ooow-roooo) PERFECTLY!
I love my Gocycle. I used it for commuting along the Thames tow path for around a year but the fine dust got into the bearings, gears and motor and I needed to get these replaced. It coped with the slightly bumpy terrain, but it is much more suited to paved surfaces. I don’t think this is for you.
Tern bikes.  Vectron.  Have two older bikes that have been durable and traveled well.
lOVE tim the tool man tailor!!!!  your patience is second to none,  the day will come as it did for Teresa and Nick...just keep swimming...:)
Yes!  Tim, the Tool Man Taylor!
Finally a dishwasher!!! 😂💪🏻
Oh my goodness   your boat is stunning!!! So happy your back and can't wait for new Curiosity Adventures!! 🩵⛵️🩵✨️💯💎✨️
Jason  you are obsessed with electric stuff  bicycle should be manual you can buy aluminum ultra light folding bike ,you are young exercise should be your primary goals not seating on electric bikes ,don't be like Greta N who said from now on all gitars in Sweden must be electric😂 😂
The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning. You’re getting ready to finish up the boat and end that part and start the next.   And anyone who doesn’t know Tim Allen at this time of year, well, they just are anti-Christmas seeing as how he’s Santa Claus, because he got caught up in the Santa clause. (grunt grunt grunt) However, I guess these days he’ll have to go to Harbor freight or Farm & Fleet seeing as how Sears is pretty much gone. I have to admit, though I used to feel the same way when I walked into a Sears store and went over to the Tool section.
I remember "Tool Time" very well.  It was the debut of Pamela Anderson.  ;)
Well, Christmas is coming. Maybe you'll get a nice gift.  Patience grasshopper, patience. Nikki got a new do?
I still watch the reruns of Home Improvement lol
TIM THE TOOL MAN!  One of my favorite shows!  You go Jason!
Love you guys!  So excited 2 see how the boat is coming along.  Be well ❤
Velo de ville kes 900. Compact folding bike. 37x95x108cm. Get a belt drive. Zero maintenance. Will handle all terrain. Costs a bunch.
❤❤
I know Tool Time 😂
As for fuel problems for a 150-gallon tank for our generator, we add 20 gallons of jet-A  jet fuel haven't had a problem with growth in the fuel cence we started doing this. Before, we would have to clean the tank at least twice a year now only biannually
Jason, Tim Allen show was one of the best shows to watch as a family. I loved it my husband loved it and I was not afraid for my children to watch the show. We laughed so much at the stupid stuff and the silly jokes. I wish they had shows like that! Yes it does date us.
More powerrrrrrrrrrrrrr huhuhu
Everyone knows Tim 'The Toolman' Taylor.
Seems a little strange the anti fouling paint is not done before putting boat in water but hey what do I know, suppose it was fairly viols it was going to come back out anyway when there are no props on the boat. 🤷🏻‍♂️
More power!!! Aurgh! Aurgh! Aurgh! Aurgh! Aurgh!
No more dishpan handz...!
I fully endorse (not that you need it) in building a NAS. I would highly suggest building it yourselves, or commission someone too do so for you, for purposes of weight. Solid state NVMe drives have come down significantly in price per GB that they would make sense on a boat. Spinning disks will add weight and energy consumption. Yes there is a faster end of life for SSDs but if you RAID the drives properly you will not loose data. Also, if I may, there was a point you made about the cabinets. It is very true that cheap quality is light and good quality is heavier. But often the best quality is even lighter than the cheap. In cars it is plastics to sheet metals to carbon fibres. I would imagine that would be the same as the boat world.
Binford dishwasher ??
Did I hear "dishwasher" ????
💃🕺🍾🎉❤ CONGRATULATIONS 💋
Maybe all terrain scooters could be better than bikes.
Thank you for sharing.
Don't worry, Jason. I grew up watching Home Improvement too!
can't help but get the feeling that there is a whole lot of stuff you are not telling.. hmmm. well, best.
DISHWASHER?
Congratulations.  One step closer.  I waited until the end to ask.  Will there be a final coat of paint on the bottom?
Saw the news that the HH44 won an award. Congratulations 🍾on buying a design winner 🏆 Are you going to place a coin under the mast?  Oh, but the bikes you want and find the room. Better utility is worth it.
Looks like a bunch of back yard rookies are building the boat.
Tool time!!! I got the joke👍
I don’t think so, Tim…
I remember Tool time it was a good show back in the 90s.
Loved Tool Time! Auhhh auhh
A little tip , put Lucas in your fuel it will help keep your fuel clean and give you better fuel mileage .😇
I still think you should have gone with the Binford 4400 sailboat... :)
Hopefully that hint is that Jason is getting a dishwasher!
As soon as I heard, “More Power,” I knew.  I’m sad for those who didn’t know.
Well done both of you. Huge stress managed beautifully, keeping your collective senses of irony about the 1st World Problems issues in commissioning a yacht and remaining pleasant and entertaining the while. 👍
It just baffles me that your channel does not have over one million subscribers. Your content is great and the both of you are awesome.
It's been a long time coming, great job!! The boat is absolutely beautiful!!
Congrats 🎉good luck with the mast
Nikki - how I'd love to see some "words I'd REALLY like to be using on this vid" pop-up bubbles above your head while talking about your frustrations. 😅  You really did a great job of holding back, keeping it clean, and of smiling. You guys are a highlight of my Sunday mornings.
On bikes: 2.6 - 2.8 in wide tires are all you need. I ride mtb in the desert rocks and sand on 2.8. No need for "fat" tires. If you have a mid-drive instead of hub drive, taking wheels off is easy. Now, without wheels, how small is that bike? I'm hoping this opens your search to more types of bikes.
Ruh Row Raggy.....  Scooby snacks for Jason and Wine for Nikki!
For the e-bike you might want to try to find one with standard tires and tubes….or carry pare parts. Having a flat 15 miles from your boat with no way to fix is horrible.
Congrats!
Love the color.  Love the look, even without the mast, for now!  Progress.  Little by little.  I feel your pain in waiting.  But putting over six decades of living behind me, I have slowly accepted the idea of taking one day of adventure at a time.  Today is what we have spent so much time looking forward to and NOW I'm impatient for tomorrow to get here.  You recovered well progressively through your video.  That is wonderful.  Both of you have tremendous gravitas working together.  You are heroes in so many ways.  Very admirable.  What a wonderful journey you have shared with all of us!  And I have yet to watch all of your videos.  However, from the accumulation of those I have watched, you have been very, very inspiring.  You two move with grace, intelligence, humor, excitement, and awe.  Thank you again, for tall that you've produced and shared.  GREAT job!
The most important factor when selecting an electric mobility device is safety of the battery.
Groovy episode.
Did you take the time to visit some other places around China, the High Speed train from Xiamen to Shenzhen is quick and you could come and visit the most famous electronics area in the world called HuaQiangBei, DJI is also in Shenzhen.
I have a Binford tools t-shirt. I appreciated the Tool Time reference.
Curious what you’ve chosen for bottom paint ?
Heck yes I remember tool time rewatching it now it's on Disney+. This is for you Jason aaarrrrruuh! Anyways been watching since the early days just love what you two are doing keep up the great work.
When do they complete the painting on the lower hulls + anti fouling + boot stripe?
Thanks guys, I'm so excited. It's good to see Vietnam so peaceful
Curiosity looks pretty sharp as a power-cat! You could cruise around locally testing your solar, inverters, systems & engines while you wait.
Tim Taylor was much more masculine. Sorry…..😢
Few weeks delay is nothing in the context of the years, and years, and years of adventure to come!  Stay patient and enjoy!
awesome !!!!!! Let's Go !!!!!!!
get a couple onewheels for offroad and a couple wowgo electric skateboards.  cheers, good luck
Jason,  I immediately got the Tim the Tool man Taylor reference🤣🤣. The boat looks awesome guys. I can’t wait to you sailing away and continuing your journey!
I personally wouldn't bring an electric bike onto a boat because they can be prone to thermal issues that might lead to a fire hazard.
Yay dishwasher! Lol
Dishwasher!! Yay.
Loom at the Tern ebkes
More Power ! Tool Time reference, love it ! Almost there, the last bits and pieces are coming together. I'm so excited for you guys.
One of the things I liked so much about YouTube was that you didn’t have to put up with all the fake drama bs, well now it’s become part of this channel.    Sad
Adobike 👍
Oh oh oh oh
I have the Lectric and they are heavy and bulky. They may be difficult to transport with a dingy.
Grew up watching the Tims
The color is GORGEOUS! Can’t wait to see the sails😘
After the preciseness of the factory designs and construction, to find the rigging the wrong length has to be a shock.  The Company has to be embarrassed, to say the least. I expect it is one of the few components they outsource. An unfortunate impact on you financially and emotionally, for sure. I understand if you can't, but some comment on their reaction would be very interesting. Also, to second some other comments,  some information as to costs and financing, within the bounds of fiscal security, would be very interesting to those of us who live this life vicariously through you ❤.
There are allot of fires with electric bikes in New York.
I have two Lectric bikes. I bought them two years apart. I found that the second one was just a bit thinner, about 1inch. This means the the second one just fits into the storage space on our motorhome. The older one won't fit (by an inch) where I planned to store it. so really check the size if the storage space is tight. Other than that, I'm happy with the bikes.
Hey Jason, my son purchased a V1 Lectric XP a couple years ago. First, I measured our folded dimensions real quick and came up with this: 37 x 19 x 28 in and everything folds. It fits in a chevy bolt compact rear truck for reference. The downside would be lowering it into a locker because it's 70lbs... albeit with the battery. Maybe you could rig a lift system to bring it up partway...? Second, it's fantastic! It has a LOT of power and more range than I could ever see needing. I stole it an did a local greenway, with hills, and stop and go crosswalks in places, staying in pedal assist 2 of 5 most of the way and full throttling it for fun a few times and did 27 miles non-stop and it was almost out of juice. With stops, I think myself and the bike would have had more range. Last, I didn't catch if you were trying to get 1 or 2 of them but the new ones have that secondary seat option in the back which might be an option for you both. Bonus, they are easy to mod with additional batteries purchased off amazon to double that range if you needed it with 2 passengers... Hope that helps!
Looks grat. What excuse did they give you for such a collosal mistake with the shrouds?
WILSON!
Congratulations guys 🎉top tip take pictures of the areas there closing in for future reference so You knows what’s inside in case of complications…
One MPPT per panel the most efficient transfer of power from the panels to the batteries.  Upfront cost more but also much more reliable in the long run ....one panel fails not a big deal. much worth it! Congrats on whoever made that engineering change.
Your comment about being docked behind the 60; Exactly what I thought at the beginning when I saw a 44 beside an 88. Can't wait for the 88 build series in what, 5 years?
I have several contributing factors that keep me going.  The Wynns are one of them.  Thank you.
Yes I know Tim the Tool Man Taylor. 🔧 🔨 🗜 🧰
see weighs the same as a rapido 60?
Beautiful boat love the color.
Maybe the bikes won’t be too heavy if you disconnect the battery before you stow it?
Couldn't be more excited for you guys. Regarding those fabric whisper wall panels, if you have to access something behind them, can you pop off the whole panel, or do you have to remove and then re-insert the cloth with a putty knife?
Swytch is the name of bike conversion kit maker.
Great job on the video folks! Thanks for making it.
Loved the show Home Improvement! 😂 Everyone calls it tool time because that was what Tims show was called on the show. But Home Improvement was the actual name. I'll never forget when they finally showed Wilson's face!
Will you be using a biocide treatment in the diesel for added protection?
The Lectric XP Lite is 20 lb lighter and folds smaller
Of the three sailing YouTubers I watch  that built boats, yours is the one I would have picked.
Tool time Tim Allen. Hello Wilson🤣🤣
So close ❤
Brompton
I see the bottom does not look completely finished. It looks lime you are lacking some anti fouling paint. Am I missing something?
Wow….talk about patience.  I can’t wait to see this girl sailing for the first time. Thank you for another great video and updat‼️🥂⛵️⚓️
Of course we also know Tool Time in Germany.   The title here is:."Hör mal wer da hämmert..."  Tim's saying also applied here: "Mehr Power" - "More Power".
The highs and lows for both of you have got to be….umm…..hard to put into words.
Your new home is beautiful. I must admit I wasn't convinced by the colour at first, but on the water, she looks fantastic.
Yes, “Tool Time” 😂
What a beautiful boat!!🎉 Congratulations and looks like you guys are going to have a lot more room. 🎉🎉🎉P.S I love Tool Time
Why does the bottom look so dirty?
Thank You.
Brompton makes an electric version of their bike that is super compact.
Looks like they didn't paint the hull, so this has got to come back out to has the hull done. But what do I know. Can't wait to see you somewhere afloat with all your new thingies to figure out. Oh I see. Hang in there, better problems now than half way from nowhere. Don''t worry with all these delays you'll probally be well into storm season on the way to the phillippines. 🤞😎👍
Know you know has a channel dedicated to reviewing ebikes  https://youtube.com/@nowletsreview6700?si=-2p_b_rYlGNRpCaN  hope this helps
I love your channel and the stories of your lives. But, AG1 sucks. AG1 is among the more expensive greens powders on the market—in some cases, costing nearly twice as much as rival products. Cons: lack of research to confirm safety or effectiveness. It's expensive. It  does not contain vitamin D or iron. It does not list exact ingredient amounts for proprietary blends. It may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, and bloating for many. It's not appropriate for many people, including  those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking certain prescription medications and those who have certain medical conditions. You and other sailing channels loose credibility by hawking the overpriced AG1.  Thanks for sharing the rest of the video. 😉
Hitway BK6M folding Ebike
Sad that you have to wait even longer, but what a beautiful boat! I hope Jason gets his dishwasher!
Why dont you look at the off road type electric scooters. Can even have trailers.
Definitely know Tim the Tool Time guy!  Question...is the bottom of the boat going to be revsealed or painted more?  It seemed like a very thin coat with lots of patching visible.
I got Tool Time reference!  😂😂🤣🤣👊👊👍👍
That solar is so cool! Bummer about the mass. 🤞🙏 it comes together soon. Cheers
👍
Looks great.
Was not sure about the color when you first told us - but seeing it in the water - LOVE IT! Yes to Jason - Tim the tool man will live forever!
Ahh did someone get their dishwasher? That is what it sounded like...😅😮
Lectric XP Lite is 46 lbs
You two are getting closer and closer, and they are making sure it is all done right. This next week might feel like forever, but it will be done before you know it and you will be on your boat before you know it!
Exciting times
Tool Time!!! Ohg, Oh, Ohg..
Dishwasher!!!!!!!!!!!
Jack rabbit $999.00 24 lbs Folds to 7” wide 10 mile range  XP Lite $749.00 46 lbs 30 (40) miles pedal assist 36x16x28 folded
Still go with the Lectric but take a wheel off.  Or make them come up with something custom for you. So many Cruisers would jump on them if they make them even more compact.
12:50 I am a bit older than you and know Tim the Tool Man. I suspect that the solar changes mean more power in less than ideal conditions. As the boom and mast cast a shadow it will reduce output of each panel based on how much that panel is shadowed.
Dishwasher next week!
Home Improvement !!  And Jason gets a dishwasher?
I loved Tim's neighbor who never showed his face. Funny.
Love Y’all!Home Improvement was one of my favorite programs! Can’t wait to see y’all’s first sailing video on the open water!!!!
I’m a little surprised by the choice of the Genasun charge controllers. They are excellent but not networked. What’s the solution for monitoring the system?
Ohhhhh, she is BEAUTIFUL! Looks so good in the water. Congratulations and enjoy 🥂
Why did it look as if they didn’t complete the bottom paint? Beautiful above waterline!
E bikes are VERY dangerous due to "Thermal Runaway".  Thermal runaway is a chain reaction within a battery cell that can be very difficult to stop once it has started. It occurs when the temperature inside a battery reaches the point that causes a chemical reaction to occur inside the battery.  If the cause of excessive heat creation is not remedied, the condition will worsen. Internal battery temperature will continue to rise - causing battery current to rise - creating a domino effect. The rise in temperature in a single battery will begin to affect other batteries in close proximity, and the pattern will continue, thus the term “runaway.”  A LOT of care needs to be taken when charging.  Don't just set it inside, plug it in and go to bed. Just as you would not put something on the stove and forget it, the same with E bikes.   Take care
There's a company - forgotten the name but popular - that give a battery & a replacement drive wheel, as part of a kit, to make any bike electric. Find any bike that fits your hold & convert it.
Regarding the bikes, there are conversion kits out there that can be put on conventional bikes. Not necessarily cheap (but then, neither is a dedicated e-bike).
When you announced the colour of your boat I thought no no no, but wow was I wrong your boat was absolutely stunning sitting on the water, I take a bow to your foresight.
Life is a bit like surfing with periods of no activity interspersed with periods of frantic activity. Learning to weave all the elements of strength and balance with gentle flow and forceful changes of direction is the core of living. Before you get to paddle for that first wave though you get to paddle through the incoming surf which consists of struggling out and getting pushed backwards.  The frustration is all forgotten when you catch the wave and stand up and feel all the elements working together to move you down the line in an exhilarating rush. All that you’re experiencing will reach a conclusion and you will sail away and the adventure will continue…
Looking GOOD! Nice to see her in the water! As you say, the beginning...  Light too! But heavy enough to provide a good ride when underway likely...  Congrats guys! SOOO happy for you!  🙏🙏🙏 👍😎👍
❤❤❤ Tool Time! Bless you guys, It's like Christmas morning getting delayed!😕😕😕 Oh the joy when it is ready to sail!!
Tim the tool man was the best. More power!!!!!!
The color looks great in the water. It should really be a nice "look" in a blue lagoon someplace !!
Dishwasher next week?
Why are they doing this when it doesn’t look finished?
Jealous doesn't cover it, what a beautiful boat!  Congratulations on your dishwasher Jason!
Lectric lite  ebike
are you aware how many of these electric bikes are catching fire when being on loadingstation…never ever would take one of these on a boat
If you are buying electric bikes then China is the place I suppose.
Your Tool Time reference was not lost  on me.
We have the Lectric xp lite . We ride on the beach no problem. We down graded from the 3.0 because we RV full-time and the Lite is smaller and lighter.
Jason needed a hug.  ♥
Everyone knows Tim the Tool Man Taylor! Great video. Thanks for sharing 🌺
Wow. Looks amazing. So much for you guys to take in and process. Um, when’s the bottom paint? Last?
Like we all don't know what the big debate was... An I easily got the Tool Time reference. I'm older though. But I would think younger guys would too. Isn't it a meme?
Loving watching the progress ( one step forward two steps back it seems) So I am curious are you ever going to divulge the total cost of your new boat? I am loving watching these weekly videos , can’t wait for trials.
Ahhreeugh! Tim the tool man is the man
Of course we know Tim the Tool Man Taylor!
So with the new boat, you going to get new kitty(s) for the new adventure?
Finally!
Another wonderful video. Thank you for sharing! 😍🤩😘
It's so good but also so hard to wait for it but glad to see your journey through it all.
@ 14:44 Go w/first choice! Lectric looks better for the unimproved places you want to go.
Curiosity is DEAD SEXY!!!
Cool glad I caught this. I think the color is leet! Gj
Thanks!
Looks amazing in the water.  Re bikes, are you not worried about lithium fires?  The batteries they use for bikes do not seem to be as stable as ones you would get for your boat batteries
I don't think so, Tim...
Better Right than Right Now.
When the hull being painted?
Yes Jason, tool time more power!  So many good things happening to Curiosity!
My wife and I are in the middle of a Home Improvement binge!! hahaha MORE POWER!!
Is Jason getting his dishwasher?????
I remembered Tool Time! Ohhh, maybe we will see a dishwasher next episode. ❤ One step closer. 🎉
A bunch of micro-inverters in the ceiling, that's a lot of parts that can fail! Hopefully not.😁
How about the Lectric Lite?
Jason's getting his dishwasher!!!
Hi guys. We own 2 Lectric bikes and like them. We stow them in wheeled Rubbermaid tubs. We also have the original shipping boxes if you want some dimensions.    It has to be really frustrating waiting and waiting but hang in there.
SO  E X C I T I N G ! ! ! ! !
Do you really need electric bikes?  No offense but people have been using human powered bicycles for over 150 years.
Totally got your Tim the Tool man reference.
It real good    I belive I would have keep the old one
It’s a process you wouldn’t want any other way but to be right.  Enjoy the journey ❤️ Hugs for overcoming the challenges ⛵️
I’m here for you. Keep ya chins up. 😌 also, DISHWASHER! 🤣
Nikki, it's the end of the beginning!
Tool Time!  Yes!  Love the reference!
@21:21 Dishwasher! Go Team Jason!
Of course I know Tim the Tool Man.  I’d like him to work on my lawnmower.  Sorry for your delays but this is exciting to watch.
I know Tim the Tool Man!
tool time was awesome. I loved watching that show
ANY Fat tire bike is going to be heavy. It will help if you remove the battery before putting them away. (They should be recharged after every use anyway) I have ridden a fat tire bike in all conditions and they certainly can go way more places than a regular tire bike can. (Mud, sand and large gravel.)
Great! A lot easier than sideways
EeeeeEEK
So, what about the chinese new year shut down? How is that going to effect your delivery?
Great episode.  Ying and Yang and next time..... the dishwasher, the subject of great debate.
The vintage retro turquoise blue is stunning on the modern cat lines. Will be interesting to see retractable scoops operate in the water. They look like an added safety plus. Best wishes on enjoying your new home.
I know a guy. He bought a e bike. Put it in his house and it burned his house down. Cost him everything. Just sayin
The tool man is the best, hope that last minute item is Jason's dishwasher!
Well, It's 615am gmt -8 and... Iwuzgunna go to bed but I've been waiting for this. Pretty sure I'm not the only one either. Congrats, woop woop and all that! Edit: The hull color is gorgeous in the water and the reflections of the ripples so cool.
Exciting! and stressful..
21:05 Dishwasher by any chance 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
I enjoyed Home Improvement and more power was a fun part of that show. Happy Holidays
So excited for y’all can’t wait for next week. Please do a shopping video for the little things that will make the boat your home.
Your smiles are contagious. 😂😷
Wow, big day/days.    So complex. Lots of wires and connections.  Looks like they will stay dry though.  Beautiful boat.
Hey I know who Tim the tool man is! Im even much older than him. Im so sorry this was so stressful. But it always seems to be that whatever happens seems meant to be.
Hey Jason im 70 and there is nothing wrong with more power. LOL
Boat improvement.  Vs home improvement
Yes I know Tim the tool man. But he is now a radicalized Trumper. It’s sad.  I can’t watch anything with Tim Allen anymore.
She floats!!! ❤❤❤  I will say it again, and I know it hurts while you’re going through it but… you never know what the bad is good for.  Let me guess. Jason is going to have extra time every evening. 😉😁❤️❤️
While you wait, please take us on a tour of the area you are in.
I got the Tim reference. But I’m 48, so take that with a grain of salt. 😂
Great episode. I am anxious for you guys to be done. I hope it comes together soon.  Thanks again for sharing! Warren
I’m looking at all the work yet to be done, the number of people involved, does HH actually make a profit on this sale?
Ahhhh…. So close!  Well, hopefully better news next week.  You both be safe and see you soon.
I have a gotrax 350w. No special tires, just exta tubes! Only one flat in 3 years, trails and roads. Dont' worry bout it.
The wait will be worth it.  :)
Tim the toolman Taylor 😂👊
who doesn't know Tim the Tool Man Taylor??? he's a legend
Tim the Tool Man Taylor!!!
It has been almost a year since I checked in on you guys. I need to catch up. Like coming home to see a dear friend 🧡
She's looking good! I can't wait until she's finished! :D
Jason is getting a dishwasher…Congrats on the new boat. Looking forward to all the new adventures.
Tool Time FTW!!!
Love Tim the Toolman Taylor and his Binford 3000 tools
Dishwasher 😉 sounds like you won Jason. 👍
How about Varla scooters
That's fantastic news
Oh My Gosh, it's time!!!!! Congratulations!! Love your hair, Nik
14:55 get the bikes you want but have quick release wheels? Front and back. 🤷🏼‍♂️
It’s been a big debate…Wait, is Jason getting his dishwasher?
can't you change the tires to allow the bikes to run in the woods?
So happy for you guys glad you have finally got her in the water!!!
Better the shrouds be too long then two short. You can't make a piece that is too short longer aka measure twice cut once......twice. The dishwasher I'm sure was not affected by this issue I trust? Ebike advice, we have 3 in our household currently. Consider a higher end standing e-scooter. Just as fun, more range, lighter weitht, and significantly less space. If you dongo folding ebike id stay away from ones that have specialized components and cant have the standard bike parts fixed with standard bike parts.
Congrats guys! Such a momentous occasion!
I would contact Mike Patey, He builds aircraft and check out his plane Scrappy he has solar on the wings and hangs 2 electric bikes under each wing, for offroad fun. Im sure he can suggest and maybe even build them for you. He is an incredible engineer.
I'm so excited for you two.  It's got to be a big relief to see your boat in the water.  I'm betting the next week will seem like a month or two waiting for everything to get finished.   I've got a little idea of how you guys feel, I just started my full time journey in my RV.  Keep the good stuff coming guys.
Every time I am amazed by the awesome color!
Why isn't the boat painted on the bottom yet? She sure is a beautiful boat. It looks like it will sail nice and smooth in the water.
Did Jason get braces for his 40th birthday? Never too late. Congrats on the launch.
AHHH! The way I screamed at the RN Hub in the ER. I can’t wait to clock out to watch this!!! I’m so excited and happy for you! ❤🎉
EVERYONE knows Tim the toolman!!! With ya Jason

Thanks to AG1 for supporting us in so many ways, including helping our bodies manage stress! Get a 1 year supply of vitamin D3+K2 & 5 travel packs FREE with your first purchase: https://drinkAG1.com/gonewiththewynns  Unfortunately, there was a bit of an issue with our rigging and the mast couldn’t go on.  These things do occasionally happen (wrong part or wrong size gets shipped out) and everyone has to hustle to remedy the issue.  It’s not terribly surprising considering we are the first HH44 Ocean Cruising Catamaran.  Hull #1 and #2 were both the Sport Cruising versions that have a different mast and rigging (we’ll get into those details when the mast goes on).  Unsurprising or not, it was a sting to learn of yet another delay.  Especially when emotionally, we feel like a couple of stray dogs, staring into the window of a bacon factory.  So close, and yet soooo far away.  First world problems at best and to quote Vanilla Sky, “the sweet isn’t as sweet without the sour”.  There’s far more sweetness ahead and speaking of sweet...CURIOSITY looks delightfully delicious floating in the water!
