going to work 😁
🎉🎉🎉
compared to Bafta, the yt play button got off easy 😅
:29   Those guttural, primal grunts of a beast-lord. Devouring the sacrifices of lesser beings. I’m not surprised they’re on series 16 already; the Taskmaster is hungry, always hungry and never satisfied. “Dance, monkeys!” He cries, perched atop his golden throne. “Nil points!” He bellows, gleefully dismissing the earnest efforts of his subjects. He is powerful and in peak physical condition and his tasks are rightly demanding. Maybe one day a contestant in his games will satiate his appetite and cool his wrath. But it is not this day…not this day.
Is that a Nando chicken?
Icl I preferred taskmaster when it was on Dave
Love from Texas! Best show, ever (I'm not including US show in this statement). My life is better with Taskmaster. The show has brought so much joy! Thank you thank you thank you!! I will say I'm surprised there's just over a million followers - everyone needs Taskmaster in their lives!!!
*I'm certainly NOT subscribed to this overhyped channel. The first two or three series of the game were bearable but he programme is now getting fairly long in the tooth. Time to do something else! On top of that, he international versions we're fed back are an absolute embarrassment.*
aahahahahahaahahahahahahahaah the thumbnail. Thank you to whoever had that idea
I thought Greg didn't like chicken off the bone...
Bad dong
Colin Furze has 15M. Just saying.
Congratulations
That is exactly what I would do
Very valid
Like a lot of people I discovered TM through the youtube channel back quite a few series now. My friends and I all watch and discuss it together. I am sad we (Canada) are region-locked out of new episodes, but I am sure it is not entirely in the hands of the producers of this show.
I discovered TM through Youtube and couldn't be more thankful for the episodes you released during the pandemic. Congratulations, Alex, Greg, and Co.!
Just finished watching this last season (as we call it in the US)... I would love to be featured on one of these seasons to come. If only I were famous and lived in Europe.... Taskmaster is by far my favorite way to decompress after a long week of work. I hate having to wait for the next season to start, but when it comes it's oh so joyous! Every time it comes on I can't wait to shout "Little Alex Horne!" And my best high-pitched Greg Davies voice....
Thanks to Trash taste I discovered this piece of a gem of a show. It's so good. Am binging all of it!!!!
most are bots or fake accounts. Look at how many channels have 1m subs but only get less than 50% of that viewing their uploads.
i think even if i didn't just watch this at 1:30am i'd feel very perplexed and be giggling
Best panel show.
Quite the fowl mouth. Tsk tsk.
Congratulations
The best thing ever done with one of those.
See, it's funny cause Greg is overweight
LOL 😂
thanks for sharing on youtube taskmaster
Congrats Alex and team.
Never hated being living in the US more then 5 minutes ago when I finally found out I can’t download the All 4 app unless I change my IP Address.
classic
I could watch several hours of Greg aggressively eating different foods with an attitude.
So glad you put Taskmasters on the Youtube's!,  I never knew it even existed  and now I hope it never stops! Phenomenal job you two! To the crew as well!
Chicken good!
Taskmaster has literally saved my life over the last two months. I discovered it at  a time when my depression was the most bleak. I can't thank Greg & Alex & all of the contestants enough for what they've done to bring light and laughter back into my hollow feeling world.
Has Greg been hitting the gym cause damn 🥵
What a power move
It got 1 million subscribers?? God, I didn’t even know that! Well deserved, of course! But I only watch like a hole season of task master in 2 days every one month or so, lmao. I don’t keep up to date at all. And this was uploaded 2 days ago?? Just awesome!! :D :D
Relatable, i like chicken as well
'...chicken', the Naddpod /taskmaster crossover no one saw coming
I thought I had a lot to comment on. Then I recognized: cleverness reflected in a mirror isn't all that funny. Thanks for making this show, Alex. Thanks for your brilliant, if judgemental performances, Greg.   Truly, your show has been a welcoming light through some dark times for me and I presume many others. And by others, I mean, more particularly, Ed Gamble.)
Why would you eat bone-in chicken with a knife and fork?
I’m so glad y’all got to 1 million subscribers very well deserved
You guys are funny ;)
Like... Denethor meets The Gruffalo. (The Gruffalo!)  Congrats on the million subs!
Totally my favorite show.
Well there's gratitude, munching a WHOLE chicken off of the award. Mr Davies your in trouble my friend. Lol congrats.
I cannot get enough of Task Master!!! My favorite show!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Awesome!
🎵🎶1 for the money, 🎵2 for the show,🎶all my chickens, go go go🎵
AWESOME! Where is season 12?! 🤣 I’m only 2 episodes in and it disappeared!
YT is a horrible corporation please dont pander to it again. get OPERA browser so you arent subjected to the commercials.
weird. its ok to go grey greg. this show is clearly humanities only hope as i keep saying again and again, so dont dye your hair, we need you!
How useful!
Greg eating that chicken 😂😂😂😂
Bloody Brilliant!!!! These 2 together and Taskmaster is the best thing on TV that's a facted jack!!!
Now the Taskmaster needs a 10M plaque for his Dessert.  🏃‍♀️ Right... I'm on it!
It really is pointless enough to eat chicken off of haha
Greg wearing infrared airmax 90’s, his now my god 🔥👍🏻👌🏻🇬🇧
They should do an origin story of Greg & Alex.
Do you really need to monetize Taskmaster on YouTube? The ads are so f*cking annoying. One 40 minute taskmaster video has 30+ ad interruptions.  Half a million or more views on every video and 30 ads on each video... This channel must be raking it in.
Taskmaster is THE most creative & bonkers show that I've EVER come across. I love that it gives people the chance to uncover their real selves and be weird & funny while attempting to solve baffling challenges 🤔🤣🤣
Rhod will have that away from under your nose lol
winner-winner? :) I'm sure you are just months if not weeks away from the 10M. Fantastic show with wonderful people. Carry on!
Well deserved  Keep producing the gold Never surrender
LoL - I could almost taste that delicious chicken Greg. Congrats!
Only 1 million. That's crazy I don't think that's a lot anymore 😂
You cheeky boys, you've gone and done it. Glad to be here for it, and here's to many more discovering the joy that is Taskmaster.
Happy Thanksgiving
I don’t know what I expected this video to be; but it certainly wasn’t this.   I guess that’s why I keep watching this silly program.
“Use this plaque in the most unusual way, you have 20 minutes, your time starts now!”
Greg's eating whole chickens off a table. All Alex needs is some magic beans and the scene is set.
can't wait to see the feast Greg will rip into at 10mil
Best show ever, people I'd like to see back - Mike Wozniak, Hugh Dennis, Bob Mortimer, Nish Kumar, Ed Gamble, Guz Khan, Sophie Duker. Also I'd love to see David O'Doherty on it.
I work with this show on the background so I think I've "seen" every uploaded episode 20+ times
this is my favourite youtube channel. you should make a tv series out of it!
How can i ever eat chicken off a plate again after seeing how good life can get?! I've been living a joke, i may as well have been eating it from the bin.
Well deserved, congrats!  As someone who’s not from the UK I’d never discover this content gem!   Love it! Cant wait for the new episodes to drop!!!!
That was so TM... Also, I have noticed Greg seems to be taking the TM persona into other shows (Buzzcocks et al). In another thread I mentioned "When will we get Countdown Does Task Master"? I repeat the question here cos it's more likely to be seen.... Rachel, Suzie, Joe, Jimmy, Jon, Lucy... perfection for a TM series. I really can't decide if I'd want to see Jon and Lucy on the same side and bickering or against each other and claiming bragging rights....
Love the show ... I just don't always get these bits, sorry Alex, Greg being mean to you isn't really funny (to me) - Ah, so I read the comments and this is about not doing the obvious thing of putting the award on the wall... still, not enjoying the mean bits.
The Taskmaster is not concerned about such trivial things! Begone Alex
Hmmmm chicken
Greg ya big Muppet I love you
Well that's still a better use of the award than giving it to Kerry Godliman, she would have just put it in on a random shelf in her garage.
Mmm... Chicken. That's what I would do.
Get this congratulatory comment to 10,000 thumbs up for no other reason than. Yes, that's right. Than. Your time starts now.
Taskmaster (and this YT channel specifically) have helped me and my 60 something, Belfast-born mother connect more joyfully and easily than pretty much any piece of media we've consumed in the past decade. You two (and the entire TM crew) deserve all of the success in the world!
I really miss the full episodes on Youtube 😢
I’m part of a community that understands how amazing this show is. Yay me! Now, if only I could convince more people to understand…. My time starts………NOW.
Congrats on 1 million! Been here since the channel launched during the pandemic.
You two are the strangest people I've ever seen in my entire life. Keep up the good work.
I thought Greg didn't eat chicken off the bone
The irony being this footage is just about the only thing on this channel that's not a clip of the show
Most cable shows, TV stars or companies feel fake and out of touch on Youtube. Not here, not Taskmaster; I genuinely believe this is more than deserved. From putting up exclusives, clips and bonus footage, this channel is it's own lifeblood and only adds to the show. Well deserved award, I hope you guys feel a great sense of pride~
The fact they are in on this and actively makes me so happy. I thought it was just an intern that had a great idea to slap stuff on YouTube
The respect it deserves Greg, well done mate.
I do not understand why I laughed so hard.
Cheers! Incredibly entertaining show, never stop producing it. Absolutely hilarious.
Congratulations! It won't be long till you guys get to 10 million.
I want to marry and cook for Greg.  I think he would appreciate it more than anyone else could. 🥰
off the bone. Quite a concession.
Congrats! Over the last month or so I've started to watch your videos and I find them so funny and also comforting in a weird way, thank you for the videos they really make my day.
Youtube is ASSHO, but Taskmaster is great.
Well deserved ❤
TM is my kind of punk, all day
imagine if they allowed international Youtubers to see their content in full
Greg ferociously eating chicken is how I'd always imagined him eating chicken
I sure hope that award is dishwasher safe.
Thank YOU, Taskmaster…for all of the laughs.  I’m not even joking when I say Taskmaster is responsible for probably 70% of the laughter in my life.  I don’t know what I would do without you!
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, next one is BEEF?
Greg said fuck them vegetables 😂
"I'd like to thank Mike Wozniak's 'Casserole' for helping to achieve this"
Congratulations! And thank you for uploading your content on YT, I`ve discovered your show like three days ago and I`m already on series 4, it`s absolutely amazing!  And yeah, I`m unemployed.
A++++++++ would just eat roasts again
It’s honestly mind-boggling that this channel has so few subscribers.
At 10 million that better be a pheasant.
thank you for putting this show on YouTube, the plaque is well deserved
As a foreigner whose only exposure to British excellence is through YouTube or imperialism, I have to thank Taskmaster for not killing my nan.
THANKYOU  TASKMASTER GANG FOR MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH IN THESE TOUGH TIMES.👏👏👏💕🇦🇺
Gz everyone. Best tv show in years
I am so grateful that you put all this stuff on YT. Considering the thought, work, and resources that (I imagine) go into making the show, that is mind-bogglingly generous. Living in Hungary, I'm not even sure that I could watch it any other way. Congratulations on reaching 1M <3
Lots of love and appreciation!
Just found this show and I love it! Congratulations from Canada!!
Greg. 😍😍😍
This is my first time seeing them without their classic outfits
This show got me through the pandemic
1 Million is still too low. This show is so great. Congratulations Taskmaster!
I feel that the chicken was only a starter for Greg and main course is probably something more substantial like an entire roast pig or summat. I mean, the man is huge. Or Larger than life, as I’m sure he’d say.
0:02 What the F___😳.
fine... i'll subscribe now.
Release more seasons on the channel for the US, please!
Love this show! :) Congrats on 1 mill and see you at 10!~
Congratulations Alex, Greg, every single contestant and everyone who worked on the show too!
Love this show, congrats on a million and cheers to many more
To be fair, that does look like some decent chicken.
"Eat this chicken on the most unexpected plate. Most unexpected plate wins. Your time starts now."  Congrats to the whole Taskmaster team! I've had a ton of fun watching and rewatching this show after I discovered it recently. The fact that you've published so much of the show here even though the show is designed for and broadcasted on TV is incredible. Everyone on the production should feel proud for the one million subs!
Their dynamic is perfect
Congratulations to the whole team. Alex, when you get the 10 million one make sure Greg doesn't find it.
Congrats on the upgrade from TV celebs to Youtube celebs
What threat is so big that the Taskmaster needs an emergency exit? Who or what would dare challenge the TM?
I like Alex's hoodie, that's a nice hoodie So glad I found this channel, my dad's absolutely obsessed now. Proud of you lads 👍👍
Well just another reason to be in love with Greg! 😂❤
Sorry vegans. 😢
legends!! absolute legends...  thanks for the amazing content !!!
i literally just started watching this channel, but im happy i found it. congrats on 1m!!!!
winner winner chicken dinner am I right?
ah what a great show.  Shame its not on youtube anymore
wow, that show is still on?
Hahaha... that was very Taskmaster of you, Greg!
somedays we all need some silliness. how nice you get to share so often... hugs and thank you. 🌻
Casually scored another 40k before I posted this. Congrats guys!
Are y'all gonna let David Baddiel have a go at destroying it? But, seriously, y'all deserve all sorts of joy and rewards for bringing so much clever, funny happiness to the world.
Genius. Nuff said. ☺️
Glad to hear I'm a part of the chicken!
Damn it now I want chicken
♥
to paraphrase the late, great sean lock - "youtube can go f*ck itself" 😆
Congrats! Can you please make a vegan version of this video?
So now we know why TM is on YouTube... Greg broke his old golden chicken plate
The norway version of taskmaster "kongen befaler", the program leader actually got kicked because of being racist in a street
I watch TM almost nightly on YouTube, fall asleep to it. I like being in the middle of a dream then suddenly getting God-like instructions out of nowhere from Little Alex Horne. Definitely makes the orgy more challenging and fun.
Congratulations from NZ. Love the show. Thanks for uploading so we can watch. By far the funniest show online. Cheers for all the actual LOL moments!
Australia???
Greg can do anything. He's the TM. He could run the 4 minute mile in 30 seconds if so inclined.
Glad the guys are involved in the youtube page makes me feel alot better about watching it all
Omg congratulations... 🐔
Lmfao, honestly one of the best gold play button videos ive seen over the years
Well deserved guys.  Not many shows actually make me laugh out loud anymore and your does every time.  Cheers!
Congrats and big thank you for allowing us view TM on youtube! Many hours of joy, comfort and laughs 💚💚💚💚💚
Giving YouTube all the respect it has earned!  I couldn't love the Taskmaster team any more lol.
great stuff, i hope the chicken was delicioous
Watching from Italy! What an Amazing show, well deserved price!
This needs to be hung in the task master house :)
You two never cease to entertain. Keep up the great work. Congratulations.
Someone I follow on Twitter, back when it was good, before Elon destroyed it for not making him happy, a Brit was watching Taskmaster in the UK & was praising it. I found it on YouTube & I've been watching it since!
Only Greg would show his appreciation for the award by eating chicken off it, instead of hanging it on a wall like normal folk. Congrats by the way, well deserved.
Congratz!
Congratulations gentlemen. Well deserved. Thanks from the USA.
Congrats! Thanks for all the laughs 😁
Why isn't Greg dressed up at a fancy table? I need answers
Your task: Get the hell out of my dressing room!
Whoohoo, congrats!   And well deserved if I might add. Taskmaster is an amazing show and it deserves all the love it can get!
I found this channel very recently because of Good Mythical Morning and I have been binge watching the episodes since! I'm so glad it's on YouTube because I'm from the Philippines and wouldn't have had a chance to watch it otherwise. Love this show and thank you for all the laughs! Congratulations on 1M subscribers 🥳 that's a lovely dinner plate right there 👍
Meme time!
🙌🙌🙌🙌 congrats guys👍👍👍
YAYYYYYY I love it, I have to say Taskmaster has to be one of the best game show ever now a days, it really does make me laugh and I can watch old season and still laugh  Can't wait till the other season come out on youtube only up to season 11 and season 14 just came out, =)
Congratulations! I am glad you found use for the golden award 😂
that jittery contained anger of greg always gets me
Magnificent irreverence!
You deserve that chicken xD
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Congrats! Well deserved!!
And I...didn't help.
What would my life be without these two gentlemen.
You'll have 10 million in no time.
What I would like to know is why Alex knocked the word 'foreign'
Yay!
I got a big Heyyy yooouuu guuuuys! vibe from greg here.
Same
Greg eats a whole chicken and chugs 60 beers before each taping, Wade Boggs style  R.I.P. Wade Boggs
Taskmaster is a great show and Greg is a good host, but he's one of the least funny comedians to have appeared on television. The "Little Alex Horn" shtick is the worst attempt at comedy I've ever seen (aside from female comedians talking about their lady bits). He should focus on his strong points (being a tall, intimidating looking, old man) and less on his weaknesses (being funny, original, and young).
good old greg heffley eating his curds and whey
Ha ha, best gold play button video ever 🤣
Perfect.
Congratulations! Its funny cuz at first I thought it was a turkey for Thanksgiving lol
Seeing Greg and Alex wearing hoodies and jeans really did something weird to my brain.
Why did that chicken look so delightfully enjoyable?
Alex... your task is to accept this youtube award wearing the most disgusting 80's themed hoodie you can find..  So that's 5 points to Alex..
well you pay for it... but well deserved :)
Mhmmmm New Season on Youtube maybe....? ^^
Congrats!
"He eats a whole cooked chicken everyday" is currently ringing in my ears XD
Best use of a gold play button yet
He does this like he's done this with other awards. He must be stopped.
Congrats Alex and Greg! Your channel brought so much joy to me during hard times, you guys deserve all the rewards!
Well deserved. Congratulations.
its weird seeing Greg not in a suit
Congratulations to the TM team! I found you last year and I became a fan of the show, I really enjoy the comedy and inventive of each episode. Now you have a mexican fan ✌️
so, when are you going to show the actual show again?
... Who eats chicken with a fork?
I would expect nothing less of Lord Greg than to befowl his award.  Kudos Taskmaster! (and Alex of course 😁)
Missed opportunity to have Greg eat a roast, but I guess chicken will do. Seriously though, congrats! Love Taskmaster!
Greg Davies bullying little Alex Horne on his own show is the greatest idea for a TV show.
Hit all the buttons... Your subscription starts...NOW!
Mom chicken!
Can’t wait for “Mmm… Steak” at the next milestone!!!
I first discovered TM on this channel. It was the one with Fred where he could only speak Swedish. I have never looked back. ❤
Greg, you can be a little testy sometimes. 🤣 Well done Taskmaster. Well deserved. Best craic on YouTube.  'Bravo' Little Alex Horne......
technically Alex, you don't need to wait for 10M for another plaque, you can just order another one 😩 hate to be that guy
interesting
Something is fowl in the state of Gregmark!
Congratulations 🎉  I absolutely love this show 😁😁😁  All hail the magnificent taskmaster 🙌🙌🙌
Damn it's odd to see them not it suits, especially alex
Little polythene grief cave.
Congradulations Alex. Well deserved.
Well since u lifted geo restrictions on ur video it was bound to happen, so take it dikhead 🤣🫰
winner winner chicken dinner served on a golden platter
Congrats!  You guys deserve this and more!
brilliant
I arrived to the TM party late, but I'm a part of that 1 million and that makes me happy
Congrats!!!
Greg, you magnificent beast!
Congrats! I’m so happy this channel exists and I can watch Taskmaster in Canada while supporting the original creators. Couldn’t have happened to a nastier… erm..nicer guy! And that sidekick of yours is pretty funny too😉😆🙌
Gold
And I thought I was mad! Haha 😄
fern was right he does only eat roasts
Congratulations Task Master, and the other guy
But you failed uploading the complete episodes for the international audience :( Congrats and greetings from Mexico
Much love from Texas
Thank YOU for making these videos available.   So much joy!
Am I the only one who found Greg eating a whole roast chicken on a gold plague slightly erotic?
Off to ten million, then!
This award is nothing compared to the beautiful bust trophy of the Taskmasters head. Only BT (Blue Ted) is a close second.
How many chickens does Greg eat every day?
Let's go!!!!
Yay, congrats! Here's to many more, he-he! I've brought unprecedented amount of joy and laughter to me, thank you so much! <3
I know it's all a schtick, the relationship between Greg and Alex, and yet I can't help feeling bad for Alex sometimes.
big ba-da-boom
I'm going to _(correctly)_ assume Greg uses the silver play button to wipe his arse with.
So. Full hog roast for 10million then?
This is the appropriate thing to do with one of those youtube plaques. Now if only we can get Taskmaster NZ to allow their version to be posted on this channel.
Poor little Alex
Taskmaster is the best chill funny show. Thank you 💘
I don't know of another TV show that is so dedicated to its YouTube channel like you are. From the exclusive content to the genuine appreciation you seem to show for all of us here, you absolutely deserve a million!
Same Greg. Same
Happy 1 million! 🎉
So he does only eat roasts 🤣
Animal abuse isn’t comedy.
This is great
For anyone outside of UK who didn't know, you can watch the episodes on the Channel 4's site using a VPN service.
I love how carefull he was not to damage it with the fork, ya big softy
winner winner chicken dinner. someone on the production team plays PUBG 😂👍
Congratulations to the whole team.  Especially the editors
hmmm.... Chicken! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
TM has created a colorful fun and strategic environment that is always somewhat threatening and I am here for it.
So glad so many people have found this show. Every season is just as great as the last; I can always rewatch them and they're just as funny.
And about time too. Well deserved.
well deserved.
This is the best way anyone has ever celebrated their YouTube award.🤣 So much better than the usual bollocks of 'thank you so much guys, this is for you'. Fuck that. Eat some chicken.
Mmmm chicken indeed Greg! Mmm chicken!
They are surely aware that they can buy another Gold play button right? ;")
That chicken looked fucking amazing! I guess the award is cool and all but damn that chicken looked tasty!
Well deserved for the by far best TV show out there. To bad that 3 entire seasons (12 to running 14) are missing and also CoC II is missing. As YT is, afaik, the only platform where you can watch Taskmaster legally outside the UK.
Ah yes the time honoured tradition of saying something is the time honoured tradition despite the fact I've never seen someone using an award as a plate.
Right, now I'm subscribing
brilliant! cheers!!
In honor you should release the full last season on youtube
We can only guess that for the next award Lord Gregg will consume an entire ox on a spit. 🎉
Taskmasters is the only thing that has made me laugh so much I've peed myself.  A much-needed chuckle from bloody hard times.
Chicken à l'award.  Congratulations. 🥂
“Do something amusing with this YouTube award.  You have five minutes to plan your amusing thing, and five minutes to do it.  Your time starts... NOW.”
Happy million subscribers!
Congratulations to the both of you and the team. Thank you all for always keeping us so happy. Thank you Greg and Alex for being such amazing, inspiring, and wonderful people. I hope the both of you are doing well? 🍻❤️
The chicken did look pretty tasty.
You guys are aging like a fine wine!!! Take care of your health.
Congratulations on this well deserved milestone!
I mean... let's make sure Gregg'll have another chicken soon, right? Big boy is a hungry hungry fella!
I've seen many YouTubers do the craziest things with their Playbuttons, but this one takes the cake xD
YESSSS!!!!! Vindication! I hope more shows put there stuff out on YouTube to basically advertise and market for free, while receiving love/fan acclaim and extra money in return. Congrats on the 1 Million Taskmaster!
Lovely
Congratulations... for the delicious chicken;)
Absolutely well deserved.   If anything, A Knighthood should be bestowed on Little Alex Horne for creating a cultural classic that is now the benchmark of which, future gameshows that take comedians and puts them through heartbreaking and yet, pointless tasks for a cheap laugh and a fake gold head will now be judged.  Not to be outranked by a plebiscite, and finally realizing the role he was destined for, He shall be known forthwith as,  "Greg Davies, King, Emperor, All time Bad Ass, An incredibly Sexy Beast, Wearer of his mothers undergarments, (he was only a 30 yr old at the time to be fair) Judge, Jury, destroyer of Chickens, and The Supreme Ruler of the Kingdom of Taskmaster and probably Wales too."  Long live the King!!!
I'm glad for the all-mighty algorithm that recommended me a video on this channel one day, and then the rabbit hole I fell into after. It's great to see Taskmaster reaching more people!
What a fowl way to treat it. Congratulations!
Congratulations!! Thanks for creating this YouTube channel for us lot!
Felicitaciones 😁
I'm cackling. I had to take a double take when I saw Greg's plate dasbdasjjdah
damn greg you made me wanna eat nandos
Honestly, discovering Task Master during the pandemic really helped my mood and mental health so congratulations to the whole TM team! ❤️
🎉🥳🎉
since you now have 1m subscribers. Do we internation subscribers get rewarden with the newest taskmaster episodes?. Pretty please.....
So glad you guys started posting the eps to YouTube. As a Canadian I probably never would have discovered how awesome British TV is if I didn't have your channel to binge watch. I've discovered some of my favorite comedians through this show, and I've cried with laughter at quiet a few of the episodes. 'Just open the box pussy' and 'please don't take this away from me' being a few examples lol.
This was cute, love you guys
Alex Horne can actually play the horn.
Enjoy your Nandos Greg!
Taskmaster was really a great comfort to me during the peak of the pandemic and was one of the main things to bring alot of good laughs to me and my family. My sister owns the board game and its always nice knowing we can have some creative and ridiculous fun no matter whats going on .   Thanks for everything and i am glad you are getting the recognition you deserve. I hope you can bring some good times to other people like you did to me and my sister 👍
america love u
Yaay!
Mmm, chicken
Winner winner Chicken dinner
I'd assume there's an outtake where Alex finally snaps and attacks Greg with the hammer...then Alex is promptly broken in two.
this almost feels like a winner winner chicken dinner reference
Oh please, AS IF. Everybody knows Lord Davies eats chicken with his hands. Congrats ;)
Extremely cheeky Nando's
Congratulations to everyone!!!!! Love the show!
Thank you, Taskmaster team.   ❤❤❤ I binged the fuck out of it when entertainment was shut down. It really brightened my days.
wow youtube sent them chicken ok weird
Mmm... Chicken
The TNG "come!" is my favourite bit.  Congrats; hope you make some more Google commercials & keep getting that paper.
You guys are just killing this YouTube game! (In the best way possible)  Thank you so so much for the attention that you guys give this channel! Looking forward to a nice good pot roast on the 10 million!
Typical response from the powerful elites, a shat all over little YouTube by disrespecting their time honored traditions. Disgusting.
That is just such a Taskmaster thing to do.
But... Greg hates chicken on the bone... Did the Taskmaster's assistant screw up twice today?
Winner winner chicken dinner!
bruh
This for me is the most refreshing piece of television since the 90's, it's honest, does not take itself too seriously. And season after season manage to keep up the quality. I don't think ive ever laughed this hard on any show ive ever watched! Huge thanks to everyone involved for making life a lot more cheerful!
But you stopped uploading episodes?
Congratulations
I was introduced to the show by a coworker about I month ago, and since then I have binged every full episode you guys have uploaded to Youtube. Can't wait for the rest of the series to be uploaded here so I can watch them too!
Congratulations & may I add this is absolute perfection🤣
The show is such a fun watch. Your team rocks, thank you for uploading! :)
I don't know why, but them being in casual clothes makes this funnier.
Mchick is Korean for food
Poor chicken 🙁
Great video, but as much as I love Taskmaster, and I genuinely, honestly do, you'd probably get a lot more subscribers if you reverted to uploading each episode to the channel after it's aired in the UK, or at the very least after the full series has finished airing. When are non-UK fans going to get access to the most recent - and, presumably, future - series?
This is one of the more impressive things I've seen done to a YT plaque , lol
If only YouTube was allowed in the UK this could’ve happened sooner
I have to use a paper plate.
Was the chicken good?
perfection
A golden plaque means nothing to a man who gives out golden facsimilies of hiw own majestic head to mere mortals who complete meanliess tasks set by his groveling manservant...
I love the show.. I want to be happy for them.. but there's something really disheartening about a tv show getting the awards that were meant for small independent individual creators on a platform that exists solely because of and for users who didn't have the ability to entertain on largescale television.
Congrats, guys!
Now can you give USA viewers access to ALL of the past seasons/episodes? Pretty Please?!
No offense but if that is your dressing room it looks really lame.
Presumably at 10 million, turkey.
I started off just watching the individual tasks, but now I'm binging all the full episodes. Just finished series 8 yesterday. The show is fantastic! Thank you for uploading these to YouTube for a Canadian like me.
No, Alex, you're not going to smash this one and snort it.
Why were you using a knife and fork Greg? Your a wild animal.. fingers please.  🦍
This is, in fact, exactly how to do your million subscriber video. Well played folks, you've adapted to YouTube perfectly
Yes, that is chicken. Good job Greg.
Damn now I want some Nandos.
I don't know why this brings me such joy, but it does, so thank you.
Lovely
I'm the 1,000th like! Congrats guys, you deserve it. Love your program!!
I guess I am one in a million
It is completely plausible that Greg can leisurely consume a whole chicken
Cheeky Nandos
That looks like Nando's Chicken... Greg is forgiven.  And instantly that forgiveness is revoked because now I want Nando's chicken.
Finding Taskmaster helped so much during the pandemic, and still sometimes when I'm down I'll rewatch it! I've have cried with laughter! Cheers to more followers, more episodes and more extras 😉
Winner winner chicken dinner!!! 🍗😁
Oh, nothin'. Just ravaging a roast chicken on a golden plaque. What're you up to?  This is the sort of chaotic nonsense I need on a dreary fall morning.
The famously good catering. Nice
Good god, Alex is getting cheekier with every new subscriber! Thank god Greg is here to stample his ego into humility 🙏
No fancy comments here. I just love this show.
Eat the chicken, your time starts now 😂
I wish Greg would have chosen duck. Maybe in coconut sauce with a side of peas.
Lady Leshurr: Yes, enjoy the meal.
Congratulazioni!😁🎉🎉
this was so dumb... I love it lol
Congrats!! You guys have brought so much happiness to so many people during these rough times. Glad to see that the plaque is being used well haha
I expected nothing less from Greg, and I expect a full on Casserole for the 10m.
that felt like a fever dream
I don't know whether you've nailed the thank you video for your golden playbutton.. or completely misunderstood the assignment.. but I'm here for it! 😂 Congrats!
The plaque is at least 27% lead and cadmium. Not food safe.
That’s exactly what id do if i reached 1 mil lmao
very well deserved
You're welcome. Now share that damn chicken.,
So after the 1 million mark, we move from murdering eggs to murdering chicken, right?
Coincidentally that is Greg's 1 millionth chicken consumed this month.
Well, it's a plate after all
...was Greg eating Nandos on a YouTube play button?  I recognize that charcoal grilled abomination anywhere.
Congrats on the chicken and thank you for the many hours (I'd say days by this point) of entertainment.
It might sound like hyperbole, but TM is honestly one of the best game shows ever created. Congratulations Greg, Alex and all the team on 1M subcribers
Should have done what Kerry Godliman did with her Taskmaster trophy and just shoved their play button somewhere in the back of a dirty, old garage and forgot about it.
Like a homeopathic How To Basic! 😄
I thought the taskmaster didn’t eat chicken on the bone 😂
This channel is one of YouTube's absolute gems and deserves all the shiny metal-plated plaques it gets for Greg to have his fowl-based dinners on.
Are you okay Greg?
Congratulations. 5 points to both Greg and Alex. You guys are amazing.  I discovered your show during the Covid Pandemic when everyone had to stay at home. Since then you brought me hours and hours of pure joy. This is my absolute Favorite TV Show. I even watched some of the international stuff.   If I had one wish for the future I would wish for a competition for world champion of taskmaster with taskmaster contestants from different country's. Taskmaster Norway had some amazing contestants, like Kristoffer Olsen.  Greetings from Germany.
This is a true work of art. Congratulations Alex and team, it's well deserved!
Since you stoped uploading here, I have been forced into the pirate life, roaming the sea looking for the gold nuggets that are called "episodes". Congrats on the one million! Yarrr!
🍗
Congratulations 🎉👏
You know Alex, you COULD easily get to 10 mil if you upload the episodes like you used to…  Congrats tho
So with the million subscribers,  are you going to upload the other seasons?
gold plated.
Greg is the master of not giving fucks.
Thank you for everything you do on this channel Alex and team!!!! Without all your efforts, I would've missed out on this wonderful show from living on the other side of the world (Japan to be precise!) Here's to getting to 10 million subscribers and dozens more series!!!
Imagine how many subscribers you'd have if you would still upload episodes like you used to do.
I literally noticed last night that the channel passed a million. Been here since the first whispers of it existing went around on the subreddit.
Is that a vine reference?
Wth have I just watched😂
WTF! But awesome! HERES TO 10 MIL!
:⁠-⁠)
Cool. Now fess up the new seasons lol
It's uncanny to see them in normal clothes
ah yes, the time-honored tradition of doing anything with your award instead of putting it on the wall
In Greg's defence, that chicken looked fkin fantastic!
Congrats! 🥳🌈🎉
Hahahahaha
Well deserved ✌
Congrats Greg.
Interesting plate
