The 67 resemble 11:34
Yes more plz finish
I'm blue 7:05
12:30 so he Is talking with the "half-body" guy or?
I love this
I just realized you know how recently security breach, ruined, and secretly mermaid, came out with the data diver in the Pfizer, wrench what device in your left hand is the exact same Scott coffins just taking APs from fazbears, converse initiative, and then ripping off the one Scott size a good idea
laftoni baloni made me screech
Kanye West referance 0:04
Mark needs to be an asshole more often cause I see why people don't like him when he's struggling this hard to be so nice
My memory of this made an actual animation for the storyboard
13:13  me watching from AZ where is a cool 102 today 😎
Every FNAF fan: Springtrap DBD Fans: Springtrap Markiplier Viewers: L A F T O N I   B A L O N I
3 years and now the scott's aftonbuilt is coming soon
The camera’s on its way. Starting next week, you'll see every jump scare, rage quit, and real reaction. Get ready for TrueNorthTones with a face."
Jeez Mark was full on stupid with this one. 🤦
A ft on build
4:25 "Are you sure?"
:o
You’ve heard of Aftonbuilt, BUT WHAT ABOUT  PETERBILT???? GET DRIVIN
lafftoni baloni!!
Yeah its like when fan fiction writers start overwriting the characters to their OC’s and write their own stories.
The Foxy dog reminds me of AXL for some reason
16:33 oh goodness!
Crazy, I can’t be the only one that instantly thought that alarm was a microwave😂
helpppppppp why did they make afton hot
This needs to be finished… people forget that William IS a business man. This can finally tell us if his wife is real or not or if she’s in a suit
Markiplier: I'm blue. Me : Y O U R  B L U E  NOW
why are you shit loading someones crushed dreams😅
I’m not a moron
22:40 I love the Wreck it Ralph reference 😂
Clark Kimberly Young Christopher Johnson Sarah
Perez Gary Taylor Michael Allen Carol
That is why this is not canon, William never leaves the suit.
Ngl if the game had been finished/polished it probably would have been one of if not the best fan game
Young Ruth Martin Anna Wilson Scott
i like how markiplier is impressed more by a storyboard than an actual animation XD
The lord is coming back! Spread the gospel
Mark doesnt realize developers need to associate their game to fnaf get audiences. It is very hard to get players with an original game unfortunately.
Jones Angela Clark Kenneth Anderson Larry
This is like combining FNAF with Bugsnax
Laftoniboloni
4:22 it panned to that blurry map right as I took my near sighted glasses off and with my phone like 6 inches from my face, I thought I was suddenly far sighted
3:47 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87!
By the way. I don't think not being able to jump is not a glitch.   I think when you take enough damage you can't exactly project yourself 15 feet in the air any more.   Then after a bit, climbing is slow in general.   But when you heal up after a cool down, you regain the ability to climb then leap.
i fee like this game was fairly well executed for a demo, but conceptually it's very technical. i think its fun for storybuilding but as an actual game i would probably get bored of this very quickly. probably would've done better as a story or smthn idk.
LAFTONI BALONI'S LAFAPALUZZA
when i saw that feral Foxy robot... "Smash"
🖤🖤🖤
Is this the full game?
7:04 da ba dee da ba dai
Hiiii fnaffff kingggg
I know it's been very long but please dont have this mentality of "don't criticize demos" cause criticism is what devs expect from them 😂 they release demos so that ppl can give an opinion on the experience they have so that the full game is better
The majority of why the game doesnt work is mark not reading the tutorial
30:30 E
The funny thing is that I would know if the franchise came to Arizona because I live in Arizona
4:05 Laftoni-Baloni😭🤣 marks’s too funny
Got freaked out
😂
25:37 LMFAOOOO
I hope this game gets made
They labeled Louisiana as Mississippi in the maps 😂
Mark i need an update where'd you go?
Lol. 2023? That was last year 😅
jeez i thought mark was about to drop an A Serbian Film themed pizzeria on us at 3:25
If all goes bad the voices will be back in 4year to worst 8 years but if nothing happens to your channel in the time it takes no matter how long please return
Make a nather video on this please
Watching this now after seeing the direction FNaF is going in, this game would have been a perfect bridge into the future
The name of this game on its own sounds really cool and ominous , “AFTONBUILT”, but the gameplay and menus look genuinely great. Like it’s baffling how good this thing look.😊
I just realized that Mark posted this on my birthday :3
Just wanted to say thanks for doing what you do. There are days I get so depressed I don't even want to get out of bed, but watching your videos and the entertainment you provide truly help me keep the lights on, both metaphorically and literally.
The old fnaf games will never leave me.
Mark not understanding how the fanverse works but being supportive anyway is great
It looks more like a cattle prod than a taser.
That’s one resilient pupasaur.
38:50 Pitbull owners when king smiley wiley has finished ripping apart the entire kindergarten.
I had my finger at the top of the screen and it apparently sped mark up! I didn’t know so for like the first five mins mark was talking in x2 lol
Can you play cb's diner
It's not that you dislike the game, mark. It's that it needs a bit more streamlining before it is completely enjoyable. Loophole discovered..
hey, it's the last day that Afton Built could possibly be
I built what now
Mark when he sees his body: "Oh... I'm blue." Me: I'm blue Da ba di da ba die, da bi da die,
this artstyle..
Wh- a YEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING TO TIIIME
Something tells me Markiplier really hates whoever made this..
Cant wait for Marks next movie: Laftoni Baloni’s Laftapalooza
I thought my fire alarm was going off had to pause the video 😂😂😂
King Candy has been referenced. Amazing.
it's really sad how Scott approached this and I think he didn't consider how much time and effort was put into it in my opinion, he should've given the team a bigger chance, the way he suddenly changed his opinion was pretty wrong of him and I don't think I'm the only one with understanding for the team's frustration
rejected for not being british
8:53 anyone get SOMA vibes from that?
Fatbulut
Great standalone game idea, someone better steal this and just make this exact game as it is here but with different characters. I would play it and would not consider it unethical to pick up a dead game.
I love storyboards! Honestly I could watch a show that is just a storyboard and get really into it.
mark: you wouldnt punch a man with glasses would you? ignited bonnie: he wouldnt, but i would

laftonibaloni sent me to the next realm of reality
It took some thinking why this could've been cancelled and I just realized it might as well have been copyright reasons
a
Uh oh
Man i sure love it when Markiplier plays my favorite game called "Faftoni Baloni"
IN GARBAGE DISPOSAL THE JUNKYARD THING IS JUNKYARD FOXY
We could have had this, but no...we got Security Breach.
Wanna know why this was rejected
Fun fact: the title of the video is above markiplier profile so I read  Aftonbuilt Markiplier😂
The Laftoni Baloni bit sent me
in the Cut Scene the guy took Springtrap!
uhhh why does this only have 513 likes but 6.3 mil views
7:04 daba dee daba die
Mark was on the right to much on where he kept dying
puppy
im sorry “fanverse”?
well yeah I want to see laughtoni baloni's funtime sandwich emporium
could call it nonfat milk
am blue dabadibadaba
Mark brought me into this for no reason
works better than security breach tbh
I’d love to see this game finished properly
"IS THAT THE LAUGH OF 87'!?" -Markiplier (probably)
game starts at 4:14
MARK: *Doesn't read or follow tutorials* *Loses in game horrifically* MARK: "WHY DOES THIS GAME SUCK SO BAD??!?!
awesome game but mark has pottato brain
No read: but why are people constantly saying “Fazbear‘s Fright“ wrong? Like: “Fazbear Frights“ or: “Fazbear Fright“?
4:08 sounds like What a bunch of yippy dippy baloney (the guy from lego mvie)
That's not drippy cuz drippy is a bear that broken animatronic is a bonnie
Hey Mark, do you know how he was friendly at the end yeah buddy you pissed him off with that light😂😂😂
7:06 daba de daba die
the mississippi marker on the map looks solidly in louisiana
4:00 sounds like hes having a stroke while drunk lol
Someone finish aftonbuilt
Wow, that's the most beautiful "goodbye" I've ever seen.😊 props to putchie.
It's so strange hearing afton sound like that, but I love it. I always assumed he'd sound like the joker or smth but he just sounds like a normal dude :)
Yo! Someone broke into our shit and took our prized murderer mascot.
Mark can finish anything fact I'll bet my favorite shirt that uh  .....    who wants to get some pizza or is anyone up for Chinese food  ?
4:03
WARNING for everyone watching this in the dark, after 8:55 it's VERY bright for a few seconds! 😆
Mark ignoring the to-do-list in the top left corner of the screen and getting upset when not knowing what to do-
if only this was canon
i do believe he might have a problem with his keyboard in this vid because I watched someone play it and they had none of the problems hes having lmao
what a cute dog
Markiplier almost said b word
Yes, Aftonbuilt this
WHAT THE HELL IS LAFTONI BALONI?! ...at least if u can read you can see Afton in it...
Watching in 2023!
They should just turn this into their own thing, they don't need the Fnaf brand
idk why mark was just so bad at dealing with foxy but its funny
Thats the warehouse that burnt down when Henry battled Afton wasn't it?
30:53 bro’s abusing the dog thing 😂😂
What honestly does annoy me, is—whether he did the tutorial or not—he already—should have—known all that he needed to. @36:58 he opens his *_Objectives List,_* where it is _clearly_ listed that he's *already* removed all the tamper locks, and completely fails to read that he has *other* objectives to accomplish.  He _Assumes_ that this Foxy-pup will shut down when that's not the case, and somehow completely neglect that he's already dealt with it, despite looking for that very objective. Literally, all he had to do was read what he pulled up on his _own screen,_ to be honest. ...(  _　_ )ノ｜
even if it is cancelled by scott himself this stuff still has a better storyline than security breach
“Sneef” - Rat 2022
Such a missed opportunity for sure. The concept is amazing! The game play is amazing. I really wanna see a full version!! ❤😢 I know Scott had his own reasons but damn this would have been so cool. So many people also feel the same way i do! This could have gone so far! This could have added to the story line in such an amazing way. Cant get over it. Freaking sucks. We deserve this game.❤
Markiplier:Lixian,make me funnier Also Markiplier:*knocks animated lixian out*
So this is like soma mixed with fnaf
Bro kidnapped springtrap
Woah wait wtf How has it been a year-
It's funny how rough the cutscenes look and how rough the transitions are because it's an Alpha build   Because they still look and flow better than Security Breach
Remember Scott approved Security Breach, but thought this wasnt good enough.
Exactly how in the fuck can you do that fast without messing up?
I feel bad the other animatronics from the original fnaf games
So will there be a full version of this game?
Why is foxy acting like a dog?
wow... Scott sucks! i know he is helping other game makers make THEIR fangames, but what the hell Scott! This game is amazing and if he is worried about the merch.... just make plastic figures and shirts if your that worried. they don't have to be the same as everything else..... this game is amazing and i love how mark is also helping them slightly by telling them the same!
A few seconds in, the selections sound like when you zoom in and out in Wii bowling
How did we get from Aftonbuilt to laFtonI bALonI
this is the best fnaf fan game solely because you get to befriend an animatronic, and foxy out of all of them, yet hes known to be the most aggressive. i love the idea of having an evil robo dog become the goodest of bois. 10/10
i now want to make a game called laftoni baloni lolll
If u got scared by the intro ur a wuss.
I would 100% go to Latonis Balonis lalapalooza
Mark has the ability to take something thats supposed to be "scary" and make it funny.
At the 40 minute mark of this video there is a mini “is this loss” made out of dots and the fact that no one else has noticed it in the comments is weird 40:02
Laughtoni baloni is crzy
the game looks absoluteley wonderful, but i don't understand why they gave an option to ignore the tutorial, cause obviously people like mark are going to ignore it, along with the combo thing. it would be easier to just only be able to take a the remenant out when hes down instead of needing to do the combo  its an absoluteley beautiful game and it couldve gone so far, with or without the fanverse! i hope they end up coming back to this game.
"69 children missing at Laftoni Baloni's"
I wanna see a Sir Flubs a Lot Funfair and Laftoni Baloni's Laugh a Palooza fan games please
IS THAT THE BITE OF LAFTONI BALONI!?
Damn, that Foxy model was killer. Too bad it seems like the project got scrapped.
i love laftoni baloni
This shit looks better than sb in every way
Laftoni Baloni
I actually kinda like this storyboard style for some reason though with the cutscenes..
i thought it said aftons butt
so this game would be happening in real time right now if Scott didn't reject it I'm honestly really sad because with what Foxy looked like, imagine all the other animatronics OH GOD ORVILLE WOULD BE HUGE
Mississippi is marked dead in the middle of Louisiana😂😂😂
This game needs to be made
idgaf about no damn "fanverse" this looks better than most fnaf fan games... aside from those cutscene if im being honest
I love how the game gave him an objective list and he ignored it
I guess they didn't have enough budget to do an animation cutsene
I am a lion
This had to die for security breach
Is there a fnaf or fnaf fan game where you play as one of the animatronics? I feel like that would be a good and fun concept
Ah yes, I love watching mark skip the tutorials then ignore the objectives. He never learns
lixian is the best thing to ever happen to mark ever
25:51
I love this game and everything about it except for one thing that has always bothered me. Isn't William british?
revisiting a year later and i gotta say... this version of William Afton sounds incredibly American for Afton being an Englishman. The game's pretty solid and it's a shame Scott didn't let it into the Fanverse but hearing Willy as an american broke my immersion almost instantly lol  i know there's only so much game devs can do, especially when the game isn't even finished
Already a year ago? Really?! WTF
I knew an artist who was part of this project. they did the cutscenes from what i remember, as well as concepts i think?
....this looks like the ruin dlc
I would love to see this get completed and put on game jolt for free, it’s so sad at what became of this.
I think FNaF revolutionized the horror game scene, however, it also ruined any chances of an animatronic subgenre to exist, even after it has long fallen out of popularity. Even if a game's only similarities with FNaF are that it is a horror game and its main characters are animatronics, it'll still be thought of as a FNaF fan game in the backs of people's minds.
38:25 - when my ex asks me how she looks after cheating on me with 2 fuckin dudes and still wants us together because "she can't live without me in her life."
Honestly, scott should've made this canon
If anyone reads this Mickey afton just guessed the fnaf movie trailer date
Amazing
This hits different on the second watch. Boy, rope-a-doping Doggo Foxy looked like such hard work. Such a tiny window of opportunity to hit him! Such a big junkyard for him to be distracted by too. I really love the concept and ideas though. Shame Scott didn't go for it.   Longtime viewer here. Thanks so much for all of your content. Can't tell you how much it's helped me through the years.
laftoni baloni.
I CRUING AT THE WAY HES LIKE "U CALL IT SIR FLUBSALOT FUN FAIR. U CALL IT FATONBUILT. YOU CALL IT ONFATBUIT"
bro is acc playing a prkour game
I'm blue abadiba da die 7:05
Actually the “ending” of taming the monstrous feral fox robot might make for a interesting beginning for a Post Apocalyptic game
The fact that Scott Cawthon rejected this but then procceeded to create security breach bewilders me to the highest extent
I disagree with all of you people
Came back at the year this games current year lol
Here to finish the title Aftonbuilt different
4:03 fail button?
To anyone wondering, the reason this game was rejected is unclear. The developer says it was because his scope was too great and Scott was still touchy after Steel Wool fucked Security Breach thanks to massive over-ambition and taking too damn long. The version you see here was never meant to be published because it was so unfinished. Without the funding to develop the game beyond this point though, I guess Liam threw up his arms and said "fuck it."
2023
2:16 It took me a second glance to realize that that’s SpringDrip or someone similar to him.   2:37 And it took a bit before noticing that either this person is wearing a absolutely destroyed glove or they’re hand is decayed.   (I’m only this far into the video so idk if this is revealed to be Mike or something)
Anyone remember years ago when Mark said he would stop playing FNAF fan games? Well look at him now. Playing fan games left n right, honestly it's really good he didn't go through with that.
You should play Rakuen🌸💗🌸 It is a beautiful and heartwarming story set in Japan. 🌸💗🌸 You would love it. 🌸💗🌸
You should check out Bugsnacks 🌸💗🌸 It is a great game with amazing characters and it is full of mysterys to solve. You will love playing it🌸💗🌸
You should play In Sound Mind🌸💗🌸
You should play Asuras wrath with the original Japanese voices. It's a classic game that barely anyone knows about 🌸💗🌸
And fredees
At five nigts
How are you to good
Lol
7:05 Mark: "I'm blue" Me: "...Da ba dee da ba di, da ba dee da ba di, da ba dee da ba di"
mark bro u can play phasmophobia... if u like it of course
Mark you really must read the tutorial and I am right cause you will know what you need like floodlight:it is used to stun enemy's but beware as it can accidentally stun you if you touch the laser and you must use the detonator when it is on the view of the sticky stun thing? That is what the cam for but you move wasd for control of the cam also the bug where you can't continue to press the buttons due to that bug it's because the animatronic is currently stuck as it doesn't chase you meaning it is bugged due to that I don't know why and I don't care
If I read this right, scott pissed himself seeing the game and rejected it
As I watch this more. This has a lot of Security Breach elements but in different tones. You have to dismantle animatronics with the help of another animatronic.
i am so mad this game was never finished because the premise is so fucking good and i would have totally bought and played it
I understand why Scott turned it down. Be bad if a fan game outshined a base game right before it released. Talking about Security Breach. It feels like the two would've came out at about the same time. But what about now? Can they start working on it again now and it be a base game? Games do stuff like this all the time, they don't have to be released in order. Especially now, lore gets added everyday and it takes place at different times. I'm excited to see what they do for the movie. Is it gonna be based on the bite of 87? Follow Georgie or Max...I forgot the kid's name in Security Breach. Or a whole new addition? Fnaf started small and is going far on an original idea that has inspired millions.
you call it built built
He mentioned 2023 and it wasn't that then the game was made
7.07 dabadeedabadai
It's a shame that this game was rejected. I might even say that this unfinished version of the game is better than the entirety of security breach.
The first jumpscare made my -5 year old dad have an epilectic seizure
Mark, the dog tamer
I absolutely love the artstyle of the storyboards. They make me feel happy :D
this video ended so friendly lol
Waiting for someone to make Laftoni Baloni's Laffa Palooza.
back watching this in 2023
The title changing with so much confusion while Markiplier blabbered so many mock names 3:47 at is sending me-:
I’d rather have hand drawn cutscenes than really glitchy animated ones.
33:48 hahaaa
Mark you need to check out post shift it's amazing
Markiplier ignoring the tutorial? 😂😂😂
I wonder if part of the issue was how much lore this game would have established should it have been accepted as part of the fnaf world.
AutoBuilt
Laftoni Baloni's lafapolusa
Is it weird that i think afton sounds hot?...      Edit:I don't mean it in a weird way its just the voice
Did anyone recognize the scooper from sister location?
im ngl watching mark make the exact same mistakes over and over again, then blaming the game is a little annoying
Markiplier I appreciate what you're talking about with changing names and calling it an original concept but speaking as a FanFiction writer its not about the story being salable, its about the thing we were inspired to make.   Don't make it sound like the person did themselves a disservice by chosing to make a fan project. It doesn't demean the work for it to be derivative.
what ever happened to this game? did the creator get pissed and give up on this cause of what mark said????
Its fnaf meets monsterhunter ik cool to the animatronics soo free
I am not surprised that Mark gets jump scared by springtrap !!
nice
foxy dog
The fire alarm in the cutscene gave me an absolute heart attack because I’m home alone and I made grilled cheese earlier😭😭
4:02
foxy is too damn cute at the end, it makes me so happy that they made it to where he was a friendly little pooch at the end lol I used to draw him as a happy dog all the time when fnaf 1 came out, this absolutely made my day. 😍
The one game he doesn’t ignore tutorials
why is the dog foxy kinda cute
POV: the video takes place in 2023 and you’re watching it in 2023
i'm pissed that this could not be pursued anymore, i would have called this my favourite game, Cawthon why...why.... We should have boycotted fnaf games just in retaliation imo but i feel it wouldn't help
I don’t see why this was rejected
I don't know why, but Mark ignoring the tutorials, then getting mad at the game because he couldn't figure out on his own that the detonators are line of sight, kinda infuriates me. Mark tends to do this a decent amount of the time tbh. He'll ignore entire sections of a game, often the tutorial, but he'll also sometimes ignore crucial lines of game dialogue that tell him what to do because he's too busy commentating, then get upset that he doesn't know how the game works or what to do. I know he's an entertainer, that you need to commentate to be a gaming YouTuber, and failing at games is funny and entertaining for the viewer, but Mark getting mad at the game and then criticizing the developer on something that is 100% Mark's fault is unfair to the developer and creative team. This is something Mark does more often then I think he should.
I love how I'm watching this in 2023.
33:16 o my god
according to the dev for those who dont know: "Due to Scott declining Aftonbuilt for the Fazbear Fanverse, we don't have the budget to properly finish the game and make it as good as we wanted it to be."
Markiplier is the type of guy who can somehow bug the game and the monsters turn good
Lol i'm watching this in 2023
Mark making out with Drippy is definitely the highlight of this video.
the corator was fond with CP  and if you do not know what CP is YOU ARE CLEAN
idk why but you remind me of my music teacher
My transition goals is to sound like this man.
WE NEED TO CROWDFUND THIS OR SOMETHING  SERIOUSLY WE NEED IT FINISHED IT COULD BE SO GOOD
I hate how normal Afton sounds, but like, I KNOW what this motherfucker did. He's so friendly and helpful. Characterizing him this way makes him scarier. It makes me wonder about who he was able to manipulate and trick with charisma/charm.
Dying light parkore
Wait wait wait 2023 is that what William said? Oh shit
Idk how or why but I watched this before I knew can’t lore and now that I have rewatched it it all makes sense I was so confused on remnant before and why a dude was talking out of a keypad but now I get it
3:47 - 4:10 Oh Oh, I know!  PHANTOM BUILD This is now officially the cannon game name.
nah cause this game wouldve been so much better than security breach
Oh man. I'm so sad that this game isn't going to be finished T_T I love the concept and it looks awesome
There´s a connection between this video and the platform Moneyeasily.......
It’s 2023
7:06 🎶Bah dah dee dah doo die If I were green I would die-🎶
39:00 is just mark getting happy over a puppy  like a white woman finding the most dangerous animal on the planet and some how taming it
THE ENDING LMAOO 😭😭 the way mark just made up with foxy even after wrestling with them for the whole video
4:10 “Laftoni Baloni’s Lafaplooza!” -Markiplier 2022
still patiently waiting for you to try out Day Shift At Freddy's.
Afton: Lets look at the calendar.... hmm..... 2023- Me: *who actually exists in 2023* 🤨👀
around 14:30 ~~ i feel like this is a subtle reference to both the fnaf tapes (bonnie's reaction to seeing a picture of afton or what i assume was afton) and sister location (idk something about the player being michael and i guess this is going with the assumption michael heavily resembles his dad) -- i can't explain this fully but it just feels like a reference to it.
the fact that afton voice is so smooth and idk, the way it is, but knowing what he's done is so strange. props to the voice actor!
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘👍👍👍
Mark: Flashing lights, loud noises and jumpscare warning me: Meh, jumpscares never get me me one second later (literally): OH MY GOD, I SAW JESUS
11:58 ... that's cool
omgosh when it said hmm 2023 .... RUUUUUUUUNNNNNN haha
Hast du geschrien?
Bist du gestorben?
It’s afton year! 🎉
“This video was sponsored by Laugh Tony’s Baloney”
I paused it at 0:09 when he said "jump scares" then put on my earbuds. Not kidding, I JUMPED!! He got me
Mark will be a great person to brainstorm with.
ITS 2023 NOWWWWWWWWWWW
Watching this in 2023 🎉
Me watching this in 2023
tbh the intro is pretty much just Kwote making sure his senpai is okay after the fire FNaF 3 ended on
It claims that the date is 2023, and it’s less than 2 days until 2023 at the time I’m watching this. Whadya know
hi harry
i almost died at that jumpscare, lukckly my mom knew CPR. My heart stopped
This game is already better than security breach without it even being finished
This is very enjoyable to watch and gives me something to watch when I'm bored.
I’m so glad Scott rejected this stupid fan game! I don’t why anybody would like a game with glitches!
bruh yeag
A small little Easter egg in the Junk jard at 18:19 is that the Fredbear model used is from final nights 4
At 26:47 my soul left my body 😭
Play MADiSON
Holy crap! it’s Vincent as the main character, glad to see him in a fnaf game
I love Five Night At Freddy s whit Markiplier
These cutscenes look much better than even the finished comic endings that security breach had 😭
Is that the real laughTony
A
Absolutely no one. Mark spamming the shit out of his keyboard💀💀
How tf is this rejected
Hey mark is it possible that if you make the horror games brighter
im sad that this game wont be finished, it had so much potential
CHICKEN WING CHICKEN WING LAFTONI BALONI CHIKN AND MACROSONIE
Humans will pack bond with anything
Honestly I can just imagine how beautiful it will be when the cutscenes are finished it would probably be a amazing and immersive experience:)
SIR FLUBSALOTS FUN FAIR. I LIKE IT!
Mark: I'm not feeling particularly lustful...   Also Mark: *makes out with a broken animatronic*
He broke the game
when i say laftoni baloni's laughapalooza had me SHEDDING TEARS laughing 😩
"LAFTONI BALONI"- Mark "FOXY-DOG" - Also Mark
marks continuious Laftoni Baloni but kills me over and over again, Mark!, let me breathe damn it!
Mark should make a game
9:00 FLASHBANG OUT
I'm blue dabadebadodi
origin of glitchbun/trap /bunnywise
38:47 I love how the game bugged and Mark just decided to adopt the doggo Foxy. What an unexpected wholesome outcome to this fiasco.
This takes place next year?! Wow
No stop bcs that stuff about making your own individual game made me tear up a bit, I want to be a game dev but I have no one to work with, no budget and no knowledge, I know it’s not a lot but just hearing someone who plays games I feel I could only ever conceiving say that means the world to me, maybe I’ll try again
mark you did the ojetive over like 2000000000000000000000000 times do the next one but that was funny
Basically you had to keep tapping the button repeatedly cuz It said times next to the number of how much have to press the keys on the computer
sometimes markiplier looks like jackie chan - 39:25
monster hunter but its fnaf fan game
I have no idea what this big project thing is but the intro gives me feels that I feel like no other work of fiction has managed to touch before.   Fnaf is honestly not just a gift for fan theorists, but for fan fictions. People who wanna build on the story in their own way, change some things, focus on certain elements, go dark, go cute, whatever, it’s like a buffet for people who wanna tell a story. It’s kinda like how mangle is a pull apart put together contraption but you take a piece and you just go, run with that idea. The best part is you can actually show people what you can make from it, show everyone just how creative you can be when you take an idea and a theme and just run with it.   It’s so fun to show people how creative you can be and I really can’t think of any other work of fiction that has done something like this. Whether it’s from possibly changing the story as he went or just how many themes he put into the series, Scott has given us a wonderful gift that I feel like people are gonna be making fan stories about it for years to come. I’ve never had this much fun playing around with the story, I didn’t even know I had that itch to begin with but it feels so good
Shame that this wasn't accepted, looked pretty cool
Just to clarify even if you decide to not believe it, the game was denied for more than it being complex or ambitious, it wasn't original enough as far as assets and story goes. You can see reused FNAF 1 models and it's a spin off story to FNAF 3. Games like Candy's have unique models, story and new characters. I agree with Mark and many others in that they should just make original characters and sell the game. Unfortunately they were banking on the funding from Scott instead of going out there to do a kick starter, to be fair kick starters are risky nowadays, but the gameplay is fun in concept and they are skilled enough to polish it given the time to do so, and the story can be intriguing if they make it uniquely there own with original characters.
Terrifying
this vid was on my bday
I can see how this did not became part of the fnaf fanverse, it is far too complicated of a concept, the story and mechanics are so difficult to understand and so badly explained.  The game would be fantastic if only they had invested more in better tutorials and a more coherent storyline.  The fact that the demo has so much content on graphics, levels and mechanics and leaves out tutorials and skill progression goes to show the reason why to Scott's eyes this project would be unsuccesful: ambition.
Damn this game so good please play more when you can ❤️❤️
Honestly, even the storyboard cutscenes have a kind of charm. Like, all they'd need to do is put in a few extra frames between each shot to smooth it out and it would be totally passable.
I get what mark was saying abt FNAF fan games but I think he forgets that alot of people still are big fans if the series and are greatly inspired by the story and world of it
Oh boy Glitchtrap
Nice editing with the titles Lixian! BEAUTIFUL!!  11:46-11:48 Don't like that.. 20:15 There's something creepy about "Run Off" being right over Freddy's head..
Foxy is A GOOD BOY YES HE IS!!!
Mark Desperately trying to remind creative people they don't always have to write fanfics.
Honestly, I liked the video even before I watched it because I just know that this video is going to slap either way
Actually, Scott would love for you to make a fan game of him. In fact, he might even fund it. However that's the reason he sold FNaF. For some reason people were giving him shit for funding fan games because their toxic af. Why it's so bad to keep your fanbase alive is 4 parallel universes ahead of me, so why Valve doesn't get that shit is concerning to me.
If there isn't a fan-game based on this fan-game called "Laftoni's Baloni", I won't be mad. I'll just be disappointed.
I hope the creator feels the love we have for this game 💙
Just a bad concept. It's like someone just saw that "hack the drone" mechanic that was popular in so many of the 2012-2016 shooter games and thought to themselves let's make an entire game of just that.
13:05 PICK UP THE FAX reference?
Lixian is the best editor in the world I sweae
drippy wake upp~ i dont like this.. drippy wake uuupppp~
Yo mark how do you feel about rush E
The potential in this game is incredible. I understand Scott's got his reasoning but goddamn is this a missed opt.
Jumpscare did not get me.
8:55 I WAS ON MY PHONE AT NIGHT YOU SON OF A B
Purple guy 😱😱😱😱😈😈💜💜
Wish the ai unbugged itself when Mark was close to it that would have been funny but it fixed itself a few secs to late XD Edit a little bit of refinement reskin and not ignoring the turtorial and this game could be real good
You know what I don't like about me   I always watch this kind of games  But I most of the time don't hear someone speaking it's just a kind of fast play And then I see one of my fav YouTubers play it  And then I'm mad cause I already know how it Will go😑
Love how Mark was motivating people to make horror games ( in a way ) I have a few good ideas on what games would be cool and the story and characters in it But not a very good coder no idea how to make a half decent game 😐  Anyway love your vids Mark keep it up 👍
Mark said Hewwo, confirmed furry
Lixian and mark duo is my favorite
Love this Mark! Keep up your amazing content!
In the final u got a new friend.
daddy daddy
* clap sounds*
LMAO
someone has to make sir flubs a lot fun fair games rn
He  sonic
"All the kids LOVE Laftoni baloni!" **scratches beard**
From what i've heard, apparently the creator CAN'T flesh this out into a full thing unconnected from the FNAF franchise for whatever reason, apparently there is a whole lot of rights stuff involved and Scott kept telling them that he wouldn't give the game proper funding if it didn't meet certain criteria but it was stuff the creator didn't want to do but tried to make something that Scott would approve of that satisfied the both of them but in the end, Scott didn't agree to fund the project and the creator had already sunk so much time and resources that they couldn't do anything else with the project, not even start over from the top, or i think Scott said that due to rights and stuff, that since the concept was already sold to Scott, even though he isn't going to do anything with it, the creator can't flesh this out into anything anymore because Scott still owns the concept or something even though he won't fund it because of murchanidising issues and... It's really just a whole thing, if i am being honest, i don't remember all of it and i am not saying anything about anyone in particular, but it's kind of a bit of a messed up situation and now this game is frustratingly stuck in limbo forever.
Is mark in this game?
did anyone else see that the van has to shifters on stick shift and one on the celom hmmmm....
cat no banana  angy(•ˋ _ ˊ•) cat no banana!  she not like the banana angy cat no banana!!
If the devs ever figure out how to finish this game, I feel like it has a chance of being one of the best fnaf fan games ever right next to tjoc or fnac.
I would love to get behind that game and be apart of it
Z
Hey is that big scoop thing from sister location??
Call of duty: 1987
ok i need a lafftooni and flubsallot game
I'm so sad that there will never be a full game, I would 100% play it
a
It reminded me of that one fanmade FNAF 3 trailer where the events took place in the abandoned mall.
This may only be a proof of concept demo, but it's better than all of Security Breach
It said "In sight", you can only detonate it IN sight, the explosion thingy is out of sight, I know he probably knows this but it just annoys me a bit
i understand why Scott didn't like it
the ending was just on point
Built stupid.
That thumbnail looks amazing.
markiplier just stuttering with different types of titles was hilarious. Good content, continue the work! :)
Quick question, what’s the name of the animatronic in the thumbnail ?
Someone watching this is now currently working on Sir Flubbs-a-lot lol
1:05. Is it just me, or does that look like the Tack Shooter in Bloons but with an A on it?
Laton built
Our universe 2 is for alligator chopper
"Scary." FNaF is as scary as Amy Schumer is funny.
he definitly had caps lock on while he tried to get the right letter to press
Marks editor is just the best editor ever lmao 😂 I mean he kinda just ads random stuff in ever now and again
omg drippy😭
I’m blue badadedadadadadaddadeda 😌
I really like a lot of the ideas here. The cat-and-mouse potential of a fast-paced trap-based horror game is huge.  I've always fancied the idea of Afton as the 'bad' against the animatronics 'worse,' and making him the man in the chair to the players animatronic hunter could be very cool. It wouldn't even be too much of a stretch to give him a psuedo redemption, as being killed by your victims' ghosts that you didn't believe in before experiencing the horror you put them through is solid grounds for a perspective shift. No where near enough for an 'I'm a good guy now' but more than enough for an 'I must stop what I began' thing.
Can say, The phoenix bit is pretty accurate, things dont last long here lol
You are awesome and I really love your videos and they are so awesome
This game is reminding me of the time I had an idea for a animatronic gamea while back. Basically, it was in a abandoned theme park and their were good animatronics and evil ones the good helped you the evil tracked you down to kill you. And their were things you could collect to help you escape and things you could find to help you defend yourself ect ect, in conclusion lol I'm looking for someone to help make this idea a reality! Anyone know anyone I could go to?
I like how Mark keeps screaming "I will not shit on these crushed dreams" but all of his screaming, struggling and frustration at the mechanics kinda shits on it by default. Not to say the finished product couldn't be good, but at its current state I'd understand people shitting on the experience.
still confused if it was glitched, or that's how you take it over..?
Yes it doesn’t have to be fnaf related, most fan games don’t have to, but people love fnaf and want them to be fnaf related. They could definitely be stans alone but the creators don’t want them to, they want them to be related to fnaf in some way
Creation of glitchtrap?
Anyone else getting Subnautica/Al-An vibes? Unknown entity in your PDA giving you instructions and all that?
L A F T O N I B A L O N I
2:01 freaked me out, thinking my smoke detector was going off.
I feel like this games heart is in the right place, but its focusing on all the wrong aspects of game design. Like why is there a full loading screen with a modeled van and the time of day changing, but the character themselves doesn’t have a model? That seems backwards.
Mark: Oh theres a foxy dog! Mark (at the end) : Oh who's a good boy?! *mwah* *mwah* :D
11:27 “you seem to be quite smart…” mark: *climbs porto-potty*
Maybe it hurts just a little more every time you say that this game is a game of crushed dreams...
I blinked and missed the jumpscare lol
Wait a minute that foxy how he still alive and he kill human I'm just thinking guys anyway ur the best Markiplier
"Put a bomb on the button! That feels right!" My brain: "I've yet to meet a problem that can't be solved with explosives."
Sad how this was kicked out of the fan-verse. ;-;
Wait. Isn’t Fazbear Frights the real name of place in fnaf 3
That dog was trained, he said bye to us 41:18
I guess this was supposed to explain what happened between 3 and pizzeria simulator
hey Mark I just wanted to say congratulations on In Space With Markiplier it was awesome I loved every second Space stuff is my favorite 💙
Can you do the other ones that are left please this one was great and I see you didn't continue Afton Built fnaf game please continue for the CONTENT I A HIGE FNAF FAN SO PLEASE SO THE OTHER 3 THAT ARE LEFT PLEASE
Hahaha “ehhh Scott might not like that very much”
5:31 thank me later
i think this game definetely has potential if this is only the beta but what i think that holds it back is its based on fnaf it could totally pass as mark said a game with its own story
can we take a moment to appreciate that the soundtrack in the beginning cutscene SLAPS
such a cool concept, i wish this game had been able to go ahead :(
this game looks cool
We want this Scott!
Game: Aftonbuilt Youtube in description: Five Nights At Freddy's Me: good job YT Game identifier
This is either some egregiously bad gameplay, signposting, or both. This looked like a fucking miserable experience.
I guess the game would add so much confusion to the Lore but... It's still such an amazing fan game-demo... UGHHHH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT AND PLAYED IT TOO IF IT WAS FINISHEDDDDD
Still more polished than security breach.
I have a game idea, but I'm wayyyy to lazy to bring it to life 😭💀
Mark is are lord, king and saviour of fang and anything he does wrong in fnaf we love also when he is scared ❤️
Mark fr completed the hardest objectives and failed to finish the game cause he didn't look at THE OBJECTIVES LIST
Mark: "I dont know what else im supposed to do" ME: LOOK AT THE OBJECTIVES?????????
hey I have my own youtube channel and I was wondering If you were interested In a collab
I love that he talked for a while about artistic originality. It's OK to like something a lot and want to make fan creations. But honestly you'll get more recognition for creating something of your own not just adding to someone else's idea
i actually have ragdolls of the models in the game and it is in gmod
This game looks so polished. Well done to the developers!
mark im gonna remeber laughtony boloni for ever until i make a game
20:56 me when I'm at Cape Canaveral
Laftoni Baloni  My mind went directly to Tony Bamanaboni
Honestly? I like the idea of a storyboard opening! It's different, it's not just a cutscene, and a rough storyboard can have its charm. But I might be saying this as someone that draws a lot, and I like seeing how an animation is made, so seeing the steps of creating it via storyboard is fascinating to me.
anyone else also cooing at docile foxy with mark? he’s just such a good little doggo
Why Scott Cawthon rejected this game: Scott said that it was “too much of a risk” because the pitch/game itself was just simply too ambitious. And he wanted simple fan games that were easily marketable and easy to turn into merch + Alot of the people making the game left because Scott strung them along for two years and the main developer was running out of money cause Scott was ignoring him, and he was paying the salaries and his own bills out of his own pocket and got frustrated at Scott for how he ignored them and strung them along for two years.
This game definitely has potential to be separate from fnaf
This game is really testing his rage management. I can see him struggling to not rage.
Anyone else thinks little robot sounds like mark ? No just me
Foxy's a cat now because he's standing like a cat and acting like a cat
"Mickey's pizzeria"   Actually there is a fnaf fan game with mickey and other disney characters and its actually kinda popular i dont remember the game's name tho so
Did I just hear Mark say, "I think I need the tutorial?"
Ah yes, my favorite games       Laftoni Baloni and Laftoni Balonis Laughaplooza
Mark you should play project reajusted games!!!
2:49 That one kid in your group assignment who didn't contribute at all
I want to believe Scott denied this game not because he found to project too ambitious, but rather that he saw potential, like FNaF had potential on the first game, and didn't want it stapled as "A FNaF fangame" but rather maybe someone that could make their own franchise. The guy that made this has some serious talent.
Mark rage quiting fnaf☠️
i love how mark keeps encouraging fnaf fans to make their game an original one and sell it instead of spending countless hours on a fan game just for it to be free. and i kinda agree now with how bad scott handles communication. i wouldnt want to rely on someone that's working everything singlehandedly.
Mark refusing to read, constantly failing and getting upset because of it isn't exactly entertaining when he keeps doing it again and again. C'mon mark...
Mark: I will not kick someone when they're already down! Also Mark: 30:24
5:34 is the funniest reaction I’ve ever seen 😂
laftoni baloni
Bruh. I’ve always thought that a Titanic ( based off the 1997 movie) would be a good FNAF combined game. I’ve made art of it, too
this vid coulve been called "Laftoni Baloni"
Scarier than Security Breach.
It's upsetting that scott basically screwed with the dev instead of being clear and caused the studio to waste tons of money for a game they thought was getting in the fanverse because scott changed his mind right before they were about to sign the contract.  bad communication on scott's part.
OH DAMN Markiplier needs a room with something that he doesn’t know
OH DAMN Markiplier needs a room with something that he doesn’t know
6:06 i got scared how close he got to that thing and was expecting a jumpscare
I could eat at Scott’s Tots any day
It's way too late for the devs to see this, but... the original Donkey Kong was supposed to be a Popeye game. They were rejected, they reskinned it, and it gave birth to one of the most successful game franchises in history. True beauty and success can come from crushed dreams! Wish you guys the best
I find it kind of frustrating that Mark keeps saying "Doesn't need to be FNAF themed."  Cause while that is definitely true, it can be insanely hard to get a kickstart on your own. Making an original game and having it be noticed isn't an easy feat. Along with the fact this was made for a contest from Scott Cawthon.   There's just a lot that's sorta upsetting is all, hurts my feelings as a creator who struggles to gain attention without making fan works
on the map it says mississippi but its on louisiana
This is a pretty cool looking game I’m kinda sad that it was rejected, but the fanverse is controlled by Scott so it’s completely up to him.
everyone after seeing a horror game loading:that game is suppose to have FLASHLIGHT!now how am i gonna play this S H I T (e) g a m e???
so frotnit epik
i got a 37 minute ad. what’s youtube doin
ITS A markiplier
Aftonbuild, The FNAF Fan Game that  Scott Rejected, But still a great FNAF  Fan Game, I like the way this Game its!
Funny fact, I actually dreamed of this happening a week before the game came out.
Can someone actually make a game called Laftoni Baloni? For Mark?z
.
So Scott didn't fund the game because he saw it as "too risky" and too ambitious of a project for a team to do. This was the build that was presented to Scott which means that he saw it, played it, and still rejected it despite being such a strong presentation.
No wonder the game got rejected. It uses audio from Half-Life 2
the half of the video was him sayin Laftoni Baloni
Someone should make a FNaF fan game about sir flubs a lot fun fair
Unfortunately, it also has some silly scenes that just make you want to shoot the whole movie in your head.
I want to play this game but it don't want to launch
This looks like it was made in dreams
I love the game's concept, it looks amazing and in a way I actually find it scarier than Security Breach. I love how the game barely has jumpscares and instead has a health system.  If Scott isn't going to fund this game then I hope someone else one day does, maybe with some hope the developers will one day be able to develop this into a full game. I think this deserves to be a full game.  It's kinda depressing hearing it's a game of crushed dreams, I see so much potential in this project.
William Laftoni?!
38:43 - To the developers of this demo, can we make this a official ending of the game? Cus let's be honest, this is all we'll be thinking about from that moment! (Markiplier X Aftonbuilt Foxy)
laftoni boloni
Tbh,I think Scott didn't want this game part of his franchise because he felt it was gone be bigger then his games,now hear me out,fnaf 1-4 was great,but after them,they died down,sister location was some what scary but didn't have that atmosphere of terror that fnaf 1-4 delivered,now you can come for and say I'm this and that,but the fact still stand that after 4,all the fnaf games started getting watered down,only being scary in vr(and yes I've played them all),at the end of the day,he let all these other games that were trash asf,be part of the franchise,but not this one?that's odd,this game was so scary I couldn't go a min without about to jump out my pants,literally,my pants fell off my waste from one of them Jumpstart dropping my phone in the process,I think that's a big spit in the face that Scott denied this game but let them trashy games be part of the franchise,and I know he's never going to admit it,or say the reason,but deep in my heart and soul,I feel,and know if I was him,I would've let this game be part of my franchise,this game has soo much potential,and to just denie it like that,that must hurts,especially if you don't know how long this person been working on this game like dam scott,you couldn't give a reason at least,let's not forget fnaf sister location,wtf was the story line,wtf did the ending have to do with fnaf?lmfaoo you got it bro.
3:46 hardest I've laughed in a while
“Laugh tony beloni”
I want to see more of this.
wow this is a garbage demo. fitting it takes place in a junkyard
Markiplier this movement is so good *Also Markilplier* : What is this movement
Bro i realised he hasn’t played onaf 3 yet
The song in the opening cutscene is a BOP
I absolutely love this game.
3:47 LMFAAAOOOO
no cuz why afton crucified like jesus h christ
that jumpscare right before the outro got me
So technically Markiplier likes the game maybe even love the game he just is very upset about some of the stuff but he doesn’t want to crush dreams of this Fnaf  fan game
Afton coming back to life: Ah yes time to begin step 9809248 of my plan Mark: why did i make out with that
will there be a part 2 T_T
As cool as this game is, i can kinda see why it wasn't accepted. It just doesn't capture the same feel as the previous games and its a little too complex,, yk, with the bombs
its da scooper
If bread in French is pain… THEN I OWN A F%#$&*ING BAKERY✨
If this was accepted I feel like this could’ve fixed a few plot holes in SB…
Laftoni baloni
i want more
The Timer of dissembling the remnant Doesn’t Reset, it only just increases by the time you solved it-
That's a great thumbnail.
I'd like to see Mark play Dormitabis and not piss himself lel
It took me a while but if you notice, the little eyes on the ipad Afton uses to talk with, the little eyes are synced to him
imagine how cool it would be being little lix, being lixans kid must be so cool
he does know he completely failed the mission, Right?
I bet Laftoni Baloni would serve Rigatoni.
This is a great game Scott messed up
Mark has made so much progress in the past few years. He went from refusing to play a tutorial, no matter what, so willing submitting himself to them. I’m proud of him  Edit: Nvm. I made it to 22:01. He hasn’t changed 🤣
can someone help i tryed to download the game from game jolt but it only came as a video trailer
Babudee dabudie
6:14 every software engineers first day of job be like
this game outsold
1:19 Is that Hank J. Wimbleton? Also, I love how he fucking tamed he enemy at the end by sheer accident.
Wow, I never thought Drippy would make it to the FNAF world so quickly!!!
One peeve I have is that Afton is BRITISH AS FUCK canonically but it’s only a little thing
no way they americanized his ass
Do you live in Aberdeen? I saw a billboard of you there about space
I'm not even a FNAF fan, never got into the games and don't have any fond memories growing up with the series (I'm assuming) like alot of others subscribed to this channel. Which is mostly due to life stuff, and being an avid old school survival horror fan caused from growing up with Silent Hill, Fatal Frame and Resident Evil....but this game, had it seen the light of day. Probably would've gotten me interested.  Out of all the FNAF fan games I've been exposed to through content creators, this seems the most original imo. Even the storyboard sections are well planned and thought out. You can get a just of the story simply from still black and white drawings. Which some games struggle to do with a finished product, full story and cinematics. Really says something about what this could've been. Also it's probably just me, but some features in this remind me alot of what would eventually be seen in Security Breach...
Laftonibaloni🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hello mark plz play polar dread
Omg it’s like the glowy holes from soma!
Not mark over here ignoring all the level objectives
This is an interesting game, an immense amount of work has gone into it.
** 😊😊**
When are you going to get a greenscreen??
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttttt
foll lol
im listening to distractible I SWEAR!
*any dog that exists even robot*   Mark to foxy: you are a very cute dog   foxy inside: *happy dog noises* (or fox)
Why does the voice at 10:00 sound like mark?
What did afton do this time ugh ✋😤 them: a f t o n b u i l t  what did he build: them: AFTON BUILT.
11:54 Easter egg Freddy,chica,golden Freddy on the wall.
i'd love to see you do a full playthru on this if it ever comes out
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing/mark 2022
38:43      *That's all i have to say*
that change at the end was so funny. lol From Frustration to Awe :v
I loved that wholesome moment when you started bonding with the Foxy
Laftoni Baloni
My only question is, why on EARTH is Afton so calm after being in that rotten suit for 30 YEARS!!??!?!
Foxy walking on four feet is interesting change
Honestly in my opinion, they're better off without Scott and the game being in the "fanverse". They can turn this into its own game, with its own universe, characters and depth. Work on it, make the game grow into its own and make that sweet moolah.
Wouldn’t be a markiplier let’s play video if he didn’t completely neglect all tutorials
5:20
I love the storyboards so far and the graphics, mechanics, etc. are amazing! But I personally think there's a little too much talking and the voice actor is odd for the part
3:49 this is prime editing right here 😂
Aww he tugged my heart when he mentioned A Goofy Movie. That was one of my favorites and still is!
30:29 “E”
8:55 FLASH BANG OUT!!
Is no one gonna talk about how the monitor has the image of a purply-pink rabbit? It gives me Vanny vibes…
This is great! To be honest I think a good strategy would be to set up cameras at places so that you know where Foxy is at all times or something, then placing a bomb on each bonk station, so you don't have to place the bomb on the thing while you're being chased. Foxy seems to get faster with each time you stun him, so that could incentivize more careful planning. Theres also the fact that what Markiplier is doing is a more risky way to handle the situation, but it takes Foxy several bites to kill Mark. I'd say maybe it'd be scarier if it just one-hit killed like most fnaf games, but then we have Security Breach and it wouldn't be a good idea to make something too unfair. You could even place bombs on the floor and while Foxy is in roam mode activate it. Then there's the lights that may affect Foxy's behavior. Who knows.
immagine if they made the rated R version of fnaf oh wait it kinda already is my mom thinks it’s 4 and up she’s kinda dumb lol
Pls do a Jumpscare Times List 😅
If it was worked on a little longer it could have animations for jumping down or scaling up walls, along with adding impact to the bites
I love this video
that foxy is literally a kleer from serious sam.
maybe it was too much anime for Scott...
Me: (Boots up Afton built) ok this doesn't seem too bad...  also me: NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE (closes and proceeds to uninstall the game) nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope SO much nope. FUCK that
Plz someone maka game called Sir-flubs-a-lot-fun fun fair
The storyboard character looks cool
Mark should do a hello neighbor series tbh. As old as that game is, it'd still be a good series
It's 3:39am and my dad just walked in my room asking why I was awake. Scared the crap out of me.
LAFTONI BALONI'S LAUGHAPALOOZA
Ya know that might not be a bug instead it might've been a feature from preventing that exact situation from happening were you trap in one spot
Straight up thought that was my fire alarm going off
the man behind your daughter
Okay but lixian isnt getting enough credit in these comments for the text edits with the game title. That was legitimately incredibly well done and probably took most of his time on this.
i can't get over the fact that william doesn't have a british accent in this
Peepaw willy got stolen oh noEe
Honestly i appreciate mark encouraging people to make their games their own things, I feel like some of these games sometimes get INCREDIBLY limited by being fan games and could do so much extra if they just branched off from that base franchise and went wild!
I love how Mark is trying SO HARD not to curse and insult the game.  Also, hey, if whoever made this ever makes it into a standalone game they've got the guarantee that Mark will play it. That's cool.  I'd say that Mark would have a much easier time if he reads anything the game tells him, but I saw MatPats playthrough and that was rough too, even when they read what to do soooo....
17:13 markiplier becomes a vocaloid ‼️‼️‼️NOT CLICKBAIT ‼️‼️‼️😱😱😱
Hello everybody my name is Insane
this was 3 years ago or why the hell there are 2 weeks ago comentary
I don't understand why youtubers don't play the tutorials, it only makes them look stupid. If you don't think it will make good content, do it off camera. Hell, the tutorial you did play told you that bombs must be detonated in line-of-sight and you still didn't absorb that, so maybe it's pointless after all. You didn't even try the other tools like the light, which is 50% of the mechanics.
You should play “Graidwind Incident 77” it’s a really scary horror game
Mark I poker you've enlarged half of my life and inspired me with your quotes and different encouraging words its so comforting and amazing you've inspired me so much mark
Markiplier please play The Quarry on PS5. Same creators of Until Dawn!
The codex astartes does not support this action
This kinda makes sense linking how fuckin afton came back in security breach OwO bro this is kinda cool.
RelationSHIP? Much like the ship of Theseus
Hi Mark, I’d love more of this game
the ending got me xD
I seriously hope they continue this game with a different setting and characters to me this is honestly one of the best fnaf's fan game that isn't literally just the first game re-skinned and it annoys me that it got denied because this has so much potential. For someone to make this in their own time without funding just shows how amazing this could be with Polish.
Cant believe he said "I'm blue" and didnt continue singing "Da ba dee da ba di da ba dee da ba di..."
Tutotial: It blows up all bombs _in sight_ Markiplier: *Without Bomb in Sight* "WHY WON'T IT GO OFF!?
3:47 gives me a flashback to that Unus Annus episode of Hip With Phonics and the “Cat with the fat ass sits on a hat!”
also afton robotics has a story line to it so its not a random name
he needed to use fazbear fright because fnaf has a buntch of story line to it so its easy cuz he dont need to make his own story line
Why dose it say 2w ago
So, I'm at 12:29 , and this man is giving off Dave from DSAF vibes, legit.
My dog reacted to the firealarm in the story board
This game has really great music wow
You could call it Mickey's Hickey's
i will be tuning in for the sir flubs-a-lot’s funfair playthrough
Markiplier should play Tyke and Sons Lumber Co. It's the greatest fnaf fan game ever made, it's really well developed.
HELP EVERYTIME THE DOG CHASES MARK I GET SO SCARED THAT I CLENCH MY BUTTCHEEKS TOGETHER 💀💀💀
DANGIT. YOU ACTUALLY FREAKING GOT ME WITH THAT LAST SCARE. HOW DARE YOU
The Fazbear Fanverse has 3 upcoming titles that haven't been cancelled, and are releasing (hopefully) soon. The three are: Five Night's at Candy's 4, Five Nights at Freddy's PLUS, and POPGOES Evergreen. Mark, I plead you to follow the development of these games as they are being made by incredibly talented creators (some of which you've played their previous games) that have been working hard in making their final chapters to the FNAF series. Some pre-release photos and videos show that these games are highly promising, and are worth checking out due to their new mechanics and terrifying visuals. I assure you they won't be as disappointing as Security Breach. Please consider! Thanks.
scot should have accepted  this game! it could be another universe where like, idk, one of Aftons Friend's kids helps Afton out with desroying his lifes work. yeah! but honestly my little gore fan self just loves this!
Joy Of Destruction
My man in the cutscene looking like Hank J. Wimbleton.         That is all.
Ok
I can see why he said no
Okay does anyone want to know my fnaf OC'S reaction to this game? ( There is more then one oc)
ITS BLUE GUY
that melted mask is 100% not drippy
Laftoni Baloni
is this the laftoni of '87?!
I feel like i know this game wait let me check
I would happily watch a playthrough of this full game! Keep your chin up, dev team :)
Is it just me who thinks this game looks better than the pizzaplex?
6.6m
Tbh, this game is a great idea, but from what I see here the game needs a critical overhaul to the gameplay loop. As it is sorely lacking in that department, I see why Scott rejected it. I wouldn't trust such a small team to overhaul such a critical aspect of their game in a timely manner. While also avoiding falling apart, and even finding a way to improve it. The concept, ai, and gameplay need a major change. It's very pretty, but if this was finished it would not be good if they stuck to this gameplay loop, it's unsatisfying, unengaging, and unstressful?  Rejecting this was a good call. People talk this up as if the demo was good, it's graphics look good, the movement needs tweaking but also looks serviceable. That is it.
*doesnt want to shit on a game thats already been extremely shit on*  *repeatedly shares that he wants to criticize it anyway
I understand the logic of making an own game. However, I think what you Mark and most people forget is that when someone makes a fangame, they dedicate everything to the game they love. They did (Afton) build the entire game around the idea of helping Afton and scrapping animatronics. All to pay tribute to the franchise. You can't just change the title and the characters, and boom own game.  Also you have to remember that literally millions of people started making games, art, animations JUST because of FNaF. Of course they can move on with their own stuff and make money with it, but as long as it's fun for them to make fan creations, they should just go with it.
Why is william not british 🤨
I clicked on fnaf section and actuall fnaf was at the bottom! Crazy dude...Crazy.
Missing a lot of polish. But it did seem genuinely scary.
Respectfully would pet.
Omg 😱 jump Mark! 😂 ☠️
"Crushed dreams." Ya uh. These problems your finding are why it got rejected. or more rather it did get approved but because these was not getting fixed it got cut out from it. That and the fact no one had access to the game till recently and the few that could play said even when it worked it was too hard and too luck based.
Laftonibaloni
When a fan game has less bugs and an overall better gameplay experience than your latest official release....yea Security Breach shouldnt have been a thing
mark needs to stop saying "iS tHaT lAfToNi bAloNi" while im drinking water
@LynkPlaysGames you should play this
Laughtoni baloni
Interestingly! I was reading about these guys over on gamejolt and they do indeed plan on releasing their own content in the future, this was made because Scott had initially signed them on but let them go due to the project being seen as to grand and big of a risk (Disappointing but understandable). They are legally unable to use the content they made from this game which is why it remains in it's current state but please do follow Jelatine they seem to have more great things coming :)
I'm watching the intro story board, It'd be great to see that with a full 3d rendered modeling
Mark's willingness to show pure kindness and shower the Foxy robot with the same affection as a real dog after it tried to rip him to utter shreds, proves that Mark's humanity shines above all things.  And his weakness is good boy puppos.
This seems to be incredibly ambitous for just a tech demo concept. Surprised it was tossed aside.
“What is thaaaaaat about What is thiiiiiis about What is thaaaaaaat about What is all thiiiiis about”
15:30 that is literally the roblox taser sound effect
That game kind acted like fnaf 3 because of the date in the game is 2023 same for fnaf 3 time line
My guy always makes me smile :)
Cool!
The real Aftonbuilt was the friends we made on the way.
Yes,.
The reasons it were rejected are kind of sad and disappointing in my honest opinion. Shame it'll never be developed further.
Honestly would be interested in a full game. Disappointing it won't be one...
Description: "Suprisingly well made"
I love that Mark applauds art in every form even when it's not completely finished.
you make my day better all the time :]
I’m blue dabadedabado
33:47 - Mark sounds like a Bantha from Lego Star Wars II
I like how he’s saying that he’ll play people’s fnaf fan games yet he hasn’t played one night at flumty’s 3 yet
I thought those tentacles were from the upside down
Hi
Laftoni baloni
Not me watching this while literally working on an animation lmaooooo
Screw scott for making the developer not being able to finish this amazing game
Famous lines William Afton: I ALWAYS COME BACK Michael Afton: Father it's me...Michael Elizabeth Afton: I know it was an accident... Markiplier: SHABOSHKI SHABOSHKI DAMMIT!!
E
maybe hit shift?
Petition to rename this game *laftoni baloni* who wants in?
17:22
7:04 DA BE DI DA BE DA!!!. i miss that song so much..
Fun Bunn’s Frights (Bunny Animatronic) Laughton Built Laughton Robotics  Easy fix. All rights yours.
I swear, Lixian's editing skills never fail to make me laugh ☠️ "Laftoni Baloni"
So nobody is going to talk about 7:03 when he says "oh, I'm blue." Lixian should have but the I'm blue song afterward. Just in my opinion.
this is literally my favorite fangame. im so upset about what Scott did to them
Honestly I would love to see Mark play Batman
I wanna see laftoni baloni
Wish this would be finished, the concept is interesting.
A.R. PAD. Naw my hungarian ass just goin ÁRPÁD
Me literally 2 minutes in the cutscenes: "I love it"
Sir flubs a lots is Sir meows alot cousin.
7:05 da ba dee da ba daaaaaa
When Ragnarok comes and the Fenris wolf arrives to eat the world, and everyone is running in terror, Mark will probably turn around and run towards it "Whose a good boy?"
I hope Laftoni Baloni gets made into a proper standalone game
Are you the guy from squid game?
the way my mouth dropped when the animatic started holy shit it looks so good
i love laftoni baloni
Am i the only one who thinks the recording dude sounds like mark a little?
At the beginning why was Kansas in the Oklahoma spot
Anyone else lose their shit when Mark said "Laftoni Baloni's Laughapalooza"?
20 tries of calibrating the foxy dog later…
That cool how thay made foxy as junk yard dog
All this talk from Markiplier saying "It didn't have to be FNAF themed" I can only imagine the creator's response being "got your attention didn't it?"
Mark puts me into physical pain whenever he ignores game mechanics or tutorials and then shits on the game
You should play five nights at mickeys
puppy mode foxy is what i needed
Mark:*Just spamming keys*  *After 1 minute of keyboard destroying*  Mark:"What am I doing?"
Spoopy😊😇🥵🥶
Anytime Markiplier posts something FNAF related: *”My time has come”*
👍👍👍👍❤️
Markiemoo's vids are what keep me going! Anybody else?
Can anyone explain why Hank is in this game
ayo a game based on afton?
8:45 i know that power box model
i was just watching it randomly  goofy ahh sound played  ishit my self
9:00
its the fact mark continued scooping foxy for atleast 5 minutes after completing the task
3:48 Lixian how did you manage to edit the letters dang
It's a shame that this game won't ever get finished. Maybe a petition will help? Idk lol. I feel like this could be the absolute best fnaf fan game ever made, and probably even better than the original series. Maybe that's why Scott denied it. God forbid it overtake the main series (as some fnaf fan games do)
The King of Five Nights at Freddy's has been finally outmatched, as he could not defeat the great Foxysaurus.
9:47  "what is this movement?"   *boing*
Im still wondering. when mark is gonna play ONAF 3?
As of typing this, I haven't watched the whole video yet, but Mark is right in that it's a shame that this had to be left unfinished due to issues having FNaF related to it. He's played great similar games like One Night at Flumpty's and Five Nights at Candy's, which of course very similar to and inspired by FNaF. Given people's fascination with this sort of horror, from the experience to the kind of storytelling, there very well could be more of a subgenre of FNaF-likes if people were willing to divorce their ideas from the main FNaF story and send it in their own direction. While the games themselves don't draw me in, trying to read into the lore of FNaF from all the subtle clues hidden throughout is fun, and even the spinoffs have their own intrigue in terms of how they construct their stories.  Heck, FNaF started relatively simple with lots of small pieces of information that was fun to evaluate, only to spin into a complicated web of events as it went on. While none of those FNaF-likes ever got quite that deep, they very well could have if the creators were interested in going wild with their own stories about their own restaurant chains and their murderous animatronics. Here's hoping some of those hopeful developers heed what Mark was saying here and take a FNaF-like experience into it's own rabbit hole of their imagination!
Did.... Did mark just reference the Goofy Movie?.... I havent heard that name in 12 years..
"My hops are nuts." Also 38:41 was a big plot twist
i see
The more I watch this the more I feel mark didnt actually play past the 2nd fnaf game
Two big issues regarding the whole “this game got rejected because Scott is scared after he failed Security Breach”, Security Breach’s glitches weren’t Scott’s fault (n’or the devs), it was on the publisher and Somy And the devs behind this game were toxic post-rejection and started talking about various insane claims they had too.
More fan Five Nights at Freddy's games
Scott probably rejected it because he retired from fnaf
It's hard for me to appreciate this Markiplier. Barging in thinking he's got it, then not being able to play properly, then getting angry, acting smug and mocking the game and the developers while he's got most of the fault. Videos like this are much less enjoyable than the usual ones.
i love you annie
I liked the cartoonish storyboard cutscene
WAS THAT THE BALONI OF '87?!
"Naw I don't wanna do tha tutorial." "Why isn't this working?" Pretty sure I made the IRL equivalent of the Shocked Pikachu face in a sarcastic manner.
Bro u have more views than mr beast
Interesting route trying to make the undead child murderer your guide pal...
Chica just got sooo jealous!! give her loves too she deserves it >:D
I remember u mark i first started watching u in 2014 and stop 2017 and coming back miss watching your videos
Markiplier Lore moment: The voice of the Afton Robotics PAD is Jacob, the same voice as "I mean some SERIOUS honkers" from Try Not To Laugh Challenge #15 ✨
With this being a proof of concept, its pretty good!
markiplier  the king of bootleg
9
This man has no fears like how? 🤔🤔
Told and shown everything, still fails to do the basics.
I love that the music from the initial cutscene is straight from N64's Perfect Dark. Time for another replay.
Who's Drippy?
If you put a camera on the bomb in theory is in Line of sight?     It looks pretty good mabey some changes but the game is pretty all  complete.
The difference between mark and matpat playing is so interesting to me, I love it XD
this reminded me a lot of horizon zero dawn! really impressive stuff, it's a shame it got rejected
yo why my dog in a markiplier video
Mark saying that it's just a demo, but maybe everything would make more sense if the read the damn tutorials which probably highlights the limits on detonator usage. There's a limit to how long him wandering aimlessly trying to work things out is funny to the point it becomes a bit tiresome, especially when he gets frustrated with not knowing what to do while willingly ignoring tutorial and control screens :S
I bet Markiplier could talk to Scott about this. Scott was too harsh. He shouldn't have rejected such a good game. This game was perfect! It wasn't all generic like most. Kinda makes me SUS of what Scott wants. Doesn't make him look good to destroy someone's dreams when they poured their heart and soul into the game just to be rejected.
First thought when selecting this video is "Let's watch Mark have a nightmare while playing a game! Joy for everyone!"
Sir flubs a lot  I’m on flub lol
Your blue da ba dee da ba die
Eat your heart out security breach
That Foxy... Is basically my foxy LOL i love him
If this is really a five nights at Freddy's game iam very disappointed
Laftoni Baloni made me laugh so hard and uncontrollably, that should have been illegal
Please some one use this out of context 😂 30:14
There's something I like about Markiplier, unlike many other YouTubers he actually plays the game and doesn't make a million cuts to entertain small attention span. It's like watching a live stream but better
I can see this taking place in like a sci fi filth universe. Like there’s rabid robots going around, and a few humans are brave enough to fight against them, something like that?
fml the ending got me real good lmao
I can see why this game was rejected. It certainly doesn’t fit into the series.
This is the good ending to security breach.
It's starting to tell a bit when Mark is not in the mood to make video. You can tell by how easily he dismisses any tutorials and takes no time to try out a mechanic. Whereas in some other even more complex games he patiently tries stuff out, and plays with the game. Hope he is not wearing himself out just to make videos.
I liked laugh Tony Bologna as a kid but he's just not cool anymore
Whoever made this game is probably so excited that the what you could consider kind of fnaf is playing their game and for that i must say thank you mark. Your one of my fav youtubers because you dont need to play famous games for money. You play for fun
This game is so interesting I hope to see more of this
please make another episode
Mark speaking to Foxy like the sweetest poochie is on earth is definitely proving that this man loves dogs to death literally
MARKIPLIER!!!! I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
why is no one talking about laftoni’s laughapalooza😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
If I were to guess, I’d wager this isn’t a part of the official fanon universe because it disrupts canon, as opposed to just adding on to fanon.
It’s okay to accept the fact that the game has some jank, because it’s simply unfinished. No incomplete game will have all of its gameplay tested and ironed out. Despite the jank it has. This game has so much promise. I hope the devs can find a way to keep working on it
This game has a whole lot of potential
5 mins in and already the funniest video i have seen by him, this is now my favorite one. he is so silly and fun i love him so much <3 :D
The game feels like outlast which is  great
Nice information 🙂🙂🙂
oooo a quadruped guard dog animatronic! I made an OC just like it years and years ago! So cool to see the idea in-game.
I would’ve preferred this so much more to Security Breach
NGL, that was one of the best ending jump scares Ive seen from one of Mark's videos
Shoutout to the homie Laftoni Baloni
Mark always makes me smile, making us laugh and all! Also him treating junkyard foxy like his own dog, that was wholesome.  Edit: the ending was a good ending for sure! This was beautiful!
was that the bite of 2022?
Mark is correct at the beginning of the video, I'm creating my own horror game right now. It's called through the lens and it takes place in a hotel and is inspired by the fnaf cameras. It's about intimate objects that are not scary coming to life and becoming scary, for instance, a tomato or a toaster or a rocking chair. It'll be on steam in 6 months or less and for free.
I think I'm not the only one to say this but I think the game didn't come out because of the lore of fnaf that Scott built and he didn't want to make one his characters of the type of person to help other or done what's going in this game also this would make fnaf sister's location ending of spring trap getting out of the fire from frazbear frights.
The god of anamtronic games has made his return💯
8:54 its the upside-down coming to ower world
0:11 I put my head down and then that happened
9:17 no cap he sounds like brimstone
7:05 Da ba dee, da ba dae
scott was just heated that the team he basically enslaved to make this game came out with a better product than a mainline fnaf.
7:04 dabadee dabadaa
👍
this is so good
lol
What Scott did to the devs is unforgivable
3:46 Man, you need to give Lixian a raise.
This is very amazing work video and is you.....
*Mark skips tutorial* Yeah, I think I'll just save myself the time and stop watching now.
39:20 _"You were just hungry weren't you!"_  earlier... *GET'CHO FUCKIN' DOG BITCH!!!* it don't bite *YES IT DO!*
Idk am I missing something? This junkyard area seems kinda buggy would he have been able to avoid these issues if he read the tutorial?
No matter what he always makes anything scary into the complete opposite
i see why it was rejected, it doesn't fit into fnaf, it's a really good game tho and mark is right, make the changes and it can be a stand-alone game
Him being hooked up to a computer makes a lot a sense for glitchtrap being a thing. (that's a for real real thing, right?). I like this a lot!! Cool story!!😎👍
i do like the concept and it does seem to fit with the FNAF world at large. Hitting the keys a number of times and the time seem to be done to literally make the demo impossible but the only thing i can see Scott Coffin doing is making this a thing for "underground" because somehow in this universe the "old diner" is literally just built on top of and they want the animatronics to "seem" safe so they would literally bury the corrupted and/or old models. Because some how putting enough weight on an animatronic disables it just as well as cutting off it's power, which is NEVER explained.
Watching this in the dark and got flash banged at 8:57
12:22 it was at this point that I knew what this was about. Helping Afton achieve control and power through studies of the very thing that left him trapped in that suit.
17:28 Apparently Illinois is Indiana and Louisiana is Mississippi, now.
i love how mark keeps smooching drippy
Dis gaem iz dum... - I mean, definitely made by a FNaF-fan. Huehuehue!...
DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUDGET?!
I really love the fact that Mark is trying to find a way to let the creator make this game happen. It shows how much he cares about the developers and the amazing ideas they have. I hope Mark's words gave the creator some inspiration to continue this game, and any others.
The concept of the game is really great, kinda made me wanna make fanart lol.
He just been nice but still hurts 🤣🤣🤣🥹
Drippy=god
The fact that my name is Toni is great lol
My face at the jump scare at the very beginning of the vid : 😐
WAS THAT THE CRUNCH OF '92?!
*you can call it umm... SCOTTS TOTS* He said in the video with my name being Scott, im not Scott cawthon but just a guy named Scott
bro you kept criticising it like it wasn’t working properly but it was because you didn’t play the tutorial
10:40 why does this guy sound like markiplier...
Youtube on pc: Markiplier uploaded a new video 12 seconds ago!  Me who watched the video five days ago: -.-
I am only about 20 minutes into this but I am going to say this is hands down one of the coolest concepts for a fan game I have ever seen. This is so cool.
im lowkey really hoping that the reason this didn't make it into the fanverse was because scott wanted it to be in direct cannon
.... The King of FNaF? 🤨
So the project was turned away because Scott thought it was too ambitious for a smaller team. He didn't want to find it. But consider this, what if Mark funded it?  Edit: thank you all for being respectful in the replies honestly,  but I have already been informed there are things that make this impossible.  Thank your for trying to shed some light but I've been told plenty of times at this point 😅
Idk anythin of the FNAF story line so. , Is this like story dlc that the creators didnt put it the recent game?
Of all the things I was expecting from a FNaF themed game, a fleshed-out movement system was NOT in the list
Man this game was really good! I would like to see more games pumped out like this! Laftoni baloni is a game that will go down in  history with triple a titles such as elden ring!
I want LAFTONI BALONI now
Markipliers subtle promoting is so impressive
*Aids*
Hey Markiplier can you try to play the game called The last of us part 2. I know you played the first part so can u.
I love how it's called "Afton Built" which relates to FNaF a lot bc of Mr. Afton. This game seems really interesting and FNaF fans like Mark would be intrigued to play it. When I saw the title, I thought it meant this... things that Mr. Afton made. I'm excited to watch this!
Laughing my ass off at ‘Laftoni Baloni’
0:46 yes there is a lot of that revolves on animatronics and some that don’t That do: Five nights at candys  The joy of creation  That don’t  One night at flumptys  Treuset island
“Laftoni Baloni”
SO basically you can make your own animatronics and sell them? NFT Lore
William as mangle type foxy but with a exposed endo edit: I have no idea why but I can find this game
I “watched” this and fell asleep but don’t remember any of it so here I am watching it again. I don’t know how the hell I fall asleep to this sh1t. 🫥
38:52 the way he started petting foxy is so adorable plss
Dam the map rlly said fuck idaho and Washington 4:26
I remember when i was 6 i watched markiplier when he played fnaf 1 he would always be happy and screaming in his intros,but now he’s calm and chill
Niiiiiiice
Man I hope they repurpose this game because it’s really unique
I'm turkhis
love the wreck it ralph reference😭
7:05 DA BA DI DA BA DI
I can only thing of how hard it must've been for lixian to edit the title part omg Not as in too hard for him way In a "omg he's so talented way"
Laftoni Balonis Laughapalooza
*LAFTONI BALONI*
someone please make a game named laftoni baloni's laugha palooza
34:42 the green light just barely out of sight the moment mark pressing the button
Hey Mark, could you play porkchop's horror show? It's a really good fnaf kinda game, made by phisnom, who's currently working on fnaf plus!
I think it would be cool if mark attempted to make a game. especially if it were fnaf lol
with a bit of polish and bug fixes this probly could've been better than Security breach.
Mark should really play some more FNAF fan games, I enjoyed watching him play final nights 4, jolly 3 chapter 1 and 2 and the five nights at Candy's series
Me at 3am watching this screaming out loud: "YOU CAN METROID SCAN THE ANIMATROMBOS" someone send help
This game is fucking boring.
watchdogs 2 meets fnaf.
17:26
To be a bit optimistic about this wonderful concept: Perhaps if the creators grow their dev team they might get another shot.  After all they've gotten a lot of exposure at this point. Perhaps they could use it to bring more people in.  Well, one can hope, because I'm already super interested in the story now. Would be a pity if it can't be developed further.
Riding round in my peterbilt yessirrr
Mark, every video: "Lixian make this funny" Lixian, carrying this channel on his back: "You got it boss"
i reccomend Twins as a great fnaf fangame, worth a vid
7:05 Hmm... Da ba dee da buh dai, as they say.
Pls play I'm on observation duty 5
9th time asking for chapter 2 of sucker for love~ :°
ok but why was it actually rejected because this would be an awesome finished project
better than security breach ngl
It's a shame the game was dumped after being strung along for two years just because an untested cash grab crashed and burned. Maybe the devs just forgot to make it marketable to children and adding blatant furry bait, accidentally making a horror game and that's what threw scott off of liking it.
Sheesh
They didn’t need to flash bang me br like this isn’t cod bro 8:56
Laftoni Baloni, are you on drugs???
There’s a new one night at flumptys game and I was wondering if you could play the hard boiled mode
Yes that was a jump scare when you did that my heart almost died
Tbh, the foxy on the thumbnail looks more cool than scary.
Please make it a full game even if it mean to turn around and change name and "design" so it"s not related to fnaf anymore!
Man bro I love your videos
4:03 this sounds like mark trying to say the name of a weird italian pasta
I love sir flubs a lot's funfair
6:50 was that the bite of 87
I was in deep pain watching him struggle to realize that you have to been in line of sight of the explosive to detonate the explosive.
The jumpscare at the end caught me so off guard.
scott was jealous that this guy made a better game then him
did you watch Theft King's video and then decide to play it?
WOOOOOOOO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S ALL WE WANTED WOOOOO
i love Mark and all and we all know the game is glitchy because it’s a demo, but i can’t help but get a bit frustrated at the way he’s rubbing the “crushed dreams” thing in our faces 😭 i see he’s trying not to be insensitive but it’s just coming across as the opposite
Mark: I'm blue  Me: Danba de daba da
Has more polish than Security Breach on PS4, but somehow isn’t good enough to be a fan game according to Scott. But SB is good enough to be official.
Strange how the description contradicts Mark’s experience playing the game…😂
basically he was stealling animatronic.
Based on what the devs and leaked information about, how scott Cawthoon acted during the Afton Build. Scott C was being horrid, did not act like a propper buisnessman, he ignored messages for weeks on end, did not fun the game when he said he would , and honestly . I lost respect for him . After, all recent documents came out against him .    The devs worked hard and Scott C. Was a dush in the highest degree.
Wow. Mark truly is the king of FNAF
I wonder what timeline of the fnaf franchise this game is based on 🤔 anyway I'm really happy to see mark playing fnaf fan games again! 👍
This game wouldn’t have been rejected if it was named Laftoni Baloni
W ending
1:31 DO YOU THINK I HAVE THE PATIENCE TO DEAL WITH YOUR SHIT GET OUT OF MY WAY
Can we talk about the map and how it has Indiana stamped in Chicago.
That jump scare actually got me
Gonna be honest, despite the roughness and the dickery that Mark went through, this is not a bad looking or bad playing game.  If it ever becomes a thing, imma try it for sure :P
:( I didn’t get a notification for this video! Glad I saw it! ❤️
I heard a creatures reference. Wow. So much joy.
Am I the only one who is the most of the video just looking at him because he is so pretty, handsome and just beautiful 😔- No? Okay nice
”Laftoni baloni” I just couldnt keep my laughter in after that
11:02
This game looks just as good as Security Breach tbh
Top tier editing as always Lixian
William Afton!! From the FNAF books! Sweeeeet
Theres more to just messing with foxy, you had to enter the control room, close all vents in sewer, then extract from bonnies body uptop
the “Laftoni Baloni” 😭😭
I love how this game sets this in the US when it was really in Britain 💀💀💀💀
Thanks to Mark, I've been immune to jumpscares in his videos.
it was a mistake from Scott to cancel the support of this game...it has a lot of potential, honestly.
Game: _you have multiple objectives_ Mark: _ok how about I do just 1 objective but a million times_
Wasnt this the game that Scott was on board for and then didnt respond to any of their questions until a year or so later, to then cut them off out of nowhere for little reason other than it doesnt meet Scotts insane standards of an ambitious project? Which left them in shambles and had to scrap the project?
Mark one moment: ***Running away from killer dog-like animatronic trying to KILL him*** Mark the next moment: "HAY POOCHIE!" *Running towards killer dog thing*
Me: *Sees this video, and sees it has the word "Afton" in the name* Also me: Well this can only go down hill from here-
It needed to be fazbears fright because he needed springtrap
Markipiler, the best let’s player :)
While I agree on the franchise being non-essential. I'll be honest, I'm not looking at a game called 'Laughtoni Bologna' and thinking, "I wanna play that". Peeps saw the success of Freddy Fazbear's and it made more sense to hook up to it.
Laftoni Baloni - A clown named Toni with laughing balloons. Boom, game idea.
Let's be real you can't blame the mechanics if you don't fully know how they're supposed to work in the first place
battlepass
At this point, I just know when hes gonna edit in a jumpscare
As soon as I saw aftonbuilt as the title of the video I heard the ghost of Matpat whispering “the lore” in my ear. Help.
Laftoni Baloni
Afton smell hashish Again
The game seems really cool, the sfx are solid and the visuals & animations are really sleek and fit the atmosphere perfectly. The only thing I'd personally prefer is if the detonation/trap mechanic were part of a stealth aspect of the game, where you can use the line of sight and trap/button positioning to ambush/lead enemies around and manipulate them to their deaths (or stuns, like in the video), and if there was something else for the action and direct confrontation. It felt weird to have such an indirect method of head-on fighting, almost kind of awkward. I just think the awesome speed and mad hops you have should be coupled with some cool action abilities, and maybe the traps and devices could help foster a stealthier side of the game (especially in spookier, closer-quartered settings), but that's just me and I hope they find success with however they decide to move forward with the game. Their dreams may have been crushed, but hopefully new ones can grow to replace them, because there's a lot of potential for a complete game here and they deserve recognition for their hard work.  P.S. - While they have very interesting domestication techniques, the poochie was very cute, 10/10 best demo :)
i think markiplier is bored of playing these clones lol
ive spent an upsetting amount of time fawning over the mechanic (protagonist)
40:22 foxy became so livid lol
7:05 Da Ba Dee Da Ba Die
There is a Mickey’s Pizza in my town. New York style pizza
sleepsleepmoon
I love Lixian's translations/subtitles of Mark.
i wish the devs put some life back into this game, it has so much potential in it, but it hasn’t been fully harnessed yet. if this game was finished, then hoo boi would it be good
WHOAAA
The speed and damage of the dog actually makes this game seem enjoyable. Having an enemy run faster than you is always such a terror in games like this.
mark being possessed by EEF for a sec-
38:44  Me @ the feral ass dog my mom tells me not to go near
Still better than Security Breach
Aftons new name is Laughtoni Baloni
I really hope we see more of this game in the future and that the developer doesn't abandon it! I think it's SUCH a cool concept and we have been WAY overdue for a thing from William's perspective, even if it is just a fan game! This is actually a wonderful representation of his character so far and I find it so fascinating to see other people FINALLY approaching things from this point of view (normally it's just me busting out essays and analysis of William Afton as a character) and it's honestly so heartbreaking to learn this game was rejected. It was SUCH a good premise and set us up for SO many things the canon fnaf games never gave us. Not to mention the design for Junkyard Foxy is just stellar and SO like William to create! Obviously it's still finicky and needs some touching up before it can be played comfortably, and I certainly don't want Mark to have to play through this demo frustrated the whole time, but I'd live to see it updated and maybe then another try from Mark? Either way I'm going to be thinking about this game a LOT now, it makes me so excited!!
Basing the game off the fazbear story comes with its benefits.  The player immediately knows what world they're in and how other games like it might relate to this one. Like, the whole groundwork has already been laid out, and they can build on it.  It's a lot easier than making a story from scratch.
50th on trending
26:58 "Come here you" sounds straight like that guy in family guy with the wheelchair
It's very visually pleasing, definitely a good idea and would love to see a full version. It has potential as a separate game from fnaf, with different models for the interactive objects (like the scooper) to further separate the theme.
So fun fact... He could easily have beat the last level. He just never looked at the objectives to see if he finished getting the parts from the fox, which he got twice over on that last attempt.
"What. The. Hell. Is. Growing. On. That."  I immediately had PTSD of Resident Evil 7
This is an incredible concept, I really hope that this game gets picked up again.
why was this games cutscenes still better than the Fnaf security breach endings
Laftoni Baloni!  I died 💀😂
I'm pretty sure Mark got all of the things he needed from the quicktime events but just didn't realize it.
this rendition of Foxy is terrifying tho I would love to see it used as an original horror game tbh
Mark: "MAKE ME FUNNY!" Lixian apparently: "Otamatone it is."
Please do part 2 i love this game it is very cool
I love you, Markiplier.
6:10 to be continued later
Does it pain anyone else watching mark play this? Like mark i love you but please XD if need be i can list all exhibits in this video of where marks gaming skills go poopy brrrrr
Im so ready for the animations xD
I love how the rat in the storyboard says “sneef”
This game is fucking amazing just the controls need a little more work
Awesome
mark: smooches and says he's a good boy to foxy. Chica: He's cheating on me :(
This is the most bored ive been watching a gaming video.
I also need to bring Dustin home with me.  He's my security blanket.
I'm in your house; licking your kitchen counter.  Feed me.
I kinda want to create the Horrorgame Mark described now........surviving in Sir Flubs-A-Lot's Funfair.....while the entire buiding is burning down...and something with Laftoni Baloni.....sounds great
Did I tell you there was a fight club here? It sucked some ass let me tell you what.  It's done now. :(  No more joy for me.
Mark; feed me!!!!! (also ask grandpa if he has like; my social security card or like my driver's liscence. Vivian's gotten my name changed to Bethany Lynn (it's C*NT in chinese) Crane; and got rid of all my middle names.)
I'm at the homeless shelter The Springs Rescue Mission "with Vivian" BUT MOSTLY WITH A DUDE NAMED DUSTIN BECAUSE HE'S HOT. Too bad I'm ACE; I would cannibalize him.
I'm over the anorexia thing; I'm just not going to recover from that and I still want to eat ice cream and like; bananas. Can you tell Alex that I'm dumb; blind and alone? I lost my glasses.
Mark, this is your cousin g.g.; you need to feed me.
With no spoilers is space connected to heist bc I haven’t seen either 👀
Its been a looong time mark... a very long time. well 6 months
Y’all is it legal to have a Kickstarter to finish the game cause I would pay big moneys for it to get made
He built different tho
Vocaloid Markiplier isn't real, he can't hurt you  Vocaloid Markiplier: 17:10
I see that Mark unlocked the happy ending of the game.
That was an annoying game.
12:53 ok, ok, it’s not thaaaaat hot in Arizona unless you’re straight out in the desert. Trust me…
Mans got hops
The intro cutscenes in this game were better then the ending cutscenes in Security Breach
The alarm in the intro 'cutscene' sounds exactly like my smoke detectors. I RAN out of my room to check and when I took off my headset I knew it was from the game. Damn, that is the true scare.
Fun fact: "Scott's tots" is an episode from the office (season 6). Dunno how I remembered but when Mark said it it sprung in my mind somehow.
What an amazing demo, shame that it didn't manifest into a full game
u really dont know what this game is about
Honestly, those placeholder storyboard cutscenes are pretty cool
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
I love how mark doesn't know that you need to be near a remote control bomb to activate it.
The phone guy sounds like that one robot from that one game you played. It was like we crashed on earth as a robot and the person inside the robot was unresponsive, it sounded like the one dude who gave himself his own personality. I don't remember the game name
17:02 Hatsune Mark sounds so good, when is the concert?
for real
Mark: Say bye poo- Me irl: Holy sht jesus christ fuck, you finally got me
Laf-Toni Baloni isn't a bad name actually
This art style is sick. I really hope they make it a full game.
Seriously mark needs to play god of war ragnarok when it comes out
WAS THAT THE BOLOGNA OF LAFTONI BOLONI
Laftoni Baloni
The valves in the sewer was  to get the water in and to electrocute the foxy
*doesn't see the tutorial even though the game tells you to*  *dies 4 times within the next location not knowing it needs line of sight to activate the bomb*
80 percent of his failures is because his mistakes not the game. multiple times where you was trying to blow up the IED your sight to it was being blocked.
"Laftoni Baloni" might be perfect name for fine dish
Mark in the story board the building said Fazbear frights
Too scary😭
hey mark, you should try out project readjusted 3
LAUGHTONI BALLONI
Markiplier slowly going insane.
Hee hee mark fnaf fun
Mark: *is confused* Also Mark: *doesn't do the tutorial*
0:09 Lixon got me good not gonna lie
They should actually add a foxy dog pet to this game that whould be so adorable just having a foxy pup following you around
As someone who lives in az I can  Confirm this
34:30 didn't mess it up, you just already removed tamper locks
Ngl, at 30:15 when you started repeated shoveling that doggo, laughter was uncontrollable
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87?!?!
The fact that he didnt know about the flood lights that stun foxy makes this so much more impressive and funny
"What was it doing not blowing that up" lol, the tutorial you already did showed you placing it on a button just.....presses the button
Would have been a great game if approved and was probably still under development and gave up on it when it was disapproved
I do hope, now that they're out of the running for the fnaf creator collab, that they do just cut their losses with Scott and find a way to bring this to life as their own game property. It's still very rough as it is now, but there's a lot of unique gameplay potential here. They just need to take the fnaf paint off of it and remodel it as an original story. I think they could manage it. They just need funding.
this game would have been ASTRONOMICALLY better than that monstrosity we got instead
7:02  Cue Eiffel 65 - Blue
38:20 i better see some Markiplier animation of this part i swear it'll be adorable
Long time no see buddy
the cracking sound Lixian threw in when Mark crouched had me loling
I like how he literally explains it has to be in line of sight and he kept going just out of it 😂
i would like to play the full version of laftóní balóní
Now that Markiplier played this. Hopefully this can get some more traction and become a full game. Here's hoping.
SIR FLUBSALOT FUN FAIR
Gosh; this game got rejected and we got **Nightmare 90s** instead?
laugh tony baloney 😂
mark "i dont know what im supposed to be doing"  tutorial and task list "Am I a joke to you?"
you know afton says people shouldnt have access to the robot chasis but for a almost 40 year old robot animatronic with which i guess 100s still in use how could people not get their hands on these
I truly love how Mark is like," Hey, you don't have to only make fan games. Make your own game. It'll be amazing! I'll play it." I understand people making fan games, and many fan games are amazing and well made. I love how Mark tells people to be their best selves in the nicest way possible.
Just gotta remember that the controls are the way they are because it's not fleshed out- If they had gone all the way through with it, maybe things would be smoother thanks to play testing and such.
Thank you Lixian for your editing comedy <3
I hope someone was writing all those game names down
I call my pet rabbit flubs
After Mark kissing foxy... All I can think of is " *Yiff the fox* "
Man why did this NOT get accepted? It's such an interesting concept! Having Afton be resurrected into a tablet is bonkers in all the right ways!! The voice acting was really decent too. And of course the game looks fantastic.
39:05 I'm drawing that
20:00 Never in my life i expected to see a bag of sabrositos in a game like this.
Mo pasmopobia
The animated eyes on the tablet remind me of Wheatley in Portal 2
Got a ad right at 10:34 so I heard “hello, hello?” “NERDS” and I was super confused until the rest of the ad played
I wish he did the tutorial omg pleaseeeeee
This realeased on my b-day thx mark
The graphics are super nice 👍🙂
concept: the MC just had someone close to him die, that could be motive for working with afton.   The final boss could even be a reanimated animatronic vers of their loved one that they end up having to fight
This game does have an interesting premise and as Mark said if they rework it into their own story using their own characters it might do alright after a lot more work and polish but it seems like they bit off more than they could chew with this one, trying to make a big game costs a lot of money and understandably Scott wasn't willing to invest in something that could take several years and a ton of money to make just to have it not do well when there are hundreds of other projects he could support on a much smaller scale for the same amount of money he would have gave to these developers.
The LAST jump scare got me, the last freaking one smh
Do a revisit on welcome to the game 2
Character: *nods*  Markiplier: NO WAY ITS LIKE IN SPACE WITH MARKIPLIER
It would be cool to check out Hawaii and Alaska
I am now expecting someone to make a "Sir Flubs-a-lot's Fun Fair" horror game
The ending scared tf out of me lmaooo
Wait what happend and why did Scott crush their fallen dreams
Man that intro cutscene had me reeled in so quickly 😭
Slightly unpopular opinion, but there’s no need for the developers to change it into “their own thing” They like the FNAF universe and the concept of remanent and William Afton. It makes this game super cool and the lore put into it is so impressive!!
What's the name of the guy talking on the radio thing
The jump scare at the end was genuinely well done
7:23 Chica Head!
He's a good poochy if you don't Sign a light on him
Ok but this is a really cool concept. The whole game of Afton Built looks incredible and I hope it doesn’t stay a demo for long.
My daughter just drew me a picture of Wes  Knifey who has knife hands. It was real cute
Wat is dis????
I can imagine a Markiplier animation that has him telling foxy that he's a good boy while there's chunks missing from his butt and side XD
aftonbuilt is S+ tier  security breach is B at best
for an unfinished demo it's pretty good tho and I honestly love the story board "cutscenes", it'd look pretty nice as an aesthetic with some polish and care
If you value human life please don’t support abortion. 1 million poor babies a year are killed in the womb with 98% of them being out of pure convenience (aka not wanting to take responsible for their baby so they decide to have it killed). For every baby up for adoption there’s over 20 families willing to adopt. There’s no reason this genocide needs to continue. With the progression of science and fetal development outside the womb it’s only a matter of time before abortion will be regarded as a grave evil. Be on the right side of history. Choose life.
LAFTONIE BALONIE?!?!
This game reminds me a lot of Dishonored, with it's climbing and leaning, zooming in with a spyglass like overlay and environmental takedowns.
17:20 well he made it funny right there
ngl this reminds me of tjoc
Mark: “I’m blue”  Me: da ba de da ba da
38:50 At last, the friendly Foxy theory has come true!
“Sir Flubs-A-Lot”? 🤔 like as “Sir Poops-A-Lot” which kinda looks like a bear with a top hat, similar to freddy?
7:05 da ba Dee da ba die da ba Dee da ba die
Play this more
7:03 da ba dee daba da-ee? xD
From what I heard when I looked into the story of Aftonbuilt Scott was a bit of an asshole and it's all his fault we don't have this awesome game. I really hope the devs make this game but as their own IP because this kind of talent really deserves to be seen and experienced by the world.
About time this game got recognition.
I'd totally play Laftoni Baloni's Laughapalooza
I love that Afton is stuck in a hand unit and is looking at the player with the little eyes
Please play pubg again
whoever did those storyboards is amazing, that art makes my brain so happy
Stop trying to be relevant. It’s over. Do somthing else
I really like the concept of this! I think this could still turn out as an amazing game ✨
Yknow mark its not shitting on crushed dreams if you give the developer constructive criticism its kinda what demos are for no? Id prefer being told how I could approve on something im working on as long as its done in a caring and respectful way
38:49 yt women be like
2:40 giving rust players oil rig ptsd
The amount of effort put into the Laftoni Baloni is immaculate, thank you Lixian
day 8 of asking mark to continue yandere simulator
Mark: Sir Flubs-a-lot's Funfair! YT fans: Meme that now, MEME THAT NOW!
The Doctor: Mark! You Are Sensitized From Playing These Horror Games
Mark taming foxy. we need this.
(sigh) ...finally a game where we get to play with Foxy without others trying to steal the limelight and it never got approved.
funny to see mark lose his ish at a demo of what isn't even a rage game :P in all seriousness, mark does seem to find a lot of unintentional bugs in games, i think it's good for developers to see what their own playtests may have missed or what they weren't able to iron out and finalize.
just got done recording this for my channel and i wanted to see someone elses reaction to it and im very glad i wasnt the only one frustrated by the controls and bugs, its an amazing demo, i mean its not even a demo but just a proof of concept, so for what it is its really really good concept, but man i wish we could have a version with all these bugs patched and maybe some better designed controls but i understand why the devs of this game want to just move on and not continue working on something that was rejected by scott himself
this game gives me portal vibes for some reason
I'm at home with COVID unfortunately and 3:47 is probably the funniest thing I've seen while quarantining. Thanks Mark <3
Mark's gotta replay this game for the other objectives. I woulda liked to see the rest of the game.
3:39 can’t wait to see Mark play that in the future when someone watching inevitably makes it real
Amazing concepts and for a demo and fan build looks like great mechanics for what it is just needs the support to get it that cleanness
Just by the name, a game like this is always terrifying.
Mark when he was struggling: CRUSHED DREAMS  Mark when dog: I love this game what a good game
I full on gasped when I saw the notification for this video
The game was rejected for being "too much of a risk," I assume financially, since by how it appears this could've been a project comparable to the scale of Security Breach. Though honestly, I'd rather have this  Keep in mind even though this is developed by fans, this would have been an official FNaF project with an official release, as with the rest of the Fanverse. This demo was made for Scott Cawthon to play, to approve or reject the project. I'm so sad it was rejected though
Lixian is best girl
ah yes, the blue unreal engine advanced locomotion Michelin man 😂😂
that's a solid representation of my dog when he is hungry, and also me honestly, HAHAHA
Please
If you continue this franchise game thing can you make it a bit brighter
very happy this project got some recognition. A lot of work and love has gone into this project. I feel like scott made a mistake by turning this project away.
Someone please make a sir flubbsalot game
if this is in america...why the steerin wheel on the right in the story board?
If you complain there's bugs, you probably don't know what you're doing or you're just bad.
Laftoni baloni
If only there was proper funding i wonder how amazing this could have turned into. Could have had a crowd funding but no that would be a breach of contract 🙄
I don't know why someone in their right mind would ever reject this game (Then again, Scott isn't exactly the kind of person to be thinking all that correctly given his political choices). It looks incredible and could've been so amazing. The devs should create a kickstarter. I imagine it would do insanely well given the positive reception it's been recieving.
7:04 Mark- o h, I'm *blue* Me- DA BA DEE DAB BA DIII DA BE DEEE
When mark doesn’t use any info he gained from the tutorial about checking the animatronic for its safety latches
You looked so happy while watching the outscene
It’s no longer just five nights, A.F.T.O.N is actually an anagram for “A Fuck Ton Of Nights”
27:27 Markiplier crying out like that cracked me up so bad.
this week on: mark doesn’t read the instructions
I wasn't expecting that last jumpscare
not mark switching the name around 500000 times😭
He quoted Wreck It Ralph and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
Why is Foxy looking like that?
If someone doesn't make Laftoni Baloni's Laugh-A-Palooza into an actual horror game we riot
if i understand correctly, i think it was rejected because it was too ambitious
the map said that louisiana is mississippi
I wish that this game could be finished, I'd love to see it in full
MORE FNAF MORE FNAF LETS GO
Very confused as why Mark refers to this as a demo of crushed dreams... What happened to the developer(s)?
I would've loved to go to Sir Flubs-A-Lot's Fun Fair. Too bad it's burned down.
Cool to see Mark playing FNAF again. Really hyped me up since the REVISITED series.
22:42 I get the reference but the right term is never hit a man with glasses

The concept of this game is brilliant
39:05 - Given what we've learned about Mark though his Pokémon Smash or Pass recently, I'm now genuinely concerned that Mark might yiff the fox.
I feel personally attacked xD What if I don’t want to laf?!
Hot shit I just watched him play it and it should DEFINITELY be developed into its own thing.
So....the game is broken and not fixed huh?
"laftoni baloni"  me: amogus
its a pity It wont be complete , its great
The walking animation for Foxy Dog is so nice
Speaking of the Freddy Fazbear’s Fanverse. Mark, Why did you still NOT play ONaF 3?  I am gonna comment everyday until you play it!
Mark: maybe I should do the tutorial, nah I’ll be fine.  Everyone watching: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?!
I wanna see a this continued
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Mark Pls Play Ghostwire Toyko
Hey mark can you do one night at flumpty’s 3
Mark: "I would never shit on some one's crushed dreams!" mean while Wade: "Frick your hopes, Frick your Dreams"
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
Foxy turned into a monster
7:05 da ba de da ba dai
My channel growth is crazy
Mark, this is why we, say it with me now, DO. THE. TUTORIAL.
Lol he’s still using the fnaf 2 office
i enjoy this
"it's a demo of crushed dream's !! it's just a demo of crushed dream's !!" -Markiplier 2022
i think he watched that one video about this game.
I feel that if there is a full game, this will be the new welcome to the game 2 moment
They should have finished the aftonbuilt game
Why is this a more polished version of security breach
34:41 The scooper arm blocked it.
19 watching the mark series makes me laugh cause man is trying to hide his disappointment hella
play guardian tales
Mark
35:05
It’s crazy because my nick name is tony baloney
Markiplier, Are you gonna play One Night At Flumpty's 3?? It has been released for a long time and i've been waiting. Hope you play it
"There is no more jump" Sounds familiar
sub
I like how Mark skipped the tutorial and taunts to that horrifying wandering animatronic like an innocent puppy then screams at the screen and losing his mind after the failed attempts and bugs he's facing 😂
Is!!!!!
Wow
I see working with Arin "skip the tutorial then get mad when you don't know how to do something that is explained in the tutorial" Hanson has rubbed off on you
Fnaf???
Glad you're giving this game some attention and support. Screw Scott for leading the team on.
He disarrange the title for no reason Xd
It is genuinely upsetting that this won't be a finished game, the concept is so cool, the models are amazing and the CHARACTERS have so much CHARACTER! It really is a shame
p l e a s e if the creators if this make a full game i would 100% buy and play it
Happy weekend to everyone 😎
I think this is the only time you play as the bad guy? The other games, you're a security guard or maintenance, although the boy in security breach... Or maybe this is the only time you play the good guy?
I just love any fnaf related thing that markiplier plays, his comments on ANY video are what I just love to listen to.
Who or what is "drippy"?
Wow
Did anyone ever notice that Mississippi was in Louisiana on the map
28:28 "It's a demo of crushed dreams! It's a demo of crushed dreams!"  Anyone just love seeing Markiplier lose his mind like this?
Random detail I noticed: The opening scene implies that this takes place in England (of another country that has left-hand driving) because the steering wheel in the van is on the right.
This games environment reminds me of tarkov
beautiful

I think the reason why this was turned down is because it's not entirely cannon to the lore...? Don't count me on that, but the sheer thought of Afton being nice or even remotely cordial at all is..... off... he was a pedocidal maniac after all... not that there's anything wrong vwity maniacs... ahem 😅
I read it as Aftonbutt
can you PLEASE play omori!!!!!! <33
This is a fnaf fa game markiplier
mark: freely roaming around the animatronics Me: OHMYGOD HOW IS HE NOT SCARED  Timbers=shivered
3:32 so someones gonna make this now right and show it to him?
lol, my friends call me tony baloney
To be fair, I've watched other people play this  and they had no problems that you're having. Probably has something to do with the tutorials or actually using the other tools you have.
this game looks so bad
Good ending
well can't wait for the cartoon version of this, good ol' days. LOL
Love seeing mark play FNAF games
I like how the younger mark came out and how he reacts to  the animatronics just like the 2nd game.
Mark should make a fnaf game like this!
Developer of this game if you see this. Please make this a full game. Story missions AND parkour. Take my money I want this. Even if you have to make your own universe not fnaf related
"I'm blue" Aba di aba die
I think they really need to fix the quick time events. They're too complicated
I died laughing at the start at the alternate titles Mark improved up
i can feel the struggle✨
Mark I'll watch in space with Markiplier and listen to distractable when you start playing/reading tutorials in games.
A comment for those getting upset with Scott rejecting this game: he literally initiated the FNAF Fanverse in the first place. That was not required, the fanverse was HIS idea in the first place and it gives those who meet his standards the ability to put their games to the next level and give them more opportunities to grow their ideas. It was a great move on Scott’s part. As this is an incredibly well made game, it’s Scott’s project and he is allowed to say no to a game. Saying you dislike Scott for rejecting a game for a project that HE created does not make sense. Hopefully, this game will have developers jump on it due to the recent gain in popularity.
I never thought that this would see the light of day. I never thought about it at all.
Its foxy
Damn, Lixian got me with that jumpscare nearing the very end. Sheeeeeesh Also yeah Mark didn't finish it all, and the tutorial tells him how to use the floodlights and cameras to help ensnare foxy
Urmom
Scott didn't build FNAF in one game... took him several series to arrive to such.  These developers should take note of that and make Laftoni Baloni
kay-lay-for-nay-ay
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 22!?!
hey mark tu jugaras one night at flumpty 3?
unironically better than security breach
the games great as is whats the issue?
this game is total trash, no wonders its not in fanbase
im shaking and crying rn
I love Mark, I really do, but watching him aimlessly wander in these types of games makes me very nervous and I don't know why
I love this game and the thumbnail I feel like some how the fandom knows what to do with the fnaf series more than Scott
idk why this video is so funny to me but when i say i LAUGHED at the editing 💀
Maybe you should've checked the tutorial.
The sketches are horrible. Lol
its really funny to see all the people get heated in the comments about marks behavior, despite him having adhd
MY HOPS ARE NUTS
the concept of this game is exceptional. being tasked to build a new body for afton by dismantling old animatronics… amazing.
Laftoni Baloni should just hand out Bolani to kids
Kinda mad that he didn’t notice that you had to do more and made it seem like the demo was broken and buggy when it really was just the player this time
You still have not finished the sucker for love game yet mark.
I hope they don’t give up on this, it could do well with a few fixes and polishing
play BPM Bullets Per Minute, One Night At Flumptys 3, or ULTRAKILL again.
Has Mark played this before? I get this feeling of deja vu
4:35 average sims 3 conversation
Yea wonderful possessed mechanical foxy dog that has murdered you multiple time
Great video Mark! keep up the good work, i love you.
The fact that Mark is making out with an crusty falling apart flashing lights animatronic instead of me I mean us
35:00 excuse me sir. On my knees rn.
did mark really tried to hack foxy after he already got 6/6 locks done?
Why does the voice thing sound a lot like mark?
Amazing how someone could skip all of the tutorials and still manage to grasp at what the game wants from you
8:57 GGGGOOOOODDDDD DAAAMMMMNNNN SO FUCKING BRIGHT
Mark "I'm blue",  Me "dabadedabadi"
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
35:08 You better not cause you're the one at fault for not using the tutorial of frustration I'm experiencing watching you right now. Wait... No, NO! YOU DID NOT JUST END THE VIDEO BECAUSE OF YOUR BULLCRAP AND NOT THE GAME!!! DO THE OTHER TASKS! USE THE CAMERA FLASHES TO STUN IT DON'T FOCUS ON 1 THING FOR 20 DOG GAMN MINUTES!!! Re-upload please.
I get not wanting to be too critical about something, but if shit doesn't work right, it needs to be addressed. This game clearly has issues.
6:39 the bite of 87
Please do a full playthrough of this!
The whole line of sight for the bombs are a little jank
I love how this was posted on my birthday 🤣
Oh no not the dreams XD
I'm wondrering, there will be anytime soon a playthrough of The Desolate Hope (man, I really like this game even more than FNaF) from famous youtube players? I really want to see the game played by, for example Mark, and hugely attentioned.
I hope they use Mark's names that he came up with XD
Honestly I think the dev has some really good ideas and some great building abilities! Am I the only one that thinks dog Foxy is like... absolutely adorable? Also, I REALLY liked Afton's voice actor. He had that perfect amount of charm and pleasant people skills with just the faintest hint of danger, I REALLY enjoyed that performance.
3:34 how about chucky frights insteada cucky-pees... I mean chucky che... What is happening to me?
#7 ON TRENDING
3:47 Thank you, Lucian
Def has potential, but man it needs a lot of ironing out in certain aspects
mark in poppy playtime: *climbs on litterally everything he isn't supposed to* mark here: *is supposed to climb but doesnt* how do i get 2 da button?
Anybody else want “Sir Flubbs-A-Lot’s Funfair”? Or “Laftoni Baloni’s Laffapalooza”?
14:28 player: *takes fall damage after falling 2 feet* also the player five seconds later: *jumps like ten feet through the air off a ramp just fine*
I love how the rat goes "sneef"
Happy channel birthday mark!
that foxy dog is really just honestly death LOL
Mark I love you but please for the sake of us all PLAY THE TUTORIALS it is your own fault you are getting frustrated with the game mechanics 😭😭😭
Mark: Laftoniboloni FNAF Fan game creators: Write that down
laftoni baloni is my new favorite game
the thing is that the fact that it didn't make it into the fanverse is the entire identity of aftonbuilt in an alternate universe the fact that it did is its identity
You can tell Security Breach was heavily inspired by Aftonbuilt, from just the mechanics to the graphics and even the storyboard-esc cutscenes.
The map at 17:00 haunts me
omg is that nifty biffy bippy freaking fucking table????? THENIFTYTABLE???????
Five Nights at Foxy's Junkyard 🦊
I hope they get to finish this, I'd really love to.see that
Dude I thought the voice talking at like 10:00 was totally Mark, idk why lol
Finally he’s playing this
This game actually looks pretty good for what it is, I thing scot got mad it looked better than his game so rejected it
Whoossssssp a goood boooooooooooyyy
L A F T O N I   B A L O N I
Laftoni bloni
Anyone else feel like if this game actually came out like a splinter story it would actually succeed,because holy shit is the game great,tho why does the protag jump like fucking superman
*"BOOM! you gotta game everyone wnats to see- w o a"*
Looks like there's a lot of effort put into it, but sadly looks incredibly frustrating in the state it is right now. But it's very promising if they can fine tune the mechanics and fix the issues.
Aftonbuilt?  I only know of  *LAFTONI BALONI*
Great looking game, except for the energy coming from Afton. The voice seems pretty calm and collected considering it's the voice of a notorious child murderer who's been condemned to several decades of suffering and torture in a metal suit... I think he should sound a bit more distorted and angry and more confused about where he is and how it is happening since the most advanced technology he remembers is from the 90s. Overall, it was fun watching you play this game as always Mark 👍
👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
What if someone had a heart attack when the first warning came, and they were just leaving due to their sensitive heart.
The ending deserves all Mark's sufferings! ❤‍🩹
Knowing Mark’s fan base, I would be disappointed if someone wasn’t already working on Sir Flubsalot Fun Fair right now.
Afton built what
"I don't need a tutorial!" Me: "OH BOI, THIS GON BE GUD."
Can we get part 2 to lost I’m maze labrynth
I doubt this will reach Mark, but I just want him to know. My roommates and I watch so manybof your videos, that I'm pretty sure that my dog would recognize you on the street.
Anytime mark says he doesnt need a tutorial i can always expect he gets stuck
Probably can't jump big when you're hurt
The foxy is awesome play more
Hey, this is the same Afton voice actor from the VHS tapes
Are you ever gonna play glitched attraction again I believe the full version is out
I would really like to see this as a finished game, just make it a fan game pls :,,))
I'm not even playing it and it frustrates me with the bomb out of sight thing
Bologna ❌ Baloni ✅
The hello everybody intro never gets boring
seeing Foxy being friendly and seeing Mark coo all over him is something i had no idea i needed in my life
I'm sorry can we stop and appreciate how long it must have taken Lixan to edit the changing title bit at the beginning. Redesigning each and every letter and reordering it perfectly in time WHILST ALSO KEEPING THE MOUSE CURSOR IN FRAME SHOWING HE DID IT ON THE FLY AND DIDN'T JUST EDIT PICTURES OF IT. Lixan you are the master of your trade. So much effort for 20 seconds of a single bit
“Laftoni balonis lafa palooza”
Afton family.....  afton built...... Damn  i don't see than the last name of the afton family
dude this kicks ass
Lixian isn't paid enough for Mark's shenanigannery.
OOOOO AFTONBUILT!? Sorry... literally thought it said Afterbirth...
ok but why is chicago labeled as indiana on the map?
It's a shame this one wasn't taken, it looks so good, a little rough around the edges but it's essentially in a demo form, so that's not surprising at all. Here's hoping it one day gets finished ...
In space with markiplier reference at 2:55
Afton Built: Pacifist Ending
Can you pls pls play little nightmares 2 :D
i have to be honest i did not see the jumpscare at the end coming
Mark saying “oh my god” every 10 seconds is so funny to me and idek why
The anti-stunlock mechanic is so that you have to let it move away before you can stun it again
I'd rather Mark shit on it than annoyingly keep saying it's his crushed dreams which I think is worse
the game needs improvement but is a very good story but then again this dude did this by himself so... yea and plus it's a demo he just needs to finish making it or needs some help so that we can make his dreams come true
It's kind of an insult to take scots creation of the FNAF IP and just turn Afton Robotics into aperture laboratories
Even tho it's still in development, it already is more polished and less buggy than security breach. Maybe that's why Scott rejected it ?
I agree! This is, in fact, a FNAF fan game!
Honestly i feel like the concept could work if instead of animatronic themed you could go more for a robotics company in general. Gives the opportunity for an array of different kind of bots ranging from military to simple household bots that had some issue, hell you could even keep the name style and just make up a robotics company like "Jefferson Robotics" so it could be named "Jefferson built" or something like that.The only issue i see is finding deadly traits in what would be a futuristic 'household robot'.
So you do know about the fanverse thing so Flumpty’s 3 when?
As a Tony, I am both insulted and flattered at Tony Baloni.
first jump scare to ever get me "mark made" at the end of this video!!
I like how mark is constantly asking people to watch in space with markiplier and he never fails to make a reference to it, its truly a gift xD
Youtube
Cool h
Mark should play Ultra Custom Night
28:28 To quote Wade, "Fuck your dreams, fuck your nightmares!"
7:03 da be de!?
i got the epilepsy warning that youtube has before the jumpscare at the beginning so HA!
The Houses Aftonbuilt 👻
Mark is totally right: this game could be a great game just on its own. It doesn’t even have to be in the FNAF universe. This demo made me so excited for the actual full fledged game! 😆
Hi
This would have been such a good game. If Scott didn't reject it.
a tad infuriating watching mark complaining about things he would understand if he played tutorials for any of the games he plays obviously there are some bugs but i feel those are excusable seeing as this is a *DEMO* that will sadly never be finished still fun to watch mark play cus hes charismatic and entertaining
Wait Scott loves fangames tho, he didn't say anything recently did he? Or is it because he left the fnaf scene that mark is bringing up the crushed dreams cuz yeah i could understand why that would upset people making fangames for fnaf if the creator just bounced. I feel bad for Scott and i feel bad for everyone just trying to make fun games.
This game already looks better than Security Breach
20:00 la bolsa de Sabrositos! 🇦🇷
12 minutes in and I have no idea what’s going on
After you got all the tamper locks off, you continued to try and stun the dog, I think that was the issue. You were supposed to complete the other tasks.
Storyboard guy kinda hawt
So the idea of risking your life by scavenging the parts of discarded animatronics is actually a really good one. Some further work bug-fixing, change the names and expand the story a bit, this game could sell.
The robotic voice reminds me of Spamton.
what a terrible game
Fortnite live events are better then the entire existence of fnaf
any one else thought of mr afton from sister location when you sae the title?
28:28 "It's a demo of crushed dreams! It's a demo of crushed dreams!"  Anyone just love seeing Markiplier lose his mind like this?
Does anyone else hear Jeff Goldblum?
Imagine playing a game for the first time, with new mechanics that weren't in other fangames like you are used to, and skipping the tutorials because you think that you will totally see the task list.  People of the planet Earth: Mark "Markiplier" Fischbach, a.k.a not a masochist!
Why didn't you read the tutorial? You can't get mad at the demo when you don't know what you're supposed to be doing.
Laftoni Baloni
Plot twist: The game was afton built
30:00 WHOS A BIG BOY
foxy dog
Wait I thought Mark already did a video on elden ring
here we go again 😁
My brother's name is Tony and we called him Tony Bologna so much so that his first day of preschool he said his name was Tony Bologna 🤣
I love that YouTube recognizes this as the first FNAF game
This would have honestly made such an amazing addition into the canon - Afton's charm being displayed and his charismatic manipulation, the dumb fucking teens who thought the corpse-filled suit was a good idea for their halloween house turning out to have a not-dumb-teen.
He definitely needs to revisit TJOC!!
Markiplier, I have a game for you it’s called detention it’s a Japanese horror game it’s honestly really good. (Idk if you can play it.)
I only watched 7 minutes of this video but I bet the plot is about Michal reviving his father
Whenever mark fell down into that like maze it was like the backrooms to me
You need to use the light it will stun foxy and you need to use the camera to look at the bomb and it will blow up
Mark can you play a game called Glitch Attraction
29:57 *"I'm about to be"* 😭😭💀   memento mori ma guys
the quality of this game is so good
Mark if u finished the tutorial u would know u can detonate the bombs by looking at them trough the camera's.
Hey mark can u pls try to play five nights at sherks hotel pls
this time u want the animatronics to get close
Hey mark, can you play this again... but this time play it the right way and complete the tasks? i would like to see you actually play this game
Mark should play Band Camp Boyfriend
Mark you goofy goober, you absolute silly billy, you fart smella... The task list, like in a hit game among us you gotta do your tasks to finish the level! Great video anyway and man I hope this game will be fully released someday, it's sooo good and such a good idea for a game, Scott doesn't know what he's loosing
i was in the shower when it played the fire alarm and i paused the video panicking that my apartment fire alarm went off mid-shower
this game is so promising and could be so cool if they just scrapped (no pun intended) all the fnaf details and made it their own!
I’m going to be honest this game seem quite frustratingly fiddly and that fact that I was getting annoyed even though I’m not actually playing the game myself is worrying but also Mark I love you but just play the damn tutorial you made watching this even more irritating I’m very sorry I probably seem very harsh and rude but typing my feelings down made me feel a bit better I hope the creators can finish their dream game because it does have potential and has an interesting premise
What a trash heap of bad mechanics, all stuck together in a lazy and badly written way, no wonder it was rejected.
Play inscription
THE TRIPWIRE!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYGGDRVFSUIFVGSHUI
I just wanna know why that car had two shifters at 4:33 Column shift and floor shift
I realised this channel has been created 10 years ago❤
Not Mark casually calling himself a Snack!
This game is amazing and I love it so much but….if anyone is thinking there is gonna be more content on this game probably not it was rejected by scot for the fanveris and is over no new development will be happening that I know of so don’t expect much for it…would love to see this game countine but it’s probably not gonna
Thank you for all of your videos. They make me happy…. I am going through such a rough time… my parents are fighting and I think they might get a divorce…. I’m so scared…. But thank you for always being there, thank so much.
The end was so cute and funny bc he tamed the dog 😂❤️
This was incredibly frustrating to watch, and not for the usual "Bumbum's a Dumdum" reason...  but, very promising, and Scotts a right bastard for rejecting this. Too good for that prick anyway
Laftoni Baloni looks really promising
They made a YouTubers life 2 and it looks like you on the front cover
I might try make laftonis baloni
Still can’t believe this game never got finished, it was soo good.
i firmly believe that the reason scott cawthon didnt fund this is because it looks a lot better and is tons more fun than anything with the FNAF name
I really want to make games now with the names he made up in the beginning of the video just for my amusement
Mark: “I’m blue”  Me: “Da di di da di da”
Bla doo dee, bla doo die, Bla doo dee bla doo die!
Waittttttt mark-at 13:03 u just stood on top of the scooper
Everyday I’m finding more reasons to dislike Scott. Like someone said the concept of someone rebuilding afton and taking after him is terrifying but also extremely intriguing. Not to mention how good it looks even at an unfinished stage (beside the bugs but yknow)
pls do more solar smash, it updated
Mark you gotta check out Five nights at the krusty Krab 3
I love how Markiplier is never actually leaving FNAF :)
Mark: what about my needs? What’s about my needs? What about me?! Amy: 👀
Laftoni Baloni's Laughapalooza!
This game gives me Shadow of Colossus meets Fnaf Vibes honestly
Part 2 when?
Hear me out. It would be cool if Markiplier decided to play Halo
You should play crawl space on Vr. Absolutely terrifying
Mark gives REALLY good advice in the intro. FAN WORK /IS/ WORK. it's YOUR work, and you deserve to be compensated for it! Even if the reason you're doing it is reasons besides money, such as for fun, to work on your skill, or to participate in the fandom, the fact remains that you're doing work that benefits others and you deserve reasonable compensation, or at least the ability to own your own product as unique IP. You can change all the names and tell people "oh yeah, it's definitely heavily inspired by (fandom)" and the other fans will still love it ^^ Plus it broadens the market and the creator space and gives new creativity and style into the world!! MAKE YOUR WORK YOUR OWN, you deserve it! Remember, almost every high-fantasy creation after tolkien was a tolkien fanwork, including DnD!!! Anything that has tall, graceful elves, or huge lumbering treefolk or intelligent, body-builder orcs was inspired by tolkien but is recognized as its own thing and rightfully so! (The equivalents of those creatures back in the day were gnomish keebler elves, dryads, and fat, piggy orcs. "Tree Ent" is literally copyrighted by tolkien's family). And do you know how many people publish physical copies of star trek fanfiction???? You can just buy them, as books! Anyway just remember that your work may not be motivated by money, but you still have to eat and pay rent, and people appreciate what you do. Own your shit! Recognize that fanwork is created by YOU, not the fandom creator!
Mark just completely plays the game all wrong. Doing the same and only task over and over again when it wasn't needed LOL
😌 Well at least he made a friend along the way that’s what truly ma- (*mark hits him with a light and goes back to kill mode*) 😗 oop well nvmind
This would be amazing if it was just changed from animatronics from the FNAF world to automatons like in Syberia I & II or even like in the films The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again. I would love to see the evolution of a kid who was emotionally neglected by parents who began tinkering with toys and made his own friends, starting with the puppy and then escalating higher and higher, and the evolution of madness that comes with a god complex and intense fear of rejection and abandonment, and then gets hired by the government to make military grade automatons to help reduce death toll counts during war, etc. That would be like... very very similar, just far creepier. Especially if you were inadvertently going through things and uncovering truths about the "Creator" as you randomly tinker with these automatons you come across. Kinda like... figuring out the source of WW I dunno, III seems a little too close for comfort so maybe like WWV. WWV sounds cool. They could even name the company World Wide Victory and hint that WWV was planned from the very beginning of company stock market openings.
I think Scott rejected this game because it was too big and risky....but shortly after green lighted security breach. So idk maybe there was another reason. I do hope they advance on this game though, it looks really good.
Shabooski, dammit! SHABOOSKI!
I'm early for me! 23h ago. Woohoo!!!!
Putting in too much work for something that should be more like a grilled cheese. Yet you're going full BLT with extras
It’s a demo of crushed dreams! 😂
someone make a fnaf fan game called “Laftoni Baloni’s lafapuluza” right now!
I know this is off topic but I really think Mark should play cooking companions, am I the only one?
Thank you so much for playing my game mark! Much appreciated :)
When the animatronic said he can show Mark endless possibilities.  Alladin's "Show You The World" popped in my head.  XD
MARK, pls play Five Nights At Flumpty's 3
Can some1 like my comlent
visually 10x better than security breach...
The only real thing I was able to comprehend from this Gameplay was:   Mark really likes poochie. :D
3:05 *his adhd is showing*
Did you know: William Afton actually built all the animatronics in the game! Including FNAF 1 through Fnaf 4! That's probably why the game is named Afton Built!! The Afton family are a pretty famous family from fnaf
This was a awesome game ideal
Mark will literally love any dog , and this is proof of it. Like even if its a demonic enraged soul of a child.
17:30 why is illinois labeled indiana. i know we're trashy, but not that trashy. also lake michigan is gone. what kind of SCP set up is this.
I hope this gets finished.
"A foolish man cries about a hole in his pocket, while a wise man uses it to scratch his balls." -Sun Tzu (art of war)
I love it
LIXIAN IS GETTING TO GOOD AT JUMPSCARES. GOD DAMN
I think the scoops only worked once (to get the locks) and thats why there were numerous, foxy kept getting up after the first
gaming
omg fnaf omg omg 😲
Markiplier makes love to the Deadlights 2022
Imagine if scott actually made drippy in next fnaf
Think this game is set right after 3, you actually save springtrap from the fire
I can understand to why Scott didn't choose Afton Built for the fanverse.  Considering the other fanverse games are either in relation to Fnaf, but with twists, or is completely made up.  Afton Built is a fan game that takes place after Fnaf 3, and it's somewhat connected to the lore Scott made to Fnaf.  But I'm sure he still liked the game.
what the dog doin?
I really want to find a way to help support this game to help complete it.
Oh i see why it was rejected. Scot probably wanted something that didn't connect to the main storyline. This connects to the main storyline, cause it seems to fill in the gaps between FNAF 3 and Help wanted  It's basically "This is what Scott might create" instead of "I'm going to make a game based on a franchise i love" kind of deal
I like the part where he says "lafoni"
So, is this in connection with the books?? Im currently reading the books, Im on 8 now. It gives me like, vibes based on that (the little end stories with Larson and the-ya know-the SITUATION)
40:05 is that... loss???
If you rearrange the letters of aftonbuilt is spells FAIL BUTTON. Thanks for the great vids.
It really seems like it would have been a cool game. Shame.
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Petition for Mark to finish playing DSaF and Dormitabis
I really love the drawing style of the placeholder stuff. It looks so good :D
For the scary building: Mark's Pliers
reply with laftoni baloni or micky will copyright you
I just thought about this is the fnaf games were you got your dogs Name from?
I just recently broke both my feet and so I cannot walk as a teenager is really jarring to one day be outside and running and doing everything I love and the next to be stuck in bed all day long in pain. Watching these videos is something I look forward to everyday in bed rn. Thank you mark for all the amazing content I really need it
More.
How you not noticed the task list xD
theft king covered on his channel what happened with Aftonbuilt. If anyone is curious.
Sneef
Mark, I'm gonna hold you to that, you know...
Markiplier, the Gentleman that makes me Laugh, And my Laugh makes everyone around me Laugh, Love ya mate from Australia
12:21
XD
i love this
Foxy is such a good boy
Mark the best dog tamer ☺️
Mark I'm pretty sure that the person was mike and he was getting springtrap or his "farther"
Mark coming up with Laftoni Baloni had me in literal TEARS laughing
I love the FNAF Fan Games and especially when Mark plays it
You gotta complete it maaark
Is the movement for this ripped from mirrors edge? The momentum build up from running, the leap, even the sound of speed gaining and footsteps sounds near identical
28:23 😂😂😂😂😂
Mark: **Talking to Foxy like a big cute puppy dog.**  The murdered child inside Foxy: Am I a joke to you?
Could you do the new flumpty game that came out
Laftoni balconi like if you agree
Frights started in 3 but it's in the books as it's own spin off
Nice #1 on trending for gaming
so he didn t want to help w this game but he was completely fine with Security Breach... Wtf Scott
Hey mark you should react to five nights at markepliers
Sup mark
Amazing concept, I love the ideas it just needs work to fix all the small things, but that's why it's a demo.
and why he ourple 💀
OMG! Leave it to Mark, of all people, to turn Foxy into Fetch... ffffffoooor a few seconds!🤣😂
I think some of the sfx in this are from Resistance
Me, patiently praying for him to find the task list.
ah yes markiplier
Are you going to play JR's in june
🐶
I kinda want to see this as a seris since there is more levels
Fnaf fan games are still being made to this day, I love this community
Lawyer in mickey's ear-headband and suit and voice is coming to knock on your door mark. There is no escape from them.
Why didn't you look at the objectives you completed the hacking portion but you needed to close all the floodgates and more
Honestly i see why Scott hadn't put this in fanverse. From a studying developers standpoint, the glitches and lack of polishing can be pretty hard to get the big thumbs up from larger developers. So i don't blame Scott for being harsh to the developers when it came to the game itself, because yes you can infact polish a ton of the game even without the use of funding. I will say though this game so far looks great. The developers shouldn't neglect the game like they're doing, because something neglected as much ad this is will get denied. Scott thought it had potential but the finished potential mixed with the glitches can really put a game in the dump. So i hope they end up wanting to finish it in the future. For the sake of the game itself
I do gotta say, as cool as this game is it does seem pretty far away from the FNAF universe. Not a bad game idea but it seems like the only thing connecting the game with fnaf is the paint coating and would be better if it just wasnt a fnaf fangame. This seems like a dlc based off of fnaf moreso than its own thing. I can kinda see why Scott would think this was too risky with how different the games feel is
Mark is pretty bad at this "line of sight" thing for the bombs.
happy 10 years today! also its my birthday! this youtube channel was made on May 26 2012
Mark ignoring tutorials and getting frustrated at the game mechanics is a tale as old as time.
Play some bendy the ink machine idol
I can't wait to see Laftoni Baloni manifest into reality the way Bigface did
Ty mark, this is what YouTube needs more of
I hope everyone here is doing well today. If you're reading this, you're an absolute legend, an inspiration to those around you, and you do deserve to feel happy and be appreciated. Much love my friend.
Hey Mark you should try out this game called “born into fear”!! It looks pretty scary
This would be perfect for the sequel of FNAF
I love the concept for this game I hope more of it comes out or it gets enough money to improve itself
🤔
You should play sinister turmoil sewers it's a great fnaf fangame
Honestly, I’d love a mechanic in this game (or some successor to this concept) where you could tame one of these animatronics. Imagine turning this Feral Foxy into a friendly robo-doggy that you could upgrade and bring on missions. It’d be like having you own version of Blade Wolf from MGR!
WE NEED MORE LAUGH YOU LOSE
It seems theyve coded in a time lock to prevent you spamming the skillcheck minigame (probably resets on entry thats why consecutive fail), also seems the machines get more aggressive the more you progress (movespeed/movestyle) even allowing jumping where before they can only use the bridges. im feeling your move system shoudlnt protect you so the bots get it too (dont assume you can get out of reach). Guess the start is to set up multiple traps/ complete side objectives, then go after the animatronics since they ramp up in difficulty quickly...
Narrator: _"Although he was enjoying roaming around in the junkyard, it was at __20:26__ that Mark realized he is playing a horror game"_
The crerator could make it set in the SCP world and they could be an agent of one of the many factions trying to get to an anamoly before the foundation arrives. Then when they go dabbing into how it works it all goes horribly bad
I really hope done fan makes a Laftoni Baloni game for Mark. Also, I don't know if this is intentional, but a lot of people view Mark as the unnamed security guard. So that animatic looks familiar
I need you to play red dead 2 multiplayer with Bob wade and jack!
🤣😊🥰🐻 🧸
BTW mark if you sprint up onto the scaffolding up top and press P on the object you need to push you will win automatically even having done nothing else.
I like how Mark found the spotlights in the last two minutes lol
You almost got me with the jump scare and I was like having a panic
If I ever do get the chance to talk to Mark in person or he sees this comment by pure chance I want him to know I’m willing to let him in I know I play hard to get and I didn’t realize this until recently
I can't tell if these playthroughs would be better or worse if he followed the tutorials lol  (Also I wish I could see mark do a complete playthrough)
I really hope this comes out to be a good game honestly I agree with mark if they slapped a new skin on everything and gave it some slight story re-adjustments it could be legendary on top of it being its own game!
this game looks so cool, unique, and fun. maybe seeing Mark playing it will encourage them and help then know what to change!!
10:07 that's either Mark voice acting here, someone doing a impeccable job doing an impression of his voice, or I'm going delusional bc I'm watching too many Markiplier videos.
Mark I like your videos but I'm from Turkey and sometimes I did not understand what you say. Can you please loding Turkish transtation? Thank you!☺️
22:27 22:47 25:27 29:47 32:33 38:52
4:07 😂
I absolutely love the idea of a follower of Afton helping to revive him from death. We could have had a game where we play as Vanny trying to bring back Afton in some form.  Imagine if a game switches between two characters every night. One is the more traditional FNAF game, the other is an Afton follower trying to rebuild him. On the last night, you finally get him to put into a body, but you are not shown who, just that it was successful. Then the last bit of traditional gameplay ends as you are cornered by the bonnie you have been keeping away the entire game, and it speaks to you in Afton's voice. All through the game you could tell the Bonnie was the smartest animatronics, but not obvious, but clear enough that the fact it was Afton the entire time makes complete sense. And it ends with the other character you played, Vanny in her suit, walking into the room and being instructed by Afton to kill you.  But the Afton twist at the ends needs to be very well done, to the point where it makes sense but no one would have guessed it.
Mark: 7:02  A particular song in my mind: Allow me to introduce myself
the way he died when he had so many of those d x s pressed anfter so much time it took he died geting stuck jump araund like a ninja why is this actually making me mad cuz he failed it was afoidable
Hi
more
This is a really cool game. I see why it was rejected by Scott Cawthon. The whole download the soul from the springtrap suit thing is a bit much and hard to swallow as canon.
That cutscene was better than security breach
I hate to say it and I'm gonna be real. FNAF fan games are very tiresome. Nuff said. I feel sorry they got turned down, but take it as a experience. At least they know what to do next. People like Puppet combo, 616 games and Darkstone Digital are doing their own thing and they making it just fine. This game is alright, but it shouldn't have to do anything with the FNAF's universe.
Laftoni Baloni has gotta be the stupidest and funniest shit I've ever heard 😂
Scott didn't like it, but it has the same gameplay quality as Security Breach in terms of bugs and uncertainty. This is almost better, but I can't judge.
Why he ourple
Isn't afton like the purple guy?
Æ
This is how security breach should have played
Mark: *Skips tutorial* Also Mark: *Gets angry because he doesn't know how to play*
I hope mark does a part 2
To be honest, I don't like a game based on helping Afton. At least, the way the game makes it front and center, and blatantly obvious that you're helping a child killer. I would like it more if your character was unknowingly helping him. Like, maybe the character is a salvager and their attempts to acquire animatronics to sell for profit also set Afton loose unintentionally.
The thumbnail, foxy Yeager
6-12 months from now we will all be gathered back here to watch Mark's new video of a playthrough of Sir Flubs A Lot's FunFair. I am counting on someone to make this a game please!!! 🤣
that scooper was definitely the scooper from sister location
Watching Mark play this game was enjoyable. The story of crushed dreams is very sad and I like how Mark considered that and wants to support the developer team that worked on this.
pls part 2
Mark you should try playing cooking companions
Plz play Mr hoops playhouse 2🐰
This looks very interesting It's kinda sloppy But it definitely looks promising
"Okay, so his body blocks it. That's why." **standing on bomb** "Why won't it go off?!"
Who is this Drippy that he keeps reffering to at the start?
I can't live without watching your videos mark always fun and chill
I originally saw this game on Fusionzgamer's channel and I love this game a lot. Seeing Mark play it makes me happy that he is playing a Fnaf fangame that even tho it didn't make it into the Fanverse, it is very well made and unique.
i want an actual”Laftoni Balonies Laughapoloza” game
I understand and appreciate what Mark is saying at the beginning of making something that's your own and not doing things in the Freddy universe but it denies the reality that being part of the FNAF universe is in itself what people want, whether it's for exposure or the personal connection etc that's what they want
this looks more like Stranger Things upside down world
29:52 raiden talking to bladewolf
I feel like I seen you play this a long time ago
Laftoni Baloni.
I definitely wish I could add some more FNAF levels combining all the 80s arcades and architecture that I grew up to as a kid. People say what they will about "security breach" but that entire "fazbear center" mega inspired the possibilities you can do with FNAF, absolutely love the world you explore in "security breach" and designing another world that has an 80s style showbiz style for a FNAF dlc would be such a dreamm!
Mark: *having trouble*: "It's a just a Demo!" Also Mark: "I'm not going to read the tutorial!" Mark: *having trouble*: "I don't know what to do!" Also Mark: *Opens menu and not notices task list*
Can you please try out wilfenstein the new order
I don't get why people get mad and triggered over the fact Mark skip a tutorial. I mean, some people just skip tutorial. I'm sure some of you do that sometimes too. And while he may make the game harder by skipping it, I mean this is Mark. This is not the first time he do this. He often just skip difficulties and just wing it. It's kinda his style, so Its really funny to see these snowflake get triggered while I am enjoying his content positively and find it funny.  And I agree with Mark, that clamping mechanic and hacking is very tedious and redundant at the same time. Sure it fun the first time around but do it many time the mechanic will get pretty tired quickly. And as far as this demo got shelved, I can see the reason why honestly. It's not surprise it get rejected as for me the mechanic is just too dumb and plain.   Cannot take criticism? then learn to take one. There is a reason why feedback and game review exist. So they can improve what they lacking. If everyone say it's have potential then you will never understand the reason for some group of people like me and other, find it boring. So learn to grow thick skinned. We are not hive mind, some of us have a thing we called opinion.  P.S: Don't even bother to argue with me and make comment, I closed my reply notification so I don't have to dealt with bunch of you silly wanker and LMFAO over this stupid situation where people get mad from silly thing. Chill bro, it's just a video.
wait so are you supposed to be friends with the dog in the end or was it bugged?
Hiii mark can u pin me I love ur vids I don’t care if u don’t love ya bud❤️
He is back on number 1
We got the new dog
Holy shit as of now this video is #1 for gaming

I think the issue and why Mark was unable to finsih the level is because he didn't finish the secondary objectives the level had. it probably has systems in place to stop the level from being completed without doing them
#1 on trending damn
Apparently the reason this didn't get into the fanverse is because it was "too ambitious" smh
I love you
Perfect editor when he was making names lmao
Mark: gets upset screams what am I doing wrong.  Also mark: refuses to read a check list and tutorial notes. I've never been so annoyed at Mark before but I'm genuinely frustrated with him FKN READ JUST STOP AND READ.stop brushing over everything and READ. Anyway
I'm hoping mark plays the full version of this it's pretty dope
Imma die if a game comes out after mark has given all the advice of what to do and what to name it 😂
Watching Mark has shown me that having him with me in a horror situation is ideal. First he'll plan everything and execute a pretty smart strategy. Then when the monster comes, he'll panic and become perfect bait while I enact his plan and escape. :)
Mark: Scotts Tots !  Me: *Has a flashback to that one The Office episdoe*
I loooooooove the animatic!!!!!!!
lol they dident even try to make Michigan XD at 4:28
I can see why Scott didn't choose this one to make it into the official fangames, like idk it feels a bit too out there for the universe, i'm not sure i can explaim it.  that being said gosh i love the premise of this game, the concept looks really cool and like Mark said, it could work really well as it's own standalone universe, i agree that the creators have something of potential here and i hope Scott's rejection doesn't discourage them from working on it, they could come up with a really cool game, be it an unofficial FNAF game or a completely original game
Suggestion: Mark, get in contact with the developers to work on making this game it's own property. Maybe as a tie in to your series' multiverse. With the warfstache interview robot being the william in it.
Purple guy haha I prefer blue bud
omg poochie
Drippy is a masterpiece, and the fact you were so proud of him makes it more lovely ^_^
The concept of this game is brilliant to understanding how Afton survived the FNAF 3 fire outside of it simply being stated “Yeah, he lived.”
who else thought the character we play as is cute in the animation story sequence?
I can't wait for a future 3 Scary Games to feature a location like Sir Flubs-a-Lot's Funfair.  I know the internet won't disappoint
THE LOOOIOOOOOOOOR
Noice. I think the game has a lot of potential, hope they continue it in some shape or form. 😁❤
WOW. Sadly this game will never be finished. Dang scott, having them sign a non profit agreement. Else they could have raised their own money to continue it. But as mark said.. They could rebrand, change the characters to be more original.  Ooo, maybe even work it around to be a warfstache game. Having that interview animatronic be the replacement for william, add some unique replacements for the other robots. Add in some nods to mark's works, including his clothing, etc. Surely mark could possibly approve that, since it would also advertise his things. Plus that warfstache interview robot in an official horror game... Yeah I could see that, especially if mark voices it xP.
laftoni baloni ❤️
As he stated "The other 3 quarters were not final enough and were not properly optimized yet for inclusion in the demo. These areas included the car graveyard".
laftoni baloni.
Mark's got a point. It doesn't necessarily need to be fnaf based to be scary. Look at Mr. Hopps Playhouse, Poppy Playtime and Case Animatronics. They utilize similar aspects, and yet, they are all entirely different. If anyone has a good idea for a scary game, then put it out there. Just don't base it off others so it can be a unique experience.
If someone doesn’t make a game called Lagtoni Baloni I will be very upset.
I feel really fucking sorry for the editor who have to spell whatever nonsense mark was saying and arrange the characters
I love it so much that the developer wants to keep making the game, even tho it didn't make it into the Fanverse. I don't know if it will become 100% finished, but I'm happy none the less. This is really one of the best FNaF Fangames I've ever seen... and I'm a fan since the very beginning. Cool to see you play it Mark!
3:47 the reason I love editing in Mark’s videos
Am I the only one who noticed the car had 2 shifts, one of the steering wheel and the other between the seats? 😂
watching mark try not to curse this game because of its bugs is so entertaining
laftoni-baloni 4:02
Bet this would've been better then security breach if the game were actually to be completed besides that this could be a completely different game and still be cool
can you play ultra custom night
13:10 ASMR
Hi there! I found a game I would love for you to play mark! The game is called “Noctambulant”, the game has lore that can be difficult to figure out. But it also has multiple different endings. You should play it!
Mark are you going to play the full release??
Afton is so rude to Arizonans wtf
Am I the only one who think that the personal assistant at the start talks and looks like  Spamton G. Spamton? It's a weird connection but I've just noticed it...
believe in Jesus
haha the protagonist drives a british van
Are you ever going to do a play through of The Last of Us Part 2?
This kinda came out of no where, but I had this idea for this game, that the animatronics learn from previous mistakes, so for example, after already hitting it with the caw and its the second time it starts to chase you, it could see/recognise previous behaviours that are odd/obvious, like you waiting for it to get closer. So it could it can either try to bait the trap (if it knows where it is) or rapidly change speed/go to the player via a different/longer route. And maybe in different levels, where the animatronics are different, they could need certain criteria before they get close (makes harder and more risky to bait). For example this  animatronic only goes to you when it's stalking you (look away from it) and due to the different t nature of the animatronic, the cue would be a noise instead of seeing it (like it standing on something or getting ready to attack) (In short, when one animatronic may be reckless, and can take multiple hits or needs bigger traps, another may be super careful and hard to bait/convince)
So much potential! I loved the sketch cutscenes. I hope someone revisits the development of this game
So the more you rage the more YOULL GET FUCKING HURT SO STOP YOUR. RAGE
Scott did this game so dirty man
See, something I think Mark is missing with these fangames is that people LOVE to make their own takes and branching universes off of a brand you love. And I can't of course blame Mark at all since I sometimes share his thought process "why are you giving this existing brand your own original concept that you could be better using for your very own project" I get that feeling. However now I realize it's basically the same concept while making fanart, you want to express your love towards the thing you're a fan of, you got a great idea for the thing you enjoy and it's absolutely fine to expand it. I just got a weird feeling since he was pushing the idea of "you can make your own thing it doesn't have to be linked to another existing thing" since that Sonic.EYX game and here again in a more present manner. Once again, not to blame or condemn this way of thinking (since I too share it sometimes) but like I said, there's no shame in doing your fan projects if you feel passionate about it.
Mark your rage is not gonna help no wonder your going to the hospital so many times
The guy who voices Afton sounds kind of like Gaku Yashiro
25:32 Mark: WHOS GOT A BIG BUTTT! *looks at Bonnie* Mark: we’ll certainly you do. Bonnie: *:)* Mark: but we’re not looking for you rn. Bonnie: *:(*
Tiny Rat Go *SNEEF*  One minute in and I'm satisfied.
So wait at the start he ripped Springtrap (likely springtrap) in half and looked like he was trying to get him out but did he throw him back in the building or was that the back of the van? I’m not sure can someone give me some insight.
:D
It’s Morbin time
The part in the beginning about making a game not based on anything and completely original would actually be kinda hard for someone who is just starting out with making games. FNAF is the perfect framework for a horror game and it makes it easier to develop.
Thing is mark they still need money, not going to do them a lot of good if they can reskin it.
You should play Amanda the adventurer
I thought the fire detector noise was real I had a heart attack
#1 trending for game
How the hell does Mark only have 32M subs yet he regularly makes #1 on trending? It just doesn't make much sense.
I just saw a video on this game!! Cool to see you touch upon it mark !
Missed the classic fnaf 2 Dangling stars for the thumbnail
Damn it mark, READ! love ya mark.
we want more PHASMOPHOBIA with BOB and WADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sometimes mark you sound like the.................Click
isn’t william british tho?? or I think they forgot that..🤨
Aftonbuilt Diffferent
The way Mark explains how you can turn a fan project into a original IP is amazing
It’s the mall from the first book silver eyes
How Mark sees Foxy:
Let's gooo another post form the King of YouTube
Now this is an ending no one expected, but everyone deserved.  1# on trending for gaming!       meanwhile, BREAKING NEWS FROM JIM! MARKIPLIER ACCIDENTLY SHITS ON ALREADY CRUSHED DREAMS! LOCAL MARKIPLIER ADOPTS SCRAPYARD FOXY DOG AND CALLS IT "POOCHIE". JIM BACK TO YOU AT 11 JIMS.
This video is proof that anyone who’s played FNAF has always wanted a pet Foxy
The game actually looks cool and legit. If it was worked on more, it could be one of the best fanmade FNAF games. Although, the comic portion was a bit cringe since it wasn't complete, especially hearing the impression of Afton; they probably could've done a different concept tbh 💀
I don't know how Lixian puts up with Marks insanity but that is why they are such a great team.
Can you please play sunkys school house
Ten years from now: My friend: want to get on the new call of duty game Me: sorry the new laftoni boloni game just game out My friend: LETS GOOOOO If this is not the future I don’t want to be in the future
That bomb thing: Time to do a little trolling
i liked scott's tots...
More please i require more
Hi, it would be fun to see you play a scary game on Roblox called Judy. You could do a video revisiting Roblox and play other scary games. Btw I love your content, keep doing what you do.
As a person with epilepsy, thank you so much for the flash warning. Love the re-naming attempts lol.
Lunkys laughapalooza
Mark doesn't play the tutorial and gets mad at the game for 15 minutes about a mechanic that is explained in the tutorial 🗿
The devs watching this:
i went to chuck e. cheese's for my bday when this was posted :D
Hey mark your birthday is June 28 and your born is June 28 1989
I was prepared for the jumpscares but I still almost jumped out of my chair 😂❤️ I love horror games and especially when Mark is playing them!❤️😂 And favorite moments of the who video is definitely when Mark was messing with the title of the game😂
"We did it, wait, what did we do?"
Scott suing you over making a horror game featuring murderous animatronics would be like if back in the 80s the people that made friday the 13th could just sue the Halloween people. it just aint like that. so please, horror game design enthusiasts stay enthused. we love what you're making, even if it needs some polish ♡
4:21 WTF ARE TUTRALS
Wtf are Tuturals
It is such a shame this game got rejected, not to throw shade at the other fan games but this one adds so much more uniqueness into the mix instead of the basic "point and click" style game the franchise and many of it's fan creations are known for!  Really hope this dev can turn this around into it's own horror game with original assets because it definitely works as a horror game!!!
Mark have you ever thought of creating your own horror game?
Mark getting stupidly angry over games when he didnt play the tutorial and spends the whole time doing it wrong will never not be funny lmao
Yes the game could of been something completely different but the reason it was made in the first place was because Scott reached out to them, toke months to respond to a team that didn’t had money just to tell them “nah here’s some cash so you can pay people wages but not to make a game”
Too bad Scott had to be an asshole to the creator and all the people who worked on this game. Like, thank you for leading them on and wasting their time and even not even paying them.
Mark's going to make Chica jealous talking to foxy dog like that 🥺🐕
Not even gonna lie, Ive read it as aftonbutt since the video came out
i wish this couldve been finished, it seems so cool
I wanna see this aaaall
love this keep up the good work and love the part where you kept changing the name of the game
Scott is a POS anyway, so screw him. I hope these devs find a way of reworking what they made into something original, because I’d really love to see and play more of what they’ve started on, here. If the devs read this, don’t let Cawthon keep you from creating! Please keep working on this and creating something amazing that you can put your heart and soul into! 💗
“Is this from the goofy moofy?” Is it?
is this fanmade or original????
happy 10 year anniversary of your channel Mark!!!
mark. ur probably the only person keeping me alive. i love you so much. thank u for being here.
Jumpscares     21:48  28:26  31:36  34:55  38:51 good boy 41:25 good boy betrayal
It looks okay, but the gameplay needs a _lot_ of work.
Mark, you really started to annoy me when U didn't realise there was multiple objectives, and you had already shocked foxy enough and that you shouldve moved onto the next objective and I was literally screaming at you
the bite of 87? more like the bite×87
tbh lixian's editing is amazing and just makes the video a hundred time better and funnier <3
@38:43 "And this is how man befriended a wild dog". 10/10
The Laftoni Baloni cracked me up
I must say, with all the laughs and tears in my eyes, this is definitely one of the best FNAF moments I've got to experience. And I bet Mark is also pretty satisfied with this video.
I understand why Scott rejected this game. The mechanics are about as broken as Hello Neighbour and we all know what happened to that game...
I know you have it so long Markiplier
mark: "it looks like a rat the more i look at it" mark after 2 sec: "WHOS A GOOD BOYYYYY SMOOCH SMOOCH"
When will people in the comments Stop lying and spreading misinformation Scott doesn’t even give off “bad vibes” at all nor did the “success go to his head” nor is he “only doing it for the money” or “to only make merch” is completely untrue and the fact that these trying to use the aftonbuilt drama to try and prove this goes to show how delusional these people really are to the point where they are still trying to find any excuse to bash Scott even after the controversy that happened like 6 months ago also if these people weren’t delusional and actually did research(which they don’t) then they would know that the real reason the game didn’t make it in wasn’t because “Scott wanted merch ” but rather because the project was to ambitious and because of the fact that the developer broke his nda The fact that these people are ignoring the fact that the developer broke his nda and are trying to make Scott sound like the bad guy here is completely ridiculous and goes to show that these did zero research at all about this situation
7:05 IM BLUE dabude dabuda dabudee dabuda dabudedabuda.
The black goop that was growing seemed like the stuff from stranger things
Omg, Markiplier. How much I frowned and facepalmed at you trying to activate the bombs, when you weren't in its line of sight.  That's what tutorials are for xD
7:00 I want a whole compilation of Mark's "I'm [blank]" edits, there's been so many times where mark says "I'm [something]" and the camera immediately zooms in on him in a clever gag
I’ll say this game doesn’t fit in with the fnaf universe Scott created, but it can be a fantastic fangame
"is that the real laftoni baloni?!"
Throughout this video I am censured for markiplier's santiy
my hops, my hops, my lovely lady flops
The Suicide of Rachel Foster You must play Mr. Mark
I do honestly hope the game will get finished as it's awesome even with the bugs, as it's early in development of course.
pov the ending jumpscare scared you :)
Markiplier : " Lixian make me funny "  Me : THE POWER OF THE EYE ZOOOM
Play the book of blood
A
I guess the character we play as must’ve gone straight to the heist after their tap dancing lesson- The constant tippie tappies whenever they walk is so funny 😂
Whu
AftonBuilt? No, *Laftoni Baloni!*
4:26 its the adventure line
I do have to feel bad for the people who worked on this. They poured so much of their own time and money into it while Scott just silently strung them along, only to out of nowhere just decide 'nah it's not getting the green light'. Of course it's a bit more complicated than that but that's the simplified version and I feel bad for them.
The person talking at the first part could pass as Mark, though with a bit higher voice.
markiplier is actually helping rather than shitting on it.
this video was uploaded on my birthday
I'm imagining the confused looks of Henry and Chica through the door... "Does Dad have a secret dog locked away in there? All that love should be for us!"
Oh ... I'm blue da ba dee da ba ... ^^
3:30 of course that was the letter of Mark’s downfall 😔
Now I get what both Mark and MatPat were doing wrong. Like Afton said, you need to tamper with the locks AND destroy the animatronic after that. The problem is that you spend so much time on the locks (specially due to the bugs) that you forget that second part.
omg omg omg
i like this video it was good😀😃😄😁
I'm watching this in school. I am in class watching this. If I fail my english test I'm blaming you. /j
mark, i had to stop watching game grumps because arin's whole "im not going to even attempt to learn what the game wants me to learn in order to play it and then get mad that i don't understand" BS with tutorials. its no fun watching someone deliberately ignore the creator and then give the creator flack for the players own stupid decision to ignore the game.  unfortunately i see you starting to do the same thing, and its just as unenjoyable. hoping you get things back on track
the explosive probably wasnt going off by the line on sight rule i think maybe because the foxy was blocking the visual so you literally cant see it cuz he is body blocking it lmao, mark said it seconds later, nvm
Five Nights at Treasure Island full version has long been released. When will Mark play it. It's basically THE BEST fnaf fangame made for now.
Basically, the best TL:DR: on  this game is that there was a lot of miscommunication between the team and Scott with Scott being preoccupied with a LOT of stuff and, in the end, the concept cost too much money and Scott was not providing enough funding to see it progress any farther.
TLDW: Mark beating up an undead dog for over half an hour.
It would be fun if Markiplier made a video game as his next big project
man, I love laftoni baloni
Wow Mark hasn't played ONAF 3? I really thought he did.
was scary until mark started making fun of foxy at 29:50
onaf3 :(
This game has a lot of interesting mechanics. I also have no idea what the hell is going on.
Sorry Mark, you're absolutely one of my favourite YouTubers. But holy shit why is it that most YouTubers don't read or do tutorials, and then proceed to get mad at a game when things don't work because they didn't do the tutorial and didn't learn how to do things
Best part ever😂 28:47
the reason why this was rejected is because Scott thought the project was way too ambitious for such a small team, and too risky of a financial investement. Pretty much he didn't want Security Breach 2.0
HI DADDY MARKIPLIER 😁
Ayyy it's the Markiplier playing _Aftonbuilt!_
40:10 Mark : _(Burns Foxy's Robotic Retinas Off)_ Foxy : _(Goes hostile and attacks Mark again)_ Mark : _"DUDE, CHILL. IT WAS A PRANK !!!"_
You dont even Edit your own Video ?? 🥺
Only markimoo can make an evil eating robot, sounds like a good small dog
oh I know! the original name of this might be "FNAF: New Generation"  forgive me if I'm wrong!
I feel like people complaining about ( or mean-spiritedly poking fun at ) Youtubers skipping the tutorials forget that,  1: Information overload is a real issue — especially in heavily story-based games — and if the first 17 minutes of a game's interactivity is only "WASD is move and space is jump"  then I think it's reasonable that a player would want to actually play a game soon ( especially anyone playing for an audience that may grow impatient, or if the player has only limited time to play games in the first place ), and thus choose to skip to the action if presented the choice. Which leads me directly to... 2:  The dev put a button in the game to skip the tutorial, thus skipping the tutorial is a dev-approved choice and should be accommodated just as much as choices about language settings or mouse sensitivity. I personally do not believe that a player should be punished or insulted for playing a game the way the creator has allowed them to.  I just wanted to get that off my chest, sorry. I hope everyone has a wonderful day and gets to pet a cute dog.
Yes it can be any building set on fire by a rotting corpse in an attempt to kill his immortal farther stuck in a bunny suit... bunny suit that was retrieved in that cinematic... sure if you got an idea for a scary game you should make it no matter what context but this game was clearly supposed to be intrinsically tied to the FNAF lore..
Mark : "This is already a crushed pile of broken dreams. I do not want to shit on it." _(10 Minutes Later)_ [35:05] Mark : "I. Will Not. Shit. On a Pile of Broken Dreams. That Scott Cawthon already shat on."
the game isn't bad. it's mark who's an idiot XD
Okay so, I don't interact with the FNAF universe outside of Mark's channel too much, can someone explain to me why there is an official *fanverse,* aka what I'm assuming is non-canon shit made by fans for fans, and how the hell it can get _rejected_ by the creator... EVEN THOUGH IT'S A FAN GAME?!?
I wonder if we’re playing as Michael I assume because the character is purple and covered in bandages and a mask. Funky
for the cut seen, I think it was Michael (after sister location) stealing William/springtrap, but it could also be someone (still think its Michael based of how he tried covering his face and eyes) else
KUL
Please  play  Baby's  Nightmare Circus  theory
It’s a shame Mark couldn’t have been more clueless and figure out the side lore of the game much quicker then he had original planned🤓
I immediately noticed that It was William Markiplier was talking to
that was cool
[4:16/16:34] Mark : "I'm pretty sure I need some tutorials..." Game : _(Offers Mark an Important Tutorial)_ Mark : _"Eh, I'm good... I think ?"_
Wow 148k likes and it's been up for 14 hours really shows how good and how much people like him same with me jack and you built my childhood love your vids
If only you had found out about the use of cameras
He's better then that
You should dye your hair red again
4:16 Mark : "I'm pretty sure I need some tutorials..." _Literally every other horror game he plays on the channel : "Oh, so NOW you want them ?"_
16:52 bro what am I doing with my life 😂 why was this so funny?!
I would absolutely love to see Mark play the full and have this be a full stand alone game it's great
Had to check the description for the editor, wanna give credit where it’s due…. Lixian my dude great job with the title screen when Mark was “changing” it 😂😂
Mark not skipping to tutorial, is it really the mark i know?
The Devs should take the basics of Aftonbuilt and make their own Animatronic Universe off of it. If you can't get Patreon Funding on Aftonbuilt. Just make a similar game with a completely different lore, yet similar gameplay. Put in Easter Eggs if your FNAF needs aren't yet satisfied and call it at that.
I LOVE that Foxy model and the sound design going with it. It's so good
I'm disappointed that Scott didn't accept this entry into his Fan-verse Initiative. Concept was stellar and The Demo shows potential.  I guess he was either too scared it would surpass or end up like FNAF Security Breach.
While he was talking about the movement mechanics, I couldn’t help but notice the incredible amount of detail from the fisheye effect to how you can hear the player move through the air as you can in real life if you were jumping like that
thought it was Ultron for a second there
Why do I feel that the strange robot who got into Mark's tablet is an evil one and when you finish the game he will come into you as a final boss because his plan was twisted and will destroy humanity . Just think about to : Finding him in strange place and have literly the same plan as twisted robot villains ( Saving humanity "IN HIS WAY" ) , he is 90% for sure he is the twisted villain in the game .
I kinda got idea, In fredbear pizzeria with markiplier?
This game is dope
목소리 멋지다
26:26
Hey Mark!!!!!!! You really should play Evil Dead! You , Wade, Bob and Jack!
Its so sad that cawthon disapproved this amazing game...
"How would I know what is and isn't available in the demo?"  Because it tells you, Mark. It literally told you when you tried. That's how you'd know. My lord, man.
you need to get back on people's playground, there were more items/maps added and more realistic gore textures, etc. plus it was fun to watch you.. SLAUGHTER.... so yeah! :D
Poor Aftonbuilt, so many problems with it's entrance to the FanVerse, but has a nice concept and aesthetic!
M
Is this the bite of 87? still cant find it...
I hate how so often Mark is told exactly what to do by the game and then he just completely disregards it. The game tells him "to detonate bombs, you have to be in direct line of sight." Then, when he tries to detonate a bomb that isn't in direct line of sight, he's utterly confused as to why it's not working.
Flubber is disney too bud
This game really sucks
,
Mark made the horror game into a rage game
The character ya play as sounds like they have suction cups when they're walkin on some surfaces, are they an octopus?
laftoni baloni  big boi
a Really good and Fun Game Concept i hope to see more projects from the Devs
"I can no longer jump" shouldn't have spent so many in the jump circle
i love you'r videos❤
well we got the happy ending lmao
WOOOOO u finely played it
Markiplier both refusing to do the tutorials, and looking at the menu that shows he has multiple objectives (multiple times even) honestly really frustrate me... I love Mark's content but he totally ignored majority of the game and just assumed it was the games fault and not his own error...
Afton is springtrap and he is burntrap and he, is, Dead Should t it look more like burntrap??
Mark... just... mark... cmon bud... please...
''Im blue da da da de da duh da''
Interesting game, too bad it didn't make the cut, so to speak.
The junkyard is the place where all oc fan animatronics get abandoned when no one is interested in them anymore.
Honestly, watching a markiplier video is what i'd do in my free time.
Nightmare built
Me sitting  in my room having covid. watching mark Videos really helps
Thanks!
Big thank you for Marks content over all this years, there are so many vids from him that just made my day, Thanks Mark <3
Mark, you already removed the tamper locks from him. He doesn't need to die yet, you kill him in a different way.
Is the voice in the assistant device SPAMTON?! [[#1 rated salesman 1997 ]]
Yeah NGL Mark's bad experience with this game was his own fault. Didn't do any tutorials and actually try and explore the menus and stuff before playing. On his last 2 attempt he literally had the animatronic objective done but he kept doing it because he didn't check his menu.
I believe that today, March 26th, marks 10 years of this channel. Congrats Mark! Here is a cheer for next 10 years of content to come!
*AFTON*
7:05 BA DA BEE BA DA BI
This game has potential but I can see why there may have been reluctance from Scott. To reiterate, I do think this is a good game
mark kissing the animatronic animals is what caused the bite of 87 please we can't keep doing this
Foxy… It’s Back.
I hope Aftonbuild becomes a full game because I love the idea of different attractions and a person collecting animations and being kind of a super fan of the animationics collecting them and repairing them
3:48 Gotta admire Lixian’s edit here, it’s funny😂
Please do a series on this game
1 subscribe earned+
I think i see why scot shat on this game. It is horrendously made.
You know if Mark had read the tutorials he probably would've known about the line of sight thing earlier and that the cameras that he did place once but then forgot about, can also be used to assist with detonating traps.
I hope people don't go on blame Scott for not recruting the game, he probably had his reason. The game is really welldone ,there will probably be some update on it since it got the attention of many people and i'm looking forward for it! X0
This is interesting seeing these animatronics built by Afton.
“WHATS YOUR NAME” “TONY” “F**K YOU TONY”
I can't wait to see this completed though, even if it isn't accepted by scott
More like Soma than Five Nights Of Freddys, stil cool though! :D
Those damn elves can't build shit right
as much as i love the FNAF games Scott probably didn't want this to be in the Fanverse cause he was scared people might think its  better than the actual canon games themselves, But thats just a theory a GAME theory!
Game: Has tutorials and multiple objectives to achieve before even approaching the very dangerous wild animal animatronics  Mark: "I don't need your stinking tutorials!! I don't need to do anything else but rush the monsters with my stun bombs!!!"  Game: takes so much pity upon the poor stoopid man that it turns a very deadly machine into a friendly puppy  Entire Audience: is suffering from emotional damage
If anyone is wondering why the player model is blue…   Well if he was green he would die!  *DABADI BUDUBAI*  In all seriousness though this demo has good potential and I can see myself enjoying playing something like this. Obviously there are some flaws that need to be ironed out but the overall concept of Afton Built is solid
That game is soo cool
Pls MINECRAFT
Now if someone doesnt make a game called laftoni baloni i will cry
Please turn up the volume of the guy talking when you walk around exploring the area, you're lovely but a bit loud compared to the stuff in the game, I hope you don't take offense to my request I love your videos ❤️ just something I noticed, I've been watching you for YEARS thank you for everything you do for charity
I love that there's so many people defending Scott's choice of axeing Aftonbuilt when if you actually look at what he did to these guys and the stuff he put them through its absolutely horrible and not someone who actually cares about his fans. The changing contracts behind backs, demanding more and more before giving them a contract, changing the original terms; and that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's horrible.
And what did we learn today?? Thats right! DONT SKIP THE TUTORIAL!!!!!!
Mark your cam these days looks a little bit darker.
i actually can't believe at the amount of people defending this broken, shitty, messy failure of a game.
Goodness gracious me, Lixian's editing skills are insane.
*sigh* use the cameras to veiw the explosive on the scoops button mark you should be smarter then this mr."i went to engineering"
6:45 between this and security breach i think if the whole YouTube thing for kaput for mark he could do play testing for a living
Apparently, the development of this game was troubled because Scott kept screwing over the devs by promising funding, never following through and kept wasting people's time. They spent years on this and Scott threw like half of the budget that it took to develop the game at them and told them to fuck off.   Scott is a great developer, but sometimes he's a huge asshole.
So what this wierd intro about scott started copyrighting fnaf work or what?
Play fredbear's fright
Honestly Mark i don’t think Scott cares to much anymore seeing as he retired after being bullied and had his family threatened just because he didn’t vote the way some of the crazies out there wanted him to
Man it sucks this fangame didnt make it to the fanverse it looks really fun
Wait is the pizzeria in this game the location of the book Fazbear frights??
pretty sure that scott said he'd pay the devs for making this concept and he kept delaying the payment and not paying them as much as he promised he would something like that you can look it up
Fnaf fanbase never ceases to surprise me. This game is very rough and has almost nothing to do with actual fnaf lore. It's beyond a fan game, it's a game that steals characters with different plot. No wonder it was rejected.
The game wasn't rejected for being too ambitious. It was rejected for tying up the fnaf lore
This game pretty fukin spoopie ngl
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87????!!!!
Hi
Mark pls record more fnaf fangames or classic fnaf
8:47 Stranger Things season 5 leak?
Im saddened by your inability to figure out simple timing of a.i.
I still don't get how his videos get so many views. His face cam is insanely dark, his titles are lazy, his thumbnails are old style.
People are quick to call developers thieves and plagiarists the moment you use animatronics nowadays.
I remember when I first came across your channel it was the first five nights at Freddy‘s game many years ago and I remember watching you play all the other ones as they came out over the years it was so fun.
Was there a good game in this video? When did I miss it?
The thing is, it's perfectly fine to level critisism at a demo! That's the POINT! With a demo, the audience can give critisism about what can be improved upon for the full release of the game! The issue arises when the "critisism" isn't critisism, it's just nitpicky and mean spirited. There's a difference between "The control scheme is a little jank, maybe change the way some of these things work?" and "Your control scheme is dogshit therefore the game is dogshit." This game seems like it could have really used an animation to show you're hanging on to a ledge so people at least know they have the option to pull themselves up, maybe more consistant jumps, either remove fall damage or make it so a certain distance fallen enacts it, and maybe fix the bombs so rather than "line of sight" it's a distance thing + direction + certain materials block it so you COULD still make puzzles out of that  The issue is not critisism, it's giving the creator proper feedback and possible suggestions as to what could have made your experience better.
Holy fuck you need to watch the video that covers the development of this game if you haven’t already. Insane
Alright, so... Where Flumpty's 3 Mark?
10:07 at first i thought the voice actor here was markiplier, threw me for a bit of a loop
# 1 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
Watching Mark skip/skim tutorials makes me irrationally angry.
someone make sir flubs-a-lot funfair please
39:00 POV your Chica and getting love from Mark
"I'M STUPID AND I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT TUTORIAL AND LIST OF OBJECTIVES!!!" ..... "AAAAAAAAAAA GAME IS BAD AND BROKEN!!!"
Thanks Lixian for those title edits
The "sketch scenes" are just fucking awful. If I wanted to hear a *real* fire alarm for 30 seconds, I'd start playing with the _crunchy_ wiring in my apartment. And there's really nothing as pretentious as pastiche-grade OWO "quirky" cartoons.
Don't forget about wades life debt
love how mark didnt even realise he had multiple objectives and adopted foxy instead of doing them
Number 1 trending for gaming nice
35:23 sounds like tool lyrics
The junkyard is giving me Thirteenth Ghost vibes
im tony bolona hes telling me to laugh
You Can Pet The Dog in Aftonbuilt (If you're Mark)
Different.
I’m u big fan
Mark: "It's not that the controls are bad." Me: "Yeah, it's because you didn't do the tutorials."
Where was you Scott we believed in you, you was there for us once now your not here. Please come back Scott we miss you…
Hi I watched your videos for so long I love your channel  your content is amazing
So I'ma ask the question cuz I haven't seen anyone else mention it... Why WAS this game rejected from Scott's fangame program? Anyone here know?
He should finish the demo even if it isn’t part of official fan base
7:18 Ah yes, I too suffer from rice crispy knees.
Mark: "I'm Blue!" Me, mumbling: "....dabadee dabadie"
Mark you should tottaly make a video with Scott it wold be cool
Good Lord even that storyboard gives me joy
That ended surprisingly wholesome
someone make fanart of Mark and Aftonbuilt foxy frolicking through the flowers with eachother.
3:27 I grant you someone is going to make a game about that and mark is going to play it
The sad part is that this game is more playable than security breach. And it's an alpha demo. That got declined for the fanverse.
its pretty sad, waht happened to this game. goes to show that the fan verse is mostly about making money and not cool games/ideas
Now this game is markiplier certified
When markiplier was making out with a robot i laughd so much🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cool
Love the attention to detail on springtrap. During the tutorial whole he’s lying on the wall you can see a human ribcage inside it. Also makes you wonder how a literal rotting corpse has any sellable value but who am I to judge
I'd rather play this than security breach tbh.
Scott clearly has no control over the fan initiative.
@markiplier Important News: There are more and new additions to power wash simulator!
alright Lixian actually got me there at the end 😂
I love the art
Consept is cool but there is lot of bugs in demo I hope it will not be in full game. And I love mark raging 🤣
Yeah cool Video and all But wheres The Return of Stan the waterman would Love to See him again in Action  or the Rise of Skipper the skin ripper If Ur rather Into Red dead rn would be awsome  to see some rp again
I really hope that he will play one night at flumpty’s three. Those games were a golden standerd for fnaf fan games and I know he loved the first two.
per month for subscribers
realised you have 32.8 million dollars for everyone who has paid
I'm pretty sure the reason it was rejected was that it more or less idolizes Afton, or portrays Afton as being an idol to the player character.
Markiplier is the reason we need unskipable tutorials.
Always enjoy these games. Shame to hear about the denial for the fnaf verse. I'll figure it out later why not. Still wondering when that'll release.
you are so cool right now markiplier sometimes uncool but sometimes very cool your still cool regardless
Wonder if mark will figure out that the detonators can be activated if a camera is facing them and on the screen.
Hi Mark
Scott, you backed the wrong horse with security breach.
doom 3 winged beasts hell demons for freddys markiplier becuase your awsome like that
this is what popped up when I looked up asmr
Awesome
becuase your awsome for what your capable of
more dragon friday freddy videos
It was super scummy what scott did to this game tbh
#1 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
Not gonna lie, I responded to Mark saying Poochie because that’s the nickname my grandmother gave me
i need a full clean image of that thumbnail, that is wallpaper materiel
who grew up with the hallo every body my name is markiplier
Can you sing
I've literally never seen a set-and-detonate mechanic like this in a video game that requires line of sight.  It's probably for a reason.
It’s the trending #1 for me
I think honestly Mark might have needed to hold the detonator in order for it to work consistently. Also, I thought in the tutorial it said those shock bombs were supposed to be able to stun it as well.
9
A real shame Scott was too scared because of security breach. Kinda crazy and if you look up videos on this game scott had terrible communication with the team and gave them so little to work with all because he didn't wanna commit to having a game with insane potential actually go somewhere. Kinda lame tbh
This would explain how Glitchtrap got into computer chips at least
OK after this I want more games with storyboard cut scenes. I don't know why I like it but I want more of it.
I wonder if the tutorial might have helped with all the trouble nah probably not
didnt scott kinda screw this game over
someone is gonna make a fangame named "Sir Flubs-A-Lot's Funfair"
Nice
Demo...which means its more than likely going to remain a demo and never finish like so many anticipated indie games because the devs didn't realise how big the task was to make it and just dropped the project and went Dark lol
It is really sad to see how much effort went into it only for it to be thrown away because Scott abandoned it, it would have been amazing
7:05 Mark: im blue Me: dabadee dabadie
I absolutely love putting on Markiplier horror gameplay to fall asleep to. His screams soothe my soul.
Mark: "I would never shit on some one's crushed dreams!" mean while Wade: "Frick your hopes, Frick your Dreams"
This whole video annoyed me
Honestly if we could get into more of the DETAILS needed to see the transition of this games canon plot would be amazing and great for content
#1 on tending for gaming!!! Woo!!!
Hi
I think k it didn't make it cause he was making his own fundamental lore over established characters. It probably conflicts with Scott's narrative in some way. Great developer tho, good potential.
I approve of this game
play one night at flumptys *3*
petition to make a game called laftoni baloney
Wtf, i got notification
hi markiplier I love watching your videos and it's my 13th birthday on the 27th may and and I was wondering if you could say happy birthday to me thank you
The thing about Arizona was funny to me, especially since I live in Arizona. Pretty accurate with how hot it is here.
I'd want to be in Sir-Flubs-A-Lot's funfair and Laftoni Baloni's Laughapalooza
38:51 goofy ahh music
All I can think about with the Arizona location is the Grand Canyon Incident from Dayshift at Freddy's 😂
You know I always felt like if they were gonna continue FNAF without Scott, they should have removed Afton, had a protagonist studying what happened, and make the main McGuffin and purpose of the game Remnant and the things you could do with it. While Afton is still sorta there, it looks like Aftonbuilt is very close to what I was thinking! Hope it gets made some day!
Please Mark. I'm begging you to read what's on screen. I'm begging you to pay attention to more than one single thing.
as a demo this is quite wonderful, imagine if a fullgame with the issues fixed Magnificent
This game looks better than the last official FNAF mess.
One of the greatest editors in my opinion
Seeing Mark having too kuch of a hard time with the foxy guard annoyed me
kkk
I am using LaughToni Bologna as a username in the future.
“Skip past the tutorials? I think I need some tutorials…” Who are you and what have you done with Mark Fischbach?
Alright, one Laftoni Baloni’s Laffapalooza coming right up.
the concept is so cool, id love to see this polished more
Mark has a good point here devs. if you are new or you want people to play your game, make a Game with your own brand. I get it why most of starting game devs creating their 1st project to what is popular or what is being played. That is a good tactic so you can gain followers but it would be nice if you become well known with your very own game with your very own craft. Guaranteed it would be junk but at least you tried your best.
Flumpty?
He never ended up noticing that there were multiple objectives. Sadness
Harbold's Grillnasium?
This game must be something special if it got Mark to change his opinion of Foxy from "a big 'ol bag of d*cks" to "the BEST poochie!"
*Let's see how many fans of this game are here. If you like this game put Like*
What country are you watching this video from?
hi mark i just want to say the when i had a bad day your videos make my day better. i just got banned from a discord server for showing my face than everyone in that server started making fun of me so ya thank you for making content
Like Mark said. This doesn't have to be a fnaf game. It really is different enough. I also can see why Scott would pass on it.
When Mark said “My god, my hops!” (14:35), did anyone else finish it in their head with “my hops, my lovely lady hops”?
I’ve never heard of this fnaf game till now but it looks absolutely sick. Sad it was rejected. I would’ve liked to see it polished.
Loving all the longer videos lately  Under 15 minutes always feel too short and make me feel like something was missing ♥️
This demo is so cool it's a shame Scott wasn't interested in it but the work that got put into this is amazing. When foxy got stuck in stalk mode and mark was telling him what a good boi he was I got excited too lol I want a robotic dog that looks like foxy he is my favorite character across all the fnaf games
Day 3 of asking mark to stream DayZ
Whoever is the developer. They totally need to at least try to do a kickstarter, because this thing right here has insane potential. And all of the foundation is already pretty much there you only need to add and polish stuff now.
2nd comment of suggesting the game "In Sound Mind" to you Mark. really great story horror/mystery game that hasn't gotten much attention on YouTube at least and I know you'd love it
“As always there is a a flashing lights, loud noises, and jump-scare warning.”  But enough about Mark, what are the warnings for the game?
You should play apeirophobia on roblox it’s such a high quality game and I really wanna see your reaction to it
#1 trending rn congrats mark
its so hard to seeeeee
"I’m playing the physical embodiment of crushed dreams" WOW, GEEZ, BLUNT. I felt that pain in my soul and I've never even heard of this game before.
YOOO THIS HAS POTENTIAL TO BE SECURITY BREACH's PREQUEL WHY DIDN'T SCOTT MAKE THIS OFFICIAL
31:10 Mat Pat have found that bug too and there are 2 ways to recover from that bug 1. Die or 2. Restart. And how to get that very bad bug is to fail once on one of the 6 spring locks things in any number before 6 is doom.
Mark you should absolutely do another playthrough of Alien: Isolation!!
I know scott said this was a “risk”, I assume since the other fanverse games already had a community built around them, but I mean holy shit the potential here is INSANE how could he not want to give these devs a shot? It’s so disappointing knowing the devs have (I think) now pulled the plug on this since scott wasn’t interested. The Joy Of Creation was a massive gameplay leap & look how amazing that turned out. Just a shame everything here is going to waste
PARKOUR! 😂
Rip
I' am losing my "confidence" मै इतना मेहनत करता हूँ "गेमिंग" विडियो पर लेकिन कोई छोटे यूट्यूबर को सपोर्ट नहीं करता सब स्टार को करते हैं बस 😭😞❤,
All of the budget went to the game, I can't blame them
Rip Lixian in the 17 minute mark :v
i definitely think if they were able to have enough time to rebrand, this could easily work as a unique sci-fi horror game, the fnaf animatronics could easily be replaced with more conventional robots and they could still use the plotline of a corrupt, evil business person who is stuck inside the body/ mind of a machine with a science fiction horror story much more easily; they could very much turn the fnaf shell into a very unique and inspired story that could even distance itself from fnaf but retaining parts of the story that they feel is necessary for the aesthetic and/or worldbuilding, there is a lot of potential in the gameplay as well if refined/ elaborated more as well! i hope and can't wait to see if there will be more for this game, they have a great idea and great foundation, they don't need fnaf or scott cawthon to carry it!
I can't believe he didn't know that was the scoop fom Sister location
Scott after leading the creators on and wasting their time and money only to deny them:
More FNAF fan games plz!!!
Oh yay, now even more ignorant children will be exposed to this game and the drama surrounding it and scream about how Scott Cawthon is a terrible person because he rejected a massive failure in the making with more red flags than the CCP.
YouTube compression had a field day with this one
yea
someone out there is gonna make a game called laugh toni baloneys now
Mark  should play the Chilla art closing shift
The creators/devs of AftonBuilt should just adjust it and make their own thing for sure. This is really awesome.  Edit: 2.5k likes proves my point that lots of people wanna see this... rebuilt, if you will. I hope that with Markiplier playing it for his audience that maybe they resurge with their own creation.  Peace and Blessings, everyone. And thanks for the likes.
17:07 JUNKYAAAAAAAAAARD IF YOU WANT TO FIND COOL VIDEOOOOOSSSS
20:26 took him a sec to realize death's swift approach
Hey mark Since you talked about it in this ep I making a video game currently called DRAKO do you think you can play a demo when I make it
i love that mark played this but i also wanted him to *read. lol kicking a dead dog when its down and not knowing the objectives lol i love you mark. "I keep bugging itttt!" dude. XD
it is ashamed that a game like this didn't get to see the light of day
At The beginning I thought my fire alarm was going off but it was the video
Honestly if you did some more of the tutorial the experience would’ve probably been a bit better. Shame this wasn’t funded :(
"I don't think Sc*tt C*wthon would like that".  Who cares what he likes? He's an out and loud Tr*mp supporter which is dangerous to the LGBTQ+ community who makes up the largest portion of his fanbase soooooo. I could really not care less what he does and doesn't like.  Scott's Tots for the win.
Ah yes, Mark casually EMPs the junkyard fox enough to where it believes he's on the whitelist to do whatever the hell he's doing in a junk yard till he gives it the experience of being a deer in headlights and remembers "Wait, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU GET OUTTA HERE"
Mark needa build his own game he’d be great with his fun ideas
If Lyxian doesnt make a Laftoni Baloni game now i will be so sad.
Didn't Scott retire after being outed as an anti-LGBT Evangelical? Why's he making a...fanverse(?) game?
I laughed at "Laugh Tony-Balogna's Laughapalooza"
Hulu made a short film called The Hug and it features a restaurant called Pandory’s Pan Pizza Palace it has a similar vibe to FNAF and it’s quite good. Mark talking about having similar ideas to FNAF but changing the name reminded me of it.
*HAAAAAAANK!!!*
Still looks better than Security Breach
Shame this wasn’t able to become a full game, but I’m glad Mark is happy to play it. It’s got potential!
This is so dark.
Fun fact as a youngster I was called Tony macaroni and Tony baloney😂
6:53 The Kiss of 87'
I actualy have a game in mind but i dont know how to build it. The game Would be that you start at your home then you need something out in the wood then the Woods Will just loop forever
7:05 da boo dee da boo dye
Markiplier made something fnaf related, …aaaannnnd it’s #1 on trending. A true testament to the god that is our man Mark
Can we just appreciate this is currently #1 on trending for gaming!
A basic bug log of every bug mark encountered: inconsistent fall damage, inconsistent button reads, body blocking doggo (unless this is intentional), and friendly mode on the doggo. If this game were to be finished it would be a great game, considering the movement already feels like mirrors edge, I would buy this if it got finished as a animatronic "fazmaphobia" XD
Commenting on Mark's video hoping hell find the one I left on the Hold On ending, and because thank you for helping me sleep at night.
so this games contraversy is interesting, according to what i found the devs put multiple years of work into this game demo just to make it good enough for a private pitch to scott, (which is why the demo is so buggy it was only ment as a proof of concept. Scott ended up still saying no and years of work went for nothing so yeah the devs took it hard. *points to previous comment* yeah that thing about game design... this is one of the ways it can bite you in the rear, need to have tough skin so you can take the disapointments that often come with it.... also fan games should be kept short for a reason... plan on doing it for free and if the game gets accepted into the fanverse great. but if it isnt ur not out countless hours of work for nothing to show for it. Fan games can be a fun way to try game design but i wouldnt bank making money off a fnaf fan made.
Right off the bat, the storyboard-style cutscenes remind me of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker's animated comic cutscenes, and I'm all about it.
Loss of hand is worth petting the possessed fox
Hey Mark, speaking for the future watchers of this....  ...there's like....3 other goals to finish after getting Foxy's coding stuff done  sincerely,  yours and our sanity  ps. Foxy is a good boi
They seem like they couldn't hire an actual animator or they were an animator as well and just didn't have the time to actually animate the cut scenes
What about crushed dreams?  I missed something
trending #1, i love you sm
11:33
30:00
Game: "Remement" Me: "LOOORE LOOOOREEE"               Mark said that over the time of playing security breach just saying LORRRREEEE
it would be absolutely amazing if there was a full game made of this, it looks stunning already but it could be even better
I've been waiting for mark to play this because I want to see his perspective of the game
7:06 my brain: DONT SAY IT DONT SAY IT DONT SAY IT
from the name of the game i legit expected a build your animatronic type of game and you can play with them
This concept seems really dope for a game! I’d love to see the finished product if the developer ever returns to it
Lixian out here doing the absolute MOST with the title screen gags
EYO?!?! This is that gamw!
#1 On Trending For Gaming, congrats Mark ❤️
That was a good poochy right there
I’ve never seen someone say “ now who’s a good boy “ to a dog then right after that say “ now gimme ur insides. “ until this day
#1
Who else gets frustrated at Mark not playing the tutorials but also excited to see how he comes up with a way to play it by exploiting the mechanics and not discovering the entire game???
No because how did he miss the other objectives that pop up when he opens that wheel of tools. You'd think he'd notice that, no? Mark you were a little too hyper-focused.
Marks videos never fail to cheer me up:) my sis got covid right before vacation and I’ve been stressed as heck and I’ve been binging ur vids to cheer me up. Keep up the amazing content man <3
16:34 My ears
its very obvious as to why this game was rejected lol
I like how mark encouraged people to create games not just about fnaf but original ip’s that they make theme selves, love to see content creators supporting other creators
Ok i got an idea how about nutball tournament?   i just remembered unus annus nutball game
Guys I’m not gonna explain the whole drama but it wasn’t “too big of a risk for Scott” that’s being BEYOND generous considering what happened. It was more that Scott has no clue how to make decisions and doesn’t realize people won’t just keep working while he leads them on for years
Video 134 of asking Mark to play the Mata Nui Online Game
1:04 - 3:04 the most intense cutscene ever
Those charector designs are just abosultey amazing
Befriended the Foxy dog, can die happy now :3
This entire video had me absolutely enraged
why was it taken down
hell yeah
You cant spell Afton without Lafton Baloni
time to go make a game named sir flubsalot funfair
*Do you want to take the tutorials for the tools* Mark: "Psssh naah" Also Mark: "WHY DOESN'T THIS THING WORK? WHAT AM I DOING WRONG"
I like the concept of changing the title lol, I think that's not a bad idea for any games. Having this mechanic in a title would make the game interesting and fun imo
the voice sounds like mark...
I don't watch your videos as much as I did a few years ago, life goes on and things change ect. But as we all go through hard times in our lives I always find my way back here when it seems the worst. I'm glad you are still here after all this time making videos for all of us and I just want to say thank you Mark, I'd love to meet you one day.
WHOOO MARKIPLIER HAS POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY!! 15 FINALLY. ILY MR. MARKIPLIER
I already knew there was going to be a jumpscare but you managed to scare the shit of me. And y- WAIT IS THAT HANK FROM MADNESS COMBAT?
How about Wilfred's pizza palace
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
2 weeks at Markiplier's. Truly a horrifying game
No wonder it was rejected
"I don't wanna be too hard on it cause I'm playing the physical embodiment of crushed dreams"
Afton: hello- HELLO? ad: hello there! Me: WTF
Markipler I don’t know if you have played this yet but The Backrooms 1998 is a great horror survival game. Would recommend checking it out
7:03 "o h.... I'm blue 😏"
this is like hello neighbor but FNAF style
Where’s *Amy* ?
Man sad this game didn't get accepted or whatever actually happened (i don't know). I love the idea for the story, and i really like the guard-dog Foxy model. The idea of the Afton company re-using the animatronics for whatever they need is pretty great and having Afton as an actual character that pretends to be "just a guy" is pretty interesting ngl. Aside from some controls and animations glitching this game seems pretty good, would love to see it finished ! I'm wondering how Mark didn't realize that Freddy carcass is the same one that is on FNAF 3, just on the side of the main office....you see it 90% of the time while in that game huehue
Daily reminder: You're not useless. You're not a dissapointment. You're not dumb. You're not different. You're not compared to anyone. Because... You're loved. You're strong. You're smart. You're beautiful inside and out. You're the best version of YOU there ever is. and you're human. I know you're going through a lot of stuff right now but it'll be okay. This life is a long journey. In a journey, there are ups and downs. If you ever go down, it doesn't mean you can't go back up. Rest easy and give yourself a treat :) I love you very very much and I just want you to know that.💕And when you go back up, you have that space in your heart that can help others back up, as well
Jeff’s pizzeria 😏
Not only did he skip the tutorials and acknowledge that he might be confused because of skipping the tutorials and then figure out on top of that that the bombs may be activated by line of sight, he continues to repeatedly break line of sight.  Incredible.
Mark will tame anything as long as it's a dog 🤣
That opening cutscene was pretty good, considering it was just a storyboard. The pacing and music took it up a notch.
Why does the beginning person look like Hank J. Wimbleton
Great concept love the idea of the game but man does it need a lot more polish. Give it like a year of polish some animation tweaks and such. And I'd pay 60$ for it.
FINALLY! I’ve been waiting to watch anything about this until The King of Fnaf put his lay down on it!
Love how the pda guy talks like Spamton
I might play that
i'd love to see Mark play Five Nights at the Krusty Krab 3 or one night at Flumpty's 3
10 seconds left ebefor emy bday
I absolutely love the animatics, the ideas behind the game is amazing, the dog foxy is kinda cute and just… I want to see this complete…
Looks like FNAF to me
My uncle always wakes up to one of your videos even tho he dislikes them for some reason
1 minute before mybirthday
Drippy is reborn!
28:27 best part
Thanks for another amazing video men, i Am very interesting in this Type of video
For some reason, this reminded me of "SOMA".
38:51 Every fnaf fan's dream come true XD
What
I love Mark, I really do, but watching him aimlessly wander in these types of games makes me very nervous and I don't know why
YAY i thought the video was made 7 years ago
lafftonie's laughappaloosa would make a great game
I reallly enjoyed this game, both Mark's and Matpat's playthroughs showed the effort and care that went into it. The developers should definitely be proud!
Fps I Am Bread
For goodness' sake, Mark, you still needed to get into the one room and close the water things. I'd be very happy to see you finish the game, as it's pretty interesting!
huh
The amount of times I watched in space pt 1 and 2 is insane and everytime he brings it up I want to watch it again, Damnnnn youuu Markkkkkkkkkkk.
2:25 made me check if i left my microwave open
My favorite part of this video is the rat in the beginning that said "sneef" and I will not accept any proposals that any other part was better
markiplier is always #1 on trending for gaming
Ya know the hours of listening to game theory and the fnaf lore theories some of the information actually made sense to me in terms of what they were saying in the game.
the subtle asmr at 13:10
as someone who's never been a fan of FNAF, i love the look of this game and would love to play.
At 9:05 it sounds like the beginning to role model by Eminem.  I have no idea how I happened to remember that but it low key sounds like it
NGL this demo is infuriating to play. the LOS mechanic for the bombs is antiquated, seems like something from a mid 2000's game. It feels like the Dev was trying to mash Mirror's Edge style locomotion with outlast vibes, and then just decided 'fuggit, throw in gadgets because why not.'  4/10 uninstalled after dying to the foxy dog 3 times because of shit controls.  This 'game' trash. Should have been abandoned like the animatronics in it. Pile O' Poopy
I think the main reason this never got into the fanverse was because it was too much of its own thing. Who knows?
You call it "Pooh Bear's Honey Parlor" wait, still Disney
shout out to laf tony bulony
I'm used to jumpscares but with Mark i just don't know what to expect, i don't know what's gonna happen and when, i honestly jumped with two jumpscares from editing and oh lord, why did those get me and how?!
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING 🎉
hey mark little back story here kinda so your an employee of afton mechanics and salvage you salvage and repair animatronics there just wanyed to know from a dedicated subscriber
These graphics are fkn BEAUTIFUL
the porson you took is spring trap and his son took him
20:15 Mark: *closes the valve* I don't know why I need to do that--   *foxy comes running towards him at the distance*   Mark: OH OH OHHHMYGOD WHYYYAAAAAAAAAAAA---
I love the whole concept of remnant from the books!
Not markiplier needing tutorials
You seem pretty smart  Mark: proceeds to jump onto a porta potty and look at his hands
cogats on #1 on trending
7:05 Dabadee dabadoo
like ive stated in vrchat: "uncrustable foxy"
#1 on gaming, Mark always popping off on fnaf videos
fuck scott for not doing this game thats why security breach was ass
:o
Please play the campaign of titanfall 2
Lyxian I really appretiate the work you put into this channel, Thank You :)
❤❤❤❤❤
Wow I'm the 1.1 millionth view what an honor   Also can't wait to see a game featuring Laftoni Baloni
I love In Space with Markiplier but I'm also just so happy Mark's back with the videos. <3
Have fun with your new dog Mark, you earned it.
more fnaf content by the king of fnaf
Does mark reply?
The map labels Louisiana as Mississippi and I cannot unsee it lol. I’m like “oh I’m from Mississippi- wait that’s not Mississippi…”
Hmm it makes sense why they trying to sell it to scott cawton. The game making its own story in fnaf and its similar to fnaf sister location and fnaf security breach. It might be on sequel and prequel
Hi
Great job on mark in space !
41:35
Mark cannot, but i can, this is bad game. No fun or at least scare, just graphics. Many things need redisign
Someone make Laftoni Baloni, NOW!!!
i hope when this game does get continued it would let you have a gigantic robo pet dog
Why are justifying lying? If the game is shit then it’s shit and the developer definitely needs to fix those problems if they want the game to be great. If you want to improve you have to be honest first and then you can fix it otherwise you will be a dog inside of a burning house and tell yourself “this is fine.”
Bravo lixian that’s jumpscare almost gave me a heart attack 10/10
Ritalin
LAFTINIBALONI
I really hope they can fix up what they have right now at least and then try to finish the game. It'd be so cool!
Mark I am gonna die stop making me laugh
still waiting for mark to play one night a flumptys 3
7:05 "da ba dee da ba die." 🤣
“Unless you have some dynamite or highly explosive weaponry-“  Me immediately: TEXAS
First we got a heist with markiplier, then we got markiplier in space, next is beastiality with markiplier  6:40
It is just me who thought the title was "Aftonbutt" for a good few seconds?
Damn that game was so scary had me shook and tearing
Hi
I get that this would be a cool concept for a stand-alone game instead of a fangame but also why would you complain about someone making a fan game? Like 1.) funding and 2.) maybe they didn’t want to make an original game? Maybe they really like FNAF and wanted to make something for it? Don’t complain about the devs making fangames when it’s probably something they were really proud of making
Aftonbuilt.
Is mark the voice cause it sounds like him
7 hours after being posted and still #1 trending for gaming. I love that I started watching him in 3rd grade
Mantap bro & sukses terus bro 👍😁 Dan teman-teman boleh mampir di channel youtubeku ada game2 menarik lainnya gaes 👍👍😁
can we talk about lixian's amazing editing skills? Every video i see of markiplier misspronouncing something he is reading or something like that, lixian changes the words so seemlessly it looks like part of the game. good job lixian!
IT'S A DEMO OF CRUSHED DREAMS
#1 ON TRENDING FOR FNAF GAMING!
COOL, number one trending for gaming, great job mark!!
Hxh is backkk !!!
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Somone should make their own security breach if that’s possible because that game was a let down
i kid you not, they stole springtrap
definitely should've called the game fat on built, or built on fat
22:43 “You world never punch a man with glasses would you?!”  Flashback to The Creatures..!  I don’t know whether Mark saying this was an unintentional reference, but sure did my heart jump when I heard him say that
Recording: you must be very smart  Mark: *climbing on top of a porta potty*
This could literally just be a parkour simulator and I would pay to play it
THE SCOOPER 👁👄👁
The phone guy voice sounds a lot like Mark and thus I thought Mark is playing this because he voiced in it.
Man, I would trust Afton just based on his voice. He seems like such a standup guy
why is it cute
We back in mf business
I can see some potential in the concept, but it needs some serious refining. I agree though, this could be it's own standalone thing. It doesn't have to necessarily be a Fnaf spinoff because the gameplay is so drastically different.
no cause at end of video I realize how cute was foxy was but the edited really got me jump scare .
rip mark, this game is full of lore he has yet to understand 😭
Mark when are you gonna finish that dating sim???
markiplier forgetting that people may just want their game to use fnaf content because they like fnaf? I feel like that's a pretty normal consideration that somehow went over his head.
i feel like something ppl should keep in mind is that from my knowledge this is barely even a demo it's more a proof of concept and tech demo 😭ofc it's really buggy it's just supposed to get across the ideas they want to include in the full game this was made, initially, just for scott to see. mark also didn't look at any of the tutorials which i feel are necessary when the game isn't progressively giving you the tools like intended. ofc that makes for a funnier video but yeah i do appreciate mark restraining so much tho lmao. also for anyone curious i believe unfortunately this game is abandoned bc it's too much money for them to invest for no profit (scott's orders) but if you like the ideas here check out the team i believe they still want to do game development just not fnaf.
That pocket fm ad was too good😭😭😭 watched the whole two minutes
Mark, could you please try playing "In Sound Mind"
35:30 maybe see the tutorial, no? only me? ok
Fun facts mark, mickey mouse is soon finally becoming public domain, meaning you can indeed make a mickey fangame legally so long as you don't use any other Disney trademarks
I want more
The rearrangement of the title should be a meme
38:50 - never expected this honestly
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh why is this #1 on trending for gaming
Maybe one day he'll read the objectives that pop up on screen and figure out he finished removing the tamper locks already and could move onto the next onjective.  It was also just hilarious to watch, though.
Doggo foxy is so fn cute!
That panel looking like something straight out of stranger things
Hey markipoo, since u didn't know u were suppossed to go up and finish it off after hacking it which you would know if you cant hack it anymore
This game is great sad they didn't get the light they deserved
Hi Markplier I have an idea for your next video it would be cool if you played cooking companions! It’s such a cool game! It’s a dating sim Four friends gather in a cabin located in the Tatras Mountains, which the player character owns: sweet Mariah, prickly Karin, shy Anatoly, and friendly Gregor. It seems that they are on vacation in the mountains, preparing to rough it out. The player character hosts them, cooking every night. It’s a cute game with a sinister background a psychological horror dating sim. I would be thrilled if you saw this and played the game. They’re 7 endings to unlock and many secrets to reveal!
tbh this game might even be better if they made the original story. Instead of knowing that the guy you're helping is evil you could have that realization slowly build as you discover his horrible old experiments. It could give it a lot of suspense
what Security Breach should've been
OK, everything except the removal of the tamper locks seems fine. Unfortunately, the removal of the tamper locks is one of the main mechanics of the game, and having that as the biggest apparent flaw is likely part of why this is just a demo.
Mark: *Walks to the point where the bomb goes out of view* Also mark: *Blames the controls*
•
27:27 when u walk in on ur parents
I hate that so many youtubers skip tutorials, then get mad when they can't perform the actions the tutorials would've told them.
Okay this would be a crazy throw back ☝🏻. But who here wants Markiplier to do a play through of AGE OF WAR. I think this would be a good nostalgic game for everyone to enjoy and reminisce while watching mark play
Markiplier-"Make me funny!!"😁 God-"Sorry, I only do Miracles, buuuuut...that's IMPOSSIBLE Mark!"🤨
I wonder if the current owner of Fazbear's entertainment owns Candys and popgoes too.
there was literally a menu of things to do top left side.. also informed how many times you need to scoop foxy.  its kinda funny watching mark playing completely different way from MatPat, also not having any clue about what was going on, MatPat from other way was enjoying every little bit of "eastereggs" and lore that there was (golden freddy, other bonny that actually was the final part of the demo). Also having waaaay much more trouble scooping foxy the "right way" using the flashlights to stun in front of the scooper.  also Mark, if you press E you win. hahaha   also also, probably this project was rejected because kinda anuls everything about Glitchtrap and Vanny that probably was already in development... ...also Security Breach. Imagine a greenlight fangame be so much better than an "original" company one.
I think one of the main reasons this game didn't make it is because of the junky, decrepit rundown feel. Security Breach has a lot of bright and cheery and colorful stuff you can make merchandise off of.
i really hope the writers find a developer who’s willing to help complete the game cuz there’s truly so much potential with it
afton was british tho wasnt he ??
CAN YOU DO BIGFOOT AGAIN PLZ
Hy Markiplier play one night at flumpty's 3
You should return to case animatronics
I see he brought back the thumbnail background he used for his fnaf series
Um is mark voicing afton or not? It sounds very similar if not.
38:55-39:37 I could imagine someone animating those parts
Not a fan of the charismatic Afton the way he's portrayed in the actual games makes him alot more threatening and I dont think a crazy murderer would 100 percent be chill with being in some random dudes ipad even if it got him out of the suit
People make games like this attached to a successful intellectual property because they require clout. Without clout it's very hard to just go to a studio and be like 'take my created thing with zero experience to show how good I am at making games'. Making a successful fan game gives them the experience and portfolio to get taken in by someone big to finance their own original creation.
I've watched 10 minutes and i'm locked in.  I have always loved mark playing FNAF, especially fan games such as Joy Of Creation.  This ones a good one.  Absolutely love it.
17:04...Mark slowly becoming a Tech-priest from WH40K.

Hola
Hoal
0:08 wait there was a jumpscare there? Sorry I didn’t notice because I’m numb to them due to your *fucking* Fnaf 4 videos (which were awesome by the way they’re probably some of my favorite YouTube videos)
I'm sorry, I'm just kinda stuck on the opening thing, like Mark saying it doesn't have to be Freddy's. I could be something like... Tucan's Terror or something.
Hey I found this game I think you’ll like and I’d love to see you play it, it’s called deliver us the moon. It’s a space game I think you’ll enjoy it :)
Lixian’s editing is god tier. I couldn’t stop laughing when Mark was trying to make a new name for AftonBuilt and the actual name kept changing.
what game
Woah mark is posting once again hmmm there is something is up either he just enjoys posting and he has free time or me might not post for along time soon?
This is what Security Breach should have been
I thought there would be more people talking about how he ignored the tutorials, got angry that the mechanics didn’t make sense to him, then ignored the rest of the objectives when he finished the locks and continued to do the scooper thing which got him killed… twice. Then proceeded to be mad at the game instead of using what was offered to him.
It’s a boring game. Enough said. Glad it didn’t make it. The better ones did.
Not being able to cheat the system by doing it over and over in one spot. And not being able to activate it unless you're in line of sight. I don't see how this is the developer's problem if people can't figure it out. Even ignoring the instructions on purpose to increase the number of freak-outs shouldn't make this difficult. The game has bugs, but these are not them.
17:05 - Mark has been hiding the fact that he's a vocaloid all this time 😔
I guess this is a bad time to tell Mark he probably should've paid more attention to the tutorial. There's more to it than scooping Foxy.
Such a shame that Scott was such an asshole to the poor devs.
Just speculation on my part but I think if this was released as an "official" unofficial FNAF game it would jack with the already messy continuity this series has. It comes off as a "this is how Afton came to be like this now" and I think Scott wanted to keep the mystery just a bit longer.  But I guess we'll never know since he quit due to everyone collectively losing their shit on him.  Unless he's come back and I missed that lol
Demo Dog, is that you?
Now someone is going to make a game called "Sir Flubs-A-Lot's FUNFAIR" just because Mark suggested it.  He is becoming too powerful to be left alive...
POV: girls on their periods: 17:53
Markipliers the interface not working because it probably needs recalibrated. At the top of the screen where “MvRT” is there’s also a “recalibration” tab.
Day 1 of asking mark to play little nightmares 2 🙏☹️
I feel like people make FNAF fan games because they need at least some way to make their hard work visible to the public. FNAF has a big following, trendy, easy to recognize. If your game is similar to FNAF in some ways but isn’t marketed as a fangame, who’s gonna give a shit?
Markiplier comforts me so much <333
Thought the title was “Aftonbutt”, slightly disappointed but it’s ok
4:00  The dumb sh¡t Lix has to edit. 🤣
im so use to the editing style on this channel that the jumpscares dont get me anymore
Mark doesnt seem to realize that Scott himself is paying the people who are making the "FNAF Fan-verse"
yyaayyy
38:44 I love how mark treats the thing that killed his several times like it’s his best friend dog
Congrats hitting #1 on trending
to be really fair this IS a proof of concept demo so i was already expecting things to be not so good. it does accomplish showing, you know, a proof of concept! and honestly i am already endeared to 'goggles guy', even though i question why he's freaking helping a serial killer. hopefully the dev is able to continue work on this game somehow, or makes their own original game!
Anyone else getting this weird urge to watch In Space With Markiplier?  Or listen to an episode of Distractible?  ... Weird.

#1 trending gaming NICE
A million views in multiple hours. Only markiplier can do that.
Sir Flubsalot Funfair game when?
Somebody contact the dev, because Mark is right!
Let’s he just hope goes through the f’ing tutorials next time
Game literally shows Mark he has to be looking at the explosive and clicking to trigger it.    Mark: " THIS IS STUPID! YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE! "
Would it really be a fnaf spin off game if Mark didn't complain and rage? 😅  I think I could've had potential. Too bad..
I don't think mark realized you probably need to flood the trench to finish him off
Scotts tops
This game shouldn't have been published in this state.
1# on trending for gaming. darn
Mark: I'm blue Me: dabudidabudai
The tutorial: here is how you play the game  Mark: nah  Mark: why's the game so hard
Genuinely just yelled at Mark to shut up during one of the cutscenes
7:05 Da ba dee da ba dow
There will be a game called “Lauftoni Baloni” now, mark my words.
Fan game that is a lot better and makes more sense than FNAF SB
Aftonbuilt had so much potential
Is there a part two
steven said he will paly it too
1# ON TRENDING????????
Doggo Foxy is a good boy that just needs boops and cuddles and I'm very much okay with that.
Shoutouts to Jacob the Loofah
ngl, I would genuinely join a fandom for a game like this 👀 especially if it becomes its own thing separated from FNaF (either way though - love it)
Have you ever think that about in a minute u get 1m views already and u like HOW DID THEY GET HERE ALREADY HOW DID TJEY KNOW?!?!?!? Huhhh???!!!
That Scott's totts reference to the office was great
Everybody here making jokes about how Mark is trying so hard to not shit on the game. Remember that he didn’t even play the tutorial; he did this to himself. It’s not as hard if you use all the tools accessible to yourself (for example the floodlights are a huuuuge help). But the bugs that did occur are legitimate problems that im not blaming Mark for
40:04 that's loss
The Character Looks like Deadpool am I Right Guys
It's literally Fnaf security breach. Since you were breaching security. In a Fnaf game.
This is my headcannon now. Nothing explains how william got out of a fucking fire and escaped without anyone noticing.
mark, when will you play one night at flumptys 3
Lmao the cutscene is better than Security Breach's 😭
17:45
Needing line of sight is one of those things where the developers put extra time and effort into making the game less responsive, clunky, and ultimately worse.
This game has so much potential I genuinely don't understand how Scott rejected this!
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A FIRE IN MY HOUSE
Mark, can you play The Man In The Window? Hope you play it for reason.
yeah i heard about this game a few months ago, apparently there was a LOT of unspecific direction with the game, Scott was constantly unavailable to contact, the development team kept getting goals set up only for the goalposts to be moved when they got close, they were waiting on funding, and in the end scott chose the games that would bring more merchandise than games with a good gameplay concept
You should play more deep rock galactic its gotten a lot more updates recently
AftonScott
1:56 PLEASE someone tell me I'm not the only one who thinks these two are Mark and Jack!
22:40 nice Creature Hub reference mark lol
Lets be honest, if Labour unions existed in the FNAF universe, the Freddy Frasbear franchise would have gone into liquidation because of all of the lawsuits and strikes.
Damn this rubbish looks really clunky, nice visuals and poor gameplay never works.
I'm more entertained by markipliers dialog and commentary than anything else
i want to play laftoni balony game
I’m going to assume that you couldn’t jump because you were injured. You’re welcome. 😉
Mark is a sweetheart.
haha these jumpscares cant scare me if i am staring way past the screen
For the reason why this game was rejected by Scott: After the failure that it Security Breach, Scott now fears of investing in a highly ambitious project only for it to suffer the same fate as SB. It is quite unfortunate, but Scott needs to realize that Aftonbuilt offers what we FNAF fans actually want, a FNAF game that captures the horror the original FNAF games have. Although the game's rejected, I hope everyone can give this game a try and somehow change Scott's mindset. The game's quite a trippy adventure, too.
7:05  Mark: I'm Blue  Me:  Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di
Correct me if I'm wrong (I haven't looked into it nor have I finished the video) but was this game rejected because of the Afton personality? Don't get me wrong, I'm really liking what I'm seeing with this game and while I think this personality works great with this game so far I am incertain if it stays faithful to the monster that the fnaf games show Afton to be.
Lmao.  Now I wanna see fan concept art of this game but for a story revolving around “Laf Toni Baloni’s Lafapalooza”
Still waiting for Mark to play one night's at flumpty's 3 ;(
peepaw origin story
Yeah, the monster definitely blocks your line of sight.
This game could be super awesome without the FNAF stuff
Developer of this, I dare you to finish the game under the name LAFTONI BALONI...
It feels like Soma meets Five Nights a bit....
You should play Tyke and Sons Lumber Co. Don't look into it before hand, all you need to know is that it's a fangame based on Chipper and Sons Lumber Co, the precursor to FNAF. I think Dawko played it in 2019 but ive seen a lot more attention put onto it recently. Also, love him but he's a loud boy and I want the only sometimes screamy Mark to play it. Lol.
Fuck this game is so good and it makes me so angry that the people in charge basically jerked them around until telling them "nahhhhh not good enough."
Markkkk you gotta play below zero and DOOM TAG🙏🙏😬
i like how he bite him i the end for flashing the light in his face then afterward was nice again
YES! FINALLY I CAN BE TEAM SPRINGTRAP
Nice to see Mark start to lose it over a game, I miss his freakouts
It is very painful seeing mark not get how he needs to do more than stun the animatronic to win
Don't really get any of the people saying this fan game had "potential." This looks like a mediocre concept that was never even finished.
look at that #1 on tranding
very good

In the beginning cutscene he was grabbing springtrap afton just btw
The game does have a lot of potential, but..the bugs in the game should've been fixed before releasing it. The bugs is what ruin the game in a way. Same with Security Breach, except they make you run around in Security Breach, and you have no idea on where to get most of the stuff that's in the game, plus there's no good reason for the main character to actually do anything, but the character takes part in destroying each character in Security Breach.  The areas in Security Breach are just too big, and by the time you get halfway in the game?  You're just ready to get it finished, and stop being careful as well. The main quest for the game? Could've been better, and the areas could've been a bit smaller in Security Breach. Both games have flaws, but do have a lot of potential.
This game could have been great so it’s a shame Scott didn’t accept it but I can see why he didn’t
One Night At Flumpty’s 3
it was rejected because Scott wanted a small five nights at Freddy's game not a full on 3d story built game you probably a know what I mean but that's part of it
I really like how the eyes on the iPad thing were animated to go along with Afton's dialogue
Sensible mark: "maybe i shouldve done the tutorial" other mark right after: "NAH IT'S FINE I KNOW WHAT IM DOING"

Alright now who’s going to make a game called Laftoni Baloni’s Laughapalooza? 😂
Whoever did the editing of the title during Mark’s manic rant deserves the world, that was stellar.
Watching this drunk is less scary 🥴

JUNKARD!!
“I’m playing the physical embodiment of crushed dreams, and the last thing I want to do is kick the developer when they’re down”  Holy shit Mark I think you kinda already did…
still thinking about how mark hasn’t finished 100% of sucker for love😀

The reason you couldn’t jump in the beginning was because you fell and hurt your leg.
Bro I thought the letters were actually moving in the game 😭😭
Okay,  I can't be the only one that appreciated soooo much the editing of the laftoni baloni. SOO clean. amazing vid
oh hi mark 🍀
HOLY SHIT IS THAT LAUGHTONI BOLOGNA??????
I really enjoyed how much was put into this game. Even the little audio things like wind whooshing when falling/jumping long distances. And thankfully it was generous with the hitbox. This has so much potential.
Still Less glitchy than security breach lmao 🤣
Lafony Balony
five night freddy is this where you want to be five night freddy
Mark really did not want to complete the level, he really liked bullying foxy.
I love my name 🤣
the animatronic blocks line of sight
sneef
Can't wait to play sir-flubs-a-lots funfair
Play ONAF 3
Im guessing the reason Scott rejected this game was because its too much implicated in the fnaf lore, and Aftons transformation into Springtrap might be something he wants to explore more in his own work, which could cause contradictions down the line if this game were accepted. Just my though process anyway
Watch distractable
The thing is... if someone puts out hot garbage, sometimes they need to know its bad so they can make it better. You're only a bastard for pointing it out if: A) your criticism isn't constructive and B) your criticism is overly aggressive.   If a creator cannot take criticism, they shouldn't post.  Besides, if your goal was to pretend like you like the game... well your true feelings are more than obvious.   That being said, my critique is as follows (If the developers somehow come across this comment): The game has an interesting concept and clearly has had a lot of work put into it. Especially graphically (but I'm no expert in spotting premade assets, so idk).  The biggest drawback is the controls. Second biggest drawback is the AI and game balance. So controls: They need to respond consistently. That is a must. Frankly character movement and interacting with the interface should be pretty solid if you plan to release a demo since, ya know... its what lets you progress through the game. The AI isn't as big of a deal, but its still important. If the monster can't find you when you stand in front of it, that removes the horror. The horror also disappears when escaping the monster is frustrating instead of exhilarating. If defeating the dogbot is important to completing the mission, it needs to be a little more obvious because I didn't pick up on that from this since dogbot never actually went down. Maybe that's because Mark doesn't read tutorials, maybe it was because Mark's webcam covered the current objective. Also the dogbot really shouldn't require more than one interaction. The guy over the radio said to utilize the environment to put the animatronics down for good. A voice line from the protag would be helpful in pointing that out to the player. The robotic arms only hold the dogbot down for a time and the... device... doesn't seem to do much of anything to it. So, in my mind... the way to improve this is to have you run around the junkyard turning on power boxes while evading the dogbot. This emphasizes the threat and gives the player reason to avoid it. Then, the player should have a way to lure the dogbot under a magnetic crane to immobilize it. Retrieve the items from the bot while it can't attack you. Use the crane controls to drop it into a crusher. Boom. you only have to directly interact with the robot once, you give the environment a reason to exist, you prioritize evading the monster to make it more exciting, all in all a better experience by removing some of the tedious gameplay. Also that robot needs to slow sometimes. Make it fast on straightaways and slower to turn. Bob and weave and give the player a dodge roll or something. If he has the 'mad hops' to clear a 30 foot gap, I think he can manage to avoid a charging animatronic. Chase and bite and chase and bite makes for a boring monster. If the game wants to make a point of confronting the animatronics, they need to be interesting to face head to head. Basically, if you want to focus on facing down animatronics, look at movement mechanics in Monster Hunter games as inspiration. Obviously not the player combat, but the monster movements and dodging. If you want to focus on avoiding combat, emphasize stealth mechanics and interacting with the environment to slow down or immobilize the enemy kinda like Amnesia, but not necessarily physics based. The claw thing would be better for escaping the monster than for finishing it off.  Without playing it, I cannot say more for my own review, but its critique like this that can at least get a creator thinking about possible improvements.   You don't have to agree with me, but I do ask you to think it over. This developer knows a lot about their craft and has made something half decent. Its got potential, but it needs significant polish and maybe even some major reworks.   A teacher once told me that there are four 'levels' to how competent you are at a given skill: 1) Unconscious Incompetence - you are not good and you also don't know how bad you are yet. You've just started learning and maybe you've made some things you're proud of, but they don't stand up to any professional work of the same type. 2) Conscious Incompetence - you are not good and you now know how bad you are. Yes this is a good thing and a sign of improvement because, now, you can start to see your own mistakes and learn from them. 3) Conscious Competence - You are good, but you really have to focus on the task to keep that level of skill. You've learned a lot, but there is still a lot of work to go. You make great content but sometimes it shows that you haven't mastered the skill yet. 4) Unconscious Competence - You are good and now you don't even have to focus on the task to do it with great skill. You may or may not be a master, but anyone who sees your work knows you know what you're doing and you'll continue to get better even though you're already pretty damn fantastic.  If you're level 2 or higher, only you know exactly what level you're at. If you're level 1, sometimes it takes someone telling you that you aren't as good as you think you are to push you into level 2.  For all the creators out there still honing their craft, just know you'll get to level 4 if you keep working at it. Accept critique. You don't have to agree with it, but take it into consideration. Don't dwell on it, but consider it. Usually creators are their own biggest critics, so make sure you don't bum yourself out.  Now this is a long-ass comment and if you read to the end, then I appreciate your time investment. Why did I post this here? Mostly because of Mark's resistance to giving any criticism. Its important for learning so don't be afraid to helpfully critique something. Their previous heartbreak shouldn't have any bearing on their project if they still intend to make it. They kept on even though they got denied by Scott. That takes motivation and determination. So if they want to keep at it, you shouldn't baby them and tiptoe around their feelings.
Foxy: * goes into stalk mode, then bugs out to be stuck that way * Mark: Ohhhhhhhhh poochie! Who's a good boy?! * Shocks Foxy out of stalk mode * Foxy: * resumes chase mode * Mark: Oh he's just a bit temperamental.

a happy surprise to see you play this, but you really should've done the tutorial lol
Everyone loved laughtoni baloni until he killed 35 children
I love the videos you make Markiplier
22:00 “maybe I should’ve read the tutorial.. No I can figure this out”  Classic Mark doing the things the hard way and testing the limits of his body🧡🧡🧡
This game is insanely good and deserves a whole dedicated team. Seriously.
I prefer this to Security Breach, I like this "Animatronic Hunter" idea
This is the first video that lixian actually jump scared me at the end
sorbet
nah wait this is crazy cool, i love the travel aspect to different locations this woulda been dope as a full game why tf didn’t it get greenlit??
Indiana is on the map, but the marker is in the WORST CITY. Gary Indiana, crimes on a corpse. I think the meant Chicago Illinois.
bruh video buffered as soon as mark said jumpscare warning i instantly paused to make sure it was real XD
Guess Foxy in the end wasn't after him, just the treats stashed in Marks pocket.. It was adorable to see Mark interact with Foxy after foxy basically says.. "Feck it you lost to me a few times now I'll be nice 🙂"
YES. I WAS WAITING FOR THIS 8D
im not entirely sure i understand if that was the objective but OK WOOHOO YEAH DAS A GUD PUBBO
The game is unsettling at its finest
Speaking of the fanverse is mark ever going to play one night at flumpty's 3?
You gotta do all the objectives mark cmonnnnn
Lixian Jumpscare If you agree click dislike . Please                |                \/
The lore for this is so much more interesting than Security Breach, rip
You should check out Five Nights at the Krusty Krab Chapter 3
you were so wrong for that last jumpscare 😭
Theres an ice cream chain near me called Flubbs so “Sir Flubs alot” might be off the table too…
i would die to meet markiplier
When mark says my channel name 🤤✨

its time to let fnaf die.... please, give us "scotts tots" instead..
dear lawd Mark is a TABS model
Hey Mark you should really try "In Sound Mind" a wonderful scary game that came out not too long ago
The random walking noise sounds like the snapping thing from the guys and dolls musical
Saying you don't want to shit on a game is very understandable, these devs are probably really upset after scott rejected them.  But there's a difference between shitting on a game and giving reasonable critiques that could help potentially better the overall play experience.
video's like this are the best way for a developer to improve his craft, i hope the creator keeps working on this because it shows promise
What was that you said to Wade in 7 Days to Day?. Hmmmmm?. XD I think it was something about not panicking!. XD Love the content Mark, keep up the funny content.. CX
28:40 Mark is really out here like F your dreams, F your nightmares
While buggy and unfinished, it's still better than security breach and probably has fewer bugs too.
Mork *skips tutorial in a quite complicated game*  also Mork: AAAAGH why isn't it working  (im just sad bc i know for a fact that some ppl are only gonna watch this vid and then take it as it is the WHOLE game, but like unintentionally he skipped like at least 50% of mechanics) sade
I'm watching this video with a fever of 102.4 and it actually made me feel better👍 Thanks Mark
I found it a little silly that the player characters in these first-person games are always faster and more agile than what's normal for the average person. Mark was practically flying everywhere.
tbh still fewer bugs than security breach
So has anybody told Mark that he only played like half of the demo? No? Nobody curious about the other objectives?
Congrats on 1 on trending
Mark taiming foxy was the most wholesome thing ever
Honestly it would be interesting if mark plays the new-ish five nights at treasure island game
When Mark said he was back he wasn't kidding. Damn.
So is anyone gonna claim the Laftoni Baloni name because I would love to see a game named that
I do have a game concept and me and my team is working on making it tho we dont have any funding so it might fall short
Mark: *trying very hard not to complain about the game even though it's obviously frustrating him* Foxy: *stops chasing him and let's mark walk up to smooch and pet him* Mark: NEVERMIND!! BEST GAME!! HOW DARE YOU SCOTT!!!
Aftonbuilt > fnaf
Not gonna lie, I would totally play Laftoni Boloni
Oooo that’s cool how foxy was like a literal dog it’s kinda cute I would make it my pet 😂🤩❤️
I absolutley love watching you mark! You’ve made me laugh when I was at my lowest times and I love watching your horror games!
Laftoni Baloni: How did you get one of these anyway? This wasn't public knowledge..  Mark: He's made of CAKE!!
I can already tell I'm going to love this
I ate cheese while watching this
The fact that Scott actually walked away from this....
wait..... so why did Matpat waste so much time fiddling with the blinding light gizmo. Mark just said fuck it and never used the mechanic lol
Nice! Mark got the Good Boy Ending
*Uses stun flash on your new friend Foxy* Foxy: WHY THOUGH?!
We love you Markiplier keep up the good work and take care of yourself
NUMBER ONE IN GAMING!!! CONGRATULATIONS 🎊
Can someone explain to me why its bad to give constructive critism? At least last I heard the game would be complete even though it didnt make it in. Or am I wrong about that?
I do hope they make something else out of this
ngl I actually love those cutscenes, if they simply cleaned them up a bit, maybe added some color, or kept it black and white, they'd be great.
I know for a fact someone will make laftoni Baloni like big face.
Remember when mark didn't know how to pronounce Scott Cawthon's name?
Mark needs Wade to come in here and really just fuck this guys dreams. And perhaps his nightmares.
I like how Mark refuses to criticize the game's bugs. What a chad
I had thought it said "Fazbear frig fit"
They love storyboards i see,a blue print.
Maybe that's why it wasn't accepted by Scott eh?
He’s a good boy took me out immediately 😂😂😂😂
okay but i loved watching the cutscenes??? like sure they’re just story boards but oh my god the art style is so enjoyable!!! i can imagine how cool they’d look fully animated or even just as animatics!
Literally my day got better seeing you post holy frick. Thank you bro ima enjoy this video so much
#1 trending gaming already lol
This is just insight to how conversations with Chica go.
Afton is supposed to have a British accent right??
Ok, but the fact that this is a FAN MADE game and it's this good
Mark talking smack about this being a game of crushed dreams while it repeatedly crushes his dreams lol
This concept is so good and actually scary? It’s awesome to see more about the remnants and stuff in the story, and I really wonder what the protagonist of the game is planning to do working with Afton
NICEEE
‌
I understand why it didn’t make it into the official cannon, but it’s still an amazing game and concept. I love this head cannon of Aston as well. It would have intercepted the progression of the universe and SB is probably why, but still, this would be great like, after SB or so
20:24 Mark scared me when I least expected it
Revised version: Making fnaf fan games can be a good way to test the waters as a new dev, because its a fan game you have to be willing to release it for free. This removes price from the equation when people consider the quality of your work. Because its a fnaf fan game you already have a fan base willing to test it rather than making a new unknown ip and throwing it to the either of the internet hoping people will try it. This is actually a good topic to bring up in my next lets dev video.
The sound not syncing with his mouth is unsettling to me a little and idk why because it’s barely noticeable 😂
I wonder if he will ever go back to dark deception
That voice 10:11 kinda sounds like Mark. When he's being serious of course instead of his usual derpy self.
Idk if im the only one who noticed that they turned foxy into a dog life animal, and so far the only one i know of that has referenced foxy as a dog is mark back in fnaf 4
Am I the only one who gets slightly annoyed at Mark not doing tutorials? Or how he doesn't take anything seriously at all?
Everyone’s like “bruh we’re the fuck is Bonnie in security breach” y’all forgot about foxy lol ngl tho I never thought once about it until this vid for some reason
This game has clearly had very very minimal game testing  outside of the developers but I hope it gets better
I’m happy Mark is playing this game and bringing it into the light, this is a great game!
Foxy once again demonstrates that  he is no one's "poochie"
I love mark, but he is being way to harsh on aftonbuilt's PROOF OF CONCEPT. The story of this games lack of development sucks and its so sad knowing stuff like this happens all the time. I hope the devs of aftonbuilt can find success sooner than later.
I love how he had a whole demonstration to himself that you HAVE to see the explosive to be able to activate it and yet on that ONE CLAW he forgets the demonstration!!!
Dude i started watching ur channel..7 years ago AND NOW IM GRADUATED
i would play the fuck out of Laftoni Baloni's Laugh-a-palooza
CHEESE
nice video mark!
"Laftoni Baloni" is one of the best names that Mark have came up with
🤔
38:19 ... this is your daily dose of internet
I can see why Scott was reluctant to put this game on the FNaF Fanverse... Didn't approve of the tamable Foxy with the irresistible boopable booper snoot. End comment, thank you for reading.  The developers of this game should continue working on this project, I think it'd turn out pretty nice, given what they've already done with it.
All they need to do is change the name and plait along with a few characters and this could be a real game
I consider a lot of fnaf fan games to be my head canon 😄
Hey Mark, I just want to say that you helped me though a lot of stuff. I've been suicidal and I feel lost.  You help me through this. You are awesome.
Noooo! Mark, you can't make out with animatronics! The Lady's jealous!
I don’t wanna be mean but this is super janky
4:25 Uhhh.... that's not Mississippi
Markiplier: "I'm blue."  Me: "By internet obligations, I am forced to do this (inhales)..."               "Da ba dee da ba di, Da ba dee da ba di!"
I think I can see why Scott rejected it. Probably had nothing to do with the quality of the project itself. We can all see that the look and mechanics of the game are pretty well done. It's probably the heavy reliance on this made up lore that was an issue to Scott. Not only does it add lore that Scott maybe did not want to have (Aftons voice, the fact that he is still somewhat sane and can be talked with, the current year, how Afton survived etc.), but this game only makes sense with that exact lore.  In order to change the main objective of rebuilding afton, they would have to do a lot of things from scratch. Change models, voicelines, even the storyboard they set up. The developers kind of put themselves into a corner, relying on Scott to approve of their lore for him to accept the game.
Bruh Lixian’s editing for this is so unhinged in the best way possible, I love this
Am i the only one who thought the guy talking at 11:17 sounded a lot like Mark???
“is that from the goofy moofie”
I know this might seem a little weird but this game is made by a non-American the driver in the cutscene at the start had the wheel are the right side witch means its not American
dog.
L
the proof of concept animatic at the beginning was more engaging than the final ending comics in security breach ngl
so happy to have regular uploads again
funny that he gets 6 out of 6 for the tsk but still continues to try get more lol
As much as I love that a creator like Mark brings attention to games like this, choosing not to play the tutorial and then getting mad that you don't know how to play is frustrating to see. You can't blame the dev for that! You also can't blame them when you don't notice the mission update notification...there was more to this!!
It’s a shame Mark couldn’t figure out that he had multiple objectives.
AMAZING CONCEPT!! I LOVE IT!! A bit janky, but thats ok!
i wanna see mark play It Steals
I’m sorry but did the map In the beginning say Louisiana was Mississippi 😂

Can't wait to see more of this
"rejected by scott for reasons" What, did the developer vote democrat?
We need some more Beard Scratching ASMR.
Wow this game looks better than Security Breach on the highest graphics setting, maybe that’s why Scotty boy didn’t like it
I didn't think we would see this. If you haven't heard, aftonbuilt was a cancelled fnaf fan verse game Scott turned down.
I'm pretty sure aftonbuilt was rejected from the fanverse because it wasn't "marketable" enough, couldn't produce merch with iconic characters ect.
I wanna SIR FUBS A LOT FUNFARE Game please someone make it happen

No.. the poor rat 🐀
The junkyard gives me I Robot vibes
Crazy how this game is still more polished than security breach

It would be much weirder if it was out of FnaF context since you're reviving a corpse
I'm only 30 seconds into the game, but I'mma wait until it's dark and I'm alone to watch it. Because why the fuck not?
...does he realize that he cant jump when injured??
That incomplete storyboard was more plot than we've gotten from Scott from all these flipping games throughout all these years xD
4:25 "is this from the Goofy Movie?"    No Mark, I don't think so
Glad your back
I actually really like this version of Afton - real life serial killers are commonly charismatic, they have to be in order to manipulate victims and get away with crimes while arousing no suspicion. I mean would the kids in FNAF really have followed an obviously psychotic killer to the back of the restaurant?? Seeing Afton with more personality than killing children and AlWaYs CoMiNg BaCk really boosts this game’s concept for me, shame we didn’t get to see more of it.
Mark didn’t see that there was more objectives for the Junkyard
Krl tô 4horas atrasada
This doesn’t really belong on this video but you did mention Space atleast twice so. To be truly honest, I could totally see any new, space-related show episodes or movies making a reference to ISWM. Ex. Maybe there’s a damaged part of a ship so they just say “Ohyeah, that’s from that time we tried to Pop ‘Er In Reverse. Great idea… didn’t go so well.”
Yoooooooooo
this actually looks really cool, never expected drawn cutscenes in a fan game
man this game had such a promising premise & mechanics, big shame it didn't get finished
Oh God damn it the one at the end got me
mark me and my friend molly watch your videos at lunch and omg they are so good and fun so thank you
Laftoni Baloni.
Mark Jump scares usually don’t scare me but the one at the very end got me 😅😅😅
Spoilers in the beginning of the jumpscare
It sucks bc mark didnt even use tutorial lol like he cant get mad about stuff not working when he didnt learn most of the mechanics lol
laftoni balonis lafapalooza is the best name i’ve ever heard
Everyone always talks about the bologna but never the Toni
Please play one night at Flumpty’s 3
As a person who was born in Mississippi and raised in Louisiana. Louisiana is definitely marked as Mississippi in the game. Lol
Has anyone noticed that at 2:58 it’s a reference to in space (“what did we do?”)
as an artist, who may want to make games the future, i really appreciate the storyboard and every thing mark said about making your own game. I a lot of the stories writing i am writing are a mismass of fanfics i wanted to write. That is the basics of inspiration!
When mark trys to scare us in the intro and outro my brain doesnt expect it to the extent that I dont comprehend so they dont scare me -im glad im stupid somtimes
Aftonbuilt Built on Fat Nail Of Butt
This looks fantastic, for a demo I love it. This could definitely be a great game
graphically this looks great and i like the concept of it but i think it has a few too many moving parts and the mechanics need a bit of work..i do think though if the devs keep working on it this game will be really great! even with the issues the bones of the game has serious potential!
also u should try fatal frame 2 its very scary
Not gunna lie it's kinda weird hearing someone that I've never met say my name.......minus the built.
This was kinda painfull to watch, in the Foxy bit..  1) please readt the tutorials. 2) why do you keep doing the same thing over and over again, seeing it dosnt work? 3) it wasnt the games fault you kept on getting nibbled on, by Foxy - you tested out the controlls and the line of sight thing, but kept on 'doing a Mark', as me and my fiance call it now (sorry)  Cool game and interesting story, could see it going far. Also, tbh i dont know how true the whole 'scott didnt let the peeps put this game into his' thing is..
mark u should try bigfoot vr or phasmaphobia vr with the boys
Laftoni baloni
Laughoni baloney
its sadly not the real markiplier in this video. if it was he wouldve just went straight into the game without tutorials knowing jack squat about what he was doing
Isnt afton the guy that like..... *murdered children?*
Damn I wish this were a full game  this shit is awesome
it is very funny watching mark get confused why the bomb isn't working
7:43
Love your videos!
the poor creators of this game deserved better than what scott did to them.
Lix should add a flash bang warning cuz GODDAMN MY EYES

FNaF Fan Verse? This Is My Faforite By My Friend :v
This game has better movement than call of duty
this looks more functional than security breach
Mark tells Lixian to make him funny, instead Lixian is made funny and we laugh at him instead of Mark lol.
Mark: "I'm Blue..."  My Brain: "Da ba dee da ba DIE?"
Is the person who voices afton here the same person who voiced afton in squimpus mc grimpus's five nights at freddy's youtube thing?
Hrmmmm… I kinda wanna watch this ‘cause I love Mark and I love FNAF… but the shitty entitled fans make me afraid to look into it and any other new FNAF fangames. Still holding out hope he can get to the third Flumpty one day. No rush, obviously, love you, Mark. The King is too good for his subjects. EDIT: So I’m finally watching this with my sister about a week after upload and OH MY GOD. This is the game the fanbrats are tantruming over? I mean, it looks good and has some interesting concepts, which is all I expect out of a FNAF fangame, but this couldn’t have less to do with FNAF!?!?
I have watched this being played by multiple people. He didn't play this correct at all. He glitched it. And it irritated me beyond belief. Yet, he managed to do well. But he never actually made any progression because he was suppose to go in building to unlock a Mission for Bonnie to shock foxy. And he never closed the flood gates. But I still loved this
i'm only like 10 minutes in, but this man (William Afton...?) is giving me Neo Cortex, Crash Bandicoot 2 vibes. disguised Jafar convincing Aladdin to go steal the lamp vibes. i can't think of a third example, but _y'know?_
they forgot that Afton is brittish, that's why
I saw a video pop up about Aftonbuilt. Need to check it out.
I remember watching, I think it was theft king, about this game and the guy wanted permission from Scott and Steel Wool to commercialize this game. I understand wanting to make money on a FNaF fangame but you have to get permission before you start working. Otherwise you might as well make your own game that could work the same but it can't have established characters or the names.
I just wanna share my experience of overcoming anxiety by leaving my video playing while my mother was in the room and the part with the make out session came on and at that point I was in too deep to show weakness so I just left it on.
Am I the only one who’s made that mark pronounced California as Cal-I-forni-a 😑
Frebby fazbear
mickey's pizzeria lol
You should be honest. The concept and aesthetics of the game are cool but the mechanics are clearly awful. There’s clearly a reason this game didn’t go anywhere.
Scott: *says no to this game* Also Scott: *makes Security Breach* the biggest buggy mess
Game looks pretty well done as this demo thus far. Seems it might have a few bugs. But it's a bit hard to tell what's a bug and just Mark flailing around like he did... There's even a couple times where he says "maybe it's this" and doesn't even test to see if that's the case... But maybe that just gets edited out and thus makes him look like a very big dumb?
Now actually seeing gameplay for this game and it's kinda clear why it wasn't chosen for the fanverse. It's way too connected to the mainline games to sit on its own, this is more of a spinoff explaining a characters redesign more than a fan game with loose connections like candy's.
I really believe they should continue this game, fanverse or not.
The world would be funnier if companies went to mark for brainstorming product name ideas.
Fantastic gameplay, it looks great! Those fucking clickly feet are annoying as all hell though.  Great video Mark!!!!
I love how Mark casually promotes In Space With Markiplier
Meow
"not over"
dammit use the floodlights silly man
Lixians editing with the game's title is everything.
25:20
He should've had a British accent, but I guess they wanted to make Afton likeable in this game
I’m probably in the minority but this doesn’t look very fun. Seems incredibly frustrating due to inconstancies in game mechanics and the scramble mechanics are just super aggravating and jumps unreliable.
Mark's fully charged after in space with Markiplier. Welome back king!
read the tutorials mark...
Big ups in the word editing at the beginning. Had me rolling.
This game looks amazing
4:23 this is Indiana. Definitely not Chicago,  which is in Illinois.  nope nope. definitely INDIANA.
As humans have we ever bought milk that came from the same cow twice?
Ok I’m in love with the storyboards, the dev clearly animates.
Door stuck moment
Map: This is Indiana  Indiana: *clearly Illinois in disguise*
Mark's really bad at this game  Cuz no mark. U were not in line of sight. The arm blocked it
30:30 he said the thing
Scott isn't stupid, he knew this game would make it big cause it has great potential, graphics, sound design, voice acting& new mechanics.
people keep forgetting afton is british
I can see after IN SPACE WITH MARKIPLIER Mark is having another creator itch looking at the title screen lol
Very disappointed that this didn’t get Greenlit for the Freddy Fanverse Initiative. It looks phenominal
Laftoni Baloni is actually a good name
The game looks very... tedious.
That tentacle shit looks like something from Soma
3:27 ...write that down WRITE THAT DOWN GAME DEVS!!! I WANNA PLAY SIR FLUBS ALOT! XD GAME DEVS U NEED TO MAKE THIS!!!
Every OC creator's dream
He do be built like that tho
im ngl when i saw the notification i thought it said aftonbutt T-T
Read that as Afterbuilt, then thought it was supposed to be Afterbirth, then realized I was just wrong. Great video!
I'm guessing that this game didn't get approved was because the central premise revolved around actually talking to Afton. That would ruin the mystery of Afton built up over 6+ games. Also you move at the speed of Ranger lmao.
Oh,that..that intro Hello everybody my name is Markiplier. That intro Reminds me so many things Time really flies so fast
Tonfa Built. thats all i have to add, have a nice daaaay
7:06 Da ba dee da ba dai, da ba dee da be dai
You just made my shitty day way way better 👌🥺 thank you mark
hold on a minute did he just say the calendar is 2023? well, i hope noone lives in florida, i say this because that fire was both caused by old things, and florida man.
Climate crisis > video games, if we care about the next generations of people at all
Laftoni Boloni😭
ONAF 3 ONAF3! GOD PLEASE!
I get what Mark's saying, I mean from a fan perspective yes it's fun to make things as tribute, like you see lots of FNAF or Pokemon knock offs, I've even dabbled in it myself. However I also agree you can just as easily create your own properties from said concepts which I have also done.
9:23 I'm not gonna watch something with multiple endings because I am almost guarantee to get the bad ending on the first watch.
ONLY 3K COMMENTS WOOOOO!!! IM EARLY!
If you all like this, you should really convince mark to play Jr's
Ah, Fapton Built. My favorite 5 Night's at Freddy's inspired erotic game. If you aren't careful, she'll fuck you. TO DEATH!
You should play a new game called The Booty Creek Cheek Freak
Remember to give support to the team behind this game cuz they made a really good project and are incredibly talented and got screwed out of a deal so please give them lots of support
Way too funny!!
Gee, I wonder why this game failed to hit production
9:04 Did you not see the bugs before?
I wanna see a game called 'Fazbear Frieghts' and its all about transporting parts and goods between locations - and if something spooky happens along the way....
He's climbing the YouTube tower, keep up the good work.
Memento Mori, Unus Annus
"The Physical Embodiment of Crushed Dreams" title of my sextape
I think mark forgot that besides the tamper locks, he has to destroy the animatronics to get the stuff out. Hence needing to close the sewage gates and flood the animatronic itself
imagine the universe where we got this instead of security breach
Hearing what you said about horror games not FNAF oriented, I heard of a game on roblox called "Some Nights at the Arcade". The demo is released, and it's pretty good for what it is. If you ever get the chance, check it out.
6:54 It's an empty suit, Mark.
Mwuemfodnsjokdkfoskwiqidiufoks.             *sry grandma had stroke
Watching this was hard, I don’t like how much mark struggled with the mechanics, it made it unenjoyable. Kinda like security breach, too buggy, ruined the experience for me
Hi kaylo I see you
This guy in the cutscene clearly did not watch a heist with markiplier
Mark..No, Don't try and tell folks to make the game their own. Because folks did that and Scott sued them.
Wow! This is a fan made game?!
Really hope marks wise words at the start reach the ears of a lot of upcoming devs
4:07 XD
I would love for someone to make a Sir Flubbsalot games XD
I read the tutorial in the time it took him to close it quicky omg its so painful to watch
was that the map from the goofy movie? and that is when scott was done
This game just wasn’t a good enough investment for Scott in the merchandising area. Probably only reason why it didn’t get greenlit
It's 2022 I guess the game travel to the future
Boop
Mark: "This needs line of sight" Also Mark: *breaks line of sight* "Why doesn't it work!?"
This game has better cutscenes than sb
YASSSSS MARK FIANLLY DID THIS!!
I saw ‘Afton’, and that’s all I needed to click on the video 😌
FNAF reference?
Definitely made me jump ALOT 🤣
lean man off a perc btw. just so youre aware markimoo
Lol
...I'm super hyped to play "Sir Flubs-a-lot's Fun Fair."
I hate to say it but saying you won't crush someone's dream's in the way you did is still rude man!
mark what are you doing man are you putting out a full year of content in a month so you can disappear?  Please dont quit youtube man, I really enjoy your videos.
3:32 why did I hear "sir fucks alot". _.
Wait what? The Male voice is almost sound like  Markiplier? what the hell?
LAFTONI BALONI!!!!
The problem the Devs had with Scott was that he never explicitly rejected it, but also never approved it. He always left them dangling wanting them to work on it more and more without any guarantee it would actually make it in the end
Oh I'm early... Neat! Time to watch the video!
yes more fnaf
I'm so disappointed he didn't shout "WAS THAT THE CLAUSE OF 87?!" at 7:40
This honestly has so much potential the idea and game play honestly if this was fully released I bet it do better then fnaf:sb that game a buggy unfinished mess. Also after what I heard about what scott did that just messed up.
Gonna be honest, "Madness Hank and FNaF Springtrap Adventures" is a much better name for this game
If all of the bugs could be fixed, this could’ve been a better game than Security Breach
"Doesn't have to be a FNAF game, make your own scary game!" - Problem is funding. Who is paying? If it's not FNAF, then Cawthon is surely not paying.    This game is cancelled due to lack of funding. Fanverse developers specifically are in there for the Money. Money makes the world go round, and if I get 10k per month I'll be capable of developing a much better fangame compared to if I had to do it after my dayjob for free.  That's not looking down at the devs either, it's just the cold hard truth of the world. Making games requires money.
39:00 Chica is gonna be so mad.
2:59 AYO IS THAT A IN SPACE WITH MARKIPLYER REFERENCE?????
FNAF is a steaming pile of dead garbage, can people just give up already
Mission one down other missions some other time good demo for one level it's multiple missions are interesting and easy to bug
It’s very heartwarming how Mark is trying so hard to push others to create their own! If y’all have an idea, run with it! There’s no stopping you!❤️
the controls are janky, narrow straights so you get stuck in the wall and ramfisted by the tronics,half the commands are daft and i see why scott dont wanna make a real version cus this was daft
Mark may say he respects the developers, but it's annoying how he doesn't even bother learning the mechanics or looking at the objectives of this game!
Afton is an old word for evening in Swedish.
Everyone saying how it’s a shame this game didn’t make it into the Fanverse CLEARLY didn’t play the game themselves, nor did they hear about all the drama and legal issues that happened not long after this “demo” came out.
3:05-4:12 Goofy as hell but facts lol XD
Snarky marky
Scott declining this game but letting something like FNAFSB be rushed was the same risk they'd both have. I haven't watched anything on this game yet but I can guarantee that SB was just as risky. Edit: both are just as buggy if you'd ask me, but I like the idea of this game
Yey!!! Hi lixian!!!
this game was amazing. But Scott Cawthon thought the opposite. Even though he made the original fnaf. He missed an opportunity of a great game. Instead, he made Security Breach which was a flop
Excellent yeah excellent!!!!!!.
This is way scarier than ANY FNAF game. It's also not a clone but an original thing. i Love it
He’s playing more fangames like: Aftonbulit (this), Sonic.EXY, and that’s all I can remember but still though usually Mark doesn’t play them maybe like once a year or so.
Hello Mark my name is right on top of this text your probably wont read this but i do not care, because i want to and this is making me very happy i am very sorry for the bad writting my primary language is not english it is french from Québec you are my faverite youtouber sorry for th mispelling and one of my idols but i dont think i have the courage to do what you do in life, i wanted to say thank you for all you have done and making my problemes go away ever since i saw you on YouTube my life has been less scary i have watched you since i was like 8 years old even of you sweard a lot again sorry for the bad writting you are just so cool  😎  if some how you read this i just wanted to say i love all you did with your channel and how you stabalized my life if you come to Québec one day i Hope that i can have the chance to meet you and can give you a hug that is one of my dreams im not commenting on videos becose i think it is a waste of time but you are my faverite soooooooo congratulation YOUR the spécial one and thank tou again i Hope i get to meet you one day i love what you do keep it up and even if you dont see this it as made my day again sorry for mispeling but Who cares not me lol, anyway have a great day Hope i get the chance of meeting you one day thank you again and i Hope my dream comes true have a great day or night and please come to Québec one day but it does not mater because i dont think you are going to see this but anyway thank you and have a great day 😊😁🤓
Mark got the good ending
What I think is really freaky is that about two weeks before I even heard of the game Aftonbuilt, I had a dream that I was being chased around a field with a guard tower by a Foxy animatronic that walked on all fours and had one glowing eye. Despite the guard tower being unlocked, I never went inside. Instead, I stuck with running around the field trying to run and hide from the dog-Foxy chasing me. And then, when I first saw Aftonbuilt, I almost freaked out because the Foxy in the game is the exact one from my dream
the only problem hes having is not having played the tutorials
I can tell that this game has potential, but it needs a loooooot of work. I can see why Scott denied this one.
3h
Aftonbuilt has a unique story. Imagine rebuilding the guy behind the slaughter ( play It's been so long)
Love as always
Markimoo What other nicknames does he have
Was that the bite of 87
I hate how Mark just DOESN'T play the tutorial. And then gets mad at the GAME for not making sense. Mark...are you fucking kidding me.
This looks promising for a fangame. What I think is happening is you've recovered Purple Guy's Soul/Conscience from the Springtrap, and I think he's working with you to re-animate himself or make him a human body or something.  - it's a really interesting concept, if I'm right though, then I can see why Scott didn't give it the green-light, because it kinda goes against the FNAF 3 lore.
why is Louisiana labeled as Mississippi
so much blessed Markiplier content
Hey mark, go check out the meme cheem and do a try not to laugh on it
Forget in SPACE W/MARKIPLIER.... I Want to see JOURNEY TO CENTER OF THE EARTH W/MARKIPLIER
its fucking gamE OVER THE KING HAS PLAYED IT NOW SOMEONE NEEEEEEEDS TO FINISH THIS STG
Ooo new FNAF fan game Should mark play omori? Because it’s horror wholesome scary can go wrong others
Play One Night at Flumpty's 3. It's the best in the series imo and I think it'd make an amazing video since none of the bigger Youtubers I watch really covered it.
7:04 da ba dee da ba di
This game has so much potential
its saving michael afton in the spring trap suit
Thanks mark, even tho I have plans for my own.
I don't understand how mark didn't even acknowledge part of the game he didn't even complete a single level. And then to mock/make fun of the creator when Mark didn't even try to figure out the game he just tried it his way instead of how it was supposed to be played. this isn't the first time gamers have done this.
I love Laftoni Baloni!
I really love how William sounds a bit normal. Despite his crimes and his overall bad history
Gammers need to repent before Its to late
im panicking im stuck i dont understand
AftonBuilt is the type of FNaF fan game I would pay for to be finished
I know i know sorry but i know that sooomeone is playing d2 and still grinding for the eyesluna  Its now come to Solar 3.0 and uhm is the Lootdungeon from the 30aniversaryBungi bugged or am i just an idiot like arent these engrams supposed to dropp out of the chamber ? when i explode the rocket ?
For people who didn’t understand the first storyboard cutscene the guy was taking the half of spring trap that ripped off to the base and setting him up on the wall
It’s pretty sad that this game didn’t take off due to conflicts over legal stuff but it’s great to see it get recognition, I’m sure the devs are super happy to see you show it some love, keep doing good mark!
Laftoni Baloni's Laffa Paloza. Gonna keep that for the future.
I read fazbears fright as fazbears frig fit 😭😭😭
He should make this into his own game not a fnaf fan game
He's got a point here fnaf fans. I've also been wondering why fnaf game devs haven't been making their own lore and characters for years now. These games are amazing for early demo concepts!
Scott is missing out! I would buy this game in a heartbeat DLC  included! (Yes there better be DLC for  this)
Mark: “i dont know what else to do” Objective list literally being there: ;-;
I see, Mark's pets do be getting abit quirky at night
12:55 did they just reference day shift at Freddy's or am I crazy?
10:05 That Oddly sounds like *Markiplier!* 😕
6:44       W A T E R M E L O N
i havent seen a horror playthrough in forever that when the tablet popped up i jumped
*_LAFTONI BALONI'S LAFAPALOOZA_*
yes finally!!!!!
I would definitely play a game called Laftoni Baloni. The name itself is terrifying
There is a lot of potential here, damn I wish this had been able to move forward.
Hi Mark i just wanted to let you know that i found a game called Port Valley and i think that it would be a fun game to bring to the channel. As always great video :)
"Make their own animatronics". For example i have five original animatronic characters, a hedgehog, bandicoot, rabbit, bear and a bird. Design-wise is not based on FNAF, but mostly on real-life animatronics and also some other stuff that served as inspiration for the designs.
FNaF fan game. Super excited.
chomper
Have I died because I think hes playing a fnaf game
So sad this didn't make it
Damn u gotta take a chill pill unkkl nukkls
"ITS A DEMO OF CRUSHED DREAMS, ITS A DEMO OF CRUSHED DREAMS" 👁👁
afton throws some stuff together and prays that it works. Yep, sounds like a programmer
Lmao nice
i fucking love this game so much, i can't wait to see what becomes of it. if the creator doesnt work on it anymore (which is understandable and not terrible at all), i think what we got is incredible, and i love the animatic in the beginning! it's nice to see 2D sketches used in something like this, that art style is so popular and smooth. it feels good to see something so nicely normal! also, its funny; as an animator, it both irks me and makes me laugh that so many people (including Markiplier) call that bit a storyboard when its actually an animatic lmao
Old Man Refuses To Read Instructions Or Look At His Menu, Yells At Cloud
Mark you need to play fnaf world
Every boyfriend i have ever had: 6:47
I mean even if you did criticize it Mark, you chose not to watch the tutorial 🤦🏾
Play fnaf world
I remember the first ever video I ever watched was your 23th birthday video 😅
Oh hey Markiplier, there's a good game called Finding the loch Ness monster. That is a good game (that will make you squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm and squirm to everyone's enjoyment) have fun.
Five Nights at Mark's
Part 2
It's kinda funny how as soon as Foxy stopped trying to be a lil murderbot, he just becomes a big ol good doggo. A big ol good doggo that looks like a giant cyberfied drowned rat.
i want british william back tbh
He's a smurf
Once again Mark fails to read and misses quite a bit of what's available in the demo. The objectives were right there
Almost like he should have read the tutorial... >_>
Scott is a coward for rejecting this game it's better than some of the stuff he's made
I love how Mark really wants the creators to continue to make this
laugh tony balooney's laughapalooza is now what im naming my next dog
its a good game but to see fail is a shame
This unfinished demo seems to be only slightly more broken and confusing than Security Breach
9:10 - 9:32 How do you know what I do at work 👀
i searched "asmr" and this video came up
Markiplier.if your reading this.if you play this again try to boop the nose on the freddy posters you see
Heyy Markiplier today's my BIRTHDAY WOOOO MY DAY OF THE BIRTH 🎊🎉🎉🎉🎂🎂🎂🎂🎉🎊🎉🥳🥳🥳
I think that this game had a lot of potential but the bugs in this demo make the whole experience a lot more frustrating when the biggest glitches have to do with important level completing mechanics.   This game could definitely be something tho. I hope they clean it up and give it that final polish it needs.
Mark: "Sir tubs alot's is on fire and you have to get something from it" Some random indie dev: "Right that down! Right that down!"
Interesting that Security Breach was greenlit, but not something like this. They’re both janky (which is expected for a demo), but this at least has some structure to it.
I like how mark was encouraging the creator to make this into their own thing. And I really hope they do.
Excellent job Lixian! Still on the Mark as always when it comes to editing
This video confirms........ mark is a furry
Fort
I like how afton is just a normal guy.
mark not realizing when he finished the objectives is the most painful thing  in other news, i adore this game- i just wanna see someone get further in it! it'd be so cool to see a full game too
Fnaf was made souly to sell merch
Margaros pizza
day 3: hey Markiplier can you play deepwoken on roblox?
This game was cancelled so that security breach could take the spotlight
I like the fact that the screen's eye move along in the voice as if afton is actually looking around, the attention to detail is really neat
Gotta love those classic thumbnails.
This game is everything that Security Breach should have been honestly
Markiplier: 7:05 I'm blue... Me who is stuck in 2015: Da bu dee da bu die
"I’m not a bastard, I would NEEEEEEEEEVER shit on someone’s crushed dreams!" proceeds to keep calling the game a CRUSHED DREAM.
CAN U PLAY THE MAN FROM THE WINDOWWWW?????
thanks Lixian for the intro jump scare!👍
7:15 This calls for an eiffel65 Edit.
I hope Laftoni Baloni make more appearances in the future
For beta it looks just as good and detailed as security breach could have ever been
Keep playing this game pls;i like it very well...hope that everything is ok and good look to the rest...
I would love to see the opening fully animated into a cutscene
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO COVER THIS!!
I cant wait to visit LAFTONI BALONI.
I wish they would continue with it
I love how after many tries and failures it became friendly and then became hostile again
Sir Flubs A Lot isn't going to be happy mark...
please play genshin impact mark  <3
The Aftons lived in London-
I think the developer has a lot of potential. Get a good team and get a new branding and they could make some awesome games.
My version of the story:  Fazbear’s frights is in the middle of burning down, and inside there just so happens to be the corpse of springtrap (William Afton). Michael afton who is the eldest son of William is told by Henry to attempt to retrieve his father. Michael succeeds and is now trying to revive his father with his knowledge of animatronics from the time he worked with his father on the past animatronics.
41:20 you son of a bitch that actually got me. My guard was down because of good puppers and the way Mark was talking.
Mark completely forgetting that he had to close the other flood gates and being confused as to why he couldn't move on.
IS THAT THE REAL LAFTONI?!!?!?
Wait another year or two and something suspiciously similar to this demo/concept will be an official release.  It's too bad this wasn't picked, it does have SO much potential behind it!
Ngl this graphically looks good. Plays like doo doo
Mark: who's a good boiiiii!!!
Mickey pizzeria
honestly though Scott's just scared of all the people who can make FNAF better than Scott could ever dream of making
you should try It steals please
Never thought I would have seen a rejected game, soo glad I get to see this game its so cool *especially the foxy modle it's so cool I love itttttttttt so much*
21:03 Wild Wolf Foxy has appeared.
"L-A-F-T-O-N-I B-A-L-O-N-I" had such ethan energy I had flashbacks to Unus Annus. I knew Mark learned something.
He didn’t even notice the “6/6” that told him he had completed the foxy thing
Mark: say buy poochie , say buy bubba, ... Foxy: NOOORAWWW Me: Poor Flark, just wanted to make a friend.
Nafton made
This is retribution for not reading the tutorial?
first
Ho is drippy!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!
I accidentally paused the jumpscare on the first frame
This game could've been an alternate universe to FNAF 3.
Will this ever be a complete game??
Avadacadabra
i think this game is hurt by the asociation whit FNAF, this is a real game but far removed from the gameplay of the original fnaf of no brain button pushing... this is more an adventure game.  no way its going to get picked up by a dude thats been making the same game over and over to great success. also it migth be too close for it to be its own game now, would need a ton of reworking to remoove the FNAF images in a way that works
7:05 DA BA DEE DA BA DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:09 BOO
Sucks what the aftonbuilt team went through only for their project to be rejected anyway.
It looks so good though. Money may have been a concern. Causing the loss of the Steam dream. Help make his dreams, a dream reality. You know instead of berating him. (I know you weren't) kind of
He had removed all the tamper locks twice, didnt check the objectives lol
I would rather play this game than security breach it still has the open world feel without it being open world. “sucking a lot of trash looking at you Chica”
Can anyone explain what's wrong with this game? They say that the type will not release anymore or something like that, I just don’t know.
Onaf 3
"Laftoni Bologna, stuffing your sandwich with goodness since 1987! Bite into it!"
Game: “Explains how to power cord leads to the button.”  Markiplier: “How I get to button?” 💙💙💙
Say whaaaat
I do like William being portrayed as "Charismatic and level headed" I mean, he's basically a cult leader so it makes sense
A parkour Fnaf game where you do Mirrors Edge type movement to get away from animatronics would be amazing
BABE WAKE UP MARKIPLIER POSTED A FNAF RELATED VEDIO
Markiplier: "I'm blue" Me: " Da ba di da ba die
3:23 - Since Scott Cawthon maxes out his political donations to people who actively oppose the rights of transgender people, frankly I couldn't give less of a fuck what he likes and wish people would stop advertising his shit and heaping praise on him.
7:04 Mark: "I'm blue" My brain: "Da ba dee da ba daa"
This is really cool but I can see why Scott rejected it.
I find it annoying how mark said he wouldn't crap on the persons work... Then referred to it as just "crushed dreams" and "failures" honey I call that craping on it- like just because the demo needs some works work and because Scott don't have any ambition and probably didn't want to be shown up by some one who's concept was more interesting then security breach was in my opinion. Does not mean it's just a crush dream because it still has promise and a future should the creater move forward underestimating this person and  calling their attempt a failure is a sore mistake.
I love mark but he is driving me crazy for blaming the game for being difficult/broken when also like half of it is that he’s playing the game without a key component cause he skipped the tutorial
For a proof of concept, this game is cool as hell. I'm glad they left the story boards in too, love seeing the process work behind stuff like this
Glad Mark gave this guy a good chance. I believe with, like he said, good polishing and better presentation this can be a great game. Make it your own universe or not and try again! This is better than anything we ever made 😂
Docile Foxy at the end was beautiful!
I think they should get back to work on the game get concept and would be a great game
Seeing Mark play a rejected fanverse game reminds he still needs to play Flumpy’s 3
man I should've been prepared for the flash bang 9 mins in 😆 my burning eyes!
i'm constantly distracted by mark's face
Jesus, will it fucking kill you to READ the tutorials and instructions.
Great video Mark! I was curious if you could do a subnautica reaction to the gargantuan leviathan?! I think that would be so GREAT. Thank you!
Probably got scrapped because the demo is already better than the full security breach game
Even though its a demo, it is more finished than AAA games 3 months after delayed release.
Why the fuck is this game about listening and helping William fucking Afton? What the fuck is wrong with this creator to do anything good to William? All that dumbass deserves is to be brought back repeatedly to endure more suffering and to die over and over until he's truly been broken to the point that he's learned that killing people was a bad choice to make. To suffer until nothing of him is left that could experience suffering.
Awesome job on the title part XD
I hope a really good artist takes the cutscenes and animates them fully, I think it would be really neat. I know as of rn the team has no intentions of finishing from what I heard, but art wise I would live it
Poor lixian needs to edit all those names at the beginning lol
7:05  da ba dee da ba di da ba dee da ba di da ba dee da ba di
Mark! Remember Flumpty’s? One Night at Flumpty’s? The third game is out, you MUST play it!
Laftoni baloni
Mark you had to get the gate opened by Bonnie then get the power going and then go on the platform and push bonnie
OK, so I've only watched so far as the part in the very first cutscene where the truck pulls up to Fazbear's Fright, and I'm gonna go out on a limb here and take a guess that this game is going to be a mix of FNAF and Payday 2, because, based on the semi-legible phone call, I get a lot of Payday 2 vibes, it seems very heist-y (no pun intended (reference to Heist with Mark)) so we'll see what happens and I will update this when I watch further and determine whether I was right or not.  Update: I was wrong. The beginning cutscene looked like a heist and I thought he would have to actually break Afton out inside the game.
Early
Scott sees Aftonbuilt, denies it.  Scott sees Security Breach, gives all clear.  Kay.
I love how mark is still using the fnaf 2 door in the thumnail
Demo looks annoying lol
Still less janky than SB
I’m now waiting for “Sir Flubsalot Fun Fair” to be made.
Lixian does way too damn much.
Mark: I’m blue  Me: dabba di dabba di dabba di dabba di dabba di dabba di
Mark should watch the video from "Core" here in Brazil to understand all the lore
HI MARK I LV U
Quicker you do the skillcheck, the more time you save for the next one.
The fact Mark mentioned Scott's Tots killed me.
the guy speaking on the Afton Robotics personal assistant device sounds like Spamton G Spamton
bro i thought its one of shity fan game but I'm in shock it's very good
Marks reaction to the Good Boi is exactly how mine was and I love that for him
who's 😺 a ✨ good 👍 boy 🍼 who's 🌿 a 🍭 good 😡 boy 💵 who's 🧃 a ☠️ good 🍄 POOCHIE 😃
Mate idk why people are  upset. Scott saying that it doesnt align with the current state of the fnaf lore means that this probably has more potential than the actual series at this point lol. I need 6 more games of this now so we can go off on our ownsies lol  Edit: also mark talking about polish at the end, this game still works better than security breach
The instantaneous shift in tone and music once Foxy became docile was excellent.  Wholesome.
Can you play Friday Night Funkin next?
Oh poor mark, already completed the task of getting rid of the tamper locks, yet not realizing it despite it saying it's completed in the scroll wheel menu multiple times.
God, it's an absolute shame that Scott rejected it. It would've been absolutely brilliant in the fnaf-verse.
7:05 Ba da bee da ba dye~
Scott isn't a risk taker all he had to do was give his input here and there so he had a say so on how he wanted the game then boom perfect fnaf game
11:19
Why not Afton Assembly? Afton Assemblies? Idk.
Love it
yo mark am i cool?
This is like FNAF meets Portal, I love it!!
This was a really good video! Unfortunately, I must go back to watching in space with markiplier 24/7
bruh those storyboards were sick
Mark: please let this be the last one The objective that’s been completed for forever: 👁👄👁 The other quest objectives that Mark has been ignoring (along with the ignored floodlights): 🤡
It sucks that Scott declined this. You know what's even worse, in my opinion? They had the chance to give the "Final Nights" series a go, but the email was sent to spam, and the developer didn't see it until it was too late. Massive sadge, boys. Makes me feel terrible.
(28:45) Markiplier: "I WILL NEVER SHIT ON SOMEONE'S CRUSHED DREAMS!" "Goes to an Ad" LMAO 😂😂😂
People are allowed to want to make FNAF fan games. They're making it because they want to. There's plenty of FNAF formula games that do well and aren't directly FNAF fan games
Aftonbuilt had so much great concepts, and I don't even know why it got rejected, the idea is brilliant, and it had potential, it had great designs for the animatronics and an interesting storyboard. No hate to you Scott but why did you reject this masterpiece?
As much as I love this I can definitely see why Scott didn’t approve. There’s a whole lot of stuff going on early on all at the same time. But I would love to see it completed
OMG MY FRIENDS MADE THIS ITS SO COOL TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE I REMEMBER SEEING THE PROGRESS OF IT
Sir Flubs-a-lot and Laftoni Baloni’s laffapalooza made me giggle so hard i snorted uncontrollably
33:17 WOAHH maaaa GOD LOL
30 mintues late damn
When is his minecraft seires comingback?
Ltterly as you about to see the creature an add popped up about anime Murch.
Really upsetting this game didn't make it, it's a awesome one
Melty
So its super silly but my name is Toni and this made me so goddamn happy. No one ever uses my name!! THANKS MARKIPLIER lol
Yay MORE FNAF
“Scott Cawthon might not like [Scott’s Tots]”  Mark he added a game where he dies to the fanverse
Bruh, editor acknowledges the mic slap but not Mark’s random movement 😂
I was going to say Mark is Scott's favourite person so maybe... but anyways, I hope the developer of Aftonbuilt doesn't quit as a game dev, they've shown great potential.
PRAISE OUR LORD 🔜☮️ THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST FOR BEING OUR SAVIOR 🍻praise our LORD 🩸 thank you for being our savior jesus Christ
I’m a simple person, I see Afton, I click.
Honestly I feel like this would have been better than the last one lol
half of this video was literally mark running around and typing on his keyboard…
4:07 Someone: what's your favorite fnaf fangame Me: *LAFTONI BALONI* Someone: wha- Me: *LAFTONI BOLOGNESE*
Aftonbuilt is actually a very good Five Nights at Freddy's fan game. The concept is cool, and the story is interesting. Aftonbuilt is an awesome and frightening game. It's such a shame that it's left unfinished. Aftonbuilt has the potential to be a phenomenal game. Aftonbuilt is an amazing game.
Issa mood
I like the way he talks to lixian
“It’s a full on cutscene! I mean it’s a story board but it’s a cutscene!” I mean… that was good enough for like five of Security Breach’s ending.
laftoni baloni's laughapalooza is an amazing name for a fnaf fangame. mark is going big brain time, like the meme says.
I have a lot of great concepts for horror games but I don't have any good tech to do it with. Or any people to help.
Honestly the concept of this game is sooo cool. If they just worked out the kinks in the game, it would be amazing. The graphics are incredible too!
Man's gotta be tired of this by this point.
freddy in fortnite💀
Dang it I almost got all the way through without getting jumped scared, but the final moment one
personally, I expected Afton to have a much more sinister tone as a digital consciousness, similar to Arnim Zola from Marvel. I do appreciate that he seems to be manipulating the main character though.
Someone needs to make Sir Flubs-a-Lot's Funfair and Laftoni Baloni's Laugh-a-Palooza as actual games now.
I don’t get why Scott rejected Aftonbuilt, it’s such a cool concept
This honestly looks really neat, I really wish it was something we saw become a full game
Aftonbuiltdiffernt
I told that in the past and I am gonna tell it again: Afton was never evil. What he had was a severe mental illness that basically corrupted him. I mean, from a charismatic, genius businessman and family man to a psychotic child murderer, shit has to have gone down besides the deaths of his children!!
Mark, please, for just one game please read the tutorials...
Markiplier I’m one of your fans pls pray for me because I broke my foot
Security breach: who are you?!  Aftonbuilt: i am you but SOOO much better
markk raft had many updates visit it again with bob and wade
Thanks for the video, they always cheer me up when I’m going through a tough time!
no comment just love your creativity in jokes.
aftonbuilt different
Shame this wasn't merchandisable enough for Scott.
Ohh this is a good concept
Watching Mark ignore the objectives and keep doing the thing he had had completed for 20 minutes was a little infuriating, right? I'm not crazy?
You should definitely play five nights at treasure island
“Laftoni baloni”-Markiplier 2022
I accidentally fast forwarded 10 seconds into the video and just pure chaos
why is mark in my left ear
i miss unus annus
Man after all the drama of Scott's retirement I feel bad for the guy
What a shame that it didn't make it into the fanverse...
I can officially say I am here before this video reaches 1 million views…
I was hoping you’d play this, saw Dawko play this a while ago.
Actually it was built up to a degree and Scott accepted it into the fan thing, but Scott after a while was decidedly weird and dismissive after some time.
notifications ded
Doesn't Scott have a book called FazBear Frights
Thanks!
i recommend everyone watch videos on the development of the game, apparently scott dragged the devs on for months before denying them the slot
I really hope they do something with this game. Remove the Fnaf branding and make it its own thing. This game can stand on its own.
This game definitely has potential. And I think it's better off not being a fnaf spin-off. Make your own universe my guy, I'm sure it will be successful.
Woah
When I saw the notification for this I didn’t know if this was going to be a real game or a gag game with an afton that’s was /built/, like the muscles kind. Not sure if disappointed or relieved tbh
"Please perform the minor physical effort known as moving" I will make it my goal to use it in a covnersation without context
I love how Mark just ended up making friends with Foxy Poochie, it was kinda cute!!
Strange how I want to play this more then security breach XD
On this day, mark tamed and befriended a super horrifying version of foxy
For some reason, I feel like I’ve seen this before.
Is that William Afton?! Springtrap?!?! Dude, this would’ve been part of Help Wanted and Sister Location. holy crap! that would explain how Afton became Glitchtrap and possessed people(Vanny).
play game  "I form the darkness" Please....
While we’re on the FNAF Fan game Train again One Night At Flumpty’s 3 came out recently Mark
That's crazy, I just watched a video on why this game didn't make it and few days later Mark plays it.
“I’m playing the embodiment of crushed dreams”
Hey mark I really wanna get a pined comment
Foxy suddenly becoming tame: *“never let ‘em know your next move”*
Mark: “Sir Flubsalot’s Funfair”  Everyone: “WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!”
7:05 da be de dabe die
7:04 dabedee dabedie dabedeedabedie
i love the fact that they made the screen tablet show the emotion all in the eyes 12:19
E
Oh shit I’ve been waiting for this to be on the channel, but you should also play “It steals” one of the best horror games ever.
Now someone has to make a game about Laftoni Baloni’s Lafapalooza.
I just realized he's playing as purple guy or something similar
MARK NEED TO PLAY SALLY FACEEEE
My friend and me I made a  trailer for Mickey’s pizzeria Movie
I feel like this video was taken after recording the latest of Distractible 😅😂
Was expecting Sir Flub's Grubs. (Side Note: If anyone does anything with the idea, Sir Flub _has_ to be a a walrus. Or maybe even a seal of some sort. Flubberiest fells I know.)  Mr. Iplier going on about the crushed dreams and being so dramatic makes me imagine the actual rejection was just a really chill and casual conversation, lol.  Poochie bit caught me very off gaurd.
Everytime im depressed your videos always make me happy man... keep making videos plz ive been watching since youve played slender
Hope this is worth a revisit.
yes you would, and probably will
I love the hand drawn cutscenes
Please play this again!
The concept of helping William Afton regain his own body and continue his research is...absolutely horrifying. I wish there was a full version of this.
Nice.
The game is just a boss rush tbh
Are there flash warnings? Yes Am I bouta risk my health to watch a Markiplier video? Absolutley 😌
Why does the boss sound like Joey drew
There’s a video about who aftonbuilt didn’t make it into the fan verse, the makers of this game put a lot of love into it and they just kept going nowhere with Scott and getting it in the fan verse
The song at the beginning was dope tho
There's a light used to stun foxy
Hey Mark since your playing Aftonbuilt ya think you want to play Onaf 3?
Would it be too much to ask you kindly to play One Night at Flumpty's 3?
U know I just finished all the in space with markiplier routes but it's a pity these take so long and have so much expenses I can imagine, but I really can't wait for the next
A
Well look at security breach it was a very pastionate game just like this scott needs to give the devs for this the time they need just like fnaf plus
Laftoni bloni
I want so bad to play a game called LAFTONI BALONI
WOW, ive been waiting for this game, saw some video about it. And about scott maybe supporting it. Never expecting it to actually be played :) this is sick 👍
This is so awesome
Hey mark! How are u doing? Hopefully good ^^
LAFTONI BALONI!!
This dev or dev team clearly had passion for the game. Which even though it was denied doesn't mean they can't make up their own horror game. They have the in game assets and if they do some redesigns, they could make a cool story taken place after a animatronic takeover.
Foxy looks like a average sized pitbull.
So basically, from what I've been reading: Scott rejected the game because it had too much detail and that amount of detail costs a shit ton of money and he didn't trust the devs to actually finish it OR he didn't think it would be popular and gain enough traction. I'm not exactly sure which one it is but it could be something entirely different..
This is awesome. I hope Scott will accept it
This project really had big potential as we saw on the video but it has and when I say has a lot of stuff working on I think Scott didn’t want to take the game or fund it since it’s just really big i mean the whole premise of the project is insane so it will cost a lot of budget so presumable Scott was like no thanks
Awe, now I see why this game didn't make it. They didn't make afton *Bri'ish*
Quick summary for people who're curious:  Aftonbuilt was made for the Fanverse Initiative. Scott liked the idea but didn't agree to officially fund them and had them continue development on their own for a while. Scott was generally pretty bad at responding during this time and the team was often left waiting for any kind of word back from him. Eventually they were given a deal for funding but not officially made part of the Fanverse, they continued development on the hopes that Scott would make it official. At some point during this there was supposed to be a contract that never got drawn up. Then the whole Scott anti-LGBT incident happened and Scott stepped down, so communications were switched to the new team in charge of the FNaF franchise, who were better at communicating but also strung the Aftonbuilt team along for a while. The Aftonbuilt team had put years into development and hired quite a few people with no guarantee they'd ever be compensated, continuing on nothing but empty promises and a non-existent contract. Eventually, with no real support from Scott or the new FNaF team they cut their losses on what was a huge investment in time and money.
So game get canceled, YouTubers find it and actually enjoys it, the game gets so much interests by the mass.   Publisher: *shocked pikachu face* you wasn’t supposed to do that
Make all of those suggestions of game names reality. Let's see how mark reacts.
Mark: Doesn't read the tutorials or pay attention to directions.  Also Mark: **I DEFINITELY WON'T BLAME THE DEVELOPERS FOR THIS AND THEIR SHITTY CRUSHED DREAMS**
The problem is that ... from my point of view, the FnAF community has become so toxic but completely toxic that it is super obsessed with the characters who create us fan fiction and related games that sometimes don't have anything to do with the game's plot. yes, this is a concept that I have also seen in other types of brands by now not only FnaF, by now I will have grown up or I do not understand the meaning of certain concepts or Horror games ... but the idea of transforming something happy and cheerful into something horrible disgusts me ... and to call it horror a game where there are only jumpscare and annoying and complicated controls that force you to voluntarily lose I don't understand it ... some games of this type seem like a kind of Rage game / Troll game disguised as a horror game.
king of aftonbuilt now
For anyone wondering about the dev's of this demo, there are plenty of reviews with the guys. Scot is shady
You could call it something like Willy's Wonderland!
Funky
Why is everyone writing the same comment “it’s a shame” and “better than security breach” this game somehow frustrated Mark faster than Security Breach… Nothing against the game, it is a unfinished demo after all…
Such a shame this was rejected by Scott. This definitely would have made an excellent addition to the FNAF lore
mark in glasses... srtherqtjfgxhaerghsftyhbrryhnybrbyrv
I love how Mark is uploading more and more normal stuff again like earlier <3
Could have been cool. But still a crock of shite with controls
“What did we do?” “Maybe watch In Space with Markiplier? “I’m like the captain from space.”
mark's failure to remember the forced tutorial of the stuns stating "detonate [whatever the bombs are called] in *line of sight*" is amazing. it took his own testing after several deaths to remember
Mark restraining himself to not roast the game due to the game's problems is so fucking funny to me
8:50 Peep the horror
Mark, king of fnaf, tamer of animatronics.
cool
I love how they brought back eye keypad dude
40:44 I love when Mark checks out demos for games and encourages the developers to keep going
I must say I enjoy the horror content lately
I'm glad hes back to playing fangames again
Thumbnail looks like someones fnaf fursona
Speaking of the Fanverse Initiative, Mark has yet to play One Night at Flumpty’s 3
Mark is the embodiment of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over excepting different results each time.
Me: reads afton Also me: AAAH FNAF REFERENCES
Still under Five Nights at Freddy's 🤣
Sir flubs-a-lot's funfair.. someone make that a game.
Wow you can see the fun he has and that smile during the cut scene.
It is a sad fact that this game isnt approved by scott, they spent so much time and money to this game just to get rejected.
Is it just me or does the bunny sound like mark not spot on but at the beginning
Genuinely pretty irritated that this got rejected by Scott but Im going to support the game anyway and I'm super excited to watch it develop! I really love this game, especially how William Afton is portrayed
Mark: "Lixian, make me funny"  Mark, Lixian is an editor, not a miracle worker 😕
Marks like who’s a good boy 😂
I could make a joke about how the movement reminds me of Karlson, Oh you don't know what karlson is. karlson is a little game that dani is working on it's currently the 12th most wishlisted game on steam so wishlist it now gamers, but i won't
That game is cool- where can i find it 🤨
Was rewaching Marks 2020 youtube  algorithm vid and this got suggested so it has learned
Is the main character secretly Hank J. Wimbleton ?
laftoni baloni, the best name ever
You know Flumpty’s 3 is a game
E
MARKS WATCHED THE OFFICE OMG
Runs better than security breach tho
Mark: “I’m not a bastard, I would NEEEEVER shit on someone’s crushed dreams!”  ~ Wade Barnes has entered the chat ~
Mark: No checkpoint, restart level all over again.
Love markiplier
There is a video explaining why this game 'did't make it' it would've but Scott said that he wouldn't fund any farther and more stuff that I can't fully recall
37:58 Mark saying "hewwo" nearly gave me whiplash
Laftoni baloni😂
Sun = A
I love how the character is basically drawn how all the fangirls drew "vincent" back when no one knew what purple guys actual name was XD nostalgia incoming
Love how mark skips the explanation of how to play the game and then gets mad at himself when he can't figure it out
I'd absolutely love to see the story developing behind this, and how the sick twists Afton has play into it lol
Someone please make a sir Flubs A-lot game
dabadee
Are you going to do One Night at Flumpty's 3?
Probs to lixian for rearranging those letters so well that shit was funny.
reminder that if security breach wasnt such a mess, this probably wouldve made it into the fanverse sb completely ruined scotts outlook on more "experimental" games it seems.
it's not bad, i just think it needs a lot of love to actually be something, also, it sounds like it could be really repetitive
So uhh, did you forget to look at the objectives?
Laft0ni Bal0ni
Let the fnaf flame die out. Games done been milked dry
Watching everyone praise this game while Mark is having the most frustrating time of his life just doesn't quite add up
I’m glad you still play it even though it’s unfinished, it looks like it would’ve been awesome!! (And better than security breach for some ppl :p)
WUBS WONDERFUL WORLD
The KING of five nights at Freddy's 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Oh god im spotting the ALS marketplace movement instnatly  Edit: Yeah this game is just one big asset flip, i can see why this was rejected
I coulda sworn Foxy was glitched at the end there. Why is he all tame after Mark impaled him with a scooper like 5 or 6 times?
You're great at figuring stuff out.
Aftonbuilt different
i love fnaf
lol
Cool
Purple guy 🟣 🩸🔪
You know, I thought he was being really respectful of the author until he shouted “crushed dreams” six or seven times… geez dude.
I like how the main character is wearing a mask the whole time. Definitely a modern FNAF reimagining!
Dayshift at Freddy’s, maybe?
If you're looking for more games to play, you could try Billie Bust Up. It's a musical 3d platformer that's still in development, but the demo is available on steam!
I've never been this early in my entire life
ironic that the fan game scott shot down is miles better than security breach
after seeing the blue main character model, i can guarantee that game is made in unreal 4-5 and its using advanced locomotion system
Bro that switch at 8:46 was a flashlight, was not expecting that at 11 at night in total darkness…
Fnaf is a phase. It's A Lifestyle
Bro mark didn't finish the game he still needs to go to a place in the junkyard he didn't finish the game
AftonBuilt: (exists) Scott: go forward Haters: (make bad comments) Scott: go back Security Breach: (exists) Scott: *GO BACK*  please tell me someone got the meme reference
Yo
Markiplier: “I don’t need any tutorials.”  Also Mark: Proceeds to read about what happened at the garbage disposal in a not so funny confusing way.
Markiplier not understanding that you have to see the bomb to blow it up is very funny.
I accidentally dropped my jolly ranchers down the side of my bed whilst watching and I can't get them back
Use me as a "We need more gameplays of Aftonbuilt !" button.
Hello! Can you play the Mimic on Roblox? It’s a really fun/scary game!
More pogostuck! More pogostuck! More pogostuck! More pogostuck! More pogostuck! More pogostuck! More pogostuck! More pogostuck!
"Aftonbuilt is a surprisingly well made" hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Who knew Scott would turn out to be a MASSIVE asshole.
Well this game seems interesting
OOOOH I SEE HOW IT IS! You’ll make out with a animatronic but not a BUCKET!!! 🪣
I want to see a creator back this and get it finished it’d has the potential to be a masterpiece 🐬
I kinda want them to ditch the FNAF aspect and make their own game inspired by it and finish this game cause it's so cool looking
Laftoni baloni
Wow, I’m actually a little disappointed this got rejected. Oh well, still awesome.
Shame Aftonbuilt didn't make it but I respect Scott's choice
Definitive proof that Mark will love any dog, even a terrifying scrapped mechanical one that's been possessed by the enraged soul of a dead child.
In case anyone was wondering, the game was rejected by Scott on account of it being deemed 'Too ambitious and risky' of a concept, so he didn't believe it would succesfully complete development.
Imma be honest, they should scratch all FNAF shit. You got a solid start for a game and I don't even think it has to be a horror game, just like the music, the ambient everything it's really could I could see a parkour game, a shooter or almost anything with this layout
I've been watching Mark since I was like 5 and just got my first paycheck, so im using my first earned money to subscribe to my long time favorite youtime
I was waiting for when the KING would tackle this.
The game seems interesting, but the thing that keeps questioning me is how foxy is running all 4s with a hook being one of his 4 paws?
Im not late
i think most of us are getting tired of seeing the Fazverse style games. its time to start thinking of something new and innovative for players.
Watching Mark come up with alternative titles is like watching a genius at work
I like how mark totally didn't process at all what the ipad told him. "We should destroy the animatronics! But we need to use the enviroment!" so the whole missions to close the flood gates was to drown the "feral" foxy after you took the 6 tamper locks off... Also he totally ignored the mission window that told him he took them all off already :P
mark I love your videos!
*Ngl, scotts tots sounds good,*
Mark is being way to nice about it. It was denied most likley cause the game is just functional broke. Graphics are awesome, story seemed good, but the mechanics are just flat out broke. Developers need criticisms too know where they need to improve at.
it’s a shame this was rejected from the fanverse, truly a lot of heart and soul went into this. meanwhile security breach gets a 40 dollar price tag lol.
YAH BOI THE KING OF FNAF FAN GAMES IS BACK
They mislabeled Louisiana on the map, my immersion is destroyed
Someone is gonna see this and make an actual Laftoni Baloni horror game. I can't wait.
man. with some polishing about game mechanics like parkour stuff to escape the animatronica. and some debuging the game would be bery fun and interesting.
This looks so much better than security breach, what a shame they cancelled it
I like how afton is very charismatic, that’s why afton got away with stuff in the books cause he could talk himself out of it. Great choice!
😱 finish it :U
Lol, I love how excited Mark was when Foxy stopped attacking him. And I really like how Foxy looks too.
The fucking "Laftoni Baloni" killed me
Can you play omori
Scott really did the creator of Aftonbuilt dirty, if this game was to be finished then I feel like it would become one of the best fnaf fan games, might even have turned out better than The Joy of Creation
What the number for the cops ?!?!?
Wow. great to see the first new FNAF game since 2018.
This is such a cool concept!! I really hope the developers make this into a full game
Ksp
Scott's Tots sounds like porno no one wants lol
I don't like that
Hey mark have you heard about the fnaf fanverse fnaf + it's a MORE SCARY FNAF
Mark should play No One Lives Under the Lighthouse
Mark needed the tutorial,
You're more fun than a ball pit filled with candy.
6:35
To be honest this game would be amazing prequel to security breach about how afton came back. And maybe even help security breach to be scary like a Real fnaf game
This is a VERY well made game
I feel like Laftoni Baloni is going to become a meme
marki maybe some suckerforlove ???
I love how Mark never used the Lights they gave him to stun him into Scooper range. Which would've been super helpful.  Or do any of the other objectives.
I'll be honest, this story is already 1000 times better than anything Scott's ever written.
I love how the Freddy Dummy literally _is_ Drippy in-game. From the description of how icepacks had to be used to keep the animatronic plastic models from overheating (which would cause them to melt and the plastic to essentially drip) to the physical model. Mark's face when he saw that basically described my reaction. fun coincidence
Chica in the backround: 🥲
his footsteps sound like hes made of push poppers
Aftonbuilt is simulator to security breach
no one: Mark: L A F T O N I B A L O N I
‼️RED ALERT‼️ ‼️RED ALERT‼️ 🚨MARKIPLIER OPTED TO DO THE TUTORIAL🚨
You're more fun than a ball pit filled with candy.
(looks at thumbnail) What did Springtrap do to that poor Doctor Octopus tentacle?
ONAF 3
Supposedly, Aftonbuilt was rejected due to the models not being able to "sell enough merchandise".
Play “Jollibee’s” it’s a fan made fnaf game
To me, it seems like there is too much in this game, and it takes away from the fun and scariness I think. What I like about FNAF is that you're put right into the middle of the action right off the bat, and of course the tension builds from start to finish. With this one, I think there's too much you have to know and understand before you get into the actual game. There's a tool wheel where you can access all the different tools to use which is cool, but I think for a FNAF game it doesn't appeal to the average user. I think most players will agree they like FNAF because of it's heart, and being such an original arcade horror game at that. Not really because of the complex, in depth mechanics of the game. Actually, now that I think about it, that's just what FNAF was- it was a game with simple mechanics that anyone could understand right off that bat. I guess at the end of the day that's what went wrong here: it became too complex trying to do to much that it overloads the average user with things they need to know, and that takes away from the experience, because now you gotta remember all the mechanics instead of being immersed in the game, making a pretty concept into something kinda generic. All and all, it just tries to do a lot, succeeding at some, but not enough to get a good enough grip on the fun, if you know what I mean. I think that's the main reason Scott didn't support this one through and through. Fun should be prioritized!  I agree with Mark though; if the game wouldn't work as a FNAF game and they're really passionate about the project which I'm sure they are, they could just rebrand it, changing some models, and make it something that's not FNAF, and maybe it could work better that way, appealing to more hardcore gamers!
I swear I've seen this before today. am I a fucking time traveller!?!
Man i wish i new how to make a game I would make laftoni baloni for sure😂😂
Thank you Fnaf man. Very cool.
I think Mark had the right idea about trying to "rebrand" this. How about instead of Animatronics powered by Human Souls, change them to Mutant Cybogs! Part machine, part human or animal.
Hell yeah! Finally mark! I wanted you to play this for a long while
scott donated money he made from fnaf to trump and other republican political figures idgaf if he didn't like this being made he can suck my ass
that final got me offguard so bad
Yesssss new fnaf viddddd
I really really wish Mark and other youtubers would stop this dumb joke about not reading tutorials
Part 2?
Oh, when a cool fan game does it it's "That's a cutscene full on cutscene!", but when the studio holding the rights for the official instalment of the franchise does it it's "Did they run out of budget?"  I mean, yeah...
this game is phenomenal, and while it needed some polish in a few areas, im sure it wouldve turned out incredible. Its a shame this wasnt funded (and when it was, very poorly) and this is even more amazing when you consider the team made this from their own pockets. I really hope this game is made its own franchise someday-  As for the actual movement, its just a lil off because its a demo, and i think much of the weird feeling comes from not having an animation of climbing/vaulting (think mirrors edge), which would probably have been part of the final game. if these visuals were to have made it, im sure the movement would translate better and feel better to use.
Scott was such a fucking asshole with the development of this game. Poor developers. Everyone holds Scott on this giant pedastal unable to realise he's not that good of a dude, hes not an angel like all the fandom makes him out to be.
He's, as Ethan would say, crupisfied
I’m so sad this game won’t get finished, it’s basically everything Security Breach tried to be but better. And William’s in game dialogue is really interesting
This was by the developer of Final Nights! No wonder the level of quality and polish is so high! It's a genuine shame that this was rejected, especially since we're waiting on most of the Fanverse games still anyways, I hope someday Scott changes his opinion and allows Jeli and the rest of the team to come back to it.
Most boring fnaf game
Love the drawn comic book stuff, plus other all this is a real good fan game, as they usually are.  just needs some more work. Also love poocha ❤️
I love how Mark encourages people to try out making their own games.   This game looks like so much fun!!
i love you
If you need a reminder that you can make a horror game out of anything and it doesn't have to animatronics, there was that sound based horror game which based its monster off of Michael Jackson.
Man that foxy
It was honestly painful to watch for several reasons It's sad it will never be completed
Waiting for Forewarned with Bob and Wade
Maybe Scott could reconsider if the game gains enough attention from both the fanbase and dev?
watching this video just encouraged me to work on my overtly ambitious game
Anyone remember Boobs Makenzie? From when markiplier played yandre sim? [sorry if I spell anything wrong]
the little _bluhruraroo_ objective sound effect is SO satisfying. scratches a good itch in my brain
Someone PLLEEEEEEZEEEE make a Warfstache based animatronics game based around the intercative warfstache animatronic videos mark did. taht thing was creepy and cool af, and i can just see Warfstache making a FNAF style amusment arcade filled with a lot of different Warstache-atronics based on each of his different ''disguises'' and some new ones, that would be pretty effing creepy and cool too. I would, but have no idea how to make games, im just an idea guy, and i dont think 'idea gy'is a job, at least i havent found any way to make it one yet. anyway, *someone make World of Warfstache a thing!!*
the devs of this game went unpaid by scott for a long time before he rejected their game, if I remember correctly if you're making a fnaf-esque game, please please please try your best to make it on your own and sell it for profit, you deserve better than scott taking the earnings
damn this is such a cool-ass concept. such a pity... :[
this is irrelevant but when he said "jump scare warning'' at the beginning of the video my dog literally scared the hell out of me, also ive never clicked so fast on a video in my life
I feel like we need to give a round of applause to the editor for swapping the letters around in the beginning to match the crap that came out of marks mouth🤣
A damned shame Aftonbuilt didn't make it. There was so much potential here, but apparently it was too much of a risk for Scott to take.
I love the eyes on the Hand-unit: almost like the cores from Portal 2!
3:48 the place could been called Wilson’s Museum
So, the short version, as far as I understand it, of why Scott turned this down, is that Scott wanted the animatronics to be way more marketable...
probably isn't a smart idea to talk to a rotting corpse of a child murder
fnaf king returning???🤩🤩🤩
Sus
Did markiplier voice act in the game?
*Aftonbuilt fans when Henrydestroyed fans walk in*
I have to watch this
Nothing lives under the lighthouse is a sick horror game that u should definitely check out
SO FRUSTRATING
I'm going to ask this in the comment sction because I have not found any answers online, and what better place to ask it than the comment section lol. Well my question is: Does Aftonbuilt have a settings menu? I want to play myself but my computer is trash.
I would have loved to see this game get finished. Hopefully the creator decides to pursue something similar in the future
Honestly, considering Mark was using 1/3rd of the game's mechanics, he did very well lol
I see why it was rejected at least... The effort, passion and quality is definitely there, it's just not put to it's best use
i know this isn’t the same game but does anyone know when fnaf plus is supposed to come out? thanks u:)
What does Mark see at 19:20 -19:24 I can't find it, I've been rewinding for about a minute and can't see anything.
gud gud
If nobody makes a game with Sir Flubs-A-lot's Funfair or Laftoni Baloni, then I'm going to be so disappointed.
For those who don’t know, Scott launched the Fazbear Fanverse, which was intended to allow older creators like FNAC and Popgoes to collaborate and sell merch under the fnaf name. Tons of aspiring new creators saw this as an opportunity to pitch their ideas to Scott and have him fund their game’s development, including Aftonbuilt. Long story short, it took a while, but Scott gave the devs a small portion of the money they asked for, but a couple months later, he backed out on their deal out of fear that the game would be badly received. As terrible as this sounds, this game was developing at the same time as Security Breach, so Scott’s fear after SB launched is not unwarranted. The sad reality of Aftonbuilt is that the creators were not prepared to finish development without Scott’s oversight, and it’s not really what Scott was intending when he launched the Fazbear Fanverse. It’s not as if the Indie Horror genre belongs to Scott and only Scott, the game can be anything you want it to be and that’s incredible! Future devs planning on joining Scott’s initiative should consider finishing their games separately first before they consider collaborating with Scott
I love how the character is basically drawn how all the fangirls drew "vincent" back when no one knew what purple guys actual name was XD nostalgia incoming
Play one night at flumpty’s 3
and now there is gonna be a sir flubs-a-lot fanfare game and a laftoni baloni palooza game 🤣 this is the power that mark holds
Hell of alot better then the fucking turd that was Security Breach.
Don't worry there was a jump scare.😁
Did anyone else think their fire alarm was going off? Just me? Ok...
I'm back Markiplier to see you next surprise you got I'm always amazed to seeing your videos so it's good to be back
mark knowlingly skipping all of the tutorials and then getting pissed when he cant figure out the mechanics correctly is just a fnaf game tradition at this point lmao
Ayo man
Is it just me or has Mark seemed off in the last few of this playthroughs/videos he's done? Like the Poppy one was really cringy and then the Devour one seemed like he was sort of ignoring everyone else most of the time.
I like how the game emphasizes that William was a Businessman in life, both in the plot and most of his demeanor throughout the game. Combined with the solid voice acting, this iteration of Afton is pretty good.
This game had a very rough development. Glad 2 see u playing it
UNUS ANNUS
I actually really like this. Too bad it won't make it to being a full game.
Dormítabis please mark
That was funny
i really enjoy marks rant about ideas of making games like the average viewer is a game maker
part 2????????????????????????????
Markiplier doesn't have fire alarms or somthing, it was beeping and I though mine were going off
This has a lot of potential for a dog-oriented animatronic game.  After a corporation's endeavor to create animatronic pets failed (perhaps due to children getting hurt), the robots were scrapped across the country. One person, someone who loves robots, ventures out to these scrap yards to salvage, save, and repair the animatronic pets. Unfortunately, many of them are damaged and react violently -- the "horror" aspect of this game -- but this person is not deterred! They do whatever it takes to get the animatronic under control. Then, they bring the pet back to their shop and repair it, and once it's fixed, it becomes a part of the person's home.   A wholesome horror game.
Props to lyxian for making sense of the what mark was saying at 3:47     I can't 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chika is now jealous of marks new robot dog
"see, that's what i'm talking about. that didn't have to be fazbear fright, that could've been any strange building -- you name it whatever you call it like... uh, it-- it-- i wanted to call it like mickey's pizzeria  but i don't think that's gonna fly. you could call it-- um-- scott's tots! yeah, thats... thats also... thats from the office. and also scott cawthon might not like that... uhhhhhhhhhhh.... siiiiiiiiiiir.... flubs-a-lot! sir flubs-a-lot's funfair!  and for some reason it's on fire and you've got to.... you've got to go in there and get something out of it.  instead of aftonbuilt, you call it fatonbuilt! you call it... tonafbuilt! you call it ontafbuilt-- onfatbuilt. atfonbuilt. you call it baftonuilt. you call it la-- laftonibaloni. _LAFTONIBALONI! laftonibaloni's laughapalooza._ BOOM! you've got a game."
This is the best dang fan game I have seen with the visuals. If you look over the main character
I love five nights at Freddy’s fan game
Nice of you to play a fan-made FNAF game. Look forward to more in future.
This is brimming w/ potential. Defiantly finish the project
atfon bafton ilt laftoni baloni
Shame this wasn't finished. Mark has so much integrity too, not being super critical due to the bitter end of thsi game... If everyone was even 1% more Markiplier, it'd make the world a much better and less depressing place.
Hey guys,  wanna play some  Laptoni Baloni later , It's a new game i saw it on a Markiplier vid
Man aftonbuilt had potential and man no wonder why Scott wouldn’t like it
I love how, even with the bugginess and his occasional jokes and gripes with the game, Mark still gave it a valid chance, tried to be supportive of the developer's aspirations, and had his own fun with it. Mark's gone on record to say, don't be afraid to create, and has been a huge inspiration for so many of us. I hope more small fan games get the appreciation they deserve, no matter who it's from. 💗
"I mean, it's like a storyboard for a cutscene, but hey… a storyboard!" Yes, it's already up to Security Breach standards 😁
Can I have some money mark
*chewing sounds*
Is that the laftoni of 87?!
Love that Foxy gets friendly :') <3
That the game is so poorly coded that controls respond less than half the time and sometimes stop completely, might be why this game was "denied"
Lol
I honestly wonder if the flop of SB was why this was rejected like Scott didn't want a fan game to succeed where he failed
I can't believe Mark got the good ending on a game for once
It... looks good. And that's about it. I can see why it was rejected.
William Afton becomes American
I have nothing to say, its seems a good game.
him befriending foxy in the end was so adorable
Markiplier has a crazy obsession with FNAF, and its great
see so like I love mark and everything but I really think if hes getting mad at the game because its not going his way that he should  read the directions since that wouldve made it much easier if he had used the motion activated lights that stun him
Markiplier: “I don’t need any tutorials.”  Also Mark: Proceeds to read about what happened at the garbage disposal in a not so funny confusing way.
HIIII!!!!🫶
Little Skerm…
sup babe
it was rejected coz Scott thought it to be too ambitious for a fan game
Laf Toni Baloni does have a ring to it
For a demo it looks great, the controls need some work but as mark said, it could of been anything not dealing with fnaf and it'd still be decent, hopefully they ppl who made this demo see marks vid.
A damned shame Aftonbuilt didn't make it. There was so much potential here, but apparently it was too much of a risk for Scott to take.
Yo, it's ok Mark. Let that anger out of the Demo lol 😂
You should play "it steals" it's one of the best horror games right now and it's quite a unique experience
Scary game funny Mark I liked this video yes!!!!🤮😱👍😅
Nice
What a really good fnaf game that can inspire and bring a new wave for the fnaf franchise!!! Scott: "Is it Marketable?" "No-" Scott: -Cancels it for being "risky"-
2:58 it was probably a guy getting springtrap from the burning restaurant fron fnaf3
That game does look awesome!
AAA
Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome to Laftoni Baloni
Mark's transition from fear to awe once the foxy dog becomes neutral was so wholesome somehow
120 hours at phillepes establishment.
Laftoni Baloni
I'm so glad Mark did a video on this! I've been a fan of Aftonbuilt since the beginning and I'm so glad it's getting the attention it deserves from Mark himself :}
"it was a joke" said Markiplier and millions of other prank youtubers after it bit them in the ass
Its okay to criticize the game, they need to learn that these things they put in either dont work or arent good and needs to be worked on for the next game or removed.
Dang it mark your making my fnaf phase act up
I just want to commend Lixan for the amount of editing that afton word scramble took XD
I know this might’ve been said millions of times already, but it’s crazy how an unfinished fan game is better than what Steel Wool could produce with a huge budget
I hated all the other long boring game plays of this game, but mark makes this game more entertaining 🤣
This fr looks so good, it's so sad to see it not make it into the Fanverse :[
Hope u play more when the full release is out its so fun to whach u play it
7:05 da ba dee da ba die
If this is deemed too ambitious then SB is surely extra mega ambitious.
this game has a really big potential bec of Scott rejecting the game makes it more interesting
what did scott say about the game, for makr to be like "CRUSHED DREAMS"
Mark My friend thinks you would look hot af with a mullet. If you ever grow a mullet ( I like all your hair styles) but if you grow a mullet I will find you and cut it off ( I am a barber ) free of charge
mark please play dayshift at freddy’s
Hey
Game: “Explains how to power cord leads to the button.”  Markiplier: “How I get to button?”
I like this vidio
"Maybe it's line of sight based?" "WHY DOESN'T IT WORK"
I wish this game could be apart of lore because it’ll teaches us more about Afton as a person instead of just a kid killer
What mark said is completely true tho, fan games are cool to see but if you have a solid idea and concept you can totally make an animatronic horror game without slapping fnaf in it Wasn't there a super successful animatronic game called Case or smth? From what I remember it had nothing to do with fnaf and it was still sick asf
Well he always comes back and we might have so many questions
Yyaayy
hi
When need a petition to finish and put this game on steam
Its a good day when Markiplier plays a fnaf game
Que the fanf music
I feel like this could have been such a good game, and not just a demo ): the creator was really going somewhere ):
i think this wouldve been a rlly interesting way to fill in the gaps of what happened to afton after fnaf 3 and how he got out of the fire. also establishes the idea of him being on a sort of flashdrive which is a nice segue into the vr game??? rlly cool stuff
nice an early before the mil views
I don’t know too much about FNAF, I’ve seen the main 4 games and maybe 2 fan games. I’m stunned that Scott didn’t accept this game. Yes it’s different, but to me it looks massively more interesting and spooky and engaging than any of the other games ever were. I think the “risk” would have paid off for Scott.
Mark why are you still using the fnaf 2 office well I mean you are the king after all 😂
This is great needs to be finished
Kinda sad how idiots would get rid of dreams that were legendary.
You deserve a hug right now.
7:05 Da ba dee da ba di
12:18 Book readers and lore knower's ear just perked up
Misread the title as AftonButt
YES
Man I reckon marks right the devs should take this away from the fnaf universe and do their own thing with new animatronics of their own cause it looks like it could be really great with a bit of creativity and some tlc
id pay money for this game
I love the thumbnail and that you checked this game out. The thumbnail gives me nostalgia and I deeply appreciate you giving your own opinion and insight about it. Love your videos like always and keep on going, because the road can just keep getting better at this point
WHO'S A GOOD BOII😍😂
Why did I laugh so much at Laftoni Baloni??????
People in the comments don't get that the reason Scott rejected Aftonbuilt was because it was made to be sold and profited off of. There was no passion, they just wanted to sell something to Scott. Plus it was too ambitious, and would need a crazy high budget.
That art in the beginning for the cutscrean was really nice. But maybe get some more life in it ? Srry not much for that but love it :3 but guessing it's a new creater and well they did great
HE FINALLY DID THE INTRO AGAIN! 😆
Why was this game even rejected in the first place?
A demo of crushed dreams... Anyways keep up the amazing videos Mark
mark: "kay, mission accomplished. i think everything's good and i don't have to worry about anything at all. we did good, guys. we did it. ...... what did we do? ...... i don't know what we did."
Just saying. I got very very interested when I saw the thumbnail. 😏
Wow that's cool
It’s amazing that Markiplier created FNAF all by himself
The item menu in this game seems to be infuriatingly bad to navigate. And i dont see any reason why it has to be that way.
Built
39:01 Foxy: :D
Ive heard the story of afton built, this is one of the projects that scott ignored through must of its development, then dropped
More FNAF FAN GAMES
His footsteps reminds me of octopus tentacles
lol come on haha
Lol 0 deaths
I love how foxy went from a fast demon to a good pup to an unexpected jumpscare
Fields of Verdun and the battle has begun
I think it was crucial that Markiplier played this game for multiple reasons. First off this game was in development for more than two years and the developers were creating the game for free to eventually show off Scott with no funding whatsoever. After such a long process Scott denied the game thinking it ‘it wasn’t good enough’ for the community. I feel really sad for the developers of this game for all the hard work they put into the game just so Scott could deny them and the whole community turning against the game itself even though it is a good game to be honest. This is a big win for the developers of the game because now since Mark is playing it the game will receive some light and people will find out how wrong it was of Scott to not fund these developers for their hard work over the last 2 years. Enough said.
Mark: I'm blue  Me: I'm blue da bu de ba da
nice
In an ideal world the developers would have been able to make this into their own original thing, but it unfortunately looks like all the original assets they created for the game were FNAF related. To salvage this project, they would need to completely redesign the dog animatronic, as well as the Afton-themed equipment and a lot of the props around the map, which are animatronics or piles of them.
I've seen many people play this and I'm very excited to see mark play it
Mark: "Lixian, make me funny"  Mark, Lixian is an editor, not a miracle worker 😕
Gee that AR Pad voice sounds familiar
A wonderfull yet horrifying concept Shame it didn't made into scott box
Clause 87 hmmmm? Sounds familiar.
Better and more polished than security breach that’s for sure
I think that like a full fledged fixed and full version of this game would be awesome
Nice to see the king playing FNaF Games again.
top 200,000  les go
I guess Poochy is not the type to forgive easily. Lol!
it’s a shame this was rejected from the fanverse, truly a lot of heart and soul went into this. meanwhile security breach gets a 40 dollar price tag lol.
hi mark.... again... ily.......
this where it gets wholesome: 38:47     HE BEFRIENDS FOXY
the reason a lot of these games are based off of fnaf is because you probably wouldn't play it otherwise considering these are pretty unknown creators. its better exposure for them. not all of them are like this but a lot are only fan games because of exposure.
If you bring up the tool wheel and look to the left, it shows your objectives
Can you please play Tell Me Why, it's a story based game and it's really good
Could you play One night at Flumpty's 3? its parts of the Fan-verse, and is really well made.
it has better leaning then r6
I am SO SAD. this is so incredible i wouldve absolutely loved to see this done full fledged 😭
i had watched the video where he made drippy right before,  I love this
whoa just saw dawko play this!
This game did have potential, and it's a shame it got rejected. Really cool game.
when you don’t look at the tutorial:
This was fun
Great video! Now that you checked out the game that didn't make it into fanverse you should play the ones that did. There's a great FNAF Fanverse game called One Night at Flumpty's 3 which is one if not the best FNAF fangame. And it's completely free! It's very different from design standpoint and has a lot of cool game mechanics. Try it out, it's very fun!
mark is a gem to this world. His ideas and content is simply amazing
Hi
laftoni balooni laftapalooza
I can understand why it was rejected BUT a completed version would have been neat, it’s strange seeing afton so like….human
Markiplier is actually playing a FNAF fan game? That's like Jacksepticeye doing a video where he's not yelling.
Love the plot here, Afton? Amazing character for once! So much dialogue and development! Thanks for putting the spotlight back on Aftonbuilt, Mark!
Is that the Nifty Mother Fucking Table VEVO Yeah?
hi
Hi
this is canon to me
No wonder this garbage was rejected. Half the time the game doesn’t even work. Good work Cawthon
Tag yourself in the concept cutscenes I'm the driver
I want "Sir Flubs-a-lot's Funfair" to be a real game now.
im gonna be honest its an absolute shame this game didnt get finished, yet it had so much potential. Basically Fnaf SB but way better than SB even did!
Do outlast revisited
bruh
I think the biggest reason people make fan fnaf games is because it is easier to build off of pre established lore than to make your own entire franchise especially if its a similar concept to fnaf
Oh this game or one like it would have been awsome plus give some better reason for the whole argon virus
The intro of the game was dope.
Laftoni baloni
I would love to see Mark play a new season of oxygen not included.  Last time he had trouble with the rising heat. Maybe an ice planet would be fun.
I’m kinda mad at Scott for the way he treated the devs of this game tbh it’s such a cool concept. Too bad it didn’t make it into the fan verse, it would’ve been better than SB for sure.
I’d love to see more of this
A lot of interesting game mechanics
3:48 quick bit of lixian appreciation, you did that very well
Interesting video
17:27 as a Kentuckian, I’m slightly miffed that it shows our location as “the Memphis Pyramid”. That’s in Tennessee, not Kentucky
Mark becoming *somewhat* friends with the Foxy thing at the end is a twist I don't think anyone expected
Afton isn't British?
Why is the Foxy bot so cute 😭💜
Im upset jumpscares dont hurt me no more
Yeeessssss I’ve been waiting for you to play this I love the junkyard foxy a great birthday present for today
Hi I liked
e
Yes, Laftoni Baloni
"I think I need some tutorials!" Oh no, Mark's starting to learn...
Several times when he opens the tool wheel it shows objectives and he just never looks at it
I love the eyes on the tablet moving like aftons eyes are actually moving when he talks
0:03 different
Mark says you can't use Mickey Mouse, but give it a year and a half or so, the rat's protection expires then and Disney has been told they cannot renew or extend it any long. So very soon, the mouse will be in the public domain, and it's gonna be wild. Pooh Bear and his crew entered the public domain about... 2 or 3 years ago.
Love ur Vids mark they are so cool to see
fazbear frights are the books, fyi
awesome saucing
4:11 mark actually create a new charm🤣🤣🤣🤣
The editing at 4:00 was unreasonably amazing.
You’re my friend now!
i literally had a dream like a year ago about five nights at freddys characters in a big warehouse that looks very similarly to this and i think im a prophet
cool
Security Breach but better :(
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🟥
Fnaf games fnaf games
Opening theme slaps, I have nothing more to say
Scot cawton doesn't like change if it is better, he likes shitty gMes
Yup , all these names Mark just said will now be made into indie games
Yes!!! Finally, this game is getting the attention it deserves! It was rejected for... Quite honestly bs reasoning, and an agreement was made between the two studios that they would not profit off of it, which... You know. It's disheartening. Anyways, I think it's very nice that you've brought the publicity it needs to it!
Those storyboards rock.
Interesting, interesting...
Shame the developers won't finish this now, the concept is great, even if you remove FNAF from it. Hopefully someone takes this idea and turns it into something that can actually be sold
Was this the Faftoni of 78?
7:04 🎵 da ba dee a be daa and aba dee aba daa and aba dee aba daee🎵
You know, since you have infinite supply of the detonations, they had to save up on the transmission system at least, so they used the TV remote IR sensors and transmitters.
Crazy to me how this doesn't get funded but Security breach does😂
Very cool
How does this look better and is less buggy than security breach despite being probably less than 8 months work
I love the stereo that was playing RM  mono audio i think it's so cool!!💜💜
Bring back Drunk Minecraft! Gmod prophunt/TTT! 7 days to die!
The beginning cutscene heavily reminds me of that one scene or extra in the first Cars movie where everything was drawn, I vaguely remember a drawn scene of mater?
j (enjoy existence while it lasts mark, your end will be coming shortly)
YA KANSAS , FINALLY ON THE MAP.
Yessss FNAFFFF
please play baldi's basics plus!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡 the update 0.3.7 came out so please markiplier i beg you to play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m so sad this game won’t get finished, it’s basically everything Security Breach tried to be but better. And William’s in game dialogue is really interesting
You know someone out there is already plotting to make a “Sir Flubs-a-Lot’s Funfair” game.
Upsetting to see this game not going to be finished.
Saw Afton and IMMEDIATELY clicked to watch it
Man, I absolutely love Mark just like "this does NOT have to FNAF themed! If you have an idea, and you can make it, make it" it's just so wholesome
day four of asking you to play Detroit become human but not pressuring you to do it
why is louisiana labeled mississippi on that map at the beginning
The idea here is quite nice. Hope the dev takes the idea in their own original direction with a spiritual successor to what Aftonbuilt was meant to be. Although I could see this as being a proof of concept and without funding they might be quite limited. Well, here's hoping the dev behind this goes on to make more cool stuff at least.
This make me remenber the mark's van
Laftoni Baloni was the funniest part of this video no argument 💀
THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED YET U^U
man really creative title mark keep up the good work 👍😂❤️
why does the guy in the intro look like fucking Hank Wimbleton
Alternative title: Mark tries to not shit over a demo game when it’s bugs keeps on getting him killed.
I tried plating this, I spent 30 minutes optimizing it after finally finding the file where I could see the settings because its literally just those 3 options for them. My PC is SO terrible that I couldn’t run it at the lowest settings where i could read/play the game normally.
Bing Bong Table, Wam Bam Chair.
Hi Mark, hope you're having a good day!
You're supposed to activate the bombs with the cameras.
I thought the title read AftonButt
Isn't William Afton... british?
My name is Afton soooo this is weird for me to see my name as a title for Marks video 😂
Mark you should play Oxenfree!!
This seems really cool! Do u think ur gonna check out ONAF 3?
its too bad this game was never finished :/ it had so much potential and seemingly great cutscenes! (if they were ever finished)
Thanks for enlightening my day. Like always.
cant wait to play the demo of laftoni baloni
I appreciate Lixian and the editing team for editing the name suggestions at the beginning
9:35 - I so wanna see a Drippy FNAF fan-game!  LOL
👍
I'm so glad Mark helped get this game the attention it deserves
This was too much of risk for Scott to take and yet security breach was only known as a buggy mess
I heard of this game for some time, the game is amazing, but seeing you (Mark) play it makes it even better.
MARk AaAAAAAH
who else would catch a suckle on marks markitiddies :D
7:05 Da bo dee da bu daiii be da bu dee da bu daiii!
tlou 2 lets play when mark
As everyone else said, this game getting cancelled is extremely stupid. I'm still holding out hope though.
Another reason why everyone needs to read the instructions
Can Scott like... pay these people to finish it anyways?!?! I mean they did spend like what, 7 years on it?!?  Scott rejecting it because it was TOO creative is complete bullshit. If you don't want it part of the Fanverse, fine. But now people who enjoyed this game INCLUDING MARKIPLIER can't see the full game EVER. Not only that but surely you just crushed the devs dreams. If I was one of the devs, I'd have severe depression right now, reluctant to start any new projects at all. Explains why it'll never be finished. Why I'm not seeing any sort of Kickstarter for it is beyond me. Tbh at first Scott came off as jealous. But the real reason was the project was too ambitious??! You know what was too ambitious Scott?! SECURITY BREACH. The story was great but the execution was out the fucking window for most people. Even Mark came across a shit ton of bugs.   Scott just looks kind of hypocritical now. I'm very disappointed with his judgement.
A
I’ve never heard of this game, but it looks INCREDIBLE!
Marky moo if you pin this i will give you a cookie no lies :)
To be honest the cut scenes are very creative. This could of gone virtually if it had its own concept
I love Markiplier’s videos especially the FNAF gameplays! I hope FNAF games continue being made, fanmade or not I want to see more!! 👑
why are you not playing the last of us 2 ?
Hey it's foxy!!!!!
It was prolly denied because the lore didnt match up
Lets play some Laftoni's Baloni
Honestly wouldn't be surprised if this got rejected simply cuz it was better than what Scott could come up with. This is a brilliant concept, and let's be honest, security breach, was anything but, especially with how it was executed
i’m basically with mark on knowledge of this game, but i’ve heard great things about it! i just hope he plays fnaf plus when it comes out, i’ve been keeping up with the progress on that and my god it looks fantastic!
Laftoni Baloni has me shaking and crying rn
None of these comments have finished the video, let that sink in damnit he's cold outside
This is a perfect game with a great vision
Am I the only one dying at laftoni boloni 😂
so cring how the gacha comunity made a whole story about fnaf's
my love for your work hasn’t changed in 7 years, man your content is  just ✨muAH✨
Thanks for all the bots YouTube really adds texture to any video.
Mark!! could you play the remaster of five nights at treasure island?
It's funny to watch Markiplier struggle with this game while he's trying to stay positive for the sake of the developer
Please react to the omega mart commercials and the new Mandela catalog  vol 2.
I feel like a lot of what was missing from security breach is found here. SB didn't feel much like a horror game at all, this has the actual dark, creepy atmosphere that (most) fnaf games have. Also the body horror aspect of fnaf was completely lost in SB, not saying that fnaf needs to be a gorefest but having the small visual implications that a human is dead inside an animatronic suit goes a long way to make the games creepier
Omg it uses the default Advanced Locomotion System skeleton
THAAA LOOOORE?!?!
*skips to the end of the video*
"Babe wake up Markiplier just made another fnaf video"
>doesn't do tutorials >"What do you want me to do" If you lookup ignorance and arrogance in the dictionary, Mark is in both definitions.
WHO THE HELL IS DRIPPY, DOES HE MEAN DRIPTRAP?
There’s something about the character being blue giving me Murder smirf
I heard of this game for some time, the game is amazing, but seeing you (Mark) play it makes it even better.
Hi Markiplier!
Main character looks like Hank Wimbleton lol
Markiplier's next next next NEXT encounter with springtrap
AYO MARK DID U SEE THE NEW CHAPTER OF ONE PUNCH MAN?!
I think a lot of people think that fan works are inherently less valuable or like not as good. If someone wants to make a fan projects its not cause they don't think they can make a full game. It means they want to make a story in that universe. The same for fanfiction or any other fan project. Fan works are just as valuable as "fully original" works.
yo  mark are you ever gonna check one one night at flumptys 3?
"Lukpy badumpy"
WAIT. HOLY SHIT, this is such a wonderful game concept and I wish this was finished. Dude being controlled by afton, finding out lore, sneaking back into burnt building snd dealing with all of the older and probably newer animatronics would be a dream. It could turn into trying to build him a new body, or stopping the creation of a new facility seems like a dream. Just to he portrait by him at the end, just like the ennard(or maybe not like ennard because it's already been done lol). Though it sucks..This could've been great..
20:25
.
Amonugus fnafpfaf sus Marky huh??????? Yes? Maybe ○-● Hank  If Hank comment this I'll do "go mark yes" or "amongus mrurnky" zkwmpqqkaoaamxjmfjvwpqqojsssisssksks
Ayo 31 minutes ago?!
What a shame it wont be out huh..
7:05 Markiplier after chewing the funny cool gum in the Mr. Beast Wonka Factory
Note: (I assume, not sure, but) This was meant to be a continuation of the Final nights series, but not directly. It's the same world, same creator, but different MC.
If you want something else to play but is horror you should play Amanda the adventurer
You know that when Mark plays a fnaf fangame, it's going to be goood
Thank you mark! This fan game needs more eyes on it. I hope more attention and traffic allows for the game to be finished in the future.
It was rejected because it was based on FNaF characters and Scott didnt want that, he wanted things like Candy and Humpty.
Heres to hoping Scott has a great movie coming for us soon :)
Oh hell yea borther!
Where is the last part to Sucker For Love?
it’s weird hearing William so…. Docile? Negotiable? Easy-going? It definitely makes him seem way more like a person than anything in the canon games
Memento mori
Isnt the first bit the dude stealing springtrap after fnaf 4?
My hometown is called Affton (pronounced the same) so it was cool hearing you say the name!
You have to play One Night at Flumptys 3!
The animatics for this game is where security breach said “yeah that’s good”
Mark's always saying stuff like "if you have a great concept, just go and make a game". I've been writing this crazy horror for years, it started as a movie, but developed into a game BUT MY COMPUTER CAN'T EVEN RUN DISCORD FAM
my pop big
FNAF? Five nights at Freddy's? Freddy Fazbear's? Woahs
Does anyone want markiplier to play one night at flumptys 3?
earliest ive been wowowow
very saddening the game didn't make it :[
Marks Blue dababedabada
mann I wish this was finished
Aw hell naw, Marked Pliers gonna more-lest da robobibots.
Someone please make a horror game called Sir Flubsalot's Funfair.
OoOo This looks interesting! Let’s take a look  I hope you had a terrifying time Mark!
Woooo! Can't wait to watch this!!!
Exotic butters
17:00 Thanks for making it funny, Lixian.
Your voice vibrates my whole phone Mark 😂😂
OH WOW!!!! some of my friends worked on this game holy shit!!!! its so crazy to see mark play this knowing that..
Looks a cool game. Shame about it not getting completed. Glad you played it Mark.
Markiplier Scott tots lol 🤣🤭 omg
FNAF 2 OFFICE THUMBNAIL
👍👍👍
😀😄😄😁😁
everytime i see markiplier play a game, I'll never forget the time he so perfectly put together the entire fnaf franchise in 2 seconds        *''ashton''*
Any US Office fans are proud of you rn for Scott`s Tots
I read the title as aftonbutt at first
Amazing!
2:55 I see what you did there…
I still wonder, where mark gets his idea's from.
I love how he said he doesnt want to play fnaf ever again in his first fnaf video and continued to play literally every single game fnaf releated ever
1.6kth!
* gasp * im early!  uh *yes fnaf*
Mark: "Fazbear Fright... Is that based off of FNAF 3?" Alas, the king who knows not of his own kingdom
Interesting I watched a video on this game like a month ago
OH MY GOD! Is that Vanesa who Mark is playing? That would make sense
Personally, I am very excited for Laftoni Baloni's Laugh-a-palooza
I wanna make a pitch but I'm not the game dev but I like to spit ball ideas... So new name :atom-bilt Park name: parkers parlor and friends. New animation: broken Parker New company: baker robotics Inc. Player name could be atom. Atom is a theft who has been working for his boss for a wile, he got fed up with him and decided to go roge, sent to steal a...strang robot called Parker from a burning amusement park, he escapes the premise hanging up on his boss to a safe house of his, (the tutorial here), but when he comes back only to find... a voice, a human voice coming from his computer, he has so many questions but no time to have them anserd. It tells him he needs to find robots, robots infused with some thing deadly, the voice tells us . And teaches us how to stop and capture  them bring them back to the safe house for "matnece". Thro out the game we are forced to find theas robots (each with its owne name and location) Some abandoned, some with a new look, some still running its tasks with the danger dormant....all the wile trying to find off his old implores goons. Throughout the story we find notes, SECRETS even revealing the story slow , telling us about the robots, the victims how some blinded by the appeal of immortality and ever lasting beauty...met a grim fate worse than death. Some of course, wer "reluctant" and required some "persuasion". We learn the story of a man know as Dr.B Throughout his notes, as well as victim notes and police records. A man driven to the edge of insanity  by a great loss of his love. Set out to cure humanity of its greatest plague...mortality. slowly slowly after experiment after experiment he finally come to the revelation of what he had to do. he had to turn to robotics. He had acquired test subjects, the first a young boy sick and dying of a chronic disease(now a kids entertainment animatronic), the second a woman obsessed with immortality (now a abandoned entertainment bot with the look of a fox), the third a man wanting eternal youth (turned hideous, demonized, a monster), and many more the docto set to work but as he worked he started getting slopy. Soon the media then the police, one after another they finally found him in a last dish effort to escape he hooked him self up to a machine, and killed him self...but not before transferring him self into the machine but some thing went wrong, traped, tortured ,stuck in his own mind he waits for years...finally to escape.... BOOM done
25 MINUTES AGO YUSSSS
Who remember “Ashton”?😂😂😂
Markiplier : “okay… “        Also mark: has no idea whats happening
I’m determined to make a fangame called Sir Flubs-a-lot’s Funfair and the characters were built by none other than Illwam Ontaf   *Sir Flubs-a-Lot’s Funfair*  *Created by Laftoni Baloni Inc.* *Characters created by Illwam Ontaf*
scott better get this back now before it becomes its own franchise
Hey Mark, solid question but was there ever or will the ever be a part 2 for the labyrinthe game you did with Bob and wade
Please do the full version of Treasure Island
3:59 Ah yes, the primary antagonist of the FNAF series, Spilliam Bafton
Dude i would buy this game but only if they Make a compatible with controllers
Loftoni Boloni's Funnest Funfair of Funfairs Funfair sounds like a fun game
This is a really cool concept, really cool. Sadly, I feel like the robots are kind of taken as a normal thing in this world? Like the main character is trying to get Afton back but he is acting as if he has done it before AND IT WORKED. Acts super casual about bringing a dead person back to life... I dunno is it just me? Or does the main character act as if it's their normal friday night bringing back murderers from the dead? Like yes afton says they look "shoked" but then again they just listen to him and go ahead with his whole plan.  Either way I really love it, just wish there would be more "mystery" behind the whole resurecting thing.  PS: Afton is also acting as if somebody has tried to bring him back before and it worked. He knows how to get back to his body and all that and he talks so casually about comming back to life XD "Oh I guess I owe you a favor for that" LIKE HELLO? To me it is a big... yikes on that part. The voice actor is not bad by any means but he is just... too casual about it all.
3:34 I don't think fluber will like that one
eee im early omfg
Hey Mark you should play Tyke and Sons next, its an incredible fanmade fnaf game with a mix of fnaf 4 and Scott's first game Chipper and Sons!
Yo
The dialogue is interesting
Game: “Explains how to power cord leads to the button.”  Markiplier: “How I get to button?”
Can we all just appreciate that this comment isn't sucking up to Mark and fishing for likes?
Oh hell naw who let Hank into Fazbear’s Fright
I love how he was making up names for a fan game. “Laftoni Baloni” made me chuckle and it’s an interesting animatronic name!
Hi!
aftonbuilt
Markipliers videos always cheer me up when I'm down, and honestly I really needed this rn :D
i didnt expect him to play this game, sweet
No wonder Scott rejected this game, it would have made his inadequacy even more apparent
Mark: See, it didn't have to be fazbear's fright! It could have been any kind of strange building you name it whatever you call it, like... Mark: *struggles to come up with an original name*
Bro speaking minion at 13:47
“Is that the REAL Laugh Tony Bologna??” 😂😂
Love you Mark ❤️ been watching since FNAF 1 and I still love you and the content you make
pretty sure it was rejected bc the characters weren't marketable enough, but i could be wrong
A wise man once said, “if a woman calls you gay you shall make her mother pay”
Can you please play 1 Night at flumptys 3 I really wanted you to play it when it came out but you never did if you could that would be really great😁
hi marky (●’◡’●)ﾉ
I actually saw Ryan play this a while back so hope you enjoyed it mark.
I don’t remember the video, but there was a video of a fan made FNAF 3 trailer and the subway (ow whatever it is) looks almost like that trailer. It’s really cool. I wish that it can be completed for others to play fully without it being a demo
I like Mark's relationship with Lixian so much
Here’s how to cancel a subscription with Trubill
This is a certified horror classic 👌
How is he comftorble with coming up to a killer robot
Great game
Bro 1m and 2k views
We need a game called laftoni baloni now
I hope y'all realize what mark has just done. He's dragged this game into the spotlight, and people who never heard of it now know. There's a chance that, with this one video, mark may have revived this game by exposing it to those who'd be willing to sponsor it's development (i.e. Patreon, Kickstarter, etc.)  We could be seeing more of it soon
Did you know the cookies real name is Sid
Looks pretty cool from the thumbnail, already know it’s gonna be an absolute banger
FINALLY
WHAT DID WE DO?? THE ISWM PART!!
oooooooooooooooooo
I honestly haven't watched anybody else play this yet and you make me wanna watch it
yesssss smore fnaf let's goooooo
it is my birthday, may i get a happy birthday plzz?
oooooooooah
early
Now if only markiplier did One night at flumpty's 3
7:05 Dabodidabodie
Drippy doesn't want to kiss you now that he sees your face in the light
w video mark
Scott is not alive any more 😔
Finally, you are playing this game! My mums listening to the last goodbye, BTW beautiful song!
I’m so glad that William survived his fiascos with the Springtrap suit and made more of his own designs
Dead memoriez
I like how the game emphasizes that William was a Businessman in life, both in the plot and most of his demeanor throughout the game. Combined with the solid voice acting, this iteration of Afton is pretty good.
Claim your under an hour ticket here 🎫
this man i scaring me with all of these post
Mark: Lixian, make me funny Me; You already are
Hi mark you are the vest
Markiplier! Can you see me?
man, it’s so good to see mark back doing let’s plays and “regular videos”. not saying i didn’t think iswm wasn’t absolutely outstanding and amazing, because it was and is, it’s just nice to be able to watch him do these types of games again.
Sir yes sir Oorah
mark go bark
Not gonna lie that story bored looked like some DA shit some edgy 16 year old drew up
Bro Laftoni Baloni aftons palooza
Hi Mark
Markiplier what is your opinion on afton built?
Ya'll didn't even finish the video before commenting
hi
Early!
It’s Afty Wafty time! 😈
Ooh spoopy video. Looks exciting
Hohoho
i better wake up tomorrow and see that sir flubs-a-lot's funfair is already available for preorder
So I think what he pulled out of there was Springtrap, aka Willy Afton
E
Nice 20 minutes
anyone else think the guy you play as looks llike hank from madness combat?
Laftoni baloni would be a prediction in the future
Hi
you should revisit Getting over it with benitt foddy
Plz play One Night At Flumpty's 3
This game is great wish Scott picked it up
Just call it night terrors
Hi
18 minutes ago
i love you so much.
I loved the project of the game and Mark playing is always hilarious 😂
Just watched a documentary about Aftonbuilt a couple weeks ago.  Really sucks what happened with it.
You should get back to five nights at candy's.
Huge fan never get to comment on new stuff
markkk!
21:48 the bite of 23
Furst😀
I’m genuinely surprised this was rejected 0-0 The game looks like it has serious potential
slay
If this isn't a build-a-bear game but with animatronics I'm going to be severely disappointed
Markiplier playing fnaf fangames in 2022 just slapped me back to 2016-17 when he used to play fnac and JOC
I think the issue was that they couldn't get the funding to keep making it.
Just got my wisdom teeth out, thank god there’s a new markiplier video out to distract me :D
Dayum wish this was gon get finished
CAN U PLS PLAY FLUMPTYS 3
I know I'm 17 mins late but plz use my suggestion in a video play five nights at freddys 2 in roblox
awesome sauce
THE KING OF FNAF IS BACK!
OH my gosh ive been waiting for this!!! Heck yea!
For once, i am not late to a Markiplier video.
I love watching Mark play any FNAF themed game. These videos just give a certain charm
You played it!
this is actually so cool, I love afton being cool-headed and not immediately “evil”, the game looks amazing so far! Still needs some polish in the mechanics but theres some great potential here
yo
Ooo:O Hell ya
Cool to see Mark play more FNAF games. Just Sucks that the game wasn't finished.
Hey mark i have a question, did you know 9 + 10 is actually 21 as stated from this problem (9 + 10) (base x) = 21 (base y) 9(1) + [1(x) + 0(1)] = 2(y) + 1
Don’t think I’ve seen a vid this early after post glad I caught this early
Was that the bite of 87’?
The game developers have outdone themselves, good job
7:06 BADU BE BADUBAII
Really wish people stopped stealing IPs and made their own stuff.
Cool game idea
Hey mark, nic ejob on this video!😊
I will cherish this video as today is the first birthday I am celebrating without my mum and this has boosted my day! <3 Keep making the world laugh, we need it!
I love you mark 🥸🥺♥️
nice
The game looks absolutely incerdible! Such a shame Scott rejected it in favour of less ambitious projects just because they had more marketable characters
Nice to see Mark going back to play Fnaf fan games :)
i came up a name fore my game concept five nights at scrabbys of course scrabby the rabbit is the main character hes a rabbit with a smile not the same type of bonnie but he kinda acts like him but instead of a gatar he gets a micro phone and actully sings but the audio is coming from scrabbys music box he also wheres a farm outfit and another character i might tell you show me your best concept of scrabby the rabbit i cant do it because im not a good drawer go posted on my channel and put it in the comments and set a link soo i can see it fore myself see you in a 10 days (choo choo)
This game would make more sense if markiplier stayed with his parkour friends at college lol they went here in their next outing
Ooooooooo I didnt expect mark to play this for some reason but I'm glad he has
Before 1 mil views
Yo I’m early ??? 😏😏
This concept would have totally killed it. Damn shame to think about what could have been if it was finished.
i really love how the computer has william’s facial expressions lmao
Babe wake up, new Markiplier FNAF video.
this is sick actually
sPo Ok y
That's really sad that this thingy never made it past the concept demo,really seems like it could turn out like a great fan game,I wonder why the dev never finished it and what caused it to never make it to that fnaf themed thing that Mark told us about in the beginning
I really hope they finish the game, it’s deserving of its own original characters and lore PLUS the devs need cash for all their hard work on this.  Why stay stuck as a FNAF game when you can go bigger?
Nice, I'm here in the first 15 minutes
For the first time I'm 9 minutes late.  FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.
damn! pretty early ^^
Me and the 72 thousand other people being 13 minutes early 😎
Somebody make sure flubsalot fun fair a real game
cool
what did u get the gamr on?
Aftonbuilt  Fatonbuilt Tonafbuilt Ontafbuilt Onfatbuilt Atfonbuilt Bafton uilt Laftoni baloni
its fnaf time
How come no one appreciates Lixian’s editing in the different title thingy Shit’s hilarious
Afton just sounds like an alternate cave johnson
glad mark is playing more fnaf games! it’s been a while and there isn’t much going on glad someone is keeping it alive!!
0:39 Actually I am making my own game, it’s on Rec Room on VR I’ve been working on it for a while now...
Scott ruthlessly rejected this as far as I've heard
The king of Fnaf has returned to his fans. 👑
Hi
it’s weird hearing William so…. Docile? Negotiable? Easy-going? It definitely makes him seem way more like a person than anything in the canon games
Scott is a duchebag who's homophobic and transphobic so no surprise.
Mark: what is this about   Me: uhm fnaf?
dats c- look i just wanna comment early ok
Good luck 👍🏾
I dont get it
This game is nothing like Security breach idky people are comparing them. Honestly Security breach only failed because fans got angry about it not coming out yet and then it got rushed. As well as Scott wanted to retire right after. They should of waited to put it out.
MARK MARK MARK
WHEN THE FUCK ARE YOU GONNA PLAY ONE NIGHT AT FLUMTYS 3 MARK PLEASE GOD DAMMIT PLAY IT.
I’m now ready for a Laftoni Baloni’s laugh’a palooza game!
Buddy got more engaging scenes than security breach
I thought that afton was British
Like 👍👋
Fun Fact: This was the fan game that Scott rejected for the Fazbear Fanverse, still though would have been cool if it was added but I can see why it wasn’t. Glad to see that Markiplier got to play so it wasn’t fully forgotten.
I love that Markiplier is giving advice on how not every horror game has to be FNAF related.  It can be any other animatronic or just a monster of any other sort.  LAFTONI BALONI  6:43 _Confused wheezing_
Love you mark, no homo :)
Yes, I’ve been waiting for him to play this :)
Wee
Me when the early: :)
Did this seriously lose to security breach?
9 minutes
To tell you the truth I don’t understand why this game has gotten so much praise it just does not look good or fun at all to me
Imagine waking up after being burnt alive and half your body's gone
Markiplier is the OG of fnaf videos
The King of Five Nights adding another fnaf jewel to his crown 👑
I’m actually proud of myself, I’m never this early to Mark’s vids  And look at Mark just speaking things into existence like that 0:09 hehehe
The story behind this game is quite tragic. I wish the devs of this game the best because what they made is absolutely wonderous. I just wished that they had chosen to create their own universe rather than slot it within the existing FNAF lore as part of the fanverse, because then they would have simultaneously been able to make money off of it and the whole debacle between the devs and Scott would have never happened, that ended in essentially forcing the devs of Aftonbuilt to cease work on the game.
Early gang
You should check out games by Rusty Lake. They're make sorta horror escape the room games, and it has very interesting lore.
Mark can we get you and the boys to play the lunch lady
I just can't hear this guy's intro without thinking TF2 now

CrypticBuilt
Fnaf fan games are probably my favorite kind of fnaf games I’m not gonna lie
I love this vid <3 I LOVE ALL UR VIDS MARK  See this please <3  Remember that you will be my fav YouTuber forever..
aftonbuilt different tho
Everyone who commented is still watching the game at this exact moment And I think thats beautiful
Ive heard of this game :O It sounds interesting!
The problem with making your own original scary idea for a videogame is that it's hard to get attention your way when you are making a new concept, making it fnaf related makes it so it's easier to get attention, because let's be real here, even if you got a cool concept or game, it's really hard to make people notice your game
Wowie I definitely wasn’t stalking your channel and happened to be early
Unfortunaly I miss the jumpscare cuz I had to make the video full screen in my phone so it got delayed and I'm not scared
Oh my god the fnaf man has made a fnaf video
Mark pls play another episode of yandere simulator 🙏🏻😩
Hallo
Is that Markiplier from five nights at Freddie's
when you discover that springtrap is a pre-build
They deserved better.
Good video :)
They could use an animation in cutsenes but using sketches really makes it unique
Interesting..
In case anyone was wondering, the game was rejected by Scott on account of it being deemed 'Too ambitious and risky' of a concept, so he didn't believe it would succesfully complete development.
Says he wont explain why Scott rejected the game then goes on to accidentally explain why 😂
Is this a new type of five nights at Freddy's game 🥰😍👍😎
I still adamantly request One Night at Flumpties 3. C’mon man.
nice
Mark your cool
My Day gets so much better when Mark Uploads a Video
Aftonbuilt feels like it got caught in the fallout of Security Breach. According to interviews with the devs, they were kept waiting for months at a time by Scott, waiting for info, or confirmation of a contract, funding, etc. Aside from some funding here and there, Scott was largely silent, and when the time came to get a contract signed to make the entire game, Scott pulled the plug, calling it too much of a risk.  This was shortly after the release of Security Breach, and the fallout that came after. It's rather evident that after Security Breach, Scott didn't trust ambitious projects-- after all, if his team couldn't do it, how could an indie team? So the years of work that went into building this demo from the ground up were effectively wasted, which is a damn shame, because Jeliliam was one of the best fan game devs we had, and seeing his first real interactions with Scott go this poorly is a damn shame. This game and its developers very clearly had a LOT of potential, and it would fill in a very big "???" section of the FNAF timeline (the time between 3 and Pizzeria Sim), but Scott just isn't ready to put his resources into a game of this scale after Security Breach.  It's an even BIGGER shame, because so far this rough, somewhat broken, and EXTREMELY incomplete demo has gotten high praise from everyone who's played it.
10 minutes since post
Whoa
Bite of 87????
oh hello mark
So..... who's gonna tell him?
It's so interesting on how there is 1.2K comments already and no ones watched the whole video yet. ITS BEEN 9 MINUTES!!!!
EARY.
truly upsetting
YAYAYA
afton built my as-
oh mark you amazing human
Rather splendid
Scott’s coth😂
this man carried fnaf since 2015
Mark, you should check out “It Steals”. Its an indie horror game that I watched a video on recently and I think you’d really enjoy it!
Laftonis Lafapalooza 10/10
it’s a shame this was rejected from the fanverse, truly a lot of heart and soul went into this. meanwhile security breach gets a 40 dollar price tag lol.
Any video mark posts is worth my time even though i should be revising 💀
anyone know who joe is?
Is that... FNAFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF ??
Afton built should've been what security breach is, I just wish they would finish it :(
I dont think Scotts trash opinion means anything anymore thankfully

Hi early gang
Mark trying to create different titles out of "aftonbuilt" is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time
I love mark playing fnaf games and fan games
Someone really needs to pick this game back up
Somebody should make a fnaf game where you are Freddy trying to get the guard

Mark: Let's play this FNAF game Markiplier: F̴̢̡̧̙͈̹̓͊́͝N̸̡̼͓̦̒͌́̓̀̐͊͛Â̴̞͔͙͎͓̈̑͘͝F̸̹̯̤̪͕̠̩̬̘̮̔͛
.
its amazing that storyboard had better plot development than most disney movies
Just saying that there is a way to kiss big lady nyan in that eldritch god dating sim and to remind you to play 'it steals'
Oh for once I feel early
“i’m blue” DA BA DEE DA BA DIE
Oh my gosh Mark is playing another FNAF fan game, YES!
The all new blue man
This is gonna look like ima enjoy! :D
Man that animatronic was lucky it goatta make out with mark
Lol
can we appreciate lixian for always moving the camera for us to see the text behind it? i know he's been doing it for a long time but it always makes me so happy. thanks lixian, big preesh!
Really cool game
So scott tried to induct this game into the fan verse, but why did scott reject it? What about this game made scott think it wasn't good for the fanverse?
Honestly, Lixian's editing skills are on another level
Earlyy
la fé tone  The French bear tots town
LAFTONY BOLONY
cool fnaf unofficial fan game.
Mark is starting to look like his father its so cute
Laftoni Baloni...Genius
lets gooooo more fnaf stuff
Everyone before playing the video should start from 0:10 seconds
I hope we can get more of this soon
7:06 I was expecting a song reference there.
Daniel (FNAF SB) vs the cooler Daniel (Aftonbuilt)
Bruh I hate bots
I think the general consensus around why this game was rejected was because this game might have been considered too ambitious and might have just gotten cancelled in the middle of development.
Hello mark
Man, the FNAF fandom is getting more and more creative
Mark I just wanted to say that I love your content and that it always puts a smile on my face regardless of how I'm feeling, so I sincerely wanted to thank you and wish you the best of luck for the future :)
Here we go again
Markiplier deez nutz
1192TH!
early bug
how am i so early to this 😭
Omg earlier
Out of every FNAF fangame, Pork Chop's Horror Show, and Tyke and Son's Lumber Co. are probably the ones that can count as stand alone, and both have great story, gameplay and animatronics that, if Mark wants to try it, would be amazing and terrifying in itself. They have enough to stand on their own, and only a few aspects actually tie them to the FNAF world, with different types of gameplay, and even though they are longer games, they are worth it in it's story and jumpscares
This game looks awesome!! Man, I wish it was continued.
im going to make a point to dislike any FNAF videos i cross because scott cockface is extremely homophobic and an avid trump supporter. i do not want to see any content from people who think like him, and i'm sure many of your lgbt fans would prefer you stop supporting scott as well.
LAFTONI BALONI. SOMEONE MAKE IT HAPPEN
E
30:16  Waiting for someone to take this out of context:
markiplier soon probably: “hello everybody my name is markiplier and welcome to laftoni baloni”
Early!!!
Aftonbuilt...
Mark- You could have called it Mickeys pizzeria, wait no that would be Disney Me- *trying to imagine Disney’s version of FNAF*  Just thinking about the Disney-afied bite of 87
Rejected by Scott?  *Lets motivate that with a controlled shock*
YESSS MORE FNAF AND MORE OF THE KING
I think the only reason people settle for fnaf and not make an horror game with different characters or settings is because fnaf already has a massive fan-base and making games for that will get more attention than if you made an original game
Hi
Markiplier never disappoints us :) Literally the best Youtuber on YT right now
cute
6min ago dayumm
Dang, that game looks absolutely epic! 😃😊❤️🖤💕💞🎮🎧
e
Cool
e e e  e e e
It’s insane how Mark has been playing FNAF since 2014 and still plays fan games in 2022, feels like FNAF will never die💙💙💙
Lore
Paw patrol is a secret CIA experiment where they took the souls of children and put them in dogs to test cognitive ability when transferred to a different species. The experiment was such a success that they made a show as a fun little cover up. The lead scientist was Dr.Afton or better known as "Purple Guy" or as the kids know him, the "lean monster".
I missed seeing Mark play FNAF fan games. I think that this is an awesome game
idk i think the Ned Brainard from Flubber wouldnt like that name
i hope he can play more fanf fan games
Markiplier is the best. Whoever says the contrary, WILL, BE, HUGGED.  This is your only warning, comment at your own risk.
Mark
I think I'ma like this one
Someone has to make a Sir Flubs-a-Lot game now
Lafftony Baloney, is that you?!
This is the second youtuber I've seen play this game. (Insert clapping for this man)
This looks great tbh
Number 1131

👑The King of Fnaf👑
“Laftoni Baloni” 😂😂
Bafton build is that where they build BAFTA’s?🤔😆
Five Nights At Markiplier's
1989
I normally don’t get scared by games but this honestly had me on edge the hole time…😱
When you get the notification that Markiplier posted a new video   AMERICA F### YEAAAAAHHHH
yeeyyy
wow
Hey Mark, wouldn't that "Jump In Again" from ISWM secret be in the audio file? It looks like a pig from Doom.
can we all agree mark is the true best youtuber
I am so early. I'm proud
Mark you should play John Doe
Thebworse stuff about bad guys is they think they're actually the good FOLKS
Aftonbuilt different … Sorry I’ll see myself out
The fact that this is like a fanmade version of this fnaf sb,Honestly it has full potential,Hopefully he might Play more of this one day
Reupload?
Back to basics, Markiplier playing FNAF games
worse stuff about bad guys is they think they're actually the good FOLKS
Bro 5 minutes and 30k views 💀
Mark revisit welcome to the game series
Broi finally get to be on time to a video
Puglord thinks its sad how this game (most likely) won't ever get finished
I have seen the latest three scary games before, before it came out help me pls
Sir Flubs-a-lots funfair is going to be lit…
This should have been in place for Security Breach.  Amazing game
🕺
Can I get a hi?
3 MINS AGO IM EARLY LOL
i have a very good game u can make a video on its called the binding of isaac and its on steam
I love how the character is basically drawn how all the fangirls drew "vincent" back when no one knew what purple guys actual name was XD nostalgia incoming
It's a shame this game couldn't reach it's full potential in the Fazbear Fanverse but it's nice to see Mark playing it regardless of it's rejection!
Yuh!
This game could had been like security breach, like your playing as Vanessa and glitchtrap/William Afton giving you objectives on like what to do.  Just sayin’
4 mins ago and 1k comments???
👍❤️
Loving it so far! I think this is gonna be just as great as the rest of your FNAF playthroughs
Never been so early
Welcome to aftonbuild hope you enjoy the ride!!!
This looks cool ngl-
he posted the vid 2 mins ago how tf
4 minutes 1k comments damnnnnn!!!
I thought my smoke alarm went off 💀 2:06
23,000 views and 1000 comments in four minutes... wow
Supperior security breach
amongus reference
I think it's so cool to see the drawn out story board. I think it would be cool to see this from some of the more popular games and see how it went from storyboard to the actual cinematic video. Don't you guys think so?
Here before 5 mins
s jacuzzi h I'll then ok few no fw ufjnt zucchini
the animatics look so good, I wonder what they would look like fully finished
Hiiii Markkkkk! Come to my wedding !!
Five nights at Freddy's jump scares don't effect me anymore like they use to lol I still enjoy them
Love vids Mark keep up the good work
the scariest thumbnail I have seen in a while
Woah 4 minutes ago, thats earlyyyyyy
woo a new fnaf video!! lovin' it mark
I feel like a lot of devs do "fan games" instead of creating their own universes because there's already a market for the game they can release it to. I wish it was easier for devs to get original works out and publicized like fan games
Yay I'm early
Springtrap land
My favorites videos are FNAF games with Markiplier
''sigh'' ''open youtube''  ''watching markiplier newest upload'' ''closing youtube'' ''starting playing fnaf 1 - 6''
I have never clicked on a video so fast in my life!!! I love you mark! ❤️
I watch your videos daily, and then rewatch old ones when I’m bored. My boyfriend jokes on me bc it’s my favorite thing to do lol.
I am obligated to click on every Markiplier video ever
It's been a while since Mark played a FNaF game. I love those.
Ngl this seems like a real game
Ok but like                                                           WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87
Hi, Markiplier! Yay! King of FNAF and YouTube is here! You are the Best! 🌟Ⓜ️🌟💕👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🕊🦋
Cool
00:10 You gotta love Markimoo trying to Jumpscare us like that lmao
22 sec ago?
This is what I need. After getting resin fillings cuz of my sucky enamel and therefore not being to breath through my one nostril, this is nice to say the least.
You should play day shift at Freddy’s too!
When I first saw that thumbnail I thought this was FNAF 2 10/20 mode. Cool reference if it was intended.
Mark I love seeing you play these!! 💞
everyone is beautiful here !!!!!!!!!! (source : truth)
Early 😳
“Hey! story board!” Lol I loved it
This game is amazing! the cutscene was so cool, even if it was a storyboard. goes to show anyone can make a game :)
EPIC

Early gang
Hello Markiplier
woah that's so cool
Love your content it's given me entertainment and laughs for years! I agree with how Indie creators shouldn't be afraid to publish their games.
hey king
Why is there 941 comments in 3 MINUTES LIKE DANG-
I LOVE YOU MARK!! anyways this is really good lol
This is gonna be awesome. Although I've seen plenty of Fnaf stuff. I can't get enough.  I actually saw another channel play this one but I'm super excited to watch Mark play it! Super cool stuff.  (BTW I secretly want to trade my dog for Chica for a day... but don't tell my dog.)
How was Aftons undying potion made
YEEEESSSS
Fnaf :)
Lately I’ve been online on YT just right when Mark released some new video, so I’m always like: “oh 40 seconds ago, let’s watch thisss”
One night at Flumpty’s 3 has been out and I’ve been waiting for you to play it, my life will not be complete until this happens
I'm literally wearing my graduation outfit rn thank you for uploading rn 😭😭💀
More slender and fnaf mark keep it up!!!
Wait, it’s all Markiplier? Always has been.
Nice
I wonder when Mark will stop uploading fnaf content
“And a jumpscare warning”  *Proceeds to jumpscare all of us not even 3 seconds after giving the warning
Oooooh more fnaf
Day 10 of asking Markiplier to play the full version of Janitor Bleeds 😁
Honestly Markiplier made Fnaf Popular
quality content
This game is so good
More fnaf fangames! I absolutely love when markiplier plays fangames^^
Man this game was a fangame made by a small group of people who got the demo rejected by scott, it's a real shame that it had to get rejected since it is really good
1 minute
My notification just came in and as soon as I saw afton I clicked
Just a suggestion… Can you add time marks to 3 scary games videos?
Hey I was just rewatching your house series. Nice.
Yezzirr
Market Pliers
i absolutely love how much effort is put into these fan games. there's alot of love and devotion put into it and it shows well
AHA IM 3 MINS EARLY
Fnof
Well mark. We meet again for fnaf. I am prepared. Lights off. Hiding under blankets. And hoping to God I don't die. Let's do this
Ik i had to sleep like two hours ago but fuck it i will watch my idol and fav youtuber not gona sleep :)
I remember Scott talking about how hard it was to have to cut projects near the end of setting up the FNaF+ fanverse or whatever it's called. Knowing how Scott loves the FNaF community, I bet he wanted to approve all of the fan games.
YESS MORE FNAF FAN GAMES
I was crying but this notification made my night
i've never been this early in my life, maybe i'm about to win the lottery

Sweet new vid!
Been waiting on this gameplay for a while! Love when you play fnaf games!

A damned shame Aftonbuilt didn't make it. There was so much potential here, but apparently it was too much of a risk for Scott to take.  Edit: Good lord. I posted this comment, went to bed and then came back to it having 14k likes and 200 comments in the morning.

I'll enjoy from this video
Sucks that these guys were put through all of this to make an incredible game for Scott to just tell them that it wasn’t creative enough.  Edit: My bad, he said it was too ambitious ^^;
oh boy
I wasn't expecting Markiplier to play this...
