People are afraid to raise children so they just have abortions.
Am I crazy or does it look a lot more like a pentagon
If you want people, I volunteer!!!
5 million in Palestine is not a mistake, it reveals the surrender monkey nazi in the French
Palestinians will love this sparsely populated land.
Ironically this French empty diagonal is becoming a haven for living a better life at a decent cost.  The sad drawback is the lack of medical services, but every where else is turning into a dump with crime and immigration through the roof.
The State of Palestine??? I guess your geography can’t be trusted.
What! Let's bring 100 million Africans.
So the southern Landlock section of that diagonal is not landlocked at all the way it continues through Spain goes right through Madrid so that’s fairly populated. Is there anything in your video that actually is accurate.
💚
Average real life lore vid: make a random area where few people live and title it “why this part of ……….. is almost empty”
The only thing that keeps me in a large city in the US is the better public schools for the kids and more job opportunities. I would love to live in the country and have some land/space. My little 1/2 acre in the city gives me a little room for beekeeping and backyard chickens.  Well move when the kids finish their schooling.
Its not empty .
Both UK and India’s GDP are higher than France, and India is expected to be 3rd highest economy by 2030.
You want to talk about low population density? there is a place called The United States of America that has gigantic swaths of land with 19 people per square kilometer as opposed to 30 per square kilometer in the “empty diagonal of France.  f
In my opinion, Every country should have some untouched, natural land area. It's not necessary to industrialize everything, countrysides are precious
France's population constantly grows and the countryside is constantly being paved over.   Out my window a crane is constructing housing for the impoverished immigrants in France.  The land was farmland, but not 20 acres gone for ever.   That food is gone forever.   If there were no less dense areas, the pollution around the big cities would be even more deadly with diesel fumes and more people would have lung disease starting younger than ever.   Human population density lowers the quality of life.   India and China are hell holes as are Pakistan, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Nigeria, Columbia.....  Too many to mention.  Then the mathematical handicapped spout nonsense about underpopulation.   Too horrible to be funny.  You are too horrible to be funny.
Living in south west part of France, in the Pyrénées Atlantiques department and I’m roughly 30min from the Pyrénées (which are freaking beautiful) and from the nearest beach. And add that to fact that it’s clearly not overpopulated around here ? That’s a dream place to live in !
People really enjoy listening to this voice?
Twice the USA bailed out France in WWI and WWII.  France Arnie is a joke twice they let Germany walk over their country
There is no such thing as the English Channel, at least 50% of it is French, so, at best, it should be called the Channel
Les Toulousains à qui ont dis qu'il habite dans une zobe vide 🤨🙄
I've been through that area. Quickest way to drive to Barcelona. If you live there, you are blessed. It was beautiful
The most pointless waste of time dedicated to video.
The State of Palestine at 2:47 ?
0:11 Identical in size to India? India is 6 times bigger than France. Spitting false information within the first 15 seconds of the video, makes the rest of your content unreliable.
I live in the empty diagonal and I love it. Less crime, less expensive, more nature.
Ouais ouais jsp ce que tu dis Le seul Truc que on append en college (en géographie) c'est la guerre mondiale 1 et 2
To me France looks like a pentagon due to the bottom not bieng complete and yes the 2 bottom side are diagonal but it still looks like a pentagon
2:50 Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Europe is dirt poor but pretending to be rich. Why?
This is the perfect example of misleading people with statistics unintentionally
You could do this with most countries.
Holy fuck this guy can yap
So does no one live next to the bay Biscay
please dont do this thing when you go offtopic in the end
I feel like this could have been an email
I think the trend will start to partially reverse as more tech jobs go remote. Smaller towns and cities with more open space, natural beauty and more importantly cheaper prices will attract younger people. Crammed cities are depressing.
9:14 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
French military: 8th in spending, first to capitulate. 😉
France needs more immigrants!!!
Je veux habiter in "empty" France!!!   I love the French countryside... it's like non other!
Vive la Lozère !
To be fair, 90% of most countries are completely empty.  All of humanity that lives today wouldn't fill the Grand Canyon, and the entire world's population could all live in North America with room to spare.
(Palestine is not a state, nor is it inhabited by 5M people. less than half, actually.)
dosen't he know palestine in not a contry and that the "palestinians" are not actually a real nation???
…be right over
It seems as if one third of France is empty due to historical and geographical reasons.
Vesna
Oh my God, I am so happy to hear that. Everybody else thinks that France looks like a hexagon too I thought I was the only one and I thought I was an idiot for it.
I wish all Of France was empty. I wish a certain mustached man had been able to do away with  them like he had planned.
As an American I say Germany is better than France!
France: 60% of our population lives in 60% of the country! What's up with that population distribution?  Canada: Hold my beer.
Great love to visit similar to Canada
I know that the US also has an empty corridor. Does anyone know if the UK also has an empty corridor?
FEWER workers...
I get a little bit smarter every day just because I watch real life lore
'state' of Palestine? If only...
Why is empty? Bcuz it's empty!
8:20 Dover cliffs on the other side of the channel 😁
Palestinian is not a statr
Crimea IS NOT RUSSIA IT IS UKRAINIAN
I also live in the "empty" area of France.  It is magnificient!  I want it to stay like this too...but sadly, I think people are realising the virtues of 'country' to 'city' or busy coast, alors- people are trickling back.  No sm@rt city wanted here! Incredible quality of life here!
Many states in the USA have similar uninhabited open land.  Texas has miles of country, ranch land, mountains..etc
it is not empty...it s just without humans...
Oh, you made a little mistakte there. There is no such thing as a "state of Palestine."
bro can draw a line through anything
"france is major power for century" also france in 1940 :
This guy can draw a line anywhere
Mountainous regions are always empty
My grandmother lives in empty france and I love it! So peaceful
The waffle house has found it's new host
Weird thing, the only time I have ever heard anyone refer to France as l'Hexagone is when they are explaining why France is called l'Hexagone.
the city of Lille? you mean Rijsel!
The notion of the feedback loop really applies to hyper-rural areas of France, but there is a political issue at play. There is constant political pressure to reduce spending associated with the expansive welfare state, and one of the big expenses that is frequently cut is rural administrative services, like small hospitals or post offices. Add to that the fact that country doctors get older and retire without any successors, unprofitable train lines are left in the dust or outright closed by the SNCF and you have adminstrative and medical "deserts" forming. That being said, you also find people who leave cities to live in the countryside, either because they can commute or work from home, which poses other problems because they sometimes clash with local tight-knit communities (who see everyone not from their village as "hors-sein", or outsider, something I have seen myself).
*5:10** germnazi BURN IN HELL forever...*
I was born in that zone and lived my childhood in it. I had to move (for work obviously) and when you keep living in that zone, you struggle to pay everything even if everything is cheap because no work, no opportunities. So yes, for tourists or people from big cities it's nice to come or to buy a cheap house but if you actually live there, it can be so hard.
Is there any french person that studied this in 9th grade ?😂 Le programme d'histoire de 3ème dans une vidéo anglaise mdr
As with so many of these videos, the answer is "Because you drew the line that way"
I appreciate the named country for Palestine  Thanks
Wembley math was wrong
Ah les bâtards ils parlent vraiment de la diagonale du vide mdrr
The empty space looks like a foot
I live in the 40% side, and we actually study this problem in class, me likey
I'm having flashbacks of learning about the diagonale du vide in high school...
i live in the middle of this "empty void", it is awesome: -housing is cheap, i have actually 110m² housing surface, a 70m² garage and 300m² garden and that for 120k€ -it takes 4 hours to reach switzerland, 3 hours for paris, 5 for the oceanic coast and 5 for the mediterranean -we are far away enough from paris (french people will understand and like this one) -during covid we lived a dream here, i live in town (big enough for various food delivery) and i still had to WALK only 5min to end in a forest -now in winter 22/23 with "energy deficient" i heat with wood, and that also is cheap af here (53€ for 1 m3) -and bonus, if you like motorsports, roads are great, often empty, and i have acces to 4 racing tracks all less than an hour away
mountains, wildlife, and agriculture, that's why it's "empty" ... still there are cities in it, (a lot) quieter than paris of course
It’s no different than New York State really. My county has just under 50,000 people and 2,000 in my village. We thrived with factories in our golden days since we were on the Erie Canal but they’ve all closed down or moved. Now farming is the dominating profession and most people commute to larger cities like Albany. That harms our local economy and younger generations move for college and more opportunities. I did that, but am looking forward to a new job back north so I can get involved in protecting our historic buildings and landmarks.
So untrue
No one want to live there, I mean it’s France
How much of the United-States territory is "void"? This vidéo is so much Bull sh...
American say this? like we say in french, csc
May i add that france is absolutely not the same sise as india, france is not a tiny country but small in comparison to india
Sah,quel plaisir de voir la france
Since small part of Turkey is in Europe. France has 4th largest population in Europe.
1:55 It's a small city called Auxerre, I live here !
tbh when i see the action of the globally "impactfull" countries and what france did when it was on top of the world, im happy our global power is in decline
I used to livr in lozere for a bit and it’s honestly so beautiful but there is nothing except in Mende, the prefecture.
fun fact when you talk about the war : i am the first kid on my family too know my father and uncle since the war of 1870
I'm going to live here now
8:45 Nope, the French government never tried to fix the issue, in fact, they even worsened it through decades by centralizing everything in big cities, like reducing local taxes, making small villages struggles to get a good infrastructure.
As a French, could say that it is the most beautiful part of the country, those landscapes are just to good.
Where is gernobole?????
You should know,there is no State called Palestine
La « diagonale du vide » est aujourd’hui remise en question par les géographes français, d’abord parce qu’elle a été mal comprise, ensuite par ce qu’on ne peut pas dire que ce modèle soit scientifiquement solide.   Par exemple, la miniature utilisée peint une grosse zone en rouge allant du Nord-Est jusqu’à la frontière espagnole, or dans cette zone il y a Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand et le Creusot, éventuellement Reims, et on s’arrête à la frontière entre le Luxembourg et la Belgique : c’est assez étrange de décider qu’un tiers d’un pays doit être considéré comme vide si dans cette zone on a de l’activité un peu partout là où l’on peut en avoir
5:40 love the fact that he pronounce Marseille, Lyon, Lille perfectly but then say PariSS xD
J'habite en banlieue ça doit vraiment être incroyable de vivre à 5 minutes d'une forêt j'arrive même pas à le visualiser
France is the the only country made by the rules of god
C'est à cause de la creuse ça
Maybe that will become a chance in the near future. When a collapse will happen, we may be more resilient with less people per square kilometer. Easier to feed, easier to live together…
Aaaah on parle enfin de la diagonale du vide
Because fuck you, we do whatever we want! 😂
so empty for you, and so full of life for us :)
2:46 Didnt know us had a 51 st state
One of the proposed solutions was to build factories in the diagonal. Really cheap cost and at the center of the Country.
Next episode: why 99% of Australia is empty
there toulouse in this zone and that a great city
That was very interesting
This video should be 3 minutes long. The answer is most people lives by the coast.
In france we call this the « diagonale du vide »
They need space for agriculture ffs 😂
You miss a point,  the women problem. Almost all women left the the countryside because there is nothing to buy (clothes, accessories and other useless things), no women -> no kids.
Les américains ne connaissent vraiiiiiment pas la France 😂😂😂 la vision de la France de napoléon ahah, De Gaulle a bien travailler 👍🏽
Diagonal 🫡
Damn this guy never got in france for say thay  Bri ish i bet
Next video: Why is Tibet so empty?
Il a vraiment mis Toulouse et les usines Airbus dans le « vide »
diagonale du vide
Well remember a Big part of Africa was french. This IS also a reason why there is less people than before
we do be living in cities doe
I live in that empty zone. After going to Paris for 1 month, i can guarantee you that this empty zone is really good, its so called
Day 3684135 of someone reminding me that I live in an empty place
I'm really glad you talked about my country with such good informations, facts, comparaisons. Everything is accurate even the prononciations 😅
The "empty diagonal" Is very important for us, it's mostly used for farming wich is necessary for a country's economy, population...  And we also have very important key placement of nuclear centre in that area to collect electricity ;) 🇫🇷
I live in empty canada and I relate.
Pas de problème. La République jùîve de France va nous combler tout ça avec des africains.
Empty spaces don't cause trouble providing passers-by respect your privacy.
I am happy france is talked about  My country is cool 😎
I live in lozere. The prob of encountering a horse is greater than the prob of encountering a human
You can’t talk about France’s demographic problem in the XIXth without mentionning the criminal Malthus.
It's kind of funny though, thinking about this kind of stuff. It makes me think about video games like civilization. Thinking strategy of where countries would try to invade another country and where that invaded country would be best to put their effort into defending. For example I've always played as Japan in the game Civilization, I have never lost a game. Because I always had control of alaska. And even when I would start to lose, I would just go into defensive and hold off Alaska and let the opposing forces on all sides drain out their resources. But in real life it would be very different as Japan kind of acts as a first defense from a Chinese or Russian invasions of America. Even being its highly unlikely Russia would try to invade westerner north America as they are similar to Canada but opposite. Built along the borders of neighbor countries but less populated in the east and harder terrain to traverse. Now they could try and avoid that completely and follow their northern coastline east and invade northern Canada or Alaska. But in the end they would never be able to get ground forces through our northern harsh terrain fast enough. And this is why we have not seen ww3. And not to metnion if Canada and America attempted to invade russia on russia east we would face the same fate as russia invading Canada and Ameriac at our north. Not to mention the nuclear threat. And I tell you right now, it would be China or Russia who would start it. Not North Korea lol. North Korea would end fast. If north korea dropped a bomb on any Country. Their country would not exist anymore, unfortunately surrounding countries would feel that pain as well. Not to mention all the innocent people in north Korea who would not have deserved it.
This reminds me of here in Canada as most of our population is along the border of America. Kind of crazy thinking about it, our population of all of Canada is almost the same as Tokyo alone lol. And we are a massive country.
you delimited very bad the area : the basc country is very dense and very touristic
Not empty, too many people elsewhere  ?
I live in France ,this is why i am happy that you talk about this intresting subject donc merci beaucoup
I live in the diagonale du vide.  Pros : Cheap housing most of the time, lot of nature, very authentic (way more than Paris)  Cons : Hard to find good jobs. The center of small cities is dying. Lack of things to do outside nature  Some départements of the diagonale are pricy now in the Southwest (Pyrénées-Atlantiques and Landes) while some others places are dying in the Northwest
Because we don't like people.
Why 3/1rd of France is empty for a french ( me ) 1. Theres big mountains like The Alps , The Jura , Les Pyrénées 🤌 and more. 2. Racism. 3. Macron is a lil b*tch 4. Idk
France is Europe 3rd most popular country ? I wonder by what standards was that calculated.
i dont live in the empty france, i live in THE GHETTO WSH WSH 93 OF FRANCE and i NEVER KNEW ABOUT THAT EMPTY SPACE WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
« Due to its unique shape »  Well… tell me two countries with the exact same shape and size 😑
Stick the refugees there then sorted ......
they test nextgen weapons in there
Same with Spain. 40% empty
C'est pas la diagonale du vide ca
0:11 nearly identical in size to India? Are you kidding? How did you get this information? Looking at a year 1990 world globe? India is 1/3 of whole Europe
Does he actually answer the question? I got bored with blah blah blah
In France we call this "La diagonale du vide", which translates to "The diagonal of emptiness" in english.
Hello, i live in Lozère, this is beautiful place :)
The size of France 1/6 the size of India, not equivalent at all.
This is absolutely not a problem for France, in this void diagonal, we have forests, mountains, cattle farming, etc. Also if in the next decades we have population density issues like in alot of great city, we still have alot of lands. This void is far from a problem
Because it’s mostly mountains. Voila, solved it.
What you are trying to demonstrate is not very rigorous.
France is not nearly identical in size to India! Its 6 times smaller!!!
You are wrong, search again about "empty diagonal", "la diagonale du vide"! "Empty diagonal" is not there!
I just read about about USA empty empty spaces....
I live in “empty” France. No complaints. I wanna keep it like this. Pour moi, c’est parfait 😊
Y'all need to get over the fact that boarders, coastlines, and rivers boost population. The interiors of countries are often deserts, prairies, mountains, or otherwise UNSUITED TO HUMAN LIFE.   Life only happens where there is food, water, trade, and warmth. That's why the western half of the US has only 20% of the population. It's mostly desert, mountains, prairie, or nuclear test sites.   No good for people, much less giant cities.
Because they got plenty of spare lol nicer better warmer nearer sea etc etc so just the highlands of Scotland or Iceland or Lapland they are empty , next stupid Q !
I'm really wondering why this is supposed to be curious.  It makes total sense that there would be empty gaps in the country, particularly in the middle inland area.  Not really that unusual.  I'm pretty sure you could find something similar in any country that has areas that are too mountainous, too arid or far from the coasts or any good water sources.
You almost pronounced Belarus correctly 😂 1:40
2:44 Palestine isn't a state
Palestine is not a State.!
30 people per km2…..still sounds too crowded
Anomalies exist in minds of overzealous "researchers". They should more observe the world than try to impose their rules of reality.
This happens everywhere. People want to live: a) near coastlines, b) on the more level ground, c) near good supply routes (which much tend to follow naturally governed by topography, and d) near other people.
What the fck was the expression at 9:15?
You can find out why 1/3 of France is not occupied by skipping 2/3 of this video.  Fckn youtubers lol
is the ocean coast line only or any major body of water ie the great lakes or caspen sea
Absolute bull shit.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....as boring as their movies and wines...excel in the strategic retreat aka ignominious surrender .holding on to and exploiting  african resources and people..ruining south east asia for a century with diabolical abuse and torture..at the pinnacle of it all ...phony pretentious culture of design and culinary excellence..and ridiculous assertions that one competitor in the tour was doing anything everybody who finished in the first hundred wasnt..there are many thousands of american service men and women buried in france ...who died in two wars to free the french and euro peons from one another and themselves..the frencch conjure  every excuse and facade to belittle them and the u s in an attempt to hide their shame cowardice  collusion with the enemy and ridiculous butter brain blunders in both.
And the loosers still scream "OvEr PoPuLaTiON"
Paris looks like Aleppo with scattered art installations LOL, no wonder everyone who visits is extremely disappointed
Almost empty?   ...it sounds inadequate
They liberalized first. Liberalization is a killer for birth rates
palestine is not a state by any international or legal standards. also, 5 million people only if count the Gaza strip, which is controlled by a different group of terrorists than the west bank
C-F être comme <<suis-je un joque à toi?>>
The world's population is WAY too large .
This is one of the most sanitized, white washed versions of French history I have ever heard. No mention whatsoever of the French Reformation of the 1500's which resulted in Catholics persecuting Protestants which not only caused a lot of deaths, but also resulted in many Protestants fleeing France. As a result, France sowed the seeds of anarchy and ruin which eventually resulted in the French Revolution of the 1790's. France to this day still stands as the only country in recorded history that through its legislative assembly solemnly declared there was no God. The French are still reeling from this to this day. Is it any wonder France's influence in global affairs is not what it used to be? How can God bless this wicked nation that spurned the light from the Protestant Reformation and had the blasphemous audacity to declare there is no God?
how can you make a historic video about france and not once mention colonialism and slave trade?
This type of video can be true for other countries (Spain for example has really empty spaces), not for France, you have to consider mountains, and rivers when you do this exercise, they play a major part in France demographics, and they are not really mentioned here
If I lived in France I’d want to live in the empty diagonal. Quiet, peaceful, surrounded by nature.
Lavoûte-Chilhac, Auvergne, France, is a perfect example of this. I went 20 years ago and was astonished to see what looked like a large town but it only had 272 inhabitants. Most houses were empty.
Sorry to much leadup bullshit,
I really don't understand why you keep making videos that suggest that rural is bad. Not everyone wants to live in dense urban areas. We still need nature. We may not act like it, but we need it.
At 0:16 there's a representation of a french breakfast and they nailed it just by finding the girl in the middle who looks the most french I've seen in 23 years of being french
All the top 14 rugby teams are located in the void.
This is incorrect. There is Toulon and Bordeaux on southern portion
So informative and insightful. "Demography is destiny," for better or for worse.
Worth mentioning the Massif Central being a large part of that area too... kind of hard building large population centres on top of granite mountains!
Being French and living in a big city I actually just want to move back in this empty diagonal
Let’s consider the same issue with Russia ;D
I live right in this area next to the 4th biggest and richest city in France (Toulouse). I have no idea you included the valley of the Garonne in this, up to Bordeaux, apart from high speed train, we miss nothing. There are plane every 30 minutes to Paris.
Good: we need emptier spaces.
3:45 3:55  movies names?
I don't know if I'm the only one but France is not a hexagon. It's a PENTAGON!
Text is hugly manipulative, not the slightest inspiring to think.
Their elites will flood it with africans and arabs once the larger cities have achieved white minority status
Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
In France we call this the “diagonal of the void”
Thanks captain obvious, the country side is less populated than cities 👍
They are just surrendering the territory in case Germany wants to invade Spain.
Hollar!! PALESTINE 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸!!
The crazy keyboarding temporally face because lily neurophysiologically flower beneath a well-to-do banker. voiceless, unhealthy dust
very well.. how about sweden, 2/3 of sweden is almost empty
I LOVE the emptiness of my area, and just an hour from Bordeaux.
I don’t think France is as big as India unless you count overseas territories lmk if I’m wrong
Good. Let everybody move to the city! Give me rural country with even less people!!!!
10% of Frances male population died in first word war. In Serbia it was about 50%. Imagine that demographic catastrophe.
7:40 LOL, there is a lot of "Empty Spain" but it's not at all where you painted it. You threw in it some very densely populated areas: Southern Basque Country (incl. 1000 in Bilbao metropolis) and even Madrid itself, a monster metropolis that hosts almost 20% of the population of all Spain. It's not like those red blobs were so hard to spot, were they?
together we can make 3/3 of france empty
Palestine isn’t a state.
France is very lucky.  I live in England and it's so over populated it's a joke.
One side is not land locked
Compare this to Australia now, more than 90% of Australia is empty. Majority of their population lives in just 10 cities.
I think it is laughable to say the diagonal is "almost empty" when almost the whole of the western US plus Alaska are far less densely populated. One could just say that this area is largely agrarian, thus fewer people, like all agricultural areas.
Paris is the most slinkiest place on Earth..  Just edging out Liberal cities in the States.  Oh..... and they hate Americans.
Camp of Saints. Immigrate and replace.
4 minutes through the video and the actual cause isn't mentioned yet?! No thanks.
🇬🇧Mr ANTONIO Madril MARCOS is best,recommending him to all beginners who wants to recover losses like I did
france is odd
Presently about 40% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast. As population density and economic activity in the coastal zone increases, pressures on coastal ecosystems increase.
Since you took the example of Lozère, I went there on vacation and honestly I don't know how it feels to live there all year round but during vacation it is so quiet and beautiful, there are a lot of little mountains and at times when I was observing the pines over the river I felt like I was in a national park in Canada, and also since there are a lot of rivers you can jump from bridges into the water that's amazing !
The name of the land is ISRAEL.  With all the research you do, it is obvious that you are deliberately spreading Left wing anti-semitism.  The land of Israel was conquered by the Ancient Romans who murdered large numbers of the land's INDIGENOUS PEOPLE--THE JEWS--before expelling them.  Then they renamed it 'Palestine' to add insult to injury.  After which it was colonized by outsiders, who now call themelves 'Palestinians' .  You are deliberately supporting COLONIZERS and discriminating against the descendants of indigenous groups reclaiming their land.  Oh wait, I forgot, Jewish people don't count, because those who fled to Europe look "white".  Then again, neither do the Jews who look "brown" or "black".  You don't count any of us as people.  All your "Woke" ideology is one big lie.
you mean 3/3?
A friend in America retired to Central France in this area mentioned. A small town with quite a few British ex-pats. He bought a 200-year-old house for 30 K, remodeled it, loves  the town. Shhh don’t tell anyone.
Why u compare area to palestine there is no state carid that name
Don't act like England's population density isn't entirely centered in London hahaha!
How is France nearly the size of India???? India is more than 5 times the size of France
French men are smelly and French women have awful hair grooming habits. 😂
Almost every one of these videos is “you might think it’s the mountains or desert but the really answer is a lot more complicated”. Turns out it’s mountains or desert.
Thank you for including the state of Palestine in the video!
fantastic ...loved the facts... scrap the piano... great maps
I'm sure you can fill this empy land with Apartment blocks to house 100,000's of thousand more refugee's and economic migrants!
common france L
France is nothing but a bully that has obtained its wealth by theft of the resources of Africa. If it was not for the forcing of 14 former colonies in Africa depositing most of their money in Frances central bank, this wicked country would be broke
England is full and getting fuller every week. Towns and countryside. No politician is willing to slow it down.
Serbia lost 16% of its entire population in ww1 60% males, ww2 pretty much same , the most then any nation in the world
dumb.
Also, if it is more viable to buy apartments and leave them empty, instead of renting and making some additional income, maybe the issue needs to be looked for somewhere else: just consider the risk associated with renting the place. Non paying tenant could easily squat the place, stop paing rent and their bills, while doing it within their legally protected rights, landlord is legally obliged to provide for them as long as the apartment is occupied, until the eviction takes place, and it could take years. Not to mention such tenants leave the place filthy, dirty and demolished.
So now 17% of already misleading number of "unoccupied" apartments is 1/3rd? Considering most of those 17% "unoccupied" apartments are short-term rentals which are actually occupied by short-term tenants, and only fairly low number of apartments are actually unoccupied?
Introverts seekin to escape into france:  ''Yup I'm moving to Lozere.''
I wonder why the European countries keep investing their own people in external wars while they can't stand if it comes to their countries. They drowned many youth during War I & II.
too long
Australia, Russia, Iceland, and many other places have the same thing.
Witchcraft.
This is, frankly, exaggerated and irrelevant.  Travelling through rural France within the area you define, or rural France in the "populated" parts, you'd be unable to detect any difference at all.  Little villages and communes dotted about; agriculture, forests.  Vineyards, small towns, light industry.  Supermarkets, rural restaurants, garden centres, agricultural stores, builders merchants.  All over.
Is it 41 north 5 west
70% of western China is also empty, 90% of northern Canada is also empty, 99% of Alaska is empty, even in California, 50% of Northern and Eastern California is empty.  So is Australia which almost the whole nation is empty other than a few big coastal cities.  BTW, our brains can be considered as 90% empty since we don't utilize it most of the time.
India is 6 times bigger than france what dude..
If countries offered grants for houses, and had good internet access through ISPS, then I wouldn't mind living in the country side. I do work from home after all. I think that the WFH movement could reinvigorate the country-side, but it would need a large investment.
I'll tell you what it is, but you're not going to like it, and even less so, be inclined to agree with it.   What's true for France today is also true for Western Europe, as a whole.  They're contracepting and aborting themselves out of existence; race suicide.  This also holds true for European Russia and its southern and western neighbors, and especially, and to a large  extent, the United States.   In fifty years, only ten percent of the world population will be of European descent and those people will be mostly old.   Think of it!
Its not empty, it's beautiful and natural. The way the earth has always been until now- completely normal.
"WOW! People actually do be living in cities" had me rolling
Maybe controversial opinion here but France looks nothing like a Hexagon
Palestine is not a country, won’t be until the openly genocidal terrorists are labeled as such by people like you who use terms like “fighter” to avoid reality
Best thing ever. Lets hope it keeps on going.
Just one question: where is this State of Palestine? I am not aware of such a State existing now or ever having existed?!
But it's full of farms. To me Europe looks totally urbanized and full of farms without any trace of nature.
What idiot got the idea that that wedge is empty?  Have you been there?  Absolutely moronic assertion.
México siempre ha sido mayor(población y territorio) q Francia, solo q x tecnisismos europeos no se le consideraba un país.
A lot of that area is very mountainous. The Pyrenees and the Grand Massif
palestine is not a state
Lozère is the Wyoming of France
They should bring in more African males and Arab males to increase the birth rates.
Lesson: diagonals are not popular. It's bad Feng Shui
That diagonal is how all France (and the rest of the world) should be. We're dying of overpopulation.
I think Troyes and Auxerres, with the latters prodigious football team, might have an objection to this videos premise.
What a stupid thought!! Fortunately, every square feet is not occupied! We need to breathe!
People do be livin in cities. 😀
Any English people in here? Does anyone in England say '4 times less'?
looks like a wonderful idyllic place to live. Personally I could never live in a city like Paris must be a lot of noise, pollution etc. Growing up close to the artic you get allergies against people eventually
too much minutia disliked unsubbed and reported for wasting peoples time
"Nearly Identical in size to India"???....  India is the 7th largest country in the world with around 3mil km2......France is 49th with only about 500,000 km2.
So I am watching this video at 2:46 (and I like and have watched many of your other videos) when suddenly out of the blue, you make reference a non-existent independent nation state called Palestine?   In 2022, there is as yet no de facto nation state as Palestine that encompasses both the Gaza Strip (Egyptian territory) and the entirety of West Bank (Jordanian territory annexed in part by Israel) ???!!!!  As of July 2022 the West Bank of the Jordan River is not an independent de factor or de jure nation state but is in part annexed in part de facto as part of Israel or otherwise it is part of what are Israeli occupied territories administered in part by the Palestinian Authority.   You also show the outline of the Gaza Strip which is formally still part of Egypt and no longer occupied by Israel since 2006 but which shares no  government with the parts of the West Bank governed by the Palestinian Authority as Gaza is as of 2022 governed by HAMAS and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   Your flippant claim and statement about there being a de jure state called Palestine in your otherwise excellent video calls into question the accuracy of all of your assertions as you seem to be playing fast and loose with the facts and de facto political realities.  Too bad, because otherwise your videos tend to be very informative but I now have reason to doubt the accuracy of all of your videos which purport to be fact based.  I hate to be overly critical but that map of "Palestine" was just what we call here in the USA "hogwash" and it hurts your brand incredibly.  You might as well show me a map of Russia which includes all of Ukraine within the boundaries of the Russian Federation.   You may think that is how the map should be in a "perfect Russian World" , but it is not reflective of de facto political reality so why would you include a fake map in your video?
Your lack of hordes of coloreds and grifters in 1/3rd of your country disturbs me
Ok people, I get you wanna give examples of other territories like Canada or Brazil, but you gotta understand that this is in the middle of Europe, not in the frozen part of the world or where a gigantic jungle is.  . And yeah, Spain having the same problem would be interesting to watch their own reasons 🤔.
Madrid after seeing his Empty Diagonal  Madridistas : ........ Than who the hell live in the Capital ,Wanda and Santiago Bernebou  , Royal Palace ?  Demons ? Or Trees ?
Great video. I hope that home office and remote working will help to let us go back into these rural areas. I really think there is a chance here but governments need to force this issue.
Dead by shot or refugee?  Do the LGBTQP's hide over there or are they trying to turn the refugees of Muslim faith to their side and then they'll all be happy popping their pox?
Imagine thinking you know the why of the empty diagonal, when you don't even mention the Massif central nor the areas poisoned in the north east during WW1 where the trenches were, which are still unlivable today.
So uh... Maybe traditionalism and agrarianism weren't the worst? And perhaps there comes a point where urbanism, modernity, and humanism go a little overboard? Hmm...
Not gonna lie.... it should've been france.
They need to extend their metro
As always very Informative 👍🏼
It's not as empty as most people's heads
Male deaths don't really matter though.  Remember the old saying 10 men and 1 woman means in 9 months you have 1 baby while 10 woman and 1 man means in 9 months you have 10 babies.
This is true for every country
If someone can explain to me why a pentagon shaped country is nicknamed "l'hexagon" I will buy him/her a beer.
Lol seventh largest economy and eighth best funded military, hardly something to boast about. That's similar to a fat kid being proud of finishing seventh in an egg and spoon race.  It must really sting that renowned French arrogance to know they're verging on having the same pull internationally as Belgium. What an irrelevance France has become.  Lololol.
France: has about 1/3 of its land area as empty space Russia, Australia, Mongolia: Hold my beer
Looks like people are being fooled on all scales. Over population is laughable unless your talking about cities. Aliens are not real unless your talking about extra territory people. Ohh and you don't stay on a spinning ball floating in the sky
Again you've said Belarus as Bella-rus - it's pronounced Bel-a-ruse, unsubscribing, these ignorant pronunciations are just cringe worthy to hear. Great video but if you insist on using fantasy naming conventions, how do you expect to be taken seriously.
I bet there is 1 person there
Just because no one lives there doesn't mean that it's empty. What a stupid description.
If you wanna skip the wiki entry: youth don't wanna farm
In the 1960s, French singer Jean Ferrat sung of this trend of young people leaving the countryside in his famous and beautiful song La Montagne, describing the Ardeche region. I visited Ardeche as a boy and it's a lovely place to live but has little industry.
My Mum and Dad live in the dead zone, I've been there many times to visit them and wherever you go, it's just empty farmhouses and empty villages everywhere. And you're absolutely spot on...... youngsters leave these places as soon as they can to go and get a decent job and have some fun...
France GDP > than India but India doesn't sell weapons all over the world
More and more islam arabians and turks are invading those villages. French need to act before it is too late. Properties in there have lost value because of that.
I love countrys like Spain, norway whith low density, i hate big cityes, ou countrys like Bangladesh, Índia or even England were you almost never be Alone, thats the reason why England motorcycle riders go to wales, scotland or Spain.
Palestine isn't a state, never has been a state, and never will be a state. There is Israel, go ahead,  you can say ISRAEL. ya know, the homeland of the JEWS for the past 3800 years.
France nearly identical in size to India??? Really??? Do you even research these things? France is almost 544.000 km² while India is  over 3.287.000 km²
State of Palestine?
State of Palestine? What is that supposed to be? A fairy tale country or...?
Wow people actually do be living in cities
You should do one about over 60% of the US Pop living within 100 miles of the border!
And here i am moving to countryside from urban area...  There is no money to persuade me to live in city!
well, I'm a contrarian person and believe that as a species, we're pretty crazy, so I'm very happy living in rural areas - totally self sufficient with a lovely small sustainable local community of lovely people - folk in cities are about to find out how grim it is to be reliant on big corporations and governments for the basics that they need to survive - let alone the inevitable insecurity of being massive targets as World War 3 ramps up. Don't get me wrong - love going to the city for some full on cultural experience, but the excitement wanes pretty quickly and am always happy after a week or so to return to the peace and tranquility of the countryside.
China had a control through decades to avoid people from leaving rural areas, its quite interesting
אין מדינה כזאת פלשטינאים כי אין מדינה.
1:02 did you say "francestance"?
Okay I'm American so hang on hang on here, is it that uncommon in Europe to have large swathes of farmland? We have millions of square miles stretching multiple states that are like that.
Give it to me..i devloped these areas..
If "Demography is Destiny", than Russia's long term prospects are poor.
it's for the german tanks
"Wow, people actually do be living in cities." They do be now? You do be stupid sounding.
TLDW: it’s an agricultural area
A strange anomaly; isn’t an anomaly always strange?  It’s as silly as deja vous all over again
I love how the south of the diagonal turns when it comes to my city: TOULOUSE!!!
angers me how you say belarus
How the hell is France the same size as India? LOL
Very interesting facts. As Explained in the video france has its own story behind it. Apart from the facts outlined here I think most European countries are suffering from a similar demographic developtment. Spain was already mentioned but Italy and Germany are facing the same problems. Low brithrates are a logical consequence in our European Culture- Less agriculture- less production- less jobs. People move to bigger cities. Prices for rent in the cities go up even more. People have less space and work more to make a living-less space, less money & less time-birthrate goes down. That is the cultural difference between Asia, Africa, South America and Europe. Generally this phenomenon is an indicator for poverty or at least a bad development of a country. GErmany has similar problems in the north east. After the reunion the government could not bring enough jobs to the former socialistic part and there is still a poor infastrucuture. But as people leave the rural areas to have a better life in the cities a lot of people are forced to look for a place to live on the outskirts of the cities (especially families) and travelling every day 1 hour and more to work-less time-more environmetal damage-more costs for public transport etc. It is a vicious circle and a sad development. But on the other hand it could be that its also a blessing because where there are few people there are less problems. Maybe in the future it might be a place where people can live an enjoyable life when life in big cities becomes unbearable
The "Lozere"! 😅 for us, french, it s really THE desert. Personally, i like this place, its quite wild, and you ll meet only sheeps.
Sorry, but this video is not up to your normal standards. "Frances dominance in European affairs throughout the medieval, renaissance and early industrial periods"? This is too far off to count even as merely an oversimpification.
France is the 'separate country' the quebec terrorists want.
India is 6x the size of France
shhh, thats where they make the secret cheese
Cher ami, tu compares la densité de la population d'une ville française avec un pays occupé, volé et déchiqueté qui la palestine? Plus que 60% sont des réfugiés depuis 1948, 1967.. Are you serious??
Hmmm, sounds like a good place to be.
30 people per square km is actually quite fucking reasonable... what rest of France, UK or Germany have, not so much.
Interestingly enough, more & more people from the younger generations are fleeing the city (stress, burnout, over work etc etc) and seeking a better, more peaceful and sustainable life in the country side/diagonale you were talking about. I don't know what the numbers are but id be willing to bet slowly but surely more and more people are starting to live back in the country side of France...
Too unfriendly?
subject failed.  A whole video on the topic without even once mentioning massif central ...
Sorry I watched this….😴 surprised no mention of agriculture regarding the central plain 🤔🤔
Ñ
tldr; people live on the coast
Don't worry Europe, you're being replaced by invaders. Next is America😒
There is no state of Palastine. Even if you want to take a political stance and refrence the so called Palestinian territories, the numbera you showed are probably inaccurate. A better comparison would probably include the the city of Gaza, which is extremely densly populated.
Quite happy I stumbled across this channel. Excellent content :)
I'm french and was born and grew up in Toulouse, a big city  in the south. I moved  in one of these empty area ten years ago.  Best decision I've ever made.
0:25 did he say France is a Crepe power?
Now do Canada! 😆
There is no state named Palestine and never was. If the rest of your flick is also so inacurate, than it worth nothing.
Empty land in Madrid??????????????????????? 😕
wild cheers
BE LA RUS
This belt is also there because of preserved natural areas that span most of central France, where practically no one lives except for a few shepherds and rangers, and the fact that agricultural jobs nowadays are underpaid for the hard work they represent due to liberal economic practices, making the people flee such jobs. It would have been cool to not leave the social and ecological considerations out of your presentation, although it is pretty well explained from a demaographic and historical point of view.
palywood is not a real state. please send me links to the the history of this people. and if you refer to the GAZA strip we are taking a about a terror groups inside of ISRAEL. @RealLifeLore learn your facts next time.
Low population means low house prices,  thats why brits buy houses there!
I just came here to say your thumbnail is complete miseducation, and you should be ashamed
Hexagon is the bestagon
You guys are going to lose your minds when you hear about Canada Lool
England's population density is about 430 people per square kilometre. 56,000,000 people in 130,279 km2.
Dude. French is still the most populous contry in Europe, of all of the Countries that existed up until 1871 when Germany was united.  And no, I don't consider Russia to be European.
A lot of specialists in France are foreseeing that due to the overall decrease in petrol availability, this area won't stay void for long, simply because the huge cities model isn't sustainable without it, and no alternative energy source can replace it at scale. This is already currently known as the best place for young farmers to start alternative approaches.
0:00~9:17
Canada has alot more empty space then Fance
France is not nearly identical in size to India
in the same time, you have toulouse in this part, as one of the biggest city in France - and why 60 % and 40 % its because Marseille is the biggest port in France. That's why
We are from France..!
In Portugal the problem is MUCH worse. only about 10% of the whole population live in the interior areas. Out of 157 cities, about 100 are by the sea.
Due to all the moroccans, people left
Könntet ihr bitte deutsche Untertitel machen?
all the coutries in the world will have to reduce their population to preserve the biodiversity and climat and life
nearly identical in size to India? bullshit.  India 3.2 mln sq km France 0.5 mln sq km
The area looks like a woman’s foot...:-)
You can't look at this without asking who is behind it all.   One small group of chosen people.
Wow. France and Japan dramatically declined in comparative population
It's interesting. Their heaviest populations seem to be near boarders with corresponding heavy population on the other side. It's simular with Iran. It's interesting as these are both nations that controlled their own borders and formed naturally through history
Most countries have areas that are less densely populated than the rest. Like, for example,  the Great Plains states in the US. Who cares?
its the smell
Does not mean we have to swamp our nations with millions of 3rd worlders!
As I live in this empty diagonal, just next to the Lozère, I can confirm everything you said in your video.  I could add that most of the villages in this empty diagonal have problem of populaion disappearing little by little. In the smallest villages, there are only aged retired people, which means those villages will inevitably vanish in 20 years. Families never settle here because there's no employment at all, no public service, no shops, no church (the church basement exist in every village, but the Church have no means to pay a priest to be there all the time, and there's a spiritual crisis in the Church anyways).  All this creates empty lands with abandonned houses and villages, roads leading nowhere, and when the farmers leave too because they're paid barely 400 bucks a month while they can make 1300 bucks in the city, well, their fields become forests. I call this the "green desert" : the forests are expanding because nobody lives there anymore.  Another phenomenon is that the few moderate cities in this diagonal are literally absorbing all the departments rural population, creating urban hubs growing bigger and bigger by emptying everything else around. It's like creating population islands surrounded by nothing : the roads have many difficulties to absorb such fast population movements and inter-urban flows. This creates huge traffic jams in those rare cities where people arrive every day at an amazing rate. In the contrary, once you go outside those few ciies, the roads are empty and maintaing them costs too much money for villages having less and less population every year.  And as you noticed, there is no real solution to avoid this. Farmer's life is a nightmare of endless non-paid hours with zero holidays, a ton of loans to pay the machines needed, finding an employee is almost impossible. And while an homeless has 530€ to live every month paid by the region, as a farmer you're barely doing 400€. Globalization and huge companies in food industry or food supermarkets have plummeted prices for farms production.  When you visit France you can't know all this of course, but we're very far from being a paradise, even in the countryside ; and even if France is still a rather powerful country, is inhabitants are suffering many complex problems. Recently 130 emergencies services just closed completely because of impossibility to continue to work, which means if you're injured and go to he emergencies in an hospital, they will say you to go back home and call the emergencies ambulances who will carry you back to the emergencies if necessary. Such dramatic issues can be see in many state agencies unable to accomplish their mission anymore.
I like that, when continuing the diagonal into Spain, you took a good chunk of the Atlantic ocean into it. Because that's what I was always wondering: Why there aren't more people living and working some fifty kilometers off the northern cost of France. ;)
France surface area: 1 104 051 km2 / India suface area: 3 287 263 km2.  SO India is 3 times bigger than France.
Who cares ! 🙄
I quite enjoyed this until it turned into an ad.
1:10 - Wow, you cut the country in half along a carefully picked line, and instead of a 50:50 distribution you get 60:40. That's amazing! Unbelievable! I bet you can't draw a line across any other country and find that huge 10% deviation from 50%.   /le sigh
wtf is the state of palestine?
@02:25 non, there are 13 regions pas 18.
The real reason is the workers who were supposed to build houses here went on strike and never started to work again
You may have mentioned the lack of large rivers in this area and the mountains called Massif Central which is in center of this diagonale. Even if its the empty diagonale, its probably the longest and hardest journey to cross it.
Umm...has this dude ever seen a map of Canada?
The notion of empty is not the same in US and in Europe. In US you will found gigantic zone without human, just nature. It not exist in western Europe. Same in this zone, you will found villages all 5 kilometres and same little towns. But yes, it is true, infrastuctures, are really less concentrate into this zones call "emptyness diagonale" like density of population. By the way, if you want buy houses in this zones, they are very cheap. Some people buy easily ancient little villages (4 to 10 houses) lost into french countryside.
why is it empty ? mountains (Ardennes, Morvan, Massif Central, Pyrénées), mainly forests, with less fooding cultures
This is so completely dumb. That middle section of France is mountainous and remote. It is beautiful and peaceful and building a city or two there would be insane.  The North East is closer to the heart of Euro commerce and industry so naturally it is densely populated. People say the dumbest things on You Tube! Really! Colorado is not New York now, is it?
The so called west bank is not palestine. Gaza strip and PA is not palestine. palestine does not exist. This raises the question of how much one can really trust this video when the creator thinks there is a state called palestine something it is not.
:04 That's the danish flag, not the French flag 🙄  🇫🇷✔️ 🇩🇰 X
I don't see how going from a million agricultural workers to 400,000 is a sustainable trend.  What, will there be 0 farmers in France in 50 years?  I think a lot of these "empty" countrysides are going to become very desirable places to live, especially as food gets more expensive and as repressive government policies make urban life increasingly unpleasant.
That's sounds like absolute heaven to me, you can't go anywhere anymore without stampeding hoards of people. Where I live is we have amazing scenery but everyone wants a piece of it, cannot blame them tbf 🤣
nothin strange. people live near other countries for trade and economy. same thing is in usa,canada, britain....
Thank God Britain isn't as big as France. They'd only fill the extra space with freeloading immigrants.
The "State of Palestine" LOL 🤣
this video seems to assume that low population density is a bad thing. the world needs open space
France is not comparable in size to India at all......
Bad video, bad stats, bad channel
Say Belarus again.. I dare you
shh! don't tell the Africans!
Another reason you haven't mentioned is that we shoot down demographers, our favourite hobby over here.
American and Euro hipsters "lol haha lol the US flyover states are so boring and devoid of people, entertainment, culture and everything such boring loser states lol. Oh but will you look at the placid sanguine French countryside with its whale spas and windmills and farmers in quaint little houses with a cow in the front yard lol"
War(s) are evidence of mans supreme idiocy.
why do all places have to be full of buildings ?  empty   wilderness ?
How the hell was japan the 3rd largest country in the world? 😂 I never knew that
You can see it in their flag, it represents the empty white in the middle!
France is very nice.  I like it there.
*looks up "almost empty"* Oh, great, then my entire country is, let's see "almost empty"/2.
The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8).   Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18).  "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8
"In order to earn a living" that's why people move to the cities , but this is because we're forced by terrorists calling themselves bankers and governments to live in their fraudulent monetary system of blackmail and extortion , it also protects those who prove they are good little slaves to their system by paying back 95% of their earnings to the terrorists organization .
Um the French alps?  To steep and inhospitable for suburban development.
Apart 2 or 3 french people I can notice that most of comments come from abroad people and I'm french lol
I'm french and I even didn't notice that lol
The real reason is part of a secret peace treaty saying they wont build a castle on a mountain that would be impossible to raid without massive or even collosal collateral damage.
yeah wo..... not, have you heard of Australia? lit 3/4 of the country is a dead zone
I thought they were gonna say the area is haunted or something.
Oh. So this is just an ad for a learning platform then.
This anomaly is found around most of the country's today. However there is a narrative that the planet is over populated.
I’m staying in Bergerac in the south of the diagonal area, and I wouldn’t call it an issue at all. There are thriving markets, wonderful buildings, fast internet, friendly people, and importantly nature hasn’t been concreted over to no end. It’s a beautiful area of the world that is special and protected, why turn it into another monotonous human city made of grey concrete and metal.
well, I wont bopther looking for the altitude in the center of France, but in my general knowledge populations inhabit preferably near body waters, has there is ocean on either side the center would have a bit of a 'void' isn't that simple? am I incorrect???
France is NOT "nearly identical" in size to India.  India is OVER 5 TIMES the area of France, at about 3,287,263 km2 vs. France's 643,801 km2.  Are you even researching information for your videos, or just making things up for clicks?👎
Sinnlose Statistik. In den USA ist die Verteilung viel krasser. Meaningless statistics. In the USA, the distribution is much more blatant
Population loss because of war, potential fathers, demographic problems, low population density areas. He's talking France, I hear Russia. And it makes me sad.
The most romanticised thieves in the history on mankind: frenchkiss, french fries, french toasts, language of love bla bla bla they can never do wrong. I say, when are they ever going to pay Africa back(reparations) for all the havoc they've wrecked on that continent & still continue to do?
France is finish.
Oh nobody want to live in the middle of a desert, how strange .......  Human intelligence reduced to numbers = Futur of the world reduced to zero.
A corridor for invading forces to feel at home 😁
i live in this zone!! don't  urbanize it! we love our rural areas!!
You said France military and great on the same breath…I almost spit out my coffee
For those of us who are American, it is difficult to comprehend how devastating World War I was to France, and Europe in general. In the US, WWI is not thought of much, because we only participated at the end, and lost comparatively few soldiers. WWII is a much bigger focus in US History. But WWI was a catastrophe for Europe on a scale without parallel in any American war. By comparison, the Battle of Verdun alone had more casualties than all American casualties in World War II.
Long video and many observations. But the conclusion is?
Its empty due to Louie14's Edict_of_Nantes **revocation** & enforcing the CodeNoir. Dumping its original inhabitance on what we call Haiti & the Caribbean. A major landgrab only possible through expulsion, exile. Many eradication's like these are blotted from indoctrine & nothing like todays "gentrification".
Large country, large military, and what war did they have a significant contribution to winning?
owned by rich people. why the fuck do you think they want the 95% dead.
There is no state of Palestine on the map. Its called Israel. Stop being nazi.
Yes, Mother Earth is so overpopulated..
People always live closest to water. Ports, more business, more jobs, bigger cities. I don’t see the big deal about country living. You have space. It’s cheaper, quiet, low crime, natural living.
Correct me if I'm wrong but this isn't rare. I mean the US, Canada, China, to name a few have large uninhabited areas with almost nobody. So what gives ?
W...hat k...ind of pronounciation is this?
Sooo that's Frances version of "fly over states"? Know where to visit if I can ever get back to the EU. Neat video
People live near the coast, the video.
Because the perinies have the high ground.
Is it because of the alps?
There is actually twice as many French but most are in hiding.
excuse me, but France and India almost the same size? I highly doubt it and Wikipedia also
No. To be part of la Diagonale, its southern border had to bulge outwards significantly to include Lozere. Why spoil a good article with such ridiculous, unnecessary and easily disproved hyperbole?
France is not a great global power, they're a second tier power the only first tier global powers are the US and China
What ? They know something about Belarus ?
As a Dutch person, I'm very happy that France is reserving a large area of land for when our country sinks below the sea in the near future. Merci beaucoup!
I live in West By God Virginia and if my experience here translates at all then I'm sure that 1/3 of the country that's less populated is the best part of the country. Saturation of people is highly overrated! I prefer peace and beauty in the mountains any day.
There is no State of Palestine.
French history...the majority of peopkexstill love in what would have been considered belonging to the monarchy while the other regions you first entiibwere those tgat opposed or rebelled or worked with the English.  So the French unwittingly live in what would be considered true France.
ok this is a waste of time.
Viva la France. My mother's people were from the Dodar region. Came to the city of New Orleans in1730, Marc Dodar delabusharlie.
and here we have the netherlands with over 500 per km2.
Tldr; It's FARMS And modern big scale FARMS need less people.
There is no state of Palestine.
This is what we’re doing to Ukraine by encouraging them to Jin in proxy war with Russia
Not enough froggs in that empty zone. So far for overpoputation propagandists.
Not an issue at all, the average population density in Europe is much to high. These small areas with normal population density are areas of relief for the environment
No no . States have different laws & rules between them . Even the speed limit is different on the roads in different states .
These underpopulated areas sound like good places to move to.
Because they keep sending their asylum seekers here to the UK which is full, our population of 67 million is 2 million more than France and our landmass is nearly half that of France
I can’t wait to revisit after Covid, France is such a gorgeous country and so spacious and beautiful scenery and stunning food.  It’s so noticeable when you travel from crowded England across La Manche to Caen and then run south on those wonderful open roads. Why would I ever go north in England when it leads to Manchester and Liverpool (it’s grim oop north) when I can hop on a ferry and be in La Rochelle by mid afternoon 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Palestine ????? Why not name another mythical land Atlantis ?
Nothing like China’s abandoned cities
Don't think of France as 1/3 empty, Think of it as 2/3 full.
I don't plan to watch the video because we are already studying it at school, so I don't know if it was said in the video but we call it "The Diagonal of the Void"
Reason why people move to the city where by Gods commandments are NOT the place to LIVE but to spread all over is SIN! Ppl love their sins!

There are vast areas of the central and western USA where its sparsely populated (farmland, mountains, and deserts). Why this would be surprising or interesting to anyone is very strange to me. I think only city dwellers can't comprehend this perhaps...
If you all like "Paris" so much maybe learn to pronounce it correctly. The S is Silent at the end of any French word, aside exceptions.
Fiery Fellow Fiercely Favors Fs
Not even close to the size of India
Being from Lozère myself , it makes me laugh seeing this video knowing that even a lot of french people don't know about Lozère either 😂😂
The "state" of Palestine.   Palestine has never, ever been a state. Maybe if it didn't hate Jews so much, that wouldn't be the case.
This is silly
good ,they need green space
I feel like this video is pointing out something incredibly insignificant
This guy pronounces names very badly.
And centralism ? Doesn't help to fix it!
how is this a 10 minute video it's like 2 minutes of content
How are you stating that France and India are "nearly identical in size." 0:10 According to the Internet, France has 210K sq miles while India has 1.27 Million, making India roughly 6x as big as France.
I'm guessing its due to topography mountains?
Only 30 persons per square kilometre? That's still ~twice Finland's pop density. :D (I think we're up to 17 or 18 by now.)
Depopulation.
Greeting to the land of the free and equality France 🇫🇷 from the land of civilization Egypt 🇪🇬 🫶🏼
It is simply because there are not enough inflatable boats for the other Two thirds to cross the channel.
Still too many French ppl out there tbh
In the US, if you drive up the Great Plains from Texas to Canada, it’s pretty darn empty. Thousands of square miles of open space.
Everything north of hugging the border
Lol check out empty Canada 🇨🇦
I'd be curious to see how WW1 trench lines line up with this vacant area. If warfare relocated people to urban centers where they began to work and make a life why would they go back? Added to this unexploded ordinance from WW1 Nad WW2 are still a big issue in the French countryside.
One thing I think you are missing is the cost of labour, and the season impact.  Rural areas are traditionally farmland as you identified.  Farming modernization has led to a more independence on better farm equipment and less man power.  Consider the same regions here in Canada, the population jumps during harvest season, but not something you would see in the stats.  Most harvesters are foreigners that are brought in for a few months and are then sent home at the end of the harvest.
France great power?  They haven't been a great power for nearly a century.  Not competitive, just historically accurate
People from losère are the funniest, know that from experience
About 90% of the world's population lives above the equator.
That's where they store the smelly cheese.
There is no Palstine. Its a lie, these lands called Judea and Samaria and are parts of Israel
Any respect for this destroyed by the narrator (early in conclusion - 9.15 ) says "...people actually do be living in cities......". What a monstrous phrase!
Before making such a simplistic claim, you should check the population densities of all of the regions of France. It is normal for people to be concentrated in the more level areas of any country so what is the big deal ? No doubt you are aware of the massif central and I am surprised that you have not included much of the mountainous area just west of Italy. In any case, to say that your "diagonal" is "almost empty" is not true. Most countries have areas that are more populated and less populated, so what is the big deal ? Which country are you going to do next? Perhaps Egypt ? As a geography teacher, I must say that these videos have very misleading titles.
Being overpopulated is not a good thing for the people who live in these countries.
It's not.
2:45 Palestine is a Country!
It's dangerous in Europe, Americans are being warned to never vacation in these places, France, Germany,  Spain,  England  just to name a few
Interesting video until it turned into an advertisement.
France: We have died a lot at WW1 Russia: We have a lot died at WW1, WW2, Afganistan and And men usually only live to 55-65. Because life not matter, only desspair
France: We have died a lot at WW1 Russia: We have a lot died at WW1, WW2, Afganistan and And men usually only live to 55-65. Becaus life not matter
You're talking a lot but you're not saying anything, when I have nothing to say my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again?
im dyslexic when you overcrowd a socity ,it affects  it in a very bad way ,and thats why they do it ,to destroy socity ,in the 70s they were exspermenting on monkeys social life,and studying the behaver of rats ,and we have more incommon, with rats than monkeys in a socity setting,as monkeys work and feed and live in a group ,were we are independent ,like the rat we work alone keep to are selves ,and follow the same metods and process ,we follow the same path every day ,we have a set plan ,i saw the doc about yrs ago ,it will be on youtube ,im not going to say  what they claim over crowding does ,as its not some think i want to say,search it study of rats in a socity over crowded
Because it is over populated…
They are called Natural parcs....protected areas.  PS.: It's not the english channel...it's called La Manche
1:00 it's a foot
This vid was pointless
Because it's so big ?
There are also the MEDICAL DESERTS.   I work in France and I can tell you the state imposed rules that do not allow doctors/nurses/physio etc to continue to install in attractive areas so they have no choice to work in the diagonal.   They can go to an hospital but not to open theirs own "cabinet".
Too much filler, couldn't watch.
Here is the perfect solution to house all the immigrants flooding across into Europe then surely.  It would solve over populated places like the UK and help re balancing the population within France. I wonder why President Macron hasn`t thought of that ?
France is “nearly identical in size to India”? How? India is more than 6 times larger than France by area and 20 times more populous. (Yes the populous part you got right)
Spain has the identical issue, just much worse...
Sorry, this is nowhere near accurate.
thurrrriving
I have always wondered why the British have rotten yellow teeth, in addition they often have bad breath...we will continue to send you migrants, hoping that there are dentists among them.
The reason it's empty there is simple: All the people who live in cities need their bread, fruit, vegetables, eggs, you name it. They need to eat. I'm not French, but I've worked in the low dense area at a Dutch camping for Dutch families with children who ave multiple disabilities. We brought all those children together between meals and with one-on-one or one-on-a few guidance (depending on their disabilities) we made sure they had a blast of a holiday, all in their own language. The parents could come along, or just rest for once -  because those children were a lot of hands full 24/7. I contemplated on moving out there for a while. Because it was peaceful there, but it had all the modern necessities.  And perhaps needless to add, it was the most wholesome job I've ever had. The parents (heros in my eyes) were so happy to have an opportunity to get out of their very demanding daily routines.
Nearly identical in size to India? India is about 4 times bigger
You lost me with "Home to 68 billion people" - Joke !
The commentary to this video is not listenable! It is editing-out breath pauses, which never happens in normal verbal interactions. It is both unnatural and annoying. What need is there for such editing?
Please learn to pronounce Belarus
Please can anybody share unique family friendly open minded cultural welcoming holiday destination in France. Beach and mountainous destinations please?
There are big sections of California where you can perch on a small mountain and only see distant signs of humanity on the far horizon, if at all.  You could dump entire European countries in just this state and not find them for years if you traveled by foot or horse.  This a partly a matter of perspective.  Am I the only one here noticing that Europe's demographic crisis starts with the abandonment of the Catholic Church and the gradual adoption of socialism in its various forms?  As has been pointed out by those wiser than me:  Socialism=Death.
People can continue to flow to the cities, I'll keep my out in the boondocks living, thank you very much. I love country living, and my neighbors are nice and friendly people.
Hum hum
I live in that area. We have fibre optic internet to almost every village in my départment (32, Gers). Organic farmers and smallholders have gone up from 1150 to over 1800 in the last 5 years, making ours the French départment with the highest number. A ‘new’ way of living locally and environmentally responsibly (not that new really…) is attracting people from all over Europe. I guess what you conclude depends on your metrics. And what is happening in that band of supposedly no-man’s-land may be more significant than we think…
interesting but the stupid "music" is very annoying
I think we must use this space to make some great things.
You should do one on why 3/4 of the U.S. is almost empty.
So what?
what are the name of some more affordable university towns in this lower-density region of France?
It's almost like our degenerate modern western culture is so antinatalist that it's actually suicidal.
Empty is the mind that believes there is ‘emptiness’ anywhere in existence..  spaceandmotion
Let the stateless people (like Rohingya, Kurd, and others from other conflict zones) be settled there!
Great place for illegal immigrants who keep coming to the full UK?
Does he actually explain why is it empty in the video? Constant repetition of the same point sent me to the sleep
real reason is because france is ontop of a magic ley line that spawns rats.
This is the most inane geographical or demographical topic I have ever stumbled on.  If most other countries populated equally across their respective areas, and with unchanging reproduction rates, this vid _might_ have a scrap of significant content.   They don't.  It doesn't.   The changes in the population and urbanisation in France, are no more unusual than those in any other nation.  😑
I accept your description of French demographics .... so why have 29,000+ illegal immigrants arrived in England from underpopulated France across the Channel ...??
C'est du gros portnawak.
Just listen to the way people speak in Auxerre, and you can see why no one wants to live there! ;-)
2:45 "The state of Palestine." There is no state of Palestine. This video is propaganda.
It’s not empty if grape vines live there.
Interesting subject, but repetitive and LONG.
England seems to have the reverse problem.  Lockdowns caused people to flee cities.  Countryside areas saw their population grow by anything up to 30%.  Across the country many mass development programmes are occurring on the outskirts of towns in areas known as "green belt" (the green countryside that surrounds a town that is  normally forbidden to be built upon).  Thousands of homes are being added to small rural towns.
It's cool that the diagnal is shaped like a woman's bare foot.
FYI - there is no "State of Palestine". WTF is your problem?
This video is so useless, the diagonal is meaningless, you just randomly draw lines while trying to avoid the big cities, Marseilles and coast, Paris and Lille, the Lyon up to Strasbourg and the industrial area. If u avoid this ofc you're left with a bunch of farmland. even this area has big cities Toulouse, Dijon, Reims...
its not hard to teach french army to raise white flags for their leaders..
The majority of most nation population is around the coasts.  You could say much the same about the center of the US.
Well, I've never heard France being referred to as L'hexagon and as far as the "empty" part goes, you can say that about pretty much any country, including the USA, which is essentially "empty" right through the middle. So basically, this is a non-issue.
People like to live in maybe irrational ways: we'r not the type to evenly space out.. we like to congregate. We also like empty space: many people in one place, not many people in other places, and lots of folks who like live in one but visit the other.
Palestine is not a state. don't confuse israel's teritory controled by insurgents with a state.
Interesting. Australia has sheep and cattle stations the size of this empty diagonal, with maybe 20 to 100 people max living in that area, just to give a difference in perspective to population density. 🤔
"Four times less", makes no sense. Do you mean 1/4 as much?
It is a fallacy that Men being gone to war keep Women from getting pregnant...They just settle for whatever is left and the birth rate carries on.
cos they are all being sent to the UK  :P
its because they eat frog legs and run away when the shit hits the fan.fuck me they should be happy they have the brits next to um
I HEARD IT WUZ HAUNTED...
Nobody wants to be a farmer anymore, Paris's arrogance towards these regions, the lack of very basic lifenessecities, the worrying rise of extremeright, chosen mayors what leafs to a lot of local corruption, the excessive pensions for nearly everybody but farmers: do the math.
it is shaped like a french woman's foot.
11 minutes of statistics, mostly meaningless and repetitious, ending with a very obvious conclusion.  The same video would be used for many countries in the world. More people live near the coast and major waterways leading to the coast, less people live in mountainous areas where transportation is difficult therefore more expensive.
India is 6 times as big? how can it be nearly identical?
Just say you hate Jews.
And to be fair, a majority of this area is either covered by mountains, or far from interconnections (major rivers, coasts, exchange routes). It explains a lot.
Correction. England's population density is actually around 435 per square km and not 270.
Globalism and control of the masses
It mirrors the empty void inside Macron's head
Probably nice living in that region
mINUS FOR SILLY MUSIC
Out of all the countries roughly that size, why tf would you pick Palestine? Could not have picked ANY less controversial “country”??
It would be stranger if the population density was consistent across France or any country.  You've got areas of mountains, no lakes, no port cities, no farming, other areas of rivers, good land, natural boundaries for defense.  The map at 1:25 shows nothing unusual.
France is essentially Lost to a corrupt authoritarian that has allowed africans to replace the demographics of his country.
I think France losing world war 1 and world war 2 is mainly due to having a region named "Loser".     No Wonder they wave the whiteflag at first Contact with enemys 😂😂
I thank you for calling Palestine a state you're one of the good ones 🥹🥹🥹
How many decades until France is renamed New Africa?
There is no state of Palestine.
Interesting how this video perpetuates antisemitism by ignoring the national state of Israel by calling it by its old Roman pagan territorial name: Palestine.
For the snail farms.
It’s not Palestine. It’s Israel!
if there isn't I would love to watch the same kind of video ob Italy.
I live in this empty diagonal...and trust me, it may be poor, but it worth widly well than Paris or Marseille which are nowadays really dangerous and having more money will not give you a more comfortable and secure life than here.
Varg lives there
"France... nearly identical in size to India" (0:16) - ??!!  India is 5 (FIVE) times LARGE.
France would be such a lovely country if it wasn't for the French.
That’s where they store the wine and the cheese and the croissants and the quasi-secret affairs …
Lost of data aspects put in some fudged relations here, assumeing facts i would consider as rather extremized, having found an information chunk to nibble on, or what? Have you communicated with anybody closely related to France? Or dou you prefer reading statistics put into maps? Did you explain the gathered facts here? The so-called "EU" (european union) cripples farmers and handycrafters on the continent, the people from outside must think its all EU-idiocy (t)here.  Why couldnt the other regions on the other hand be classified as overpopulated? But you collected some mindable data though. Whilst repeating the same of scarcely populated regions in other countries. Why should there be humans everywhere? To me, youre complaining about weak regions were there arent any.  Je vois pouquoi ce video n'est pas met dans l'internet par une personne française, n'est-ce pas? C'est votre avis personelle implementé ici.
Prolly cuz they didn't build anything there
looks like a chocolate bunny to me.
The whole of Scotland is under populated as a result of rich and absent landlords (many of them English or at least not regularly resident in Scotland) the over-recruitment of Scots in the British Military over the past two centuries (a deliberate policy) and the effect of the Highland and Lowland clearances.  Also the artificial maintenance of 'grouse moor' for the pastimes of the idle rich since the 1800s.  The Scottish Government is trying to change this, but it's hard under both Capitalism and Westminster rule.  One thing which distinguishes Scottish attitude from our English counterparts is a greater enthusiasm for immigration and the development of 'civic nationalism' by which all people who wish to come and live and work in Scotland and make it a better place are considered welcome.  Sadly, without any control of immigration policy, we are still subjected to the UK government's racist and xenophobic ideas on immigration and asylum.
Why dont they put the Dinghy men there
So if you draw lines that exclude all the major populated areas of France you get an area that is slightly less populated? Amazing.
Demography and the population  doesn't explain the posterity  of a country. Just as this video is talking to point out and do a comparison  for only one thing in goal.. Consumerism.  The religions and it's goal to tie the humanity to  Consumer life is always there to tie us to make the religious run regime  rich. But It is peaceful to live in such free spaces than living in concert box lives which is called urban  life.
You didn't even mention the Massif Central!
Im from exactly in this diagonal (at the east from Paris) and this is France's i love ! Thousand and thousand of small towns, more cows than human population, massive areas covered by fields and forest. Even cities aren't overcrowded and noisy as hell.
Total fake click bait
so you recognize Palestine as a State?
france a great power hahahahah
You can do this for almost every other country, but it's in line with your other videos: making a big fuss about nothing
Why do you call Judea and Samaria, palestine?  Those lands are part of Israel, not the property that was stolen and occupied by the Ottoman Turks.
2:22 correction: England has a population density about 430 per square kilometre. The number given, 270, is the population density of the United Kingdom, which obviously includes less densely populated regions like Scotland.
Where is Palestine ?
mountains..
Err, there are mountains in that region. Just watch Le Tour de France cycle race through it.
Because it's not Belgium.
Movement to urban centres. Distance to the coast. Less economic activity.
bro that ain’t France that the goofy ahh grand line
Ain’t nothing is called Palestine just a lie  Spread truth not lies
My guy is obssesed by my country
did you just say there live 68 BILLION??? it's million my friend 😂
At 2:44 you're wrong the State of Palestine's surface is approx. 28000km², 6 times the surface of Lozère.
Less people live in the country…….brilliant, I never knew that.
Glorious idiot is comparing a country that was looted for 150 years by the British rascals to a country that is still looting Africa. Don't compare India with any other European country. India is a continent and no European leader has the political maturity to govern such a huge country with such diverse people
You're seeing a reverse trend, immigrants flock to the cities. And people flee to the countryside because of crime. All it takes for shit to really hit the fan would be a complete economic crash, something people on the countryside will be more equipped to deal with.
The less people, the better.
what is palestine?
Waarom doen ze daar de vluchtelingen niet heen of naar Spanje
So these Europeans countries actually have plenty space for the refugees?
More or less it seemed to go well, although a bit forced, given that it put a rounded shape to leave out large cities like Toulouse.... But suddenly he says that "if we forget international borders and we see that the diagonal continues in Spain and even widens"... and he puts Madrid inside, which is 7 million people and a sixth of the population of Spain. .. Go disaster!. At least he could have turned south around Madrid to go to the Almería area, to hide a bit.
France being the most populated country in Europe while Spain got 0 population increase in the XIX century.
But this is true for a lot of the world, what is the major consequence of this empty diagonal, and why should something be done about it?
to me an area that has 76,000 is a good to mid sized town!!  I've lived in towns were there are less than 30,000 people , or very small towns with 10,000 or less and its bound to happen you know somebody who knows somebody who knows you - and your business and past drama .. 😑🙄
I'd much rather live in the country than a big city.
LOL do Australia
“This area is the size of that area.” There. Now you don’t have to watch this 11 minute video
THEY KILLED US WHITES OFF. THE NEPHLIUM GIANTS OFFSPRING
THE AFRICANS MEXICANS INDIANS REFUGEES.
60 40 percent isn't thar big a difference
your lines dont really match the maps...
France is not a major power anymore it's only relevant because they suck the blood of the poor Africans and other enslaved ppl they can't let go of. I hope one day they actually stop but probably they will be super poor without the resources of the colonies they still abuse.
As a french the diagonale du vide slashes back to the nord pas de calais then back to normandy pretty much circling paris outer zone
I surrender! 8th best funded army, are you kidding?
That's the best place to live .  Few to No fuckking neighbors to fuck with ya.
I just scrolled through it on Google maps... Didn't seem very empty to me lol
Palestine is most definitely not a state, it’s a terrorist enclave
All that empty space in Russia allowed it to crush Napoleon and the 3rd Reich.
booooring
I think france has some beautiful countryside and the great wildlife.i have seen some docu.just showing the wonderful landscapes.
No one likes the French.
Sounds a little similar to central U.S. There called the fly over states.
In France, we call this  "La diagonale du vide", which can be translated by "diagonal of the void". The reason we got used to give is that this region was once very industrialised, especially the northern part with coal mines and Mettalurgy industries who mostly got stopped due to the transition to Nuclear energy for coal, and the lower cost of production in China for mettalurgy.
There is no Palestine.  It is the country of Israel.  Also many countries have more population in coastal and urban areas.  I prefer the less populated areas, but to each his/her own.
Is this possibly the least pointless video ever?  Agricultural areas have lower populations, maybe you should get a nobel prize for establishing less people live in rural areas than in cities
After living in overcrowded London for fifty years it been bliss to never be sitting in traffic jams , driving is now a pleasure in SW France ,
click bait vid. Every country will have something like this or the other. Not undermining France...Infact, it is good that there is a quiet place, untouched and green.
Its almost like UN Agenda 2021 and UN Agenda 2030, to move populations to urban centers, is working?  Its a joke to say they are trying to reverse this trajectory. They are forcing everyone to be reliant on governments so they can begin the depopulation of the globe by 2100.
My first thought, after not finishing the video, is that this region  of France may be primarily agricultural, which would make sense.
its not empty. the rothschilds own it. remember folks, France is harboring the worst human being on the planet. the kind of human being that owns people like Soro's, and rich enough to fund whole governments
The central-eastern part of Spain is called "south lapland" because there are less people living there than in lapland itself.  Some countries of Europe are slowly dying, and its gonna be a huge problem in the uncoming future.
Why this area is almost empty? Just because there is just nothing to do there :D
0:22 and has more white flags than any other nation
Because, who want's to live in France? It's full of French people.
Isn't that a positive?
why am i watching this? 😂
Maybe it's because the French are reputed to make love with their face rather than their sausage :-)
In video ad is an automatic thumbs down 👎
Because its boring there.
Well its actually nice that the population density is low. At least we can take care of nature and wildlife that is almost extinct in Europe. And England and Germany are worst in that. House next to house.
While France’s population was the largest in Europe during most of the 18th century, I think Russia’s population had passed France’s by 1800.  Estimates for year 1800 are 29 million for France and 35 million for Russia.  Russia’s population then expanded rapidly in the 19th century.
The US has a similar issue.  Huge populations on the east and west coasts, and much lower population density in the central areas, sometimes called “flyover country”.
That's wrong. I know for a goddamn fact that the Kalos pokemon league is there.
Perhaps the populace were afraid and ran away?
I live in the south of the “massif central” about an hour from the Med. It’s very hilly and mountainous, great for hiking , biking etc. There are many small communes and villages and loads of emptiness inbetween, it’s great.  You can walk for hours and not see a soul, summers are really hot, high 30’s, the winds howl of the Med and Atlantic.  Great place to live, i’m English and i love it here!
I really have to roll my eyes when I see so many people idolising these remote areas. Yes, they may be pristine, quiet and healthy, but only if you are rich and choose to live there. If you are an average person, the fact that these areas don’t have access to simple infrastructure, schools, hospitals, supermarkets, jobs, etc. would be anything else than relaxing, but a severe issue. Calculating with 2+ hours a day because you always have to drive hundreds of kilometres to do the simplest things, get to your job or meet friends is an ultra stress factor.
French demography is one of the main reasons the US doesn't speak French. France was always one century ahead of others European countries in demography. So when English, Irish, Germans, Dutch fled the famine to the US, due to its low birth rate, France withstood the famine far better and fewer French migrated to the New World.
running out of ideas are we?
I live in town in Canada that has a population of 41 000 people and there are definitely smaller towns. We are only 1 hour away from Toronto, which is the largest city in the country. France has a population of 67 million people whilst Canada has one of 38. I’m sure we all know how much bigger Canada is. It’s interesting to see how empty some of these big places truly are. I’ve been to Wembley stadium with about 70 000 people attending. It’s crazy to think that my entire town couldn’t even fill up half the stadium despite having 274 square km.
What software did you use to create the ortho rotating map?? I use microstation and auto cad C3D. This mapping you’ve done makes visualization so easy!
So Madrid is in the empty diagonal?
why? bla-bla-bla -- 10 minutes later --  bla-bla-bla. that's why. dislike for my wasted time
Weird to compare the density of France with the density of only a part of the UK.
Because of French mountains Alps...
Vidéo informative, mais je pense que certains pourcentages sont erronés. Je vis dans la bande diagonale du sud-ouest et la densité de population est d'environ 1 personne par 17 kilomètres carrés, à moins que vous ne parliez de toute la bande et que vous en fassiez la moyenne.
When I imagine what a cancer would look like on the face of the earth, i think of a city. Too many people. Too much crime. Too much dependence on someone else. Too much in general. Excess anything is bad.
Anderson Coopers Bung is never empty
7:49 Not trying to be rude but that diagonal in Spain it's very very wrong. Even if you include Madrid because is the capital and might be an exception you included Basque Country that is one of the most populated regions. You are including the most populated province after Madrid and Barcelona when you didn't have to because you could do the line without doing that strange circle.
ive never heard anyone refer to france as l'hexagon or the hexagon lol
1) stop making these videos, for the sake of the country you make these videos. France isn't empty, it's overfill with literal shit  2) Lotta jews in these comments mad about Palestine, go kvetch somewhere else
I wound like to move to those uninhabited places in France and Spain.  Can’t catch covid or be harassed by the government when you live in a forest.
and that's the best part to live in...  just like how city ppl make fun of the countryside, as soon as they get wealth they try to live somewhere that looks like it......  stay in your rabbit pens we don't want you!
That's usually the thing with Europe. Many places, too few people to populate.
That void looks like a women’s left foot
People can't earn a living farming. Like everything else, huge conglomerates control agriculture the same way they control every aspect of life. So no locally owned grocery stores, pharmacies, garages, clothing stores, etc. A small  business or family farm can't compete. I'm sure this is the case in France as it is here in the US.
India is more than six times the size of France, so calling their area "nearly identical" is inaccurate.
I switched off before the ACTUAL question was answered. Too much waffle.
So what do you want to do? Fill it with the GOAT PEOPLE?
I comment before I watch the video but I've been working on a little projet..... And it's cover exactly the part..... The fact we don't use enough of our land.....
Hmm.. weird, Netherlanders are biche bluehelms
I would love to live in a less densely populated area. Where I live in the country side, industries and urban-minded people are quickly encroaching. (By urban-minded I mean, who use a lot of pesticides, destroy the native flora to plant fashionable trees, put on very bright leds that mess with nocturnal birds, etc).
Just wondering - what would happen if that rate had plummeted up?
Sounds like that's the place to be. Dense population can't be healthy.
France is not as significant country. It's lost every war it's ever fought just about
There’s no one there cos all the immigrants are in the uk
It's not empty,- it's nature.
These countries know they need to be strong.  They know the US is weak and is probably not able to help them out nowadays. Weak government aids in their weakness!
That's what makes it the best place in France to visit.   Seriously, if you're going to Europe, go to Czechia, Netherlands or Poland instead.
Population drops, that's what world leaders now again want.
I do think it can be a good thing in general if population concentrate in fewer centres and the rest is left for agriculture or wild nature. Of course such trend must be to a good extent controlled and planned, otherwise we'd have favelas and lacking water/school/health etc. services if not colera outburst in the overpopulated places...
You should check 19th century density maps before jumping into wrong conclusions
The anomaly is gigantic cities, not the « empty » areas
2:50: Palestine is not a state.  Bad video.  You fail, try again.
And why is this an issue?
Cos it's a shite hole
France has been though many border based wars. France people like to live near boarders and by beaches. Both of these and other things often unique to France added together make this this not exactly shocking.
French economy entirely propped up by payments from African countries.
I feel like this video is missing a mention of the Massif Central, which is the bit in the middle of the diagonal where it balloons in the direction of the Mediterranean. It's a huge highland region which had relatively little transport infrastructure up to the 20th century due to its geography.
They only have that many military bases so that they have more places to hide if it all kicks off!
you smoke guy... This area isn't empty...
Can you make a video "Why XX percent of Germany is almost empty"? I wanna know where it is to go there.
I don't understand why young starving artists don't move to these cheap, beautiful towns and repurpose them. You can buy an old historic house for SO cheap (although it would need renovations) in a small village that has long-forgotten castles and rivers and spend your days painting the countryside or writing or whatever. Get all your other artist friends to move in too and revitalize the place.   I spent some time in this area and the only people who see its worth enough to move there is British immigrants. Why don't the French see it?
It's hardly empty.
"while the french military is still srugling to shed the reputation of being a joke" here , i fixed that line for you :D
Without stealing from French colonialism France is nothing. Very arrogant and repressive leadership.
How else would you maintain an unofficial DMZ between traditional France to the northwest and African-immigrant France to the southeast? While the north riots over plummeting milk prices or soaring milk prices, etc. (ensuring that they always have an excuse to riot), the south is the new stage for African and Middle Eastern imams still trying to avenge Charles Martel defeating them at the Battle of Tours, naturally called "The Battle of the Highway of the Martyrs" in their accounting.
began not begin
Solution is better transport - live in the country and work in the city... big cities are insanely crowded and bery unhealthy to inhabit
Some of your comparisons are off
Because that's where all the cows live. Look it up.
“The State of Palestine”? Last I checked that doesn’t currently exist.
BORING
This is the case everywhere... I lived in Toulouse which is in your "empty" spot... It's far from empty, you should check, lively, exciting city, one of the biggest in France... Sure the surroundings are quiet but still... I find it funny how some say here Paris emerges out of nowhere when you come from the east... Some are really not paying attention to their surroundings in they believe that. Sure there are many rural areas before like the Champagne (we do need vineyards for that) and even the Seine-et-Marne is not as inhabited as the rest of the Région Parisienne, but it's far from empty... There's a lot more emptiness in many states in the US between both coasts.
The upside about this is that these regions are generally Gorgeous (especially the Southern part) and it's not crowded with tourists in the summer
India is 5 times bigger than france
The video itself is nice, but "State of Palestine"? Try comparing sth next time to Narnia!
In fact, the biggest centers in France are Lyon Paris Marseille and Toulouse, Lille is much much littler than Toulouse
Two thumbs DOWN, for not pronouncing kilometer properly!
It may be a cultural thing but the lack of punctuation and reasonable pauses between sentences makes it very hard listening. In fact your narration skills are beyond a form of gabble. Breath and relax please.
This is long and drawn out. We need more "voids"  for solitude and peace. Not just for humans, but for life itself.
because France sucks. NEXXXXXXXXT
You act like this can be explained entirely by modern phenomenon, but it's hardly a coincidence that these 3 urbanized regions directly correlate with the 3 biggest french regions, which at a lot of points in history were relatively (or fully) independant. Those being Ile-de-France (the north), Aquitaine (Occitan country in the south west), and Burgandy (mountains in the southeast).
Why do we have the habit of thinking that something is wrong when a region of a country is devoid of copious amounts of people?
Very few countries have even population densities across their territory.  You could do an analogous story about almost any country, IMHO
Je vis dans cette partie et c'est le paradis  Nous sommes propriétaires pour pas cher avec 1 hectare de terre  Aucune criminalité parcequ'il n'y a pas de musulmans  Nous faisons nos élevages  Nous avons des millions d'hectares de forêts pour chasser  Le confinement du covid ne nous a pas empêché d'être libre dans nos forêts et nos rivières  Les jeunes partent car ils sont stupides et ont une mentalité d'esclaves car quitter sa région paradisiaque  où l'on peut faire un salaire de 1500 euros par mois pour aller à Paris et gagner 2000 euros par mois c'est une perte totale d'économie vu les prix excessif à Paris et surtout la destruction de la qualité de vie   J'espère que les jeunes continueront a partir que les vieux resteront et quand ils seront morts j'aurais toute la région pour moi seul et je fonderai mon propre pays
Kinda proves that there is plenty of land for people to move if need be
Well France is Black now. And now that people know that part of france is empty.... More people are going to come floating in a dingy.
Massive nothing burger
always a sign of poor output of our education system when people say something reduced 4x instead of saying the working population of farmers dropped 75%  you dont reduce by multiplying.. you instead measure in fractions /percentage lost.
@RealLifeLore there is no state of Palestine never has been thus you're talking utter codswallop. In any case Palestine is a name given by the Romans for a Jewish sect Philistines. The nation is called Israel and was formerly Judea and Samaria in pre biblical times. Unsure where you got the outlandish idea Palestine is a state 😂😂😂😂😂🇮🇱
So the interior of the country has emptied out as people prefer to live by the sea, yet Paris clearly the largest population center in the whole country is not close to the sea
Kalergi would be proud
I don't buy it. After a few days, it sounds so ridiculous: that claim that France once was the most populous country and suffered from disproportionate decline. With no explanation why it ended up as the most populous country in the first place. France being bigger than Germany or even Russia. Come on. That's Gallic propaganda. France didn't even exist as a united country, and when it existed, it wasn't a hexagon for most of its time. France had to conquer Alsace-Lorraine and to ensure la ligne Oder-Neiße to make sure, it's bigger than Germany. And then only by territory, not by population, because Eastern Germans now live à l`ouest de la ligne Oder-Neiße.
punaise mais vive la france
short answer: Mountains, a f*ckton of
Nope! France is a pentagon, not a hexagon.
Lozere sounds like how French would say loser. No wonder it's not populated:)
Thanks for sharing all these places so I can fantisise about living in the french country side.
>Demography is destiny >Video is still listed
thank  you .    ( 2022 / June / 10 )
FYI, it is the State of Israel, not Palestine.
That just sounds like a great place to move. I don’t have to deal with other humans.  Sign me up.
What enrages me is that France is clearly a pentagon
It's all because the money you guys have looted from African and South asian countries...  Would be dumped at last if they dont have that money
Another learning surprise! Thanks 😊
Empty of the overpopulated human primayes doesn't mean an area is empty.
If you drew a line a long the old vichy line from west to east into Alsace you'll find most French North of the border have a German heritage and the southern are pretty much dagos lol and that comes from an English man with an Anglicised French surname lol!
Bollox, I live in the ariege...
hmm...i always figured maybe the land was contaminated from the WWI poisons.
Isnt that just called rural countryside, what a nonsense topic for a video
I fly regularly over this area, flying between Amsterdam and Toulouse and I noticed these vast empty areas. In the Netherlands, the most densely populated European country by far (apart from the "City States") we can hardly cope anymore with the stream of refugees coming into or country on a weekly basis. And there you have all the space in the world.
Your informational quality is bad
11 minutes of my life that I will never get back! I want my 11 minutes back!!!
Why is it so important to live in each others pocket? Thank goodness I have piece of land to hide from people on and not have to share my space when I dont feel like it..the noise would be insane!
The governments want people in large urban areas, goelocked and not moving.
I’ll take the rural area over the densely populated areas anytime!
Sh*t. I thought this was going to explain "Why 1/3rd of France is Almost Empty". So far, I got 8 minutes of history and nothing yet on "Why 1/3rd of France is Almost Empty". Can you refund me the 8 useless minutes you stole from me?
This is where I chose to buy my house and where I've been happily living in a village with a population of 40. I love it here!
Your explanation is frankly too complicated. Went around the bushes and actually you never went to the point.
Oh good Lord; look at the US between the Mississippi and the Rockies.  Makes this look like Japan.
Wait.. where's palestine?
Bit of a pointless video, he even admits it at the end.
There is no " State of Palestine".
Well ..... maybe it could be like, you know, farmland .
There is no such thing as "State of Palestine "
That means there is space for nature to thrive. Wildlife is being squeezed out everywhere.
Who knew farmland and mountains are less populated than most regions? Amazing!
As you promised, I'm still waiting on this to become interesting.......
Well you know what they say, France is a beautiful country, but unfortunately there are French people in it 🤷🏽‍♀️😁
Narrator: *Stresses the French pronunciation of every French city he names* Also Narrator: "PAR-is"
You lost me at the opening. "France is one of Europe's and one of the world's most significant countries." Really? Put this in the past tense, and I would agree. But even their most iconic symbol, the Eiffel Tower, was widely opposed by the people. Even their wine production was saved from total destruction from phylloxera by importing root stock and replacement varietal cuttings from California. France today? Yawn.
Why is the middle of any country empty?  There’s usually for whatever reason, nothing there.
das ist halt nicht korrekt, deutschland und england waren dominanter
Any way. If you come in France don't forget to visit Lozère. It's gorgeous. Best moment is summer.
Few people live in farmland. That's not the same as saying the area is a "void."
Because globalization has destroyed rural life across the world?
How is france nearly identical in size to india? India is nearly 5 times larger ( france 632.733,9 km², india 3.287.263  km²)
I am French and I live in this area, far from the metropolises. Nothing is missing, from nature to high-speed internet. Vive la France.
Auguste Comte also said "Les morts gouvernent les vivants monsieur Attali"
Shame France became what it is now...
Oh, no, one third of France is almost empty!  Spain with almost a half: *hold my cervecita*
there is no empty part of France territory what is this hoax ? have you ever been in France to say such a stupidity ?
the reference to palestine is stupid because there is no such palce
Yeah, try this idea with Canada or Russia.
And there are, you know, the mountains of the Massif Central, which literally means "the central mountains". A bit tough to build cities there.
So France's less populated areas are the reason for its diminished geo-political influence?  Also that "empty area" line you drew through Spain included Madrid... Spain's largest city.  This video had so much potential, but it was a rambling disorganized mess that didn't have any message.
So why are so many migrants risking there lives leaving France and crossing the channel in small boats to get to over populated England with a land mass smaller than  this area and less arable land
La diagonale du vide est très mal dessinée... On ne peut guère y mettre le sud-ouest de la France...
there is no "state of Palestine".
One of the reasons of low densité population is also : the "massif central" which is Hugo and right at the center of France.
It's almost empty, yet it supplies about 90% of  the French rugby team
This theory is largely  considerate false  today! The pays basque is very attractive today !
A third of France is empty? That’s amateur stuff. Check out Australia, twice as big & two thirds a ghostland LOL.
Per title as per Google Earth ?
wrong information.. size of france 543,940 km² and india is 3.287 million km²
it is not, and has never been, an issue.
What a lousy video.
People want to live where the opportunities and amenities are, so cities just have what most people want, for the majority of their lives. Even when you retire access to medical facilities and public transport is desirable and country villages just don't have that. On the plus side that leaves some great countryside available for those who do want that lifestyle.
That's OK.  It's cool.  I will go live in Biarritz all alone with nobody else.  It sucks there and nobody should ever visit.  🤞
There is no "state of Palestine".
Identical in size to India???? Really!?
1:20 an even more surprising fact is that 60% of oklahoma resides in the capital oklahoma city. 60% of the state lives in 1 city and its suburbs. thats just nuts to me.
France killed millions of innocent people throughout its history... I hope people also mention in each video whatever the topic is about france.... Can't forget the atrocities of France...
France has too much farmland with old-fashioned farming, which means that it receives the most EU subsidies in proportion.  The EU money is not used to motivate the French peasants to modernize but to keep the peasant families alive.
2:45, the state of palestine is found only on imaginary maps, same with that obviously fake population of 5 million people. stop parroting things please.
What the flip are you talking about. or as i suspect you are just reading from a script... Hmm quote at 0:15 France same size as India....  France Area • Total 	643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi)[5] (42nd) India Area • Total 	3,287,263[2] km2 (1,269,219 sq mi)[d] (7th) Wikipedia.... so about 5 times smaller and only 35 other larger countries in between.. Hmm god know what you say about your manhood :)  Drops mike and stops watching..
Is that 'empty' area where the World Wars took place? I have read that there are areas of France where no one is allowed to live because of major mustard gas contamination from WWI.
Brilliant? Actually America is divided into Countries, 35 of them: the U.S. is 1 of 23 countries in North America and its divided into States. United States is a country. America is 35 countries.
If l lived in France that's where I'd live. You can always visit the city's if you have to.
So what's wrong with the serenity of a peaceful countryside?
200 people per kilometer.... damn canada is 4......
OK, interesting. But "four times less," not Brilliant!
@2:48 uh, is Palestine a state?
Stopped watching the minute you mentioned "Palestine" - no such place! Also marked do not suggest channel!
I stopped watching when you compared this area to “the state of Palestine”.
State of Palestine? never heard of it. could you be confusing Israel with this palestine place?
Well most of this "empty space" is mountain regions... Big cities (for European pov) are engulfed in this empty spaces too, the south west part is rather dense, the rest are crops. 20% of the French population is located in Ile-de-France which includes Paris and solely represent 2% of the country land. People flocks to where jobs are. If best paid jobs were numerous all over the country, people would happily spread out.
Is it lost on geographers that the shape resembles a buxom woman’s shape. Those French….so crazy
Only 30 people per square km. A person from Siberia: "Damn, aren't you guys crowded?"
France is not a great power and has not been since WW1. This became painfully apparent during the Suez crisis.
wait.... thats considered empty? *sweats nervously in US midwestern*
Didn’t you mean Fakestine?
Because the Khazistan Mafia has them all herded into cities like sheep
This is actually good. Wildlife and human-empty spaces are neccesary, for humans and other living beings. 100% proud Argentina's 16 habitants per Km2.
Palestine is a state?  Is the rest of the video also BS?
I was invited to stay with friends in the southwest region of France, the Aquitaine, along the coast in a small town called Mimizan. It was rather remote, surrounded by pine forests and farms, lovely beaches, and no crowds. I felt like it was in a small town on Lake Michigan (I'm from east lower peninsula Michigan). About 50-60 mi south and you were in the Pyrenees/Biarritz area
Moving To Lozère!
Was expecting this would be about the "Zone Rouge" situation where the effect of poison gas and explosives from the 1st and 2nd World Wars have made large areas uninhabitable.
Paris has fallen. I wouldn’t even bother if i were you tourists!
I was curious about the title but... how can you dispense such inaccurate information and try to make it pass as "knowledge"???  - your division of the country is odd : 40/60 is only obtained because you count Paris, the capital, in it. Paris alone can explain the 20 percent difference - usually and historically, we divide the country between south and North, using the river Loire as a divider, because not only the architecture changes but also the language; the south as a whole is more populated than the rest of the country if you exclude the capital from the perspective - the bottom west part including the atlantic coast is in no way shape or form less habited or attractive : it is one of the most touristic and sought after places, as is the whole south of France, because the climate is much warmer. - the "middle part" in your selected area is inherently less populated... because it is mountains XD Please, there are foreigners who do their diligent researches and whose perspective is delightful... dont' bother posting something if it's made out crap.
See you have not been to northern scandinavia
The country is France, not "Frence"
Please, for the love of god and all that is sacred, at least put the metric conversions... squared body parts vs the distance a fart travels in the wind is not understandable measurements
Por que nadie quiere vivir en francia
..Where is the "state of Palestine"..? (2:46)  Never heard of it. ¯\_(°_°)_/¯
STate of Palestine????NO such thing so obviously the rest of this film is bullshit
There is no such thing as the state of Palestine
Wrong title. This "diagonal of the void" is only a statistical curiosity. When you drive through the French countryside, you pass from one region to another without seeing any noticeable difference, except perhaps a smaller number of large cities...
In Sweden 90% of the population lives on or south of the 60th paralell
very interesting apart from the fact about palestine the state of palestine does not exist
Between 1917 & 1922 France lost 4 million people do to WW1 & disease. US had 125,000 men killed in 6 months of WW1 in 1918. And the world had outbreak of Spanish flu & small pox. These killed more than covid!
state of palestine?
State of palestine?
would you live in France given the choice hell no
I’ve always wondered why also.
The southwestern part bordering Spain (Bayonne-Biarritz area), the coast does not fit in the "Empty Region" as marked over here, just the space next to the pyrenees, not next to the sea. Also the expansion to Spain is a bit laughable. The Basque country and Madrid which you marked in the zone, are two of the top places in spain with the highest population densities in the country.
Funfact... a little germany could destroy france... wasnt that funny.
Clermont-Ferrand. So I call bullshit
India is about 4 times the size of France
Incase the Germans invade the French plan is to trap them In that part of the country
The inner part of Spain IS worse
from 00.04 - that's Denmark, tho..
Make it easier for the Germans next time
Thanks for putting your ad at the end.
Blah, blah... Just look at the 3D map of France, study the physical geography, and you will quickly understand why everything is much more complicated in these regions than in others.
They’ve got that huge military yet Africans invade without consequence
Toulouse: I am a joke to you?
You forgot our Départements et Territoires outre-mer. There are people and activity in Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane (from where we launch our space rockets), La Réunion, Saint-pierre -et-Miquelon, Mayotte, Saint-Barthélémy, Saint-Martin, Wallis-et-Futuna, Polynésie Française and Nouvelle Calédonie. These territories are not very populated with only 4% of our population, but represent 17,9% of our lands. And of course, we have the second largest naval territory in the world, right after United States of America. Coasts : 18450Km in total, including 5953km for the hexagone. The total surface is 10.2 Million km².
Scotland is mostly empty. Likewise Canada.
> X times less  what does that mean? 1/X times as much? -X+1 times as much? something else entirely?
Fixing people not wanting to work in rural farm industry? Just subsidise their salary so they could afford a decent living and luxuries of the city, so that those who are willing to escape city are able to work a humble but important job. That would flow more cash into rural areas, which in turn would increase touristic attraction, and let people who can work remotely to move there to sustain everything.
Why are this guy’s videos so bad? He never answers the question why this specific zone is the source of problems developing in France like he suggested at the beginning. Expanding the zone towards Spain literally went through Madrid which is the biggest population center. So many grammatical errors as well.    And I say videos because of the completely misleading video he did on the California High Speed rail which he took down after he was called out (look up “California High Speed Rail has not Failed and RealLifeLore is wrong” to see what I’m talking about).   You need to hold yourself to higher standards if you’re making a living out of this with 5+ million subs. This is just embarrassing. Won’t be watching any more of your videos when they’re suggested by YouTube.
Empty of what? My god this is so humancentric..
You seem to envision low density as as problem. But in the world we're heading for, it is much more of a blessing than a curse !!!
I live in that diagonal and would not move away for anything.
Taking out Wales &  Scotland, England is bursting at the seams. That's why I voted Brexit, but will that stop politicians, trying to climb the biggest economy league table? We've had joke interest rates for 15 years. Lend enough money to buy a Rolls, get enough back to buy a Merc. Why would you do that?
Looks like it might be a "Farming Hinterland" combined with nature preserves?
Lol you should do this same analysis for Australia
Palestine is not a state
Wow… a country is not uniformly populated. And the population is increasingly urbanized. Wow… a country is not uniformly populated. That’s so… normal. There’s nothing in this video that couldn’t be said about other country. Yawn.
Realy?? Pakastine? The country that does not exits? In the judaia and sumeria live 2.5 milon arabs snd 500000 jews. Not 5 milion and not palastine.
I'd say that this is more a statistical fluke than an actual thing (as in "people actively avoided this area historically").  France is a rather maritime country with lots of population living on the coast (as they do in most countries with long coastlines) and one big capital metro that swallows up a lot of the rest.  So there just isn't that much population left to start with (most non-coastal rural areas in France have the same low population density), and if you then proceed to draw crooked lines around the few remaining population centers you get this seemingly "empty" area.  But frankly, you can do the same for most countries. Spain would be exactly the same if the capital didn't happen to be in the middle of the country.
isn't that region terribly mountanous...
Not even the French want to live there!
These empty structure is a non sense. We can easily draw a lot of other structure with even less density, like every country in the world. Just to see at 1:37 to see as stupid it is. Why not Bretagne, its the same. or between alsace and rhone, the same too. or others ... its just no sense.
Excuse me. At 2:45 you are referring to the state of Palestine. Is that a real country or is that just make-belive, like Azeroth or Kurdistan? 🙂
World super power ? Don’t make me laugh ! Macron is the laughing stick of Europe 😂
I wish more of France was empty
I wonder how much 'blame' can be landed at the revolution in communication. With minimal connectivity, anyone can access the wealth of information the world has to offer & see how the other half lives. Used to watch a reality show about an African village's daily life. Watched one young man exit a mud hut, then get on his mobile phone to try negotiate a dowry of cattle with a neighbouring village to get married. It was so strange, they had to go into the nearest large town to charge the phones, but they had coverage. Line from a song: 'If I hadn't seen such riches I could live with being poor.'
I think this video is partly solid reasoning and partly cherry picking. The valid point is that rural areas are losing out on population. The cherry picking thing is that the area with the lowest population density is taken and then you try to turn it to an interesting shape by taking a path along areas with low population density, carefully avoiding the bigger urban centers.  Also no matter how you divide France in two. The area containing Paris is most likely to have the higher population.
i am  a proud french living in the "diagonal du vide" just  near  some old dead volcano
What about the Red Zone? That diagonal also encompasses land poisined by WWI. There is still live ordinance (latest estamates are 300 years to get it all picked up ( see also iron harvest)) and the very nasty Mustard, Distilled Mustard, and other chemical weapons that are still persistant and acess to areas is denied to French Citizens.
how the hell do you not know how to pronounce "Belarus"?
this video was boring as fuck lol
Aaah Le Havre, my dear hometown..
why does everything have to be a dense, judeo marxist driven third world city?
its because they are making room for the german settlement
La diagonale du vide, this is how it was called. I come from one of these départements, the beautiful Lot. Very paradoxical because the Lot villages were heavily populated up to WW1.  And now things are changing fast again, with covid and remote work reshuffling the cards.
Less people makes better places.
And yet still they cross the Channel in boats.
There is no state called Palestinian
because they send all the refuges to the uk , they aren't as stupid as us
France is nowday mocked for their defeat in WW2 but when you consider that france has being at war almost every century for more than a thousand year it show its resistance.
Depopulation in the rural areas in the 19th and 20th centuries? Reference to the Industrial Revolution would help here. It didn't just happen to France. Drops in birthrate are more due to Industrialization than war---men aren't the ones who give birth. It might be noticed that France's dominance in Europe was blunted by the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and the creation of the new nations of Germany and Italy. But, of course, you should know all of this since you are "Brilliant."
France is a ZOO
Easy for my country Australia -1. Almost the entire population lives on or near the coast and 2. 80%live in or near to the major metropolitan areas.  1. is  geographic (stay close to ports, to the amenities of the coast and to milder climate and good rainfall)2. is the post industrial economy. - (the jobs are there because the people are there so big cities suck in more people than small ones which in turn suck in more people than rural areas [which mostly decline]) Great video btw.
This doesn’t sound so bad for global warming
I'm in my 30's and I just moved to france the less populated area, and it's awesome :D
nearly identical in size to india. huh?
Comparison and wtf, and biased. People live where it's easier to do. That country is populated since multiple 10k years... people simply adapted to the space. And this trait is not a reason of decline 0:40. conclusion is pure bullshit.
I don't think using Palestine as any sort of benchmark for population density is helpful.
There is more space give to golf courses in greater London than for residential property.
"Palestine" is not a "state."
The city of Los Angeles has hundreds of vacant buildings and the worst Skid Row. Go figure!
There is another reason for this : the old mountainous and volcanic région Of Massif Central, which is a huge  natural barreer, in middle of this band. Less people, less roads, towns  on a large surface. And, in the south east, les Landes is a large forest without any town, between Bordeaux and Basque Country...
They even offer EU subsidies money to life there.
France is a great power? Has France ever won a war? Victory for Ukraine 💙💛💙💛💙💛
Try visiting rural Suffolk- if you can squeeze in 😒😂
Because its France ....
You make it look like it’s crap to live in this diagonal but it’s actually very good. I  wish everyone to be born in Lozere near the sheeps, the fields, and the good traditional life with great food and beautiful landscapes !!!
Did you see how sparsely populated Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur is? Southeastern corner
You should do a video on Egypt's rising power and massive military purchases
Well that was interesting.
This guy loves to talk and seems to want to impress the listener as to how much he knows, even if unrelated to the topic. Fast forward to at least to the 7 minute mark to start listening. Frustrating.
“Almost empty”? LoL
one in four were french,,, * shudders in european*
Why is this a problem?    Why would people need to live in rural areas?
there is no such thing as palestinian state
State of Palestine?
Does that diagonal zone arrives and cross Belgium, he Nederlands and go further?
To be fair you can draw arbitrary lines on any country and find a large area that's not very densely populated. But still well researched as always!
Austrias population is also very unequal distributed because of large mountain areas which are unocupied. In Germany in the middle of Germany there is also a large low density area
No mention of climate. Or topography apart from a vague 'mountainous'.
I live close to Paris and I'm actually planning to move to the diagonal. Housing there is cheaper, the landscape is beautiful, there's less noise, pollution, stress
“Empty” Lolllll New Zealand has a density of 18 per Km squared. For the whole country!
Probably because all the migrants are now in England.
Ich bin maßlos entäuscht über dieses Video, anstatt gute Gründe zu nennen, gibt es nur allgemeine Pfürze wie Verstädterung und ... `? Aber wenigstens gabs einen kleinen historischen Einblick über die Bevölkerungzahl Frankreichs im Vergleich zum restlichen Europa
I just can't handle the awful pronunciation of place names in almost every video this guy does. Bel-air-iss? Seriously?
France has been one of the most centralized countries in Europe ever since it came into being. Germany on the other hand has only existed for 150 years roughly and the hundreds of semi independent principalities of the hre meant a very decentralized region with unmatched balance between urban and rural across the country.
Because no internet there xD
Good, we don’t need cities covering the whole planet. Some people enjoy the quiet life.
All of this bullshit just to set up an advertisement
I still need 80% to pay. Nope.
Empty void, with great climate and lifestyle in the South...
Really interesting video Merci beaucoup :)
Is really *every* video of this channel bad??
not enough baguettes
Hello from the void diagonal
Yawn! Has this narrator ever been to Nevada or Wyoming?
@8:03 * FEWER workers are needed (Damn it!)
"only 30 person per square kilometer". That's a lot, sincerely Finland
That's not the reason. Look at geography  and water availability, I bet that "empty zone" has always been under populated.
I grew up in Lozère. I don't live there anymore, but still in the empty diagonal. it's nice. There's forests and cows. And fiber optic internet. Nothing to complain about.
Mistake: England is even crazier and has a pop density of 400-500 pkm, 270 is for the entire UK
Empty because no job no school.
A highway for Germany to blitz Spain, the next time.
The variety of relief, geography in France is unique in the World for a such tiny surface.
My parents moved to Brittany about 5 years ago and while it's not within the empty diagonal, their area is definitely mostly countryside.  When I visit it's a nice break from the city, a busy job and people in general. Coming back is always weird, going from just hanging out with family in their tiny village to busy and bustling streets. Going between both makes me appreciate both ways of living, but also puts me in limbo because I don't know where I want to live forever.
TLDR: It's farmland
you sound like al gore
Seems I have to watch the whole video to get the answer to the question. No thanks. Perhaps the less populated area is the better area, and France should strive to match this across the whole country eventually. Humans and our livestock (cattle, sheep etc) are causing huge environmental damage, catastrophic climate change, and biodiversity loss. A lower human population is something to strive for. Thinking about having a family? Don't feel it is compulsory, and if you do, feel free to stop at one child.
Palestine is not a state
What “State of Palestine”?  If you can’t get even Geography and Politics right, or can’t keep your delusional views of the world away from an explanation about France, why should anyone listen to your garbage?
There’s some surprising errors here.  Belarus, really?  France is divided up like US states? No. The States came together to form a nation—the nation did not divide up the land into states, it’s actually pretty different.
How did you manage to compare France to India. LOL
Swathes of the country that have very low populations? *Laughs in Australian*
what Scraping the Barrel conscription law does to a mf
I am in the state of Georgia in the US and we have a very similar issue.  The bottom and westernmost half of the state is all farms.  The northernmost quarter of the state is mountains. The population centers range on an axis alongside the foothills, splitting the rural population into two.   Atlanta dominates with millions of people in its metropolitan area, but Augusta, Columbus, and Macon are all along the population axis.  Savannah is major coastal city and the southernmost of the major population hubs, connected by railway and interstate to Augusta, Macon, and Atlanta.  Unfortunately, because of the way state politics prioritizes land over people, the politics of the state remains dominated by the interests of those in the less populated areas.  Only in the most recent election were the city folk able to overcome with pure numbers, letting have a voice in the federal government, at least.
'cause it's the back end of nowhere with garlic and wine! Not much going on there then?
The grass always looks greener where you don't live: people living in cities crave about the calmness and security of areas like the diagonal of void whereas people living there crave about the health/educational/cultural infrastructures of cities. The best compromise to me are midsize cities like Clermont-Ferrand, Pau or Besançon: not yet a direct TGV line connection to Paris (so housing prices do not skyrocket too much), but plenty of cultural offer as well as universities which keep the city alive at night. And nature is a 15 min hop by car, bus or train.
Where is a state of Palestine?
ça s'appelle le massif central et tous les français ne sont pas des loeb en puissance, combiné à un manque d'infrastructures (transport, school, hospitaux , connexion fibre optique) justifié par les pouvoirs publics par une faible densité de population.
Most of Scotland is empty ,approx the same population as 1922.
Laughs in Belgian where population density is cut between North and South (Flemish and Wallonnia) and in Wallonnia in the cities around rivers (Charlerois/Namur/Liege/Dinant/Spa/Verviers/Bastogne) but also due to geographical features. Flanders=Flat Wallonnia is not mountainus.. but vallonated where the name Wallonnia comes from actually. (Also the Ardennes is empty lol)
le haaaaf :D:DD:D:D:D::d;
Most of the world is unpopulated.
I moved out of the London to the country. The best decision of my life
Ah yes , the "Diagonale du vide" 😂
I really hate these fake ass ads all these Youtube channels do. Dude is acting like he been using that program for years and changed his life yada yada. Ironic how that's always the case haha. Like its so disingenuous to the point id never buy the product or anything you recommend after hearing it even once. Just give me the speal without the blatant lies with a smiling voice haha
Shit I'll take a 100 acres and few pretty French women and we will change that population figure... For that one square km at least ;) my dream is a 100-200 acre compound in middle of nowhere. Been saving for a few years. Got about 15-20 left haha
Why are there almost no people in certain places in France ? It's simple: no jobs, no doctors, virtually no public services, no post office, no public transport, no shops, etc. Give people work and facilities, and they will be happy to come and live in these beautiful surroundings. It is a matter of political choice.
all of Europe is experiencing a drop in birthrates. At the same time they are being replaced by millions of migrants who refused to assimilate.
Me: literally if you draw the correct lines i guess almost every country will have an “empty” area 😂😂
Haha New Zealand has a population density of 18 people per sq km
Thanks a lot! Very impressiv!
Go to Wyoming, then we'll talk.
10% of Russia live in Moscow…
Comparing the low population density of a *sub-region* of one country to the population density of *the whole* of other countries (Germany and England) is a case of "apples and oranges", and an example of cherry-picking data that's convenient; those other countries also have low-density sub-regions (e.g. the north of England, and most of the former East Germany despite reunification). The same selective statistics goes for (a) population losses (many other European nations were impacted by the continent's multiple wars over the past two centuries, notably Germany/Prussia/Austria-Hungary, Poland, and Russia where losses were significantly higher over the same period of time); and (b) demographic shifts from rural/agricultural to industrial/urban areas, a global trend that is hardly unique to France...a takeaway buried @8:54 despite leading @0:36 with the misleading setup that "partially because of ['the empty diagonal'] France has been diminishing for centuries and continues to do so".
So what? All developed, first world countries, have an urban population over 80%, some over 90%
Every country needs areas that are less inhabited. What is with this kind of video?
So much of pretentious British blah blah.
why pronounce the name of every city correctly except for Paris ?
Never heard France being named 'L'Hexagone..
Hi! I'm from France and more espacialy from Lozère! We have a place named Causse Mejean , less populated, in density then Mongolia or even Lapland !  Lozère is the best département of France!  <3
A video that explains nothing but the obvious
Lol, you want empty, try driving across Canada. You can go 1,000’s of km and see nothing but moose and beaver.
I kinda expected that the low population areas of France also had to do with the deadly religious wars between catholics and the Huguenots and the front line of the first world war. War drives people away. The 80 year war of the Dutch against the Spanish caused the population from belgium to flee to the Netherlands, which benefitted us greatly. Which is partly why we are so densely populated.
There's no such nation as "Palestine"
Definitely think they should do a super highway from Spain through France into Germany and thus create business opportunities and tourism near the highway exits
That diagonal looks like a great place for canal and rail for shipping and rail and mega international highway for people and low density would make it great for farm land orchards and factories and large businesses and low density would make land cheaper and more affordable for home ownership and vacation homes and people wanting a slower lifestyle
I will take one for the team and live there
Beach-front property in France without landmines. 👌
One thing the area has! Empty houses!
There Is No state of palestine
Does France call its middle part the flyover zone as the US does?
6:30 1. No tourism industry, 2. Almost no wine industry, 3. Almost no coastline, 4. Agricultural mechanization.
The _State_ of Palestine?  Did I miss a global geopolitical newsflash?
There is no state of Palestine.
The European part of France ("France métropolitaine") which is what you're talking about here, isn't divided into 18 regions.  It only has 13 regions (12 + Corsica); the other 5 are in other parts of the world.
What are "stem subjects"?
Well done
More it advance, more we are put aside...Sadly
It's funny they refer to an area with 30 people / km. as "empty". For comparison, the US state of Wyoming has 2.3 people / km. and the state of Alaska has 0.5 people / km.!
in england, the coastal areas are actually some of the most deprived. there's a seasonal economy in those areas and they rely heavily on tourism – but with england's generally poor weather, there isn't a lot actually keeping people there in winter months. and the people who do live there year-round are essentially pushed out by outsiders who have gentrified the areas – the tourists buying second homes.
Its empty because its a Shit Hole, period.
Whenever I go abroad I'm shocked how chaotic and over crowded Britain is.
Good place to put all those illegal immigrants trying to cross the channel!!!
I live in the empty void.
You have to talk of the world superpowers and world diplomacy ....  I am sure that this ( superpowers and diplomacy) video would surely be successful if properly edited and said .........   Thanks , real life lore is always interesting  ..
How can the thumbnail place Toulouse in the diagonal even though it’s the fourth biggest city in the country and one of the most dynamic?
"An empty VOID?" What an ugly, venal point of view. You make it embarrassing to be from the US
Don't worry very soon all that empty land will be filled up to the rim with people from Africa and the Middle East.
The "state of Palestine"??? What's that?
What's with saying everything twice? “Rural countryside”, “prior history”, “plummeted down”? This may be some of the strangest use of English I've ever heard. Sorry, this here must apparently be quite some of the strangest weird English language that I myself have ever heard in my life before. Um, insert a friendly emoji here, I'm merely puzzled, not trying to be unkind.
u cant invent a non existing name to a country its called israel. and it will remain israel.
France is in the third tier of powerful Nations.    USA is alone on top.  China arguably is a moment second.  Russia, Britain ,  Japan Germany  and California Tie France in third.
What State of Palestine? What is the capital of that state? What is the official currency? Do you mean Israel? Wow! You are teaching geography and history? Or just looking for controversy to increase your views?
It actually sounds like a nice place to live for those who are more independent and want to get away from being around too many people.
The State of Palestine?
wHy dHo yHou tHalk lHike tHis?
Why did the narrator not refer to the geography of France?
Netherlands 517 p/km^2 and the midwestern provincies averaging 1000 go brrr 😬
No, it's not empty, people are living and working there. You provide false and fake information.
The French are just too lazy to work any more land than they absolutely need to.
You should give that empty teritory to Albanian shepards...they would soon made it independence country...
Nearly identical in size to India?? Wtf?
That mountain
And not only the government isn't adressing ht eissue, it's even aggravating it. I live in a small town lost in the mountains where we had the chance to have all kinds of public services, an hospital, a school system form kindergarten to university, postal services, gaz and electricity offices and services, public finances, etc..  Now, we have the schools and the postal office, that's it, for everything else, you need to go at a minimum of 35km away, and once again, we are lost in the mountains, and for some services, it's 70km away.  We technically still have the hospital, but if we have something serious, we either need to go to the department capital, 60km away, or if it's really serious, either in the next department capital, more than 100km away, or at Lyon, almost 200km away.... And by the way, we use Swiss helicopter to move there in case of emergency because they completely stopped using French helicopters in our region....  In my town, 3/4 of the big companies we had shut down in the last decade, if we were not close to the Swiss border, the town would be completely dead by now. And that's actually the case during the week ends, sometimes you can spend the two days not seeing a single car or person outside, even though we are on the only road to Switzerland.  Oh, and they are talking about shutting down the train line which has only 3 trains/day. Which connects us directly to the three biggest cities in the department, and brings us a lot of tourists every years. While increasintaxes on fuel and telling people to use public transports....
As a person who lives right in the middle of the void diagonal, yes, it's empty
France wasn't the only country whose male population was decimated by the 20th century World Wars. The UK lost 7% of its male population in freeing France twice.
because the people developed common sense and moved to better countries
Well , it isnt empty. Parts may be less densely populated than other bits of France but it's not empty. The base is in the Pyrennes, the middle is the Central Massif and the tip is the Ardennes.  All specific geographical features that reduce population densities.  You want to see empty, go to the Poles, Siberia or central Australia.
Hate it when people hide lies in something unconnected in a subtle attempt, by the presenter or his backers, to present Palestine as a real place with a history and distinct people like the British or Japanese to discredit the legitimate existence of Israel. But there is no, and never has been a, state called Palestine where Israel, the WB, Jordan or Gaza is now. The Palestinian historian Muhammad Y. Muslih, said that during the entire Ottoman rule “There was no political unit known as Palestine.”
This kind of felt a bit click baitish.... boooo
I like my quiet little corner of SW France after living in London for 20 years.
Good thing to be empty for wild life
España ganó siempre a Francia. Ejemplo ,  Batalla de San Quintín, batalla de Bailen a Napoleón y luego las guerrillas , Francia perdió las guerras mundiales, Petain perdió la Francia de los Aliados.    Argelia, Vietnam.  Perdió parte de Canadá , Quebec. La Luisiana. Mexico.  Imperio francés es efímero.
There is only 13 regions in France
So many factual errors.
'Palestine' is no state.
Wish I lived there ,peace countryside heaven
the second largest city in france is in this area. clickbait nonsense channel
Palestine is not a state
The solution is making it socially and economically beneficial for people to live and have families in the countryside while not subsidising over breeding.
According to Wikipedia, India is 6 times larger than France. And the population working in agriculture is a quarter of what it was, not "four time less".
This pseudo-documentary wasn't "brilliant" at all. Yes, agricultural regions are less populated; big discovery.
Palestine look vastly different than that. I see you favor the zionist / Imperialist apartheid loving Isreal
A bit part of that area in the center is a huge old chain of Mountains.   Not usable.  Unlike the alps a newer chain of mountain preferred for skying and tourism.   The north east part of your band is very rural and very cold in the winter.  Not many businesses.  The very north part was mining.  A dying business. People had to migrate to other areas.
Is it just an American phenomena then that lately there's been a trending exodus from major cities? Over here in Washington State large amounts of people are fleeing the Seattle area for suburbs out in the "wilds". They're trying to escape the congestion, cost of living, and increasing crime rates, but in doing so they're just bringing all of that with them to wherever they move to.
Try to keep things wild and wild empty spaces for nature To be alone… Not everything has to be occupied allow nature to run her course

Wrong. most of Germany and all of Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, and Czechia (or Czech Republic) are far from the sea, which contradicts the "sea coast" model. There are two likely reasons for the latter countries success despite a lack of seacoast.   1. Internal navigation by navigable rivers, such as the Rhine and the Danube. 2. Local autonomy. Until 1918, southern and central Germany contained two dozen independent governments who were merely members of a largely voluntary federation. Bavaria, Baden, and the many Thuringian states could govern as they pleased and had their own armies. Switzerland is little more than a federation to this day. On the other hand, France is a highly centralized state. Local languages are suppressed and public policies dedicate resources to the politically powerful major cities. (The US has precisely the opposite political problem, with less populated states having too much influence over national priorities.)   By the way,, there is no "State of Palestine" as you claim -- the Oslo Accords specifically refer to conditions that must be met before the "State of Palestine" can be declared. The Palestine Authority refuses to adopt those conditions. Other conditions of the Accords, including but not limited to ending the state of war and adherence to international treaties, such as the Genocide Convention, are deliberately flouted. Most governments refuse to recognize this so-called "independent state" until a "final status" agreement is signed. Both sides have stopped negotiating.  Please remove this bit of fiction.
"Empty." No it isn't. "From one landlocked end to another landlocked end" Didn't realize the Atlantic Ocean was land. "The exact center of the empty area." No, it isn't. What needs to be fixed? No evidence has been presented regarding this. Waste of time.
"au" in french is pronounced like the letter 'o'. Auguste therefore sounds like "oguste" (just without the rolling of the letter that is very english-like)
So, basically, it's western Iowa.
'Empty'? Do you mean people don't live there? Leave France alone, it's fine as it is.
While France has lost world power (sorry), it gained peace and prosperity. Not a bad trade-off I say. It is a rare pleasure to be alone with nature in a vast forest you can rarely enjoy in Europe, let alone anywhere in Asia...
And we want to keep that empty space!
With most of it's population along the coastal areas I suspect California's inland percentage is equally low if not lower.
When will the creators of these fanciful, brighter than light, exquisitely European [white male dominated] false histories get it right. Think this is a time for truth vs white supremacy and i do believe that one fact frightens world governments all the way from the Ukraine: home of over 80% of Ashkenazi converts to Judaism 747ce to the occupied land given to the Ashkenazi converts to Judaism 747ce with the blessing of the whore who drinks the cup of filth and abominations, to the little whore America (Babylon) and all the allies that eat from her table and drink from the same abominable cup. Everything gentiles write, speak of, sing of their nations greatness is the antithesis of their orgins, actions. There is too much incompatibility with truth vs the nations lies (Jeremiah 16:19) Israel will never belong to Ashkenaz. It is incompatible with their origin and the promises made to Abraham.   Genesis 10:3,5 Yah taught Moses Ashkenaz is a gentile.  Same chapter verses 21-31 Ashkenaz not in the lineage of Shem.  Genesis 46: 8-27 list all the names of Ya'acob's who went into Egypt with him. Ashkenaz is not one of his sons.  Genesis 49 Jacob pronounces all the blessing and future failures of all his children. Ashkenaz is not listed as one of Jacob's descendants.  Exodus 1 list the names of the sons of Israel. Ashkenaz is not listed among the names of the sons of Israel.  Deuteronomy 33 Moses blesses the children of Israel. Foretelling their future's. Each path told to each specific tribe. The tribe of Ashkenaz is not mentioned.  Jeremiah 30:1-4. Yah said I will bring back Israel and Juda. Where is Israel? These Imposters claim only to be Juda. Where is Israel, the 10 northern tribes?  1 Chronicles 1:5-12 HNV — The sons of Yefet: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Yavan, and Tuval, and Meshekh, and Tiras. The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Difat, and Togarmah. The sons of Yavan: Elishah, and Tarshisha, Kittim, and Rodanim. The sons of Ham: Kush, and Mitzrayim, Put, and Kana`an. The sons of Kush: Seva, and Havilah, and Savtah, and Ra`mah, and Savtekha. The sons of Ra`mah: Sheva, and Dedan. Kush became the father of Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the eretz. Mitzrayim became the father of Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehavim, and Naftuchim, and Patrusim, and Kasluchim (from whence came the Pelishtim), and Kaftorim.  Revelations 2:9  Revelations 3:9  Matthew 1 list the names of the sons of Adam to Messiah.

this is a stupid post....just about every country will have areas that are sparsely populated.....even China & India, the world's two most populous countries.
A PLACE IS NOT EMPTY JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEVELOPED!
By empty you mean… nature? Fucking nature? There has to be natural spaces of land inhabited by animals are yall insane or what
In France, *la Creuse* is the cliché department of the low density diagonal, its biggest town *Guéret* is only 13k inhabitants populated.
I bet Giai is breathing a sigh of relief that there are so many such large areas with so few human.
So what? Where do you grow food instead of people?
no one ever called it l hexagone  wtf
Because their are no snails in this area and we all know the French are to lazy to move around to much to look for them.
Canada:  hahahahaha!
Yes France was a great country thanks to great leaders and laws made for workers! Now a few billionaire have their puppets elected thanks to mainstream medias that they own...money and fame come first before citizens well being and common wealth...sad world we living in 🤬
I do not understand why anyone ever talks about low density regions as though it’s a bad thing. If I lived in France, I’d want to live right in the empty center of that empty region. Imagine living in the Middle of Europe and not having to deal with the myriad toxic damages of humanity. Heaven. Access to everything, but you can still see the stars.
It seems Biarritz is inside this area. I have not been there, but I have been to San Sebastian. Judging by that definitely a place I would like to live. Beaches and lots of sea. Maybe not so warm though. France is just enormously big at least by European standards.
I currently live in this empty diagonal, at 10 kilometers of the Belgium frontier. I will never leave this quiet place where houses are cheaper than in most city of the country, where you can escape in nature as easily if you cross a road. I’ve been living and working for two years close to Paris, even if I earned more money back then and had more opportunities of entertainment, I would never go back there with all the noise, speed, anxiety. Life is more peaceful when you are in a quiet place where you do not need to run.  By the way, I think a lot of people share my vision now with the experiences of lockdown, we have seen in our city a lot of people from across the country wanting to leave the big cities.
now it's no longer "L'Hexagone", it's "L'Octogone" xD
lol what exactly is the "state of palestine"? and from where you got this false demographic data on it?
France looks like a pentagon.
The empty quarters are everywhere. Scotland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Roumania, Baltic states, Turkey…
Slow and bloated video
Not empty lol  N’importe quoi ces anglo-saxons  Je suis sur la jamais mis un pied en France 😂
My grandparents used to live there on farmers and I used to spend a lot of time there as a child. I'm Belgian (from near the French border) and it was a 6h drive to get there, was 40min from the nearest town which had a baker/butcher/newspapershop and a cafe, the nearest hospital and proper shop a couple hours away. I have fond memories of the place, playing in the fields, stealing horses from the nearest neighbour (we'd bring them back), getting lost in the countryside (once a farmer picked us up and took us to his place where we had dinner before he brought us back). It's been over a decade since I've been there but I imagine it's not much different from how I remember. Even now my French has a countryside twang to it that people always point out.
I just came home after a one month holiday driving in France. Yes, the “empty diagonal” is noticeable within France. But even more noticeable, and briefly mentioned in your video, is the shock of returning to busy, noisy, densely populated England. The roads seem permanently on the brink of total gridlock, there are people everywhere and everything seems to suddenly cost more. Give me Lozère any time.
I own property in central France and I can attest that the biggest reason for the emptiness is lack of jobs. Which is just how I like it and why I bought in this village, because I treasure my solitude when I go there, and compared to the nightmare that Paris has become, it’s a whole paradise in that tiny hamlet. One of my neighbors there minds the property most of the year when I’m not around, and she is one of the nicest kindest persons I have ever known. This is part of the beauty of that empty French space. Now compare that to nasty Paris!
People always live closer to coasts.  That’s why most of the US population is along the coasts, or two states inland.  Big cities are often on coasts.  Even Chicago is off a Great Lake.   It’s much the same in other countries as well.
Please don't say "four times less people" (when referring to how many people now work in agriculture). That wording is confusing so better to say it is now one quarter what it was to make obvious that it is smaller.
It would be interesting to study the population density of places with coast lines like France, Spain, Italy versus landlocked, like say Czech Republic, or any central European country.. For example most of the USA also lives within 100 miles of the border or coast line.
Civilization begins with farms and a source of fresh water. It ends without them.
All those wars were bankstered inspired of white Christian dupes killing other white christian dupes. That area of the least populated is probobly mostly white christian
If you want to talk about emptiness, there is this anamoly called Russia. I once heard in an interview from a Russian historian that there are areas of the country that are so vast and unpopulated, you could "ride (a horse) for months, and not really get anywhere".
What a loss of time ...
I’m moving there!
You talk about population loss in the WW1 but there's more death caused by the flu
I live in this "line". And believe me low density population is sweet, way better quality of life than in overpopulated cities.
France to the north east of paris in the ainse department is unbeleivable boring and cold in winter.
The French Alps is actually a good thing despite the area has low population density. The mountain terrains is what brings France the water it needed.
TL;DR: Chuck Norris walked there
Personally, I think France looks more like a pentagon
What's the big deal? Finding places with less humans is a passion of mine. Just getting away from the rat race and noise is good.
France steals 50 billion dollars a year from African countries.  Karma can't come soon enough...Murderous thieves.
an important note: With the dawn of tech workers being able to work from home, we may have a solution to these empty areas. As a tech worker myself from Portland, OR, it's feeling high time that I got the everliving hell away from the cities. Countryside is looking a lot more 'appetizing' now that I can A) afford to leave and B) am having to deal with the many problems living in a city comes with like higher prices, loudness, homeless people, crackheads, riots, crime, etc etc
A great nation like France needs 100 million people which it would have but for Louise XIV, Napoleon, the war of 1870, WW1 and WW2.  Of that 100 million at least 95 percent need to have undiluted French/Western culture and values.
The “vacant” parts are for farming.  You can’t raise wheat around apartment houses.
Centralization by by Paris is the French cancer as former realm was managed as federal provinces
Palestine is a country, always has been always will be. Embarrassing
"Empty void" ???  Are you putting us on? You really are putting us on, aren't you? This area is less populated because it is a rural area, but it's economic value is tremendous : some of this space has great agricultural value (haven't you ever heard of Champagne)? The bottom of the designed area is mainly mountains so this explains too, although it is wealthy in agricultural terms, as for the area closing the Mediterranean it has been wine country for centuries and now it still is remarkably increasing in quality with different "crus" (spots) that makes them challenge the older quality wine countries such as Bordeaux. Sio the space you outlined is thriving although less populated because the area is less populated. And by the way this area is not coherent : it encloses different cultures and different landscapes and ressources : the Ardennes are not Champagne, are not Massif Central not they are the Roussillon or the Basque country : in terms of culture, traditions, economic ressources, transportation and all other human and economic features. This is an artificial projection from geographers and statisticians who never visited those different places …  What is interesting are the previous comments from YTubers that clearly show they haven't grasped the situation except that you described a desert (which is not) : see for instance a comment comparing this place with Montana : ridiculous ! The man was totally mislead by your wrong assumptions. At any rate as many other previous comments show : sometimes demographics may not be the right scale to assess the quality and economic/financial value of a region. This is perfectly the case here. Back to the drawing board !…
I'm French and from the empty area! And proud! That's the real France 💪
I'm French and I wonder how you know all about this !
This video is kind of its own empty diagonal.  Information quantity per minute is low.  Not that the information is bad, just not densely presented.
this is wine country... they dont want any urban developpment there, land is not for sale and goes for a much higher price.
Take back Anerican Euopean descendants. We don't want them here!!!
Well you have at least subscriber from Lozère ! Growing up there is for sure unique with all that nature around. Going there fore holidays is absolutely great, but living there is a different story (long travel distances to get anywhere, little medical facilities…)
Truth is illegal nuclear testing of bombs. France destroyed the water on the planet Earth by poisoning it with radiation by illegally testing nuclear bombs underground and tinted all the water source of the planet Earth radiation. Do your homework do your research. France sucks
Jesus christ don't reveal it! They will come and ruin it
U Talk shit. Nothing is empty in this area over there man.
Is their a state of Palestine?
Why is the absence of human beings  presented as a problem?
there is a climate zone from Nevada to Canada that this reminds me of. it's crazy to think life in Pahrump Nevada could be similar to Osooyos Canada.
Correction the population density you said for England was actually for the UK. The population density for England is more like 440 people per square km
And what about Germany?
We need an empty diagonal in England too.... the dinghy divers should stay en France, they should love it there
France WAS a major power up until Macron started selling the country pieces by pieces to american pension founds, banks and his billionaire friends. Now, we're headed down the pipe.
Basically no Starbucks or McDonalds in the diagonal...got it....
Where is the state of Palestine located !?
That one area in which US doesn’t suck that much.
el hexagono mi huevo, xD. Madre mía.
France: Nooo! 1/3 of my country is empty!! Spain: Amateurs.
It’s right there in their flag. Three stripes of color. One of them is completely blank.
State off Palestine ?????
I live in that empty area.
What you have called palestina, is the state of Israel. Nothing to learn from you.
State of Palastine? Are we making up countries now?
When we hear french army they're just jokers they didn't win even single war Hitler crush them just like an aunt shame on them
The globalists want everyone to live in dense urban populations. Bill Gates is now the single largest owner of farm land in the US. The goal is to automate farming and herd us into city centers where we are easily surveilled and utterly dependent upon the government. Remember Klaus Schwab said it, "You will own nothing and be happy."
Il me semble avoir lu un jour que si la France avait eu la même trajectoire démographique que l'Angleterre, l'Allemagne ou l'Italie, elle compterait approximativement aujourd'hui une population de 120 millions d'habitants... et 90 millions de Français à l'extérieur !!!
C'est un peux comme le midwest aux USA ,des provinces méprisées par les élites de la côte Est .
C'est ce que l'on appelle chez nous en France : " la diagonale du vide ". C'est le résultat d'une politique de nos gouvernants depuis des dizaines d'années ,qui ont privilégié les banlieues des grandes villes islamisees au développement des territoires ruraux de la France historique .
So interesting thanks you
the most stupid meaningless analysis…. Lozere terrain won’t really allow higher population density with area like. causses that isolated…
France have 1/10 of his own territory as natural reserve for biodiversity, the south part in yout empty diagonal is a part of it (bear reinsertion for the Pyrenee mountains, a big park into Jura).  And the main reason for this empty part is because most of the economic activity for France is tourism and international commerce, which is why the population is in maritim cities.
There is no state of Palestine.
In 2:46 second you mentioned the state of Palestine. Is there really a state?
Toulouse empty ??
I am french, and although we love napoleon because he improved the condition of france by bringing the civil code and making reforms leading us towards a modern state, we must recognize that he has a rather bad record. He made us lose our territories in North America and he destroyed the young men of France on the European battlefields.  It was a real disaster, while England and Germany multiplied their population exponentially, France hardly increased its population from 1800 to 1900.  If we hadn't had all the deaths and had more children, we would now have 120 million inhabitants in France. Germany would never have attacked in 1940 a France more populated than itself. Germany began to be a danger when it united and France weakened.  If we had been more populated, the Catholic Latin domination would have continued to influence Europe (which is no longer the case because the domination is Nordic and Germanic today).
I think it's a false premise to claim that because the country has less populated areas, its global standing is at risk.  Where's the link here?  Borderline misinformation here.  Why don't the authors clearly identify themselves and what is their agenda?
'State of Palestine'? It hasn't existed since 1948 '4×less' a¼
sure looks like the "empty" area is the wine area.
So I live just at the border of that area then, I live in the departement of the Hautes Pyrénées touching the Spain border in the Région of the Midi-Pyrénées and from where I live beside Tarbes (a medium sized city) down south there is not much here especially if I go north there are just fields and forests.
France and UK THEY ARE 7⁰ and 6⁰ economy s power because they have 7milion s of people s most of the italy. ITALY  61 MILION S. ITALY IS 8⁰ POWER BUT  WITH POPOLACTION INFERIOR....TECNOLOGY  S ITALIAN S THEY ARE  SUPERIOR AT FRANCE . IN ITALY THE 30% OF ECONOMY IS IN THE INDUSTRYAL SECTOR,ONLY AFTER THE GERMANY  ,FRANCE 21%, ,UK  only  the 9% is economy INDUSTRIALE. .brexit is a true disaster for UK. Because UK economic suicide ?
sounds great to someone living in the nightmare of overcrowded England. I'm in the middle of the countryside yet am within one and a half hours of 18 million people, at least.
When taking a road trip from Germany to Paris, I was surprised by the endless distances of fields, just like being in Kansas. And then out of nowhere, Paris appears. In Germany, there is a town every 10-20 miles in many parts.
Fact check. There is NO state of Palestine!! There is a State of Israel 🇮🇱 resurrected from the Valley of Dry Bones by God.  😆
Isn't that good tho cuz we need more places with wildlife in the world right
All I see is room for green belts and planting trees.
From my own experience living in the poorer part of southern France, outrageous property taxes had to be paid directly to Paris.  If central government would tax people living in poorer parts less, I think people would stay and live there.
Aaaaaaaand. Here's my requisite reminder that it's STEAM. Not STEM.  Cuz no matter how many choose to live in denial? Art, will forever remain as important science, technology, engineering, and math.  Especially considering that most of those field's greatest accomplishments? Wouldn't be possible without the direct involvement of an artist.
I like how you randomly go from from speaking as if 40% of a population is a small proportion to speaking as if 40% is a large proportion, with absolutely no explanatory context for why your view shifted. for instance:  @1:10 'you'll cut the country roughly in half. and yet, 60% of the French live to the east of this line, while only 40% live to the west of it.'  a 60/40 distribution is 'cut roughly in half'. so I don't understand what point you think you're making here, particularly since you think it's been made clearly.  @7:13 'and while not every coastal area in France is highly populated, it makes sense that many of them would be. as 40% of the entire global human population lives within just 100km of a coastline.'  this means absolutely nothing without context. for instance, nearly 100% of people in the Carribean live within 100km of coastline, and that's also true of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, etc. and when you look at a map you should quickly notice that most of the land that's much further from the coast than that is desert of some sort. so I'm not convinced that you're successfully conveying anything here either, or that you really even understand what you're trying to say.
Jsjsjsjsj EMPTY??? jajajaj, whats empty is spain, Spain goes brrrr with empty yerm land
Really great video thanks for that but it’s a pity that you consider only metropolitan France as being the entirety of France. 2,7 millions of french people live in overseas regions and that is a thing that people often forget. But however the historical and analytical dimension of the video was great ! Keep going ^^
Part of France is only 30 people per square kilometre.  A Canadian: 😂🤣😂🤣🤓
easy enough the geography  ...
Where I live the population density is less than three people per sq km and still seems like too many people.  Makes me happy not to live in europe where 30 people per sq km (10 times where I live) is considered "empty".
In Australia we have a desert…

There is no such state as Palestine. You are a liar
hey sorry did i hear state of palestine? its country of "palestine"
In spite of what is stated at 0:12, India is about 6 times larger than continental France.
I love France 🇫🇷 and I want a job here, but I don't have fund.
I figured some cities might get hollow after all the Covid stuff. I live in the rural woodlands of South USA, and it was nice taking a piss and taking walks outside everyday when countless other people in cities all over the world were getting locked into their tiny apartments with varying degrees of government intrusion and brutality. It was like living in a cottage villa during a plague. And even before Covid, I missed all the election riots of the right and the left because of all the not-my-president bullshit on the right and left.
So... what is the problem with this distribution of population? The assumption that it is a problem is incorrect. Land is not a coloring book that needs to be filled in with people. In fact, the assumption that populations need to keep growing is completely incorrect. Uncontrolled invasive growth in our bodies is called cancer. (BTW related to this issue Elon Musk is an arrogant sociopath in midlife and is not a voice we should be following). Consider this and pass it on.
would have been a good spot to stick the war profiteering genocidal talmudists.
Lozère Department, the least populated in France, still has more people than Greenland (population: 57,000), which is as much as 1/4 the size of Europe as a whole.
Your French fetish is very weird. I’m also referring to your other videos about France. You are a weird American. 😬
So???
It's where I live and I love it for me, it's way better than living in an awful city like Paris. There is downsides obviously a country house can be really expensive and it's way harder to get a job despite of being less paid.
I live in that empty void 😅
My cousin has always lived in this "empy" space, that is mostly comprised of farmland. One way to feed the the rest of the country.
I live in that area: it's great!
Well my family is the oddity in what you said about family's moving to cities we moved away from them.
Be cautious when you say that they have to spread into the empty land...the diffusion of anthropogenic activity would negatively impact the biodiversity. It's better to have clustered cities that diffused ones
Palistine isn't a state or country. LOL
They should call it the foot, rather than the diagonal.
How about "why almost all of the USA are empty?"
enlightening - thanks
For the ignorant bigoted people,  you are already outnumbered.   While you still have the power, you need to learn how to live with others on an equal level or just disappear.
The diagonal is France’s agricultural back country.
The silly music adds only noise pollution.
You could just as easily say the same about Scotland north of Perth. So your argument doesn't really stand up. It's not the only European country with hardly anyone living in a part of it.
Lol it’s not a global “phenomenon” it’s Agenda 21. You think it’s really a coincidence….really?
I think this problem is really universal as you said. In Denmark the vast majority lives around Copenhagen and a strip of towns along the East Jutlandic fjords. Most other places see a decline in population, and the government has tried implementing various strategies to fix that, for example by decentralising the administration from Copenhagen now that modern electronic communications allow it.
problem of france is too  is to big centralisation like most of thing running in il de france and few main cities what you can count in fingers of oner hand

Where is this imaginary country Palestine you speak of?????
aww i technology hasn't made the spreading out of populations a thing. maybe if remote working, and movies being released by streaming, and maybe decent socialization via vr (no dance club nearby? just whip out a cartoon version of yourself :-D) no dating pool nearby? facetime-dating? maybe we'll need some kind of long distance grub hub drone delivery too.
The 1918 flu pandemic also substantially depopulated France, much more so in fact than all the World War I fighting. That pandemic, while horrific nearly worldwide, was especially devastating in France. This is not surprising since the heaviest fighting took place there for four years, with millions of men heavily packed into extremely unsanitary trenches, often in rain, mud, cold, and snow. The 1918 flu pandemic killed far more people than all the battles in World War I combined (up to 100 million flu deaths worldwide by some estimates).   Although called the Spanish flu because it was first reported in neutral Spain (which was not censoring its news of most mention of the flu), it killed far more people in France than in Spain. Both sides had to cancel major military operations in the spring and summer of 1918 because too many men were too ill to fight. That flu didn't become especially deadly in terms of loss of life until the second wave in September - November 1918. But the first wave, from March on was extremely contagious and could shut down entire cities, sickening up to a third of the people at a time. And with millions of men heavily packed together in trenches, many units had well over half their men on sick call for three days to two weeks at a time.    The Germans blamed the flu in no small part for the failure of their desperate spring 1918 offensive because speed was critical to it. Very simply, 100,000 Americans per month were pouring into France to train for the counter-offensive that would win the war before year's end. For sheer loss of life alone, the 1918 flu pandemic was arguably the most significant event of the 20th century. Yet strangely the "big history" industry, centered in colleges and universities worldwide, has almost totally ignored the 1918 pandemic for 100+ years.
Mmmm idk,  the middle of the US is pretty sparse on people as well.  But I believe like France and other countries,  a country needs less populated areas for its agricultural needs.  We have millions of acres solely for growing our produce, meats, textile, fuel and other necessities.  Besides,  those of us who live in smaller populated areas tend to enjoy it.  Young people may go off for educational or just to experience bigger cities.  But once they start families,  or age some, they will generally move back to the rural areas.  They start to appreciate what small town communities actually offer.
It should all be empty.
I lived for several years in a rural area of France in the southern part of the empty diagonal . Amazingly access to broadband internet was limited. The justification was that these areas were "so remote". But I pointed out that France is smaller than my home state of NSW in Australia, has more than ten times the population (and that is more evenly spread than in NSW), is an extremely rich country. The response: "bfffff".  I saw another recent news story on the lack of medical services in rural France due to demographic issues. There are plenty of well-trained doctors from the Francophony who are working in France but they get paid less than "native" doctors, in part due to off-the-wall racism across the country, and in particular in rural areas. I remember being in a "queue"for service at a Department government office. It didn't matter how long you'd been waiting, you'd get service in order of "whiteness" while the staff openly made disparaging comments about the non-white people a few metres away...
This is what I call "trivial conclusion": every country has areas that have a lower population density and areas that have a higher population density. It's also self-evident that most industrialized European countries will have a substantially higher population density in large urban centers. Furthermore, smaller countries like the UK will naturally have a much higher average density than larger countries like France. There's absolutely zero new information that has been shared in this video!
In America you can drive for a hundred miles and never see a house. There are vast sections of America where nobody lives. Something like 40 million acres are available through the Bureau of Land Management to anyone who wants to move there. We had a period of growth in the Industrial Age when Americans flocked to the cities for work. But that trend has reversed and people are moving to the country because they can work remotely from anywhere. So they don't need to put up with the hassles of living in a large metropolitan center to make a good living. 80% of Americans live to the East of the Mississippi while only 20% live out West. So 50% of the country has 20% of the population.
C’est magnafique la France
Also, mountains
Again, I really don't see this as any kind of problem.  There are numerous advantages to this - ecological, agricultural, heritage.    You really need to weigh your narrow economic vantage against other priorities.
I missed the part where it’s explained how this is a problem. It’s not an area I know much about, and maybe it’s more obvious to others, but I thought that the migration to cities was considered a positive thing. Fewer folks are needed for managing agriculture, and younger folks find themselves drawn to cities, so there doesn’t seem like there’s much of a demand for labor in the diagonal, so…. Less sprawl, more efficient services and less wasteful chain of consumption, seems all good to me. Less of a population in isolated, culturally homogenous zones that tend to breed xenophobia and other pathologies that grow from fear…. The opening thesis wasn’t even generally outlined for those of us who don’t know why the hysterical tone of the narrative was warranted. Maybe I missed it.
8:45 Joke about Eifel tower construction 200 hydraulic jacks with 200 bars pressure or 200*10^5 Blaise Pascals and 200 workers named Jacque (Jacque - Valet in English language King, Queen and Valet=Jacque that not just Agriculture lost 2 million peoples as unnecessary expandable force but Paris yellow vest also not lives in Paris district but in rural areas only rich investors form outside can afford Brazilin socialist's, Egypt close ties with dictators African dictators, Russian oligarchs.  Eifel tower was erected with less than 200 people.
I can't get why he always pronounce Belarus as Bel-a-rus. The -rus part is more of a -ruse.
je kif le 47 dépeuplé j'suis chez moi lol
7:40 - That includes Madrid.
Very interesting!
The Middle East and other Third World country’s still know how to make babies they’ll be just fine
Why is former east germany empty
"higher quality of life in this diagonal" well not really (I'm living in this "empty" spot) the public services are even worst than other places (french civil servant don't give a shit about their work because they can't get fired), more corruption, police don't give a shit about crimes, and much more pollution than in big cities (non isolated house + wood stove), no or poor jobs, shitty hospitals..
France is not the third most populous country in Europe, the UK is.
Pourtant... Que la montagne est belle... Comment, peut-on s'imaginer En voyant un vol d'hirondelles, que l'automne vient d'arriver ?
If you think that's sparse you should come to North Dakota.
Why 1/3rd of France is Almost Empty,.....because they've got a great business selling small boats in Calais.
Seems like a benefit tbh. New families could move there for cheaper housing etc while raising children, then those children move into urban areas for careers until they create families and move to the rural areas.
What about the fact that Germany has one of the world's worst demographics , almost as bad a Japan's,  and that the UK will be the most populous nation in Europe by 2045
The population distribution in France is a disaster. Once you leave lhe last suburb of Paris all you see is just vast empty fields with no life. So sad. Compare that with situation in Ireland where people live in their own houses locally 👍 🇮🇪
If I would be French, I would move to the beach area, it would be more fun living there :D. But you can deploy your migrants in these unpopulated areas xD. I'm curious what is an average French people mind, do you support those lot of black people in your country? I live in eastern Europe, but we don't need black migrants, we have our own problems with gypsies.
TL;DW: People live by the coast and in cities. Fewer people farm in the countryside.
I'm French and I don't see the problem about this kind of empty area, it's a nice thing for this piece of the earth !
Hello 👋,I also do historical content and you could follow to my account,then check it out😉.
And of course, this is not a problem.  In fact,  it's great that the countryside is not that dense.
Posh
I've lived in France.  It's not empty, it's all relative.  Since I live in SE Asia right now, Vietnam specifically, even populated parts of France would feel spacious to me now.  Let alone the American west or somewhere like that.
Please check your geography and correct: there is no "state of palestine" in the world. Please check professionally and correct truthfully.
If you made a video with a stock clip of the city of calgary in it I would literally give you money. I crave recognition. I need it

Palestine isn't a state
For South Korea, the country’s official name translates to the “Great [Korean] Republic.” But people have started to jokingly call the country the “Seoul Republic.” I don’t think I need to elaborate on why.
This is a problem why? Does France want their entire country to be one big city? Because that sounds dismal to me.
I believe in the pol pot solution
"Listen to me very carefully, i shall say this only once.   Rene did his best to keep up the birth rate of Paris during the war. That's why it's population is still booming."
Watching this made me realize that maybe the word Cities is due to people living closer to the Sea-ties
Stop calling Palestine a nation. Because it isn't. Islam has no place in the holy land
Belarus is pronounced; Byel-ah-rooce
The Arabs and Africans will be happy to fill the void.
Smooth Sponsorship
I'll save you 11 minutes of what could be said in one. There is a rural, sparsely populated diagonal region across France.
Frankly 30/km2 still sounds a bit crowded to me
This is very interesting, but the correct pronunciation of kilometer is *KIL-o-meter,* not (thanks to the French) kil-AH-meter. When expressing metric measurement, the emphasis is on the first syllable.
4:04 movie?
CLICKBAIT. Is 25% the population really almost zero? 5% is almost zero, 25% is low. This video is clickbait.
This is so dumb. Drawn out presentation that still manages to completely miss the main point.. just show a damn elevation map! Yeah, people live where it's convenient and accessible, shocker. So mostly coasts, major rivers, and then flat lands. The statistics around coastlines or about the general decline in population and the impact of wars are interesting but not directly on topic. Then we go on the topic of population migrating to urban areas, but still not mentioning why there are less urban areas there. Fucking mountains are barely mentioned, except the Alps that aren't in the outlined area, and only to branch on tourism.. As if that made the Alps a high population density area? Then the topic switches to agricultural land, but there is a lot of that in France, most of which is outside that diagonal. Honestly it's unbelievable to drone out for so long and still miss the point, the S-E half of France is mountainous, this central diagonal starts there and stops by curving around major river or the subterranean coast. So yeah, a diagonal of Mountains, or terrain suited for cattle but not flat enough for crops, lacking major rivers or coastlines. Honestly it's unbelievable, it's like making a long video about an odd large vertical line with low population density in the US and managing to not mention the rocky mountains even once. At some point you should hit the nail even by chance.
I know what you did there
One word...socialism.
Palestine? Take some geography lessons
Ok, excusme but expanding the diagonal through Spain and including the Basque Country and Madrid in it sounds to me like a fake, since those a 2 of the most populated places in Spain.
They exploit African nations in the most wicked ways
The Ottoman Empire (Turkey) was Europe's most populous country between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Hmm this should reverse soon, now that people can work from home new "fibre internet" towns will pop up for people to enjoy the country side views.
Actually ENGLAND has a population density more like 432 people per km2.
I’ve always been surprised at how urban people have a disdain for the countryside and the people in it. They look at shops and consumer junk sold there as the defining condition for success.
I didn't learn anything
People actually do BE living in cities? sounds about white
Nearly the same size as India?  Am i missing something and misunderstood this statement???
There is no state of Palestine unless you're an anti-semite or ignorant of even the most recent history
Cool vid, a bizarre topic... but interesting
France really is a beautiful country.... So as an Englishman, France with less French sounds great!         This is obviously sarcasm, for the brainlets who think I'm serious.
There are advantages to living in rural France, if you are retired. I gave up work and moved from London [5713 people per sq. kilometre] to The Gers [30 people per sq. kilometre] The air is cleaner, the roads are less congested and wine is 1.30€ a litre. Cheers !!!!!!!!!!
If  I would be a frog, now I would know where at best living in France.
Europeans are not having children. Especially Italy. Maybe they are simply delaying pregnancy due to finances?
Re the 60/40 split along the Le Havre/Marseille axis: if you leave out the Paris metropolitan area (11 million) the western side has more inhabitants.
In America we are leaving the cities and moving to the country.
I love these geography videos. Keep 'em coming, RLL.
0:05 Champs Elysees with Danish flag outside Maison du Danemark
So basically countries have varying population densities across regions and agricultural areas are less dense than urban ones? Hmm interesting
Geographers no longer call this space the empty diagonal but rather diagonal of low densities. However it's a really convenient and schematic representation wich is only partly true ggiven that there are several centralities in this territory such as Toulouse, Limoges, Reims or Clermont wich all have high level services and can be considered metropolises.
I got married in France. She was from Borg les Orgues. Beautiful place.  Awesome Blow Jobs.
Look at the démographique.rural and city living
Germans at 2:16- “Lebensraum?” 🙋🏼‍♂️🇫🇷
8:03 Fewer.
The major metropolitan areas of France such as Paris, Lyon, and so are constituted mostly The Frankish Empire. France even means "Land of The Franks, a Germanic tribe. Although the French cling to the Roman Latin, and Celtic influences very religiously, they've mostly forgotten how Germanic they are because of the various wars with Germany in the past, which isn't very politically correct to point out because of French nationalism. But, the French leadership hasn't entirely. During The Cold War, the French, and West Germans combined their industrial, and military might seemingly to counter the power, and influence of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. But, when you look at it from a larger perspective, they were each helping each other out due to them both having diminishing returns in industrial output. In the case of France, the empty interior. In the case of Germany, the communist occupied East Germany, which still is very depopulated, and less industrialized, and high in unemployment today.
9:15 Wow. People actually do be living in cities.
Those are beginner numbers. Sincerely, Sweden
You speak of our world as a planet , or globe. Therefore I dont believe a word you say.
plz add  Chinese sub
Painting countries blue is certainly not a wise choice.
State of Palestine? Five million? No credibility here.
Irritating commentary: keeps saying 'less' instead of 'fewer' and uses tautologies such as 'plummet down'.
Now I know where Captain Picard's relatives lived and why some were antagonistic to him joining Starfleet.
Shocked that parts of the area of Aquitaine are sparsely populated (home of Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine queen of France and England at different points) because of home perfect the weather is and the great growing conditions would could be why its so populated, it's inhabited mostly by farmers/agriculture.
As a guy from Nigeria, where you could drive for hours in the North and only see like 5 people, I can tell you ....most countries are way more empty than they seem
When, in the video, the diagonal is extended into Sapin, it includes the two most populated areas in Spain, Basque Country and Madrid. So this diagonal is not so accurate.
Gee, the agricultural lands in the middle of a country, away from the coasts have low population density? Where have we seen that before?
Please consider captioning your video.  The background music makes it very hard to understand your speech, and captions would make it possible for more people to enjoy what looks to me like a very interesting topic.  Thanks!
Real question is why 2/3 parts of France are populated
Actually, the most populous country in all european history is germany. But for most of that history, it was deeply fragmented into 300+ little states.
State of "pallywood"?
Why is it taking so long to compare the population densities of other countries? It's like the first third of this video is empty space
Nearly identical in size to India? Damn you're delusional
In the US State of Georgia, one sees the same demographic.   Most of the state's population is in Atlanta with the Coastal Area being a distant second.  The mountains counties support a large population of retirees and have a thriving tourist industry catering to day trippers from the Atlanta metro.  Huge areas of the state that used to be filled with thriving agricultural communities are now sparsely populated and filled with tree farms and near ghost towns.
Why does the video say that France is almost the same size as India at 0:11? India is 2.5 million square kilmoeters bigger than France, six times the size! Am I misunderstanding?
There's too many French people there.
Should we talk about how the migrants during Obama's reign have gone into countries and depopulated???
There are reasons for this pattern of density, which you are not actually presenting. You are merely listing figures. You could do something similar about Switzerland. And then look at the Alps, also not very dense...Moreover, this colonialist, expansionist view of populations is absolutely shameful.
What's strange here? Doesn't every country has it's own flyover territory? And saying that "only" 40% of people live in the west made me confused. That split is pretty balanced compared to just about every other country.
Lost you when you compared to Palestine. No such country. You take political sides
Everything had been going great, until some evil bastards decided to kill the king and millions of people, demolish the country, destroy the Church and rull out God. Now they're paying and soon they'll swap their atheism for islamic slavery. Poor France... Are you going to reverse it? Instead of allowing for demolishing medieval churches and building mosques, start with making the Notre Dame a proper, Catholic church again.
Let's correct something: low birth rate is A GOOD THING. ok thanks.
If you haven't been to France. GO. NOW. It's stunning.  This video does no justice to it.
Weird. It's almost like they don't just want to procreate and fill in the space around them because of quality of life. What a crazy idea!
I can't see why this podcast is newsworthy.
...BLABLA...BLABLA...BLABLA...Vive la France...😵😴
what is the song starting at 3:22 ? :)
this is like the USA where the center of the country is almost empty.
This was already the situation during the French Revolution, which the committee has realized. People were speaking patois, literacy, healthcare, infrastructure were nonexistent. The first task was to drain the swamps and build roads, because even traveling into the region was impossible. Then revolutionary educators were sent out to teach the population French, but the situation hardly improved even during World War I. The first thing the army had to do with new recruits was to teach them basic French so they would understand the commands at least. Education was so backward that in the 19th century a typical peasant remedy against childbirth fever was to drink wine mixed with wax from a church candle. But the biggest problem remaining was language. It was nigh impossible to make the people speak and read passable French.
I'm in an area that is less populated. When I go fishing I usually have the place to myself and I get fish. I go to the store 2 min drive shop for 5 min 2 min Drive home. Parking is a problem at peak but you go there first or last you are in and out. In fact I rarely am more than 3 cars deep at any traffic control device.
You failed to mention how many wealthy British people have populated that linear bulge in the French countryside.   Moreover, how do you account for the sparsely populated, southerly-protruding aneurysm of the linear area that is proximal to the southern coast, stretching between Marseille to the East and Spain to the West?
What a waste of 11 minutes of my life.  No real insight here...basically it's rural so it has less population.
too much wee wee
becuase hexagons..are the bestagons
For when tjeir nuclear power plants melt down
So basically an 11 minute video telling everyone “ain’t shit there that’s why it’s empty” lol
I grew up in haute loire, a departement above lozère. It's a beautiful place, but a little bit cold. It is high (i lived in 800+ above the sea). I think there is an other thing to explain "la diagonale du vide". In the middle of france there is "massif central", a bunch of old vocanos ( no eruptions since 1 millions years, extinct). This doesn't help people live there. The biggest city in massif central is Clermont-ferrand, which is in a lower place, surounded by volcanos. There is a beautiful city in haute loire, "le puy-en-velay". There is a renaissance festival in the old part of the city. The streets are narrow and paved with cobblestone, with people dressed in 16th century fashion. It is called "Fête du roi de l'oiseau".
The overall lenght of the french coastline is impressive, what a gift.
Entire Portugal has less inhabitants than the city of São Paulo.
I would absolutely love to live there.  People in my area are trending to moving away from cities and out into the country!
Since many people live near coasts then why doesn't France make a HUUUUUUUGE river in the diagonal to attract more people? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Because it's France. Who the fuck really wants to live there.
Cities give me the creepy crawlies
What percentage of the low population areas in France are expat Brits getting away from overcrowded UK?
0:49 I've never heard that.
Great videos.
that is spain’s lazer
Because they sailed over here in rubber boats
I thought at first this would be about the area France has fenced off due to all the unexploded artillery shells from WW1.
Palestine is not a state.  30% of Israel's citizen's are Arab.  Palestinans are Arabs. They chose to have citizenship in a functioning democracy where they can move freely and receive the same welfare payments as Jewish citizens, unlike Israelis in the Palestinian administered territories.
So not empty then.
MountaIns is my guess without wathing this.
L'hexagonedaaaaa
So urbanization. K.
Oh boy maybe you can make a video why the "State of Palesine" is real. I wonder what advertisers you're pandering to at the expense of reality. Your credibility took a hit there.  So weird that I can easily drive in and out of this supposed "state" without even as much as a road sign, to say nothing of a border crossing. Also so weird that this supposed "state" uses the currency of another state instead of its own.
Your pronunciation is terrible.
Seems too much like "equity" bullshit being stupidly applied to geography.  The low rates of childbirth in western countries is an issue, but this video approaches the topic from the wrong perspective imo.
The keys is the cost of transportation of goods.  Shipping is the cheapest, so you get ocean side cities and navigable river cities.  2nd is Rail Road transportation, so where railroads were built is the second tier of cities.  3rd is high speed limited access roads, often built near the railroads.  Against all of these is steep terrain that limit cheap transportation.
Misleading - search "zone rouge" instead
THE NARRATOR'S ENGLISH IS NOT GOOD. E.G. FEWER, NOT LESS.  HIS KNOWLEDGE OF GEOGRAPHY IS BAD. WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS "PALESTINE"?
cool
This is why many Dutch, Belgian and British have second homes there....
dominance not over the great Britain get it right
probably arent any no go zones there, or cars on fire. its safe to walk the streets, and arent gangs of young men hanging around outside the schools. it sounds great
'Woah, a 1/3 of France is empty? That's crazy!' Australia: Hold my beer.
We bought a beautiful old house in the Creuse ,it is very quite and peaceful and a well kept secret as its rural france its perfect as most young want to live inthe city's not the country
Terrain Terrain Terrain
.....what are you suggesting...bulldozing and paving all the vineyards in that area?! Wine is one (If not the best)products they produce!!
2nd largest military in Europe ,and 5th largest economy in the west. France is most important to the west.  You are silly.
This pattern is even more pronounced in the U.S.  It explains little, and certainly not "declining influence".
Is Palestine a state? Even the Palestinians themselves didn't declare themselves as a state for their own reasons.
It's the same in most countries.  Especially the US.
Maybe if the  government didn't  tax the hell out of the people.they would have more kids...
Why not bring in ukrainians farmer family refugees to work these agricultural lands in france spain portugal.
What a stupid and uninformed video.
Can't stop the blue blob (this only makes sense of you played a CK game)
Pas un mot sur le Massif Central 🤦 C'était pourtant le point principal
Fake news
Hang on. So 60% of the worlds population lives further than 100km away from oceans/seas?! That seems stupido given all the universal truths listed in the video? Please explain why humans are dumb like this
WHAT are you talking about there is NOT  a nation called " Palestine " there are palestinians and Israel
France's flyover country looks like a foot.
what is the income/wealth factor of this relative empty quarter ?
No doubt Ukrainian refugees will move in.
But were are all frogs living are they consumed?
We need open spaces so we can breath, run and ScrEAm.....!! 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♀️🤣🤩
Jeez, people are living sparse in the areas there are no conditions for living in high density. Send billions $ to that area like world does with so called palestina and you see population to grow. It is a farm country there, living is hard, millenials are not ready to work hard, they like to steal from others via taxes.
first mistake 2:50 refers to palestine as a state this is false.
Do a video on why the UN is a toothless bulldog. I was asked that question once in school and I scored poorly.
Fascinating!
I think that it's nice for France to have this large "undeveloped" area because it gives the nation a peaceful place to get away from the chaos of the cities. Otherwise, the whole of France would be the same monotonous urban environment with hardly any remains of natural experience to enjoy.
What is the point of this production? Much of the central part of France is made up of rugged terrain unsuitable for mass habitation and much of the rest is agricultural and so equally unsuited. There are plenty of urban areas elsewhere so what's the issue? Much of the centre of the United states is relatively uninhabited,much of it made up of windblown grassland suffering extreme weather and suitable only for energy intensive agriculture or harsh desert which can only be settled by even more energy intensive and ultimately unsustainable means, Las Vegas being the prime example.
Totally Useless, look at US and see why East/West coast vs central US, or Eastern China vs central or western China, people move to a location because of a reason. Regardless if it is hurricane prone (Florida, or the Gulf Coast) or earthquake prone, e.g. California, Hawaii or the whole west coast that is susceptible to the fault line.  Look, Europe as a whole, have been populated for a long time, maybe there is a reason that people don't live there? Maybe like northern Norway, or Sweden or Finland??
Well time to move to lozere
The State of Palestine?????????????? When was it founded and officially recognized? Please provide a map of the so called recognized borders. Who is counted in the 5 million?
4X less people - you must have meant 75% fewer people because 1X less people would mean zero people (so 4X less people makes no sense)
Take a minute and go look at a map showing all the Islamic areas that Muslims have turned into “NO-GO” Zones for none Muslims. It is truly shocking. “France is a Muslim country," according French Ambassador to Sweden Etienne de Gonneville. Currently, demographically France is actually 47% Christian and only 5% Muslim. But it’s likely that the ambassador was referring to the fact that while they are only 5% of the population, the Muslims who have immigrated to France have no intention of assimilating. They are unapologetically intolerant, bigoted, and antisemitic (as their faith instructs them to be) and under their constant threat of more violence, they have forced French Jews to have to flee their homeland. Shameful. Muslim men also kick French women out of public spaces in France. So for all intents and purposes, if the non-Muslims are living on egg shells, I suppose it’s a Muslim country. Or maybe Etienne de Gonneville was engaging in anticipatory grieving, since the low birth rate among nonMuslim women and large birth rate among Muslim women will truly turn France into a Muslim nation within a few generations. Either way, over the next 20-60 years world can say goodbye to French wine and the beautiful French cathedrals. So sad what globalist leaders and stupid Woke ideology has done to the world.
So basically trickle down economics doesnt work for the low socio economic areas which governments have to support , never the Billionaires or Oligarchs
"...which is why it's so surprising that nearly a third of the country, here, is basically just an empty void, and partially because of that France has been diminishing in influence for centuries and continues to do so."  Did the British Empire fall because of the underpopulation of Northern England and the Scottish Borders?  One expects to meet goofy theories on Youtube, and I wasn't disappointed by this.  The author spent some time in the video supporting the thesis that declining population has contributed to France's relative decline, but nothing about how "le diagonale du vide" plays a role in that decline.  Virtually every holiday I take in France includes time in the glorious countryside of Auvergne, Berry, Burgundy and Lorraine, and I revel in how few of my fellow Americans, or anybody else for that matter, I find there.  Vive la difference!
Even the least inhabited areas of France are way overpopulated. I would rather live in an area with a density of less than 1 person per square mile.
So many of these useless people need to migrate back to the countryside... you know so they can grow their own food.
The state of Palestine...Do you mean all of Israel or the parts controlled by The Palestinian Authority?
The most rural places I think are most appealing!
Keep Manhattan  just give me that  countryside.
France looks like pigs head to me.
People in or outside of France may see this part of France as a laughable anomaly and wasted potential; but to tell the truth as an average west/central European inhabitant it is just a pleasure to visit this region that is mostly devoid of humans and urbanisation. I hope it stays like it is to be all honest
Palestine isn't a State.
You mean Israel?
The French population turned away fro Faith in GOD after the so called Age of “Enlightenment”
It looks like you identified the agricultural regions of France and called them empty.
didn't quite make it through the whole video.  11 minutes to explain something that could be done in one paragraph.
Would remote work keep some people stay in the country side?
Check out the position of Chongqing China.
Switzerland and Liechtenstein are doing rather well.
The absence of coast line is a very dubious argument. Check out the coast line of neighbouring Germany!
I don't like my neighbors, but I do like long lunch breaks, so I think living in the diagonal would be nice.
Poland next, same topic
My ancestors came from France.  I was there once.  Want to go again to see more.  ❤
State of palistine?   Give it a break, there is no such place.
In Canada, french women used to have 20 children families...and most moved to America. So now, half of Americans have a french origin name for this reason! Still, most of east Canada speak french!(north Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick)
The demographics of France have nothing to do with this diagonal of density but they are fascinating. The number of people killed in Revolution and WW1 was great but it was not what made them go down, China lost 60 million people in the 40th 50th yet its  population tripled. The important is what made these man (mostly farmers) when they went back. They had learnt by the prostitutes in the army how to avoid having a kid. However if they made children they would have to divide their fields between their successors (it was encouraged after Revolution) and make them ridiculously small. They would also risk to see them go to another bloody war. So most of them used contraception to have only one child to give their land.  There were other factors but just to compare : Germany (1870 territory) in 1800 was ~ 20M and France ~ 30M  Germany in 1940 was ~ 70M (with a huge community in America and others)  and France ~ 40M (with very little emigration)
Rural France is beautiful.
can you not color land blue just like the sea? Together with fancy rotating map it takes a minute to figure out whats water whats land.... common sense man
You could have mentioned all the citizens France has run off. Start with the 200,000 Huguenots who fled mostly to England, Scotland, Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland and even Russia. Composed mainly of merchants, tradesmen and military personnel and some members of the nobility they were welcomed everywhere. They brought rice planting to the US in South Carolina, metal work to GB, The US and Russia. Think of Faberge and our own Paul Revere (Rivoire)  Along with those they brought textile weaving, Leather tanning, shoes and gloves, Hats and dress making. The Duponts brought chemical manufacturing including explosives. They tried to raise silkworms but it didn't work out for some reason. Us presidents Washington and Roosevelt were Huguenot descendants.
One correction (among several mispronouciations) you compared the empty region size to the "state" of "Palestine". "Palestine" is not a "state" and never has been even during the centuries of Islamic control, or more modern European control. "Palestine" is merely a region that a specific group of people have been generously given by the State of Israel (which IS a legitimately recognized State).
A few years ago, we were in Berlin for a week. We noticed that the Polish border was only 100km away, so we decided to drive into Poland for the day. We crossed the border at Frankfurt on the Oder, and thought about stopping at the first town for lunch. We drove on, but the country was just empty. Endless fields and forests  and only a few small villages where some of the houses looked abandoned. No shops, just the odd petrol station. Clearly, the young people had gone west for better opportunities. A shame, because Poland has a lot of potential for economic growth.
Les yeux sans visage
Yeah,  probably all farmland.
I visited France a couple times in 1975 while on leave from West Germany. Everywhere I visited was beautiful and every single French person I met was nice to me.
Have an idea to significantly repopulate these areas along with Spain. Just repopulate with Moroccans, Afghans, Algerians, Sudanese, Sri Lankan aaaaand  voila >> Instant repopulation fix ! Soooooh, what the issue ? In fact, in 30-50 years, cud be facing overpopulation !
The economist Jane Jacobs wrote about this phenomenon (and not just about France) in her 1970 book _The Economy of Cities_ .
So? Ever see the middle of the USA?
Nearly identical in size to India? Think you've been eating the wrong type of champignons!
Plebs: Palestine  consuls: Israel
"The state of Palestine". Does not exist, nor has it ever. You meant the Country of Israel and 10 million.
I moved to village in France called Loudun. The people in that area  have a lot of inbreeding. A lot have never left the villages. The young move away leaving nasty old people. They lie viciuos gossip and stare at any one with a demonic look of hate. Calling women prostitutes or witchs. It was truly frightening.  Obviously I moved away to the Loire valley which is lovely with normal people.
India is nearly 6x the size of France and the diagonal has mountains.   The rest of it is interesting though
Not much compared to Australia
French military. 😉
wtf ? South west is not empty at all
It's funny, here in Australia I think of the state of Victoria as being quite densely populated - it has about 25 people per square kilometre.
It was the Camisard war.
Nobody: This guy: twho hundred thrity tw    hhhhhoo Guarant   hhheed One Hhhhhhundred
In short: contraception, war, and industry - the same story is repeated in Germany, Russia, the USA, etc (human babies are, after all, a socially unwelcome and expensive habit). Well, I guess the decline helps to make room for some population-boom migration .. if only in theory (for very few modern migrants go further than the urban ghettos). Note well: Ancient Rome suffered from prolonged periods of massive rural decline in population, activity, and cultivation (occasionally refilled, if only briefly, by population shifts aka the critical phenomenon of plantation, migration and invasion) .. Just saying. ;o)
"State of Palestine" umm where exactly is that? 5 million people? Oh no, definitely not. Most of what you say it "real life" but the part about "palestine" is simply a fish tale.
Can you do why 1/3rd of Spain is empty
thank you for acknowledging Palestine!!
40% is not "only 40%". Chump.
Le Code civil  (21 mars 1804) " Code Napoléon" supprime le droit d'aînesse. Les paysans (qui forment la plus grande partie de la population) doivent partager leurs champs ils feront moins d'enfants The Civil Code (March 21, 1804) "Napoleonic Code" suppresses the right of primogeniture. The peasants (who form the largest part of the population) must share their fields they will have fewer children
I'm in West Virginia man would I like to trade places
Demographics are indeed destiny.  It's why America has gone in to the dumpster over the last 50 years with 3rd world immigration.
So much for over population making Europe unsustainable.
I did not know the population density in France is so low. From you this vedio I come to know about  population density and demography of France.
A small edit: There is no State of Palestine
What a pile of crap. France fought with the Nazis against the USSR in WWII and was rewarded with the Marshall Fund and a seat on the UN Security Council.
France has a strange socialist government, nice place, bad politics
there is no such a "country" or people by the name of Palestine, what was there flag 100 years ago? or the leader?
Oh as a child I grew up in a very small village and I have such happy memories! However, later in life my husband and I used to live in the middle of nowhere,- and in my 20s-30s I really felt bad about my life, it is like… there is no difference, are you alive or not anymore, nothing happens in your life today, nothing will happen in it in the future… Our government even closed our tiny educational “college” It should be diffeeent
So what is causing the low birth rate?
Spoiler alert: not empty. Goodness. We really do desperately need places devoid of humans. But there are hardly any places left on the planet like that except the extremes. Europe is extremely overpopulated.
3:59 - Polish infantry?
Interesting? why would this be interesting in the slightest and what the hell does it have to do with anything? Wow! humans gather in areas, AMAZING HUH? NO, it isn't interesting to anyone with the slightest hint of common sense, what is sort of interesting and depressing is that the general populous are now incapable of consideration, incapable of thought that they desperately look to others to try and see what they should find interesting, they have KFI that this supposedly interesting fact is actually so stupidly simplistic that it makes me angry that I waited, watching till the end of this video that was total crap, just to find that it was made by someone who would be equally interested in reading out the numbers of Pi and dribbling on him self.
make the same with Russia please
Decreasing fertility rates (enlightenment, overthrow of church).
Oh is farm land. Who would've of ever thought rural areas would be less densely populated? I thought food just appeared in the grocery store, like magic.
"Paris, pour une messe?  Mais bien sur! " Sure, that guy was totally French!  The nations of Europe are mainly city states that took over by force.
Same as New York. Half the population lives in NY City alone. Many in Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Albany. Rest of state is endless mountains, forests and farm land.
Pfft... that's nothing. You want to see empty come to Australias outback. I drove off-road for five days last July without see another human.
This is the same for almost every country
In America, that is called "fly-over states".
69 likes… nice…
How to fix it? Introduce Universal income. BOOM! Suddenly people don't need to go where they survive and stay put at the countryside where they like it more. but that would take money out of politicians pockets
Palestine is not a state
Soo…do the same analysis in Australia. It’s not 1/3 of the country that’s emptying out, it’s most of if. In Japan people move to just one metro area and hollow out the rest of the country. You were disingenuous when using England in your comparison, the sovereign nation is the United Kingdom. I’m sure you can find depopulated areas there too. Kennith Branagh just won a Oscar for the story of his internal migration for instance.
i think plastien is a country not a stat
IF it was bigger, you would call it "fly-over" country. Nothing unique about this.
I hate to say it but that is hardly "almost empty"
please France watch out for China. you may be fixing to get sucker-punched agene. first was Hitler
arf, talking about population density, taking germany and uk to reference , well , for belgium it is (according with wikipedia) 375 hab/km2 , sooo yeah the 270 hab/km2 of uk seems relative...
Pretty potent area for sure!
I have a French rifle from WWll, it's in pretty good shape, it's only been dropped once
In thé 1960s, the french actually abducted more than 200 algerian kids to try and fix the issue in Creuse département
France's main problem is that the country isn't making enough babies and instead, imports its (moose limb) babies, who will grow up and make 5 - 10X more (moose limb) babies.  Several people have written excellent books about the demographic decline and doom of the West.  France is bad; Italy is worse.
The part of the map of France in the thumbnail that is colored red, includes 2 largish cities: Toulouse and Clermont-Ferrand.
When you said that the least populated department had “barely” 76k people i was shocked, but because of how many people live in the LEAST populated region. Like that’s a lot for those of us who live in south america. Entire parts of our countries the size of whole European countries have way less people than that.  Im from Argentina, and for instance, there’s a department called Lihuel Calel, that’s 12,460 sq kilometer and has a population of 439 people.
The only people that like the French, are the French
The video also reminded me that France gave us the metric system....a curse on us all.  Maybe the videos could have separate USA and "world' soundtracks.
India has the third economy of the world
I’ve lived in West Virginia and this makes sense,  but it’s more like living with people and animals
No one ever: This channel: People call France the hexagon. 😂  It doesn't even look like a hexagon as you can clearly see in the video.
There is no such state as Palestine. You ruin your credibility by playing pc games .
England has a population density of 430 per km squared. The UK has a population density of 280 so you probably mean that. If you’re doing geography videos you should learn the difference between England and the UK.
France also owns ALOT of land in Africa. The imperialist age should be over already.
France is "solving" their problem by importing the black cancer.
Who cares
No 'empty void' in the US? BTW: Voids are always empty. But very interesting. And in the USA the Voids can overpower the areas of high concentrations. People in the empty void have the same number of senators as people in densely populated areas. So the Senate represents voids more than it does represent the densely populated areas.
ew fr*nce
"Empty" region of France =  30 persons per square kilometer Wyoming = 2.3 persons per square kilometer.
You meant the West Bank ... The map of t State of Palestine includes Israeli occupied land especially the coast on the Mediterranean.
I live in that less populated area of France and I hope it stays that way, The less people the better these days.:-)
more like a pentagon, really
I live in Iowa and we have the same problems for similar reasons. Plus in rural Iowa if you don't get married before you are thirty. It is hard to get married because all the good one are taken and what you are left with is the wall flowers. This is a problem you didn't mention in your show. I am 58 I tried to get married repeatedly(engaged 3 times) and I am still not married.
The point for me is not that these areas of France and Spain are less populated, but that they have lost and are losing their population, due essentially to processes begun by the Industrial Revolution, which has lead inevitably to globalisation of production, and increasing urbanisation, all powered by cheap energy from fossil fuels. If you believe it is still possible for human civilisation to survive climate change, then you have to urgently reconstruct rural culture and production, promoting local economies powered by renewable energy. Unfortunately, such economies, based (as everything ultimately is) on agriculture, will probably not be viable in a world where there are no predictable weather patterns.
Look into the sparsely populated regions of Spain, you'd be surprised. The celtiberian range is called the "Spanish lapland" as it has a similar population density as the nordic lapland.
There is no state called Palestine. By making this political statement, that is factually false, you lose your reliability  as an educational channel, let alone the fact that you side with an antisemitic entity, the only one in the world that has laws that ban Jews from buying land there, and that enforcing those laws with death penalty to whomever caught selling land to a Jew. Plus, the are no 5 million Arab residents in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza strip. More like half that number.  I know. I live there.
Y’all just lost credibility with your using ideology to inform your dialogue. There is no “state” of Palestine. There are Arab Autonomous Areas of the state of Israel called the “Palestinian Authority”, per agreements in International law called the “Oslo Accords”. Do attempt to strive for accuracy of you intend to be anything other than an Arab Nationalist/Islamist Supremacist propaganda/misinformation spout.
the emptiness can be filled by refugees
Idk as an American I'd hate to think my nation has no country side. This sounds like a good thing
The state of Palistine?
The North Korea of France just like West Virginia is the North Korea of the US
I would never want to move back to living in a city.
The population density of the whole USA is about the same as this "diagonal", just 33.6 per km2.  So what?    You could make a similar case for Scotland which has an overall population density of 67.5 per km2, but 80% of Scotland's 5.5 million population are packed into the highly urbanised Central Belt, and most of the rest are up the East coast between Fife and Aberdeen.  In the 1960s the Central Belt was said to be the most densely urbanised area in Europe.  I don't know if that's still true, but if not it can't be far off.  Yet most of Scotland's land area is empty, at least in the sense you use the word here.  Again, so what?  There are geographic  and historic reasons for uneven population density in any country.
correction.  There is not nor has there ever been a State of Palestine.   There I fixed it for you.
Yes there is an answer, simple.  Repopulate it with the DISPLACED INTERNATIONAL MASSES.  Prime example:  Those form the Current War in Ukrane.  Lempa Philly USA
It's the same in every country, there are the main cities that are full of people , then there's the outskirts of cities that are no longer urban but the sub- urban areas , then there is the country ,..the areas where farming , vineyards , mountainous areas with villages , small towns etc ..areas too far from what in US  call Downtown..of every main city .   while Europeans see as the province anything outside the most populated areas . It's  variety of lifestyle , a country that has variety of choices in living style environmentally and socially  is a healthy country .  That is the way it should always be , people need to be able to have choices .just my opinion.
This is... interesting. But, this is pretty standard for a lot of nations. I can show you a part of the USA that's basically empty that's literally 1/3rd of the nations and cuts it in half.  Germany has the samet hing going on, a 1/4th seciont of the nation is basically empty.
And yet they want Elsaß-Lothringen
Well it’s empty because they send all their immigrants over to the UK..
So you're saying it's the best place to live?
There is not state of Palestine
In France, more people live above the equator than below it, currently.
In France, more people own automobiles than own hospitals.
I'd rather live in a boot than a hexagon :-)
China has something like 80% of its people on something like 40% of land to the east of the country . The Central US states are sparsely populated. The weird one is Canada, where most of the population hugs the US border and not near the coast
In France, more people live in cities than live on farms.
It seems like most countries that are relatively large have a sparsely populated section of it for one reason or another
There is no state of Palestine
Not discussed? The fact that if all borders were closed, France could support itself due to these areas growing enough for the rest of the country. I live in Burgundy where the Charolais beef is loved throughout France and in fact across Europe. How does the song go? 'They paved paradise, put up a parking lot'!
Recently the "diagonale du vide", has become much more attractive. There's a move from cities to rural areas and this is the most affordable part.
Isn't Paris the largest Muslim city in Europe?
They left this space for German or Russian tanks, so Spaniards look out...😜
Why was this video 11 minutes long? This story should have taken 3
I lived in this empty diagonal in my childhood. I will forever be grateful because of how peaceful and quiet it mostly was. (Yeah, we still had crimes, but far less than in densed areas) Good area to raise a child and retiring peacefully. Especially if you live in small villages.
You forgot geography.. As in, that there's a lot of mountains in that corridor. Can't believe how you could possibly miss that!? I was like sitting here waiting for you to bring it up next. And then next. and then next.. And then the vid ended..😞😞
What is with the metrics system not everybody is from Europe there are people who live in the USA which we do not operate off metrics system you can use both but not just one. Please don’t be so naïve that you think everybody operates off of their system thank you
Not strange at all. Coastal lands, and places near, are where populations are usually denser. For example, in the US California and the East Coast are densely populated, while the middle of the country is quite empty.
Your graphics appear to be a selective bias. You need to work on how you relay information to the viewer. If I was to critic your video based purely on how you displayed your information, I would question your "extension" of the diagonal into Spain and oust your idea of the diagonal in France beginning and ending in a landlock. Very disappointed with this video. It feels as though this is has been made to cater to the audience, without cadence to it's validity.
There is no state of Palestine.....it is fiction
Identical in size to India?!  Not even close!  India = 1.2 MILLION square miles.  France = 210,000 square miles.  How exactly is that "nearly identical".
Ok.. so France has open spaces and breathing room? And? Lol how much open space does Canada have?
South Korean government constantly puts pressure on their populace to move to urban areas.
Sorry you lost me when you mentioned the “state” of Palestine.
Room for 40million Ukrainians then ! Unlike the UK which is bursting at the seams !!
Almost every country is grappling with low birth rates. fewer world wars would help! A shrinking population diminishes overall production and gdp.  The population “gaps”in Spain and France reflect the emptying out of regions.
You didn't mention WW1 and 2 leaving tons of toxic materials and unexploded bombs in that strip.
france is a country that was originally set up by the vatican
someone once said that even jesus christ wold have a tough time ruling france. when the french people go on strike the entire country goes on strike. do not tell the average frenchie what they can or cannot do. they will go on strike.
I hope a lot of people gets inspired, move there and start natural/organic farming, food forests and bring some much needed life back to the valleys. These more modern mono farming methods are so damaging.
No country is evenly populated and It would be even more Strange if France was equally populated - rediculous video
I see a time comming when people will go backk to the country side. Just look at the housing market. If you want a house / land, you *have* to move out of the city.
Yet, the less populated spaces are a more ideal to live in.
An 11 minuite ad for brilliant...
Cities suck. Country living is soooo much nicer.
france only had a huge population because the inhabitants of the colonies were counted as french...
This video makes no sense. Every country has low density areas, wait until you see Canada, Australia, damn even China
Throw china out from UNO. China should be punished by 4o trillion dollar as compensation for victims of virus.
Downwind of Paris.  Ever sit next to a French dude on the plane?  Imagine a million of them.
People who think optimal living is Urban are always the first to die in war and to starve in famine. Have at it
Is this ag land?  Regions like this are NECESSARY.
"BS"
The whole country of the France was smaller than State of Texas
France should put all of its economic refugees there.
I just keep seeing a giant foot that goes all the way across France, kicking north and west.
I thought the twist was going to be thousands of unexploded mines and bombs from the wars.  😆
You left out that a lot of that region are national parks.
People live there lier I could cut out a strange shape of any country and come up with this.
Wrong facts : France is about 16 percent of India Not identical to size of india
Basically after losing WW 1&2 and needing to be rescued all the women left the cowardly country of France for real men elsewhere in the European continent.
It's the nation of Israel,  not palestine.
Bla bla bla!
to put this in perspective.  If i go east i get into mountains and the population is scattered and if you aren't following a road you are more likely to find a bear then a person hiking.   If i go north... the odds of finding people drop to lottery level.  And ya the area to the north is bigger then this empty space in france.  It's seriously absolutely nothing but bush for like 2000 miles.
Also property tax
The biggest point. As farms because mechanicalized and automated, the countryside did not need such a big population....
1/3rd of the South of France is Occitanie
The "empty diagonal" translation is a bit imprecise. It is "la diagonale du vide", not "la diagonale vide". A more accurate translation would be "the diagonal of emptyness", which is allegedly much more badass xD
State of Palestine?
Maybe their fries suck
Same thing applies even more so to entire regions of Italy and Spain, with entire regions very sparsely populated due to many decades of emigration. Since neither Nation is reproducing, the bastards that control Europe are trying to remedy this situation by replacement with inferior races from Africa. This of course will result in the complete and utter destruction of these nations racially and culturally. White people need to rebel against this forced integration. Racism is GOOD. F the left.
Not just coasts. Rivers also, especially navigable ones. That is the reason the empty zone is a stripe instead of covering all of the landlocked part of France.  The border to Switzerland is certainly not a coast, but it is not empty, because there is the Rhone river passing through that side of France.
2:34 that data is actually outdated, there have been only 13 regions since 2015 or so. The rest is accurate and nicely told up to that point so it's kind of a minor thing though.
Thank you
As Christianity diminishes in the west... so does high birth rates. The void is being gradually filled with atheism which walks hand in hand with low birth rates and destroyed moral boundries. Meanwhile...  The French like Most western nations have embraced " multiculturalism ' and " diversity ' , not forgetting ' islam " to increase its populations. Gradually eroding there own cultures, identities...  resulting in no cohesion and a totally disordered way of thinking ... otherwise known as - Leftist globalist insanity .... which comes from resentment of the west, and hatred of its foundation.... Christianity.
It's easily explained. This is the farming and wine growing district where most produce is grown. Otherwise they wouldn't have food or drink for the table. Every country has large tracts of land for agriculture.
"1/10 in just 4 years" ...how about the Latvian population lost 1/3 in each of WW.
Fun fact if you use this same system like 99.9% of the United States is the same way
They still didn't really explain why.
This is indeed a great place to live. But the main drawback is lack of jobs.
State of Palestine??
French Far Right is becoming a problem
Spoiled by poor grammar. You want to lick the boots of the criminal classes? Go ahead without me.
0:12 india: like france, but with 100% more child labor
There is no state of Palestine and never will be.
Looks a big foot.
And you will find, bizarrely, that the majority living in these areas are right wing xenophobes terrified of being swamped by foreigners.
tldr farmland
A simpler video would be "Why does 90% of  Canada live within 150 miles of the 49th?"
Take the German economy out of this picture and this 60/40 fact would not exist
I knew that Spain was like that but never France
The USA has same " problem". The center of the country is empty, Really empty in hugh swaths, from the Canadian border almost to Mexico. Agriculture, weather, terrain biggest reasons for USA.
or   how to stretch out a rather simple explanation
Why is Jake Peralta narrating this
if the online work keep going as it did during the sanitary confinement, those region will gain a lot of interest... so many peoples only stay in cities because of their work... when you can have a "big" house with a big garden in the rural region at the price you get a very small lodging in the city and you can work from home? You begin to think about it very seriously... and if peoples move there, amenities and (public) services will follow...
Just a note . Palestine is a country which inhibited by Muslims.christians and Jewish
This is a non-story dragged out as though it's some amazing phenomenon.  It's simply a sparsely occupied section of France, and it's nothing compared to western Canada or Siberia.
French citizens are not the only ones that live in France. Citizens may not work in agriculture anymore, but immigrants do.
Literally. He’s comparing the least densely populated province of France with a region of similar size, Palestine… an… urban area… yeah, obviously Palestine’s population density will be extremely higher than the least dense region of France???
I think they don't like their neighbours.
Why were fertilization rates dropping ?
We have something similar in Ireland  ,the east has the densest population ,nearly 3million live in the eastern province  of leinster out of 5million despite  being less thana third of the area and even in leinster half live in dublin which is only anly about 5% of the provinces area.There is an area  in the west the land area of dublin that has only 10%  people as opposed to 1.4million.
When your talking about brilliant you would say them, but one time you said “ours” are you advertising for them or are you part of the company?
Those areas are hardly empty. The USA has many counties that have less than 1 person per square mile.
The state of Palestine?  There is no such place.  For someone discussing geopolitical topics, it would be prudent to understand basic geography.
Yeah? So? Lozere has about 38 people per square mile.  Wyoming has about 6.
More people. More shit. More sewers! No one needs that. France has been around for a long time. It is a beautiful country. What ever they are doing, keep doing it!
Recommend watching video at 1.5x speed
Same in Slavonija, Croatia.
Referred to SIMPLY as "l'hexigone" when "France" is one syllable?
One error in your population density figures: the figure you give for 'England' is actually the figure for the whole UK. The real figure for England is around 420 people per km2 - so around four times that of France.
This is maybe a bit wrong headed approach to a focused study. In today's climate of scientific recognition of anthropogenic overshoot especially.  This seems to focus on the "economic" rather than the reality of the limits to growth.   Unfortunately, existing global technological industrial civilization is a unilateral linear user of resources, not a reciprocal one. One way vs cyclical.   Use of resources of almost 8 billion and growing is currently consuming 1.73 Earth's, or what Earth can be estimated to be taken in a cycle (year) and "replenish". This amount is ever diminishing while exploitation is ever increasing.
there is no such entity as Palestine State.
7:50 o yes, a deselation of Madrid. No sapient life found there indeed
The French countryside is gloriously beautiful ......I know where I'd rather live in France,  Paris is fun to visit but it is too noisy, expensive, and dirty.
Be a lot more People in France if Napolean didnt invade Russia a few years ago
27% of French area is still Colonial occupation, it became blah blah like many european countries because they exploited enough through their colonial occupation's from those colonies, it's enough for next two centuries.
Taking into account the Palestinians only take a fraction of the region that is the West Bank and Gaza, since the Israeli army would demolish any house/infrastructure built out of the middle of urban centers, and also that there are a couple million Israeli settlers taking most of the West Bank region (and adding to the 5Mil figure), the comparison is even more dramatic.
France not even close as big as India sizewise
I wouldn't call it an anomaly for the inland to be less populated that the coast.
Cheesy and unconvincing voiceover
This just is, Youtube channel surprised to learn interland territories or less populated than outerland territories.   If I popped out a population density map of the US, you'd see a big ole "fly-over area" right darn near the middle.  How does this merit a video?
TMI - too many words - this was about as exciting as a conversation about mathematics - in other words, I didn't listen to the end.  as other comments, many other countries have similar empty patches - here in Australia, with the most urbanised population - most live less than 100km from the coast, mostly the east coast, and the huge majority of the inland is almost empty desert.  France - not so much ...
Australia be like: "the surprisingly rare bit of land where there is actually people"
this is most sloppiest researched pieces of pure click-bait I've seen in a long time. The author must have read the book "lying with statistics" as he? cherry picks data and makes absurd statements about it. The very FIRST thing you should have mentioned is that there's the frigging massif central in France.  There. That's it. Highland region. Scarcely developed. End of story. Such a waste of time.
hahaha you should draw a circle in the middle of Australia and see what happens ;)
If France's population had grown as much as Britain's did, between the early modern era and today, there'd be 300 million Frenchmen today
There is no state of Palestine. Never had been.
no such place as palistine
Thanks. That was interesting. Re Brilliant: When will we eliminate all the colleges when everything can be learned on computers?
I'm sorry but too many bullshit comments.
Surprised Gates or Chinese haven't brought the area
Population Density of 30 people per square kilometre ? Gee, in Australia we would call that a crowd.
What absolute nonsense. Have you ever visited or lived in these regions in France? I have lived in the Perigord, the Limousin and Burgundy and I can assure you they are well populated, lively and being recolonised by the city dwellers from outside the region you describe, especially since covid. They are physically and ecologically beautiful regions. Just because they are less populated per km2 than Paris etc does not mean they are empty. The French government has ensured that these regions are well served by iinfrastructure, including roads, rail and public services. These regions are often called the " lungs of France". Forests, rivers and thousands of beautiful villages. A serious analysis of the population density in the regions you outline compared to "well populated" rural regions in the USA, Canada, Australia would expose your analysis as badly flawed.
There is no Palestine, but there is an Israel.
There is no country called Palestine.
France is a perfect example of European greed / Rape / Murder / Not to mention the money the nation made from Slavery . Africa and Haiti has made France what it is today . Centuries of explotatation in the Caribbean. Yes it's a beautiful place . It was made through Blood / Slave  Money 💸
Welcome to Les Gourdiflots! Nothing wrong with this tho, beautiful nature, cheap properties, nice people, and pretty close to the "Dense France"!
He repeats himself over and over again. Was there a point.?! Did he actually say anything that wasn't in the title? I quit watching.
No Jobs apart from agricultural springs to mind. It tends to be the same where ever you go
What about French inheritance law depopulating the countryside?
not gonna lie. i would love to live in comfy french countryside.
I’m moving to Lozere!
So as an Englishman all in hearing is France does have room for the immigrants in Calais.
I would much rather live in a more rural area. But the economy being what it is, kind of impairs it. If I ever find a way to make good money on line, I'll be moving to the countryside permanently. This is interesting. Thank you.
Uhhh have you looked at the US low population swath lately?
I dont find this odd at all. Like ... not even a bit. Why would any country or territory have a homogenous population density?
This video is dumb… u can draw two lines like that in every country and come up with similar conclusions
The state of what?
India is more than six times bigger in area than France. Correct this in your video.
You extend the diagonal through Spain. And it goes through Madrid. The largest city in the country.
Water, Accessabilty, Shopping are important factors, guess water supply is the most important!
Do this for Canada... even the US has large blank spots.
There is no state of Palestine
EU players call it BBB - Big Blue Blob.
They smell War🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🐓🐓🚀🐓🐓🐓🚀🚀🚀🐓🐓🚀🐓🐓🐓🚀🐓🐓🐓🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I really wish there where more french people in the world. Such a cool and wacky group of people.
Bordeax, Perigueux, Lomiges, Angoulele, Toulouse, Angers, Tours and Orleans made deserts Rouen invaded, sacked and set on fire Paris (3 times), Beauvais and Meaux are taken the fortress of Melun laide waste, Chantres occupied, Evreux and Bayeux looted and every town invested (not sure what that means back then) Says Ermentarius of Noirmoutier in the 800s.. so not the first time this has happened eh.. but we know why and who last time around
I loved when he said that France economy was the same as India, not that it's inacurrate, but the nation we're usually compared with is the UK, which I think makes more sense, both are European countries, roughly of the same size and population and with essentially the same GPB.
Everybody wants to live by the water.  end of story.
"France is empty" -laughs in Australian-
Lexagon, I'd call it le nut !!!
This video is 9 minutes too long.
Thank you for enriching my life in France, where I moved 4 years ago.  With Covid, I have not explored much. It is a good time to do the book, or online, research.
"The state of Palestine"... Ummm it still is a territory. If it was a state, Palestinians would be getting a lot less money and more responsibilities...
About 85% oof Australia's 25m people live in the east coast states, and 16m live in the nations 5 biggest cities, all on the coast  Covid and crazy city house prices has seen some people moving to the country.  It will be interesting to see if the trend continues long term.
I'm living in a void 😁 ❤
Your extended "empty diagonal" includes Madrid, a city with a population of 3.3 million people
This is the dumbest video I have ever see. Every country has patch of land that is most ''empty''. What's the point of this video?
The war losses cannot possibly explain why France lost its dominant position - Germany suffered even worse losses in the two world wars. Moreover, it has less coastline. As a Swede, I find the "empty diagonal" to be rather crowded... 😉
So basically Texas
I went on high school exchange somewhere in this empty diagonal about ten years ago. None of my friends from back then still live there, all moved out to bigger cities outside the diagonal😅
The state of Palestine, really?
There is no state of "Palestine"
Nothing wrong with having some elbow room.
Really off-putting voice.
Exactly What is the State of Palestine? The only reason you mention the fictitious country is to further an antisemitic agenda. End of my subscription.
Can you make a video about Morocco?
Did the DNA thing and found 63% of my DNA comes from Lyon. Even though my great grandparents were French, it still came as a shock to have that amount of DNA from one area
Very pretty and green, often. The region around the cave paintings in the Perigord region is well-treed with many green fields. Gorgeous and with castles, and restored and maintained towns that last for centuries because made of stone.
Lots of wars fought in that region I’d imagine
why are you so boring?
State of Palestine? Can't find that one on the map...
Less workers in agricultural 'industry' are needed. Four times less people now. ( see @8:00 )  Four TIMES less people.  Is that 400% LESS people?
There is no Palestin. Only in your dreams.
State of Palestine?  Where is that?  Weirdest comparison I've ever seen
There is no state of Palestine.
Never go to the diagonal of the void. you may never come back.
Dang, that's exactly what I liked best about that part of France, fewer people, most especially, few tourist traps.  Other parts of France are much more enjoyable for other reasons, but again, those tourist traps abound.
BEGAN - past tense of begin.
If I ever go to France I now plan on spending most of my time in that area.
Very informative and interesting video. 😊👍
France use to be Catholic viewing human life as good. Now it is nihilistic and disinterested in perpetuating itself.  Few French are baptized & in the year that Nora Dame burned 600 other Catholic churches were set fire. The consequence of the anti religious French revolution is that it is becoming an Islamic caliphate armed with nuclear weapons.
Yes
I think this will be an unpopular opinion but I actually see this trend as a good thing. Let people live in cities, where they have access to good education, healthcare, culture and public transportation, and let's devote large tracts of land for nature and wild life. It would be better for both humans and the environment.
Why is this an issue? It's very nice to live in a country with less population density. In addition, France's agriculture is very strong and an important exporter. Agriculture needs space. Please also note that French population is growing unlike several other European countries.
i’m gonna take a wild guess and say….  mountains and Farmland?
Massif Central mountains.
Colonizers...450 billion from Africa
👌👌👌
Skip to around 3:20 to actually get to the topic, up until then it's just repeating the same question over and over and over.
This demographic trend in France is actually even more pronounced in the US where there are vast empty spaces and cities and towns that are losing residents even as the country as a whole increases its population.  Even highly populated California has vast open spaces.  I think that this is normal as really should not be considered as a problem.
Sounds like the best bit of France to live! We are way too overpopulated in the UK and the government keeps letting more people in.
Wembley stadium has a capacity of 90,000,.. so 76,000 does not fit into it with 24,000 seats to spare
"The state of Palestine"   Based
And does it provide some quiet locations to live, from first hand experience it is "heaven" in that respect.
Palestine not existed
2:58 No, it's not
This deceiving title sucked me in. Not sure we needed an 11min video to talk about population density in rural/agricultural areas.  Ooo amazing most of the cities are on the coast and along the major rivers.  yawn.
This is the "Diagonale du vide". A really nice place to live
We own a house in that "empty" part of France. In the perigord Noir to be exact. Truest bit of France imho. Not flooded by people of "questionable standards".
People like living near the Coast all over the world, I guess France is no exception.
"Nearly identical in size to India..." India is 6x larger than France...
That empty place outline matches women feet when seen horizontally
"l'hexagone"? More like le pentagone!
there is no State of Palestine, sheer propaganda. Nor has such a state ever existed, unless you refer to the Jewish one, so named by the Romans
I imagine he thinks France is a great country. It's pretty shit these days.
The hissing on s sounds made this unpleasant to listen to.
Can we all just appriecheate his French?
"Why 1/3rd of France is almost empty"  Well, firstly let me waste 95% of this video with random "facts", then I will get to the point of this video at the at the very end, so I can soak up as much viewer time as possible
Kind of a strange perspective. The US has vast swaths of land with considerably lower populations.
Love the state of Palestine
all because of the fellas in Paris
I should move there. Squat an abandoned farm.
France isn’t the same size as India!!! What are you talking about???  India is six times the size of France!!!
Isn’t a bit weird to use “the state of Palestine” as an example. Regardless of politics, it is not (yet) a state, the map is ambiguous and  the population size is debated -around 5 million only if you include Gaza that has a very different population density, is under a different government and is not  a contiguous territory. Surely there are better examples…
I've always thought that overpopulation was a hoax. They've created this term to cover up the fact that all the riches of the world were going to a few fat cats throught taxation and corruption, so they said: "There are too many people in the world".
France looks much more like a pentagon than a hexagon.  What am I missing?
Arbitrary lines give you a story?
Ever drive through Wyoming, Montana, Idaho?   There's nobody there.  Central France is jam-packed comparatively.
I thought the red zones would be part of the explanation.
2:46 YEAAAA he recognizes Palestine as a state!
The losses due to state-sponsored-violence reverberate for generations. I have never understood France's toleration of such huge loss of life. The American Civil War is another example of huge loss. The Civil War was actually the first modern war, with automatic weaponry and powerful cannon fire.
There is no state of Palestine.   However, states which are only de jure states are sometimes recognized as being the legitimate government of a territory over which they have no actual control.
People are going to shit if they ever do one of Australia
It would be remarkable if you could find a country without such an empty area. 80% of France's population is urbanized, so any area avoiding the big cities will have similar statistics.
Uhmmm, France is an agricultural superpower and feeds the EU from it farms. The UK, which you mentioned, cannot by any means feed itself on its own agriculture. France feeds its neighbours.
FRANCE  NEEDS OPEN  BORDERS
Have they consider trying a different narrator to change things up on the this channel?
The first third of this video is basically a hundred different ways of saying 'this part of France is comparatively empty' on repeat.
Plenty of African migrants in France !
That's where the Belgian and Dutch tourists going vacay to Spain drive, makes sense! 😁😂
The Empty Diagonal looks like the shape of a pregnant female.  “La diagonale féminine enceinte” 😂
I thought it was due to the Massif Central mountain range.
oh boy... you should talk about Brazil's density hahahaha
someone should stop this bots who are destroying france... pixel by pixel
Why is the UK is England so populated, but the Celtic Countries not so much, England is 50 million + while the Celtic countries are 10million, despite scotland being huge
Same in Japan
There is nothing special about "empty" regions in countries all over the world. To stay in Europe, even high populated countries like Germany or Beligum have them.  European and World maps of population density prove this.
Palestine is not a country
i cant watch this to the finish. bet it has something to do with mountainrange going through there
Could be used to ''rebalance' the population density, creating new, but smaller sized towns, for a population mostly working in agronomy...
This would have been a three minutes clip.
In Scotland the vast majority of the population live in a narrow strip called the "Central Belt" which, depending on its' definition, has between 2.4 and 4.2 of Scotland's 5.4 million people. I think if the Greater Central Belt is included (From about Aberdeen down to Ayrshire), then I believe that is the area that has the 4.2 million. The bulk of Scotland consists of the Scottish Highlands and islands (with around 9 people per square kilometere (but with many totally empty areas) and the Southern Uplands, with I believe around 22 people per square kilometer. Many people were cleared off the land in the Highlands during the late 18th and 19th centuries, to make way for sheep farming and shooting estates, but parts of it suffered depopulation even since then. The harshness of the climate and the land not being too fertile have contributed to this. Also to some extent, houses being bought up for holiday homes, though in some areas, there are cottages that have been abandoned during the 20th century, but have not been taken over for such purposes.
You've just described world's best vineyards...
Il aurait quand même pu mentionner le Massif central...
Sounds like a good place to live
Yet that third of France is beautiful. You got the Basque country on the South West. Dordogne and Quercy for their authentic villages and food. Lozère with the Cévennes mountains. Burgundy with the vineyards. Auvergne with the ancient volcanoes. Countless river gorges, like gorges du Tarn. The shift from those rural areas is also a good thing if agricultural land is returned as protected land, into forests. The French are moving outside of big cities,  but rather in favor of medium sized cities, like Albi, La Rochelle, Angers, Dijon, Tours, Caen... However, people will tend to choose a mid sized city that is close to a train line, especially a fast train line. This is the case for Poitiers, Tours, Nancy, Dijon... But many cities in that third area are not well connected : Aurillac, Figeac, Clermont Ferrand, Cahors, Rodez ... Those cities are beautiful, but still not that attractive for young couples and young people in general.
C'mon guys, only 2/3s to go
Imagine letting that 1/3 decide your elections? Welcome to the American electoral college.
A real "No shit, Sherlock" vid. What a fucking waste of my time.
That's where they grow the bagguettes
This happens in what they refer to as “flyover states” in the USA.
I dont even need to watch, either A) its farmland or B) its mountainous. Case solved without even watching.
As a socialist country, this is how the government keeps control of the populace.   It in their doctrine to keep people in the cities. while the farmers work to feed them.
the ultimate stupid video. I draw an map of the least poplulated regions of France. Then I ask. isnt is strange there are so few people in this area? and then, don't answer....
Almost every comment has said “the issue with this” etc,  I think it’s a good think that this area is less occupied. France doesn’t need to succumb to urban sprawl and ruin their beautiful country side. Too many Americans are on here thinking with that suburb mentality. Keep cities urban and keep the country rural. Win win.
Lozere is 3 times bigger than Puerto Rico but in my city, Aguadilla lives more  people.
Yeah, as those people who understand sociology, geology, technology, and statistics start to wane - because of low birth rate, etc. - there are no worries because those who don't will move in and replace them, and breed like lobsters, but will move on out when the sewage backs up and the big white BBQ pit in the bathroom don't work no more(!)
The UK has a population density of 270. *England*, as you said, has a population density of 432...
You should do the empty central interiors of African countries.
😍 8:16 shows the white cliffs of England across the Channel. 🥰
This is every country except for the small highly populated ones
I pray Pen wins the Presidential election. I like Macron a lot but he is too soft! The Algerian, Moroccan, Tunisian, blacks there require a strong hand and only then will stop these terror  acts, vandalism of public structures and private cars, holdups, indecency, loud and vulgar speech and behavior in public and so.on.and on. Vote for Le Pen to save France/Decency/EU/Civlization.
Maybe this is the place, the unfriendly french campers come from? :)
Much of that area, at least in the southern part, is hot, dry and full of nasty bugs (e.g. "aoutas") in summer, and is just bloody desolate (and cold) in winter. To actually live there year-round is not fun.  Source: spent too much time there when family tried to restore an old chateaux. Bitter cold winters, miserable summers, absolutely gorgeous in spring and (late) fall.
Petition for this guy to stop calling countries ‘she’ ‘her’   1 like = 1 vote 🗳
I never in my live heard of L'hexagon.
In the area of the PA (there is no such state as Palestine) there are some 3.5m pepole
Bruh i lives there.... Rude.
Same thing can be said about the US.
Why is Montana, Nevada, Utah and many other US states sparsely populated?  Who cares?
Bill gates! Look at all the space, you told us the world is overpopulated. Change your plan Billie, we don't need swabbie's  big city plans..
My dad recently moved from Paris to the countryside in Chitenay so next time I go to see him I’ll be in the middle of nowhere
Summary: Farmland needs fewer people.
I would love to live in the empty area!  Imagine how quiet and peaceful it must be...
Palestine was big, their land is getting invaded, the people are getting killed, just like in Ukriane, the difference is no one seems to support them because of their race and religion, that's fcked up
Do you please have an estimate for the total population in that area? One for that part in France, one for that part in Spain?
Video starts 3:29
05:40 you mentioned all tgis cities in french except for paw reese...
Thats the Population dencety which should be around the whole world
Bullshit. Apples and oranges. Plus the northernmost line looks exaggerated.
Can we make it 3 3rds?
France is 6 times smaller than india
At least France has not abandoned the region. As I understand there have been huge investments into high speed internet.
Well I did the opposite, moved away from living in cities to a small mountain town. I will never come back to live like a rat in the city again...
Bull shit, France has the highest growing demography in Europe...
That area is filled with... Mountains covered by very dense forest. That's why. Get informed
This made me realize just how HUGE America is.
I lasted one minute and 19 seconds.  Couldn't take anymore.
The music in this video is so calming.
Seems like he US’s central states. Mostly empty. Montana? Wyoming? Nevada? Shit’s empty af. The capital cities are big bt the rest of the state is empty af. And that’s how most of those states are.
I watched this on Nebula, but it doesn't have a comments section, so I've come over here to express my disappointment. Most of the information given in this video is about French demographics in general and have nothing to do with the region in question. I just wasted 11 minutes of my life to be told that the area is empty because people don't want to live there, which is a third-grade level of answer.
NORTHEAST GA is FULL!!!
I'm French so what the Big deal here ?
just leave it be, don't let the governments fuck it up and in 2-3 generations will be fine (if that's actually a problem at all). Cheaper and quicker transport and especially Internet and remote work will solve it.
make it into a beautiful retirement strip
Humans tend to destroy everything around them with no consideration for anything else. Consequently, how much land should be reserved for everything else that exists?
because the flag has the white third, obviously.
The states of the United States have their own individual sovereign governments. The relationship of an individual state to the US is more akin to the relationship of France to the European Union.
No french people that looks like the best part of France
is that the FFC? French Flyover Country.
@1.31: Map is wrong, look at the South East border next to Italy and it looks like a forest but in real life, it is heavily populated.
Not having so many civilians but still enough for a comfortable country is better than more because the civilians will have a more comfortable time with  a bit of privacy, I live around Paris and its like a desert where I live, by desert I mean everyone's minding their own business or in their home
0:12 India is six times larger than France, disappointed hearing from geography related channel
Makes perfect sense, given most people live closer to water that the middle of the country is emptier. Also living on the Belgium border has proved to be a pretty poor choice for the last 100 years.
The same is true in the USA.  Washington DC and the surrounding counties are the richest in America. But 184 miles from Washington DC is the state of West Virginia.  West Virginia is one of the poorest state in the Union.  Washington DC is a problem for the transportation industry.  The only product of Washington DC is Bull S***.  So when a trucking company delivering paper to Washington DC,  it leaves empty.  Why can't Washington beauracies locate to West Virginia?   With the advent of internet,  and cell phones,  Bull S*** can be produced in West Virginia as easily as Washington DC.
so... Mountains and farmland are less populated then average.  Who knew?
Which means that the empty area has less contamination
I bet that's where the most decent French people live. City people blow taint lmao 🙃
Now do the Scottish highlands; you’ll find a population density a quarter of the French diagonal….
Correction, there is no state of Palestine, all of that land belongs to Israel.
I want to live there. Things are bad when you think it's getting to busy in Lincolnshire.
Now do Australia
Now with work from home hopefully people will escape the crowded cities, already cities like Reims and Orleans, on the edge of the diagonal are getting more crowded.  A couple of TGV stations in the diagonal with connection to Paris should sort this situation in 10 years or so.
la diagonale du vide : the emptiness diagonal
I used to live in a village that at one point had two hotels, a police station, a cobbler, two cafés, a food store and a general store. When I moved there it had all gone, there wasn't even one café or a bread shop. There were ten houses for sale. The village wasn't even well kept up, the mayor said that they had no funding, it's a viscious cycle as less infrastructure means less people, means less money coming in. I left during first lockdown.
When I moved to France in 1978 a great many people had secondary homes in the countryside but over the years with more pressure on work and higher taxes and upkeep costs these have mostly gone with people prefering holidaying elsewhere other than to a static second home. There are still towns with a very high % of secondary homes owned by foreigners and these are mostly empty most of the year. I live in Dordogne which is happily within your diagonal but it does get very busy in summer months with a great many gites and RBNB homes. Paris in 1978 was relatively quiet and I lived in the center which was quite affordable then. Today Paris is a smelly dump full of homeless and gypsies and trash of all sorts and I dread having to go there now.
People do be living in cities tho
"state of palestine " ?? 02:47 There is no such country and it's not recognized by any other country .. better call it gaza strip and they got 2 million citizens and not 5 !!  please be acurate..
Dude that border with Spain is not landlocked in the slightest Like wtf are you talking about?
May be French love to be near sea haha.
In a world where totalitarians are aggressive, the free world need strong leaders to stand up for democracy against dictatorship.
You should talk about "Spanish Siberia"
What is the state of Palestine?
Sounds like my kind of place to live; too bad I never learned to speak French in core but hey that's life.
There is an answer...It's called extreme wealth and villas in the countryside. It's always existed in European history. Allow tax exemptions for the rich in the depopulated areas and you will fill the empty region.
Your music and speaking at the same time is interfering. Did you not want your audience to hear your words? It drowns your words. It's Irritating.  Counterproductive.
Water... it's water... look at the rivers
Those living in the empty belt like it this way. Its peaceful and still genuinely French
that's not the size pf palestine. Palestine is one third of that because Israel occupies the rest.
Tell me please, "Where is the state of Palestine? It doesn't exist now nor has it ever.
I'm french but I didn't know that I lived in this diagonale 🤣 I thought that the diagonale was supposed to end near the southwest
France has an area of 544,000km2.  A few years ago I was in living the the Western Australian wheatbelt. It has an area of 154,000km2 and just 75,000 people. In other words the area is about the same size as the diagonal in France and with a population of the smallest region in that area.   Both are agricultural areas. I'm sure you will find the same in every agricultural area in the developed world where commercial farming requires fewer and fewer people each year.  Generally this is a positive. Fewer people involved in agriculture means that food costs a small fraction of our incomes compared with the past where food was the main cost.
France is not a nation. French is a nation. Nation is people not a territory.
2:46 State of Palestine?  Israel recognizes Palestine, but Palestine don't recognize this state! Are you forcing that upon the Palestinians?
I live on the edge of that diagonal and believe me it's mainly a geographic reason ! the topography makes it crazy long to get anywhere. It's all ups and downs over and over again while doing constant left rights on the winding roads. From where I am it takes the same time to get to Marseille (320 Km) as it takes to get to the other side of my department (150 Km) : 3 hours by road
Confusion regarding less versus fewer. Needs an editor.
Weird
Imagine how much of the US is empty, including Alaska. Half? 2/3rds?
"empty void"?
If you think the empty rectangle is cool, Careful what you wish for I thought the same and paid the price; I have been living in in this small town for almost a year now and I haven't made a single friend. Compared to making a dozen friends in two weeks in a city around Lyon.   There are no open bars, there are no restaurants and the supermarket closes at 19 hours and opens at 9 so yeah if I'm late at work, no food till next day if I hopefully manage to get off work early enough.   The ever empty streets give a feeling of dread and loneliness as if living in a ghost town.  And the nature? I genuinely fear for my life every day going in and back from work as I traverse the strip of road out of town with no lights and the sounds of creatures I do not want to imagine.   Fuck this uninhabited shit, I'm looking for any job in a real city where there are humans around, restaurants, activities and public transport.. where there is human civilization  Ah btw the prices are higher. Housing is nonexistent so you pay whatever the landlord asks for when by some miracle you get an opportunity for an apartment of studio. I pay three times my consumption rate in electricity because the cost of having electricity in this shithole in the first place is three times your consumption rate, so I turn off the heater during winter unless I'm absolutely freezing.  In a normal city I used to pay 350 euros for a studio, fully equipped, gas water and electricity included. In this shithole I pay 400 for a non furnished studio and 200-100 for electricity and there is no gaz.  And my groceries now cost around 3 times as much.  Fuck this shithole, stay in the cities
Takes too long to come to the point.
british=french
This video is stupid.    It is okay that France has a large swath of farmland.    The idea that a country should be made up of densely packed cities is ludicrous.
The world has too many tiny countries       comment for algorithm   IMO ALLEGEDLY
French Fries , French Kiss. French Toast, I like France
Maybe they'r keeping empty space for Dutch and Belgian, to preserve west europians. They are moving too much east (EU) anyway.
so.  now do texas.  densities vary.
so during a time when peasants sought better opportunities in big cities, the first world war killed the region's fathers? did i hear that right?
Palestine?
I live in the Empty Diagonal. It's quite nice.
Too bad Brilliant doesn't teach basic English - the writers for this video could use lots of help.
They should give each Department equal representation in government. So the small Departments have political power equal to the more densely populated Departments. That way, the small departments   can dictate how the government operates. Just like the USA.
Seriously? 1/3rd? Are you surprised by that? Have you been to France? It IS a filthy shit hole. I can't believe anybody lives there.
the state of palestine have much less then 5 milion people .more like 3/
as a french fellow I swear this "empty third" is so rich of wonderfull landscapes
2:11 To give you more perspective, France's empty diagonal has the same density as the USA, therefore the USA is empty.
Are population density and economic prosperity uniformly distributed in ... _checks notes_ ... France? The answer may shock you!
0:55 Les hexagones sont les bestagones
now do wyoming
France identical size to India?!?
No mention of plague / pandemics and the migration to Canada and French Guiana !
france no:7 in economy with the money of african people.
So it’s kinda like the American Midwest.
Meanwhile Canada 4ppl/km^2
So it's basically a larger Pennsytucky?
The state of palestine ????
Calls Palestine a state min 2:45  Officially my favorite YouTuber
Sum total of this video: agricultural areas aren't as densely populated as metro areas + paid advertisement. that's it.
Bel'R'Us
This is wonderful.I love France and didnt know this.
2:41 Lozere should be renamed Heaven. Lining in such a low density area sounds awesome
Honestly this video shows a possible good reason to invest in rural areas. If things like transportation, ammenities, more job oppertunities are brought to these rural areas they could attract people away from the cities and reduce the strain they are undergoing like high housing costs and traffic congestion while also rejuvinating the declining rural cities.
there is no such thing as Palestine. The map you showed in the video is "the West Bank" that was captured by ISRAEL from JORDAN in 1967.
More people need to take up farming or rural occupations.
This is all the better as it pertains to UN Agenda 2030 and the world economic forum plans for totalitarian evil globalist control and domination. They want everyone to live in compressed city/metropolitan areas where they can be most easily surveilled and controlled.
“Wow, we really do be living in cities” so insightful and poetic
You talk too much...
Well, nice to know. Agree with William Drijver 3 down. Throw the dice at Australia and Canada. See what you get!
Well, so canada is emptier than france
The coastline thing makes a lot of sense. Not to be America-centric because I hate it here, but the US is really similar with the east and west coast. While there's the other reasons mentioned, it seems like a really fundamental part of population density amongst lots of countries.
france looks more like a pentagon
With working remotely becoming a realistic alternative - not just a pipe dream enjoyed by a few highly paid workers - I suspect this is going to change. Its not workers who are going to want this, but companies will see the benefit of essentially opening up their job market to the world - not just their expensive cities. They have more choices for employees, and they don’t have to pay as much. But remote workers can build more wealth as they can live in locations with a lower cost of living. There are a lot of administrative jobs that can be performed anywhere, especially given satellite internet can run at decent speeds (for work). That means that the French countryside might be appealing to many people, especially since you don’t need to live in crowded, expensive cities - and most amenities are available with the same internet connection required for work. If you aren’t into high culture or require season tickets to a big league team, you pretty much have the same amenities in many rural areas that you have in huge metropolitan areas, but without the headaches. And given its France, I’m sure people won’t have problems getting French food (lol!). I therefore see this trend reversing, as many French families seeing that there are more advantages of living in this so-called empty quarter than in the Parisian region.
If this is France just imagine countries that used to be colonies like Uruguay lol
Real life lore you should do a video on nebula about the Yemen civil wars please
almost as empty as an icensalt tower
France top 5 most ungrateful nations on earth don’t even celebrate D-day behind Germany the biggest back stabbers of the west but I guess Biden forced them to take Russian oil since cheaper and cleaner American oil was worse for the climate I guess than Russias there’s really no excuse other than it’s what his Chinese lobbyist want or simply pay Russia back for the $5 million they gave him as Vice President thank you Hunter for the laptop😁sorry Europe your going through another war that’s what happens when America has a leader that wears diapers and can’t speak without a teleprompter
Imagine the netherlands with nearly 500 people per square kilometre:0
Wait until this guy hears about northern Canada 🇨🇦 😳
Thats asterix village
Where is palistine? It is called Gaza
Your videos are the best
Feels like RLL forgot to answer the titular question.  Urbanisation and declining population density in rural areas is a worldwide phenomenon. So it would've been interesting to hear why this region specifically suffers from that. I think a lot of interesting comments could have been made about the geographical and historical perspectives;  - Do hills in that region prevent ease of access?  - Is the soil particularly fertile or catered to certain crops? - Is there a lack of rivers or road connectivity that caused a (historic) lack of city development?  As for the "most people live <100 km from the ocean" argument: The southwestern part of the diagonal ends in the ocean, whereas the densely populated region bordering Germany is thoroughly landlocked.  How does that fit into the theory? Btw, shoutout to that seemingly comepletely arbitrary extension into Spain. Even just at a glance it appears to hold no merit whatsoever.)  Don't get me wrong, I usually enjoy RealLifeLore's videos a lot, but this one just seems to be cutting corners way more than I've seen in their content.
2:48 "state of palenine"? What is palenine? Did anyone say this is a country? Keep your facts straight buddy.
be glad of these empty spaces, because in England we have none
Cause those area's are as boing as Jersey
France is also the less polluted country in Europ:))
As a French, i greatly appreciate your work sur la diagonale du vide and every arguments you found are true and thats pretty sad but in the other hand, its allows th country to benefit from thousands of free acres to harvest crops to feed the population in the cities...
RealLifeLore is going to get cancelled because he referred to Palestine as a place
How many subscribers from Sri Lanka
RLL: Why is 1/3 of France almost empty? Me: I give up. French Guy: Hey that's my line!
2:45 There is no “State of Palestine.” Why choose this as your example, unless you are trying to start an argument that has nothing to do with the population of France? 7:04 From one landlocked area to another which is... obviously not landlocked. Also, the eastern side of France is almost entirely landlocked, yet is more populous.
0:09 Precisely, the French government should pay all the descendants of its slaves around the world the equivalent in today's money for all the work they've done for them.
Because they ran away..
Pretty sure every high population country of significant size has the same "anomalies ".
1:54 ah Auxerre, I'm from there 😄. I'm happy that you acknowledged my pretty town!
u think thats empty u ought to see australia
99.9% of the Earth's surface is empty. You could fit every human on Earth inside the borders of Delaware and they would still be 3 feet away from each other.
wait, what JAPAN?
I dont know what the population of all of sweden is but i know that Härjedalen which is a county in sweden has a population densitie of 0,8 persons per square kilometers
What are some cities that are in that part?
I want to live in that diagonal!
You should make a video on the Brazil and Paraguai zone that is disputed by both countries. And this has nothing there till today
Wrong map of Palestine
Because that is the black and immigrant part if you have traveled in that part you would not have to ask that question once out side the capital  it is plain for all to see most of them came from french Morocco,but now having heard about all the free things that are available,Thayer are moving over hear as displayed imagrants
Can you do what if the byzantine empire or German empire reunited today, pls
Answer: population density is lower in rural areas. Saved you 11 minutes.
there is no state of palenstein.............
France is been in war since 15th to 19th century.
In a future video you could explain why Germany's population is so evenly spreaded out compared to other countries
… we ATE them all… YES Julius Caesar was a CANNIBAL .!
You don't need to fully populate land area. Best without people lol.
Same explanation as every countries face
The central massive If I recall is sparsely populated.
In all countries people always ran away from regions with unfertile land, harsh weather, mountain and recently from unpopulated regions. No difference for france. Napoleonic wars and ww2 have nothing to do with the above topic and very little with france population growth during the past centuries. The french revolution has everything to do with stagnant french demography. Indeed with it came the end of primogenitur... (google it up if needed) Wealth and farms were from then on divided equally between all children once the parents passed away...so small families was the french norm from then on much before all other european countries. Yes...Youtubers are often total bs artists.
I think you misspelled Yisrael my friend
Belaruhs?
Ha ha ha, shows how out of touch I am. When he said 30people per km, I totally thought that was a lot of people. I'm used to people pointing out we have 4 people per km here.
There is NO "state of Palestine." Why should I believe anything else you say?
👍
👍
Well, it isn't
Try doing this for America qne you will find the same issue for the  Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.  this is why those areas are often called flyover country.       Perhaps try counting something like stoplights per 10,000 miles squared or the ratio of cows to people.
@reallifelore FYI your “Syria’s Stalingrad” video stops playing at the 3 second mark. I’ve tried it on 3 devices. It’s the only video of yours that doesn’t play.
No such thing as Palestine
And as cities across the world quickly are becoming entirely unaffordable to all but the upper middle class and shorelines recede worldwide we'll start to see this trend reverse.
there is no such a state as palestine shame on you ! god gave israel to the jewish nation please don't say lies!
Buffer... Electromagnetic disturbance area stones of carnac
The French economy largely has the wealth and exploitation of Africans that they still hold in a vice to this very day to thank for being the 7th largest in the world.
Wtf is Palestine
Does every place on the planet have to be packed with wall-to-wall bodies to be 'healthy'?     I think *not* ...... Why can't we say France is blessed with a bit of parky open space in its interior?
Poorly researched and factually incorrect. I’ve unsubscribed. Good luck with the channel
Sounds very similar to the dying rural areas of the "Rust Belt" in the US. Middle class jobs are hard to come by. Density continues to drop, towns shrink as commercial ventures lead a mass exodus. And skyrocketing crime and drug use.
Imagine looking at the serene countryside and thinking "how can I fix this"
not really a story here; please find a country that is homogenous to the extent of 2:1 in population density across all areas
In Russia - Ukraine war, France has surrendered.
stopped watching after graphic comparison with "the state of palestine". There is no such state. Could have pick any tiny country, really, but chose to go for "bold"? "Unnessessary wiseass-ness.
there is no state of palestine and never was!!!!!!!!!
That "state" of Palestine line
There is no state of Palestine.
There is NO STATE OF PALESTINE... LIars.
From rural wisconsin here, pop density locally 6.8 people per kilometer. Im like, dang that french things crowded 🤣😅🤣
You can explain a lot of the distribution by proximity to navigable water- not just the ocean and sea, but also the Rhine, Rhone, and Seine rivers.
Good to know that France is close to 69 million people
France is NO LONGER any power of any kind due to woke leadership and open borders. Urban areas are an open Cesspool. The sewers are no longer just underneath France. They are top side as well.
What/where is Palestine? A big thumbs down vote for this YT video.
That moment when he says the void only has 30 persons per square km so you calculate the population density for your entire country and get around 3,5 people per square km 😳 I live in Iceland
The “diagonal” is the heart of France. The geography, the people and the Cuisine, is the best in France. As an expat having lived there, I would not hesitate to say that it is heaven on Earth.
make a video about dividing czechoslovakia because i thing it is very good example how countries should get along.
sadly, around the world there will be so few farmers left we will all starve....  We need to grow future farmers so we can grow future human beings ..
“Palestine” is not a country.  You should get your facts right before you broadcast lies to your viewers.
Frenchagons are bestagons
If you're from Paris and you go to the country side,  they're staring at you like of you're from another star system...
One cannot have "4 times less" - you mean either a quarter or one fourth.
People live near the coast. 40/60 isn’t a huge difference either.
Low population density eh? * laughs in central canada * there is nobody here, just dying deadend towns and endless farms, an area the size of Luxembourg here can easily have a population less than a 100th the population of Luxembourg
How does France the same size of India- France is 550K sq Km , India is 3.26 Million sq Km?
Speaking of French demographics, an interesting question would be why France lost the race to populate the New World with willing settlers despite its huge population back home.
All came to uk in boats
Why is this EMPTY?   Why don't I mute your channel for a year?
Probably it's good for the environment and for nature to have such "unpopulated" areas.
It made for surreal motorbike tour from north to south , it was like having the place to myself with many many hidden gems .
damn that transition game is smoooooooooth.  Linus would be jealous
Lol Palestine
Better to say it another way; the rest of France is overpopulated.
This guy can’t even pronounce Belarus correctly. Not going to give too much credence to his theories.
its farming land right, i dont think the french have any trouble fucking. thats there tocken in the EU.
Wait until this guy sees a demographic map of the US
The state of Palestine? Five million people? Kinda diminishes the red of this video.
So does this account not recognize Israel as a country? He said Palestine
India is 5 times the land area of France
This is like these stat guys finding records to the players they want.
So this is how Luxembourg and Belgium are going to invade Spain, just go through the void
It's really not that empty.  The presenter does not know empty. Clickbait
wow
So I'm still not sure what the problem is.
Ehh, America and China also have places with these empty spaces. From geography, to economy, and more, it’s just natural. But unless these spots have some niche to them, there will continue to degrade in population.   There is a specific state in American where you can rent an office space but have little to no one to staff it - the niche to this was the specific state had the least tax so businesses start get more income.   Maybe it could do a niche like this or discover resources or alternatively generate resources, develop the province, that and more. Do want some more experts to give out their opinions.
Most of my family left France in the 1550s. And except for WW1 and WW2, and an occasional visit, we never went back.
There is NO State of Palestine....
Is why doesn't France have States but Germany does aren't they the same type of government?
As an Aussie, I do not find this weird or concerning. In fact, it makes me consider moving there.
if paraphrasing every other sentence to boost your essay word count was a video
yeah ik that line is just...the void of world lmao there is only old people and farm
we have been in rural areas of France where the villages are almost empty
France is the same size as India?
State of Palestine. Can't find it  on my map.
This will change in the near future... This land will soon be very attractive when the seasides will be inhabital...
I'm Italian, I couldn't care less. But  because I feel like I'm a little different than the others I think I'll watch this, it's interesting anyway.
Wow, people actually do be living in cities
lol
Why is mars MT ?
The vacant area looks like a bra
Been there. It is almost scary how desolate some regions look and feel. I was running ambulance repatriations of injured or sick vacationers to Germany and Switzerland from France. Passing through these regions at night is almost scary because of the pitch black Night and no signs of Life anywhere.
Seems like a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle. BTW, you really need to fix your pronunciations of the following words: – _kilometres_ is pronounced like "nanometres" or "metres", not "thermometers" and "barometers" because it's a unit of measurement, not a measuring device. "Kilometers" would be devices that measure kills, something that would be useful in games like Call of Duty. – _Belarus_ is pronounced "bell-ah-roos", not "bell-ah-russ".
If you look at the density maps of the South American countries you’ll see that half of the territory is empty specially for those countries which include the Amazonas jungle
Sounds like the French men need to start scoring more often. Think of it as saving the French nation! Do your part! Viva LaFrance!
Would be interesting to do the same with Spain. We have the same problem here, with the "empty Spain"
As a french ,I dont think the diagonale is bad ..But i think we should put more big cities in it that will be used as pole area for the near rural villages..We should not fill entirely the diagonale but redynamize it ,we are only 7th power in the world but we have the geographic and demographic potential to be 4th or 5th ,or atleast beat the Rosbif and the Boches
That McDonald's briefly shown at the beginning  is apparently the most popular in the World with about 5000 meals served daily. It's located in the Champs-Elysées.
wtf is the state of palestine
Hi, I’m from this area, it’s fun to live here and actually very beautiful place, just, there isn’t a lot of thing to do, but a lot of thing to see
0:05 France is 4th most populous nation in Europe, not 3rd
0:12 uh ? France is almost 5 times smaller than India...
FREE PALESTINE
👍👍👍
*chuckles in Australian*
Video idea: "If all muslim countries would become one."
Nice video.
WOW France is so bad that France people don’t wanna live in it
I'm sorry but I would prefer living in a less population density area than in a high population area.
Most of America is unoccupied land and Farmed land.  Most of our population live in the Huge Sprawling Cities for convenience sake.  And many in our population would rather not work in DIRT to be a FARMER.  That would be considered "beneath" their status.
So this "void" diagonal is 3 times more densely populated that my country.
This phenomenon is normal because of economic specialization driven by technology and cheap energy. It's much more costly to supply scattered settlements with utilities, transportation, food/groceries, health care, and even internet service. In many countries as city living are being improved with better social life, health care, services that take care of chores, housing affordability and of course easy transportation, rural areas are getting even less attractive. Even though this results in wasting rural resources like housing stock, infrastructure, and historical identity, the economic gain of urbanization is much higher. Yes there will be introverts and religious groups moving to rural areas to get away from others in cities, and remote work plus internet services will make this more attractive, it will only be so in very crowded and expensive countries like California and Germany etc. If one day energy is no longer cheap then there will be massive emigration out of the cold or arid countries or metropoli to the fertile river regions of the world, like France or the Mississippi basin.
One city had 77000 people lol and that's classed as empty city ??? I'm confused and after its farm land so this is BULL
I like space
They could settle this Area with British Refugees (if Germany starts a "special Operation across the Channel)
It's rural.   Same reason rural America doesn't have many people.   Pretty simple.
So it’s their American Midwest. :)
India's got the Worlds 3rd largest economy. this guy's spewing bs
Mmh.. not very consistent reasoning when you talk about the diagonal projections in Spain. Your point is streched a bit too much here.. if you draw a diagonal in spain you will include the Bilbao area which is highly populated, as well as Madrid of course, and finish south with a lot of cities with a high density such as Malaga, Granada and so on.
11 min of bullshit nonsense when even a 5yo can figure out why that region has low population: fucking mountains.
Man why u gotta do my home state like that
State of Palestine? Never heard of this place. And for sure that region don't have a population of 5M...
I visited the center of France in 1982 and saw something about the government paying them to have babies!
Fewer people not less people.
What state of Palestine?
And then they expand the less densely populated area to Spain and include... Madrid. FAIL!
I live in France but i am Here in Normandie, i speak french 😅
" State of Palestine"? You mean the country of ISRAEL.
I started watching this video because I live in the "empty" area in the thumbnail lmaoo
When France dominate Europe, Europe dominate the world. When France doesn't dominate Europe, Europe is dominated by USA and now more and more China. Love this fact
RealLifeLore: talking about what’s happening in the world and why gamers: what is **grass?**
Literally over halfway into the video before we get a “reason” that the diagonal is sparsely populated… in the first five minutes you have restated that the area has low population about 10 different times/ways.  Waste of time
Just Geography , the massive central doesn't support large population centres..High plateau, very harsh environment
This is the biggest bullshit I had ever seen in my life xD
looks like france's map is a star.
This video could be so boring and unintresting but i would still watch becuase of his nice voice
bombastic exaggerations
I live in that diagonal 😭
we’re a third of the way there, lets keep going
Why? The highlight starts at 8:00 getting to the point of this video's title and it ends at 9:17.
F U MAN WE ARE 3.5 TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY 😎
"Palestine" is not a country.
2:45 the state of what? That's no such state called "Palestine"
French Revolutionary inheritence laws also incentivised having less children. This must be mentioned aswell. If Ancien Regime continued under reformed administration, even if the same wars happened(which would not), France arguably would still be the most populous European state.
When i think about France I think about Ramanez la coupe la maison !!
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays from 9:30 to the end of the video?
When i was younger, i used to be obsessed with geography  *nothing changed*
Bit meaningless trying to answer this question. No one says we have to live equally distributed across the land, do they?
Lmao there is no palestine
Why does it matter?  Enjoy the space… there are parts of the USA that are sparsely populated.
This made me realize how evenly populated my homecountry Germany is. Apart from a few areas in the center and the east
I have no idea what is the point of this video!
No people sounds like bliss
By this logic.. the US is empty af!
I live in the "diagonale du vide" and I love it
France should keep it that way... it preserve the natural beauty of the country...
This boring
I live in Fargo ND and pretty much the heart of "fly over country" number 1 issue I hear about from rural areas is lack of high speed internet. Second thing I hear is lack of small manufacturing. There is a digiKey near by which does exactly what you think keys that use a wireless signal but we nees more small scale local production to boost local industry. This is not just a US thing but a global one as well.
Simple, move the capital city to the center of the country.
"palestine"
I live in cornebarrieu in france
This is what you do when you run out of real content topics, you try to force invent topics
1/4 medieval ages 1/5 Napoleonic wars and 4 most populous country 10% of males died in war Agricultural land, far from sea Continues into Spain
Hexagon is bestagon
🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
France is not identical in size to india ,its way smaller than india
the actual denomination in French is actually "diagonal of emptiness" (diagonale du vide), which is much more demeaning than "empty diagonal" (diagonale vide).
For a long time, France was the "China of Europe"
I don't know about anyone else, but I don't think a 60/40 split is all that remarkable.
density of Malta meanwhile... 1600 ppl per sqm :(
"state of palestine"  based
France: "A major global great power for centuries", I dont think so, you must have been reading the French version of World History and based your commentary on fairy tales not fact. From major losses against England at Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourts, Plassey, The Nile, Trafalgar, Spanish Peninsular, Seven Years War in Canada and North America, Waterloo, Franco-Prussian War, War in Mexico, abject failure in WW1 and total defeat and subjugation  in WW11, not to mention Dien Bein Phu Indo China, Algeria 1958 - 62, the French have largely been a nation of losers. Only Napoleon I,  has had any real power and that only in Europe for a brief spell between 1795 and his total annilation at Waterloo in 1815 at the hands of the Duke of Wellington and Marshall Blucher . Since then France has been led by a bunch of wannabees including Napoleon III, Petain of Vichy France fame, DeGaulle, Gisgaurd Distank, Chirac, Sarkozy, Hollande now Petite Macron to name but a few. Frances strength today only lies in fact that it has nuclear weapons, that are not part of Nato?. The French people and their armed forces have been betrayed for centuries. Ask any Frenchman how many of their counrymen waded ashore on June 6th 1944 and they will look away......
We are really overpopulated 😂
The abandonment of the countryside all over Europe saddens me a lot. I understand that it's only logical given the automation in the farming sector, but still it is very sad to see more and more people leaving the beautiful countryside and arriving in increasingly soulless metropolises.  Plus the power of rural folk in parliament diminishes as their population dwindles.
So what?
It is really surprising when I flew in to Bordeaux I took a train to come to the tiny town of Cognac which was lovely to have the most beautiful view in landscape!
Palestine is not a state
If you look at the density of highways, it is also much worse in this region.
Vendée is the best part of France, bye 👋🏼
I live in that zone, grew up in that zone. Not empty.
Actually in Lozère (in "Les Laubies") great vidéo even in France this subject isn't discussed a lot and i learned 1 or 2 things thanks to you
Just fly over the US and you will see that more than half of it is empty
this message from "diagonale du vide" with love ^^
Demographic winter. Explains it all. People stopped having kids, and the consequence of this having no households to keep up society. There’s a reason mankind was commanded to multiply and replenish the Earth.
TFW u live in one of those areas
amazing
You should make a video about how populate is the Center of mexico, and had the half of mexico population
The US has an empty Center.  If you consider the Great Lakes region to be the "North Coast", and the Gulf coast being the "South Coast", most of the US population is along the four coasts, leaving the center of the country quite empty.  The only large non-coastal cities in the USA are Dallas, St. Louis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. All other large cities are on or very close to these 4 coasts. And apart from the 8 metropolitan areas I listed, most of the Center is empty, especially the Western half of the Empty Center.
The central and widest part of the Empty Diagonal is a hilly and forested region called the "Massif Central", which is fairly similar to Appalachia in the USA.  At the south western extreme of the Diagonal, you have a swampy forested region called Les Landes, which is truly the least densely populated region of France.  The only part of the Diagonal that truly fits your description as being mainly agricultural is the north-western third.
200peeps km^2 😂😂... We gawts 1000 km^2.   Chances are if im sitting at a traffic stop, someone's invading my personal space. You're on your phone and all of a sudden u notice a pair of eyes from the bus next to your car staring at your phone. U say 'bro wtf, i was typing in my password, y ew look'. They reply, been stuck in traffic for hours, my phone's battery died, passing some time by looking at yours now.... WWYD?
same goes for kansas
Why do people live in the coastline?
Huge respect to the creator for saying the country of palestine! Calling countries what they are not what they used to be thousands of years ago. Subscribing!
Its every country - USA , China , Canada ..  and im sure every country . Usa for example  have states the size of Germany that have population of 500 000 .
You STILL haven’t learned how to pronounce Belarus.
Wat, for Germany why don't you compare the population densities of eastern and western Germany? :-p
I feel like this is every country. There is always a reason for living in one place vs another.
65 million not 68 million
2:56 your maths is wrong, there would be 14,000 empty seats
My France 🇫🇷🇫🇷🥰
At the 3 minute mark in the video and what makes this so bad???
Why haven't the Dutch colonized it yet?
Plenty of land space for returned failed asylum seekers!!
This makes me want to move to one of those least poplulated but wonderfully green and scenic rural areas of France. Get an old stone house, fix it up and live in peace and quite.
Most popular French saying...... "we surrender"
And should be left empty. We dont have to populate every corner of the Earth
So THAT'S why the flag has a missing stripe! I always knew the flag looked off. As soon as people move their due to overcrowding, I'm sure that blank spot will gain some color.
Does anyone know where they got that population density map?
But why do you have to populate everything , just let the nature be at peace if it is there
U should do a video what if nato united as a country
The French triangle
On appelle ça la "diagonale du vide" mais en vrai c'est la diagonale du paradis pour ceux qui kiffent les plaines rurales et les beaux champs de blés.
Dude, you realise you put Madrid (most populated city in Spain) in the middle of your diagonal?!
I'm struggling to understand the problem, your population will be concentrated into key economic areas while any left over land can be left to nature or agriculture or cheap industrial land, Humans kept in concentrations usually leads to improved innovation and logistical efficiency.
starting to be convinced that some of ur videos are bs
Been here since the first 25,000 subs... you now have 5.5M. you've come a long way
France looks more like Patrick the star to me
I donno why it is a matter, there are many more countries with lesser population density than this video showing places.
How’s it called a Hexagon if it looks more like a Pentagon (5sides)
Thanks for talking about this ! I consider it as the most relevant problem of my country. I'm living just next to the east north east of what french people called "the diagonal of the void", talking about it like it was the Mordor. But having my grand-grand parenthood on my father side coming from there, I love these lands (especially north side obviously), and it's a dramatic situations... If nothing is done, it will became desolated and filled with ghost town...  P.S. : There is an adage in France saying : "What Paris means for France : absolutely everything. What should she means ? : infinitely less"
It’s the 7th world power
logical answer/reason : Farm land
In australia (where i live), only 2% of the population lives in landlocked regions while 98% is around the east coast. It’s because it’s very hot but beautiful. We learn about it and there are random spots along the coast like Perth and Adelaide falling into the 98%. I was surprised when the entire Northern Territory was in the 2%. I think you should make a video about it. Also, i’m chinese, and in the 4% in the west many people are going there and meanwhile it has many ethnicities like hui, mongolian, tibetian, uighur and even some manchurian.
Please make a full video on Spain. People have been leaving the countryside in favor of cities for decades now. It's become a huge problem but also created a lot of opportunity. If you're a remote worker or say, a successful YouTuber, who doesn't need to depend on the local economy for income, then rural Spain is a great place to live. I'd be happy to help you make this video.
Boo.  Not a legitimate example.  And most ingenuous.  No country named Palestine exists.
ban condoms in france and spain, just freak
We indians are always happy to help the french and other europeans with demographic issues.
is this really a problem? seems like farmland in the middle of the country is just normal.
Why 1/3rd of France is almost      ?
It is funny when people talk about the wealth of England and France and compare it to that of India. Obviously the wealth of the thief is more the wealth of the victim. But still India was and still is rich. Propaganda wants to project India as a nation of beggars and snake charmers. And France and England as most advanced rich nations. Reality doesn't fit propaganda
I hardly think that areas not taken over by humans qualify as 'empty'. You don't own the planet.
Mom we're on tv!
Make one on the Philippines too, where every provincial road has a house, totally scattered away from the municipal center. You can see houses everywhere away from the basic services like; Water station, grocery store, plaza, parks, clubs etc.
French, British and Spanish Couples  are not in heat anymore, or worse doesn't want to have children.
"nearly indentical in size to india"???
But I could be mistaking, but this part could also be the only island of France-ness. With its culture, atmosphere, and without miggers from Paris of course
Lol “palestine”
Look at USA .. they also have fewer ppl in the middle )
Lozère .. sounds almost like Loser )
l'Hexagones are l'bestagones
*cough* Palestine is neither a state nor any form of valid political entity *cough*
Indentical in size to India🤔🤔
Why does the French military install rear view mirrors in their tanks ?…………………….  So they can see the battle   What do you call 100,000 Frenchmen  with their hands up ?……………    The French army
Nice
Parasites
This is also the rough route of the vandals invasion of Western Europe, in the European migration age.
I don’t think you answered the question
8th best funded military with such a stellar record of surrender.
So, even with Madrid smack dab in the middle, Spain's center diagonal is also abnormally low in population?
Think about all the old towns from the 1600s-1800s that you could find in that abandoned patch , I’m from Canada and find abanodoned culture On the monthly (gas is expensive lol)
RealLifeLore: Why 1/3 of France is almost empty? Me, a Spaniard: laughs in _"La España vaciada"_
Cuz all the bombs
CLICK BAIT...this is an add for an app.  This video is NOT accurate for 2022.  People are moving in the OPPOSITE direction.
Rifle droppers such a great power it was taken in two world wars if the USA did not save them it would part of Germany
French people make love more than any other country.  Let's just face this fact :)
The government is the cause.
englands population density is 400+
That’s because thats where the French people used to live that flys the New French Flag , Its a White Cross on a White background…..   I surrender by Rainbow is the New National Anthem…
Palestine is not a state
Hi pls do a video on a simulation of a nuclear war
France should do a homestead act like us in the USA did
Good god bro, get to the damn point!!!
You clearly havent looked at New Zealand
Laughs in canadian, where 90+% of the population lives within 250 kms of the US border.
Cool video but you take along time to get to the main point...
It's funny because I live in the least populated department of France (Lozère) watching this (:
1:20 same with California
Thanks for this video. I am a graduate of Geography and I usually pride myself on Geographical knowledge, especially of Europe, but this concept of «La diagonale vide» has hitherto completely passed me by. So, looking at the population density map you showed, presumably the 'capital' of «La diagonale vide» would be Clermont-Ferrand, would it, with Châlons-en-Champagne, Troyes and Limoges being the other cities therein?
30 per square km is not that extreme for a third of the country. my whole country, South Africa, has a population density of 42 per square km for the whole country. very large regions the size of European countries of empty space.
I've now found my western Europe vacation road trip vacation route lol (not a city person)
Dude Americans joke about states that run a cow for election because no one lives there.
I do not see how any or this is important. Sure Lozere has a low population but it is a mountainous region. In the USA we have some very large states with even lower population density.
Whats with the "H" pronunciation , sound like mini pause, cant unnotice it 😅
Why do you call the nation of Israel, ‘Palestine’? That is merely the name the Romans under Hadrian gave the land after they put down yet another Jewish rebellion. It comes from the Latin form of the word; ‘Philistine’, in a deliberate reference to the historical enemies of Israel, as an intentional slight.  Up until the early 1960’s, Arab leaders like Yasser Arafat complained bitterly that there was no such people as ‘Palestinians’, but changed their tune when they realised the propaganda advantage of calling themselves by that name. This is not so well known but it’s part of history and you should be aware of it.  You should be more careful with your presentation than this.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Reminds me of that classified Advertisement in the NY Times back in 1946, ON CONSIGNMENT 1M+ FRENCH LEGERE RIFLES LIKE NEW NEVER FIRED DROPPED ONCE
You forgot to mention the Massif Central (where Lozere is located) and that is entirely between the two lines because it is pretty unpenetrable
I was viewing and I saw my birth city at 1:53 !
4:16 didnt help in wars eh?
I’m not sure this video totally explains this diagonal. The question isn’t why this land exists in France, but why it is less populated than the other rural areas in France. Why is this area unpopulated and the rest of rural France more populated?
Fun fact: French birth rates are probably the best on the continent of Europe (not counting the Swedish and Norwegians.)
Macron is a weak leader
India is 6 times larger in size compared  to France. Stop bullshiting
So people choose to work in cities for jobs and on the coast for the Med weather and beaches?
I thoroughly enjoy all demographic and geographic videos you produce, however I have to say, I find it really annoying how you emphasize random words
The answer is so obvious that I don't understand the purpose of the video. I'm French btw, but it doesn't matter. Most countries have a countryside with much less activity, and space is used for agriculture. The economy focalises on coasts and strategic points close to other dynamic countries. Why on earth would there be activity on the center. There is literally nothing to do. It works like this everywhere on the planet. Most humans live on cities, and that proportion still grows. Also, most people live close to coasts. Because of commercial activity, and access to water, and some other factors.  Anyway I've been used to more surprising, interesting content on this channel.  This is nothing close to "strange", it's just geography basics. And why are you comparing a specific zone of a country to the global density of other countries ? It's pretty much apples and oranges.   Even funnier, the way you have to bend your lines to make actual contrast between the different areas. That's pretty manipulative.  Now, let's think about the opposite : It would be so weird to have a country with a very homogenic repartition of population, where people would completely ignore the natural geography and the economic activity, with only small cities of the exact same size. And if you zoom enough, you will always find differences of density. You will always find a way to bend your lines and create some kind of "strange" area.   What is beyond me is that yourself are saying that the phenomenon is global, which is contradictory with the first part of the video. You did everything to present France as a unique situation when it's really not.
France is the country that you use to get to Italy. - female prime minister of UK.
the rural desertification is catastrophic in France, i live in a very poor and empty area, it's very depressing. No young people, no activities whatsoever.... And the city are at the opposite too much crowded.
i’m french
Really enjoy the videos, could you include a topographic model on top of pop density map in the future? if that’s possible thanks
I’m from France in nice pretty dense city tbh
The empty diagonal still sounds a bit crowded for my swedish ears...
As a French, I am so happy that you talked about this topic. It is really a great thing that people from other countries learn about the issues of French rural areas and its History and not just about Paris.
Strangely the most investing thing isn't the subject of the video, which is quite dull, agricultural areas have low population density, big suprise! The interesting part is the reletive decline in French population in the 19th century. Napoleon was clearly an absolute disaster for France, which make the way he is viewed today quite curious.
I was the once a long time .I just know drive he entire country  in a day ,I just know the med is cool on the spinsh side .Since they some cool sandy beaches .And Paris is cool  especially going to the top of the Eiffel Tower .But would jolly old England being the same place ,since  are saying they are dying out .And there parts of the U.K are about the same .
And let's hope it stays like this... As someone who hate living in cities, I'm perfectly fine living in the low density countryside.
Wow, 60 one side 40 the other... wow... it's barely... half and half... wow... wow
- LA DIAGONALE DU VIDE - 🤓👿🤡💀
Can i discover it?
The Ukrainian president calls for demonstrations. This represents a great weakness when facing the Ukrainian army and an escalation of its hold on power, but the opposite is supposed to be the demonstrations to stop the escalation of the West so that there is a solution instead of a comprehensive war that kills all people Peace instead of escalation, and this is the solution, and people should not be deceived by lies that reflect every truth on the ground
One big mexican hat dance around the subject!
Get to the frickin point!
I don't think that uneven distribution of the population is a French specificity.  On this map the diagonal covers a portion of the Bay of Biscay between France and Spain in the southwest; nobody lives on the ocean, that seems pretty logical, doesnt it?
Waste of time, be precise next time!!
I like how you try to keep a French pronunciation on all the cities but then when it comes to Paris you say it like an American lol
really interesting, i live in france and by the way property prices on the coast are always much higher than inland... the current trend for living in the countryside and working from home really is happening, people are moving out of the city in a huge wave especially last year, so you'll see for example normandy and loire region will be increasing in fact any countryside around any major cities the house prices are rising and people are moving outwards if they can mainly to get more space, and cheaper housing, garden etc...
The south part is clearly not landlocked
Please correct size comparison between France and India in your video
The shape of France is more that of a twinkling 'star' than a hexagon. The French think it is hexagon because they were conditioned to think like that. An analogy would be how Chinese 'see' their characters as things that nowhere look like the characters which are based on them.
So here's an idea. Oceans are rising? Maybe if we dug some trenches for artificial salt water rivers we could slow the rising waters and gain that "coast line" advantage in the heartland. Just dig one big river from the ocean towards the center. Just needs to be big enough to promote a fishing trade. If lots of countries did that it could result in an economic boom.
"Demographic shifts from the countryside to the cities is a global phenomenon". Expect this statement to age pretty badly since work from home has started to be embraced after the pandemic. Nobody wants to pay a ridiculously huge rent in a big city when they can actually own a house in the countryside or smaller cities. It will change the world as we know it and it's a good thing, too much centralization was too bad already.
RIP to the French soldiers
see
Empty space because they push refugees and migrants across the channel to little Britainwhich is about to sink below the sea
68 billion people?
Take in all the Ukrainian refugees, since they care so much about  them. Plenty of room!
As time progresses though,  the need of go to the cities diminishes greatly. All the goods can be ordered online and sent to the country. All the entertainment is available on the internet in the country.   If this is understood, then eateries on the country side will become more common and diverse. Smaller towns offer more of those things missing that are exclusivly city centered (athletic opportunities, community centers, venues, etc).  The move towards cities is bad for us all at this point.
It's not a problem.
State of Palestine. Love it!
"The French military is the 8th best funded in the world."  The French military is also the 1st in the world, in terms of speed, to lay down its weapons and wave a white flag...
Population density is not a problem if the reason people live in rural areas is agriculture, and ag is being consolidated and mechanized.  Population decreases ARE a problem.
The French Midwest, lol
Idk man that Spanish diagonal seems a bit invented
In Mexico happens the opposite, more people live in the center than in the coasts
Thank you for showing the French volcanoes !  Funny thing is that the most dense spot of the diagonal is literally next to them
Cause there's no French people there?
It was an eu city until migrants
Like when pop goes down
Not empty.  Not clever. Just expensive.   Not it's "core" either.   But it's wealth.  D'UH
Do a video on Canada please!
France: I'm pretty empty  Russia: HOLD MY SIBERIA
Does Real life lore make videos every Friday?
Fill the void!
the state of Palestine? Where is that? in Narnia?
Is it just me or are there a crazy amount of bots in these comments?
I would very much rather live in the agricultural diagonal than in the gasoline smelling urban centers full of scooters.
Where I live in upstate NewYork, large swaths of the state are shear wilderness. The Adirondack Park alone has an area the size of Connecticut, and it is almost all wilderness. Not rural, not recreational, pristine wilderness. Long before you ever find a forest ranger, you will find bears. And no cell service either. Most of the state is like this. But people think it's all NewYork City.
Avec ou sans la diagonale du vide, VIVE LA FRANCE 🇫🇷
Seems strange to compare w UK.. if you cut the country in half between "the half with London" and "the half without London" wouldn't you have a similar density gap?
This better be good
Seems like a micrososm. Why ppl stopped making babies
I don't really find it that empty except the Gers. I live in Lot-et-Garrone and you have Agen, Villeneuve-sur-lot, Valence, Nerac. Just in my area there are 100,000 people around. Thing is they are dispersed in a ton of villages. So no, it isn't empty. You can literally get lost in any place except the Pyrenees and find a village every kilometer. This department itself is already way more populated per sq mile than most counties in Florida. 5:28 this is true though.
RLL: shows Palestine borders and population  *comments:*
As an Australian, I love reading all the comments from people saying how their country too has a patch with a low population density. Perth, Adelaide and Darwin are separated by a distance between each other of over 2,500 km (or over a 3 hour flight) and there's nothing but desert between them.
Bro I thought the thumbnail was the Elden Ring map that's how addicted I am to that game 💀
England is like this- if you draw a straight line just north of Liverpool going across the country past Manchester and Leeds,and another line cutting off the urban area along the coast by Tyne and Wear and reside, almost no one lives in that big empty area in the north
I just feel like almost every video of his could be shorter by 30% and convey the same amount of information.
We need a video about Spain
You spoke of my world, Lozère. Thanks :)
ENGLAND HAS A POPULATION DENSITY 426 PER SQKM! not 270 as this video said. The UK is 270 but thats because of wales and Scotland. It is so unbearably cramped in England its awful
Until COVID hit! Demographics have changed over time to EMPTY the cities!
Now look at Japan, which is basically 2 cities lol
I thought it was completely empty and no one lived there, I guess it was just the british newspaper saying that.
This really didn't answer anything as it was way too general and didn't specify a cause for France. I don't feel like I gained anything here.
I always thought France looked like a pentagon, why are people saying it looks like a hexagon?....
It's so surprising that France has such massive influence, when they can't even make a car right.
answer is easy, just put in those empty regions and especial economics zones (where business dont pay taxes) and you will see a lot of people , and factories fillling that gap.
why does the narrator pronounce some words with an emphasis that is quite annoying?
and yet they rebuff immigration. I wonder who they think will pay for their retirement
'Almost empty' is clickbait nonsense. The Sahara desert is 'almost empty'.
Took 3 minutes for him to say “This place is empty because…”
Did I just see a picture of Auxerre, my hometown, in an enhlish video ??? That's a weird timeline XD
@7:50: That Spain thing could have been done better..
oh dam, this is a really well made video
Action by Canadian Government Ansley said even if this bill is passed this fall, many Chinese citizens who are alive today could lose their lives before then. This is a frightening reality.   He said involvement in organ trade or organ harvesting is a criminal activity. But right now Canadian citizens can legally go overseas and receive organs on demand, which means that Chinese citizens would be killed to facilitate the organ transplant. The only way for Canada to stop the killing is enforcing a criminal procedure inside Canada.   Mr. Ansley further explained that because there is no judicial independence in China, courts are a low-level government agency operated under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Directed and controlled by the CCP at all levels, the Chinese justice system is not a real legal system. Rather, it is part of the systematic fraudulence by the CCP, with judges playing the role of low-level public employees.
"You think YOUR middle is empty?" -Australia
South Georgia (the U.S. state) is depopulating, too. Certain are growing and the agricultural towns in rural areas are becoming like ghost towns.
lol Canada
So, we can blame Hitler for France being empty in the middle.
68 million people? What an disappointment…
should see the demographics of Australia haha
we have a similar problem here in Greece too.Roughly 1/3 of the population lives in only one city,Athens
So, if the population is lower, is the cost of living lower?
France is beautiful. I love it. But the language hdjdjdjdjdj. eh.
There is no state of Palestine, and never will be.
How to make 11 minutes out of urbanisation and a hexagon……
I always go to a camping in creuse, beautifull lake nearby and we always visit Aubusson a beautifull old frenche city. And its true that only very few people live there, its mostly untouched nature which us beautifull to discover
It is a zone carefully drawn to avoid Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and of course Paris.  Reflects world-wide move to cities
2:40 Soria in Spain IS about twice that Big and It has 80.000 people.
Comment c'est possible de parler de la diagonale du vide sans parler de meme décentralisé
The region of the world Im in has a population density of… 0.69 people per square km. France is just fine.
The point about the split in population density made at 1:18 is completely non-notable.  Many countries (probably most), including the US, the UK, Russia, China, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, and so on, would have *far more than just 60% living on one side of the halfway line.  This isn't making a mountain out of a molehill, it's making a turd out of a fart.
Now do Spain 😅🤣     If you think the diagonal IS empty take a look south... Around 60% of Spain's land  IS bellow 30 people per km²  And yet we have some of the most densely populated cities in Europe and in particular the third largest metropolitan area in the EU.     Just so you get an idea, My region has 800 people/km² and the surrounding ones...25.      There's fears of whole provinces going uninhabited in the near future, while, simultaneously, Barcelona IS getting so crowded It now holds half the top 10 most populated km² in Europe.     Now THAT IS strange 😉
No need to show footage of british troops to explain the french losses in WW1.
Tedious. Pads length by going over too many generalities in a superficial and uninformative manner.
Did I really just waste 11 minutes of my life watching a video tell me painstakingly slowly that the agricultural and landlocked regions of France are less populated? Fucking obviously.
It's astonishing that 20% of France's population lives in Paris, and only 8% live in the countryside. In the UK, only 1 in 8 live in London and over 40% live in the countryside with a large number of people emigrating away from cities. This will soon change as the cost of living in the UK is so high that 25% of the population will live in poverty by 2024.
Is that perhaps ‘wine country’?
This is a non fact video. Virtually every country on the planet has areas where fewer people live. I mean, the opening of ‘east of a line between Le Havre and Marseille is 60% of France’s population’ (representing just a mediocre 10% swing) is hardly earth-shattering news, it’s probably the least interesting fact about France hardly even worthy of being mentioned. Stopped watching after 2 mins, it was cringe-inducing.
Bet its full of life and nature, hope they don't industrialize it
must be a slow news day
you should see Canada
Q: Why is 1/3 of France almost empty?  A: Population is pareto-distributed. A lot of every large country is "almost empty". A third of France, Britain, Germany. Half of India, America, Japan, China. 90% of Russia Canada and Australia.
You should look into Colombia's population density!! The majority of Colombians (a country of 50 million people) live in a small portion of the country leaving like 70% of the country's land basically uninhibited. It's crazy!!!
Proud representative of french empty diagonal here
I am living in that area
He sounded like his balls dropped when he said "L'hexagone"
L'Hexagone sounds expensive.
It's empty because they send all THEIR immigrants to the UK!!
Thanks for mentioning palestine as a state ❤️🇵🇸
2:46  What "State of Palestine"?
Thank you for the video! You have a very interesting channel! And I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, as well as relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet. I also created a channel that can draw attention to this, though so far little has been done ((( I am writing this comment just to wish you health and good mood. Rejoice and connect with a friend. And if you suddenly feel bad at heart, remember this comment Only forward! Looking forward to your next . Good luck!
the "diagonale du vide" the french student nightmare ! Every history or geography classes lead to the "DIAGONALE DU VIDE", please we need help.
I see lots of positives for that "empty" area: cheap housing and land, less crime, lots of room, nature, being able to see the stars, quiet roads, many parking spaces, reduced stress, and a higher quality of life! I'm all for it  🙂
One correction: The place in the Middle East is called Israel not Palestine!
Only 2 thirds left to go
The Legendary "diagonale du vide"
Very interesting, Spanish case is not a line however, but a donut. Everyone lives in the coast except for Madrid. In your graph you have included major regions in the line such as Bilbao and Madrid and excluded many more such as parts of both Castillas
All of the things explained in this video apply to Spain's interior (which has an even lower pop. density) except Madrid because by being the capital it has attracted all of the people around it, like a black hole. Everyone else lives by the coast
france doesnt exist
oh wow some rural areas aren't densely populated. riveting.  what a waste of a 10 minutes.
6:58 yeah bois, we did it, it's home (it's la Chaîne de Puy for the curious out there)
90% of Canadas population lives within 100km of the US border. Everything north of that is virtually uninhabited!
ye and the netherlands is at 430people a sq km...whats your point... many nations...such as france have a massive capital that will screw the distribution....people go live in citys, some nations have then basicly the 1 big city divided over 4 citys but others just have one massive capital....paris being among the most massive of all... its really a wierd setup about litterally nothing, theres also other reasons, the diagonal you point to lies neither on the coast not along borders with other nations, making it less trade valuable, its like pointing to the US and go.... the influence of the US is somehow related to the pop density in Buttfuck south dakota, and ignoring completely that california and new york are absolute economic power houses
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       !!!
when and who calls France a hexagon... i litterally never heard that
as soon as you started your sales pitch for Brilliant, you got a thumbs down
really this again starts of ridiculous as we are used of you guys.... a VOID? .... o ye its not like they grow lavender, wine and other agricultural crops there... nope its an EMPTY VOID ... ffs... and it has JACK shit to do with the overal declining influence of the "west" France among it since the area used to be even LESS populated... not that it matters because you can have a GIAGANTIC empty land like Canada or Russia and it has absolute fuck all to do with your influence level
Woah that's wild
define "empty"
News TNews Flash there is No State of Palestine
That would be Israel.
1:39 How can we trust anything you say when you can't even pronounce Belarus correctly.
This guy still refusing to learn how to pronounce "Belarus"
There is no such thing as the "State of Palestine".  There has never been a state of palestine.  There is the state of Israel.   If your going to do videos about history, get the history right.
France nearly identical in size to India? 🧐 Since when?
That Intro had me laughing out loud 😂 Yes France used to be an important global player but they're basically a 3rd world country by now. I advise you to never set a foot in that shithole, its not worth it.  With much love from Luxembourg ❤
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
France is not a 'great' country in terms of world importance. It's in the middle tier along with a bunch of others. It has pretentions to the top but it's not there anymore. WW1 fixed that.
2:46 Palestine is not a state
Ex-Yugoslavian countries have the worst demography on the planet. Mortality is exceeding fertility for over 10 years now and a lot of young people are migrating to other European countries (brain drain), so the loss of population is really big
“For what does it benefit someone to gain the whole world and yet lose his life?” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭8:36‬ ‭CSB‬‬.
Its empty to leave Space for your mom
The way you said Belarus
nice video
Because it's france. No one wants to live there
That happens in most of countries. For example, the state of Rio de Janeiro has 300 inhabitants per square kilometre and State of Amazonas has 2 inhabitants per square kilometre
““Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands all people everywhere to repent,” ‭‭Acts‬ ‭17:30‬ ‭CSB‬‬..
I always enjoy watching your video. It is so much fun to go on the journey with you. 😊👍
Bruh Reims and Leon are in that line
La diagonale du vide.
I mean, 2/3 or more of the US is way emptier
WW1 had a massive impact on the French population, for reference more French soldier were killed in WW1 than American soldier in all of the US history
I thought France would be richer than India (India is the 4th largest economy)
This does apply to the U.S. as well
I think its extremely good that countries have large empty areas, they should become protected wildlife areas and natural parks!
"State of palestine" it doesn't even exist on the map
I thought it would have something to do with world War 1 battlefields
I am an Indian my states population is larger than France,and gurmany 😆😆😆
You teach geography but still use the term Palestine. it's hilarious.
brb, moving to the vacant center of France, gonna build a cabin on a hill and make wine or something.
Best part of France
Such an interesting analysis :)
Hi, from the diagonal du vide 🇨🇵
The population of france is increasing. All european countries are losing power and influence, relative to the world average, as the rest of the world catches up. The US, whilst still at number one, is also becoming ahead of the pack by a smaller margin.
This video lacked a lot of substance. It was 9 minutes of filler with “people do be living in cities” to conclude
Did not the Ottomans exceed France in population?
I was born and raised in the empty diagonal and spent about 20 years there. For the americans watching, its like the french equivalent of the barren midwest. Everything has such a bleak and depressing vibe to it, its hard to explain. It feels so eerie going through empty villages with abandoned houses and imagine how it used to be full of life back then I moved out to a bigger city and I hope to never return to this wasteland
"4 times less" it's just grammatically wrong. "4 times more" works but if you are talking about a lower number it should be 1/4 or something like that.
*Laughs in Canadian* if only they knew how 85% of the country is uninhabited.
Why are they so gross? I initially never agreed with their stereotype but everyone I met was disgusting. Even the rich kids, I met a few who traveled to California to trim pot, they didn't smoke but apparently thats what rich French people want to do.  During this time the girl had sexual relations with her brother and his best friend.  I bet not everyone follows this stereotype but she even said that its true and that the French are disgusting. Its hard to believe they used to be...the idea of rich and well off
Interesting but pointless
Meanwhile the US as a country has a population density of 36 people per square km. Only slightly higher than this empty zone.
Where can we learn more about the ‘fascinating’ subject of French demographics? Not joking.
As an American..."first time?"
I wonder if Germany has anything to do with it
America didn't divide itself into states
And here I'm sitting in Norway thinking this "low-density" area is widely populated...
I really love your videos but you couldn't be more wrong in 7:45 when talking about Spain. First that "gap zone" enters through the Basque Country, one of the most dense populated areas of Spain. Then it goes over Madrid, where nearly 1 out of 5 spanish lives there.
I live in this diagonal (30 km from the city in 1.54 , Auxerre, 1h30 hours from Paris by train), the main problem is the lack of public services, jobs, transports...
So what was the point made in this video? A country has agricultural land and most people live in cities situated closer to coasts?
This video was just nonsense information tbh
Overstretching content for no reason! Absolutely useless video! 🙈🙈🙈
2/3 of Sweden is totally empty 🙂 +90% lives south of Gävle
Video contains false information. Palestine is a region, not a state.
What is the state of broadband in France? Is there a digital entrepreneur activity that you might find in some smaller cities in the U.S.?
Hi! Jane here. That reminds me of America. I live in the "fly over land", as the Coasters call it, here in Nebraska. I love it. The east and west coast are dense, but here in the middle there is much food production going on.
If you think france seems empty then take a look at argentina.
Can we pronounce Belarus correctly? My stupid brain cries in pain
you should talk about how all canadians live on the border and how much bigger our economy would be if we were more spread out
This video is both interesting, and plainly contradicts itself in several areas.  Better content editing would help here.
2:47 Dear narrator, there is no state of Palestine.  There is only Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel).
Correction:England's population density is 430 per square km, FIFTEEN times greater than not just the middle belt of France but also that of Scotland.
Most countries have this...
So he just refuses to learn how to pronounce Belarus correctly, huh? ;)
There is no state of Palestine. Here is only Israel.
Due to crime. Criminals dominate this area. France is dangerous for tourist.
Ferrghorkk ferrghorkk ferrghorkk ferrghorkkkkkkk
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Some of the mispronunciations here....
Lucky people there. Here in India it's chocking with people everywhere ..... sometimes it gets into your eyes.
*laughs in australian*
Didn't like this explanation. Didn't hold 100km distance from sea, some really high population areas within low zone
The state of what? Palestine is a state? Since when?
Sounds like I need to buy land there.
maybe that's what is called an agropolitan area
5 milion in plestain? where did u took this number? al of israel is less then 10 milion
Palestine isn’t a state
You mean the country Palestine
France used to be a classy artistic aesthetic country now it's an immigrant country. I think the majority are Blacks and Asians. Sweden is on the way to be one too.
👍
This didn't really say all of a lot.
Where is the State of Palestine?
Why do we see "empty" land  as a problem?  Must every square foot of the world be teeming with humanity?
Grateful for being in this empty void 😂 It’s so beautiful here and PEACEFUL
America does not divide itself into states, the several sovereign states have assembled the federal landmass.
All of the things explained in this video apply to Spain's interior (which has an even lower pop. density) except Madrid because by being the capital it has attracted all of the people around it, like a black hole. Everyone else lives by the coast
It's obvious - the invasions in the past came from the West or East, not through the tiny Low Countries, the Pyrenees or the coastline near Spain in the extreme south-west - which you have to go right around Spain to reach (if you are in any major Spanish or Portuguese port). It would make no sense to have many people in the center when you need to defend the borders with large cities (originally forts or citadels). Paris is interestingly located in a way that it provides easy access to both an invasion from the UK or Germany.
This seems like a really pointless video. Almost every country in the world has an uneven distribution of population, with people concentrated around a few major population centres and the coasts, and large areas with relatively low density. There is nothing unique about this at all.
Why is it that you praised Frances historic economic development and influence in the world without mentioning their colonial history and slave exploitation? I know it wasn't the point of the video but it's inextricable from their success on the world stage.
Palestine? 🤔
All they gotta do is put some large factory with thousands of jobs available, and people will come and stay. Like metal manufacturing, recycling facilities, windmill manufacturing etc.
Most populous in Europe by the time of europe what would it be had piere killed a bit less
Next time you should talk about how the world centers are becoming over crowded and the logistics to keeping such a system up is unbelievable complicated and can be prone to bad systems.
France is full of cowards and has been for centuries
Lol now do Canada.
France is home of discrimination and islamaphobia and i wish this diminish will continue until they regret.
X and
Hahaha I literally just went to every corner of L’hexagone in one week. Now I’m seeing this video, whack.
are u a fuking joke xDD
So there’s a rural part of France. I’m really not getting why tf this matters???
Next video: why 3/4 of russia is almost empty
Speak about the North South divide in England
The United States is the same way. Most of the population lives on the east coast almost empty in the mid and mid west and west coast is kinda empty also
The continued existence of rural areas is not an anomaly.
It is a logistics problem, the same can be said about the center of Spain. There needs to be a good logistics connexion between Zaragoza and Toulouse to open up this area that is blocked by the Pyrenees
what country is Palestine?
France is rank 7 strongest on world
And then their is Canada. Literally 90% of our land has not a single person living in them because it is too cold 🥶
Apart from said reasons the diagonal kinda reminds me of the borders of vichy france during WW2. I am pretty convinced this wasn't really helping population density as well..
I really appreciate you not weirdly changing to a French accent mid-sentence every time you say a France-based name, but Belarus is bel-a-ROOS, dude.
You should have a look at the population density map of Spain. The whole country is a void save for like 5 cities, kinda sad 😅
That's specifically European France. But France is also in the Pacific and Indian oceans, yet there's more void in south America.
This is a common issue for most of South American countries. Relatively big countries, enormous and inhospitable geographical features (Amazon forest, Andes mountains, among others) and territorial urbanisation patterns inherited from European colonisation and industrialisation transformations in the XXth century (causing that some countries concentrates up to 40% of the national population in just one city) provoke that most part of the countries areas are essentially empty.
urbanization?
So, in short, this is in way specific to France.  The central area of Australia has, literally, almost noone living in it. Similarly true if you include inland farming areas.  I reckon I could find 1/3 of the US with only a small fraction of the population.  That aside, why on earth would anyone consider de-population as a problem.  The entire range of climate and environmental problems so many consider to be dire and 'existential' are due to *increased* population.   The planet would be *much* better off with only half the number of inhabitants (or fewer)
Well, 1/4 of Turkey lives in Istanbul.
S/o la diagonale du vide
Would love to live in a rural village somewhere in France fixing up an old farmhouse!   Let us know when France starts giving away farm houses for a Euro like Italy does.
7:32 idk if it just me or not But my idiot brain think that french purposely left those area   Because they wanna let german move through them easily  You know why right **cough** blitzkrieg **cough** ver 2.3
Because no one wants to live there
And yet they still dump all their economic migrants over the channel on us Brits... Shameful.
You've gotten long-winded my friend. Get to the point. The first five minutes felt like fifteen
I see what you did there; “do be living in cities”
Are there designated Dark Sky Parks within this diagonal?
I live in Western Australia where the population density is less than 1 person per square kilometre, so 30 people per square km sounds PACKED to me.  We could literally give every single one of our citizens a square kilometre of land each and still have some left over. Western Australia is stupidly big.
India is over 2 million square miles while France is only a little over 200,000….. hardly “nearly identical in size”. Due to the Mercator projection, India looks much smaller on the map….
All the national parks are here that’s why…simple
australia: hold my beer
Boy u talk too much and say to little
You butchered the french accent so much I can smell meat.
It makes sense remember a humans tend to congregate closer to water the closer inland you go less people there are.
Geef gewoon antwoord in plaats van 10 minuten rekken, ik heb weggeklikt! Anders kan er geen ad tussendoor he? Daarom dat vollullen!
So it is basically urbanisation Why did that take 10 minutes again?
Russia: "Empty? You call THAT empty?"
This video takes too long to get to the point.
i mean... couldn't you draw a shape of the least populated part in each country and say 'wow, it's less populated there!'
The global warming narrative is very hard to take seriously when every country is still pursuing rapid population growth and economic expansion. Really you can only pick one. Humans produce carbon, regardless of where their energy comes from.
More land for agriculture, the wildlife, industry, national parks, military bases, or even a new city. France, you've got to get your population up if you want the last option.
What an excuse, France doesn't exist.
Is this the guy from solid verbal podcast?
rll: publish a video about [country]'s geographical issues people from [country]: learnt about that in geography lessons people from USA if [country] is usa: these issues existed?
Man all they need is an electoral college and that 10% could have majority of political power because they have more grass.
The "state" of Palestine? Cmon man you know better than that
Germany has a lot of emptiness too, but it is the coast, that is empty. Also the east. And where there is east & coast are the states that everyone forgets about, because almost no one lives there. Which are Brandenburg & Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, both massive in land mass, but completely empty. The capital of brandenburg being basically an extension of Berlin.
7:48  Reallifelore: expands the line to Spain The line: includes Madrid, the most populated city of Spain.
this is my prediction of this video. He is going to talk about frances over seas territories like french Guiana and their uninhabited islands.
I really appreciate you saying Palestine and not Israel
In Australia, no one lives in outback😅😅😅
On aime la tranquillité depuis toujours et on veux pas d'immeuble chez nous c'est simple
2:24 France is politically divided into 13 regions. Not 18.
This is basicly Sweden also. 70% of Sweden's population lives within 50km of the sea, and 50% within 10km of the sea.  But then again... We have 3200 km of coastline
French people, who knows?
I don't understand what's so weird about this, almost every country in Europe and elsewhere has high density spots and low ones. And it's not unusual that the low density areas are landlocked and somewhere in the middle. It's the case for Spain, Sweden, Finland, USA, Brazil, etc. Actually countries with evenly distributed population are the exception not the rule.
It seems quite logical, consider the options people in France have, both historically and currently, you'd pick harbor towns. So they have access to the sea in north and south, thus a less populated diagonal seem logical. But comparing that line to similar sized areas in Europe displays that there is no great disparity.
I ate the French population there. Sorry about that.
I feel like you exaggerate too much in these videos, it draws the length out to unreasonable amounts and more so makes the video seem misleading even if they're not
How is this an anamoly? You can find "empty" areas in Australia, Canada, and probably most US states. It is hardly unusual.
I recognized the diagonal from Tour de France routes. Seems like a lot of the mountain stages take place within the diagonal.
That part on France looks like a fine place for Finnish people
That’s nothing compared to Australia or Africa
Meanwhile Poland: *people move from cities to countryside*
palestine is not a state
30% of China Houses a billion people
I thought you were going to mention Zone Rogue, where WWI made the region uninhabitable
this situation just snowballed
What’s the benefit of such information?
“The diagonal continues to spain” *proceeds to show the diagonal going through Madrid*
Well keep leeching our military
Lost most thinking people when you referred to a mythological "state" as if it were real.
A thing like social media also keeps people "in the want" to never lose track of what there is out there. Less likely to settle, more likely to pursue - even if what is pursued is only going to happen for one in a thousand. It's basically "SQUIRREL!" on a national level.
Anything French is so annoying
Bro I literally guessed all the reasons at the start of the video lol
Next should be why Canada is 90% wilderness lol
France is not one of the worlds most significant countries. lol.
In india 90% of the people occupy just 10% of its total land, its not from some official data or something, you could just zoom into indian map and see how strange the population distribution is, its kinda even for all india, but extremely uneven on small scales, you'll see most of the land is either empty or farmlands, while people live in tiny cluster of houses. And beleive me, it doesn't feel congested at all, except for a few major cities. In my own city of 3 million people, nearly 2million live in less than 300sq km, out of total 3k sq km.... and I've never felt it to be overcrowded, it feels just right.
Countryside>>>>megacities
And then you've got me who lives in the diagonal...
The continuation of the low population density line into Spain really is quite arbitrary. For one, it includes Madrid, Spains capital and largest urban conglomeration.
Plenty of space there for the boat people
7:47 But Madrid has ALOT of people!
That’s void is probably historically  i.e. wine regions that are likely still protected as such by the people and their gov representatives of wine country regions . Idk just a wild guess lol
Because god hates france xD
"from one land-locked end of the country to another by the Pyrenees" ... the bit in the south being right by the coast. the bit that's not land-locked  edit- punctuation
Europe is sterilizing itself into oblivion.
France suffered due to WWI WWII  Russia more so and continues to suffer due to language, politics and dictator.  BE IN NO DOUBT, the greatest geopolitical challenge of the next century is the decline of Russia, with China buying, acquiring or invading Russia.
Yawn zzzzzzzz
thank you for not being afraid of mentioning Palestine!
I'd read more French history if it weren't so damn hard to pronounce their pronouns
That line in spain spans into the lowest population density in Portugal: Baixo Alentejo.
You drew a line down the middle and thought it was weird that there was a 60/40 split? With Paris on one side the only thing surprising about that split is how equal it is. By contrast you can draw a line down the middle of china diagonally and 96% of the population will be on one half.
This is very interesting
Dou you think this has a low population? Look for "spanish lapland".
This topic about the silent parts of France reminds me of Mr Bean's Holiday. I noticed as he go south of France, the surroundings were all countrysides and a few towns until he reached Cannes.
Don’t give Germany any ideas
Very educational video i love it
France:  we have a large area with a low population. USA:  hold my beer.
"Mistery", yeah right. Dragged it for a pointless 10 minutes just to address right at the end what you could have said in 30 seconds.
Exactly same video as Nebula. Why pay when you can watch it for free? Will write to Nebula.
As we see the world ramping up towards a one world order; we can see every revelation of the bible is coming true before us.. The good news is their is still time. Accept Jesus as your savior now. He died for all your sins (past present and future) all you do is believe in him alone and you are justified in the eyes of God
Pyrenees Atlantiques is not empty, there are over 600k people living there
At least it's not like in the US, where the empty regions have a god given right to decide who becomes president - because god forbid the population centers where the wealth of the country is generated get any say in this.
info barf
My god. Please do more of these vids. This video was amazing.
Summary: Less people live way from coast lines and in agriculture areas. There, I saved you 10+ minutes of your life.
Did you just say France is identical in size to India? France is almost 1/7th the size of India
Hexagon, huh? I think it looks more like a star
Love the reference to Palestine!
The women of Spain are too beautiful for them to have low birth rates.
This entire hypothesis is simply dumb. Every country in the world has regions with low density, so this lesson is like a headline proclaiming New York City is larger than Boise, Idaho. Not really newsworthy.
Can we accomodate Ukrainians there? Those people are fleeing their country
but who is in paris?
Yeah i am french and from Lozere so funny to see a youtube channel as big as this one talking about my wild but my beautiful region ^^ Agace aun pawe al video a  2:45 ;)
Australians be like … you call That empty???? Hold my 🍺
video idea: why the nordic countries aren't that populated.  like for instance that on 59% of swedens area only 12% of the people live on? and the fact that less than 30 million people in total live in the whole of nordic?
For most of the history of the US there has been some sort of war or conflict going on. Yet the French lost more people in the four years of WWI than the US has lost in all of its wars. It's absolutely devastating to imagine.
first world war was part of the depopulation plan. Urbanisation is the beginning of smart cities where the government control everything. Once you see it you can't unsee it.
It is an irony that you also made French geography is perfect video, can you make video on what is prefect population density for a country
Reason: You can't grow food very efficiently on roofs.
Why are there so many Bots that are repeating what people say?
It's not an anomaly! You can paint lines on many maps and find unusual patterns. It doesn't make them anomalies!!!!
I personally think there is some overthinking going on when trying to explain why some cities snowball and others don't that leads to overlooking a more mundane initial catalyst. The simple fact is we humans go way beyond merely herd like strength in numbers, it is way beyond that sort of simplistic hang out with 100 people rather than 10 means you are ten times less likely to be the one eaten if a lion attacks. With our species the benefits of joining the larger groups is more exponential than linear, being easily able to learn and use enough vocabulary to communicate pretty much any arbitrary concept let us co-ordinate to such a degree that adding to the pool tends to make existing members more productive too. More minds yields more ideas, sure this includes more bad ideas but the useful ones tend to spread better so especially before the internet became essentially ubiquitous allowing near instantaneous communication to any pretty much human on earth at any time having more people close enough to physically go and talk to them led to an exponential growth in productivity and prosperity. So yeah be bigger early prior to modern communications and it would inevitably tend to snowball exponentially from there (Assuming no external limiting factors eg too far from essential resources etc).
Spain needs its own video. Its very low and uneven population density is a really troubling and fascinating phenomenon. It's kinda like the empty diagonal of France, but actually much more severe and with its own particular causes. It would be a great opportunity to expand on this topic.
LOSER!!!  LoL and ya wonder why 😛 Might be a time to rename.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Yeah... looking at the actual population density map, this "anomaly" is completely arbitrary lmao
I appreciate you highlighting just England not all of Great Britain 🙏
*France isn't the 7th best economy! It's sole existence is based on Americans saving them, and them being allowed to steal from Africa!!!!*
The kingdom of the Lord is at hand humble yourselves, renounce the sin that clings so closely & repent and believe in the name of  yeshua for the remission of your sins christ died for us so live for him. even if you don’t believe give him a try no matter what he will accept you even if you’ve never believed since birth.. confess with your mouth and believe with your heart truly believe and you shall be save it takes nothing but faith Trust Me you will feel him id rather die believing and there not be life after then there be life after and not believing Jesus knew he would be the most hated but despite that still gave up his life for us believe in that and ye shall be saved. the blood of Jesus poured for our sins so you don’t have to go to hell. God can work wonders if you let him just a little of your time
Noticed an error where he says France is almost identical to the size of India. France is only roughly 1/6th the size of India.  Metropolitan France is 213,011 sq mi  India is 1,269,219 sq mi
Man send Biharis and Bhaiyas there 😀 …
Pity about the basic errors in English. Doesn’t know when to use “fewer” rather than “less”..
France is actually only the 4th most populous in Europe, behind the Russia, Germany and the UK
bad video (once again)
Void diagonal
tl;dr Cities everywhere tend to be by the oceans, while midlands get used for agriculture.
Au revoir Shoshana!
There is no “state of Palestine.”  I’m not watching your propaganda anymore.
china be like
No wonder why EU is complaining about the diminishing population. Has a sufficient sum of land that can be utilized but no one to live in them.
You're right, let's take more immigrants!
0:13 France is nowhere near as big as India
Australian here laughing at commenters that think they have large rural city divides in their country.
"Nearly identical in size to India..." RLL again with a well-researched content ☠️
"State of Palestine" - No such thing exists. Several countries have recognized such a state, but it has no well-defined territory, no actual authority beyond the Oslo accords grants, and its national assembly does not regularly convene. Transnistria is more of a country than this.
Haven't you hear about a country called: China - where nearly all (actually 96%) people would on the eastern half Egypt - 95% lives on the bank of the Nile, Anyway back to Europe, I guess Spain's population distribution concern is greater
Almost every country with a large land area has vast sways of low density land. I’m not sure that I see a problem. People in the countryside have always generally had more children and then many moves to the cities. If you look at the birthdate in rural areas I’m sure it will be much higher than dense cities
4:08 "In fact, at the time of Napoleon, France was the 4th most populous country in the entire world, lagging behind only China, India, and Japan. Such a huge population compared to all of her neighbors helps to explain France's dominance in European affairs throughout the Medieval, Renaissance, and early Industrial periods."  ...those 3 countries with larger populations had much less influence than France. Perhaps you could consider China and India regions, and then consider their population centers' influence on the rest of the folks there, but, still, what? If you're going to make an argument, and contradict it in the same sentence, I'm going to think you didn't think it through. Which is unfortunate, I used to like it here.
Okay now do the US
Isn’t that the part of France where the smelly cheeses come from… 😏
Look at the land bordering the water.  Invaders run out of steam with french surrendering soldiers. Theres only so many you can take.   Seriously its similar distance from sea and ocean shorelines on both coasts.
I see that shape as a pregnant woman, try to look at it again?
Who has been watching rll for years.
Sparrows in Europe have a left AND a right leg! Sparrows in Africa? Well, they are just normal, with two legs.
"Almost empty"? . . . it seems to me this is where a lot of food production takes place. . .
Why is this a problem?   I love your videos usually but an entire video that's basically "woah population density exists!!!" is kinda pointless.
me living in Australia: wait those numbers were small?
This video is factual, but the narrative is misleading there are plenty of Other country’s in Europe with swathes of land that are not densely populated. Quite frankly this isn’t that remarkable
Hopefully Le Pen wins the election. France needs a revival
Did anyone else notice a lot of weird sentence structures and grammatical errors in this one? He must have gotten a new writer or something
Urbanization is truly global. Here in the United States, I saw a statistic once that 99% of all job and population growth from either 2000 to 2010 or 2010 to 2020 in the United States was in urban areas.
India is about 5 times larger in size than France.
Denmark recently passed laws to decentralize public institutions, moving public offices out in the countryside. I wonder if it's gonna have any effect.
I have a dream, that someday RLL will pronounce "Belarus" correctly.
It’s happening in Ireland too, I’d say it’s a world wide problem
2:43 and Americans make fun of Wyoming.
I just remembered why I unsubscribed to this channel.  Never before has so little information been conveyed in 11 minutes.
it's mainly due to farmlands, and a low national population density, WW2 virtually took out half of france's population that is still recovering to this day
hardly strange to find large countries with areas of low population density.  try Australia.
I've done several bicycle trips through the diagonal you describe--and believe me, it's far from empty.
There is no "State of Palestine."
The worst part about living in low-density areas for young people... Finding a date. You want to find someone locally but have to compete with people in the city - who don't imagine moving back out to rural areas. Flying around the world to meet a foreign prospect is much easier than finding a local date.  I mean, it might sound crazy, but it's legit harder to convince someone in the city that 60 kilometers isn't "long distance" than it is to just fly 6000 kilometers to meet a cute person in South America or East Asia.
This seems to be a common theme in many countries, densely populated coasts with the agriculture pushed to the low value land in the middle.
it doesn't take a genius to figure out if you want people to live in a certain area you eliminate taxes in that area. its not brain surgery.
Pro tip: southern France is way more chill than northern France.  Paris has a reputation for being hostile to tourists but go to Marseilles and everyone is friendly.
Bro said Palestine as if it’s a real country 💀
Look at how close that bulge of low population gets to the south east coast on the Mediterranean! Looks fantastic. Easy car ride to some very beautiful places.
Me as an Australian, where 90% of the country is basically empty: haha empty Frog land
Crazy to see how empty France still is considering the amount of people from Africa, Caribbean, Middle East, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Poland, and etc have been moving there in last 100 years.
Ah, shit!! Really? Just a hook for some spam to sell your sponsor. Disgusting and deceptive really.
Honestly, it sounds like a great place to live.
Mongolian is the ultimate Empty place in the world
The emptier the Fr*nce; the better.
Disliked when palestine was called a state
Keep it less populated, I like nature
RLL just flexing his French or duolingo bird will be mad
The content on this one is pretty sketchy. The causes given for France's relative decline in population over the centuries isn't convincing. In 1693, it's estimated that over one million French starved to death thanks to famine, in one year. Yet the population bounced back, as it did not do after Napoleon and WWI. France, unlike Germany and Russia, did not suffer a substantial population loss in WWII. If the thinness of the population density in this central strip is mostly due to distance from a coastline, why is Germany, which has little coast, so much more heavily populated than France? Causal explanation here was lacking.
The entire Western population is crashing. The Age of men is ending , the orcs are taking over
you really dragged out this topic didnt you..
Long live occitania
france density map made me uncomfortable you know why
It's kinda fun how you talk about "empty line" in France and Spain, while here in Russia, particular in Siberia, we say "living line", which following Trans-Siberian railroad. And i don't be surprised if pop per kilometre in this living line actually will be lower that in empty diagonal.
Every country has empty zones. The US is barren in the middle except for a few major cities and hillbillies. China is empty on its west. Russia has dense cities dotting a barren cold wasteland. Spain has a dense core, empty filling and dense crust. England is barren on the north. Mexico is mostly empty on the north and south. Australia is crust only. India has higher population in the north and south and sometimes along the coast.
Your "empty void" includes many of the wilder lands, the Massif Central, and many wine and agricultural regions. As France has almost ZERO true wilderness by the standard definition (areas of land more than 5km from roads or built structures) it is a bit of a fallacy to call it an empty void. BTW, there are some pretty major cities in that region that you may have missed (or artfully avoided) - Lyon, Bordeaux and Toulouse to name three.  You want to see some population density extremes? Take a look at Australia. 30 people per sq km here is actually not too bad; a fairly moderate density. My state of Victoria has that density overall, and it too is just over 1/3 the area of France. But again there are some VERY good reasons for the "fringe-dweller" nature of our population.
Isn’t that the same for the us, most people on the US live near the borders/ coastlines
Your ad transitions are Brilliant.
Where exactly is Palestine? I can't find it on any map
You promised it would be fascinating. You lied.  Or maybe it was fascinating until you presented it and had to say every statement 5 times.  For those who don't want to watch 11 minutes of this video, the answer is fewer people live farther away from the coast.
fun fact, more than a half of Mongolian population lives in a capital city Ulaanbaatar , despite we are 19th largest country
As a dude from West Virginia I feel singled out 😂
oooh, bases across the planet. so cool, so legal, Thats what all these republics should do, military bases, bases, bases across the planet.
the least populated city is called "lozer" lmao
Just settle moroccan and algerian migrants in the zone they have higher babies and the zone will prosper or just let the area die out🤷‍♂️
It’s like upper peninsula Michigan
Damn should i move there? Im over traffic here in socal
RRL is foundation personal who’s trying to cover up the fact that an SCP deleted 1/3 of France
they're avoiding Spain 🤢
this guy really still can't pronounce belarus--
Ive driven through this part and I already know the answer is sunflowers...ive never seen so many huge fields full of sunflowers before! I guess its their equivalent to our corn and soybean fields in the rural midwest.
That's just called rural.  And its dense by some other place's standards.
People actually do be living in cities
Lets goooo Rll is on trending!!!
Is the same thing with the USA.  USA's population is concentrated in California and between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean.  The center of the USA, and the places between Texas and Califormia are just empty.
France is full of colonizers
We're overpopulating the whole damn planet.
Well done video on an unremarkable topic... As you can see from the comments, plenty of countries have disparities in population density that you can draw arbitrary lines between urban vs rural areas. Meh.
Plenty of countries in the world have this going on, channel must be running out of ideas lmao
Me living in a country thats density is about 1015 per sqkm (Bangladesh)
I'm french and im in this diagonal and tbh it's a good thing that some places don't have that much people if you are introvert, love fields, nature and seek low cost, Maybe you will buy a cheap house and it will be a city in the future, the only thing upsetting is internet connection xdd Great video
The "state" of Palestine, you mean East Israel?
Then this begs the question, is there a way to stop the demographic growth of cities and promote the growth of rural areas.
The depopulated diagonal continues in Spain…. Madrid: Am I a joke to you?
It feels so weird to see a RLL video without him mentioning a sponsor at the intro.
Don’t tell the English!
I thought I was going to learn something today but all I found out was that France has rural areas or in other words the middle of France is the “country” part.  It would literally be the same as asking why so little people live in the middle of America compared to the coasts.
State of Palestine, Nation of Israel.  As long as it's identified as a Jewish State in Civilization. ✓
0:11 France is nowhere near the size of India, India is actually about 6 times bigger than France 🤦‍♂️
simple solution: foreign immigrants
Palestine doesn't exist
I wish I had Brilliant growing up and struggling with math in high school.
But, what about the United States? I don’t even think a single person lives in South Dakota.
About the size of Belarus cuz everyone knows the size of Belarus
It’s cus fuck that place
You compared a region of France to the size of the state of Palestine. There is no state of Palestine. Palestine was a name given to the land of Israel by the roman emperor Hadrian to insult the Jews and name their land after their enemy the Philistines. There has never been a Palestinian state that was usurped by the Jews. The Palestinian narrative is repeated lies started by Arafat who himself was an Egyptian.
The puffy south africa tribally remain because plywood astonishingly bounce among a abounding t-shirt. caring, giant russian
Good video but please learn the pronunciation of Belarus. Throws me off every time it’s mentioned in videos
Interesting. I wonder how much of a change is also because of the Great Plague of the 1340s and 1350s. I read somewhere that the population density of parts of Southern France didn't recover for centuries and some parts might even now have smaller populations than back then although that seems pretty dubious to me if it was only due to the Plague. However, if some of those parts are in that diagonal, perhaps they did finally recover by, say, 1800 but then went back down again.
2:56 90000 - 76000 = 24000? hmmmmmm
Maybe people live rather closer to the coast.
French government should buy the land that is deffinetly owned in that area and sell it cheap to people willing to farm it.
Huh?  A pentagon would fit over the map much better than a hexagon.  I can't even see a 6th side.
I studied french in school, starting in 1st grade.  I have never in my life heard France referred to as "le hexagon".
Thats a small size (L'ozare) in length and its typical through out Europe in an area like that to have that number of population...for example my country Macedonia, or Serbia, or Bulgaria...you have many municipalities like that amount of people and that big....they are called  municipalities or region,..but i think everywhere they are divided now like municipalities.
Palestine is not a state.
I grew up in a little town called magnac-laval in France and can confirm the real reason the area is empty is there's nothing to do and it's boring as hell
I have never heard of France being called a hexagon. That's interesting. I always compared it to a star. ⭐
as a spanish i have to say that the diagonal shown in the map of Spain doesnt really fit with the real distribution of population, for example it includes basque country and Madrid which are very highly populated, and leaves out most part of both Castillas and Extremadura, the lowest populated places in Spain  for the rest very interesting video👍
7:23 my whole country is within 100km of a coastline
Yeah in France we call it "diagonale du vide" translate to "emptiness' diagonal". But in geography we prefer "diagonale des faibles densités" translate to "low densities' diagonal", it's less scary and more accurate of the situation.
8:20 % of population would have been more illustrative along with the hard numbers.
In the Iberean Peninsula the case is even worse. Half of Portugal has no people and basicaly all of Spain's population is in the coast and Madrid
Haven't watched the video yet however, let me make a prediction: The Ubisoft studios exist in those regions
France is shaped like a starfish...L'starfish
Absolutely great vid. However agriculture has thinned population growth for decades worldwide.  Humans have almost destroyed the planet with breeding too many. World population decline is positive.
I will take the diagonal, please.
Makes me want to eat my slice of bread with a shit ton of butter on it to celebrate all the cows living and the crops being grown in the empty diagonal
The answer is the build beautiful homes / and a train to lead into cities so people have jobs. They can hop
In spain this happens too, some parts of the center of the country are empty, basically all around Madrid is empty
By landmass Canada may be the 2nd or 3rd largest country but check out the Northwest territories or Nunavut or the Yukon territories
This is not a bad thing, let there be rich soil and rural areas
Canada is also very similar. The vast majority live only a few km from the US border in only a few key cities. This centralization has pushed housing costs up dramatically as there are too many people concentrated in only a handful of areas. The core reason for this is due to the lack of jobs in rural areas.
It’s empty because this would correspond with the white part of the French flag, the one art where everyone surrendered on trying to live there
WHY DONT YOU DO A VIDEO ABOUT THE SATANIC PEDOPHILE RINGS
French being a significant country? Mehhh I don't know about that. Maybe 200 years ago
If France has been a power for centuries why was France defeated by Germany in about 2 weeks.
How much money could I make off of an American style ranch in Europe
Quarter Pounder
As a Canadian, I wonder if our more dene regions are even close to the density of rural France. sure, our cities can be somewhat dense, not too dense really, but even southern Ontario is likely less dense then France's empty region! Canada is the size of Europe (the whole continent, not just EU member states) while our population is just over half of France's population! I am not complaining though, I love it here!
Cool, more weasely, misleading clickbait on youtube...
I mean, you can take a giant vertical chunk out of the US between roughly the right edge of California and the midpoint of Texas and call that the Great American Void.  The population density in most spots there is itty bitty compared to the East, California, or the coast.  But that's not especially surprising given the geography and history of the US.  The vertical slice including Nevada, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and friends is largely arid or dry desert.  The low-density farming of America's Bread Basket naturally means less population density.  The area is far away from coasts and there's not as many major rivers (nothing quite like the Mississippi).  Nobody wants to live in the Dakotas for reasons we all agree on but cannot openly discuss (this is a joke please don't jump on me).  And the east was colonized first and is Europe-facing for an early advantage to trade, the west coast was populated because it's a coast and also gold rush and so on, while the center had and has less somewhat less gravity pulling people to it.  Etc.  Just because there's a less people in a band of a country doesn't mean it's all that surprising.  But an HAI or RealLifeLore video on this or on Spain would be interesting all the same!
"state of Palestine"? Where TF is that?!?
VIVE LA FRONCE
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~🎈
2:45 bad choice calling Palestine a "state"
I don't really see the problem with this. So what if everyone wants to live in Paris, and leave a nice peaceful country side?
Please do Austalia's population situation please it's my favorite thing to laugh at and hear about. I would love to learn more about it.
I would wager you can create an arbitrary 'depopulated strip' through any country.
I love France I have been to Paris and it’s beautiful  And the food omg
Real life lore recognizes Palestine 2:50 Mashallah
8th best funded military in the world? Haha, still useless and 0 help against russia. French President can only talk, and do 0 action
Nice👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
im surprised that its 15 in trending canada
I thought when he mentioned the military he was about to drop a bomb of a joke.
FRANCE IS NOT THE SIZE OF INDIA!!! It's about 6 times smaller!!!
THE EUROS NEED GLASSES FRANCE LOOKS LIKE A PENTAGON TO ME.............
I think the reason for this diagonal is very obvious. The French wanted to create a corridor for the Germans to travel through when they inevitably invade the country from Belgium again. This empty area will let the Germans quickly move into Spain leaving the important parts of France unscathed, genius really.
I would straight up pay an entire other bill every month to get rid of this truebill crap
ok so you couldve summerized it to one word: agriculture what a waste of time
Bc half of the country is near Paris? 🤷🏼🤣🤣
7:45 wtf you literally caught the basque country and madrid which are two of the most densely populated areas of Spain
Laughs in Norwegian🤣👍
What about Toulouse
It's not an anomaly
07:54 Don’t blame people for not wanting to live in the ocean
As a Canadian I'm like wow only a third of the country is empty?
fr*nch people 🤮
Marseille, Lyon, Lille are correct But then you had to close it up with Paris pronounced in English, that cracked me up lmao
I LIVE THERE! I’m going to move to Paris soon.
And the least densely populated area in France is the Amazon rainforest.
UK: English channel. 🙅🏻‍♂ Portugal, France, Spain: La Manche. 👏🏻
What’s the state of Palestine ?
They surrender to the empty space
Part of the problem in the area bordering Belgium is the continuing threat to habitability posed by tainted soil and unexploded ordinance leftover from when the area was the Western Front in WWI. The Zone Rouge continues to see hundreds of tons of ordinance found and removed every year, and soil samples in some areas have arsenic levels as high as 175 GRAMS per kilogram. Human habitation in some areas is entirely forbidden by law, and restrictions apply in much of the area.
How does corsica fit in this?
I was always wondering why like half of France seemed empty lol
US and NATO: "alright boys you know the drill" France: "I'm f*cked up"
It's fascinating that's this is true in a lot of countries.  Indonesia, for example, has a pretty good chunk of its population in the island of Java.  Indonesia is a HUGE country but has large swaths of its land area void of any meaningful population density. East Papua and Borneo are HUGE regions but aren't populated that much at all.
"The 'Empty Diagonal' expands it's width into Spain..." Madrid, Spanish capital, pop. c. 5,000,000: "Hell~OOO! Am I a *joke* to you.?!"
Ye but why did their birth rate drop in the 19th century? That would be interesting to explore
Is it just me or is this the first time I’ve heard of the French having an army in the 2000s?
Now I know where not to nuke
Basque country is not sparsely populated in sw france, take in mind parts of france speak  celtic, basque, italian, flemish, german, catalan, and occitan languages.
What's with the yelling?  The audio on these is like the most annoying of TV commercials.
As an American, I'm actually chuckling at this. You think 30 people per square kilometer is almost empty? That's pretty crowded compared to some of our states. Alaska, the biggest state by area but one of the least populated, has a population density of half a person per square kilometer. No, that's not a joke.
I've lived worked and travelled there but never seen an empty space for miles so it's not that quiet
in class we call this "la diagonale de faible densité" :)
delete that crap
Love how you call Palestine a state 💯
Im from lozère and it's ok :D
France has nothing on the scale of population density differences that Australia has, 86% of Australia's population lives in cities, and much of the remaining population lives in towns in between the cities
Palestine is not and never has been a State.
I live in the diagonale. A lot of this is because these are where the more rural areas are, and where the less settle. As many may know, France has high quality soil, the best in Europe. Many of these rivers take root in the diagonal. So putting these variables together, rivers and farms, the population density would obviously be lower.
Marssegh, Leeyough, Leeyugh, and Peariss.
I want to know about the diagonal as it expands throughout all of Europe.
Hi
Canada: That's it?
State of Palestine ? No such thing..
People do be living in cities
Two things: this is a very interesting video about france that i did not know.  Two:...  Notice how nonchalant he talks about French's global military bases and French own importance... Compare with how he talks about a certain other nation's foreign military bases.... Its as if he approves of one, but not the other.
He didn't say a word about the millions of boat people from the Middle East and Africa that affects demographics.
Hi ‘Palestine’? I think you mean ISRAEL! ( since 1948)Shalom to us only in Christ Yeshua
At 7:11, it bothered me how he called the SW end a 'land locked end by its border with spain' when it's literally open to the Atlantic. And while he acknowledges not every coastal area in France is not highly populated, it's still a logically unsound sentence. lol
Don’t show that map to the Africans.
You can just say the population of France surrendered  lol
Very interesting, but can you get to the poinr much quicker, please? Your intro is like 4 minutes
Why did you pixilate galicia
2:52 Not that comfortably because England fans….
I don't understand what is so unique about this. Rural places are rural? An economy that has shifted towards services and away from farming has encouraged moves towards economic centres?  It would be more interesting to show me a country that doesn't have a rural less populated area, that isn't becoming less populated and an aging population.
this is the region of france that interests me the most
Still bamboozled by the fact that you can compare France and India's economy. (And yes, I'm aware of India's substantial growth)
massif Central
I come from England  , i want to drive around  france in a nice car Edit: England is really ppl dense. Wow i had no idea france had even nore population than Russia and was 4th in the world Edit:its good that theres a that space in franc to grow food for western Europe
But.. why is this population trend considered to be problematic?
Can someone give me the short version to Why 1/3rd of France is Almost Empty because i fell asleep
France is basically a city-state, everything in centerred around Paris
5:40 I like how he switches his accent just to say those cities except for Paris
Well, at least in France, people know where to go if whenever they do get tired of dat bustlin city life......😉😂🤣
Ah the Wyoming of France
Do you think Justin Bieber sprays his DNA all over the ladies while he's at Paree France
"state of palestine" so based
How are you finding ideas to make these kinds of videos?!
Shoot. America has been that way since the late 1800's. It's like everyone skipped over the Midwest and Intermontane West, and headed straight for the West Coast. It's why you've got East of the Mississippi (generally), then the West Coast, with "flyover country" in between. Just look at Wyoming. More people in a suburb of LA, than the entire state of Wyoming. (I exaggerate, but not by much.) Seriously though, vast open areas, and I like it. Thinking about moving out West, to the Southern Front Range of Colorado, and enjoying the lack of people. Nothing but Plains to the East, and the Rockies to the West!
He said nearly identical in size to India? 😱
And then half of algeria came and france was lost.
Why too much talk?
My family who lives there: 👁👄👁
they're creating a buffer in case germany tried to attack again so they have times to create white flags
I'm certain plenty of people in 'Palestine' would be happy to fill the sparse middle
meanwhile the USA:
Palestine isn’t a state…
The increase towards atheism helped drop the birth rate also.
You can say the same for USA, Most of the population of USA is near the west coast and east coast. In the middle, it's just a no man's land with only agricultural industry and small village
Damn if you think France is empty you should see Spain lol
Hmm, time for the Tim Traveler to go there.
The birth rate started back up thanks to millions from North Africa and the Middle East.
I can't believe anyone would see having areas with beautiful land and less people as an issue, especially with today's world population
Sounds like a place I’d love to live in. I’m so sick of city life and crappy people. I’d happily just farm for the rest of my life
Pomme de terre??
As an American I don't feel this to be all that weird. America has huge differences in demographics. The central Midwest, Bible Belt, and Soutwest (there's a little overlap) are all much less densely populated than either coast or the Great Lakes.
🎶Country roads, French Virginia🎶
Ill save you some time the anser is farm Land ...........11min for that
The county, in America, where i grew up in has about 68,000 people in an area of 17684 sq kilometers.
Why do you add an accent to certain cities but not Paris?
File it with Haitians since France basically destroyed their country for decades
👍👏
The richer a population gets, the more it’s birth rate slows. There’s eventually a threshold where a constantly booming vibrant population actually becomes a handbrake on the economy. People have to be able to afford children in the era they are going to raise them in and have enough work life balance to be able to meet partners without being exhausted from work. There’s a reason why historically massively over populated regions with giant birth rates have been poor, because there aren’t enough resources to go around and the resources that do exist are spent on just trying to keep people alive, not trying to improve their quality of life. It’s a bit hard to focus on building trains, high price goods and infrastructure when you just need to make sure that 10,000 people don’t die at their next meal.
Not a special question to begin with. You could do this with any country
Ah yes LA CREUSE
I'm pretty sure that this video just showed a town that my family drives past when we go to Spain on vacation: Lozére... we've always wanted to stop by because it looks pretty, but we never did.
I live in this empty area 😂 We call it « diagonale du vide » which means empty diagonal . My city is 150k inhabitants so not that empty
damn crazy how shit and full of filler "facts" this video is. visual spam
Anyone else feel like his videos pretty much feel like someone trying to reach the minimum word limit for an essay? Gets really tiring just hearing the same point constantly repeated over and over like he hadn't even mentioned it 3 times before.
Its Aliens
Being playing ac unity nowdays is amazing to me how overpopulated is the city of Paris, sometimes is anoying because theres to much people in the streets
The (non-existent) “state” of “palestine”
This video is kinda clown shit… like duh the centre between 2 waters will be less populated…. Smh
The real question is why 2/3 of france is populated to begin with
2:38 "The least populated departement in France is..."  Me : La Creuse, obviously. R.L.L.: "Lozère."  Impossible. On m'aurait donc menti tout ce temps...
There is no state of palestine
I really enjoy how you include the national forests and parks in green. It makes the map of Europe you are showing so interesting to see.
Yeah, so whats a good French real estate site?
7:49 If you look close enough, the Empty Diagonal could go deep into southern Portugal (Alentejo and Algarve).
Egypt: amateurs
Thanks a lot for the video very interesting
Pésents
Presents?
Uh. Did he say France is almost identical in size to India?... quick togoogle search': France is 210 thousand square miles. India is 1.2 million? Am I missing something
Another problem is France is too centralized, this has of course played a role in the rural exode giving less autonomy to the regions compared to the Bundeslands in Germany for example
7:47 you mean no one lives in the Atlantic Ocean by the French/Spanish border. Interesting...
Next: Why 2/3 of Spain is Empty
Pennsylvania has a similar empty central region. 50% of the people live in or near Philadelphia in the east or Pittsburgh in the west and the rest of the state, especially the north central region are super underpopulated. Lycoming county is 2.7% of the states area but only 0.89% of the states population.
The real answer is that everybody there saw something scary and surrendered then retreated. Right now those lost inhabitants are travelling around trying to find some nazis to join forces with.
Can i buy land in lozare ?
The empty diagonal extends across Spain.  **sad Madrid noises**
I always thought of France as more of a pentagon
I saw the thumbnail and thought “what did Germany do this time”
You make it sound like having less people is a BAD thing....... I would beg to differ 😒
Do the same for Australia
Never once heard of l'hexagone
Video starts at 3:21
5:40 why pronounce the first 3 with a french accent only to pronounce Paris the english way?
To the state of Palestine ? I'm sure it's this country doesn't exist atm but ok
1:47 tells much to any person not living in West Virginia...
Because that's where the real french live.
the first 3 minutes are so repeitive. you say the same thing 10 times.
xd spain
What's wrong with having a large part of your country unpopulated
Probably because of the Tarasque
Thanks for mentioning Palestine
It's similar in Germany. If you throw a dart at a german map, you'll probably end up hitting a racoon in "north-hassian sibiria". The only reason why the small city of Kassel (only 200k inhabitants) is showing up on most weather maps, is because it's the largest city in an empty circle with a diameter of almost 200km.   Hamburg, Berlin, Saxo-Thuringia, Nürnberg, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Ruhr-Area are forming a circle around the empty center of Germany. All the major population center are basically closer to the next border (~100km for most of them), than to racoon-city.  There is a second "empty region" in Germany though, which is the north-east, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and northern Brandenburg.
The solution is UBI. People stay in cities because they're terrified of financial instability and lack of opportunity. Just give them the financial stability and they'll create the opportunities for each other. At the same time, all the people who are only in and near cities because they have to slave at garbage jobs for a living get to leave and settle elsewhere. Countryside housing, insurance, and groceries, also cost a lot less. Not having to drive hours to a garbage job to barely pay the rent and bills is also very important. Many people live just within short enough of a distance to make working their current job enough to not spend more living there and commuting daily than they earn from that job., especially around Paris.
And then there is Italy, with just cities over and over, no empty mm of land. Seriously there are so many big cities here
Where is the state of Palestine I can’t find it on the map?
All this video did was ignite my want to move to the French countryside and never be seen again and I don't think it'd be too widely unaffordable either.
Cool!  I can buy a cheap house there!!!
-Talks about a population density   Australia  “Hold my beer”
You need to talk less and gets to the point more directly. Got bore about 3 minuttes in.
The TGV speed trains from Paris to Marseille goes right through this area 👌  beautiful 😍  Canyons, lakes and vast green Moores ...
To make space for the begets
Australia = That's cute.
Clickbait.
2:46 PALESTINE DOSENT EXIST

4:45 is that a real castle ?? Looks crazy insane & cool
So is immigration from other western nations to these less populated areas easier?  Retirement people bring with them a constant and reliable income stream.  Just curious.  Happy Trails... Good show!
So what you're saying is the French countryside is the perfect place to settle my homestead 👀
It is the designated ground for invading German forces to build field camps
state of palestine?   oh, the west-bank.
Dude that's a great video! But why are you accenting so oftenly? That's a bit annoying
I love living in the countryside b/c it’s always much quieter.
1:51 a better translation would be 'void diagonal', and it's  not only expert, a lot of people call it that way and it's often discussed on the political stage
there is also Antarctica, and the non-populated islands.
5 of the 15 starting players for the french rugby team come from a 55km radius to the left of Toulouse within the diagonal. The region has a population of 500k of Frances 67million
As a frenchman i know very well about this, since we don't stop having anoying exams on this boring subject at school
I've just noticed, the area you drew on France looks like a star with a bra on
"palestine" is not a state.....
I have never heard anyone in France ever referring to France as l'hexagone.
I'm don't respect france people, auchan leroy merlin and other france companies trading with putin/russia and i must speak on this, in central and "east" country people don't like this behavior, we are all in European Union and you don't understood this, we are not equal ha*tfuu Francy
That's like asking why the Rockies are empty, people like the ocean
The farmers league
I think I would like to live in the countryside and visit the populated cities.
"The state of Palestine" ooooh you did not say that :D
"France is a major global great power" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mmmmmmm
1:23 That's only because of Paris.
Great video and im down to buy the nebula bundle but you cant buy it with paypal why is that?
2:47 State of Palestine ??? Interesting...
Damn that image told me it was gonna be a spanish invasion of France
Auguste Comte,  Sounds like a sensible person.
hi
“People actually do be living in cities” -RLL 2022
Your video is backwards. Answer the question first and then talk about population density and then about France. Grab my attention by answering your question and then increase the scope of information. Having to wait through an entire video to get the answer angers me
I've never liked the hexagon reference, France looks much more like an octagon. Or at a minimum, a septogon.
thank you so much for the mentioning of palestine's statehood, <3 it's a small thing but it means a lot to normalize it
Yeah no India is like 7x bigger than France wtf are you talking about
damn the empty belt seems comfy
mountains, farms, not complicated. more empty land in the US.
Did the video actually give a population number for people in the empty diagonal?
Next video: why 98% of Canada is empty.
This video fails to mention that the reason for low birth rates is the rise of feminism and the pill, which is the main reason that so many western and eastern countries are failing to meet population replacement rates which needs to rise from 1.9 births per house hold to 3.5, the only regions in the world where this is still happening is the middle east and Africa, both of which have the majority of third world countries, hmm I wonder if education has anything to do with population collapse
As you said, population size widely explains the power of a country. However in France, around half of the population thinks that the country is on the wane because of immigrants. This is a nonsense. The first thing France needs to do to recover its power is to increase its population size, thanks to immigrants for example.
TLDR: Much of the rural population moved to cities (urban).
The solution comes from total planning.  All rural areas need hubs that are mini cities. We should see high rises in the middle of rural areas that house a decent amount of people and have significant diversity of commercial jobs. Proper rail needs to connect these places so people can quickly move to higher speed hubs.  Green highways need to connect all cities together and the rails need to also funnel goods like rivers to all hubs.  Finally cities need to have some limits as well to maintain balance.  Property taxes that are based on land value as well as personal wealth and how much other property you own is needed to make it extremely uneconomical to have large holdings in cities and make it so property remains cheap, equal, and construction balanced across all areas. The top goal should be ecology and food growth preservation. Farm land should be top priority so we don't head to a food insecure future. It should be very common for 15 thousand people living in a block area with farm surrounding it. From that the cities should become much smaller and form walkable islands.   That is important to the future and I don't see many countries that will prioritize that over everything else.
It's mostly just natural geography. The southwest portion was a massive wetland, which today is covered in Landes forest. The South-Central area is the Massif Central, which is a mountainous area with thin, rocky soil, historically poor road connections, no navigable rivers, and a colder climate.
Don’t give russia any ideas now…
A few hours ago, I was looking at a map of France to locate where René Descartes was born (I study philosophy) and realised how empty it seemed. Sometimes I feel like this channel is able to read my mind.
I swear if this video ends up being 11 minutes of you dodging the explanation that people tend to live near coasts I'm unsubscribing.  edit: oh look, 7 minutes in he's finally getting to that explanation. What a waste of a video, stop dragging everything out trying to make a 10 minute video.
Merci for this great video !
The video is interesting but it doesn't talk about the fact France has a huge agriculture market and its one of our main exports and we also have plenty of protected lands on that diagonal as "natural ressources", so the "empty" parts of France are both good for agriculture AND a balanced environment. Not to say pollution isnt a problem in France, but theres at least a few regions where you can go to spend days fully immersed in nature.
I am not french and i never heard of that before.
The countryside is a breeding ground for conservatism, therefore we should let it die. Let the countryside return to nature.
I created a simulation of develop of war between Russia and Ukraine, available on my channel
You keep saying the same thing over and over for three minutes at the beginning. We get it, not many people live there. Move on.
Frogless ? Who cares ? They occupy the coco areas of Africa!
It’s basically the same how the us is heavily populated on the East and west coast but there’s almost nothing in the Midwest compared to the coasts. Texas can be seen as an exception
Yes sir
so interesting
As you showed, compared to Spain, France's interior depopulation is a joke.
Wait until you see australia
Uk have population density like 280 per square kilometre but England has much higher —430 per 1 km
Simpel answer? Because it's france.
The diagonal has a population density of 78/sq mile, per Wikipedia. For comparison, Wyoming is 6 and Alaska is 1.3… Seems like a totally natural occurrence for countries to have more and less dense areas.
Liberal progressives have destroyed Europe. France is no different
Thank you so much buddy of making so much good content about my country, i discovered your channel by watching your video about the potential of a reunited HRE  Merci énormément l'ami
People really do be living
Why is this even worthy of mentioning?
enough with the bait arrows, unsubbed
I live in central Europe, about 400 km from the coastline. Certainly without any need to move closer to it. I reside in Bratislava and work in Vienna, commuting every day by train. How much more central European can you be?
He mentions the "state of Palestine." There is no state of Palestine. Odd.
“The state of Palestine” wow...
500 billion is still taken and stolen from colonized african countries TODAY.. ITS AMAZING CALLING THEM RICHEST COUNTRY . BIG THIEVES .
Why am I always watching this  at like 1 am
& how empty is the US...?
Lol, we Australians think this is stupid.
Only eleven seconds in and we hear "Nearly identical in size to India"...
ReaLifeLore please make a video which is something new, not something about Europe or America that is boring or anything bad about poor nations you always say good stuff about Europe and America but Asia and Africa are always negative in your videos
to many ads
6:57 The piano gets extremely distracting here.
Funny you didn’t mention the Dutch inhabitants density. It’s one of the most dense in the world
im sure that if they make france africa enough it will solve everything  definitely dont reduce the pressure on country side and native french
"The population density of people is only about 30 persons per square kilometer - about the same as the US state of west Virginia. Which has lead to French Demographers referring to the area as L'West Virginia."
simple. wind farms and grow animal feed to export. extreme sports facilities also draw a crowd
There is a similar issue in the Scottish highlands and island.  One thing not mentioned is that in the Scottish highlands and islands properties are often bought up and used for holiday homes or tourist accommodation.  This pushes up the price of the limited housing stock and makes it very difficult for locals to buy a home even if they wanted to stay in the area.
The diagonal u drew in Spain makes 0 sense since it includes Basque Country (highly populated) and Madrid.
Why 9/10 of Canada is empty
4x less??? You do mean 25% of, right?
State of palestine my ass
Geography lesson: Israel is the correct country 🇮🇱. There is no place called palestine, and it is not a state or country.
Meanwhile in Canada...
"TLDR: The center of France is basically farmland."
There are less people in a.... RURAL AREA?????? MY GOD WHAT WILL WE DO!!!
Ah, I live in that diagonal...

Is it bad that as soon as I saw the image I immediately thought "So that's why Kalos was shaped like it was..."
And this is why Italian villages are offering up homes for 1€.
Does anybody know the name of the music used for most of the video? It's dope
France looks more like a Pentagon if you ask me
The WWI and WWII  had horrible consequences , and that is why we should really try to make agreements instead of killing each other . In 2022 , nobody wins by destroying cities and killing populations .And there should be more farm lands in every countries .  Nobody wants to live in a place where there are 10000 habitants every cubic meter .
Kinda reminds me of certain regions in the UK which we would refer to as dead towns/regions due to declining industries in the areas. Therefore a lot of the people leave and move elsewhere. Parts of wales and the north east are example’s.
“Wow! People actually do be living in cities”  - RealLifeLore
One of your worst videos, littered with errors
And then there’s Canada
Ahh, "la diagonale du vide"
I would not use Palestine as your size comparison because the Palestinians do not agree on the borders and many see all of Israel as theirs and Israel does not see Palestine as it's own country so yeah, you have a land shape that neither side agrees on and are using a hot topic for no reason... What about Rhode Island?   A bit of safer bet....
Real life lore: the middle of France is empty   Australians: fascinating
The French fold
2:46 nice!
til france and india are the same size
Because they stink 😵
Laughs in Australian
One solution to the empty diagonal would be to build, in it, many low-rise U.S.-style exurbs linked by lots of super highways, with said houses given to families with lots of  kids.  Secondly, grab every Ukrainian refugee for Diagonal settlement.  Stuff like that.
African and Middle Eastern people: It's free real estate!
Nice!! (pardon my french)
"4 times division less" still don't know where that confusing turn of phrase came from.
Well, in brazil the effect is eaven worse. I bet 80% of The population lives in around 10 or 20% of The country
Can’t this be said about the US’s population density as well? A quick google search shows ~55 million people living on the west coast and ~155 million on the east coast. That’s ~210 million people between the two coasts alone - So ~100 million people fill in ALL the other states. You could add in a few states with higher population than others and end up with even fewer people in even more states. Texas has ~30 million - other southern border states also have a little bit higher dispersion of people.   You can do this with just California alone too. People in California are clustered on the coast and in the major cities. There are not as many people in the desert (I wonder why) or in the mountains (I wonder why). As you go up the state, the population density lessens as well (I wonder why).  This just seems like the general rule for existence. People want to live near other people.
simply madrid empty original drastically Finland's population
State of Palestine? wtf state is that lol?
Lol They have the 8th best FUNDED military in the world. Guess that's true.
AKA France has a midwest too.
You could say the same for the internal United States. But I don't really see the problem.
Sus is in there!
TEMA LA TAILLE DE LA DIAGONALE
hmm
2:45 Palestine is NOT a country!
next video: *why 99.9999% of canada is empty*
I miss living in Europe, can't wait to go back
Palestine is ~2M, Gaza is another ~2M and they're separate. Not the same state and not the same government.
To me France's shape has always been a star or  a pentagon not a hexagon
This isn’t really unusual. Most countries have empty quarters.
What is palastine?
America also has a giant empty region in the middle. I wouldn't be surprised if most countries do, TBH.
I give you like and share just because you mentioned the state of Palestine
I really thought he was going to talk about French Guiana
france
I'm sorry, but this idea of a vague region of France being a bit more empty than the rest is so stupid. It's just the countryside, and just happens to be less populated, because that's what happens. The area is just a rough random sliver that is chopped out in a way that is made to look bad, but is really just the land between all the cites, between the coasts.  And that expansion into Spain was just wrong as well. Spain has its own serious population issues, but having an empty chunk down the middle certainly isn't one of them. As you can clearly see in the video (7:51), the "empty" land includes Madrid and the Basque region, two of the most populated places, and then in the south, it just conveniently dodges all the cities. Yeah, that's the point, but there's nothing interesting about noticing a slightly less populated part of a country. Being far from cities and the coast just means it will be empty. There is nothing more to it, which is why most of the video is padded out with the story of France demography instead of actually discussing the titular topic.   I feel like quite a few recent RLL videos have been a bit like this though (like the other France one, China, Portugal), and I'm just concerned, as I've been here for so long. Modern conflicts has been generally really good, as have some other videos, so I don't understand why concepts like this that could be made into a single quirky map facts. Most of these "did you know 99% live in circle" ideas are stupid to begin with other than as a huh that's interesting, because mostly there's just not an interesting story, it's just how it is.  I don't mean to be mean or anything, and honestly I doubt anyone will ever read this. Besides, views don't seem to be taking a hit mostly, and with sponsored uploads this frequently taking millions of views RLL must be rolling in it.
I've worked and lived inside this diagonale coming from the metropolitain area of paris I can say it was a really big change. the rural part of france are fashionable right now, lots of city dwellers relocating to thes parts, and of course there is a culture clash
Great video. I'm from UK and I had a house in French countryside. I didn't realize, it's landmass is 5 times bigger than UK and you can see star in sky in countryside with more details than I've ever seen before.
France lost 10% of it's young male population in WW2  Germany: why is this some kind of problem?  Germany lost about 40% of its population over the 30 years war, at least some part of young men in the Napoleonic wars, 2 million young men in WW1, and about 10% of its entire population in WW2.
I love your videos about population zones, particularly the one about Canada’s population.  I would love to see more as you make more videos.
they do be kinda livin in cities doe
Portugal’s Alentejo region has forever been underpopulated. The majority of Portuguese population are in the Lisbon metro area and the North (birthplace of the country). The Alentejo is empty , the Algarve is mainly touristy and transient with vacationers.
I wouldn’t want to live next to French people either
I'm from the countryside too(although not the french one), and i would never leave it for the city. I spent a vacation travelling around France and i can say that the rural areas are the best parts of the country. Sure, Paris has nice buildings and interesting museums, Normandy and Brittany is rich with history and the Riviera has great beaches, but nothing beats the calmness and beautiful landscapes of the french countryside.
2:51 OMG It's my village !!! Paulhe Aveyron ! I'm shocked it's on here haha. You should have told me, I would have waved at the camera.
France is the 3rd most populous country in Europe is an impossible riddle to solve for me, Germany counts as Europe I assume, so which one doesnt Russia or Turkey? Or both dont and he thinks the UK has more ppl than France?
I'd argue that the French military is better funded than the US', as I disagree with the idea of quantity = quality when it comes to pumping money into a system (I doubt the US are getting good bang for their buck on military spending, healthcare spending, and prison spending).
lol 1:54 Auxerre
0:00 - Hi RLL. 👋 11:01 - Like from me. 👍 Cheers.
This makes it sound like it's a problem. It's not.
Wait till you find out how much empty space we have here in Canada.
0:13 yea because France and it's buddy the Brits assraped India for 200 odd years, before they arrived india's economy was 25% of the entire worlds economy, they left with it being less than 2% of the worlds economy.
Before video guess..... the world wars?
And off course i'm born into it. So lucky🤣
Dislike for "do be." Don't be like that.
Paris isn't on the coast, wtf I didn't know about that. I always thought it was.
This reminded me of the decreasing population of JAPAN and GERMANY made sense to me. Probably Russia ,too.
Palestine is a country.
There are still some large towns and cities in that red band. Toulouse included. Clermont. Brive. Pau. Auxerre. Troyes. Reims.
Never wanted to visit France, no idea just don’t like France only reason I’d cost europe is to see the military history museum
Always said the worst part of France is the french people so at least i know where to go visit
Short answer: it’s France, do you need a reason to want to avoid it?
Interesting video. But my question is….who is in Paris?
Recently the UK replaced frances 3rd place as most populated country in europe
Fun fact farmers have the most children in very country oddly enough then again I hate cities
8:14 "Or 4 times less people" I think you meant 1/4th as many people because that barely made sense lol. I knew what you were trying to say though
Spain case is even worst
Main while Germany 15% of all the males died during ww2   Germany 89 million
What started out as a geographical and demographic is turning into a political debate.sad
To many adds
Now do Canada, where 95%+ lives along the USA border on a strip of land that represents not even 10% of the land mass.
that can be say in just one word...Mountains !
I'm glad I'm one of those people who doesn't like large cities or being around people in general.  I love waking up every morning knowing that I'm a mile away from my closest neighbor.
My girlfriend's grandfather lives in Guéret, Creuse, in this empty diagonal
This is so cool, I want to see these areas
Because the French population isn't that big
14000 seats to spair right? (talking about losaire filling wembly)
Your shilling tactics have become downright disgusting, have some decency and be frontal about it at the very least, chap
I have noticed that auverne rhone alps is this area.?
Why is the whole central United States so underpopulated...?
I'm leaving in this empty void. In the south west. There's still a lot of people living there but it's true that not much is happening
Canadians: "Pfft, amateurs"
France is not a great world power anymore.
That's a lot of good demographic history but the basic title premise seems peculiar- don't most countries have uneven population distribution due to: geography [topography, rivers, soil patterns, etc.] and history [urbanization, war]? I looked at the map and thought, well most of the south of that is in the massif centrale, much of the north is in the WW1 red zone, so...  I'm a Canadian, most of my country is empty for even more obvious reasons.
I was expecting something like 5 or 10, when he said 30 I went like bruuuuuuuh. The average population density in our country is 24.
People do be actually living in cities. Did he just become a memelord?
7:48 What? That entire country looks empty as fuck, and you decide to include the one massive red blob into your so called 'empty area'. Looks like this video, or rather whatever source it is based on, was just pulling out shit out of its ass at this point.
Awesome 👌
Let's just be real here, for a second.   By the middle of this century, 99% of humanity is going to be dwelling in some kind of city, anywhere on the planet. This is clearly the direction the human species is drifting in, and why would that change at all? Cities are where prosperous life is most possible, in today's world, really. And young people, starving for success, are drawn to that. It's really only the aging population who yearns for "the simple rustic life." And that population is dying off (even if at a frustratingly slow rate, thanks to modern medicine).
Based real life lore calling Palestine a state
If the "state of Palestine" is real, why does it have no real life lore?
Nice video again, RealLifeLore
Questions I never knew I needed the answer to.  :)
Can you guys do a video on Spain next please
Me, a Canadian:  That "empty diagonal" looks crowded...
Cap. France doesn't exist.
You should look at the demographics of the Appalachian mountains.   I live in Scott County VA and these counties are facing the same thing. No local industry means that young people leave. The whole area is being hollowed out.
Interesting and as always well documented facts... yet, those are demographics facts valid not only in France but literally all over the world...  The industrialization of the agriculture - more commonly known as mechanization - leading to the today's modern mechanized agriculture requiring less and less workers, for those who can afford to invest in the latest equipment, is inevitably leading to the remaining workers in the area, now with no jobs and fewer opportunities, moving away chasing jobs and a paycheck in more populated urban areas...  this side effect can be seen all over the Europe and the US and Canada, and pretty much all over the world...  Ironically enough along with using in excess growth hormones, and herbicides, and pesticides, and chemical fertilizers (and who knows what else) not only the quality and flavor of the agricultural products is lower (the cost of higher quantities) but large areas become less populated with significant ripple effects in the economy of those affected areas...  Sad facts and secondary effects of the modernization of the agriculture...  A similar phenomenon is happening already with the modernization of the industry using robots and automatic machines, and that combined with the outsourcing jobs outside the country for cheaper workforce...so by extension corporate greed is already leading to the same effects more people with less jobs, all struggling for a limited amount of resources, and maybe that's why COVID happened and soon more serious and devastating wars will start...  It's a Domino effect...
Population density of England is actually over 400, the 270 number refers to including all the islands, scotland, wales etc
lozere is in the center of the diagonal? Really? That doesn't fit your graphics X)
Thank you for the shout out
Bro this sounds like an essay where you need to boost the words to meet the count
2:17 That is the Uk. England is over 400 /km^2
as a french it makes me laugh to see the other country's view about france lmao
India is 6 time bigger than France….
The Netherlands hitting the density with 507
there is no Palestine!
Skip to 3:20 to actually get to the point.
Not sure if I have overseen it but main reason is of course the bombs and mines in the area...(WW2) There are even places where you are not allowed to go. Just for Info
you totally need to talk about spains population density. the issue is way bigger than in france, being that almost the entire population lives either in the coast or in madrid in the center, leaving a huge ring around madrid where many parts are called "la españa vacía", literally the empty spain. take a look at it it's very interesting like for reaL
Come in India you will know the real meaning of population 😂😂😂
Expanding the corridor into Spain is interesting. I can't help but wonder, if continental Europe was thinner, would this corridor still exist?
I am 36 years old and grew up in Lozère. It is the first time in my existence I hear someone from abroad talk about it. What a thrill! 😂
#0:12 : Nearly identically in size to India…   India 🇮🇳 3,287,263 km2 France 🇫🇷 643,801 km2
the state of what?
Bien sûr, La France. And everybody knows that hexagons are the bestagons.
Did covid change the trend of people moving back to the country ? It did in Canada
I'm from South Dakota and I found this offensive. I just think it's funny that the county I live in has the same population density as the part of France being discussed here, and it is one of the largest counties by population in the state.
What is The State of Palestine its just Palestine
That "almost empty" region has over 50% higher population density than my country (Finland).
Funny how the middle of the country is called “countryside”.
Sorry, but why is tis in any way instructuve of anything? There are many countries in Europe, Asia, North America that have areas that are sparesely populated. This comes from conservation of agricultural land, wild areas, areas of natural beauty, harsh climate, mountains, desert etc etc. What a pointless bait click video.
I just laughed at your intro "France is a major power and has been for centuries" LOL it took Hitler 2 weeks to defeat France...
what did you just call belarus
As a French person living in this zone It's really empty we use to drive 4 hours to get KFC every weekend it's that bad.
Well half of Russia is empty what’s the point??
Hey question cus i dont like google ;) ; when in english you say the end of the 18th century, does that mean the end of the 1800’s (like 1870, 1890 whatsoever) or does that mean the end of the 1700’s ?? Because in the netherlands, the 18th century means all the years from 1700 till 1799. Hope that makes sense, wanted to know if this is a dutch thing or worldwide thing!
2:45 why is there an empty area in video to the right ?
You could do a whole series about population densities and trends. I'm reading comments about empty land and centralization problems from dozens of countries here. I'll throw my hat in too, Ireland is the only country (barring a few tiny island nations) in the world that has a lower population now than it did in the 1800s. Other countries have overpopulation problems, we're only just about to recover (population-wise) from English rule.
02:48 what do you mean 'the state of Palestine'? No such place exists?
I feel like this whole video could be summed up as "Places away from the coastline and major rivers tend to have a low population density with occasional exceptions". No need for a 10 min video. And continuing the line into Spain is just silly as the line goes through Madrid! How is that low density?
About 20% of France's population lives in the Paris Metropolitan Area. Over 50% of South Korea's population lives in the Seoul Metropolitan Area. Might make a good video.
the netherlands has 500+ pp per sq km
Answer....it isnt..according to this video
I’d rather live in French wine country than in a smog filled city with no land.  Thanks, but no thanks.
There are some solutions but they are to radical. For example banning leaving from the areas would fix the problem but would a revolution (again)
7:49 Look at this empty diagonal! Madrid: Am I a joke to you?
Make something on uk next
Next video: why 2,5/3 of spain is empty
This report literally told me nothing.
If I had to live in France, I would of course choose the place with the least people
Bruh my uncle lives in this line 😅
France is 1/6th of India in size.. its not identical in size
There is no state Palestine
La diagonale du vide plante son drapeau !
Why is this video not on nebula yet?
Australia is empty…
Sorry, you just talk so long and so much random nonsense about something that is explained in one sentence. Also it's sometime the opposite of what can be seen on screen (Lower end is not landlocked, expansion into spain includes Madrid).
This video makes it seem like it's an issue, but isn't it good environmentally that we have sparsely populated areas just for nature and preservation? I think I prefer that we have large urban areas, then the rest would be a scatter or small towns and medium-sized cities. Having wilderness and nature reserves is a good thing. I'd hate to live in a country where you drive for miles and kilometers and just see Urban sprawl, with little nature and space in between. Plus, not all people would want to live in massive urban centres. There are people who would want to live in a much slower paced, lesser populated areas. I think in the future, if the population keeps growing, there will be a strain on resources, and arable land and space is important to have. Urban areas are not necessarily good for growing crops so France having this empty space, which looks lush and arable, is a good thing!
So the conclusion of this ten minute video is "people actually do be living in cities" 😄
Vendee best department.
Hey i live in this part!
Bro made a 10+ minute vid to say people live near coasts 💀
Jeez, you took 11 mins to explain people migrating to urban centers. Get to the point faster
you can do this for any country, just draw a blob that only includes the lowest density areas and you get the same thing
TL;DW France has flyover country just like the U.S.
incroyable vidéo
America has its own blank strip of land that no one inhabits it’s called bread basket
Greetings from the empty zone!
Did anyone else see the thumbnail and thought: ah France is getting invaded again
lol I thought this was going to be about something interesting about france but this is just urbanization and mechanized farming -which happens literally everywhere; it what makes 'developed countries' developed. Sometimes, this channel...urg.
The casual “state of Palestine” drop was jarring. I remember a time where youtubers wouldn’t even mention that area in fear of starting a war in their comments
Palestine was much bigger before that western backed apartheid state came
You just put Madrid and the basque country as the empty part of spain💀
There is no state of Palestine lmao
So... countryside? Not sure why this is a problem. Food is being produced and the landscapes are beautiful. A base level of modern infrastructure should be kept up, but there will always be some people who prefer a quiet village to a bustling city.
What's the deal with Clermont-Ferrand then?
“Wow! People actually DO be living in cities.”
The city I live in is from three major bodies of water away with less than 90 kilometers, the river Elbe (about 20 km), the North Sea (about 80 km), and the Baltic Sea (about 70 km). So yeah, I live near the ocean
I find it really interesting that we consider a region like this to be "empty" today, but similarly insist that largely unpopulated pre-colonial regions (North America, Australia) were "already inhabited" when the colonizers came. It seems hypocritical for someone to attack the old colonizers when trying to "fix" a rural region. I'm not necessarily justifying what those colonizers did back then, but there are lots of people in rural regions who like their way of life and their population densities as they are. Why should some bureaucrat or city person try to fix something that's better the way it is? As a rural Appalachian, please stop bringing your cities to the country. There are people in those rural regions, and most of them don't want your "better" ways of doing things.
Reason number one = Coal  People are living in the North-East because it's where coal mines are. Factories in the XIXth century needed coal to function.
0:04 *Not Nice.* Pun intended.
Rename the region "omelette du fromage" and the people will flock there
‘State’ of Palestine???
Please make a video about low birth rates in Spain 🙏🙏🙏
I live in the "dead zone" and to be honest it's so dead that it's even possible to learn the language of your own region
‘Empty’. You just described the most beautiful parts of France as being ‘empty’. Wtf.
Can you do a video on why Belgium actually excists? Because even we Belgians don't know and since you know everything, maybe you can tell us
Regardless of all this, aren’t such areas a necessity for civilization? The most fertile lands are often set aside for food production, and in the aim of maximizing food production, the fewest possible number of people working those lands is preferred, as it means less space being used for housing.  Edit: this got somewhat big. In the current times, this kind of thing is likely to happen, since we have refrigeration, which allows the transportation of food over long distances. So, grow food where it’s easy, ship it to where it’s needed.  Edit2: This comment has gotten bigger. So yes we would actually want the industries to be spread out to minimize transportation, but I feel this mostly applies to artisans; some industries really benefit from mass production, specially things like medicines or materials processing (turning plant or animal products into cloth & leather, or sand & rocks into metals) or recycling, to name a few. Most relevant is probably the creation of meat based foods benefiting greatly from the mass production of feed for the animals, which can be grown far from where the animals are kept & slaughtered.
No way on earth… sorry, no way in France it takes 11 minutes to explain the reason…
What does "four times less" mean? One-fourth? Then maybe say "one-fourth".
Paris, Madrid and Berlin have something in common. They are all quite substantial agglomerations, but as soon as you go further out, you will end up in agricultural nothingness for a few hundred kilometers until you get to an area where mid-sized towns are a bit closer to each other. That also shows in the transportation network in France. Board a TGV into any direction and it's likely a nonstop train going almost to the end of the country. Others will stop at obscure stations in the middle of the field with no nearby town. It's always a good way until you get to the next place of importance that's not just a suburb of the capital. West Germany on the other hand has a more polycentric structure.
0:03  France : *feeling significant* America : Hi!👋
Laughs in not having any dead space. Even our low density areas are dense, if not with people, with cows.
When you say identical in size to India, I hope you don't mean land mass because India is 6 times (1.269 Million sq miles)  the size of France (210,016 sq miles).
Perhaps all these countries could take some of England’s. We have a supposedly right wing government but don’t stop bring in immigrants. Legal, illegal, we don’t care.
Curious, this overly dramatic lisper pronounces the word during "deering".
1 minute in and I think we can guess who has seen CGP Grey's video
I would love to live in a villa in rural southern France, but my french ain't good enough
Real life lore never disappoint
Hey, 30 people/km2 isn’t that bad, right? *looks around at fellow nordic countries*
0:47 I never thought France looks like a hexagin but like a star ⭐ (or maybe a pentagon). 🤔   Who as well?
The script and narration of this video sound like a poor copycat of the real channel.
This video is kinda dumb
turn on the subtitle, Lozere become Loser
1:54 Gonna be frank, I didn't expect my hometown - a small rural city of 40K+ inhabitants, known mainly for a very minor league soccer team - to show up in this video.  And yet, here we are.
Wow
Because the fr*ench live in France 🤮
This is very interesting and I can observe it in my country, too. But one question: Why do we automatically regard this as an "issue" to be fixed? We are currently fighting with loss of habitats and biodiversity all over the world, mostly due to agriculture, but also ever increasing settlements and road building. Having people mostly in denser areas seems to be a natural remedy to this.
Meanwhile italy is so fucking dense
Am I the only one who enjoyed the background tracks?
I don't understand how this is an anomaly. This looks normal to me. If it was a stark decide, I would understand, but it's not. You can claim this about every country.
The entire city of Madrid was in that zone!
England's population density is way higher than 270 people/km2. The number refers to the whole UK.
I think I'm gonna- 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
It seems everyone is unable to populate agriculture areas. You have to create your own amenities.
Ah, always called that part the Rave Party Motherland but I guess the Void Diagonal can do too.
Hexagon is the bestagon
6:42 i feel like this is supposed to show where the mountainous region is?
Black Spot
I always saw France as a pentagon...
okay he went from "this whole middle part is practically uninhabited" to "there are about thirty persons per square kilometer" so it's not practically uninhabited. It's in fact VERY inhabited.  Okay and now he's like "lozere is right in the center of the diagonal" as it's shown off to the side of the diagonal near the ocean.  April fools and it's not even april yet.
Boring 😥😥

This is cherry picked af
this is crazy no wonder napoleon was so good
I would love to see a video about stereotypes about countries that just aren't right
Thanks to the government covid killed half of the population
france is similar to russia in terms of the population loss
Now do “Why 98% of people in Australia live near coastal cities” 🤣
I'm just wondering how many toyota corollas would fit into that part of france
"Why 1/3 of France is almost empty"? Well, it should be obvious: they gotta stay true to their flag. You got blue on one side, red on the other, and the middle is just empty.
“That is comparable to the state of Palestine.”  Israel: 🧐🤔
Technology + Liberalism + Sexual liberation + Loss of religion = Demographic death. Tell me how I am wrong.
Fr*nce 🤢🤮
As someone who lives in as small town, the answer to the "mistery" of the empty regions in France was painfully obvious throughout the video, I'm glad he acknowledged the obvious answer at the end
Not if i eat mona lisa
lol
Thank you for saying the state of Palestine ❤️
🇫🇷👎👎
There is no "state of palistine", Learn history Anti-Semite.
get to the point already
Love from spain
Don't worry africans immigrants, will fill the population back up
e
France is more of a Pentagon really
there is no such thing as the state of arab / moslom Palestine.....ALL that land belongs to the Hebrew people
France isn't real.
so it is free real estate?!   jk I am American we have the midwest to conquer still lol (and Alaska one day once the earth warms up enough)
“1000 km long and 400 km wide”  *Googles how many miles a km is
interesting
France owe a lot to Africa. It's sad seeing France so rich for just 60 million people but childrens and masses dying in Africa because of hunger. Stealing wealth of other countries and doing genocides...
1:29 your population map looked like moldy cheese
I like how you say 8th most funded military.... however you didn't mention its strength
I love how you make me care about these things
As a rural fellow myself, I think I would definitely prefer living in this more sparsely populated countryside lol. Thank you for another interesting and informative video though guys! Stay well out there everybody, and God be with you, friends. ✝️ :)
this video just keep going in circles desperately trying to reach the magical 10 minute line.
bdw Palestine is not a country  :)
Lived in France for 2 years. Beautiful country, nice and warm people.  🇧🇦💙🇨🇵
Now I know where to plan my route through for a summer on a motorbike in France, thanks! :D
lier
This almost sounds like what Russia's going through today.
I'd wondered about France's surprisingly slow industrialisation rate. This finally explained it.
India is double cheese sandwich with extra topping 😂😂😂
The UK as a whole has 270, England alone is more than 400.
France: 1/3 of my country is empty :( Canada: Welcome to the club
Haha what a bunch of Lozères 😂
This guy would smash a level human geography
someone once said: Gallia est divisa in partes tres
“State” of Palestine 🤡🤡
8:11 is "4 times less people" the same as "one fourth as many people" ?
There is no state of Palestine as you claim at 2:48 in your video.   I don't know where you get your facts from.  Even if  you want to say that the state of Palestine has something to do with Israel, your statistic that the state of Palestine has 5,000,000 people in it, that number is totally inaccurate.
Please do a video on Russia's geographical spread
Because france needs an area to run to when anyone declares war on them.
what a non problem. all countries have pockets of lower density. Id say ts odd to assume the entire contry's population is evenly distributed across its land. Is the french population's distribution actually much worse then that of other countries? probably not.
That is the zone were Durex commercials have had the greatest success
There's no state of Palestine
Funnily enough the empty area in France has most of my favorite holiday spots. Lovely nature and awesome little towns with artisan markets and incredible good restaurants. We spend our summer holidays there and packed with a tent, we spend like 400€ for two weeks. It is incredibly underrated
Lemme talk about spain, cause it is even emptier
invested 11 mins and i missed the answer. oh well on to the next video. next time maybe you'd like to get to the point.
This video is ridiculous. All countries has low density areas: the highlands in the UK, central Spain, the Midwest in the USA….
Was this supposed to be released a few weeks from now on April 1st or something? Because I'm like 3 minutes in and the density of ridiculous statements to this point has been impressive. Like the idea that it would be at all abnormal to be able to draw a line through roughly the middle of a country where 60% lives on one side and 40% on the other, or the idea that it's even slightly newsworthy that across large countries, some areas are sparsely populated. And maybe it's a European thing or something, but I've literally never heard France be called "l'hexagon". And that "empty diagonal" just seems to be an amorphous zone gerrymandered to have as little population as possible, it has a random bulb sticking out of the side of it.
The State of Palestine does not exist and never has It is nothing more than a genocidal terrorist organization whose charter explicitly rejects all claims to the lands you showed  NEVER AGAIN
The Feench are lovers.  Of course they had more people.
I've always found it insane how geographically unbalanced the population distribution is in the UK is, to the point where one of it's constituent nations is mistakenly coterminous with the entire country. I guess land quality is indispensable for population growth.
You call it "empty" but the population density is double the average of my home country lol.
Video on kashmir
There's no such thing as state of Palestine ...  also, current number of Arabs living in Gaza and Judea and Samaria (part of Israel) are around 2.5 million people.  you "facts" are wrong my friend.
that sure took a long time to explain
I am more concerned about the fact that 1/3 of France is filled with immigrants🤔
why Madrid is so densly populated?
Who else was checking out France on Google maps during this video. 😆
Why don’t we settle the Ukrainian refuges in  empty areas of France  and Spain  ?
Its the same here in the UK.   Scotland where I live has less people than across in England.   I dodnt get the issue lol.   Americans just need to get a passport and travel more.
yeah ok
seeing this video in my recommended just made me laugh as a Canadian. we know something a bit about empty space here it seems
How can you be diminishing in influence for centuries?
So... he kinda missed how a significant part of the diagonal is mountainous (the Ardennes and the Massif central) while the more southern part is a huge swamp (les landes.)
i read title click on the video comment (i dont know) leaves
"Most people live close to the sea" - not for long.
If you draw arbitrary lines separating any country's least and most populated sections this is probably what you'd get. When you conveniently bend the line so that the shape doesn't contain any nearby major cities what else could you expect to happen? If you throw 5 darts at a dart board and then draw a line that encompasses a large region with no darts in, you can't then ask the question, "Why is half of this dartboard empty?".
0:13 France and India are not similar in size, India is about 6x bigger than France
Neat
Countries population should be measured along with its density. China and India in this regard are not very populated.
Empty
France's suposed dwindling power on the global scale being atributed to this diagonal is really strange. I don't see the link at all when this is also the case in most large countries.
It isn't unique to France. The US interior is also pretty empty, for example.
Who else thought this video would be about French Guyana??
All of the things explained in this video apply to Spain's interior (which has an even lower pop. density) except Madrid because by being the capital it has attracted all of the people around it, like a black hole. Everyone else lives by the coast.
yessss new video from one of the best channels on the site!!!  we love you Joseph mwah mwah mwah hug hug
I can see a few demographic similarities with where I live in Illinois. The center and about half the southern third are almost empty. Out of 12 million people, 9 million are in 6 counties of metro Chicago and another million are in the two counties next to St. Louis. So the other 94 counties have two million spread out across them. The few urban areas there are either river ports or university towns. The rest of the state is agricultural with an aging population since so many young people go to the two big metro or out of the state.
About the population density, could have added that the netherlands is at nearly 400 people/km2
I’m a french caribbean, was born on Martinique a French caribbean island. We got demographics issue in the french west indies, Guadeloupe and Martinique, people are forced to move out of their island to study or to find a job on the french mainland. Paris and a few other cities are like massives black hole that suck our population and it wont stop anytime soon, for that reason I a some anger towards the french government.   Our islands are always let behind of everything, even though it’s french territory just like Paris is, we had slavery, they polluted our land with pesticides, they lied to people so they can have labour to build their cities and even today, they dont talk about us in the news except for bad things, they wont take us into account when they make laws. The french just do not care about us
France reminds me of Pennsylvania in many ways. Except Pennsylvania has no TGV trains through it's low density parts to connect high density locations. Maybe PennDOT should take a look at this part of France to see how HSR can work in their "Low density" state.
"8th best funded military in the world"  90% of their budget is spent on white flags.  :)
Usually developed countries have lower birth rate thus having population decrease... It's not good for any country but we are told to control birth all over the world..So,what's the point?? Increasing population isn't a issue,decreasing is. We alrealy produce 1.5× the food we need..Hunger is caused by inequality not scarcity. I am gonna have as many children I could get.
dude is trolling now, going out of his way to find excuses to mispronounce Belarus
Right in the middle of that diagonal is the Dordogne department, which is one of the most beautiful regions of Europe.
1:49 pretty sure Spain's emptier than that, we've Got a lot of places with a population density being much lower than 20
What is up with empty spaces??????? Less people to spoil it.Just because land is available doesn't mean it needs people to live in it.If you want people packed in like sardines try London.
"40% of the entire global human population lives within just 100km of a coastline"  Climate change is really gonna fuck us up hard
Madrid is an empty space? :)
Thank you for recognising Palestine as a state. 🇵🇸
There us no such state as "Palestine", never was
France is a pentagon
You could draw a specifically crafted line through any country and make the exact same observations.
Effectivement il n'y a personne là bas
The empty diagonal is like Wyoming. It doesn't exist.
completely ignoring Madrid and Basque...
lets get to 69 million
Germany took it yesterday
Wait, since when has Palestine been a state? This is news to me.
Parlez vous Francais? Como t'apelle tu? Donde esta la biblioteca?
I honestly don't see the problem here, as long as we can find ways to make cities more sustainable and able to handle their enlarging populations in terms of housing, access to goods, etc. etc.  Unless that IS the problem.  But it seems like the focus of this is on how it's not good, somehow, to have big rural areas of low population density... and I don't get why that's a bad thing.  And I say this as someone who has lived his whole life in a rural area.  Maybe (as one for instance) it can help with mitigating habitat loss for wildlife a little to have more people living in cities.  Seems to me the problem is much more about how cities can handle their population increases.
these videos are way too long winded, you could say the same things in half the time without losing any important stuff and without it being too fast paced
Laughs in Nebraska Population Density.
me watching this from inside the void : pain
I just don't understand how most of humanity affords to live in cities and near the coast. It's so expensive. And most cities are very dirty and crowded and your quality of life really goes down.
"Why is 1/3 of France empty?", bro it should be more like "why isn't all France empty?"
That's interesting.... In other parts of the world such as Europe and Japan people  are worried about their land being empty while in India people are worried about lack of land..... Basically every inch of the land is occupied, even the Himalayas are somewhat populated
Wow, as an indian, so stupid of you to mention that India's economy is comparable to french right now just in the starting of this video, despite of the fact that India's economy is likely to get tripled or quadrupled in the coming decade and more so in the coming era's, as it's one of the fastest growing economy in the world. I just want to say that this comparison isn't going to last forever, not even in merely 2-3 years😐 but this video certainly will be, lol.😅
As a Frenchman I can confirm most of us see this space as a bunch of roads separating us from some cities
As a Canadian my first thought was 1/3 empty. Amateur!
Well for those of us who hate people in low dence popular population areas this is a good news for us
England has a population densisty of 434 per km2 the 270 figure is for the whole of the UK
Palestine Isint a state
I mean there's a solution, it's just quite costly: build there, build things like youth-centers, incentivise things like cinemas by granting them some sort of development fund money etc.  A) The building itself will create jobs B) the amenities will make young people less likely to leave C) the things built once open will create jobs D) the places where those were built will become a local center of live where other businesses will be more interested to settle  I live in a large city which has been crumbling for a while, when we got a cinema again young people moving away became notably less. And that's just one cinema, if we had any other places for free-time possibilities it would only enhance the effect, but our local government basically went "good enough" and stopped looking into that demographic problem, I'm not a teenager anymore but I'm honestly considering moving into a town with a tenth of our population simply because you can actually go outside and meet people there with them having a disco and two youth-centers as well as a cinema
10 minutes to explain that this area is mostly agricultural land reserve. Your last few videos were good. This one is just pure filler.
How many Corollas vs Peugeots are in the diagonal?
Why "fix" it?
Dude why would you recognize Palestine in a video, you're going to get so much hate just from that haha.
Palestine is NOT a state!
I love how in the extension of the empty diagonal through spain, the area literally contains Madrid. I think spain has a lot of emptiness as well, but it's more circular around the capital, as opposed to diagonally through it
What you totally forget when you compare France to Germany is eastern Germany.
As a country boy through and through , let em head to the city. I've been to many cities and don't get it. I am physically incapable of living like that, the less people the better. Yes, I do live in a impoverished area with no future prospects, but No I'm never gonna leave. My home is here in the mountains watching the woods retake the abandoned houses.
France looks like a left hand
“State of Palestine” might raise some controversy
I think it is good to have areas with low population density. There can't only be urban sprawl you need both rural areas and urban areas. I don't really understand why the French government is acting like this is a problem.
I live in Hungary, which had a population of 9,7 million people in 2020 and 1,7 million of them lived in Budapest, the capital city. The second largest is Debrecen with only 211 340 people. Sometimes it feels like everyone is living in Budapest. :D
Europe keep going on making your people work and work more and more sometimes 2 or more jobs not having time to make children and then flood your continent with non europeans that actually have time to make children because they dont work which in turn makes europeans have to work MORE so they can afford living with rising costs since more people that dont work = the ones that do work have to pay for everyones social security, health insurance and etc... someone has to pay the taxes for the flood right? Also more people that get money from the state means the ones that actually work have to pay higher rents in the cities. Since more people = more demand = increased price and ONLY the workers actually pay with their hard earned money.  The idiocy in this is beyond me.
If you think the centralization of France in Paris Metropolitan Area is bad at one fifth of the population...I want you to know that nearly 1/3 of whole Croatian population lives in Zagreb Metropolitan Area - about 1.2 million out of 3.8 million total. Its absurd!
The most widely regarded scarcely populated department in France by French people, is the Creuse, with a significant proportion of it's population living in a single city
Why is it called a diagonal? It is a foot. The toes are in Belgium.
I live in this region 💀
This makes me want to move to rural France.
Could You do one on Poland and it's population? The impact of partitions and WW2 and the mass migration resulting in Poland being on of the most homogeneous countries in Europe...and what current Ukrainian refugee situation might mean for Poland's population
Sounds like a city boy can't stand people living in the country
I live in Lozere and in this department there are more cows (or sheep) than inhabitants
“Most people live in the near of a coastline”  Madrid: things are different here Señor
1/6 of all Canadians live in the greater Toronto area and almost half live in Ontario. Canada is way emptier than that place.
>why is 1/3 of France Empty?  Only 10% of Canada is populated
dude why does nobody talk about china? the east is extremely populated and the west has nothing.
When this "empty diagonal" has a higher population density than my country 😭
As someone from Wyoming, empty spaces are filled with beauty instead of pavement and people.
It’s like Swiss cheese, there are void like holes in that population density
More people live near the coast who would have thought
Comment
8th best funded military. Those white flags are expensive
Love my frogs
the great city of condom lies in this area
L'Hexagone is the bestagone!
"One of the world's most significant countries"   X to doubt.  ratio + fell off + commie + no longer even french + white flag
Have you seen sweden?
Grape farms 😂
Mountains?
A waste of time
I get it, I wouldn't want to be in France either
RRL: "this diagonal of sparse population even continues to Spain"  Madrid: "am I a joke to you?"
This same phenomenon is happening in Finland too. After high school young people generally move to the big cities in south of the country for education or job and the rural areas become even more rural. For example in 1994 Lapland's population was around 200 000 inhabitants whereas today the number is closer to 178 000 and big part of those people live in more populated areas such as Rovaniemi and Kemi. And bear in mind that third of Finland's land area belongs to Lapland but only 3% of the country's population live here. Crazy!
Almost half the states in the U.S. have the same population density or less as this area of France.  If you calculated it by area, it would be far more than half of the U.S.
probably in case Germany ever wanted to invade Spain, then France would let them pass through there.
It doesn’t help that large parts of the northern section are uninhabitable because of the wars.
What's the big deal. Over 1/2 of the United States isn't populated
Based for acknowledging the state of Palestine
How is a lot of the geography empty I thought France was the most visited in the world
this video took way too long to get to the point
Ce n’est pas vide on préfère dire faibles densités parce que il y a des personnes et des activités bien qu’elles soient peu nombreuses :)
I'm laughing so much when you're saying french words
hey france more looks like a pentagon than a hexagon ngl
Less vs. Fewer Learn it. Love it.
Even France's population density surrendered. Goodness.
Hello
What is this ‘state of Palestine’ you speak of?
Turkey entered the chat
btw who asked?
Lozère is indeed comparable to Palestine: it doesn't exist
all of europe is facing these demographic problems and sadly it's become this really crazy political problem one thing the government could do is promote procreation instead of bashing it constantly and then it complains about the demographics and then the response is to bring in immigrants which the vast majority of europeans don't support but what they want doesn't seem to matter really
Cool video
Who calls France L'Hexagone? 😂
it only serves as a buffer between eastchads and westcels
Well....I'd highly doubt that France is one of the world's most significant countries lol
2:45 thats not the full map of Palestine. Palestine 🇵🇸 is originally 27027 km wide, with a population of more that 12 million Palestinian and roughly the same are refugees living in diaspora. its occupied by the Zionist entity known as israel and one day will be free!
Keep the empty diagonal, we dont need more french
This reminds me of ¨La España vaciada¨ (The empty Spain). It´s a similar issue/topic, and also very interestiing!
"Demographic shift from the country to the cities is a global phenomenon." I disagree. It WAS a phenomenon - however, with pandemic, potential global wars looming, economies threatening to collapse AND the advent of remote working due to the advent of the internet, Zoom conferences, etc - people can work from anywhere.  While cities offer the culture of museums, theatre, restaurants etc.... those attributes of a city have been decimated by the pandemic - and people have come up with alternative ways of entertaining themselves - many of which involve connecting with nature. This makes the idea of owning a little land in the country very appealing. Add low inventory on shelves, GMO's, seed soverignty into the mix, a Farm to Table craze - it's all a perfect storm for populations moving back into the country and simplifying.  Trends are towards minimalism not consumerism.
We usually don't leave in the Empty Diagonal because the wifi is really bad in there.
I live there. Pretty quiet
Meanwhile in Egypt, literally 95% of the entire country is an empty desert.
I recognize myself to this video so much. As a French young person (20) who had grown in this diagonal, my wish going out of high school was to study in Environmental sciences. There was only one university in that diagonal that could offer that chance. I had chosen to take an other one : further, but let's say socially more active, I was fed up with just going out to do the same things, to not discover new people and new ways of thinking, etc... and I don't regret it in the way like it seems in this "void area" nothing changes, same problems in an extended timeline.  But I wouldn't go directly in that conclusion of the loop. It doesn't work like this cause it can rely on the breadth of your attachment to your territory, something which sparsely exists there and over all your job/ studies : mine were linked with tertiary sector, and that one requires high-developed web/mixes of investments, technologies, people and buildings.  Out of the people (of course) this diagonal suffers from lacks in at least one of these other requirements and that's an issue that comes from our government.  However, the agriculture and especially the industry need less these combinations and this is only what remains in that area with the people who get along with these kind of jobs. This avoids to completely fill out the diagonal.
F*ck city life…. Out in the forrest is my haven!
My country BD with a density of 1100+
I guess we need some land for farming and nature reserves.
Subscribed
Poland has a similiar problem where the East is rural and sparsly populated while the West is very urban and dense
isnt all of france an empty void
Name a city in France that isn't Paris.     See 👀
It's a shame France has become so weak.
Thank you R.L.L ,I am not a french so i didn't knew that.
I dunno, this video strikes me as not really answering the question. His answer is urbanization and people live by the coast??? Like what? Terrible answer. No reference to the Massif Central. Also, why are the borders drawn like that??? Are they confined by some geographical, historical, or cultural feature? Literally just made a line ignoring cities like Bordeaux and Toulouse lol. Hate to say it, but this video is trash.
Here is some curious information:  95% of the Philippine's population only live in around 15 of their 7000+ islands
Looks like the problem in Spain is even worse, except for Madrid, there is nobody living in the interior parts of the country. A video on this will be appreciated
literally never heard france referred to as l'hexagone
@reallifelore  Why isn't this video on nebula?  Isn't the whole point of paying extra for Nebula is to get access to all your content, ad-free, plus exclusives.  If this video is only available on youtube, doesn't that miss the point?  Seems like a rip-off.
I live in diagonal. I moved here from the UK 2 years ago. It's wonderful. There is life here, and a lot of young French people are now into eco-living and are leaving the cities for the countryside, to grow their own veg or pursue artisanal crafts. But, yes, there are a LOT of old people.
Lived most of my life in this zone lol
You said the P word
0:00 Why? Because you ignored Toulouse.
i just kept thinking of the Midwest in America lol
France looks more like a star to me in shape
You said France is the 8th most powerful but its 7th, 8th is the United Kingdom.
Make a video about Turkeys uncertain future.
As a geography freak I love your videos! Keep that way please!!
Their military is 8th. Lol why would you do France dirty by mentioning that
I live in this diagonal. It's also because the immigration mainly went to the cities' suburbs.
Ahahah
Can you belive,  this is taught in India too even if it doesn't have to do anything with us
The rural brain drain is really a problem almost everywhere, not just in France.
brb moving to Lozere 😈
Large cities tend to follow great rivers or being close to the see. There is no mystery why Fenace interior has lower population density than the cost. The same thing happens in every country in the world.
The Ruling Powers Really Want People To Move to The City, More Control, It's Happening In The U.S. But Not As Much, people still want to live outside The Box, Thank You Real Life Lore And love your Channel!
wtf are you guys talking about, hey les français sur le chat vous allez les laissée dire de la merde comme ça? alright first you do notice that there are some quite big cities in that area that it is not unpopulated it's just happens that none of them is part of the "very big cities" of france (witch some are carefully avoided cus if u count toulous and bordeau like you did in miniature ur calcule don't work no more the average ppl per area comes back much closer to the national average...),
Slow demography week? Next up: the Great Plains of North America?
Sounds like the place to move to for your retirement!!
Cities suck
We call this "la diagonale du vide" "The empty diagonal"  Lmaoooe you said it
At 7:50 the video shows how Spain has the same demograpic issue down the middle of its country as well with one major exception… Madrid. Y’all should do a video explaining how Madrid ended up being Spains largest city in middle of nowhere. That’s the real anomaly.
i love that you actually used the aave conjugated ”be” meme correctly
Countries aren't allowed to have countryside now? Every country has countryside, you could do this for just about any country that's not fully sardine canned.
I think the real question is "Why is ONLY 1/3rd of France is Almost Empty" Gotta pump that number up. I think 100% of France being empty would make the world a better place.
4:18 France seems more masculine to me
*1/3 rd of France is empty* *Me as an Indian : "Interesting"*
The area near the Spanish border gets very windy.  I remember that from being there as a kid.
palestine is not a state
very interesting video thank you as always
Don't look at Canada ... it's worse, just about 4 and 1/4 Canadians per sq kms
0:47 I see a shirt
OK but this could be the same for a lot of countries. USA for example.
With farming, a lack profit has lead to a lack of people which has lead to increased automation, not the other way around
France's shape is clearly more similar to a pentagon rather than a hexagon. Well maybe the extra size is just them trying to make themselves seem superior by lying or living in denial, as always 😂😂
cause french people hate it there
Is that where the first 15 minutes of Ratatouille take place?
I live in this empty diagonal, but still am around one hour away from Paris suburbs, so it's pretty weird to be this close from the capital but still living in a small town in the middle of nowhere
No one wants to live near Belgium and Spain
So.... skip to then end where you say is agricultural.
It's too bad in World War II that they got decimated. They were the biggest army in Europe at that time, and the Germans went through them like a hot knife through butter. Why ? Seriously, does anyone have an answer to that ? Not being critical, just wondering how that could happen?
The empty diagonal is 7.5 times more populated than Canada.
Is it a low density within the diagonal? Or is the rest of Europe really density? At one point it is said that the diagonal is same as Virginia. Ok... cool. I could still use less people
lol wait until you hear about all the empty space in Canada
you totally need to talk about spains population density. the issue is way bigger than in france, being that almost the entire population lives either in the coast or in madrid in the center, leaving a huge ring around madrid where many parts are called "la españa vacía", literally the empty spain. take a look at it it's very interesting
"Nearly identical in size to India"   Are you sure?
3:29 "Demography is destiny" is one of the favorite quotes of presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.
I guess its L'hexaGONE
No such state as Palestine, and it's population is way less than 5 milion. Get your facts straight.
After watching this I'm actually more interested in knowing why Spain has basically no one living in it
“Belaroos”
2:44 based
Meanwhile in Russia...
France🤮
you should make videos like this for other countries too
The most of the USA's pupalation dont know where is france
Ehhh... incorrect fact at 0:10. France: 640,000 km2, India: 3.2 million km2 i.e. roughly 1:5 proportions.
Franci-stan 🇫🇷 is the Greatest Country in da World 🌎🌍🌏 :) All tho I am not from Franci-stan 🇫🇷 I love Franci-stan 🇫🇷 from Türan Qazaqstan 🇰🇿 :).

Man you're really gonna get fucked up when you hear about middle America.

2:28 :  Some clarification here: Those 18 regions are including overseas departments. In reality, metropolitan French territory comprises only 13 regions - and that, including the island of Corsica; their overall number having been drastically reduced from the original 22 ones since a big overhaul with lots of merging in 2016.
"8th best  funded military" is misleading, it's got nothing on china or the US...
"people actually do be living in cities" lol
I am from Reunion island, a french overseas territory of France, between 1963 and 1982, France stole, kinapped children in Reunion to repopulate this empty diagonal. They took advangtage that most of people couldn't read back then, telling parents they children will get back to them.  "Some were adopted, others stayed in homes or served as slave labor on the farms; the peasants across the Creuse then using them as handymen or workers without wages"
As in ancient times it looks like the cities and the coastlines are where the populations are going to be. Also riverheads.
Easy solution, build big city, no water?, build big canal
In Spain the 80% of the people live in the 20% of the space 🙄
Of course nobody wants to live in Fr*nce 🤢
There is no state of Palestine, there never has been.
Funnily enough, the country I live in is famous for its beautiful countryside. For untamed areas of wilderness and vast stretches of rural landscape. Alot of our tourism industry is built on exactly that . . . Thing is, the reason its so empty is because 83% of our population lives in urban areas.   11% live in what's termed 'accessible rural' areas   And just 6% in 'remote rural' areas.  Essentially we have a 'central belt' where maybe a little over half the population lives and then a couple of cities and several significant towns stretching north up our east coast. That's it really. The largest place in our 'highlands' is a city with a population of about 50,000  The second largest settlement in the region barely reaches 10,000 inhabitants.
Demographics, this is the reason the UK is probably one of if not the most successful influential country of the last 1000 years no place is more than 200 miles from the sea, its surrounded by water on all sides and is the perfect base for launching military ships and trade expeditions conquering and colonising much of the known and unknown world creating a base for scientific innovation commercialisation. France and Britain have until recently ( odd squabbles aside ) have been at each others throats for most of the last 800 years
I swear I can't take geography facts seriously after watching so much of Drew Durnil
France 🤢🤮
Why wouldn't we consider investing into careers and jobs that can be worked remotely.  Helps raise families which helps birth rates and spreads out the population because you don't need to live near a major city for work.
You know, in today's standard, 1.9 million French men who died, feminist and gender "scholars" will write articles about how women are most affected.
You know, previously I thought France and Germany should in theory be equal in strength, but then I found out that Germany's population density is more or less double of the French one.  It seems like flat farmlands + wars can have big effects. I have a friend from Russia that described the country as a bunch of nothingness and big cities. Reminds me of this a bit
Frans was considered to be the most advanced country in the world from 16 to 19 century.
Good
Because on these elds white flags are stamped
Youtuber is shocked to learn of population density 😮
Nothing compared to my shit hole of home state of New Jersey, "In 2018, the population density of New Jersey stood at 1,211.3 residents per square mile of land area." Not even sq kilometer.  Im sure its probably over 1,500 if everyone actually did their census properly, which with all the immigrants they do not. "The estimated 2015 population of New Jersey was 8,904,413 " Wonder what the new census will say. I hate it here, way to many people, its literally the living area for people who work in NYC and Philly. It also has one of the biggest drug issues and amounts of drug dealers plus because of its huge ports, so much of the drugs come through here.
do asocial people love to be in this area?
Sounds like the best part of France.
Last i checked there was something there. It was a highway.
So France's population is decreasing
The video does well to identify that this region exists, but at the beginning says that it is some sort of problem.  The rest of the video fails to point out how or why this would be a problem, and in fact, does the opposite.  It's an agricultural area and mechanization means fewer people are needed to produce the food, so fewer people live in this region.  Where is the problem?
It’s like the dakotas. Most of the population lives in the east and it’s empty in the west.
State of Palestine? lmao. Liberland is more real than that
Laughs in rural Manitoba
There is no "State of Palestine."   That country is Israel.
is that the woodsy part they use for filming peste noire videos?
Fun fact, the département of La Creuse, on of the lowest populated, was so barren that in the 60's, the government had to abduct children from our overseas islands as an attempt to repopulate it.
I live in a province in Canada that is 650,000km² and has a population density of 2 people per km². 75% of the population lives in one city and we only have two cities with over 50k population. I live in one of the lesser dense rural areas where the population per km² is probably less than 0.1 people.   Yet I have internet service, all regular amenities and am fully able to live my entire life in this desolate place. I've been to NYC and Mexico City, and my family are very well traveled across the globe. Still blows my mind how many people live in some of the densest areas of the planet.
at least france does not name there cities northern fartington
You should do a similar video for Spain that has an even bigger problem with empty areas
Can you please make a video on India as it's highest population density is only in small areas of the country
WHY DOES HE SAY BELARUS LIKE THAT
another poggers video
"Wyoming of France"
Spain has the exact same problem, people migrate to the cities and the countryside is underpopulated, just like you showed in the map.
Actually the French education system is trying to rename it from "diagonale du vide" (the devoid diagonal) to "diagonale de faible densite" (low density diagonal). It's kind of funny how they don't want to offend the people living there, but we do, like the comment below says.
you should do another video about the similar phenomenon in spain
I think you should take a look at Norway compared to other European countries. It's been trying to avoid centralization for most of its 20th century history. I think it's a very unique topic not often talked about.
The first time in my nearly 50 years as a European that I’ve ever heard of France being referred to as L’hexagone.
Palestine is a territory, not a state
Agricultural area not close to the coast. got it. You definitely didn't NEED 11mins for that. Just milking eh.
All I know about France is they say “we, we, we”.
As someone from the US most of Europe seems crowded to me.
0:06 France is 4th most populated country in Europe. Not 3rd
lol cuz ludwig knows french
Forget school and main stream media... I get all my information here. Literally, here.
Even if the french army would be the best financed in the world it would surrender on the 1st day of any war.
Tbh I don’t get this video like ya there’s parts of France that have less people
0:52 don't see france being a hexagon, it's shaped more like Patrick from spongebob to me
Nice!! Love your channel!! Another Banger!
France's population is an inch larger than the UK's, just to say…
Maybe I'll retire to Buttfuck Nowhere, France.
The instant I heard 'The State of Palestine', I unsubscribed...There is no such 'state'.
It's simple.Croissant occupies 1/3rd of the land
So what's your problem ? STFU and move along.
I thought it was m t not empty
I got the 1000 like
1000
will be stuffed with refugees soon.
Maybe you can only realize you live in France if you leave in that third? Everyone in that third would just leave and move to the other 2/3 thinking they had escaped?
I just discovered this channel about 2 weeks ago. Been massively bingeing this and Half as Interesting. Really dig it. Much love. 💜
11:01
Imagine waking up and realizing you're f*rench 🤢
Hello French people! 👋
I've never heard someone pronounce "Belarus" that way
Wait until you hear about (S)pain
I love this channel.
Okay we have some flaws. Still far better than everyone tho
2/3 of the country surrendered, and this 1/3 fled?
Hi
I thought this was gonna bring up the overseas territories like French Guiana, Kerguelen, and Mayotte.
How am I this esrly
I always thought that Le Havre was spelled differently.
"Why 1/3 of France is mostly empty" Greenland: *How cute*
Loved your presentations for years and continue to do so!   👏👏👍👍😊 Yours truly from Leeds - West Yorkshire in the UK🇬🇧
Do a video of somalia islamic history
as someone from the netherlands most of europe seems pretty empty to me.
doesn't "1/3rd" become "one thirdrd"? lol
What are the best things to do in France? 1/3rd of it's people: Leave
Yes
Every french high school student learns about this empty diagonal in Geography class, and we love to make fun of those who live in it.
Look at it through a drinking glass and it's two thirds full. 😎
because Russia
Censoring comments I see. Interesting...
Because tony Learns from his mistake

What's Palestine? bruh
can you tell me why turks dead sea is dying
Yes L'hexagone, I've totally heard France called this before.
First time I’ve caught a videos a couple minutes after it uploaded
The philosophy hank inside me is starting to ask "but what IS empty?"
Imagine being french lmfao
France <
I am still trying to learn French
Palestine isn’t real. Unsub and dislike.
Hahahahaha franch
France surrendered in ww2
Ouo oui bread bread

The first part is true except for the french, they think they live in hell
Meanwhile napoleon in heaven…

Get my comment on top for no reason! Go!!!
Can you make video why Western US is drier and hotter then Eastern US ??
2:45 Palestine hasnt been a thing for a long time.
Ayo I'm liking the back to back videos nowadays!
Any body here? :)))
KEKW
I really thought this video would've been about French Guyana (which is of course just a part of France)
Can I get a pin?
France used to be 70% empty back in the 50's.
Yesss yesss we love you made this yess
