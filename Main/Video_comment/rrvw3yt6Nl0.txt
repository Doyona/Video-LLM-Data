Kyrgious has no emotional control and it costs him often. Behaving like a petulent immature adult.
Amazing, well done Nick ja 👏🎾❤️
11:40  Bloody close.
Couldn't include the year huh? Trash ripped stolen upload
This is the reincarnation of the Safin Roddick battle
D'Angelo Russel randomly chillin there at 1:59
Love Daniil !!!!!
When Nick is focused he's a boss . Fabulous player 👍🏻
Hes an abject failure for squandering slams
Aunque a muchos no les agrade, el nivel y calidad de Kyrgios es otro nivel
Very strong player but an aggressive personality. This is why he will never be a true champion.
What a clown
Every player should have right to play under her/his country's flag. One cannot choose the country of one's birth. WTA/ATP/ITF, stop this nonsense and do not mix sport with politics.  Appointing "flag police" at the AO 2023 was not even childish... it was embarassing and insane...  Wars are run by politicians not sportsmen/sportswomen. Why during the invasion of Iraq, 20 year bombing of Afghanistan not to mention the genocidal Vietnam war US, Australian, UK... athletes were allowed to compete under their national flag? USA invaded Iraq in 2003 and yet their flag was still allowed at the World Cup 2006 in Germany and 2010 in South Africa despite the fact they were still in Iraq. Either ban ALL flags of countries who go to war, or don't ban any of them.   Another example; are Israeli (Para-)olympians responsible for the policy of their government towards Palestinians? * All wars are equal, but some wars are more equal than others.
Россия-лучшая!!!
This is one match i rooted for Kygrios to win
Hace FALTA NICK 👌
there is WAY too much communication from Kyrgios's box... he demands it of them...on every point it seems
this was Kyrgios US Open
Kyrgios is one of most talented players in tennis.
Um Time Break que vi que mais durou foi de Zverev
Medvedev the BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Who were all the people in NK's box? Besides girlfriend and trainer, brother etc
Bravo Upload.. 2023 - Wish List..  D.M Wins AO.. Casper Ruud Wins French Open.. Nicholas Wins Wimbledon.. Felix Wins US Open..
2 tall guys putting up a show. Not like old generation of serve bots
Kyrgios has issuses
I don't know how Kyrgios walks with those big balls after this tie break.
A crap program
🥊🦘🦘🦘🥊Nicky!
Super tibreak
190
That volley from Kyrgios at set point down actually determined the winner of the tournament imo
2 times racket throwing, 1 time verbal abuse. 0 warning?
Well done Nick Aussie Aussie oi oi oi ❤ 🎾
Kyrgios has really worked on his forehand it is much stronger. ❤ 🎾 ❤ 🎾 ❤ 🎾 ❤ 🎾
Long live Russian Russia 💯💯💯💯💯
mans said "tell me when to serve" like bruh thats coaching LOL
Kyrgios is the biggest talent since Federer, in terms of shot making. But by God he needs to sort his head out!
And then he goes and loses to the 27 seed. Tough loss....
Crowded full house wow. USA loveing nick. Meds good to. I call him the silent 🐻 carnt believe nick beat him. But lost. Today mach .great to cee nick not getting as angry with his salf. Big up nick. And med ..great mach. I was on talking tennis with cam Willam s channle. 👍🙂🤩. Lisaning to this mach. 👏👏👏👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽.
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, neglect, cruelty or starvation. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. None of us are righteous, perfect or good (any human who claims that is untruthful with you)  we have all sinned before God. Everyday we make mistakes and everyday we sin in word, thought, action and deed, but God loved us so much that he look past our frail human nature and our failures and loved us and wanted to save us anyway despite  the fact we could never be good or righteous on our own merit.  Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
the little greek boy will never win any majors!!
Gosh Hes so Good But such a brat ... comeon Nick ...
Ruska tylko po chamsku.
Ruska pluskwa
Confidence was low, therefore nailed a couple of drop shots. 👍
Why do they bother to  use and pay commentators?  Never anything insightful just stating the obvious?
Why Danya played last point so bad?! Sad.
Kyrgios is a gifted tennis player, however, he needs the metal toughness fortitude to be great.  Altough the big 3 are not getting younger in Federer, Nadal, Novak, these 3 would easily beat by letting him beat himself.  He's definatley entertaining, but it takes more than being gifted to be great.  His crazy style reminds me of the cro-acing Goran. Time will tell as he's only 27.  With Novak not getting vaccinated and RAFA looking old, the doors are open on the mens side. This champion is for Kyrgios to lose.
Medvedev should NOT BE PLAYING IN THE US OPEN PERIOD! All Russians and Nazis in the Kremlin must be removed from Ukraine. We do NOT want Russian athletes competing in any sport world wide. THEY NEED TO BE BANNED PERIOD! We must remember the civilians and the children that the Nazis are targeting and bombing in churches, schools and hospitals. Bravo Kyrgios. Bravo Ukraine. Long live Ukraine. On to the final Kyrgios. Fight for the children of Ukraine.
Kyrgios is ready to experiment new styles,I guess having no coach is kind of Plus for him
Medvedev needs to add more tricks to his arsenal of shots. He mainly just sits back returning all balls and a lot of times pushing them back. Once he hit a talent like Kirgios he has no chance.
This was the true finals, f everything else :(
no warnings for swearing and smashing raquettes. great job umpire.
I have to say I am not happy to have to see more of Kyrgios and his bad behaviour
Kyrgios makes the best shots when he’s filled with adrenaline due to his short fuse. Still don’t want to be in his shoes though
But 2 racquet throws … where are the code violations?
Elsker at se youtube
Strange camera angle, or is this a new sorta setup?
What an epic tie break! Both players were tense and couldn't let it go away! And then Kyrgios finally shook it up with two incredible drop shots!
Incredible tie break.  Both players were spectacular but those drop shots were pure art.  Kyrgios just needs to stop throwing his racket like a mini Mcenroe.
Both can beat anyone in the world when in form.
This tie-break is like a full episode of a thriller TV show. Unbelievable stuff.
Nick he is very lucky not to represent North Korea !!!, other ways he would be sent to a re - education camp for his behavior !! Mate change your behavior you represent Australia !!
wait he really didnt get a code violation for throwing his racket or at least a warning?
11:34 That precision in the outside edge of the line and to do it on defending set point of a tie break. If the racket head was just a bit heavier it might had been out
It’s hard to believe Kyrgios doesn’t have a coach yet he’s able to tactically work out his own game strategy against Medvedev, and then being able to change it up during the match after he lost the 2nd set. Kyrgios is such a talented and exciting player to watch, he’s great for tennis. I really hope he wins it all. Go Nick!
So glad you won Nick keep it up
Duelazo, Medvedev incapaz de demostrar la supremacia de un numero 1, va para abajo en el ranking. Kyrgios se luce cada vez mas, parece que va madurando y eso se refleja en su juego, menos locuras, mejores resultados
If rankings were based on talent he would be in top 2 or 3 players on the tour the only Federer has that shot making ability
How well his racket can take those beating...I am switching to Yonex...Lol!
They need to fine players who toss their rackets $1000
N.K is droping bombs...atomic bombs eheheheh
King kyrgios!!
Даня даня даня 2 раз подряд проигрываешь Кирьгиосу. Что  с тобой.
It is so much better without line referees. No challenges, no frustrations.
I don’t know how Kyrgios walks around with them giant set of balls.
Come back Roger- (we miss you).
Quelle Force de mental chez les 2 joueurs !!!! Et quel Tennis, c'est Énnnnnorme  !!!!! Kyrgios allie dans son jeu puissance et magie techniquement maîtrisée dont ce fameux amorti croisé est une des apothéose !!! C'est juste Fabuleux,
Tennis is a game of how to make a winner rather than how to hit a ball. Kyr shows it.
What a crybaby 😪 😢 😫
why was there no racket abuse call by the referee?
Yeeeeees
The drop shot at 11-11 was ridiculous. No other player in the world would have attempted such a low percentage shot and risky shot.
Absolutley box office
On this this clip we can see that Nick REALLY needs his crew to cheer for him, he really needs that energy coming from its corner. He doesn't ask it in a very elegant way but hey, they know him so, I guess that's the way it works.  Go Nick, I hop you gonna lift that bloody trophy !!!
The way he fine tune his racket by throwing it on the ground was his secret
Wow
gran tenista y cretino mayúsculo también
Well don’t Nick
Ladies and gentlemen, in front of you the Kyrgios Special
Epic indeed!
Truly an Epic Tie-Break! I'm thrilled! Two Great Great Players! Well done both o' ya! Congratulations Nick! 😊👍
My favourite after Roger.
kygs
The two drop shots toward the end of the tie break were just absolutely amazing
he's just so good
