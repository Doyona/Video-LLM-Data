Beautiful.   /Cheers from SWEDEN
Would it have been more efficient to use a good sized dozer like a d6 to carve and roll the hillside over rather than 1000 swings and digs with the ex? Not criticizing and you couldn’t deal with the trees the same way or pull the rock up but rolling material over is what they are built to do.
The first was a 25% grade the second drive was 14% . In my county I could not get a building permit if it over 11% unless I pave it.
How are you going to get the new machine back to your place?
Great base for a road. It reminds me a lot of my property in Atlantic Canada. Very nice job!
Good luck to the owner getti g up yhat in the winter...

Bro, how does he get this equipment? So cheap.
Nice usage of those parallelpiped , natural stones/boulders as a wall on the edge of the driveway!
Euclid and Pythagoras come in handy sometimes. ;)
لوکیشن کجاست این ایالت؟؟؟
Love the work sir. Great job 👏 👍 👌
Andrew is that a new skin steer
If you want to get a job done you definitely need good tools. Unfortunately it's often only possible if you buy newer tools or spend a lot money fixing the old stuff
Wonder how a decent sized dozer would do ?
Ever heard of the formula to find percentage of slope?
''''''''''''''''''''
One of the many benefits of being a popular YouTuber. 🔥
Cheer~~~a person who removes earth carefully and systematically from an archaeological site in order to find buried remains.(good information)😊
Curious..  now that the natural hillside is tore up..  is there any concern for erosion over time due to heavy rains???
All day Andrew !!
Took me so long too find these videos again! My ADHD is now at peace. ♥️
Nice work!  What's something like that gonna run a property owner?
👍😎👍
That machine is stable as it gets when its ripping
You don’t use a laser to maintain your rise over run?
Some really high-tech drones, I mean, come on recording in 30 fps and 4k video
What drone is that?
😮

And this Hyundai burns to the ground about a year after buying it……
Seems like great videos to get baked and fall asleep too. Realizing and interesting at the same time
You need bulldozer here
Working with a ghost rip to the Hyundai
Andrew did a good job!! I’m not hating at all but…… it’s wild how just a few states away they do things so much differently! We don’t mix all the organics into our dirt! Although this was like a shale rock! We still do things alil diffrent here in the mtns of NC and the. Totally diffrent in the upstate SC!
Came back here to pay respects to the girl. At least no one was hurt except the wallet.
Fast forward 1 year! ..she's no more! Up in smoke! Rip Hyundai!
sihma
RIP Excavator
Can we get a link to the drones used in the video???
that's  a  nice  machine   but  i   would  have  thought  you  needed  a  cat  bulldozer  for  that  job
Andrew has a wonderful vision of what he wants to end up with and how to get there, love seeing Cody and Blue enjoying life.
boo
This video didn't age well lol
Well as of today this machine caught on fire
Where is this?  Looks like Catskills rock?
Andrew is living the American Dream !
It is shame you don't want to make it big on youtube and make more money. TIP: Never use music, except for transtions. If you must do a speed up video, then use voice over. You ask why not to use music, 30+% of your viewers are not even watching the video, they are listening only, and when they hear prolong music( more than 3 seconds), they will change the video. Your choice. By becoming more professional, you will get longer view times and more viewers.
Díky!
You really got a lot of fire- and "dog"-wood.......    🙂
What are you using on the skid steer? It looks tiny but it seems to be doing a lot of grappling. I couldn't tell because of the fast motion.
Those are not rocks, they are mudfossils from the flood of noah
Thank you for sharing so many details about your equipment
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Just 1 note: bring a chain next time and you can drag those trees up and out of the way much more easily.  Great video 😊
Very clever to get the measurements from the drones. It's hard to get accurate measurements over long distances but the gps is very handy there, and accurate too.
seeing a digger scrape away at the earth brings me back to when I was a boy.  My dad used to take me to the case dealership or local construction sites so I could watch.The guys that ran that place knew me and would let me sit in the machines and come into the office and collect brochures.
could you add a blade to this  excavator, with out too much truble and expence?
My husband and I are big fans of yandrews videos we've been looking for new ones every day are you not doing videos anymore? Hope all is well with you and not have been injured
They make a tilt meter app for your phone that will give you the localized slope. Always fun watching the videos. I have learned a lot from Andrew. I have a back hoe now and I get a lot of use out of it.
So much easier to just buy excavators and have them shipped to the job instead of moving them LOL! Great vid as always!
like all the room at the top, well dunn  as  always
Andrew using Pythagoras mathematics.
Nice new machine
When will people learn music always runs the video
SANFORD that drive is as steep as the other one was
SANFORD will have this machine looking it was 100 years old in no time the way he abuses machinery lololololol
💪💪💪
Nice landscape, a x4 wheeler must have! Wood was a bonus. Could not believe the quality of the flat shingle/stone you found, would have sold here in Sweden for a good price, just the right thickness for paths, steps, ponds and any decoration. At least you saved the two large boulders, beautiful 90 degree on them too. Would have had them stacked with the name on them at the turn off. Your digger was very impressive, can take on some stump removal jobs with that. Thanks for the insight. What drone were you using, DJI AIR 3 right? very stable footage and am thinking of getting one atm. Keep safe.
Sheeeitt boy …what y’all do efter lunch?…
Nice work
I just witnessed a flaw in your road building you put organic material down and covered it up with dirt when it rots it well create a cavity and fall in. other then that you done a good 👍
What are you doing with these rocks?😊
👋👍
Whaaat 71 thousand dollars?
Congrsts on the new beast ...diffidently this machine is a game changer.for sure this driveway needs a lot of improvement things like widening it more and lay a cush rocks in top of it and so forth .job well done as usual and good luck with the new excavator...chiao
Buy a clinometer, Sunto makes a nice hand held one. Great for shooting quick grades. It will show %grade and degrees.
What a phenomenal job of visualizing and then building what you envisioned ! 💪Props buddy! 👍
perimiter shock collars on dogs? they take too much time...
Are all those trees dead, it looks like a fire waiting to happen. I think after the road goes in some serious logging is a smart choice to get rid of all that dead wood .
A cat  would of made short work out of putting in this driveway.
It’s a good thing that he bought it with a tooth bucket otherwise he wouldn’t be able to dig through the rocks on that hillside with a smooth bucket
you have a lot of dead forest in the area where you live. can you just dig such roads when it suits? here in Norway, there are months of applications if you want to put a spade in the ground, even in your own driveway.
I'm thinking he really  loves his work and may love doing these types of jobs more than getting paid for them.
why no shield? isn't that basic on all excavators? would have made especially that job MUCH more easy!
Would love this kinda work what a great environment to work in well done fella
Andrew it cracks me up that you get in this big excavator and still operate it like a mini lol. You need a Kobelco ED160BR-7. It is the biggest excavator made that still has a blade and it's a legit huge 6-way dozer blade. I could see you being extremely efficient with it.
I say it is all the time technology today is no joke hello
I'm from germany and I would love to go selfemployed with an excavator like this. But over here they say you have to run the machine for 250 paid hours per month at least to make it pay. Which doesn't sound like a good deal to me
It seems like it was just yesterday when I watched some of your very first podcast. You've come a long way pilgrim and I must have missed a video or two because I see you've got a new acquisition which looks like it's a 235 and it handled those nice address stones or guard rails quite well! Thanks bunches for bringing us on your journey
POZDRAWIAM SERDECZNIE . SUPER  .
Just needs to be leveled up with some base materials so it fills in the hollows and let it get rolled then leave it to get driven on for some time then just give it a quick once over roll and put only a thin dressing of gravel found that easyest way of putting only
Basically a culvat
Those long rocks would be perfect for a bridge pleased side by side lengthways over a ditçh
Skills about everything! I am like many other viewers impressed about your work and attitude. And great filming and editing again.
I love the videos so much I'm starting to love the man who makes them.
Your videos are getting great 👍 👌 take care my friend.
Love it love it love it   Great work Andy , more vidios  buddy , beats uk TV  any day
Do you guys have permission to destroy the forest and its floor  Its so much disgusting to see that you guys are destroying our lovely forests
ANDREW YOUR BEST IN WHAT EVER YOU DO BOBBY BRX
71 hundred ? 71 thousand?
Your lucky you dont need to get the rock breaker out
I was looking at that rock poking out thinking dam im gunna hav 2 scrape that as well to cut it in properly 🙄 but its haaaaaaard 😆😆
Muss denn wirklich so viel beschissene Werbung sein?
NJqq1q
Nice work!  Where in the country is this?  Somewhere in the west (guessing from what is that - shale?)?
Spirit,strong 💪
Is that wistling diesel ranch
How many days ? And cost to do this much work ?
14:40 thats a nice rock
I for one love watching the destruction of nature to make things more convenient for people. 10/10 no notes
Very cool! 👍👍
Nice machine dude. Saving to get my own one day
How many hours on that excavate as you are saying it's new
You should start a sawmill up as you have plenty of lumber there
I was thinking that you had a grader to do this without using a skid steer on that
Loving his dogs definitely the stars of the show
That's a lot of work done in 37:32! 😂
Seems to be a serious brain wallet inequality. It would be better to flat out the whole mountain, and make a big parking lot instead.
At 71k he got a steal of a deal on that machine, im looking for something like it and similar machines are going for 100k +
Here in Kentuck we would only pay 5
Are the trees dead? Or deciduous? Where is this located?
I'm surprised you don't have your own semi to transport your big stuff.
You are amazing...and inspirational! God bless.
he's a dork
14:30 that machine is fully justified. Before, you'd spend time and fuel jackhammering that crap
I work with heavy machinery here in Brazil too and my dream is to have an opportunity to work in the United States
How interesting!  Thank you..
he's not a heavy equipment operator he just thinks he is
what? huynhdai from vietnamese
WOW~~^^ HYUNDAI from Korea
Nice job!
Andy is better than NY DOT LOL
You should buy your own heavy haul truck and lowboy, with the amount of equipment that you have
I don't know if you will read this, but can you buy and add a tilt rotator on the Hyundai excavator it's very useful for someone who use it a lot of time😊
You are an inspiration!🎉🎉🎉🎉
This definitely wasn't Andrews first day on the controls of a trac hoe. Moving the trees up to the main pile was poetry in motion.
Hay operator yundai salam dari operator Komatsu
At what point did we lose the front blade. Seen to be handy now and then to push dirt. This ‘X’ has seriously long tracks. Is why?
Good job looking good. Well done Andrew xx
I am amazed at how much rock is everywhere underground at your place. And it's in in "plate" form for lack of better words on my part. I wish I had that much "free" stone on my lot here in TX.
Great 👍job on the drive way!!!!
I'd dig a DEEP HOLE and burn those possess trees!!!
I bought a link belt shear from and auction has that same circle a montano sticker on it must b there old machine
Andrew, you could invent a side thumb for the excavator to drag trees more easily
Flying the drone up there wasn't necessary. Just set it on the ground at the bottom, turn it on, pick it up and carry it to the top, set it on the ground, and read the horizontal and vertical numbers.
you know what they say, third driveway's the charm . you know what they say, third driveway's the charm .
And this is how the trees disappear and the woods are getting extinct because of idiots that can decide where they want a driveway🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
😢🎉😂8#-¥;…100000000000000฿
Cool video, new subscriber here. We love our Hyundai equipment, they last forever!!
19:14 Best music at this here point in the video.
you make it look easy[but it is not] it`s skill and years of doing it properly
It’s amazing how he always has the money to buy machinery. $71,000 is a  lot. Is a lot
All that tech and the ole ballpoint pen to the hand to do the heavy work
Zero swing is great in tight quarters but with no blade to stabilize and no ass back there for weight probably wouldn't be my first choice to cut in the driveway and hillside with
Great Job, question why are you still after all these years still using your hands for traveling instead of your feet ? I use to watch your channel quite often but I got burned out on You-Tube, nice purchase. Please don’t take my questions as criticism, I’ve been an heavy equipment operator / supervisor for thirty five years in land development industry mainly digging mainline to install wet utilities sewer, storm and water, but have done start to finish land development, beginning with clearing land to grading for sidewalks and asphalt. Retired at fifty five and just turned fifty seven in June. Anyway again great video. Thumbs up from me. *7-15-2023
Just drop $71K on a new toy.
24:25 тебе зачем эта дорога ,или это всё снято для видео?
The music makes me think of that soldier that uses chapstick 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
i like your excavator
This New Road needs a little Dressing Up!
Dynamic Work!
Nice job, you made it look easy, when in fact a difficult job!
Except for the trees, wouldn’t a large bulldozer be much quicker?
😅aaaamllwal]aaaamllwal] my Mlm l😂😂😂
Hi Andrew, The new drive looks awesome! Great Job!😁
coulda done the drone thing instead with a 1000ft piece of clear tubing and some water
y he sound like ben shap1ro on 2x speed LLLOL
thank you Andrew , i hope to watch more and more as well as re-wach as im happy to do! Congratulations with the new Hyundai excavator! It will of course pay for itself! I hope to see a dedicated museum area of Camerata vehicles with a short history on a plaque vidoe! Let them rust away in the knowledge they took you to where you are today and afforded you great memories! Love your work!
Thanks Andrew very good video.
Haven’t watched Andrew for a while and am glad that you finally purched a new excavator to do your work ! Glad to see that less break downs and more production ! Congratulations to see you move up in your business ventures to do more and better work !
Why don’t you bury wood where you want to garden. Read up on hugelculture.
How much time did you put in this? My estimate is 4 days?
Komatsu is my brand of choice.
This dude is a “ Terra-Former”
where you drive over the stone at 11:00 - that reminded me so much of the terminator 1 cut scenes, it's skulls, however
Do you not have a dozer in your machines.
how many working hours did you put into this?
4 day job?
+
Hollywood is trying to get him to direct the new kill dozer movie only this time it's kill dozer's a D11 and a komatsu 575 both on a rampage and the island is only twenty acre's for those poor construction workers to hide in
Yep the third time is a charm my old granddaddy use to say if you can't fix it get a bigger hammer or a bigger machine
As usual anderw brilliant job buddy looking forward to seeing the next video. Stay safe mate.
Nice new (to you) digger,  You made short work out of that new driveway.  Your skills are impressive.  Thanks for the great video Andrew. 👍
The plane of the driveway needs to slope in towards the hill, with a gulley on the inside (the right side if you are going up the driveway) to carry rainwater down and not across the driveway.
Amazing Excavator Hyundai 👍👍
The sheer power of hydraulics always amaze me!
I was looking at the route that you were diging as you were coming down the hill and I thought that the rocks are going to cause issues and needed to come out.  If you do a part 2 to this it would work out with having to fix those for the safety of the land owner when cold weather and ice hit that area.
anyone knows the song at 25:00??
That’s a strong aZZ excavator DAMN
I'm curious about the choice of an excavator vs. a Bulldozer to make the initial cut.
The old driveway was about a 13 degree slope and the new driveway is about a 6 degree slope. Correct me if my math is wrong.
love !
I think your new excavator was a wise choice and should give you lots of good service, Dirt Perfect loves his Hyundai and has had no trouble with it, I hope you have the same Andrew.
What can I say another good job there’s nothing else I can say you doing excellent work and I enjoy watching you God bless
👍👍👍
At 14:30...hoooly bleep! That ain't no Elantra..
Nice job, love your new toy.
How come the excavator has stickers from the truck company all over it? Saw this on other equipment in a different vid too.
Nice machine.
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Nice job.
I think it’s time Andrew gets some paving equipment..
in the all the years ive been watching you, ive always wondered why you dont fit tiger teeth to your diggers? you know your digging rock why not make it easy?, in australia its the first thing we do to avoid using a hammer
How hard is the drone to figure out? been thinking about getting one.
That is shale, not stone, correct?
It is fascinating to a layperson that you can lift that stone and not tip over!
good job )))
Привет, тёзка! Очень познавательные видеоролики.. Скажи, а для строительства дороги на своем участке нужно ли получать разрешение властей на строительство, должны ли власти согласовывать проект? Или если это частная собственность, то строй хоть метро?
You spend  71 what ? for it ?!😮
two thumbs up
nice to see CC is enabled.
Is it a 2014 Hyundai 235 LCR-7 or LCR-9?
Pythagorean Theorem Andrew!
He has a new D 7 cat now....
China
Anyone that writes measurements on their hands is absolutely the guy you want working for you. Have always loved the vids Andrew.
Last scene absolutely beautiful! What state is that?!
awesome!
Great video!!!
What kind of rock is that?  Is that considered shale?  Is it a favorable or nonfavorable rock to work with?   I like watching your vids.  They show what work needs to be done to make projects happen.
Just more junk to add what you have in your yard ,only thing you make your $$ from you tube channel
Ееееебать, как много плитняка!!! • To fffffakk, so much flagstones!
Wow congrats Andrew. I love the new machine. Been thinking of hyundai lately as they a gaining a lot of traction in the industry. Looks like a solid rig!!
Dam man l thought you were good and till this video 👎
🎉🎉😂 you 😢4 by
Hey Andrew! I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to make these videos. They have become incredibly useful for helping me relax and fall asleep. The way you operate the excavator is almost therapeutic, and it's been a game-changer for my bedtime routine. Keep up the fantastic work, and I look forward to more soothing excavator adventures!
Simillar rock is used to make roofing shingles in france. Its a old method but uses material readily available. The shingles are shaped with a hammer and nailed to the wooden frame of the roof.
Mr Andrew,i like your work with excavator...good job
is it not better to take the drone by hand to the place? the measurment would be the same
Such a thin layer of soil on-top huge rocks, it's amazing the tree roots can find a way through the rocks.
Could have just used the GPS on the phone to work out the height and distance, but I guess when you have a drone, for every problem there's a drone solution.
Andrew is a true American hero, a self-made man putting his mark on the world (literally).  I tune in his videos when I need a break from the constant insanity of the world these days.  Plus I learn cool things!
Great work mate. Cheers Nick , from sunny down under
After hard a day of digging I go to home and watch a digging.Just relax.Thank you for video!
Nice work. I’ve wondered how those excavators worked
You have been playing with your machines ever since you were a little boy....
Hey Andrew can’t you increase the thumb speed in the settings so it goes faster that thing is hella slow
Bad ass.
Love, love, your channel
Too bad this kind of excavator is not running a blade. It would be so usefull.
Now we're gonna need a trailer for the new machine
You should relocate those trees no need to destroy them like that you clown
Too bad those large rocks would have been a cool feature to look at driving up.
I am back l had to get me newbphone l love watch you
Andrew has new equipment that doesn't immediately need maintenance?!?
Geometry not one of my better subjects in school ,There's a lot more Blue stone for your Crusher . Time to fire up the old D6 . I liked the way you lined up the large stone blocks along the outside edge of the drive way
As an arborist that one rotten tree he pushed over was an eye opener. Hardly took anything to pop that thing over
слушай а что ты только по верху капаешь , вырыл бы уже бункер себе в скале )
Tienes trabajo para mí?? También sé mover el equipo operador.😊
Great video Andrew love the new machine it's a beast.
I miss those videos when you replace colvert pipes etc :D
Андрюха наконец то видосик
That would have been a nice driveway marker
Camarata do you have an oil filter cart to get water out of your hydraulic oil?  If so, do you have any videos on the cart? Thanks
This machine would benefit from a Rototilt system 👍🏻
thanks have fun
You should get a rotortilt for it
How long did it take you?
Nice job
What are the hrs on the machine looks in good condition
Mighty nice operating there. The only thing that would have been better would have had a loader with chains to hook to those downed trees and pull them to the clearing.
That excavator, is a wise choice. Thank you for sharing.
Looks pretty bumpy
What about smoothing it out so that it is the angle all the way?
That rock is so cool.  You could build a nice castle with it.
Flat earth
You couldn’t ask for a better road bed than all that rock. I didn’t think your excavator had enough lead in its pencil to pick up those huge boulders but it did. That was impressive. I wouldn’t want to be driving on that new driveway and have one of those huge boulders roll onto my car. They look pretty secure.
So cool to have the equipment to just make another road.
Drone watching a drone. So cool
I enjoy watching you with all the different projects that you do it has inspired me to get more equipment I already had a loader but now I have a new excavator on its way also
Did he say anything about getting rid of any of his older slightly used equipment?
that quite a small excavator for this kind of job
Are you suppose to cut from the top down or doesn’t it matter?  Can you start cutting from the bottom of the hill?
A drone to watch a drone, like a bond movie. Always excelling production. Nice.
Can't wait to see you get this machine on the mountain. As usual thought video was great.
After watching that excavator, that mini-skidsteer looks like a tiny "toy." 😅
Now that's an *EXCAVATOR!* 👍
great Job Men .-)
Why doesn't anyone in the US dig ditches when they make roads? do you enjoy driving in eroding mudslides?
Nice work, greetings from from Slovakia
Very interesting The new m/c is terrific Great job 👍👍
How bad is that hillside going to wash out in the rain?
Nice work.👍👍👍
71k?
I love that Andrew would rather sit on footage for a year and a half and release it when he’s done with a project rather than be like a typical YouTube or that has to turn every project into the 16 part video series and talk and talk and talk
Millions of sticks on the ground, and the dogs always want the same one!  I enjoy the content of your videos!  That burn pile would make for a nice 4th of July Fire!
I just love it when you get newer and better equipment, you are reaping what you have been sowing for so long. Cheers!
Insanely cool music!! Who is it?
How do the trees stand up with hardly any roots
New? What?...
Thanks for this video. It was awesome seeing you on a job site.
That last drone shot was so cool!
Need to finish it off with your dozer
Didn`t know that New York had wilderness like this. Nice countryside. Out west is still my preference. Good video. The excavator paid itself off on this job?
I thought "Oh no" no blade. But that thing has so much power just sweeps debris away.
Gratulerer med ny maskin 👍
Nice job Andrew!!!
you can put a gps tracker on the dogs, Yee, those short tail radius machines really cum in handy
Can I have a job please?
You paid $7,100 or $71,000?
need to toss a camera on the dogs to see where they run off to!!!
👍👍
Just wondered why you didn't dig up the hill rather than down? Seems like your leverage would have better unless you were worried about the larger rocks coming into your machine.
I’m from Chile, we can also do whatever we want. I see a lot of comments about getting permits and stuff. I’m glad I live in a place where we’re truly free to do anything we want.
With all the trees I’ve seen you take down and or burn. Your next piece of equipment needs to be a saw mill.
new camera work/editing is ok, but there seems to be way too much movemnt in a few chunks of the video. section from 12:00 ish onwards especially
Come on. You know they went looking for a swimming hole ! 👍😎😃
Geeze, the rock there is just amazing. Garbage wood but incredible rock for building roads.  Also, 12% +/- avg vs 28%+/-avg is a pretty good change. Couldn't see it very well in the video but the numbers don't lie.
so innovative! this is why i started following you years ago.
Andrew is a successful YouTuber that would have been successful without YouTube, there's not too many other YouTubers I can say that about.
I love watching Andrew play with his new toys and this one is special hey tree you're in my way, 5 ton boulders no problem, that first boulder probably weighed more than that
71,000 or 7100?
Great action.
Nice job Andrew.
Did he pay $7,100 or $71,000
AC for president!!!
Ooooh, cool Boulder 😎 😅 remember that movie where a thing like this falls into a hole in the ocean because of a storm!? Yeah loved that movie 😊 this was cool to watch 😮💜
Hello
Excellent Job Brother 👏 👍 Another Excellent Video ❤
Any updates to the container house???
Extremely beneficial to see the measuring scale. Observing the vision come to fruition. Nice having the natural bedding materials scratched out in process.
Super Video, Glückwunsch zum neuen Bagger, tolles Teil. Weiter so, freue👍 mich schon auf das nächste Video von Dir.
Digging that new machine! Best of luck with it!
Should have bought a CATERPILLAR 235 instead
A well founded driveway with a bonus load of firewood,what a deal !!  🙃🙃
Korean
you paid $71.00 dollars for that?   Oh by the way that drive needs to be at least a 100 wide. or else it will erode away.
since when is 387 double 212?
Excellent video, can't wait for part II.
Great video as always, thanks for sharing.
Damn man you beat me buying that machine buy 2 days! Oh well still looking.😊
I'm pushing Sleeperdude channel.  Check it out. Good stuff
The operator of that excavator needs training. Sloppy controls.
Love those big rectangular rock your getting out of that cliff
How come you haven’t used your swale bucket on a work site? 🤔
cool drive 3rd amazing, great slate their in ground , wouldnt be any good for farming on keep great work Andrew
Gotta keep those Koreans employed. It's all the appliances big box sell anymore. Their finishing the job the Japanese started in the 70's...
I bet this guy could fix our economy .
As always Fabulous video, liking the new Mach E glad that you’re happy with it so far !! Stay safe keep the updates coming buddy 👍👍… Stay safe!!👍👍🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Who else is praying Blu gets bigger than Cody!  Grasshopper take the stick from my mouth...
Awesome content very satisfying, Andrew makes it look so easy!
Very valuable stones
Should of stuck with Hitachi Andrew them Hyundai's are pure scrap
Hyundai of South Korea makes excellent equipment largest ship builder in the world . I was at CONEXPO construction exhibit biggest in world Vegas awesome they were there. Boycott xcmg Sany POS  Ccp China junk slave labor made machines..
So much rock in that place. To can carry your rock crusher and pave the drive way after.
7.1к or 71k did he mean for new excavator?
how dow pay for all ur stuff u have too much to be on the level
His new machine is a beast
Чего-то не понял . У тебя сланец?! Смотрю , то у тебя нормальная почва, а потом камень 🪨!!!! Вопрос 🙋‍♂️
Молодец.
Im suprised you didnt go bigger lol they must really love you up at montano by now.
Andrew's excavating videos are about the only ones I will watch on YT because he throws the video into high speed with good music for background and only slows it down for the important parts. Most of the other Youtubers don't do that and instead they drone on and on in their long videos telling this story and that story and what should be a short video turns into a long one. Good job, Andrew, on both the new driveway and the way you do your videos.
Nice work, how long did that stage take?
Great Movie! Very Best Wishes With Your New (to you) Excavator Andrew!
Please bow your head and say this prayer 🙏  "CREATOR, LORD GOD, Please help me against evil and all who favor it. Thank you for everything CREATOR, LORD GOD. Amen."  Please do this now 🙂🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please bow your head and say this prayer 🙏  "CREATOR, LORD GOD, Please help me against evil and all who favor it. Thank you for everything CREATOR, LORD GOD. Amen."  Please do this now 🙂🙏🙏🙏
That's one heck of a machine
Andrew has to be one of the greatest content creator! This is better than Discovery channel, and Andrew is a one man army! Great job Man!
😂 was just thinking the same
He works hard and he sure plays harder great new tool
Makes you realise how nice some places still are on planet earth 👍🏼
I absolutely love watching these videos
“New” excavator and it also appears to be a “new” Takeuchi CTL. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻  Edit:  Homeowners TL8. 🤷🏻‍♂️
you leave a lot of organic material in your roads and driveways lots of soft and rough spots in the future.
Bigger machine, bigger rocks. (And thanks for the captions.)
You need a 8ft I beam for leveling with the excavator
Music was on point for this video!
Thanks for filming
I've got a big old bucket and I scoop all the time Digging holes in the ground, wonder what I'll find I'm an earth investigator I'm an excavator 🎵
Anyone want to take bets on how long it take Andrew to brake this excavator?
7,100 or 71,000?
Andrew, did you have a survey done or get any engineering work done before you did this?
love it
Please have more regular video uploads please.
well planned and executed. nice work
New York will soon be the next prairie state when Andrew is done with it 😂
Drone on Drone action,  cool.😅
that's the biggest small excavator i have ever seen its a beast
Finally a real machine!
Those 235's LCR are brilliant..we have 2 on a macadamia plantation in northern mozambique.  Brilliant for working in tight inter row spaces. They quickly became favourites between the operators. 25% more fuel efficient than the cats too...Hitachi excavators still run circles around everything else though. Great video Andrew.
Watch out with that Hyundai they are known for blowing hydraulic pumps
Dang, that was nice low-boy. Thanks for letting him catch a couple of gears as he drove away. Sounded great, killer shifts.
Nice work Andrew, I love how your work and video's continue to evolve! My only critique would be to work on the uphill side to bring it back to close to the angle of repose where possible.
Great job!
yeah ..destroying trees .. cool
Andrew OK
4000 hours in 9 years? Where did you find that jem? Or how much did it break the bank?
Andrew you need to Demo the CASE Minotaur DL550 Compact Dozer Loader
Wow nice 235 Hyundai   nice job on the driveway glad to see you back
This person is my neighbor
"Two Dogs One Stick"   😄😁😆😅🤣😂
I know Andrew has many,many hrs operating,  my friend you make it look so easy... I appreciate the drone use as a measuring  tool...always be open to new ideas...
Great job AC, enjoyed watching you carve out the hillside.  Your new (to you) Hyundai 235 is a beast too.👏🏻
you know what they say, third driveway's the charm 😎
not gonna lie i miss the days of doing project jobs and stuff.. this building roads all over the same mountain is getting old
2014? Wow, that poor machine has no idea. Andrew, it might be time for a firewood processing plant soon with all the tress you're always dealing with.
The new Excavator is really nice Andrew.  The zero tail swing is so convenient.
I've operated a few 235 Zero swings over the years and they are an awesome machine, very handy for tight spots, Nice buy Andrew. Awesome job
Nice excavator,  were you specifically looking for a low/no tail swing model?
Nice job
Isn’t it nice to not be force-fed an athletic greens, squarespace, simplify safe or surf shark ad? Videos without an agenda are the best. Thanks for not being sold into that stuff Andrew.
Do you like old vehicles and equipment?
Thanks for sharing an off site project! I enjoy watching progress on your mountain but I also enjoy seeing the other homeowner maintenance and repairs.
"I can push the Rocky Mountains into the sea. Heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me."
Hi Andrew, I see a lot of dead trees, how comes? Is it a natural proces or climat change?
Muy buen trabajo andrew 💪💪💪💪💪
Looks like a great thing for climate change
ドローンってそんな使い方があったんだーあいわらずワイルドでカッコイイねー👍
Nice track hoe nice work on the driveway 😎👍👍
So no ditches on the up hill side for water run off? No culverts?  Are you going to finish this? Maybe I missed that part.     I would have sloped the cut side too.     Zero swings are nice. Sweet machine.
Welcome to 2Tr ❤❤❤Sub! 🌹❤✋👍
It’s great to see Hall and Oates are still making an impact. Andrew has really struck gold this time.
It looks like it will be a pleasure to use. Everything looks nice and tight on it too.
Another great video. Can’t get enough. Ends way too soon. We want more.
Hi Andrew I live in New Zealand and i just i love your show. Cool bro keep it up
Great video production work. I wish our products could do the same.😃😃
❤❤❤
I’d say the new to him excavator is pretty much perfect 👍
How do you find the new machine Andrew?? Pity it hasent got the blade but hey least it works, not bad for 23.5 tonne
Someone said you are colouring potatoes instead of eggs this Easter.
cool muzic at 19 minutes
Oh, and you got an other beeper. LOL
Nice job as always Andrew. I can tell you're going to have loads of fun with your new toy, hopefully lots of jobs as well. The only problem with that machine, you can't move it yourself, I guess hiring someone with lowboy to transport. Nice video. 👍👍👍👍👍😉🇺🇸
That little machine is a BEAST. I Love it. I also very much a enjoy all you put out. It's just good, clean, honest to a fault. Fun. Thank you Andrew.
we just picked up a 2016 Takeuchi TB230, looks like it was well taken care of, first time owning one of that brand, seems like a decent rig so far
Nice work! I like that little ledge you could park a small car on.
Alot of firewood to last  10 winters ..
When it's Spring time in the Catskills   I'll be droning on the hill Getting footage for my channel To give you all a thrill  When it's spring time in the Catskills  Andrew's gonna move some rocks  With a brand new excavator  And a few holes in his socks.
Surveying with a drone. Nice.
👍👍
Love the new excavator sir! 🙂
Confuse drivers ..
😛😛😛😛❤❤❤🦾🦾🦴👍👍👍👍👍👍
Amazing stone for rock masons. My grandfather used to build walls and fire places in home with stuff like that.
Wish I had an extra 71k lying around to buy an excavator.
Smooth operatin buddy
Where is this located?
I'm blown away at the skills some people have.  I once knew a forrester who could cruise a couple acres of timber and tell the owners within less than 5% error how many board feet of hardwood and softwood he had on 600 acres of property.  Andrew walks a hillside and not only knows he can make money off a job but he knows how well the job will go before the first shovel of soil is moved.  He's amazing.
You got to put a scratch , or something. That’s way too new!!!!
You should use all your big flat rock to bank up the high side of your road
I am simply amazed at how those large slabs of "rock" fracture into these little layers when you apply pressure.  Simply amazed.
Andrew's "new" excavator is like owning a car made in the same decade you're currently living in! 😂😂😂
32:10 a cute story of 2 robots helping each other clean up a bit
Looking mighty nice..  !!!
Excelent vid Andrew- Only thing is, we need more of them!
Slowest thumb on that machine I ever seen ....at least it seems that way
Does anyone know why all those trees are friggin hollow?
I think you could use a motor grader at sone point.  I have seen many road constructions the a grader would finish nicely.
Great video 🎉
and wanted also to comment on your editing skills man they are right on body the layout of your platform the video everything is right on target good job buddy thumbs up on your platform
The GPS receiver in your phone should be able to tell you the height difference fairly accurate as well. Just to verify the results that the drones gave
What kind of trees are those? Hard woods?
Nice work 💪👍😉⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌳☀️👌
3 rd time...    there is always enough $ to do it over 2x do the math       D'oh x D'oh =Doohh! or as we say in Hawaii "you could of had beachfront"
Cant say I’ll ever get the land like that, but that’s pretty dam close to my dream driveway one day, zig zag up the mountain side
❤❤❤❤❤
I've been watching you for so many years it's absolutely amazing you can afford to spend that much cash on equipment now congratulations man you made it
Nice video, thanks!!
Must really feel good to not buy American.
Every woman in the world should watch this video
Andrew, having watched all your videos over the last few months since i discovered your channel. it is amazing to see how much you have leveled up your operators skills in the last couple of years. You really make this look easy
clicked the thumbs down on accident but i corrected it
That a fun way of using the drones. I usually just use my cell phone, a stick, and a good GPS app.
Thank you.
How long did this take you
You should get a semi with a trailer to haul it around!
That blue stone ledge you have there in NY makes things look so much easier than any of work I see done here in New England with our Granite… great job, look forward to the dress up video
in the next episode, our daunting hero buys and 18 wheeler and trailer, you know, so he can move his new toy from job site to job site.
😎💯✌I Can Do That,...
Does the Hyundai excavator not have a rear weight? It looks very short so if it doesn't have a rear weight would that make it less likely to be incapable of lifting heavy materials?
I was hoping for some dozer action.
Awesome !,love it !!!!!,🔴🫢🤫
Missing your dozer blade yet...
there's a thousand STICKS on the ground ... and the two dogs both want the SAME one!
I can tell this is not Your first rodeo!..nice Andy.
“That’s driveable . . . technically.”  Don’t ever change.
As always great video Andrew 👍 been watching you for years , never miss a new video !
I got a similar job for you Andrew on a 100 acre lot in central NH ! If you find yourself in need of a new project, let me know! 😉
Muito legal excavator Hyundai!😁👌
Bro videos got over 300k views in a day!
Lot of Youtube creators these days with second channels like More Andrew Camrata
For some reason when the quad pulled up with the two dudes I flashed on Mad Max scene when the guy in shoulder pads on the street bike pulls up and stops. He had a passenger also.
Andrew gonna start a new sub channel,, Mountain Road Engineering
Another job well done those rocks were un real  jealous of ur drone footage lucky if I get mine to fly in a straight line 😂
Time and driving will help to smooth the driveway.
Be sure to knock out those widow makers you have in below the edge of that drive. I see several. That’s an issues when knocking trees into other trees…unavoidable but you should make sure and clear them….fwiw
Cody and Blue. Branch management.
Hello Mr. Camarata, when are you gonna build a steel structure to store all your machines?
Nice work.
Yep keeping up with the diesel creek, channel.
Lot of rotten trees!!!
$71 K, that is is one expensive toy but very capable for the  job!    Good Choice Andrew!
andrew should by a takeuchi excavator
Imagine if Andrew had a machine with Rototilt or Steelwrist. I guess you Americans like old technology 😅. Excellent video as always 🤙🏻
U are a outstanding operator but u need to get a rototilt for your machine... it will cut your time in half and open a whole new world for you with your machine... 3 good brands "rototilt" "engcon" or "steelwrist" CHECK THEM OUT on YT!!!
which DJI drone model & controller you using [MAVIC 3 & Smart Controller]? I build my own drones but I need a recognized model (by non fliers) to backup (correlate) project data...this type of demo you put on here is an excellent tool!!
Or is this your house that your building the driveway for
Cody still showing Blue he is the boss.
I like this kind of videos, this Jobs outside of the "mountain property".
how come you didnt use your cat on this one?
They should invite you to the Construction Expos.
👋🏻
Nice machine that is pal
nice job. Andrew.  Keep them coming.
You made that look easy. . . .
34:45 Typical, there are over 3 million sticks in this woods, but no, Blue and Cody have to fight over a single stick, lol
Andrew - How many hours did you have on that project? I have a similar project on my property in Western NC, but will be using a smaller excavator.
Soon; Andrew sits in his “Castle” while he links his drones to ALL his equipment and we watch the mechanized Camarata fleet disperse from the yard for it’s assigned tasks for that day. Outstanding use of the drone mapping !  Thanks for the video sir. Be Safe out there
Imagine how smooth it would be if Andrew knew about float mode on that Takeuchi
Andrew 🔝🔝🔝💪💪💪👋👋👋
That rock blocking makes for a natural safety as it acts like a guard rail, and place to sit. Great idea.
Andrew displaying the pythagorean theorem
If you want to show the work of a drone, you have to film the drone with a drone.
We just have solid granite here not as easy to dig
Very nice. Good luck with the new shovel.
New driveway is like 12% slope on average and old one was 24%, damn, barely shows on camera
I like the new excavator , great video , awesome content .
If anybody was wondering: It's a gradient change from 14.4° to 6.8° so less than half the incline.
Best content on You tube bar none! Great job Andrew!
Good job with the excavator. I think bringing in the dozer to finish would work well. Cheers..
i would want some big ole rocks on the sides of that driveway just sayin'
Badass machine. What made you go with a zero turn over having a counterweight?
At 7:46 you can Andrews use of “modern technology”. A palm pilot….
I couldn’t watch the first part where the cameraman was moving on every shot, please don’t do that again.
Andrew how long did this project take ?
Hey I can't help but wonder what Chris with Letsdig18 thinks of the Hyundai Excavator with the counter weight  zero tail swing option, cuz Chris doesn't like his excavators counter weights to be touched or scratched.
Simply, Excellent work!!
nice video andrew nice excavator
Is that a crack in the bucket at 14:23 ...
Nice new unintended stone bench at the top of the hill.
Era meglio un hitachi..
Nice work Andrew, now everybody who delivers stuff to this guy's house is gonna have a much easier time getting up that driveway and they have you to thank!
Always amazing!
Takie for the win!
Good Luck With The New Excavator Andrew !...
Hello Andrew a greeting from the south of France. How long for this construction site congratulations for your Youtube channel
Andrew + excavator + skid steer = instant driveway , WELL DONE
Do you sell your old equipment?
Cool to see how u measured the hills with a drone while filming with another.
Camarata 100 excavators goal. 80 more to go! YAY!
You are gonna get so much clearing work now that you have that!!
that machine made it look so easy
Well, you should be able to get a lot more stuff done and bigger jobs with that thing that’s for damn sure 😮😮😮😮
how many excavators are there now. 10? or more? It's slowly becoming confusing.  You have more excavators than our not small state-owned company has. 🤭
You make it look easy!! GREAT JOB!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Much nicer driveway.
o ideal não seria um topografo fazer o levantamento e traçar a no rota?
i was looking around on line  seems you got that 235 for a great price with 4000 hrs ..   i saw twice as many hours on some   that were 20 grand more ... nice score!!
Been a while since I’ve seen one of your videos.  Love the new excavator.  It looked big on the trailer.  How does it compare on the size chart for ones used for residential & commercial work?
I have no earth moving experience.  Is there a difference/benefit to using the excavator over a dozer to put in a road?
Wasting a lot of time when ya could of put a cable around all three and pulled them up! - carry on!
👍👍👍💙💛❤ANDREW , bine gandit, bine lucrat.Excelenta lucrare si practica.💙💛❤👍👍
Random White Pine. Carful.
Love your videos
4:43 a drone filming a drone... droneception...
Wow, while I was watching the video 4047 other viewers had also done the same.
Your new machine-made quick work of the rough in...  A lot faster than the Koehring would have done...  And your moving expense, of the Koehring, would have dug into your profit...Twice... I can't see the Koehring leaving the mountain for years, if it does move... How much weight does the "short swing" add to the weight of the machine ???
Nice work
I'm guessing this job might pay for one-third of the excavator?
Finally a job on someone else's property. There used to be only movies like this. Best regards Andrew :D
Andrew you should have an excavator with a rotating bucket. Dragging those logs would have been so much easier.
👍
When you're making lots of money, write-offs are a smart move. Why run junk?  It's called an asset expense, and depending on price, you can write off  the entire thing.
Very well done
Awesome video Andrew.
Its hard to explain just why it is so satisfying to watch this kind of work being done, since Adam makes it look so easy, maybe we men, or women,  feel that we  might accomplish the same thing with the right equipment.  After watching Adam fight with tree stumps all those years with smaller excavators, its awesome to see mighty Hercules Hyundai come thru and knock them over like so many toothpicks.
Do you have to hire a move everytime for this machine?
Another great video Andy
that poor dodge lol
It’s crazy how Andrew can get more things done in one day then a whole construction team on the highway
great job as always. is that a chocolate lab  or a silver lab? I getting a silver lab puppy in a few days.
+
Good that you actually shecked, that the new drive way would be worth the effort/ costs associated  with  it before starting.  That's very brave and honest  of you. The risk with this for you  is that you actually could have discovered it wasn't  worth  it. with the owner standing at your side while measuring he may have then  cancelled it. I mean you could also  Just have built I because" the owner sead so " and if it had the  same steapnes or steeper  ,just pointed to the fact that he ordered it built.
New full size ex is amazing!  Roughly how many hours did this take you?  I can also appreciate how it must be precarious working on the side of a hill like that and swinging around large trees.
Hope you still kept one of your original Yanmars
This entire area is excellent Deer &  Black Bear Hunting area.  From here all the way up to,   The Canadian Border.  BTW Andy,   Excellent job.  Absolutely outstanding!!   And,  you need to make a-lot more videos Andy!!!  Because all of yours are truly outstanding. 😊
That thing has some power!
a big thank you for this video andrew good work
Nice machine, Andrew.
Top job Andrew,, best excavator operator on YouTube .
Great to see the dogs having fun too.
Do you mind telling me what you do for a living? It looks like it would be awesome to operate heavy machinery all day for a living.
Gday Andrew, I see the Hyundai doesn’t have a back fill/grader blade on it. I’ve only ever used small excavators by comparison and they always had a blade. Handy for getting the tracks off the ground to work on them I found. Just wondered the reason it doesn’t have one? Is it that when the excavators are big that you generally grade after with a faster specialist machine? Or maybe a blade would be damaged easily on such a big machine as it would have such long arms to stick out between the tracks? Anyway, nice job mate, Cheers 👍👍🍻
As always nice work
👍👍👍👍
Dude treat yourself to a new old truck. That dodge is just lookin older than my 62 yr old ass.
I really miss these kinds of video's, nice to see you back in the woods sorting out problems.
Nice machine surprised you got a zero turn
It's awesome seeing you doing jobs again...miss it!! Nice Excavator BTW!
Amazing how easy you make driving a 360 i had a go recently and struggled , guess its just proactive
That Takeuchi - is neither the 10 or the 12! - Is this a new one that Andrew's hesitant to tell us about - or did he rent it locally? WELL - I made it to the end of the video - it was the homeowners machine.
Hes not buying anything. Its the people that watch him tear up perfectly good machinery that pay.
tanks for the lab report.
Cool!
😅
😂
Hugelkulture rather than let those trees rot use them to build the raised veg beds
It might have been mentioned, but you should seriously consider getting an RTK rover setup rather than using a drone's GPS.  RTK is typically better than  1/2" accurate in all dimensions. You should look at what Emlid offer.
Why are you almost always digging with the undercarriage in the wrong direction? Idler wheel is supposed to be in the front.
It’s a pity you don’t have a system to sieve out the rocks and soil, use the rocks keep the soil as it looks amazing and build veg beds
Im surprised , nobody script about the Fox .
Andrew I enjoy your commentary and everything you do and your dogs, aerial photography. But, have you ever plant new trees for future generations, like ones that are better for building with?  I know a lot of what you knock down aren’t great timber but we could do better replacing them.
I do operate same machine,it`s nice to drive!,great vid as always Andrew!
Wow , i d'ont now befor , you can also do Handreading .
Andrew I just wanted to say thank you for all the vids.
Nice to see you back on customer jobs - with your new to you 23 tonne zero turn.  Thanks Andrew
What an awesome video. The Hyundai is sweet.
It work out nicely, but I thought that sort of track/road/driveways were usually cut in with a dozer.
Great job roughing in the new driveway. Nice excavator, a super addition to your fleet, I wouldn't mind having one of that size someday.
Great purchase Andrew.  I bought a 5 ton Hyundai 19 years ago did nearly  7000 his with next to no issues,  retired it 2 years ago , replaced it with a komatsu 5 ton , wished I stuck wit Hyundai  ,awesome machine
Could that model of excavator have had a blade fitted to it Andrew and if so would you have wanted one
What ever else Andrew does, you can always say his filming and editing are excellent.
Wait did he say he paid $71,000 for the machine? That is fucking INSANE, you would not pay over £20,000 for any 14 tonne Hyundai in the UK or Ireland.
Have you ever purchased a New new piece of gear?
Advert after advert in this video, worst i have ever seen. Finally gave up on this one.
A driveway that takes you to nowhere...
You would've paid a lot more for a Cat that does the same job. Let that impressive Hyundai excavator get to work and get the job done.
How long does a project like this take? A day? Week?
Just wondering why you use an excavator for this job instead of a dozer?
Looking nice a normal but Andrew so much advertising 😢😢😢
I think it's awesome that you incorporated those large slabs of rock into barriers on the downhill side.
👍👍👍
I wonder if your skidder would have fit?
Nasty shaky camera
How does this machine compare in size to your other big excavator?
At the end of the video, what is the mountain range in the distance?  I live clear across the country and not very familiar with New York and surrounding areas.
Nice piloting. Creative solution. Cool footage
Was worried for a minute that big rock outcropping waacgonna get destroyed, glad went around it instead
Hi Andrew, how do you quote a job like this? By the day, or each job is different?
Taas anry rakentaa,,ja hyvä tulee!❤❤😂
Another great video!  Andrew, I have to compliment you on the volume control of the music.  So many channels practically blast you out of your chair when they add music, & you constantly have to adjust the volume between the music and dialogue. Your videos are so enjoyable and interesting to watch.
So satisfying.
been watching you for years right when you started the castle build.  You have come a long ways and it shows on your work.  I love the new track hoe she is a beut.
I started off wonder why a bulldozer wasn't used, but that excavator is so versatile.  BTW, what type of all that stone in your area?  Slate, Shale, Bluestone?
There is something seriously wrong with the other big excavator. I initially thought hydraulics but it could be a very tired motor. In any case this new machine was needed. Good call Andrew.
Great job, looks fantastic.
👌👌🤓🤓
Your buddy is a pretty good operator too.
ありがとうございます！
Where's your little friend? Dog bed again?
You need a grader
Nice work Sir! As always  👍👍
High tech mapping! This is the way to go. Work smarter not harder.
Nice to have a larger hoe when it comes to that Blu stone
I see a new attachment to process tress in Andrew's future.
I guess 71 means 71,000!
😢 There is no water for cody to play in! Give him an extra cookie when your back home and tell him hiii from the lowlands 😉 congrats with the new equipment  and goodluck with your video's .
kiss of France good job Andrew 💪
Lotta slop in that 70k hoe
Nice machine good job!
Great job...  new soundtrack too... It's almost like a TV show now. !!
Прикольно, лайкос
Whose skidsteer was that?
Bonjour Je vous remercie d'avoir ajouté à vos vidéos les sous titres , maintenant je traduit en Français vos commentaires Bravo pour vos videos continuez Amitié de France
good job on 1 mil
Nice excavator Andrew, Great job !   Another awesome video !
3840x2160@30, was 60 Hz, greetings from Russia.✌✌
😉👍❤
What a fun project Andrew. I hope your able to take on some bigger projects now that you have every machine in the arsenal lol
Great job Andrew👍👍👍👍👍congrats on the new excavator.
9:17 ooooh, look at all that slate. There’s your master bathroom floor, my friend. [looking again at 15:07] wow! Find and dig up a few more like that and you could build your own menhir. Archaeologists in a few thousand years: “Look, they were still building these!” Your place in the history books = guaranteed.
Time for some tracking dog collars.
Great new purchase!
Omg Andrew its so shiny and new!!!
Surprised you didnt hook a chain to the big trees you drug up the driveway.
Andrew i think your poor dodge deserves some shocks.  😂  that thing sounded sad coming up that hill
It was hard to tell the difference at first, but that last drone shot really gives you a clear view of how much softer the slope is vs the old drive. Nice work as always, Andrew. Great new machine too!
Real nice job Andrew and New Excavator
Looking Great New Driveway awesome Job Andrew
Part two?  Yes!!!  Thanks!
Love it would love a part 2. Thanks
I wish I had some of your rock, would make life much easier. I have 22 acres and haven't found a rock yet, have to haul everything in.
whats your favorite piece of equipment to run?
I see they are keeping you busy. Thanks.
Andrew, fantastic 5 🌟 job and absolutely enjoyed seeing this new to you machine working and not breaking down. As always God bless yah from Gaffney South Carolina viewer 🙏❤️💯
NICE
Andrews back in the game folks.   Are we not entertained?!!
AWESOME JOB BROTHER, NO MATTER WHAT YOU EARNED EVERYTHING! PROUD OF YOU MY FRIEND,  Thanks for sharing, Kirk from Louisiana and always sending prayers for you, your family and those awesome two boys! Cody and Blue! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Welcome back, Andrew! Hope you have time to upload more soon!
Your # 1 in all the videos !
1 man... 27 excavators. 😂 I love this guy.
where ya been, I really miss your videos !
Can’t get any better road base than that brother, awesome stones Andrew! Love the new excavator my friend, it’s awesome too! 👌🏻👌🏻  Andrew, you couldn’t have picked a more perfect location it looks like brother! Road looks amazing brother, you sure know your stuff my friend! 👌🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
These are my favorite videos that you make where you are doing a job for someone else. Great job!
So glad to see newer machinery! Andrew, you've worked very hard and you and your company deserve it! Be well, be safe!
Nothing broke, i thought i was on the wrong channel there for a minute.  great job.  What a beast of a tool.   watching those two wrestle over the same stick has kinda caught on for them.  Nice driveway. kinda ol school Andrew.  Thanks for sharing
I'm waiting for the second part of this, well done.
Really love this video's i wish andrew you would more video's sooner great job.
👍👍
OMG equipment that you don't have to fix before using
Nice
GPS is so much easier.
I thought it was an addition to AC's driveway, but it's not up in the sky!
Just another day in the life of ole AC. The new excavator is a fine addition to the fleet but we haven’t yet seen how it does with paddy-whacking a riding mower into Mother Earth. So it’s only semi-officially onboard. Nice job from jungle to driveway, as always. 🥸👍✅
Andrew, your videos are like CRACK, i get withdraw when you don't post for more than 4 days. LOL 🤣
I love how it makes me feel when I watch you work on other people's projects, you do it with the same gusto as it was your own.
Andrew handles an excavator like a light sabre
That is awesome machine right there I like it. Now the home owner got two driveways.
SUPER EAGER to see a finishing move on this drive way! \(^_^)/
Zero tail swing will be nice I know your minis are but that looks like it has the power do they offer with blade?
Nice to see the dogs get out and about there having fun while daddy working hard
I think after the bell truck it was an eye opener, hard to go back to the old machines...
Wow, great job! You've used bulldozers for other driveways. Is the Hyundai excavator better?
Looks like I need a bigger excavator. Nicely done!!
Job well done as usual Andrew, nice excavator!
This guy can film. Was it the customer?
One thing I can say tho is that little skid-steer does scoot! (~_^)-b
May be a stupid question but could you have done this with a dozer instead?
it's like artwork
It would have been premium to have topped that road off with the big dozer and the compactor! (~_^)-b  But yeah...  'Premium'...  As in a whole lot more munny too. ~( ,m,)~
That gives the home in an "in" road and an "out" road - nice.
Thats one sketchy driveway with those walls
Whoever helped with the filming on this video needs a full time job with the channel. Great job.
but but they said you will own nothing and be happy!
that's a Beautiful area...👍👍👍👍👍👍
Great video and of course the pups had to fight over the same stick when there were 10,000 sticks to chose from.😂 nice work
HANDLES LIKE BUTTER.
Amazing he can barely walk up there and is going to make driveway!!
As always an excellent vid. Thanks for sharing ✌️♥️
Thank you for sharing the price with us!
71K seems cheap for that big of a machine.  Ive been looking at yanmars 55 and people still want an arm and a leg for them.
FIX THAT CUB CADET LAWN/GARDEN TRACTOR! ITS NOT JUNK LIKE NEW STUFF IS! ITS ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE OLD HEAVY BUILT AND CAN'T FIND THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE!
The most fun I've had was building road with an excavator. Nice job
Eventually most of the properties you work on become home sites and grass becomes part of the landscape. Instead of burning the limbs I suggest that you shred them and put the chips on the ground so they candecompose and put good rich organic matter back into the soil.
how long before all that hill falls or washes over the drive. Can you trailer the 235 without restrictions? It is a nice machine
lol that things funny looking, looks like those dogs with the short spine syndrome.
I was just asking myself, " When is he going to come out with the original content?" Thank you!
when he said he paid 71 for it does that mean 7100 or 71,000? I dont know anything about heavy equipment prices.
That’s a game changer
Another surprise brother, looks great Andrew my friend! Nice machine brother and what a great deal my friend! That’s why you’re the man brother! 👌🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Good bye CrapCat
Andrew, u should really build yourself a wooden cabin on the new land. Nothing to big or to small. Something just the right size for u and your friends.
it looks as thou it is always been there. awesome work boss.
Ignorant question: When you said you paid 71 for it: was that 71 hundred or 71 thousand?  Let the laughing begin.... And when you were cutting down the hill... one word: shale.  Thanks for sharing!
I hate when Andrew buys something and it just works out of the box without a 1-2 hour video fixing it up
Did he say he paid 71,000 for it
liked for algorithm
a2 + b2 = c2
I cant imagine destroying all those trees so I could have a second fucking driveway. What an asshole.
How about you run that 30ton roller a few times up and down the driveway
Yeah, I loved my Hitachi 135US with the ultra-short cab.  You do realize that you are probably going to have to break down and get a lo-boy trailer of your own, and probably a proper truck to haul same, yes?
Thanks for uploading on my Birthday!!! Just made my night after work
There is only on thing I wish he would do in these videos, give us a time reference of gow long each stage of the work took.
Good old Cody..get's out of the truck and immediately goes for a stick...love those pooches.
Nice new to you excavator, it has good power for a tight swing excavator. It ripped the shale with ease.
Great idea measuring with the drone. I'll have to keep that in mind. Measured trees but never grade.
What do you buy a guy who has two of everything? A notepad.
Just amazing how you made the road. How many years of wood was that.
Nice machine man. You in NY too? Looks familiar
I am surprised with all the road construction Andrew has done in the past and more recently he has never got a motor grader like a jd 570 or fg 75 aka a NorAm or now Weller.
Andrew that is a hell of a nice  excavator....Thanks my friend 👍                                                                              Shoe🇺🇸
Any way to turn up the thumb on the Hyundai, they seem to have the slowest thumb?  Can’t stand waiting for thumb to close…those Cats have fast thumbs…like a snapping turtle!
Whens the new tractor and low boy trailer coming? lol
Nice job.   Always enjoy❤❤❤❤
Andrew it's great to see you with a new toy ! I always enjoy watching your videos , and your expertise at running and repairing heavy equipment..
New video, new equipment😃 👍🏽 anyone else love the sound of the rocks?
Thanks Andrew. Great video
and he has a ton of firewood!
Looks like the Dodge finally got a heavy duty bumper!
Taking an excavator down that hill was quite a deal. I think it showed a degree of courage. Enjoyed the video.
Okay Andrew❗️That's what I expect from you, clearing land and leveling a driveway in a day. Love it...
Does this replace the Hitachi?
Moving those slate rocks was wild! I can’t believe it dropped while you where taking that photo op with it. Ugh I want some bad ass equipment too haha
2a Base , 3" binder & 3" superpave ....$240,000.⁰⁰
Great video as always.
Nice machine .... how many excavators are in your fleet now..?
What kinda bobcat did he have? Does he still Have it ? Maybe…..
Would love to see a video doing the maintenance on the new ex. The maintenance videos are my favorite
Hell yeah that’s a nice piece of equipment
Feltro 19 I love AC and all of his videos and he is very good operator but operators who dig around utilities in the street gas electric water and sewer are the real operators moving dirt and rocks does not compare to digging in the street!!
See your upgrading your equipment, think your buying newer used equip to avoid break downs, down time is expensive. Great video. Zero Tail good up grade.
Man U gotta post the video of u building tht bumper on yr truck if u made one
1:16 great gearing up
Andrew I am surprised that you don't have a industrial-grade wood grinder. Dogget has some nice ones. Just look at all the trees that you have burned on the mountain . You could make some of the best trails using the mulch layered trails for your snowmobiles and walking or ATV trails along with your customers who want trails or yard makeover.
Dude must be rolling in $$
I'm sure I'm out of the loop... but what happened to Sam?
Nice Excavator Andew 🎉 Cody growing up. Blue n Cody have such fun . Happy Dogs 👍🏻👍🏻😅
Nice to have money.
That one will need a semi to move it about. Looking in the truck classifieds?
Update. The massive hanging boulder halfway along has fallen onto and blocked driveway. Doh
That’s too big for your deck over trailer though, no?
Would a dozer have been a better choice?
I thought you bought another Takeuchi until the end, almost referred you to skid steer anonymous.  Congrats on the Excavator, love to see how far you've come.
Zero turn, nice!
71k?
Whats up with the in video discriptions about OF girls and stuff?! 😂🤣
How long did this job take from start to finish?
Was this a five day compression?
Dang they got those tracks tight as a banjo string. They don’t move or flop at all.
Excavator. For when a dozer can't cut it!
Not sure on the numbers is it a 23.5 ton? It looks to small to be a 35ton machine, but I am impressed by how big of rocks it could pick up.  Nice purchase Andrew.
15:50 Wonder if that drop off is as steep as it looks on video.   ay caramba
Great video mate, most YouTube channels covering this kind of work would have stretched this out over five different videos. Cheers from down under.
poor pines...
what do you consider to be the benfits of using an excavator for something like this instead of a dozer or track loader?     also if this new machine can take attachments why didnt you use a jackhammer?
I'm only saying that Andrew should get a $130000 for that type of project because I'm putting in 75 to a $150000 bathrooms. That should? Only. Be? About.65000 tops I know everybody needs to make their money I guess? 💰 😅
Good practical use for the drone.
Fire on the mountain run boys run
Nothing but respect. Amazing skills. Great job Andrew.
Andrew number one  !!!! Hallo Alex from Milan Italy 🇮🇹🇺🇸
Are the controls same as your other excavators? You seem right at home.
I put that driveway bid down for 130000
Good entertainment as usual !
Are you sure that's the right eskavator for you that thing's pretty clean and pretty new
Our Bobcat seems like it's always broken. And the repairs are expensive AF. It was a great machine for a lot of years but now it is just one thing after another. We are religious on maintenance and don't abuse any of our machines. I have been eyeing an ASV TR-120 tracked skid steer. Anyone have any thoughts on that? Or another brand? Also looking at a Gehl and a JCB.
New skidsteer andrew?
What ever happened to that girl that was always helping you out…
best part is dogs
Must be a huge change for Andrew to buy a piece of equipment and not have to put any work in to it before using it.
Just another video of Andrew moving a mountain!
Is that Chinese spy drone? Don’t fly too high,as always good job.
Am I blind because I don't see anything level happening lol.. it's still just another driveway going uphill
I'm guessing that 1st long gated rock that he pulled out. Is. About 4 and a 1/2? Tons.
🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍
After this. It's time for the D10.
AC, I would hit that drive way @50   ;)
YOU MUST HAVE TONS OF MONEY  THAT THE IRS FAILED TO COLLECT , WE'LL SEE AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT OUT
71,000 or   7,100 ?
With age comes wisdom, you get tired of working on older stuff and just want to have fun doing whatever
Nice job, Andrew
That's my boy coming in with the Trigonometry.
You know you hired the right guy when you see the end results of Andrews labor.
Boa noite Andrew   muito ótimo  esse trabalho  máquina meu amigo
Another great job Andrew !😊
I think Andrew has an even bigger equipment purchasing addiction than Matt from Diesel Creek.
science !!!
oh joy..
12% grade give or take.
now to cut down about 100 more trees
Beautiful machine. Looks new even though it isn’t.
How does this excavator compare to your hitachi?
I wonder what the first thing that’ll break for no reason will be
Andrew,  great video, real nice driveway 😊
YaY....... Living the Dream....  U Have.!  And the Have-Nots get to Watch... lol
Cute little bucket on the TL
The world is a better place with Andrew Camarata's videos.  And, that Vator is a BEAST!
Andrew your one of the best operators of equipment I have ever seen brother
Get a “Zip level”. Game changer.
Dorks 34:44
If he keeps clearing land, I could see a firewood processing machine in his future.
How can we as humans justifiably accept felling trees for a drive way when it harms our wildlife.
I am starting to feel left behind. A few back andrew and I had similar things
Awesome job, NC USA 🇺🇸
Hey Andrew, have you ever considered getting your own Semi and trailer? At this point you have enough heavy equipment moving around that it would probably pay off in the long run to transport it yourself.   I assume you already have your Class A given the size of your newer flat bead trailer, you at lest have your Class B because of your Tri-axle dump truck.
Nice video. I liked how you cleaned up the woodpile. You'll want one of those rotating logging grapples though. (;
Those built in guardrails are awesome!
Isn’t it amazing how much easier the work becomes when the equipment matches the needs? 👍
I’ve enjoyed your projects on the mountain but it is enjoyable to see you back on a customer project.
. Una vez más, sin subtítulos traducidos... .
hi
7:42 wow that notepad though...
I’m surprised how much balls that machine has for its size and that it’s a Hyundai lol
Awesome video Andrew !   Quite impressive you eyeballed the entire dig....great video and I like that you're buying newer machines.
Hi Andrew, long time I did not write anything, and you probably have no time to read them all anyway, it's not like at the begining!!! But just to tell you that I like this excavator pretty much, almost as much as your Kubota, I just love the Kubota for the size and versatility, but this one is bigger, QUESTION: is it because of the size or they make them like that, no blades on this size excavator? I really would like you to explain the different options available on different size of excavators, you are now the proud owner of a pretty size collection!!!
Was there sticker shock on the fuel cost?
Who needs a chain saw😊👍😃
When did he buy a TL8?
The Hyundai excavator looks like to be a pretty good machine for you. Hope it continues to work out for future jobs 👍🏻👍🏻
Beautiful new machine
Zero clearance Hyundai unit, wonder if Andrew will notice a leverage/power transfer issue...and I love how he is using the drone to use geometry to assess grade and elevation in the roadway construct.
9 years old! Maybe actually watch the video...
At 16:30 rate above where he is dining you could easily make a face in the rocks     Love your videos
I don't understand why you want to replace the driveway. I like the first driveway.
I miss LEVI 😪😪😪
I wasn't too happy with the Hyundai's I've ran, kinda janky cheap junk... fast though, especially compared to my own elderly Hitachi, Anyhow careful with the swing motor, they bolts and pins have a habit of breaking off on them, and you probably already noticed the missing teefs on the thumb.
Wahoo! a new paid job i thought you had stopped doing them and just worked on your own projects now, glad you are still doing different things.
where is the "and then it broke part"? what is going on here.
Andrew, very  nice video. Guess I missed the video where you explained your over all plans for the mountain you have. Anyway, really enjoy your activities and the dogs also are nice, I really like dogs... Sam
Awesome video.  Keep them coming.  Projects you work on are super interesting to the rest of us!  💪👍🏼
Nice job Andrew
To become a good excavator operator, it takes skill, knowledge and experience. You only throw money around.
These are my favorite videos. Great job.
So excited for a new upload!!!!!!!!!!
Finally you got a digger with a thumb xD
What do you do for water runoff mitigation?
Andrew..Half man Half Machine.
Nicely Done. Thanks for Sharing
That new excavator is awesome.  You'll have fun with that!
Thanks for telling us what you had to pay. Thats Awesome
🤣  Lol, April fools guys!   By the way, great looking coach, great interior .  It will be such a treat to have a new coach.
When he said 71, does that mean $71,000?
Love watching you work. Gotta remember to not work with the weight on your final drives. Another project in the books. Cool.
That's a nice excavator. As an excavator owner for 2 years for my personal use, I must say there is a huge different in knowing how to operate one and knowing what to do with it. I would have started at the bottom and worked up. That shows how much I don't know about how to do certain things. Watching Andrew is how to learn such.
You always do amazing work.
$1,350,000?? That's a working man's Bugatti Andrew I love it! That Bugatti can't work for it!!!
Great Looking machine Andrew, good luck.
And scientists still think people actually built the pyramids!!! Now that's funny Thank God Hyundai builds heavy equipment better than their cars???
you missed your calling I like how you explain geometry at the beginning. world needs math teachers!
that's a nice machine, not that loud really smooth engine. I'm surprised Volvo or any other company haven't reached out to him to give him a loaner or something. Great video Andrew!
Love your work .. see every video you've posted ..  Have a question .. is it legal to cut all those trees ? do you have to plant replacement trees somewhere else ?  Thanks
Well Andrew I got to say brother you got a nice looking Hyundai there and I think I'd do a job for you anywhere but anyhow it's about freaking time we get to see you out here man I've been watching you for the last oh my god for years I think So keep up and go to work brother you do fine maybe when I get some property I'll have you come out and clear me up some spots Okie doke take care brother we want to see more keep going
Finally a working video👍 Why not use the dozer ? just curious.
Did you guys think of bury them long rocks straight up and down on the outside of the steeper side of the driveway? I would say close to three quarters of the length in the ground.
I don't know why you didn't turn on the Arabic language, do you?
What a beast nice machine congratulations!!!
I have put a lot of hours on Hyundai excavators,keep up with services and they last a long time!most of the models I ran were Cummins powered,can’t kill them!
Nice bumper on the Dodge! That one shouldnt fold in half like the old one
Or you could just use a clinometer.
Thanks Andrew for your vid 📷🌞💗💗💗 love and bless you guy.
Nice piece of equipment and awesome job Andrew
Fastest 37 minutes on the internet.
I've had two Hyundais. They were both pretty good cars. 😁
Thank you  ,  Andrew  .  🐺
Pity you can't get your own prime mover & trailer to haul your gear around Andrew.
Can't wait for computerized new toys and special gonna be fun wen they break and Andrew have to repair them !😜
GREAT video Andrew. Please do a part 2 video with spreading gravel with your white dump truck. Thanks and keep up the good work!!
Man I love AC videos on a lazy Sunday!!
That thing is a beast-
GOOD JOB
Awesome,thank you 👍👍👍👍
That is one big driveway. Love watching heavy equipment.
Road looks really good except for a ridge about forty feet downhill from the big rocks on the downhill side of the road close to the top. Do you need to put up erosion fence on a job like that?
👍
Well done as usual.
Every hydraulic, mechanical , movement on Andrew's machines means $$.  Learn how to drive like this guy and you too........will do well.
why did that guy need another driveway again?  and what does he do for a living?
When did you put that front bumper on your truck ?
Looks like a nice machine and it looks like you’ll have heat and air for a change. A nice perk from the boss.  😂
Thank you for another cool video, Andrew. Yes, I know what it's like where you are- I'm just down the Thruway a few miles, Exit 31. I used to drive out to the Hudson valley area sometimes for my route. Capital region, Southern Tier, Tri-State area. All this area was under an enormously deep prehistoric ocean. The Finger Lakes are scars of the ice retreating. Near me is a Village named Waterville, NY. Fossils of Bivalves, Trilobites, etc. Sedimentary rock (shale) is miserable stuff. It's not "real dirt" when you think about it. Might as well try to plant a garden in the Great Salt Lake bed. I admire your effort, the content and production are spot on as usual. I really enjoy long, thoughtfully produced videos about something I'm interested in.
these videos for real men are like the girls making asmr vids for pervs XD
Will you put some kind of rail on open side incase snow an ice decides to take auto where don't want to go
Congratulations on the new excavator Andrew I have to say your video editing skills are top notch like no other on YouTube. You have sure come a long way I have been watching from the beginning and always look forward to seeing your videos I hope they come more frequently now that springtime is here.
When did you get that skid steer?
Good to see he got one he did not have to fix before a job.
Dang cool good job on that driveway I like the big stones at the edge that excavator looks like it works pretty good 👍
@bartfarm … hui dachte zuerste: neues video von euch :-)
Great video 👍👍
Nice new toy! Always a pleasure to see you post Andrew 😎👍
Nice job. Never seen that done before at least not on the side of a mountain.
I would have gotten the Kia one
Nice!!!  Sweet new Excavator man, awesome work!
Thanks!
awesome job buddy love that new piece of machinery wow
Nice  I love those excavators with no tail swing
I'm not a fan of Hyundai or Korean made products other than SSD /M2 DRIVES.   Hope this will prove me wrong.
Thanks for another great video. What a beast the new X is!!
I need an excavator that can pull 60 foot trees out of the ground
Your going to like that excavator nice size for what you do and it's zero turn. Nice
I have enjoyed watching you do all the things you do but I'm not waiting for my own excavator to start doing all the projects I have been struggling with because I didn't have an excavator only a small 4wd loader
great idea giving hrs. and cost on new/old equipment. thought about asking you to do this so me and my pencil neck buddies out there in the tubes could better  understand cost . plus helps customers know what it cost to gear up to do your work and bolster you hourly bids .
I didn't get much of a look at the undercarriage, but if that machine was maintained with 4,000 hours it was a steal at around $74,000.  Congrats!
Andrew,that Hyundai is a great purchase,and is a fantastic addition to your fleet!!!💯👍👍👍👍
This is so fun to watch.  Can't wait to watch this stuff live next week when we have a giant excavator come in with a grabber and chainsaw attachment and clear 70 trees or so on our property.  Gonna channel my inner Camarata and make a video of it, naturally.
At last! A paid outside job like you used to do in your old videos..
The trees in your neighbor are alot easier to push over than in the midwest . We don't have rock around here and the trees have deep roots .
Good job!!!😂👍👍
Dragging up that rock make a nice screed.
That was fun to watch. The dogs loved it too.
Very cool edit style and tunes in this one
all the best with the new excavator Andrew
im guessing that machine uses 3 to 5 gallons an hour
love that layer like rock, here in lower bavaria we just have hard rock
хороший Hyundai
I also have a Hyundai excavator, best bang for the buck!
Really good video quality Exceptional*
4K looks awesome.
G'Day from down under Andrew, I see you are starting early getting your 'handrails' installed nice to see a new video from the hardest worker on you tube 😊😊
Pretty cool Andrew using the drone to do trigonometry to calculate the slope of the driveway 🙂 I didn’t know the drone gave you that data. That’s super cool👍
⭐🙂👍
Another great video sir, thanks for bringing us along on this project.   Love how you positioned the slabs of rock rather than just pushing them off or over the hillsides.   Wishing you and your furry duo another great week, gentle seasonally appropriate weather and restful evenings.   Peace brother
hello andrew its is randy and i like yours video is cool and digging in a driveway  with a new excavator super thanks andrew friends randy
Wenn, die da so weiter machen, ist in 10-20 Jahren von dem Wald nicht mehr viel übrig.
Hyundai is the most unreliable manufacturer in the world. I'd go with Hitachi or Volvo.
Andrew, that was a fantastic job!
What the ballpark cost for a roughed in drive like this
Nice work. That excavator is sweet. Hopefully it lasts long for you without any major problems.
Why do these pieces of equipment come up for sale?  Are they sold after so many hours, repossession, out of business?  That yellow dog is nuts and a bad influence on the other one. I might take it to a vet and have it fixed and get it on some meds.
Is that machine pre-Def? They should call that shit Death not Def.
I know this isn’t your property, you know what I mean.😊
Best way to determine the hypotenuse of a triangle I’ve ever seen.
Great video! Would using a chain be quicker when hauling the trees back up the hill? Just a thought..
"So this driveway is kinda  steep, so we are going to make it kinda level".....gotta love Andrew's approach, no pun intended 😜.
Sou fã dos seus vídeos 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏👏👏👏💯💯💯💯💯
I wonder if that thumb has a bad hose? The first time you closed it it squealed like it was maybe de-laminating internally.
wish it was an hitachi😔
My man is amazing. Never scared to take on a project and does the work of 10 man crews.
0 swings are great...only problem is working on them can be frustrating
All in a Days worth of Work 😅
Big toys are better then small           Great V Andrew
Was wondering when you were going to upgrade to some modern equipment
Your “rock” is interesting stuff…I live on the Canadian Shield, or in other words SOLID granite. If you need a hole plan on blasting, a lot!
I need a new drive on my property in Clarkridge Ark. but being an unemployed severely disabled Firefighter/EMT doesn't pay well. Great property terrible 1,000' driveway. You do good work.
Once again, awesome video. I must tell you Andrew, you made my bucket list young man, I would like to just shake your hand. One day I hope to do just that. Keep up the great work and I can already see your property in 5 years, absolutely amazing. Like to know how you planned it all, and it doesn’t just stop there. ❤ you man…
New to Andrew means that it doesn’t have a pony motor😊
nice job andrew, good to see you again.
Best excavating & construction channel on YouTube .
is that 7100 or 71000 he paid??  Thanks
Nice job. That new driveway route is certainly going to be easier with snow/ice around.
You should get either Engcon or Rototilt tiltrotator for that Hyundai, makes your job much more efficient, faster and easier, definitely a quality of life upgrade.
A new piece of equipment video with zero repairs. Nice work on the road.
Hi Andrew, all you need now is a bigger truck and low loader trailer.? certificate III holder,  biggest excavator and front end loader, and skid steer operator. WA
🍿😎🔥💯🍻 great vid.
Where's that skidder when you need it.
That thing is a monster….😬
Awesome work on the new driveway for the owner. Love seeing the dogs out there playing while you work. Congratulations on getting you a new toy to play with and uses with work😊
A great machine and a great video. thanks for that Andrew
With the rate that you buy new equipment I'm almost convinced that your buisiness is front for selling drugs😁
Andy finally in the big leagues . Now he can do some big jobs.
Nice machine there andrew
I'm really surprised case hasn't got with Andrew on demoing the new  Minotaur 550, that guy sure puts equipment to the test
That excavator is beast, nothing stops it .
finally we have been waiting for such jobs
See the face on the side of the rock 17:02😮
Do you have to get permits to do that ?
How much a job like that run your customer, all said and done?
Sure is mighty rusted for "new"
That is a nice new addition to your fleet!
Those sure look like perfect stones to make your own stonehenge.
Andrew, you've gone soft on us, the excavator probably has Air Conditioning and Heat, Nice machine!
Yeah machine ain’t old enough for andrew
Great machine and a nice job.....and I just loved the sound of that big lorry pulling away sans excavator. Great stuff.
Very Good JOB you All
Andrew, did Dirt Perfect’s videos influence your choice of excavator? He has a model 210.
Great video keep up the awesome work you do.  Question I require a Drone can you please tell me what type you use and the other Drone that was used?
Awesome video thanks for sharing awesome new excavator😊
Nice project on that steep slope!
Nice..😂..ya goofy m8te from Australia
Só excited to see a new video from Andrew and it’s building mountain roads.
That new piece of equipment is moving that material very easily
The dogs should each have their own GPS around their necks 😉.  Nice excavator.
these gradiant problems are making me appreciate my property that is well within 1 m of elevation change.
nice machine and great job  andrew!!! its yours the new excavator?
👍👍
Andrew, are you farming out your editing? The music choices the last few videos seem very different.
👍
Andrew not many operators could visualize a driveway going up a small mountain but you confidently can. Quite impressive you eyeballed the entire dig....great video and I like that you're buying newer machines. None of my business but I hope you sell off your older equipment you don't use anymore. Great video!!
Hey Andrew and land-owner. I have a question that might sound odd to you (and sorry for my maybe acceptable but not perfect english): Is it obligatory to have permissions by local authorities or environmental authorities for making such a new driveway? I mean, this all seems to be a private property. So, can you do almost whatever the landowner wants? In germany it´s very complicated to get permissions which include taking down for example trees and sealing a paveway... Greetings.  🍻
*"overburden"*
Ice excavator Andrew
I like your storys but , when you look at the big picture 37:05 , was it really useful ...????
Who’s TL8 is that?
AWESOME!
At this rate Andrew you should buy a truck and a lowboy of your own.
fab video , and what nice rocks !!
No grease oil and filter on a new piece of equipment you're getting lazy in your old age their Andrew LOL
Surveying but drone
Nice use of trig great video. I like to see more of the math and science rather than just winging it. I know the math shows whether it’s feasible it’s the actual build process that shows what is truly possible.
Sure is good to see you putting in some videos on YouTube great job as always
👍
Looking forward to the Excavator Video Fluids Change and Maintenance. Great Camera work from the Home Owner&Andrew. Only 37 min Video Felt like an hour of great video magic from Andrew. Thanks for all your hard work you put into all your Videos Andrew!!.
In Deutschland bräuchte man dafür ca 5 Jahre Planungszeit,plus 2 Jahre Juristische Einsprücheaufarbeitung von Umweltschützern,Krötenautobahnbauern und sonstige Straßenankleberaktivisten!😅😊
That's a great deal for that machine Congrats can't wait to run it  💪
Looks like a lot of dead trees. Did you guys have some sort of blight in the area?
WOW!! Andrew actually bought a newer Excavator!! SWEET! and what it can do is amazing. Nice to see Andrew finally getting back to JOBs again. Site was awesome in that is has so much of the naturul blue rock and sale that you can just resue as a driveway. for a rough cute, looked really nice, though that one section, think maybe could of cut into just a bit more, but otherwise, Great Job, and again His professionalism shines though. Sweet Video Andrew!
That Emerald Ash Bore is terrible! What a shame! It will take a while to replant. Nice work as usual and nice Find on that Excavator!
Nice job 👌
Dear Mr. Camarata. 👍👌👏 Well done again. 2) The relatively new big and strong excavator is obviously capable of even handling really big/heavy rocks. Very impressive. 3) I absolutely love your dogs, especially Blue. 💚💚 Obviously each time only one wood stick = the same, is interesting enough, that it's worth fighting for. Although the forest is full of sticks. 😁😁 Thanks a lot for making teaching explaining recording editing uploading and sharing. Best regards luck and especially health to all involved life forms (humans and dogs).
Nice new machine, may I suggest a larger counter balance.
Excavator #7 or #8? This one certainly looks like a good'n. Congratulations on your business progress.
Love it! Thank you
do you like you apple watch
The Lab Inspectors are such a nice addition to your work!
Andy, how is the pushing and breakout power of the Tak TL8R vs the TL10? Looks like it gets the job done!
👍💪🏻👌🏻👏👏
lolz.  andrew needs to get a lidar drone to do all this stuff automatically
I didn't think you were going to lift some of those large rocks . Nice job Andrew
Andrew at his best!
I like the new bumper, can't wait to see a video on it.
Good show using your drone making elevations
Great engineering and excavation job Andrew.  You made short work of a big job and entertaining to boot!  Already looking forward to your next great adventure.  Good luck to you and the boys!
Andrew buys excavators like I buy shoes...
Enjoy the video Andrew and like the new exc . new road .
Andrew's "new" excavator is like owning a car made in the same decade you're currently living in! 😂😂😂
Nice job, old boy looking good 👍🏻.
You could build a bat cave up there !!
Nice purchase and a great video, as usual !
Mesmerizing!
Rock: I'm not moving. I've been here for thousands of generations. Andrew: We'll see about that! 😂😂
HELLO FRIEND ANDREW, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOUR VIDEOS AGAIN, I WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET BECAUSE THIS HAD BEEN CUT OFF BUT WITH EFFORT I MANAGED TO PAY IT AND HERE I AM AGAIN, THINGS ARE VERY STRONG IN MY COUNTRY ALMOST ALL OUR MONEY GOES FOR FOOD AND IT IS NOT EASY TO CARRY THE LOAD OF THE HOUSE, GREETINGS FROM VENEZUELA A GREAT AND GENEROUS LAND... ..
Great job Andrew and what looks like a nice addition to your fleet. Dogs look so happy and content as always.
Ending scene is beautiful
andrew is the only guy who would take his new tight excavator to the mountain to carry some boulders that are much too big for it lol
Your vids and footage are awesome. Nice machine right there. Looks like it did everything you asked of it.
Nice job.  I especially like the videos that have an objective and I can watch how you go at the job.
Andrew, if you could only have one machine; either a skid/track loader OR an excavator, which one would you choose?
I think I see a semi with a lowboys trailer in Andrew's future. Just saying.
hard to believe youre up to one and a quarter million subs now....i remember watching you had almost nothing other than some old riding mowers and a lot of ambition 👍
great video!
Now, for a Rotobec grapple for those project with Timber….awesome video!
Nice unit, how stable is that Hyundai compared to standard tail excavators?
We didn't inspect the new rig like all the others, and why aren't we blasting this rock , and why putting the driveway on the edge of the hill, just wondering??
34:45 There are ten thousands similar sticks in the couple of square feets area but they are fighting over that specific one,lmao.
I like the new excavator.  Nice job as always.  Thanks for the Sunday treat.
The "Glass guy's" property, I think? Good job and nice new machine. 👍
That looks great!!! I was working on cleaning up the 1000nd  1000 year flood damage on my driveway with the 763 skid steer! Great fun!!!
Nuther surprise. Cracking video, great looking new machine, looks like a good deal too. Keep em coming Andrew, always great to watch, thanks :)
Andrew has an Apple Watch?! Never saw him wear one before 🔥
Cody and Blue steals the video.  great job on building the new road with ur new 295 excavator.  she does the job great..
14:05 yes!  Back to Andrews edits. ❤❤❤❤❤😊
Awesome video Andrew !
$71K?? how does he afford this in addition to all the other equipment?
Terrible editing. 11:50 I thought you were going down the hill. Now we are back at the top???   This can’t be Andrew editing it. 😢😢😢😢❤
Where does he get those wonderful toys?! 😁😅😂
Great video mate thanks , Why is it that you don’t see large excavators with a front blade ? Seems like it would be handy to have or is there a reason for not fitting them ……cheers from OZ .
Really a nice machine,you should get many years of service.
Andrew just wondering on a job like this is flat rate or time & materials eitheer way wat was the charge for a 390 ft drive way ???-- approx $13,300--or ??? CONGRATES ON UR NEW MACHINE LOOKS AND SOUNDS SUPER
Thanks
Forreal though I wanna see you get a "cybertruck" you'd use it like a truck and we couldd see if it is actually aa "truck" that is if it is ever released
This video is almost too choppy for my attention deficit disorder to handle. Let’s go back to the old school edits please. 😢😢😢
Those “ sunroofs “ are rather dangerous. A false sense of security. If a tree top finds its way through it might end up in your lap. Point to ponder. Ty
So... U buy a new machine for every project theese days?
🇳🇴👍👍👌
So did you sell the koehring?
Same as calculating the pitch of a roof . Divide the rise by the run formula .
3/2/23; ..another interesting obsticle laden (giant sandstone) steep hill side project..no problem for AC & Dogs C & B.  Love your use of drones & trig functions for topographic layout of up/down hill roadway for access. Hope to see you back here with one of your CAT Dozers widening this new road then fabric & gravel. Owner gotta love your practical  approach from a guy with tons of practical experience & all equipment necessary. Always love to see your videos, a 'must watch' whenever you publish. Stay safe & carry on !👍👍👍👏⚙️🔧💪👷🍷😊
Wait, 7100 or 71000?
No plow 😮
At first I thought it was going to be too steep, but it looks like it’s just right.  Great job with the new Hyundai.
See you at beaver farm auction
Very good job. Lookin' forward to part two and connect it up with his other driveway.
Future video idea. A clock showing how long it takes.
Andrew loved the video best wishes and warmest regards sp
stop killing tree u fkng barbarian!
Ладушки!!!
Hopefully the inspectors at the end of the video didn’t bust your stones too bad. They are some pretty tough inspectors!!🚜🐾
This is a huge investment, Andrew!!!💪💪💪
Should have spent another $250,000 and got a nice Volvo!
Good  job
Nice vid, good explanation of what you are doing and the drone shots also helped to visualize the project.
good job
Thanks.😀
It's amazing how you can rough out a driveway like that in a relatively short time. I think the homeowner is going to want to put some gravel on the new portion of the driveway. Otherwise, it will be a mess after a rain or when the snow melts. Nice work, Andrew!
I think its time to buy a truck and lowboy.
This episode reminds me of a you tube channel called Drone B where these guys use excavators and back hoes to create and maintain roads in the mountains of Nepal.
New equipment ? You earned it buddy.
$71,000 ??????????????
Gran trabajo 💪
Man he's going to have a whole lot of firewood
they need a car lift
When are we gonna see another car/truck maintenance video, like the Suzuki trooper or your dodge truck?
Now you got a nice machine! I call it a extremely good deal.. looks like lots of power and for a zero turn seems very stable. Now you gotta get something to haul it around lol. Great video buddy!
Andrew likes to prove that you can dig a road with a bricklayers trowel rather than with one of his bulldozers....   Go Babe !!!
Congratulations on your new acquisition! You will thoroughly be happy with the 235 with its power and breakout Force I'm not sure if it says fuel efficient as a smaller model like the 220 however it sure is a game-changer with time
Your two labs are the best!
Thanks
Great video as usual Andrew, love the new machine!
I thought at first Hyundai gave Andrew a machine to play with just like Dirt Perfect and UpState Brush Control.
Glad to see a new post. Missed seeing Cody, Blue and you. It makes me smile watching them tugging on a stick. They have so much fun together. Thanks for including them in your vids. I had my doubts when you first showed where you were going to cut the new driveway. It turned out great. That loose rock was a blessing. Like your new machine. Great video production work.
50 over 212 is 23.6% and 46 over 386 is 11.9% or less than half of the existing driveway.
He needs a rotating bucket now
That’s a cool way to figure out your numbers & grades with the drones technology makes life easier every day for the most part. Have u ever watched NYA millennial on YouTube n how he figureds out jobs n grades for dirt perfect n bids jobs it’s cool to with the software he uses to awesome man
Curious why you don't use your CAT D7/9? buldozer. Thanks for the video.
Maybe a truck like dumpster dave has ?? Dodge(U'v had a couple) , 4 dr, diesel, off road fuel tank in bed, lockers, etc !
Nice machine .
VERY  VERY NICE JOB, HE Sure Got The BEST GUY For The Job !!! 👍👍👍
17:30 "There's your new conference table, boss!"
Congratulations on the new machine.
That was a fantastic job as always, Andrew.  Looking forward to the next video at this site for putting down some gravel.
Thanks Andrew Always interesting
So Andrew....what's a job like that cost the homeowner?
Andrew. Great to see you back in action. You haven’t lost the knack of operating that equipment. Good luck with the new back hole . Great video. 👍
All right!)
Put a chain around multiple trees and hook them on the bucket. Pull them back up the hill.
Great video! both the excavator and the road look Awesome! :)
Very nice job, takes a good operator to do this.
You tube must be paying well
Wow  Andrew    stunning new excavator   👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
Doing it The AC Way !!! Go Andrew another piece of equipment added to your fleet .
Tune in next week to see what neat tool Andrew adds to his collection! :)
GREAT JOB  ANDY !!!
Good job made easier with the newer equipment - take big flat shale stone down for an address ID.  Andrew at his best.
You bought something that doesn't  need  fixing first
👍👍👍!!!
Доброго здоров'я привіт з України! Дякуємо за вашу працю! Героям Слава!
Andrew,  is it about time to buy urself a newer(maybe not brand new) pick up, ext cab or four door for the dogs to spread in..   u know what u need and what u want,  just something newer(motor, trans, interior), less damage on the outside(and would look better when u show up to do those side jobs)?!!
You are probably going to get to it but how will you drain this drive to insure it does not have washouts?
👍
Great timing. I was just bored to death 😀
yay, a new toy
Nice to see you back Andrew 😁and now with "brand new excavator" good video 👍
Nice job and nice machine. But you need a proper gradingbucket so you can get a nicer finish, and stop playing with that toy dozer. 6 or 7 feet with tilt, would suit the machine.
Fuck me, you must be rolling in the YouTube cash 😱
Get a clinometer(suunto makes great ones) quick and easy to use for road grades or any grades for that matter
What is wrong with these trees in this region? Why are they all dry and looking so awful?
👍👍👍👍👍 🧹
The slope calculation is super easy friend. Just divide the change in elevation by the change in horizontal position and multiply by 100. You'll then have a % slope number.
RETIRED 78, USAF, VFW. NICE!
Look what one human can do to an environment that took 12000 years to build.
I love the new bumper on the Ram.
Hydraulic booster for the thumb it's to slow???
Nice machine
34:40 “This world is not big enough for two branch managers like us and the one and only desired branch.”
how much were you paid for this job?
Hyundai? Yes, Hyundai. Is that considered a mountain or a hill? Nice to see ya.
luv to see part deux!
That new excavator looks good, nice not having to fix anything.  The hoses look good, the whole thing looks tight without any slop, and that thumb has some power.  That's got to be one of the nicest rigs in the fleet.  I liked the drone measurements, that makes it nice, and more accurate.  G-d bless, and yes, I'd like to see this driveway finished, nice to see you out on a job.
36:00 they have to fight over the same stick when there’s millions around them 😂
Хорошая дорога!!!
Real nice addition to the fleet!
You need a spider excavator 😂
Next video will be repairing cracked boom on new excavator lol
Great job Andrew. Can't wait to see more. Have a great day and thanks for sharing.
Nice the new machine is a short body/ swing
Hi Andrew , I am proud to say , I know you could walk away from Us , And I am so happy your not . its good to hear and see you doing what you do best . Keep on Keepin on !
That was a lot faster than I expected
Thank you , love your all of your videos.
andrew good excevator
Glad to see ya back at work! I know your working all the time.
Thumb looks too slow. Look and see if there is a flow control in it that's turned down ..
Lets keep watching, new toys movement ...
YES the Hyundai is awesome. Already gives a crispy feel to the scraping your putting on...aaawweeesccttrrrrchsome🎉
my first thought was, hmm looks also very steep, then u smoothed it out
Congratulations on the new machine good luck with it and makes more money with it
Awesome video Andrew. Nice excavator.
It will cost about 71,000 $ !!!! Am I right ?????  Wow, most expensive Andrew
yeah that driveway needs a lot more work to be safe... wouldn't want to send someone i loved down it in the ice and snow. but its a start
That Hyundai is a great addition ! Pt. 2 would be good ! Cheers
يجب عليك شراء معدات ثقيلة للقيام باعمال على شكل جيد
whats that measuring thing on the drone
All the bigger equipment you need a truck and lowboy
Excellent !
Machine already needs an undercarriage
👍👍👍👋👋👋👋
Hi Andrew.    Nice job, good machine you  got there.     Do you think a choker and cable might make it easier to drag those trees?     Again nice job.     Ed from Chicago 🙂
Great to see hard working people do well.
Congrats to the new excavator Andrew😃😀👍🙏
What are your thoughts on not having a blade on an excavator? Seems like that would be handy to have on these kind of jobs?
I would get the tracking collars for the dogs.
Isn’t it funny how hard it is sometimes to explain what you are doing to someone else . It’s all so logical to you but it was nice to see him being in awe and getting the picture as you progressed . The first time I saw your channel was years ago and you were putting in a long drive to the site where they were going to build a house . I was so impressed with how you were such a one man crew to the point you had to keep jumping out of one machine to another . Laying down the black plastic sheeting then having to go and get your gravel  then lay it .  You hadn’t built your house but you had a plan and you knew how to achieve it so I just watched you job after job and this video feels like I’m reminiscing but with a bigger mean machine. X
Great work you will probably knock off that shale outcrop in the near future.  Good stone and a wider road because it will surely come down in time
With all of the equipment Andrew has it's time for a semi and lowboy
Nice new machine.  I'm guessing that this 3rd attempt at a reasonably shallow sloping driveway is so that it isn't so difficult to get up and down in the winter? Wouldn't it be cheaper/easier to buy a 4x4?
Went from 13deg to slightly over 8deg slope. Will be a nice improvement for the homeowner.
I am simply amazed at how those large slabs of "rock" fracture into these little layers when you apply pressure.  Simply amazed.
MORE POWER !!!  Andrew the "toolman" Camarata
$71,000 ??
I love my mavric pro2
$7100?  We would never find a machine like that for under $25,000 in Minnesota.
Howlong does it take to do a job that size?
Awesome 😎 🌵🌵
Would you ever consider getting your own semi and lowboy for this bigger machinery,  or have you pretty much drawn the line there with the 10 wheeler and the blue trailer? You already have the CDL and in terms of driving skill you can't be far off at all from having what it takes to drive that. I assume you've looked into it and done the math already. I'd be curious to know what the numbers are for if you'd save any money or not by buying you're own instead of paying people to transport your machines for you. Guess it depends how often you need the stuff moved around which seems to be not often. I guess we would've seen a "buying and fixing and semi" video some time ago now if you concluded it to be worth doing.
At what size of excavator does a blade become.....well.....not  needed,  too heavy for the machine....or not useful enough... 😊
What do you charge for a job like that?
Sry to bother you, but the outer part of your road will eventually slip down under pressure. Driveway should be cut in to the hillside with horizontal benches.
I wish Michigan had excavators for 7,100.00 like this one.
funny how some posts are older then the time since the video has been up
👍🌞👍Endelig en ny fra Andrew. Dypt savnet. Å så en ny maskin. Ser ut som den har nok av krefter. 👍🌞👍🤗
The constant movement of the shot is giving me vertigo. Gotta set a scene and let it play out, maybe just get a b-roll camera with a 10-18mm lens. That would be the ticket.
...unreal fortnite... ü
Good work Andrew )))👍😎🤝
Why  not make the road way little bit wider
Andrew, how much do paid for the excavator?
Nice machine
Can you put a 360 knuckle on the excavator?
Yes very nice excavator seems to be able to handle a big job .Great job done on the rough in driveway well done sir Andrew thank you for the video
I still wait for the day where Andrew gets his own semi truck with a flatbed trailer for his oversize equipment. XD  And did i hear right, that this excavator can use a Tilt-Bucket? Like a Encon Tiltrotor? If yes, THAT will be really useful. A skilled operator like Andrew can eat his lunch with this attachment.   19:50 Whow, that tree was surely dead for a LONG time.
Poor little tree
Definitely an improvement over the second driveway. The new excavator certainly made the job way easier to accomplish in a relatively short time compared to having to use his older equipment.  Just needs some heavy plastic ground cover put down then 4 to 6 inches of gravel on top rolled in with Andrew's roller like Chris Letsdig18 does it. A couple of those huge flat rocks at the bottom to be address stones would have been really cool. With them facing opposite ways. Chris did that on his homestead with flat rocks he got ffom a huge rock removal job for a hillside Vetenary building.
Do you need a permit for this?
Another great job 👏
Very nice. Kind of funny looking with such a tiny counterweight. But it is probably designed for less overhang I suppose? Edit ; yepp, and thats me, commenting before the video is done :-)
Big rocks make a nice guardrails
Thanks for the video Andrew, you rock
sell me a dozer
That drive needs a date with the small dozer.
Good Luck with the really-cool-super-duper excavator Andrew! I wish I had one of those and some land to muck about, I'd be playing like a little kid in a sandbox hahaha
Been on jobs with 10 guys on a similar project. Most just leaned on shovels and "mombacked" all day....The boss never pulled the phone from his ear and pointed his finger alot....while the customer kept checking out the six figure dually. Here we have just Andrew......wow!
Is the Hyundai gonna replace the old EX120 ??
👍👍👍
That new machine is amazing
What ever Happened to the Coal Bin?  What Does that Look like Now
Good job
That’s one cool machine… I do like the brand … powerful tough and reliable..
Good Job 👍🏻
How do you choose the size of excavator to use? The clueless kid in me would say why not go with the biggest one you have, but I'm sure there's a reason.
Nice you plenty of rock on site so that saves a ton of money for the client. Next tool to buy is a grader attachment for the skid steer. Run the vibratory roller on the skidsteer on this road and add rock were needed and this will last for ever.
Love the new piece of equipment!
just look how far you have come! well done
The 70s/80s music on point. The new toy is awesome congrats
Is going to be a snow plowing video.
All that practice on Mt. Camarata is paying off ...land development box ☑
Rise over run boys rise over run
The difference between men and boys is just the price of their toys…. The green-roof out-bldg up top seems to be in need of some repairs lol
Well done on your Hyundai machine. Give it some love please. You need to buy a nice low boy to truck your machines around. Lots of Auctions. You may end up with something good
Cheers to for giving Montano so much business great company, im in poukeepsie love the content
Thanks!
NOW we’re going to see how tough the Hyundai REALLY is😂
Dig out a nice parking lot with a garage at the bottom covered set stairs to get you to the main house could work to ???
Damn! hes going to own his own mining equipment soon!
Pretty sure that you are going to need a lowboy trailer to haul some of your equipment to job sites it’s not getting any cheaper to hire someone to haul all the equipment you own to a job site
Andrew is playing the game “ the one with the most toys at the end wins the game”.  I think he is well ahead.
Another quality video ... from the working man's   ... Tony Robbins!
I thought a bulldozer might be more efficient on this job.
A trommel would be good to get the soil out the rock
You make it look easy.
Hives are subsiding,,,,,,,&,,,,, the safety shirt is on!!!
Thanks Andy! 🎉
welcome 🤗
Which drone are you using
I never thought andrew would be using downtown binary music at the end of the video. 36:21
you need a civil engineer.
As the first scene unfolded, my original thought was, “What did the cat bring in!”  🤨
71 dollars for that thing? That was a steal. jk 🙂
nice stout excavator, nice earth moving.
No repair required    Wtf Hyundai are good machines 👍
So much easier to just buy excavators and have them shipped to the job instead of moving them LOL! Great vid as always!
It's weird seeing Andrew buying new equipment or vehicles that aren't 20 plus years old.
Andrew, with the amount of major earthworks you do at elevation on some serious land and the use of drones have you heard of DJI RTK and also the benefits of topographical surveying and 3D mapping for work just like you are doing here. Great Video
did we just have a drone capturing video of a drone ?!?
Using the Cam cam.
Going big, does the Hyundai have the 10/100000 warranty?
😊🇯🇲🇯🇲 new toy
Now Andrew do not scratch it all up and break it 💥💥
71 hundred or 71 thousand dollars? It must be the former, right ?
It looks very new
keep up with the awesome videos bro
1:31 you paid 71 thousand dollars for it?
Boys never actually grow up. Their toys just get bigger and more expensive. Awesome video Andrew !
Wait you paid 71000 for this? Seems a tad high
Congrats man enjoy that YouTube money
ANOTHER TOY FOR THE COLLECTION
Yeah.. was looking forward to this!
Sunday Monday Hyundai
I was literally just saying after watching an unlisted B video Andrew will upload today or tomorrow.
Wow, in only 8 minutes, this video has 3.5K views. This just proves you don't have to beg for subscribers or likes. I love camaratas videos.
Why did you need a new excavator????
The sound of the truck 🙃
New toys...fun
Where does he keep all these machines 💀
Ты где пропал
What did you mean by when you said “he’s going to have a circle driveway” who is he you were referring to?
Hey there Andrew.   Happy Sunday everybody!
🤍💛🧡
Hyundai. Excellent machine.
Nice! I just finished the unlisted b videos last night.
Coffees on!!Here weeeee go!!Cheers!;-)!!
