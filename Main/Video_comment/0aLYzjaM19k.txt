Best circuit ever made. 🇵🇹
Great job!
Big shout out to Mercedes and the team for doing these short Race debriefs there very interesting as I dont see any other teams doing them so good for you Merc
I liked it how he cautiously said Max was good. The undercut actually worked because of how good Max was in his outlap.
IT'S JAMES
9:08 lol and you'd wonder why it's rarely asked nowadays exept in  US. The answer that should be "good", or  "not too bad, and you?"
8:47 I appreciate the honesty.
Voted down for mild curry, shame on you 😂
Interesting watch & great to live through the #PortuguesGP double podium again 😎
Hold on! Did he just say the reason they won so many championships is 'Curry' nights?
repping the korma love you jamess
His pitstop time was actually trash. He was 8 tenth down on Verstappen & Hamilton.  3.4 secs. Why is valterri having so many issues with the car ?
Bottas' pit stop was 3.3s which was a whole second too much... being stationary for an additional whole second while Max was lapping at full speed made all the difference...
F for the patio furniture.  Hungry now after that last question 😂
These guys come on camera and make it look like they have been on camera forever. Go AMG!
Thanks for the debrief mate, shame about the sensor issue as you guys had the fastest race car last week, be interesting to see the battle between you and the Redbulls over the season, as different tracks may favor one or the other and of course upgrades :)
amazing little initiative to include some personal questions at the end, felt more human keep it going
This is my first time watching James..... I already love him ❤️ Awesome explaination ! Loved the video
Is one of the books Grosjean's cook book?
VALTERRI THIS IS JAMES
You forgot one thing in the title of the video...Bottas can't overtake in the fastest car on the grid
The rules prohibit the change of engine modes during a race, via the directive introduced to ban the use of multiple power unit modes. For safety reasons it's allowed to tune it down, but ones done that is the mode it remains in for the remainder of the race. In this it's pointed out that the software put the engine in a "safety mode" it recovered after the sensor failed. But in the mean time Mercedes was looking at ways to excluded the sensor. Is this then not the same as the engine is tuned down (not by the driver but due to a sensor). I wonder does this clash with directive 37? after x time you overload a sensor and if you are in a good position you leave it preserving the engine. If you are in a fight you overrule the sensor and get back to full power. I'm pretty sure I'm missing something here or that I missinterpret a rule or so, can someone help me out?
Will george go to mercedes team
Valteri basically lost his position to Max in the pitlane. Mercedes will need to step up their pitlane performance if this championship ends up coming down to the details.
I heard redbull is hiring Mercedes workers on their engine department. Is it cause any problem to Mercedes?.
How come Valleteris car always has a problem
Love all your race debriefs, its what I look forward to midweek after the race, I love the humor and the drive for excellence in all  you do. Great job Team Mercedes, Keep it coming, stay safe and be blessed.
All that talk about softs graining and difficulty maintaining temperature makes you appreciate Stroll getting 40 laps out of the things.
What measures does mercedes team engineers are putting in place for w12 to run on every tack to keep pace to win .😇
I'm concerned RBR has swayed 6 top staff from HPP to Milton Keynes.
Why Mercedes HPP people are leaving to Red bull engine division....
All the teams must watch previous year debriefs so that they can perform well😂
The only way would be to stop Valtteri earlier? He had a 3.3 second pit stop? Couldn't those 4 tenths you said he was lacking be made up by having a 2.9 second pit stop?
Mercedes-ASMR Petronas Formula One Tingles.
A lot of people called James at Mercedes
My family don't do spicy, and as everyone my brother James neither. I am the only one :) So I am not surprised with his answer, although I am sure Butter Chicken in my recipes has tomatoes in it :)
After every grand prix i will ve eagerly waiting for your debrief. I think the only team who care about is you guys. Hats off to your effort of understanding the auidence. Nice win LEWIS.
Kinda sus how Valteri always have some issues in all the grand prix and Lewis just zooms through the weekend without technical issues...1 unlucky RACE is acceptable...Valtteri's been having back to back unlucky SEASONS mind you
I feel you James on that tomato allergy :( I miss eating pasta and pizza.
Good to hear some of your strategies the ones that work and the ones that didn't.
hi James, has Lewis finally gotten in there or not?
Make an updated video on Curry Night. Love from India.
was that youg TOTO?
I really like James Allison in race debrief episodes
You should develop ai to recognize a bad sensor versus an actual engine problem. That way the engine doesn't go into limp mode
Redbulls guys after seeing this debrief: Why don't we invite the Merc strategy team for dinner Saturday night. We'll serve them Chinese dishes with lots of tomato sauce 😌
This was excellent. I mean, who better to answer questions about the race than James.
Note to the editor: Please don't to the "White fading" / pulsating on the images. It feels kind of weird.
The debrief just rounded off the Portugal race weekend 👍.
Honestly, these videos are amazing!!!!
İ take my words back mercedes still rules that was a serious gap right there between bulls in this race
Red Bull moaning about track limits, Those are the rules unfortunately, Red Bull is always keen to point out when Mercedes break a rule 🤔
These are great
Audio is toovlow
I don't recall any mention of Valtteri losing power in the highlights video, FOM being weird again I suppose.
The same happened in 2020 when Valterri set the fastest time in Q2.
Will it be good to have 2 exhaust sensors? ECU will read both, if both showing high temp then ECU will cut the power
Nothing like listening to this while trying to sleep
I'm sorry but Valtteri's pit stop time was not "very good." His stop was 3.3 seconds vs Lewis's 2.5. there are your 0.4 and then some
You just can't not love James and his calm, caring demeanour.
Thank you for the explanation, James! It's amazing how much the tyres matter even outside of the regular under/over cut strategies.
Keema naan ❤️
wind?? what is it, a badminton match?
Ty for your time in explaining all this! great job!
Not to be weird or anything but am I the only one who finds him very attractive?
i love your videos 😍
Will Mercedes's low rake concept problem still affect them in 2022?
The gear on the top shelf, what’s that from? Superb content making F1 much more interesting, ensuring the future of the sport, thank you🙏🙏
Schwarzenegger plays a terminator in a movie, Toto... does it in real life. I have no doubt he’s gonna terminate something by Thanksgiving. Maybe Arnold played Toto.
As a McLaren-Mercedes  old fan here & a McLaren fan still, I appreciate and enjoy these videos so much, I fear I'm gonna turn to a Mercedes fan :D Well, no... but I can still admit that you are doing a fantastic work, being a great team of people :)
Here for the technical food review.
"what is your favorite curry?"  *braces for James' entire life story*
Must be a Portugal thing, yall were lucky it didn't start snowing between sessions like Montalegre a few years ago haha
Calling it Curry Evening is so James
How much HP would an engine lose when entering a default/safety mode such as what happened on sunday?
Valtteri Bottas Yes, you were screwed again. Don't worry any time you get pace this will happen because you have the worst luck or are they holding you back?
THANK YOU FOR DOING THESE VIDEOS!!!!! I LOVE STRATEGY
I look forward to these debriefs almost as much as the race
Update your driver line-up!
How does team decides who will go on the podium for representing the team? I would be delighted if I get an answer 🙂
James: I have a mild tomato allergy.  RB: hmm 🧐 💡
"Everyone, it's James."  Jokes aside, it's nice to hear from you!
Ferrari wait for James' debriefs with a pen and paper at hand!
Why have you won so many championships again, curry nights or rare participation?
I love the description of the curry night, he uses the same tone as for race critical events x)
Went down like a treat 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Red bull will definitely beat y'all this week💪
“The perfect car” book in the background…now, i understand everything🧐👀
James🔥🙌🏽
Always admire & love the honesty of the Mercedes team.
Always enjoy these 👍🏼  Also 👍🏼 for Roman’s Ride !
Chicken korma and keema naan for life!
Thanks for the debrief James
Wasn't Max's pit stop 2.3 seconds & Valtteri's 3.3 seconds? Would that have given Valtteri enough time to get the tires up to temp?
what happens with the failed sensor?  is it for sale?
Err, James, you said you miscalculated the gap and the "only fix"for Bottas was to have another 0.4s in hand to keep Verstappen behind, but wasn't his pitstop something like 1.4s slower than Max's?
Why did you guys used different angle rear wings on bottas & Lewis? I think bottas' wing was making slightly more downforce, isn't it? So he was slower on start finish straight. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Curry always works :P !
and here I thought snap oversteer was a myth...this fella seems qualified though...
Bottas stop was NOT fast enough also it was 3.3 or 3.5s i think and Lewis stop was 2.5s so if that was the case with bottas max wouldn't have overtaken him atleast for some laps.
Were you saying you will develop default modes for sensor issues as a contingency, or you guys already have? Say in #77 case, you catch the issue and kill the sensor with a keystroke knowing that it won't affect anything else on the vehicle in the future...
Love the fun questions! I don't have Twitter, but can we ask questions on YouTube?
kick Bottas out of that car 😅 this guy did a divorce, sacrificed everything he had and still is not near the best drivers, that must be hard for him😉
Valteri , It’s James!
Valtteri it's James
Where is the best place to ask a question about next GP?
A grand prix is truly never complete without an F1 Race Debrief. Love the content.
I suppose, it would be too much to ask to get lewis, Vettel, verstappen, Alonso, Kimi and lando to also partake in this test day with Grosjean ;) then have say, a race format?
Finally my Portugal Grand Prix weekend is done.
Will you replace Bottas??
Okey but most important question is  why Bono changed his glasses?
Legend has it that watching videos on the Mercedes-AMG F1 YouTube channel will help you if you're feeling anxiety.
James, the real reason Valteri lost his second place, was a slow pit stop (3,3sec).... if he has a 2,5 sec like Lewis he would finish in second....
Thanks again James and Mercedes AMG for these insights 😎
This is by far the best content made by any team. Thank you for sharing these with us!
Could you guys do a video introducing us to your amazing social media team? They really do a phenomenal job and they should have their moment to shine!
Butter chicken's a good choice. Curries don't have to be spicy to be enjoyable!
When you see james volwes in a debrief you cant skip it👀
Love these debriefs!!!
I love it when the odd funny question or two pops up like asking James what's his favourite curry. I remember from I think the Tuscan GP last year that James and Shov were asked what their favourite pizza toppings were and Shov went into a detailed explanation about his favourite pizza topping. Keep it up team- it's what I love about this team. On track serious and competitive but off track there is that funny and chilled side
Thank you Mercedes. You are No 1
Just want to say that after Mercedes offered Grosjean a private test drive at Paul Ricard my love for the team only increased. It really is a fantastic gesture and I'm proud to say that Merc is my favourite team
Well in always looking out for the debrief..instead off sky always interviewing  Horner after every race like theres no other team principle....
I don't like that blue mist that runs over every photo. Odd.
Grosjean testing for Mercedes news was 😍 Also, can I get a red heart Mercedes?
You might be allergic just to tomato seeds. I have a friend who is, but if I de-seed the tomatoes before cooking, he's fine. Might be worth investigating. And there's nothing wrong with a mild curry - I quite like spicy food, but will generally order a sweeter curry because that's what I like
I would´ve liked to hear a bit technical aspect about the different rear wings Bottas and Hamilton were running. Also you forgot to mention that you slightly messed up the Bottas pitstop when it was 3,3 seconds if i remember correctly. There is the tenths you needed to get Bottas infront of Verstappen. I could guess Redbulls pitstop was faster than yours.
Another one I was really waiting for. But there's still time for a popcorn pitstop. I'll be back in 2 minutes. 🍿👀
his pitstop time wasn't good you guys took 3.3 secs for his 1st pit when max overtook him that time should have been in 2.4-2.5 secs than that would have helped Valtteri to defend his position much better.
They turned down bottas car remotely clearly he was fastest
Wait if the mediums and softs kinda behaved the same then how did the mediums last more than the softs? Idk if this question is silly cuz I'm an engineering freshman and not experienced like merc engineers😅
Can you guys explain tyre temperatures please.
The thing that I wait for the most more than the race. Mercedes is the only ones that give us this insight. 💯
Brown gang coming at debrief talking bout curry 😂😂🧡
@Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team  Is there any thought to the effect of wind on low rake vs high rake cars? With a low rake car possibly being less affected by crosswinds and vice versa.
How did Lewis manage to do back to back push laps in 2020 but not in 2021?
I just love the fact you take questions from fans and answer them every week Even if I am a fan of some other driver but you have my respect Note - everyone's a Vettel fan even they say they aren't they are Vettel fans
Amazing how Valtteri always has a "slow pit stop" or he "loses power" or his engine "fails" 🙄 anything to protect the ego of the narcissist
Raise your hand if you wanted valteri to win the race and give max and Lewis a tougher fight for the wdc
Mercedes you delivered a great race in Portugal! Loved it- strategy was on point (besides the tyre slip ups).  Onwards to Spain and hopefully a record-matching consecutive race wins at a circuit by Hamilton to Senna and beating Schumacher's win record at Spain too!
At 9:47, James says *partaked* isn't of partook. The closed captions (cc) had the correct word 😁
Really appreciate that you make the effort to get good subtitles on your videos. Makes them so much more accessible. Or allows people to watch the video on one screen on mute whilst they are on another screen having a work conference call...
Nice choice to get Romain back on the track that's why I love Mercedes because it's making the best choices
It’s the Race Debrief absolutely the best time of the week   GG on the win guys, onto Spain 🇪🇸🙌🏻
Great video.  I like your youtube fan engagement.
Great job 👍👍
Women do not buy Mercedesses?
“YouTube it’s James”
The room sounds tinny and off guys plz take the audio as seriously as you guys take your car plz!
Why are Mercedes pit stops so relatively slow to Red Bulls?
James
Perez would disagree with the mediums not being a robust tire
The strategy was spot on!
I agree with curry concerns.
Can we just talk about how soft and calming he is
A treat for the couriosity and also for the ear. These videos from Merc engineers are always great. Thx. 👋  And also: Bon apetit! 👍
Good weekend.
Nice to see Romain Vandoorne getting a drive for Mercedes 🇧🇪
Yes Mercedes great vid fair play team 🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏
I wait impatiently for the debrief like i wait for race weekend.
SIR LEWIS HAMILTON ES UN FENOMENO !!!!!!
Is water wet?
9:27 I love how you guys answer these pointless questions as seriously as the other more serious questions. 😂
Excellent insight, cheers to Hamilton and Bottas for demonstrating amazing skills under conditions that made the field struggle.
Mercedes just displaying the usual excellence! #8 on the way for Lewis
James isn't as excited about curries as Shov is about chiles, and that's okay.😂😂
As a south asian, hearing James talk about curry and how it’s a regular meal in the team it made my day. 🖤🥘
Keep up the with the winning recipe James❣️
Incoming Mercedes announcement to start selling food truck
Everytime I watch I get distracted by the background, guessing what the items are then I have to hit rewind. 😂
Everyone at Merc is very pleasing to hear , even james™
Each session FP1, FP2 & FP3 set the basis in utilising the understanding of high downforce & undulating elevation gradients around sector 2 in particular, where prior ensuring Turn 5 & 6 were dialled in in entry to Portimao Turn 8! The characteristics of the track suited the car!Astute tyre management of the yellow wall medium tyre compound likewise generating the capacity optimum temperature window, excellent navigation particularly through Sagres, Portimao & Galp corners! Excellent tyre management of the yellow wall medium compound, exceptionally smooth through Lagos  throughout the first, awesome through the second sector particularly through Portimao & Sagres, brilliant amount of traction generated through the Galp corner onto the straight!
"The only fix would have been to bring Valtteri one lap earlier." ... " Or give him a 2.5s pit stop instead of 3.3s. Pits tops are a constant weakness for MB. Shov admitted this in a previous debrief. Why can't MB be consistently quicker?
The most important question according to me in this was" How are you James"? . Wishes to everyone working hard there
Great job mercedes!!!  Proud of you guys!! 🤚🤚😀
I want to try the W10 also😂😂
Mercedes food reviews?
Don't worry, we won't tell anyone about your curry choices James:)🤫🤐
Ok how many James' do you have in the team?
Valtteri it's James
Good job of explaining by James, eventhough the strategists made two (minor) mistakes, pitting Valtteri a lap too late on to the hard and pitting Valterri too early on to the softs. Great content keep it going Mercedes!
Romain walked up to Stoffel at the bar: 'I need your clothes, boots and motorcycle'
Great work work guys keep on smashing the competition with the GOAT
The curry talk is going all season long eh? LOL
Mom: it's time virtual class Me: i am in the virtual class right now  The virtual class:  Great to see a romain back with mercedes guys❤❤
FINALLYY
What a reaction from crew for vallteri's pole so much excitement ... Said no one ever
Tell Toto dont change valtteri to george....team vb and lewis are good equally💙💜
Props to Mercedes for letting Grosjean have a test in the W10 👏
Good race in Portugal  You are the best 🔥🔥🔥
Good to see Grosjean back in F1👍
Lewis had some pace to pass verstephan and valteri
Lewis won because "Valtteri it's James"
